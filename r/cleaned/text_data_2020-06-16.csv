We’ve reached point...years ago. ""well grandma gonna die eventually anyways..."" I'm seeing handful markets/neighborhoods I'm familiar with. Prices look exactly pandemic. Must happening different price range different markets usually search. really sad actually think started correctly. Shut schools nursing homes asap. just, whatever happens happens since opening up.

It sounds like maybe phobia face covered ? get past user name tbh get saying, don’t think want live anymore. hope one day I’ve abroad.

Good riddance Yes, went every particular major restriction explained believe one could major effect. restrictions probably helped extent, come on, 7x deaths simply Sweden close schools restaurants? 

Also Finland getting infection flares dropping dead now? restrictions remaining. Helsinki center crowded usual. Virtually one wears masks either. life basically returned normal. Here’s 5 hour riot video lots improper mask usage going here. dc. Fewer masks. act like something political... don’t care protest riot please don’t start outbreaks thank you.

Oh yea - looked math real hard. ever stops making mathematical sense, I'm booking first flight town. They're freaking putting NY numbers, he's brushing off. disaster could make nursing homes like hospitals, would people live them? Nursing homes ""long"" term care -- days. residents would need isolated allowed interact one another. common areas, bingo, eating meals together. Interactions staff would minimal always full PPE sides. home supposed like *home*, jail. 

An unfortunate reality half died COVID nursing home year would died causes already. mortality rate 53% first six months. We're pretty much going circles - Yes, several work monkeys animals trials promising, statement holds true there's still never vaccine that's made widespread use humans.

The exist particularly relevant, good starting blocks, exist yet, answer person's question same. read ""Surprise! Arizona mayor tested positive COVID-19""

lol good insight actually, I've never made connection discouraging multi-generational family units enormously increases consumerism. everyone need land, house transportation, essentially objects could shared purchased again. frustrating think much unnecessarily waste it. could underhanded insult directed Jefferson county city Birmingham. Sweden Pretty grim. Respiratory Therapist working Montgomery. currently number one state covid cases. ordinance brought city council require citizens wear masks public. voted 5 4. Several doctors came speak council prior vote. Unfortunately, fell deaf ears. One council member ( Brantley Lyons) also lawyers said would “violate constitutional rights.” told hospitals lead pulmonologist. wish joking. want write Mr. Lyons email honestly don’t even know begin One craziest thins learn healthcare hospitals fight keep patients within parent companies network. there's test can't they'll try send patient 100 miles away days sister hospital rather sending 30 miles road right competition. Unless life death fight tooth nail keep profitable patients, even detriment patient. flip side they'll try dump people pay competition. 

So even worse us simply working together. Hospitals actively work one another. time? may suggest r/Memphis low cost living, cheap power great BBQ Insurance companies well know charities...  Thats :( Im NYC normally go back Xmas every year going happen year. daughter mom devastated. top don’t get unemployment haven’t since Covid happened effects visa (I freelancer run business online) dried 10% 

So I’m poor, can’t see fam roof head. partner help need (even tho poor right lol) plenty time make bread, learn French help daughter guitar. tell ya I’ve learnt live smallest budget still make good food! 

I’m worried something happen family tho I’m away I’ll deal happens. I’m also happy Australia dealing right way. wish America . It’s really frustrating. It’s like biggest mess event many inept group leaders disagree Yeah definitely, I'm going mask whole time! cardio gym I'll wearing whole time. thing actually got pretty sick January, almost symptoms COVID I'm fairly positive it. Facebook already announced adjust salaries people choose WFH indefinitely, even current employees. imagine tech companies follow suite.

It's complete bullshit, imo, especially companies actually profitable. obviously afford pay salaries imo skills workers worth less moved away SF. they'll line pockets extra money, people wanted move away better quality life necessarily get to. (Though crowded congested Bay Area gotten, honestly even taking much lower salary elsewhere could create higher quality life, depends priorities are.) gonna lie, I'm currently considering living car next semester afford paying school. figure could either homelessness school, risk homeless school, homeless school least access free pizza events showers campus (...if gym open.) cannot imagine that. Wow. affordable, that's matters! was. debates always boiled ran shit campaign largely consisting like Trump. absolutely nothing woman. Clinton name also stigma husband. realize people like jumping lower rates prevent crash happening? countries figured out. 

Why okay ""greatest country world"" utterly failing point really care.

You care hundreds thousands people dying sociopath. institution. Central Texas, hour Austin ish. $1250/mo gets niceish two bedroom apt appliances/patio often gated entry. sure 1 2 bedroom, help give regional perspective. - Dr. FUCCI? Alabama. want that, go Atlanta. there's thing - umbrella immediately feel benefit it. I'm wet - umbrella I'm dry.

With masks, protecting something invisible - something may present all- something know sure working (because goal get sick) see others getting sick without them, wonder need uncomfortable wear one day. Masks fun - wear protect others. probably see many people carrying umbrella-like contraptions let get wet, kept person next dry, esp. sure would someone showing contraption keep dry get wet. 

We confronted selfish ignorant American society truly is. super depressing. South Carolina begin report probable Good Yes, it’s especially conspiratorial it’s major, real world, international conspiracy centralize social control hands expense many.

Unless course it’s simply coincidence major inter-generational social engineering agendas money influence support coalescing like never history civilization.

Pure coincidence.

Funny coincidence theory tends get benefit doubt comes societally transformative events, despite evidence contrary conspiracy regular occurrence highest levels power influence society.

This doesn’t surprise anymore, people hopelessly ignorant history aren’t capable processing what’s going around right now, given lack context perspective understand what’s done past how, extent old strategies updated revised modern context advent technology mass media.

Believe whatever want, unlike popular narrative individuals organizations spending trillions dollars spinning masses gobble regurgitate without question, I’m dictate think believe.

If everything fine dandy you, end discussion right move along believing exactly corporate media big government would believe verbatim, I’ll leave it.

Otherwise, part recognizes shady shit going on, I’ll glad share resources consideration. heard me

&amp;#x200B;

yall fucking Like south, I'm looking move soonish cost living/housing #1 factor. exactly it. There's large cost switching tenants - marketing costs, time space goes unrented for, paint/carpet/deep clean new tenant comes in, taking risk nightmare tenant, etc, etc. 

When comes vast majority landlords would much rather keep good tenant slightly market roll dice.

But - people even try negotiate, landlords ask raise get without fight cases. good tenant causes problems pays rent time every month, leverage world negotiate increase. I'm renting Manhattan $7k month one bedroom. similar unit building recently sold like $2.5 million, 2 bedrooms $4-5 million, penthouse listed $40 million. afford rent, payment make ton sense vs. keeping money market

Salaries crazy high though. industries, make couple hundred grand per year moving LA NYC. difference grows vs. markets. surprised. Oxford's works monkeys, closely related humans, initial human trials showing humans build effective immune response. We're never coronavirus vaccine humans we've never needed one before.  thing hands though one buying damn plants flour. fail mention ultra low interest rates fueled this. Everybody buys houses based monthly payment. interest rates 6% again, nobody would able afford monthly payments. reason houses expensive right mortgage rates low. wife stayed employed. I'm happy people getting taken care of. I've destitute (a times) something anyone civilized place experience. Lol POS landlord property manager even bother sending renewal. nothing new suck ass.

Been gone month, still vacant! less 3K COVID hospitalizations 13K beds available, still handle 400% surge hitting max capacity Can't believe waited much Probably right go restaurant, right leave house something groceries, right keep small business open. sort things, exactly spelled Constitution sort inherent freedoms US. yes, probably careful giving freedoms government pick choose can't. How's Frank days? supposed lot? goal antibody testing informing individuals, tracking population level. false positive negative rates figured that. read posts? added ANYTHING except complain can't find house geographic area price want spend. 

I've actually given advice. example: expanding search, looking positions, reassuring people affordable homes available. think flying private/public disaster zone terrible idea.

By time running. New York like conditions outside. rationale would sold beginning, ""experts"" going extreme telling us need anything. setting like worst-case scenario blasted 24/7, messaging ""you necessarily need surgical-level mask work health care, need \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ least"" would much easier sell Fauci Surgeon General telling us work, three weeks later tell us must immediately. dunno, story two hairdressers Missouri symptomatic cut hair 140 people pretty decent evidence people wearing face coverings actually works tremendously well. hairdressers wearing surgical masks, based 50 clients able test, single one infected interaction.

A lot countries COVID situation control due high compliance face coverings. much evidence favor simple face coverings. Agreed, I'm happy uncle definitely right left pro mask entire time. hard wrap head around political all. I'm receiving side Rockland. Lots well-off folks dumping really expensive apartments NYC escaping lower population density here. Houses lingering folks hit medical financial issues get thrown out.

Edit: bad news schools open September (very iffy district), wholesale contagion. Everyone knows bad kids comes spreading diseases. Yeah strange media reported it, see way 1) got test February, 2) tested positive, 3) local media somehow report all, instead reported first known case area 2 weeks later. Yup, know quite people work Silicon Valley none going back year. say maybe sometime next year. Since curve exponential, bulk top 13 bottom range. rising Wisconsin like always. make price things go up... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s almost shouldn’t tax properties outta wazoo, instead tax land income. Smart owners raise lower rate perfectly match market. matter costs are, thing matters much people willing pay. #stillworthit last place rented raised rent $100 year. Completely depends live. suburban/rural area plenty space maintain distance others, feeling it, walk fine probably healthy you. urban area distancing challenge, would try avoid it. two weeks, us US crying uncle. money.

By ""lose money"" mean actually lose money, mean parasite less maximum possible labor actually working living? I'm paying $7k/month one bedroom Manhattan. unfortunate opportunity salaries way higher lot industries. company ever went permanent WFH, I'm outta here. many beds one part potential problem. enough trained staff available help patients extra beds? believe article recently stating already bringing trained ICU nurses state (another Banner location??). million beds good one available right skill set help you. We're going end 300k dead end year people like you. could've stopped ~100k-150k death cultists listened. video posted inability control arm swinging West Point commencement well ramp water drinking issues seemed having. knows? Trump lies much hard know tells truth full shit, tend believe full shit often truth gets awhile. alternate headline would read “Not requiring masks ‘safety hazard’ COVID-19 surges California breadbasket” Yup, last landlord. said treats good renters really well rarely raises rent finding good renter hard America. It’s gone around north east Ok, neocon. Thanks. I’m fine, family fine, lost 1 2 cats. Really things worked generally well. I’m happy way things worked insurance decisions move.

Covid effects us effects differently situation already in. is, I’m positive situation get worked end I’ll okay. About? crashing. Apartments going $4500 month going $2300 less. companies freaking sudden ""we're working remotely probably coming back *definitely* paying fucking prices"" movement. Damn even think drunks. scared going assuming everyone decent human least sure! totally get it. Manhattan isn’t everyone. friend mine (married 3 kids) makes $800k year doesn’t savings. asked broke like this:
$800k
Less taxes
$400k
Less 4 BR Manhattan apartment
$250k
Less private school 3 kids (as said “parents love children can’t send public school NY”)
$100k
Less stay-at-home wife’s expenses
$50k
Less dinners, travel, miscellaneous expenses
$0

Manhattan way eating away every dollar own. So, 2, 260, last 3 months?

Wow...nice headline Definitely. never applies Orange County :sigh: Meanwhile Trump plans surround thousands shouting fans indoors. People tech. pay $3500 make $200k isn’t outrageous SF. numbers ny state. clearer. hm checked countries Germany get tested usually pay it. Maybe different Sweden swedish Government seems decided Covid responsibility people. overview much test costs per country. countries going banned traveling vaccine. probably test everyone places, compared places like amazon warehouses test symptomatic ppl  us come toxic families even possible mentally even physically. 


Not everybody fallback. us go street. Man would report volunteering thing alone. Fuck 100% I'm sincerely trying understand coming from. seem operating assumption vaccine thus need naturally achieve herd immunity, therefor actually want disease spread.

Except appears vaccine happen. pretty much changes everything. vaccine widely distributed 2021, best defense becomes limiting spread much possible then. Masks help limiting far infected persons propel droplets public. basically forcing time need make informed decision make living arrangements.

many states laws specify notification needs made. OP wants faster movement send notice move out. Watch fast start trying offer deal.  letter names?

Damnit, knew something letter. bottom half letter even hole. Shit. like repeat history here.

Practice makes unperfect! people going back office spaces yet relying heavily temperature checks door... many people still coming back home overseas? (Rhetorical, nobody knows) figure would closed border even overseas Kiwis now. Probably late honestly I'm NY ""reopening"" far actually reopened anything. huge outflow people March, people left delayed coming back due riots looting (and media pretending happen real issue cops causing alot uncertainty people sure trust coming back place police ""can't"" stop people committing crimes now). We're going phase II next week, still much. think we'd really need wait Fall see uptick. Right now, city still pretty empty people things one wants walk around day heat humidity mask. So, saying someone comes appendectomy, test positive CoViD-19, person counted hospitalized CoViD patient?
Can send link links back up?

""Dwell time"" amount time patient remains ED they've diagnosed, they're waiting bed. nothing hospitalization rate.

Let's try different way. statistic metric would convince US handled pandemic very, poorly, midst real public-health crisis? Yes. 

Everyone says it’s lesson. one else listens needs lesson, means idiots get virus. 

“Yeah read 16 girls going bar, look, CHURCH isn’t bar. Yeah I’m close proximity 6 feet away didn’t hug anyone! 

Yet still got it. it’s lesson everyone!” 

“Yeah read 16 girls church group backyard bbq 40 best friends...”

And cycle repeats. 🙄 mean OPEN NOW, need haircut idiots? guy washington DC egging screaming LIBERATE twitter.

I blame him. almost Andrew Yang right nominated instead Biden 🤔 stupid thing they're fucking Florida. could met drinks outside kept distance maybe even happened. choose sharing shots inside bar never seeing human beings again, people weird acting like gray areas. downtown Los Angeles apartments offering 8 weeks free rent 1k signing bonus. apartment complex bullshit management group offered increase. website exact apartment three floors $300 lower. I’m literally moving 3 floors management group won’t let stay unit even better unit less expensive. would rather shut whole complex negotiate terrorists like us... almost moved spite. Like... let stay drop price appropriate amount. Tell 70 yr old mother went tour week. worry y'all masks .../s 

I realtors name trying calm calling ask conscience is. actually think might; language coming NBA heavily insinuates everything complete command league. Perhaps didn’t initially plan treatment associated staff, Adam Silver smart pragmatic person bet he’s considering now, already decided it. Ok lets digging in.

Its actual probability. trust institutions. history major, know long term cultural ramifications history often outstrip direct effects it. quote 2015 study topic entitled ""More Tuskegee: Understanding Mistrust Research Participation.""

""From historical perspective, Tuskegee syphilis study widely recognized reason mistrust extent duration deception mistreatment study’s impact human subject review However, history medical research abuse African Americans goes well beyond Tuskegee.

This topic debate. perception, rather right wrong.

BTW: undergrad degree also history, PhD qualitative research methodologies.

Tuskegee: understanding mistrust research participation. *Journal health care poor underserved*, *21*(3), 879–897. contract right? put everything table, technology exchange market. corp America choice accept not.
It's actually normality global trade. called North South technology transfer. China exactly thing Africa, time role. bought house 2005. rent old apartment ~230% mortgage payment is. 

Even accounting mortgage payment locked rate/cost past... means bought large home 15 years ago buy half 2 bedroom apartment. Actually probably one first places hit, place continue draw bandits survivors. would better place, preferably social network trade skills supplies. can’t hear Remdesivir convalescent plasma? I’m tired hearing stupid drug go there. put garbage there. There's still rules place. lot people breaking them. live OC grocery stores fine, but, see people gathering large groups friends totally disobeying mask policy lot businesses. honestly never end. Damn it. 

Take upvote. Ouch. Zing! really got 'em there! Care share interpretation quote? Ok funny Bible says man even Jesus knows God send back Earth. Oh yea, mean worst happening now...in 6-10 days surge hit.  May got 14% decrease rent moving better, bigger unit within building owned managed company. Please see edit last comment.

If find couch surfing NYC San Fran, going looking place live lot longer ""a days"" Well I'm priced city, too. fault thousands people moving too. Goddamn paying rent? discount??? Jesus, living midwest entire life made totally blind crazy Yankees west coasters paying rent/real estate. 2.5k square foot house made mid 90s safe neighborhood Columbus Ohio. paid $300K four years ago house. mortgage like 18 hundred bucks every month.  Plus people Alabama inbred genetically weak immune system Bbbaaaaaahhhhhh Sheboygan get around, can't she? 

Wocka wocka! “Y’All Queda”— I’ve never heard I’m stealing lol. think that's one bunch starfish wash ashore there's time save few? Dude literally every single comment written thread completely idiotic Question collective, concerning face shields: anyone seen studies showing Face Shield help with- added protection droplets, know help aerosol situation? People office longer wearing masks (except me) protects me, vice versa. gas mask, I'm trying figure face shield mask would provide protection virus aerosol form since air circulation system recycles air three floors building.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Anyone seen studies reports efficacy Face Shields aerosol/air borne virus particles? end May, Ilana Freund landed deal apartment New York City attending graduate school. roommate signed lease two-bedroom apartment West Village $4,995 month. significant discount: Similar apartments building going around $5,300 pandemic took hold, according listing agent.

Celebrating roommate saves $150 $2500 per month rent.

Cool slight dip, that’s still outrageous rent price two bedroom apartment anywhere world.

The major kicker drop broker’s feeds right now, regulation thing market reacting. spread would impossible, upticks many Northern cities. People hear want hear. Sure Governor making decisions even Governor okay opening's mean go. folks using common sense looking Federal government direction well well know getting guidance. world needs failures see victory others. 

Sadly, Brazil USA leading failures since leadership given think thing serious despite high death toll becoming.

India cusp disaster despite best efforts, due combination high population density poverty.

Possibly Russia, nobody knows sure going there, since doctors seem keep falling windows. Yep. Freedom allowed whatever want. also dealing brightest bright here. Hope lots fun good drinks night, may last good time awhile wallets savings might burn away hospital bills. single handedly blaming protests including fact states eased restrictions soon/ given people perception it’s “all over”? Yes sadly states things vary much. completely depends state in. Every one reports testing results differently testing availability capacity vary tens thousands day day state state. Seems like fake news ask specific slaughterhouse. simply care workers Yes, favorite Winston Churchill quote “A lie gets halfway around world truth chance get pants on.” true, shit, plague killed third Europe scariest thing imaginable ancestors easily treatable basic antibiotic DeSantis blood hands Dear lord baby Jesus really. Bill Clinton candidate carried Arkansas since American elections started becoming divisive Clinton Arkansan lot southern charm least that’s older Arkansans told me. Prior 1992, States voted uniformly exception 1976 election argument made AR voted Carter. However, 76 weird election.

Couple best friends AR place multiple times. Outside NW AR, Little Rock, state extremely red opinion continue remain so. Yes is. It’s already bad food banks, demand way up. Nah sf bay area Alabama here, got beat! like 3 100! Haha screwed... Lol omg fire Proverbs 22:3
The prudent see danger take refuge, but simple keep going pay penalty. I'm hoping. Thanks encouragement lol Tuskegee ethnic cleansing. ""these people worthy respect human beings, let's use guinea pigs see happens allow syphilis go untreated, allow take home loved ones."" 

Now add history shitty education system, racist discrimination everyday life(including healthcare), president known white supremacist whispering ear every day, medical/scientific community demonized officials potus city council members random facebook memes, vaccine that's rushed(for good reason, still). try best look objectively make decisions accordingly, absolutely understand lots friends relatives trust issues comes things like this. sadly self fulfilling prophecy, since mistrust means community misses representation scientific research. course, skin... or... way. Sorry hear that. That’s easy recover even good times, hope you’re okay least! Living Airbnb hotel days apartment hunting terribly bad thing you? know middle world wide pandemic protests riots happening world well? aren’t exactly talking roof head, street “homeless.” overstating impact individuals' emotional expression here. dismissing main reasons China attacked heavily. geopolitics, supremacy USA, global domination US Dollar, regional military conflicts, ideological differences, high tech competition, vested interests group, goes on. 

To simply direct cause everything towards ppl like quite superficial seems merely argument tactic. 

And honest, think right side world, better understanding things, ultimate truth knowledge topic debating. effortless make lose simple keyboard exchange. instead emotionally blackmailing opponent make feel bad doing.

The whole conversation started someone saying Chinese started admit situation grave responding person pointed Chinese bots gonna downvote comments can't take criticism, zero legit criticism ranting, clearly bother read article title. 

So work better u help fill empty ""criticism"" help prove point instead lecturing write response. Hmm heard before? Ok Google, help COVID-19 crisis ? 
Advertising ! I'm sure Catholism thinks it. apocalypse cover religious education classes - I'm pretty sure called bible, well revelations. get confused Catholic, Anglican Protestant. I'm non theist would love see four horsemen. end pandemic going anytime soon, it?  Mucho texto buddy. Yawn can’t believe using South Korea example, go compare Sweden. people even difference democracy countries. Sounds like want world that’s communistic. 

Edit: said asked before(in another reply), eradicate Commonwealth?

Edit: New Zealand still commonwealth government. UK goes down, go down. Sweden least problemS Typically, does. viruses thrive cooler climants, everyone expected round two fall/winter. 

However, I've read one resistant warmer temps like others. earlier reporting. sure they've updated thought. least NY got shit together prevented worst case scenario. chucklefucks give two shits Scarface one members Geto Boys btw, song.  Florida resident: people frustratingly stupid. one wears mask, whenever anyone mentions stats, ""fake news."" cant wait get South. think rational people anti lockdown protests us equivalent like 10 airliners crashing week weeks end one gives shit. Smart. I'm going nursing school atm shit classmates say make 👀👀 Literally matters public health.  say that? said NYC getting better. somehow disagree this? agreed part saying yes, Arizona etc worse. sure you’re aggressive agreement? You’re clearly confused. No, echoed saying time. wrong, admitted it. lie literally idea virus works. also told us lives surfaces days wash everything comes home, saying transmission kind extremely rare. lie, told us knew time, knew evolved, told us that. Obamacare mandate free vaccines health insurance plans? 90% wore almost start Spain. Weird response different. UK low numbers too. I'm told friend maybe 20% wearing supermarkets etc. short, Japan's health ministry's antibody tests new coronavirus conducted earlier month suggested 0.1 percent infection rate Tokyo, 0.17 percent Osaka Prefecture, western Japan, 0.03 percent Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan. means first wave infections contained certain degree, many people remain vulnerable infection.  graph makes wonder whats going Nigeria think handling thing fantastic. 1. dozen restaurants
2. Temporarily closed sanitize 

You’re welcome. long surgeons wear masks operate? coworker trying say surgeons damaged brain cells? type people coworker wants performing surgeries - brain damaged surgeons wearing masks??? agree facts, might still give slight misreading. beginning curve lot tests done exclusively NY, point mayor outbreak. peak 18k tests nearly 50% positive. 

The point time **weren't testing nationwide now**, lot negatives missing early data. would done number tests USA yesterday example April, people state yesterday. would much lower infection rate 4,5% finding today.

One problems generalizing data entire USA. decline NY hides increase states. 

Look example differences USA European countries. Nearly every one reduced total number daily infections 80% early peak. USA reduced 30% max. read nationwide R0 rate reduced much European states. Looking per state see why, NY reduced numbers tremendously, hides slow increase spreading throughout USA. states lockdown early may.

Now last weeks USA EU states reopening, R0 increasing. baseload already higher USA, problem quickly overwhelm hospitals R0 gets much 1. reopening economy USA, especially political actors pushing people take seriously, could really spiral control real quick... 

If want try find more, download dataset JHU via github  remove NY dataset. did. case there’s pandemic downtown. fred meyer 20th&amp;burnside safeway 13th&amp;lovejoy. counted walked safeway today, 1 mask every 20 people, including group 10 bunched together taking photos, store 1 mask every 10 people, people completely disregarding arrows.

like, i'm estimating based remembering, specifically made point count. downtown/oldtown much lately avoid public transit that's experience there. even healthcare workers bad mask use. office requires masks everywhere except you’re alone office cube. don’t want hint liability someone getting sick work. Makes sense me. Ikr lol Yeah fair enough. heat kill sure!

It continues grow stronger warmest states. Governor taking seriously. live NYC don’t even know dozen directly... safe. sad indeed. Um yeah Rioting looting important exactly? 🙄 means FL absolutely fucked head, think many us knew anyway Sure 2k deaths horrible headline misleading since suggests single-day deaths suddenly increased hundred 2000 true. backlog.  Interestingly enough read study 8/10 Americans dealing depression (many onset post COVID era). American depressed even 5 decades ago. 20% feeling probably following trumps lead forgoing PPE leaving house chill bars congregate close proximity hot spot areas.... Fatalities reported causes, unknown. going since April 200-300 week. excess deaths high. literally guy car repair shop try shame wearing mask today. even started walking staff within earshot thank wearing masks because... people wearing masks infringes rights somehow? Even crappy 20% protection helps happens filter enough virus get sick. Small amounts virus get sick. filter, even percentage low, better. worried live America, think they’re stupid. issue government handled extremely poorly, nothing really controlled. desperate open economy .... that’s stand. It’s disappointing. Lol that’s big orange idiot doesn’t even meet anymore. “This science nerd says lot stuff pandemic don’t believe in, I’m gonna go ahead cancel meetings golf instead. Also, make note shit Obama golfing much presidency” Yeah always thought that. every aspect life. right think probably never know, unless compare others turn bad situations. screw look retrospective say ""I done that"". watch 15 seconds sound bite everyone passing around know bragging much testing throwing shade countries testing enough.

That's disingenuous said all, bragging much testing throwing shade China countries stopped testing testing little suddenly problem. know unless watched full 30 seconds second 15 cut well know one thing, summer making go away like Trump said would That's lot cases little test. Holy crap! Idk would get downvoted. shit actually happened China. sub criticizing China? require hospital care usually around 10 days 

So 1-5 get sick, 10 days till admittance trust china Chinese vaccines. fact sign statutory declaration not, circumstance, take covid vaccine made China. hate Trump, dipshits make defend him?

That's disingenuous said all, bragging much testing throwing shade China countries stopped testing testing little suddenly problem. know unless watched full 30 seconds second 15 cut What's saying - ah, safety numbers - wait, apply virus? But, there’s also widespread view nobody believes anything comes China. there’s war 2 years long Americans... Covid what..4.5 months? Fauci said reason USA delayed mandating masks hard even get enough hospitals didn’t want non-medical personnel taking supply needed there. Hasn’t spoken weeks.....we really needed headline this? ‘reports’ getting lazier lazier Jesus Christ. interesting see. One person building church, jail, slaughterhouse, old age home etc. seems spread quickly many inside. That's disingenuous said all, bragging much testing throwing shade China countries stopped testing testing little suddenly problem. know unless watched full 30 seconds second 15 cut Next thing telling think Trump dumber bag hammers think get $1 million medical bills get sick police shoot sight feed racists Hmmmmmm, wonder why? No, never seen one 15 yrs here. got mask within first week, would guess 80% wearing then. Week 2-3 90%. mandatory. buy anywhere now, including N95 masks.

Edit. Spelling  worry China rolling one paying attention Reading articles US Tasmania Australia (with active cases) super surreal. psyche Americans strange me, going back normal everything yet there's record numbers still reached. worried? Hey that's Texas governor says too! Hes also started blame young people wearing masks yet wear made local government can't make masks mandatory. Add using public restroom list things loooong time. lives 50 million dollar home tennis court, multiple gyms, multiple pools...do really think works place $29 membership.....come man...this story joke. that, don’t hear many beekeepers quoting Murphy’s Law get stung even though technically applies too. went crowded bar without PPE global pandemic got virus...that’s less “whatever go wrong” “whatever likely go wrong” contrast know anything anything? school hosted drive senior send off, displeasure watching science teachers lower masks mouths talk one another sitting much close together. Keep 20 year olds locked die nursing homes? Western press smearing chinese virus response order instill defeatism readers. Ultimate aim justify nothing many Western countries tried first place. amateur numbers - New York peaked around 10,000 per day. “I don’t necessarily think study representative transmission risk,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar Johns Hopkins Center Health Security Maryland, tells Health.

While agree article overall appreciate link, he's saying absolute bullshit. absolutely representative risk scientists involved study knew literally EVERYTHING people before, after, health histories, families health histories, got restaurant,.what left.

For criticism China, granularity data available many cases breathtakingly complete. article, prior, says doctor's assertion true study replicate lab conditions. hell real life replicate lab conditions? that's we're waiting for... seen done yet? literally THOUSANDS opportunities get condition research want pretty much every U.S. state? kind dirty science saves lives people listen shit scientists. 

If look seating chart restaurant air flow study done, plus people contracted corona sat - PLAINLY OBVIOUS HVAC system caused spread. explanation makes sense whatsoever, especially considering people infected directly corresponds seated within flow ventilation system. stream air flow infected individual - infected. I'm sure used bathrooms, touched door handles, whatever else, virus spread airborne viral particles carried ventilation.

If U.S. scientists paraded news every night actually gave us something American data besides number tests... positive negative... deaths... maybe hospitalizations lucky.

The lack contact tracing available info U.S. absolute joke considering gigantic number positive cases. yet closer answers papers go used data countries released two months ago. Staggering, really... noses thing people cracks up. want wrong. 

Not pants, would pretty funny. think divisive president may something sadly. like cancer anything, ya know. exactly....he tennis court. multiple pools massive gym...this story joke. Fecal oral transmission people 

Soiled people cleaned 

Etc etc 


Tough environs News learn please. Next article: grass green. Yes, noun adjective verb finally adverb. Glad turned work trip hospital Florida Trump gets COVID still don’t think that’s enough take crisis seriously. obviously wants pretend doesn’t exist took Boris Johnson ending ER UK take reasonably seriously.

Someone get sick die so. Executive branch, senator, someone high place. get it. people party seem incapable empathy something happens them. Mind you, Governor I’m Arizona says fine since hospital beds available. good chunk capacity now. fucking sucks. intentionally chosen low IQ's. Ya gotta really stupid lick Trump taint that's way keep jobs... Spain strict lockdown, almost everyone voluntarily wore masks. it’s obviously getting worse, holy shit think area somehow getting better pandemic virus spreading around

So clear, read **Lol it’s obviously getting worse** saying it’s getting better? Great reading comprehension Honestly think protests riots broke lot people. small group antilockdown people protest media wont stop talking putting people danger virus going lead spikes on. two weeks later, kinds excuses ok BLM protests. created clear open display hypocrisy directly connected think lot people saying clearly, big deal came conclusion 2016. story BS. lives home multiple pools gym...golds garbage.... No, burned protest. They’re wrong. They're probably getting antibody infusions regular, us lowly people get sick die. give perspective so-called “responsible” individuals, lot ones I’ve spoken essentially rationalized although virus deadly it’s something live. spoke old colleague today working hospital. Unmasked, told opinion become seasonal. pressed wearing mask, said wasn’t problem. He’s young, healthy knows one virus. area live experiencing tremendous spikes cases since death toll isn’t akin NYC’s, lot people don’t care.

They don’t see tangible risk daily life, try go back normal. people originally quarantine operated assumption pandemic far serious. They’ve convinced it’s anymore. People don’t like unelected Representatives start trying infringe upon inalienable Constitutional Rights. it’s well intentioned doesn’t mean it’s tyranny. One undemocratic institutions ever She’s figuratively diving bees nest, got stung, said “whatever could’ve gone wrong went wrong”. Guess you’ve got technicality here, much less “whatever go wrong go wrong” much “a huge risk could bite ass bit ass” feel even knows that, hence “I guess” statement events actually beamed live via satellite performed, since raw event, even includes setup shit normally put commercial breaks over. broadcasting network captures it, records it, whatever broadcast commercials watermarks.

They're one events left still uses satellite ""in clear"", encrypted. apparently use date encoders, it'd trivial scramble it, don't. interest they're producing, appreciate they're total dicks raw feeds.

I hope nerd interjection informative. Maybe tested frequently. listen actual full speach, never suggested that. asking questions things scientists said. Trump style questions still questions. 2016 claim 100% hundreds participants. saying still 100% comes millions. true carbon dioxide (not monoxide, like comes car exhaust) harmful health effects, would think would pretty extenuating circumstances get level wearing mask.

Additionally, personally experienced COVID nurse wearing mask 12 hour shifts. sounds like misinformation people uncomfortable wearing long periods time. Hauraaaaawwwllllll Shutting everything year isnt something aim either. way life collapse. time attitude point ""don't worry it."" happens happens. almost 4 months. point really care.   cool states 'doing well' feels premature celebrate anything imo. Reducing cases 0 reopening exposing state risk infection dealt outbreak. know case specifically mass testing done meat packing plant nearby 50% staff infected. 90% asymptomatic. symptomatic people described mild symptoms attributed allergies. Nyc seems counter this. Lots cases, lots deaths, high prevalence antibodies. hand bump protests yet either. need project big dick energy. Yep still excuse. People weren’t allowed visit dying relative France, Spain Italy lockdowns. People died alone, buried alone. It’s tough deal it. number would lead national emergency somewhere else. FL though people chill... need better standards Yes, praying seen, good works praise extremely unbiblical, right.

I think difficult Christians though Hebrews 10:25 quite clear God's stop meeting together; make church top priority lives:

"" let us neglect meeting together, people do, encourage one another, especially day return drawing near.""

BUT also God's good stewards lives!! grateful church Pastor. made clear social distancing, staying home avoiding large crowds good stewardship. church small allowed open taking extreme precautions still posting live streams encourage members stay home. AIRPORT true, it’s concept age bracket, really still low think general good test ways.
Meaning tourist fron sweden travels area specific rules (mandatory masks, social distancing, hand sanitizers, etc) might even asymptomatic become symptomatic days point measures: prevent positive spreading virus.

Coming back risks rules avoiding uncontrollable spread.

Let's say week ago area girl brazil arrived amsterdam flying symptoms (yes!!!). Spent days around city condition worsened required hospitalization. drama far.  NJ least we’re right. don’t understand “about 95%” it’s fking estimate dipshit know, diet track things eat people eat aren’t ones look like care goes bodies lol. Eating slice pizza hotdog soda daily, yeah wether you’re healthy not, That’s bad, hey whatever makes happy. Oh yeah, state fucked next month matter do.

But hey, economy, amirite? Apparenly worth much shitload conservative greedy douchebags. It’s demand lot people want live near job there’s enough room. apts fixed prices you’d lottery system something. saying I’m it, people generally paying location apartment. Orlando airport February. last trip stuff went down. Crazy think half staff airport gotten sick since there. server bar get covid entire bar shuts week deep cleaning employees get tested.

Are telling NBA going least multi millionaire employees? Seems kinda weird logical me. Yeah - areas high traffic I.e. highest risk areas preventative rules abandoned quickest.

Our local Sainsbury’s queuing lines outside. Staggered entry, one way system inside.

But - you’re allowed pass aisles (less 2m wide aisles) according manager “if person doesn’t mind”... sucker born every minute. Nailed that. Would love visit Germany someday, still love America. disinformation Fox News politicians, surprising. concerned go bars drown sorrows...  Made China? thanks.  Mate world going shit sides contributing. get called making random percentages fit narrative can't handle it, typical response. don’t know believe this, community solid 30 people know contracted coronavirus us aged 18-60 recovered without complications. Ya sure worst illness I’ve ever life bad everyone else us? There’s something missing here... Plus hospitals designed operate constant capacity level - hospital may 100 ICU beds, normally 40 filled given time. handle sudden surge patients, can’t kept long time like get outbreak.

Then there’s fact COVID patients take long time treat - well month cases - beds aren’t cycling back availability pool right away. Meanwhile, expensive apartment pay still BBQ/pool/jacuzzi area closed down. 3 months. Rent still exactly same. WWI it’s simple, showed up. French, British Germans beat hell, lost millions men, showed fresh troops point, allies never going lose.

The infusion American troops basically allowed allies overwhelm Germans got treaty Versailles. Germany tried fight on, US sending million 1918 millions coming necessary. 

As WWII allies would lost without US, still could’ve lost even us, though mainland US never risk since gun loving country would hornets nest really one could overcome way hell that’ll happen. Daddy trump told open creates policy MAGAts call throw cause gubment. cannot make up. 

dumbasses taken advantage off, cause, rather believe fairy tales science. 

smdh. Fine, four half. point is? passed first wave Spanish flu long time ago. Influenza associated deaths first half year 10k normal levels, didn’t impose quarantines. hear you. Working retail made better customer. invisible worst, thought interesting article didn’t mention casinos reopening 2 weeks ago obvious. Yeah, really strict moment (my parents live can’t even cross WA viisit right now). think it’ll end good thing means it’ll safer actually get there! I'm arguing you. I'm simply explaining *my* philosophy. two competing ideas:

1. lives (and deaths) equal therefore lives (or deaths) special. USA global. 

2. Lives deaths equal, meaning certain lives deaths special

Therefore lives (and deaths) cannot *both* special *and* equal.

My attitude former (both towards covid towards life general). So, covid deaths, although suck, extra special.

None say try minimize death. course - minimization ALSO consider impacts things. non covid deaths, joblessness, poverty, education access, access NON-covid healthcare, mental health, manner issues virus *and lockdowns* caused. 

If weight costs umbrella lives equal (survivors deceased), *survivors* impacted things FAR outweigh lost virus. 

You free consider covid deaths special focus energies that, though. Test,Trace, Isolate? prof it’s successful. mean mention never elaborate. 

Test,Trace,Isolate? case procedure successful? mean many links Sweden links informative case involves Test,Trace,Isolate.  like shopping see need, grab one two items. We've month worried atm running low TP again, haha. Vitamins could bit better, definitely need find Vitamin C (which hit miss).

Stay strong cigarettes bröther sister, go here! Question then. fair consider persons immunity less fixed quantity? individual's immune system fought virus well first time develop antibodies, reasonably sure immune system generally always excellent fighting virus? 

We hear things like diet, exercise, stress, Vit levels, etc making difference well people's immune systems respond threats. immunologist think person who's immune system ""strong enough first time"" speak remain ""strong enough next time"" changes factors would unlikely make material difference?

Just trying get sense much factors we're told try control imporve immunity actually make difference. No. Read article. Aha...confirmation knows Rapture apply (;

You, Communist Chinese Party, Democrats. new A-team! !remindme 6 months it’s daily news cycle it’s happening. Next. wonder people scared 2nd wave 1st wave hasn’t ended  Obviously heart disease isn’t contagious. Also comment originally replied gave data TWO MONTH time frame. I’m saying comparing COVID deaths WW1 adds nothing conversation adds fuel fear mongering fire. nursing home, let go home cousins, gave home hospice care passed away. can't see harm good?

People violate social distancing touch faces way much. I've watch people go though doors finger inside mask pull up. 

The amount misuse insanely high. It’s important remember many cashiers working throughout pandemic, you’re faced general public every day, wears down. They’re complacent purposely, simply trying cope best friend's wife pediatric nurse. seeing kids come back recovered covid ongoing respiratory infections. Kids cardiac issues. know virus going someone people acting like gone. think quarantining longer economically impossible. I’m sure you’re downvoted asking reasonable question... 

I agree, feel like enough information make definite statements (in fact, “definitive statements” they’ve made found wrong anyway). feel like thing know sure Covid don’t know anything sure Covid. 

I suppose speak percentage people mild cases thus far seemed totally recovered. However, virus Max 6 months old you’re right say don’t time side factor use determining possible long-term effects virus. group ppl mild cases failing kidneys 5 years? high blood pressure year? Wind congestive heart failure line? don’t know. fair concern. think too. 

But certainly pessimistic government’s ability respond, default assume would fuck completely, like Katrina.

I also called “hysterical” times could count. never felt hysterical, even scared, friends/family/coworkers thought went insane.

Especially brought oxygen tanks home lol, hindsight may little top seemed like good idea time. Also got blood 02 monitors, bullhorns, blood pressure readers bunch tarps/duct tape quarantine section house. ready self treat home much possible one us got sick hospitals full. 

The bullhorns come handy though... gave friends BLM protests. saying determining origin disease scientific merit? difference course seen lot people protests wearing masks. they're outside. saying rallies? confirm. stretch even remember knew took comps. course “counts.” don’t need go hospital, people testing positive puts strain health care system tested positive rhinovirus. I’m sick tired people defining “resurgence” simply positive cases experts said repeatedly that, broadly speaking, biggest danger virus society impact ability health care system handle it. whole premise behind “flatten curve.” Give hospitals, nurses docs time catch able provide necessary care spreading time.

A spike positive tests absence spike hospitalizations and, worst course, deaths non-event broad perspective like spike common cold winter. Everybody’s got cold (also viral infection vaccine, btw) winter go hospital - it’s irrelevant many people it. pitching alarmist headlines follow makes frightened people panic even more. Hence, clickbait. Philippines spelled Ph Filipino spelled F? Unfortunate reminder cloth mask little prevent catching virus. real strength mitigates spread people. one around masking trying protect yourself, try find N95s possible, surgical masks not. middle ground. flipping shit middle ground. middle ground 'everything want'. Yeah sad true. Darwinism action. comment hurts soul Going presumably zero cases follow 300+ people women contact people contact 300+ people.

Thats pretty major fuck up. often get put genie back bottle. twice? true fair Italian provision quarantine direct ban mobility except work reasons (you could go law enforcement patrolled border). phase 1 lockdown could go supermarket village/neighborhood, every time needed print form stating good reason home, could walk 200 meters residence groceries/work/health reasons/walk dog. would probably fly US although proven effective. 

I think people comply don’t want cancel effects 2 months heavy sacrifices sure hell nobody wants go back phase 1 live LI, numbers lowest country, rate increase that's low, sheer number active cases still worrying. point, there's spike cases within next week, maybe people arguing lockdowns necessary point.

If cases spike though... well, one operating assumptions, exclusion zone still close by... necessarily. want see full data using fiasco Lancet study withdrawal.

They saying believe it, going press releases without data. That's honestly done. story, unfortunately. mask cure. takes touching contaminated surface, wearing mask properly. also learning new info every day. knows possible ways people getting infected are. , touch eyes mouth, wash hands back home. wear mask minimize rate transmition. There’s also daily thread /r/CoronavirusAZ excellent regular contributors. Every day daily dashboard posted regulars take data give reports running averages, hospital bed capacity changes, reports tests reported day taken when, etc. sub great resource. Lol define severe mean I'm apartment w/ air conditioning get neighbors?

A chart Banner Arizona showing number patients ventilator April 26, 2020 - June 3, 2020

With ICU beds filling patients going ventilators, Banner Health, largest hospital system Arizona, warning tough times ahead state.

This week, Banner tweeted state's steady climb COVID-19 cases last 2 weeks ""concerning"" ""correlates rise cases seeing hospital ICUs.""

The number patients ventilators Banner system quadrupled since mid-May, reaching 116 patients June 4, according Banner press release.

Banner also said reached capacity extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), though say many machines state officials insist enough ECMO machines place facilities.

""If trends continue, Banner soon need exercise surge plan increase ICU capacity,"" health system said press release.""

That's little stronger *might* problem.  No, duh, did. knows yet democratically controlled cities protesting 100's thousands. That's specify ""local cases"" exclude imported cases. that's also there's 14-day quarantine government-approved facility inbound traveler. Malls theatres basically bankrupt then. want feel stupid Personal protective equipment specialized equipment clothing use protect patients germs. creates barrier virus, bacteria fungi you. PPE includes gloves, gowns, goggles, masks face shields.

A surgical mask used cover nose mouth prevent germs entering. situations, mask called respirator may required. respirator fits tightly creates seal around nose mouth, order prevent small droplets entering body.

Keep mind respirators come different sizes. wear correct size, may protecting yourself. Healthcare facilities required fit test employees determine, size respirator use. 

Clearly droplet protection aren’t wearing surgical mask. Remember everyone including president ""oh it'll go away summer""? “you’re selfish piece shit”? “disinfectant” known man doctors would recommend put body kill virus? 

Please explain distinction bleach disinfectant. Exactly. buddy go eat finally went eat mad servers wearing masks.  going eat concerned this? terrible headline. actually read article, really said ""we can't guarantee anything."" said beginning this. fact is, we've got several promising candidates already PII/PIII trials, drastically ramped manufacturing already underway. I'd say there's decent chance one work. simple yes would surficed. 

Not one scholarly articles, huh? Simply passing something complex understand would *have sufficed*. wife works events company. status meeting said expecting revenue rest year. Everyone keeps cancelling them. miracle they're still business, they're making work somehow, least moment (not without lot furloughs planned office consolidation though). less time, might say Maybe cared essential workers flashy ones earn woke points would control. reason someone staying home unemployment paid someone whose job deemed essential. 

How restaurant business doing? think mother doing?

Sounds like exposing deadly respiratory virus described. society, taking risk like everyone else.

What babble even mean? think choice whether *""be society""* not? work life life regards around me, everyone else. I'm cowering home like seem think people blame someone else spreading disease failed take precautions protect yourself?

Alright, know trolling. blame *someone else taking precautions spreading contagious virus*? Shoo. I'm concerned first wave never stopped.  welcome DM Looks daily new cases graph

Read second wave

Scratches head Getting away disrupting thousands lives... simulate time passing by. Time needed determine many things. Wuhan dealing things longer anyone originated there. patient, stay safe. took seriously getting hit hard early daily numbers new cases deaths dropped significantly. definitely right trajectory (worried Fall that’s different matter...) problem requiring children work masks dance studios sports practice kids really get panicked find harder breathe normal. Why. go story run buttress point USA one represents prime illustration perils “relaxing soon” staying “relaxed” throughout? Thinking not. Guardian trash. Yeah feel waited he’d alright. died bran wasn’t even really bran anymore, that’s convo whole different day (bran sucked). take address phone number. random checks home get fined. girlfriend came US (she works Canada visa). quarantine 2 weeks. allowed leave house ever, may go outside property can't leave property (not even exercise). 

They never checked still fine like $1200 risk it. OSHA less useless directing employers dealing Archive link: http://archive.vn/z2rZK Ya think?! really trigger consider are. Hong Kong January, YELLED wearing mask streets, refused every public place around march.

In Europe people got serious late, MOCK you... wearing actively social pressuring others to... ?

Sadly nothing really changed since than... still vote people power... Even fact ousted corrupt. fertilise crops turd... Come want lift. hell 15 friends? wait cop Atlanta charged today. Shit going blow larger Floyd Protests. thing affect someone know. Many know sick. couple ended hospital. One woman hospitalized died. argument someone day adamantly insisted woman die covid.

Bullshit. way prevent almost 100% certainty stay house forever allow visitors.

If willing live like that, enjoy. people getting punched nonexistent dick became superpower somebody informed explain California? seem much stricter states experiencing surges. Well.. whole thing likely started one person. 8million confirmed cases likely 80million total cases 450k confirmed deaths. Viruses nothing play with. wonder reason people infected 

1. lockdowns still place many cities
2. fact CDC reversed course mask policy 

These two things that, right now, way see it, people seem actively trying undo. Wearing mask strangely turned political talking point? Cities &amp; states opening up, quickly, despite growing case numbers. 

I agree world cant stay closed forever, even really extended period, surely ways meet middle open up, still keeping safety mind? Game Thrones Same. strict hell. bad though liked free food. Hol up... woman,15? BAR?? Exactly. understand people deny serious virus be... widespread view America ...  don’t know you’re dude. longer read minds. NYC masked country. true higher percentage BLM protesters masked, also true worse job physical distancing. crowd limits also lot closer CDC guidelines. even carried inside cars, fully following guidelines. Speak yourselves

We donne virus north coast pretty nice too, could contiguous annexed lesser territories That’s different problem, though. That’s risk calculation. risk someone dying allow X business open cost company revenue simply staying closed. restaurant businesses, answer it’s worth staying open unless amazing umbrella insurance. Remove liability company like done meat industry open business cares people die. everyone else answer nuanced.

Some countries never closed. meant “fewer”.  unheard 80,000+ deaths caused flu years.

Everything else God unless there's another human face involved. bug. 🤷‍♀️ Trump’s like don’t really wanna hear it, like said, new cases stop testing IL 4k cases day month half ago 🔥🔥THIS FINE🔥🔥 Imagine viral loads many school aged kids college goers get. lot probably NASTY viral loads bad course virus. Let's crowd together. YAY!!! Lol right. helpful waving hands air. Ikr. Texans crazy!! :( spike cause! sounds like something North Korea would say snow...uphill...both ways....  Thats ok. June 16. Memorial day one week ago. One word: Propaganda. 
Not politics, PROPGANDA...  Take care there. Stay safe, visit things get better :) big spike non-covid deaths already there. filed Unclassified symptoms, signs, abnormal findings.

 Wow telling fecal matter air everywhere? Lawyers taxpayer funded Immigration Court Asylum. ....yikes intentional positive rate would high, it’s one lowest country. Deaths per capita also low. Texas done well, whether it’s luck not. UI, federal 600 portion ends end July, state alone, 240 taxes. don’t think anyone ever said that. Weird strawman protect fine, things like half/full-mask respirator cartridges would last month month used protect virus. filters designed stand extremely dusty industrial sites hours maybe day. Compared kind environment, using protect virus general environment means particulate count filters facing would low clog month.

I saw guide published 3M themselves. said industrial N95 respirators replaceable cartridges, used protect virus would last ""an entire outbreak season"", whatever means. takes someone family get die, they'll realize awful is. 20% foolish. legitimate concern. National media still reporting this, people clicking caring. become politicized even discuss improvements response, people especially interested news media says state pandemic.

I think pretty disingenuous try blame media one used work airport janitor working making sure job, saw many janitors standing around, nothing, manager told something. 

People shouldn’t playing games pandemic. Period. Also, staff gave negative feeling legitimately aren’t taking seriously enough. Well, did, us, including me, furloughed. woke up. 

This back April. ever know first wave really know percent population infected? mean, first wave could drag year, it?  I, also, concur  soon. first term House. Let get experience push board. think they're sick now... $13,000 treating covid positive patient theres guidelines treatment types. long they're overnight, get money. add actual treatments whatever else for?

Yeah that's power. like Big Brother steroids. deficit spending. SA seems mixed bag. ""*In Oregon, health officials trying contain outbreak 200 new cases Union County linked Lighthouse United Pentecostal Church.*

*The Oregonian newspaper reported video church's Facebook page May 24 showed hundreds people standing close together singing.* ""

I believe "" Congress shall make law respecting establishment *religion*, prohibiting free exercise thereof ,"" ... mean idiots; right be.  People still dying Covid-19 every day people also die shutdown Covid-19. true. people dye Covid doesn’t mean people don’t die shutdowns. would think would mutually exclusive? like 1 2 people staff wearing mask gym.

I one wearing mask. Yet people gave funny looks. Difference is, WWI killed young, healthy able Americans. Coronavirus killed ones already dying, final years life.  


Perspective. Ive learning many health sanitation tips year!
 
Ive never closed lid flushing. rarely get sick.. like year(if that) i’ll catch cold someone confronts wearing mask say: ""I one lung due cancer. long think I'd live got this?""  consulted Alfred E Neuman.

It’s possible anyways. Absolutely. wish would realize he's going get thrown bus Trump following white house reopening guidelines, even though know president wanted AZ open.

I think people really talking second wave social distancing stay home orders. Thanks! idea. also one rapping beat photocopier? I’m lazy google this. We’re fine now, much else say really. eventually came back everyone lost it. Every time  seen evidence US town city taking seriously enough general public. see lots masks, still seeing 15% defiant populus. One business go to, masks worn manager present. Lol, makes perfect sense.. put paperwork, theirs, would ever know included count? think huge government plot much hospital CEOs seeing opportunity make back money lost performing regular procedures. joke question? current white house collection dumbest, irresponsible children US. Right, added new edit mention exams probably offered many places, right now. something look go back normal.

What's nice every area needs bunch office workers. interested office work, even janitorial exams swanky janitorial jobs. also live super rural area without many job prospects still schools courts kinds places hire way. isn’t consistent. problem NBA playing October. baseball, outdoor sport?

Not trying call out, really compare virus Spanish flu. I'm entirely genuine, offer many sources people still worried play similarly. virus different handled much differently Spanish flu. absolutely love Mexico, AMLO bad leaders US Brazil this.  9 10 running around like pandemic never happened around here. sensible people move town?

This post going around people think virus big liberal hoax. Everyone comments agreeing it. think this? really wanted strike didn’t facts couldn’t say. Every country absolutely destroyed economic depression created. blows mind different prices across country Gov’ment: “Guess means need give Rich money.” How?

I wanted sell &amp; another house &amp; gave up. They’re picked second they’re market. I'm pretty sure beds, probably know due reporting delays accounting tricks. sister's ICU already full, Tucson Medical Center said they're full, Banner Health (largest provider AZ) said week ago they're almost full...

We're gonna see death rate skyrocket within week. we're probably going know couple weeks reporting delays. Spring Break hit tourism, hope worth governor Ron DeSantis. H-town comment Nationwide would even better. really think everyone could get board wearing mask would need another lockdown anything sort. seems simple yet people don’t want told do. crew USS Roosevelt got disease around consensus herd immunity threshold

Jaysus that's mammoth misunderstanding herd immunity works. like put 9 people room infected person, virus magically stop replicating infected 6 Considering duplex one side family, side tenants. I'm assuming property manager calls sort website-portal see maintenance requests relay tenant's messages? Hope she’s ok. Thank you! really helpful, study shields influenza indicates 80% effective airborne droplets 30 minutes 68% small particle aerosols.

Mitigation tactics mean you’ve already failed. Trying sell “herd immunity” means you’ve either failed catastrophically criminally negligent. obviously failed early on, PH initiative became “flatten curve”, developed-nationese OOPS! Sydney Correct. sister law got negative result. forgot told proceed false positive.  Didn’t mandate masks without him? Y’all must living well. I’m hoping corona takes family get inheritance finish college. 

For legal reasons, joke. Except Trump control lockdowns. impose one remove them. logarithmic chart used showing exponential growth, straight lines predict future trends. linear graph useless this. I'm Alabama super concerned differently social distancing adopted county county. reasonably wealthy educated areas like Hoover, walk around grocery store see people obeying distance rules wearing masks. People sanitizing everything really respecting other's personal bubble

&amp;#x200B;

However, go area like Woodstock pretty poor ""country"", see people walking around acting like virus even exist. masks, licking other's eyeballs, drinking eachother's beer, etc. lot basically think whole virus overblown political propaganda god protect silly bug like that.

&amp;#x200B;

The gap rich poor never evident, figure? total oblivious population months half assed lockdown 0 immune population we’ve gotten barely 100k 4 months.

I’d say maybe 200k-250k. Even countries like Spain, UK, Sweden let rip still 700 deaths per million curve nearly over.  vast majority people bowling alleys casuals balls shoes. bowling alley (used to) go required shoes. think safety issue, since bowling requires sliding, sneakers designed slide. Thanks, goofed one! 

Funnily correction Grammarly made add hyphen. Hahah Trump fucking rules man know did. said worldwide comparison virus vehicle deaths isn’t valid comparison. It’s even less valid compare year “normal” vehicle deaths virus deaths. Tuesday, mother 12-year-old member Graystone Baptist Church said family never notified possible outbreak, saying learned positive tests news.   
    Ayne Amjad operated outdoor clinic COVID-19 testing months Beckley said hearing similar complaints.  got several calls yesterday similar stories, whether workplace place else.""   worries test positive undergoing process called 'contact tracing,' process notifying people may impacted county's local health department.  
  according Dr. Cathy Slemp, also encouraging organizations outbreak notify members.   ask notify members public it,"" said Dr. Slemp Wednesday's press conference Gov. Jim Justice. ""We ask speak what's occuring make sure everyone community notified talk things keep people safe.""    Dr. Amjad thinks local health departments need play bigger role contact tracing coordinating testing affected. disagrees assertion organizations notify members. But, actually containing virus, convincing almost everyone wear masks common-sense things, eventually rescue economy.

People return stores, restaurants, bars, feel safe. before. false start increases amount time needed people feel safe.  so....small pox gone prior vaccines? measles still issue, even vaccine? Yet want impeach Wolf Yeah, need celebrities make video urging us wear masks. Possibly black white piano soundtrack 4. effective treatment inhibits effects virus lol got approved already overpaying. got 5-8% decrease. really fail understand even look infection death rate nationally looking individual states much reliable measure trends. Texan, really don’t give shit what’s going cities we’re damn big four metro areas treated like it’s state data purposes well. “I don’t give shit” mean care much every single person trends Dallas live Houston. great investments plan hold. NY going well also It'd even better set statewide mandate, least lets parts Arizona institute likely life-saving policy. absurd bad things get Gov. Ducey even come far, though. 2.6k today used live Cary IL. would paying $1200 + 100 year 2 bed room 1 bathroom small price. think around 600sq ft. apartments crap cheapest option :/ Yeah. lived place landowner upped much legal moved versus previous tenants increased rent minimum $100 month per year. found place buy first whined leave liked us (just two us versus previously house chock full students, plus let put lots cosmetic &amp; semi-cosmetic fixes). pointed regularly increasing rent making hard save place told ""you made money then"". Got really pissy ""things broken"" contested signed documentation photographs she'd never fixed since said leave in, change leave (we pets caused *minor* damage intending replace moved in).

The rent increases started ""I need enough money cover property tax, wear &amp; tear mortgage"" that, time, could buoy retirement, could take ""much needed vacations"" ""I get whatever want"", bailed.

After previously great landlord we'd shock stayed way long, damned I'll ever rent unless absolutely to. plague still exists today:

Here's FAQ sheet California big-time pague issues Francisco plague 1900–1904 Actually tested positive antibodies first time (never PCR), know serology test pretty high false positive rate. understand doctors consider also isolated home fought virus, never spend time hospital. fighting virus, tested positive COVID-19 antibodies donated plasma hopes helping others 7 day-rolling average US looking jump \~2000 new cases 2 days last two days.

When rolling average 11000 peak, that's bad sign. week shaping nightmare. Maybe check graph. even says Cumulated deaths. Norway’s doesn’t go down. However new cases graph cumulative Norway goes down. understand? think “Free Speech” translates “Free whatever want.” That's also dumb argument. There's reason real estate different costs. Would live near beach Santa Monica Venice $2400 month? Even $550 get live OK, AR, much midwest/south. look stats. 

1.4 million year die motor vehicle accidents.

Pro RATA time year works 758,333. Covid-19 count at? 400 something thousand?

Plus consider living days stolen victim. average age Covid-19 victim 78-81. Motor vehicle accidents steal orders magnitude life victims. numbers done even begin compare.

I don’t think nothing happening. new threat need learn mitigate risks reasonably like cars. Use seatbelt, use mask. Follow traffic lights, keep safe distance. Maintain car, take care immune system. Don’t speed, maintain physical distance, etc....but shutting down? way risks averted outweigh downsides shutting down. Good. time open /s Everyone's saying ""my rent low"" splitting $1500 townhouse three ways shitty town trying push working class people. That’s pretty high. studio apartment $915 350 square feet. lol nothing cuomo done paid off, NYC worst outbreak outside Guayas Bergamo Yeah, refinanced well. good time. still working is. course blame economy. MASSIVE protests full people close proximity without masks. No, stationary store Main St, USA this! Go Planet! Put gravestone, son. I’m sick seeing “too soon”. Based what? lockdown delay things. can’t lock forever vaccine end year joke. wait? Phased reopening slow enough is. Stop hating people reopening. Stay inside want stop shaming people wanting feel like human again. high risk group? living someone high risk group? live without income? can’t get unemployment quit, gotta weigh risks. logarithmic chart used high values obscure differences majority data. linear graph used highlight growth.  supposed help situation right now? That’s going change tomorrow. talk bunch empty residences expensive rental cities making claim use taken internally. back good thing. provided history medicinal use silver 11 years back something show dangerous.

Obviously, neither indicate taking internally ""help body immune system.""

And want prove negative? want process anyone claim taking *whatever* beneficial.. skeptics prove harmful minimum, nothing? That's ridiculous.

Your suggestion based science medical research; faith. unless got information taking silver internally does, manner studying showing impact measurable health outcome even silver used biology (and know use), snake oil salesman here. Arizona Imagine richest, powerful country earth, simple little virus completely stumped like nothing before. “We know decline cases choices half states experiencing increase COVID-19 cases reopening begins,” Gov. Wolf said.""


“Many states experiencing significant case increases tied reopening soon much. Pennsylvania not. remained focused balancing economic interests public health.”


Probably best quote sums reopening efforts:
“We recognize either/or situation. shouldn’t don’t choose health health economy. There’s middle ground allows us open businesses cutting spread COVID-19,” says. effects shape messages sides issue. makes damn near impossible anyone find state’s 1,600 available ICU beds, Tuesday morning, 268 available, lowest since COVID-19 crisis began.

When see statements like either side wonder things like:

 * many beds used covid? even fewer available covid? omit information starting since covid crisis began.

 * many beds taken covid changed past months?

Without knowing two things statement really say much me. away subreddit month. 
Are still discussing Masks work ? still consider self-quarantining 14 days despite negative result. Many false negatives. Tommy Bahamas started making masks reopening. could helped spread made killing. That’s honestly we’re seeing right now. Hot zones back breakout first happened states northeast, that’s shifting states south. worst part governors seem jack shit stop it, practically begging exponential growth 3,600 new cases today say California, Texas, Florida new hot zones. surprised. current apartment’s management company raising rent year, although really matter moving fall. sorry insensitive grandmother.

China imports lot food well, 105b worth, largely brazil. imports suddenly dry up, there's supply chain issues, cause problem pretty quickly. source postponing tests tweo weeks? d****** believe number reporting Yeah, 100,000 people died. sweat. Wow, almost like even without government intervention, people still try avoid getting sick. /s Freedom isnt unconditional making law protect public isnt unconstitutional. Luckily, everyone mild symptoms seem okay best brightest countries fully embraced neoliberalism study commerce law professions highest rewards, even brilliant mathematicians end working finance calculating profit margins ever decreasing fractions dollar.
The political elites simply reflect society whole, lawyers, financiers, bankers speculators rise top.
These countries anti science design choice, US one country Australia. Rural area, small town currently long governor overrides law wonder?  last prednisone burst (stepping 5 mg every 3 days 60) cost something like $5 insurance $0.62 it. Compared Symbicort ($1288 three month supply without insurance, $50 with) it’s I’d consider expensive. Might well force people wear condoms sex. That’s China’s view, it’s world’s view including Americans. control like area country since may.  People stoped careing.....no Spike hospitalization Big Brain Moment: won‘t second wave, first one never ends. right. need healthy people healthy economy. people forget inverse also need healthy economy healthy people.

But mitigate spread without shutting down. Plenty places open long time still seen cases continue drop. state Georgia, Denmark, South Korea Beijing going panic buying mode. Ah know, correct. forgot face touching gasping breath. tricky time live. I've heard people picking Covid-19 Amazon boxes lock down. perfect answer masks great tool. lot low-paid labor? issues existed pandemic true. flared recent past? much momentum? 

Could tens millions people unemployed right now? mass uncertainty direction leadership country?

Why unemployed? mass uncertainty? current event could cause old issues, might say might existed america began country, inflamed right now?

I would willing bet covid-19 answer lot questions. normal person cant breathe mask on. imagine wearing mask wearing glasses. test positive develop serious symptoms test positive develop symptoms could still spread virus though people mild symptoms almost certainly spread virus less people get seriously ill. Look NZ Labour numbers. three-way coalition government even largest party Parliament. Question September election whether outnumber anyone else two-to-one three-to-one. Gathering outside (or even without) masks way different inside getting drunk crowded bar. bad idea, one objectively dangerous. Chinese people way paranoid it. that’s good thing. Even Austria here, chinese (or Asian) people wear masks everywhere. Even though trend going wearing mask since lot restrictions lifted. asian restaurant visited, everyone employees wore mask even though required law anymore. People relaxing, going out, daily cases 10-30 right now. chinese know still afraid second wave overly cautious. imagine chinese Asian people general way cautious Asia too. 

It sad see many people USA denial. wish people could finally wake work together contain situation. Good Beijing residents flights cancelled next 15 days. Oh right anyone protesting bad. know think party goers Protesting lockdown . it’s okay obviously protesting holy act immune Covid /s China must pay none. It’s bullshit person knows business doesn’t want bothered calling out. I'm also seeing data suggests numbers overreported (i.e. dying \*with\* corona vs dying \*of\* corona). somewhere summarises data hypothesis? hard find dispassionate analysis todays environment. believe joke think lot reports spread fecal contamination even though test find feces I'm sure there's proof little bit tiny particles flushing much actual probability infect people.

We read major outbreaks like waste treatment plants anything guess harder transfer feces sounds. tall guy, sides umbrellas often poke face. bet Planned Parenthood never told going sell data either they? always bugs company group never even bothers include little ""we may share information...."" line signup page... course BS use word ""may"" ""share"" truth sell information provide anyone willing pay it. pandemic terrible.

I live decent size city south Washington DC everywhere go funeral procession, candlelight vigil ambulance taking away another body morgue.

The stores half empty, much staff dead dying customers seen months.

My job ghost town, many positions vacant ravages virus.

You buy real estate cheaply entire families wiped out.

Honestly though, Internet, could never guess pandemic. video have:

1. Dr. Campbell, nurse nurse teacher another video day showed research Sweden. PhD teaching understand it.
2. Dr. Jon Tallinger, general practitioner, aka specialist geriatric care. Googling name mainly returns blogs fringe news websites.

This inform sceptical claims.


Now, Swedes following news heard controversy. several heartrending stories mainstream media relatives feel enough done parents left die.

As probably know, treat patient always easy assessment. Especially comes end life care weigh potential suffering treatment cause chance longer life. discussion unique covid-19 epidemic. 
The stories mainstream media caused relatives push treatment Swedish doctors err side caution, sending elderly hospitals treatment. turn led hospitals cautioning lead suffering often dignified care given.

Article Swedish doctors send elderly intensive care, may lead unnecessary suffering: note absolutely know Dr. Campbell Dr. Tallinger. However, claim judged light areas expertise. Mask, Service must exceptions though - one friends went China days ago currently quarantine. tell get new visa, despite already (non-expired) 10 year China visa passport. wear mask Australia noticed rare see another mask, maybe 1 100 wearing one, lucky numbers low. Masks look cool dystopian I'm taking excuse wear one haha. Well figure out. everyone board controlling it, yeah. gonna fuck us hard. its* era mean even see employees way, requiring wear mask decrease productivity decreases due bunch getting sick. China... Sure, pretty much every first world country would entirely free everyone. Even covid-19. Yeah definitely wouldn’t believe that, think there’s something say wearing mask long periods time. girlfriend went back work, complains every day gets home end day feels light headed. masks make pretty good seal, doesn’t opportunity take day. Deal Göttingen case. 

Obviously, numbers glossed necessary tests simply postponed two weeks order exceed 50 cases/100k inhabitants. 

The downvotes comment show nicely well tactic works. already influx Californians coming second home staying lockdown order... 

Which would fine *if* stayed inside. white people arrogant care others probably primarily washing hands giving porta potty enough time air uses.

I porta pottt less risk indoor public bathroom cases wash hands ventilated one person time. downside course running water come hand sanitizer dispenser hand sanitizer. Yeah you’re absolutely bang on

We scared, shouldn’t.

Scare enough keep distance don’t scare much won’t go businesses

It’s knife edge



However I’ve said since beginning

China ain’t fucking around. 
There reason that, it’s dangerous enough shut economy like still it. try gas-lighting people. read WSJ (just news usually) ""Opinion"" section Mr. President twitter. read think Pandemic long gone Beijing massive test way overreacting unnecessary. Luckily live sane country learned enough know White House claim BS. Hi everyone!

I started running group (20 people).

I wondering risks comes corona? group worried, questions..

I mean, keep 2meter distance, clearly smell people (sweat, parfum etc..) mean get infected corona?

How work? protests - uggghhhh un.fucking.real. fear - fear protest spreaders.

It's three weeks cases still going down, NY Minnesota  Wearing masks stores still mandatory country. store go shopping gives pair gloves entrance touch products fresh gloves, end give money/card get rid gloves exiting store. think easy effective.
But even best efforts touching phones shopping even put masks chins talk phone shopping. Humans weird. regular European style conservatives. Christian suits (usually minority rights, especially lgbtq). three weeks since massive protests; really factor anything middle pandemic.....

Honestly protesters aren’t. Getting reason shut anything down. Masks appear work let’s open get people working again. doesn’t sound like physician. We’re certainly done it. fucking insane.  Probably cast votes. Trump care wether people lives long gets votes. Imagine surprise see post history full coronavirus/mask skepticism. 'seriously' mean? serious merciless virus? sure not, human ability accomplish that. thing done minimizing amount infections degree. long every human country continously tested *and* borders completely closed, infection numbers guessing game, simply possible, even technically. would need perfect police state accomplish that.

New Zealand may done decent job keeping infection rates lower compared countries, that's it. always cases people slipping quarantine ignoring rules, infected infect people. mean, come on, believing really bring infections zero rules like believing able program copy protection never broken. make sense. Hospitalization rate age 18-49 2.5% according CDC website. I’m overweight don’t health issue. low risk needing hospitalization get cocos. Im worried it. still wear mask wash hands, dude 50s beer belly strolling store without mask touching face mystery me. Protestors wear masks surf. Instructions clear one eye closed open I've thought too. can't say would surprise me. Nothing unethical them. keep saying primary problem America psychological. Everything stems poorly trained minds. flat earth, virus denial, climate change denial, like, shows badly need stop mind-warping people. can't imagine agendas begin denial movements. thought patterns horribly constructed, destructive effect. would flattening infections reducing. I’m sore throat issue ran fever week ago. doc gave zpack seemed help initially throat hurts again. tested yesterday. Hopefully I’ll know whether covid days. not, idea I’m still sick. need help Technically cCDu
 party power Germany since 2005. really platform, old name... Yes, like much else administration, Trump incapable actually using things fullest advantage.

He could massively reduced immigration ""s-hole countries"" without blocked

He could funneled money American manufacturing isolationist policy reduce need international travel trade.

He could replaced Obamacare something else like promised using need treating testing covid-19 reason. 

He could implemented careful strategic lockdowns emphasis redeploying people tracking/tracing roles monitor outbreaks. 

The problem, always, trump simply quite stupid. That's insult per se, fact. take rocket scientist figure good stuff global emergency would guaranteed re-election, apparently see early enough actually act time. result he's basically going get re-elected cheats. Oh he's definitely going cheat, less dense, to. 

You couple genuine stupidity lack empathy GOP + Trump get current situation US. Cruelty point. carry insect sprayer bottle bleach spray outhouse every morning there's many people site leave.

I think main problem construction sites majority workers taking threat seriously course person running build sites responsibility keep workers safe possible, mostly bother do. You’re making lot loose assumptions order make really stupid point. Win-win. Thanks, indeed insightful remarks. good look critically data set, real life numbers random controlled experiments imperfect dataset. risk always look much data fits narrative prefer. 

I seen recent R0 number estimates per state, seems least states climbed somewhat 1. USA whole unfortunately gotten low EU countries gotten that. means reopening USA carries risk pushing R0 1 state.

So bugger public R0 numbers per state makes really good assess level restrictions best fitted state time.

Oh wait serious this?

Let laugh even harder!

BAHAHAHAHAHA want take offense comment, really describe south Florida. said essentially useless that’s contagious virus is. trust Sweden all. /u/Thezenstalker mentions. Europe, we've waited numbers people ER really, really low reopening stuff. US, far tell, states applying policies Europe, numbers people ER still climbing many states.

Also, personally feeling that, despite many errors, Europe least attempted handle matter seriously (even UK). definitely quacks, Presidents/Prime Ministers acknowledged problems, moved address generally succeeded. far tell afar, that's opposite happened US.

The personal parallel make Covid-19 Spanish Flu Hong Kong Flu. latter two, Europe ignored censored threat suffered lot it, US certainly made mistakes nevertheless took threat seriously attempted save citizens. time, seems situation opposite.

Also, let's face it, reading latest news Donald Trump saying good laugh expense become tradition across Europe since 2016. healthy, human: looking series errors made US makes us feel better matter poorly fared, richest country world best fare infinitely worse. centrist party left right leaning wings. extremist conservatives though, US perspective, would left democrats. Also, Jesus sit decision-making table all. That’s it’s true. good thing Harvard expert tell us this, otherwise would know? doesn’t give crap virus here. one's video, good depiction silent protest Seattle. Look masks: Might want double check dashboard, sweets. countries stopped testing testing little suddenly problem

Many us went much further, taking social media castigate others insufficient social distancing neglecting wear masks daring believe could maintain semblance normal life coronavirus. end April, state Georgia moved end lockdown, Atlantic ran article headline “Georgia’s Experiment Human Sacrifice”. Two weeks ago shamed people street; today shame street First all, video absolute joke don’t understand anyone take seriously.

Second all, herd immunity never strategy, that’s tabloid journalists understanding epidemiology whatsoever interpret as.

Lastly, reason people support strategy it’s explained throughly. half-ass interpreted journalist, people responsible, it’s based primarily 3 things:

1: Lockdowns unconstitutional Sweden, scenario war. don’t “Emergency powers.” Changing constitution requires election between.

2: Vaccines take years develop

3: Eradication without vaccine near impossible. look suddenly popped Peking again.

There course discussions whether strategy right not, yet read single international article manages even cover “why” accurately. get is, guys come obvious comments but... think people actually believe saying? Illinois pretty strict shut down, see decreases cases deaths 4 weeks. pretty miserable Arkansas weird place, politically. went solid blue solid red course like... three elections. never purple period like states shift.

Look political statement...Automod absolute worst mods programmed beyond ashamed  still *have* go work. stay sick leave wish so. like anyone forced going back work sick. mean, yeah, he’s 72. doesn’t want die. much yes. Smart man that's leadership. Still enough taken serious USA. cases rising, need DEATHS rising taken serious. Cases mean anything states people. donor isn’t people think is. they’re full HLA match (which hard find) living donor (also rare, usually family members) you’re usually looking 10-15 years organ rejection. cadaver around 5 years you’re lucky, sometimes more, sometimes less. first organ gets rejected it’s massively harder get second donor organ last time without rejection. thing organ donations need suppress immune system take means things like cancer far likely take hold, mention getting sick bigger deal depending type disease. 

On end father turned full HLA match kidney gave us 4 great quality years wouldn’t mother otherwise, ended getting cancer dying one year diagnosis. Kidneys can’t recover damage like organs it’s one way trip degradation sadly, really hope he’s able maintain quality life this. Coid-19 : Hold beer, halftime. Whack, I've seen opposite sentiment generally, Illinois good masks stricter states (and numbers back up). area big, like Lake McHenry county doubt lol. Genius! good point. 
Here’s poor mans gold 🔔🔔🔔 [According even Hong Kong feels way. Taiwan South Korea feel US slightest bit better China, Japan think USA significantly better job China. 

I found hilarious 87% Nigerians think we're rocking covid response even though thought China good job, really shows terrible media keeping people informed. Simple really, opened everything. Florida phased plan nothing enforced bars restaurants ignored it. 

Locals flocked beaches parks phase 1 criticized results still positive outdoor transmission especially beach consistent breeze minimal. 

Then opened indoor areas course Floridian tell gets hot people outdoors tourists (away beaches). Cases begin rise.  officials tracing 320 people regarded “close contacts” women, urged get tested. Close contacts could include passengers flight New Zealand quarantined travellers Auckland hotel, well hotel staff flight crew. women isolation relative, officials said.

They, apparently, didn’t contact anyone quarantine. I’m sceptical, it’s though taking public buses.

Still, situation fucks off. *one* fail point: border. need quarantine anyone comes couple weeks, isolate anyone dealing them. media sounding alarm, media reporting experts predicting? 

Last person would trust VP experience simultaneously believes pray virus away OP like Trump’s pandemic IIRC studies looking contracting virus wearer spreading it. many podcasts could easily wrong. basically China's version Wuhan lab leak. Theoretically possible fuel conspiracies, highly unlikely. Heuristics simply good bases logical reasoning, especially instances available information limited. Hmmm
Play dumb games, win dumb prices.
Since they're sensitive, word down. Uhm, sanitize themselves, virus begins die outside human host. talking bacteria, would much bigger problem. cope much better outside human body. Virus kind fish dry land outside human body. Also, uneven surface gloves makes even harder virus survive. Yes, gloves somewhat ""auto-sanitizing"". That's fine dumbass wrong Murphy's Law. 

She went anytihng could go wrong... went wrong. 

How Murphy's Law? prison. Nobody cares get virus. Nice try.

I understand minor infraction, rest... are, like literally every time see comments, wrong.

Nope... graph tells commenting resume learn post truthful information.

LOL, breakdown cases detected sweden:

Where from? take data directly Public Health Agency let's is, almost exactly growth rates so-called ""flattened curve"".

As ""severe"" ""mild"" cases... exactly counting mild cases even testing people unless ""seriously ill"" part ""at risk"" made change following first signs community infection (cases could linked overseas travel previously confirmed cases).  meant contact tracing would longer effective, since cases accounted for, order best prioritise resources, Public Health Agency shifted resources focus seriously ill risk monitor prevalence COVID-19 people mild symptoms asked stay home, **mainly patients severe symptoms tested admitted truth simply counting cases lead ""flattened curve"" obvious chart based data Public Health Agency... even need look case data, cause [death/hospitalization/intensive care show kind flattening purple line.

Sorry... numbers worthless know many people would need intensive care simply denied it.

Hell, even investigation people denied treatment, even apparently plenty beds sorry trust Intensive Care numbers accurate representation spread disease Sweden. people denied treatment reason age, aged likely need treatment, numbers actually receive mean refrain posting learned basic high school data analysis

LOL... got owned graph Swedish media articles. wonder prefer comment bullshit. Last week funeral grandfather, died coronavirus, partner people 30 wearing mask. 

some even asked suspiciously felt like needed wear mask around them, like personal slight. Idk, traveled different parts country pandemic say goodbye someone died said pandemic, can’t minimum prevent spread? yeah, hope us. 7 answered (not sure) Looks cool, long foes battery last. sell games fans. position global stage ends weaken point cannot take current roles anymore

Trust US basically none across globe army preparing second Cause they're bunch fake macho men wearing mask would sign weakness. F trump ilk. Foxnews too. Cancer country. Bill who? who's fault it? people blame media, blame system.

I blame people designed quarantine rules incompetent. 

The rules obvious sieve.

You also must know airline crew asked self isolate, exempt isolation rule returning NZ. Also tested.

Won't surprise much find new community transmission weeks come, back go level 4 lockdown ! mean, I'm overweight according BMI. I'm size 4 19"" calves muscle. I'm nowhere near body builder. bad outdated formula taken seriously. Ca. states mixing awhile sure anybody anymore. Many asian countries hear done well versus virus IMO difference culture. Asian culture values health greatly almost fault. There's greater culture cooperation. western countries, US probably biggest offender. Nobody gives shit person next them.

This virus going wreck us when/if vaccine available. fear future may hold fact vaccine possible. sway opinion formed.

Are talking yourself? laugh everytime top comment Beijing outbreak US.

Keep good fight, wumaos. heard cut they're paying guys. “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.” - George Carlin the, I'm living fear crowd! Wait where's gun? claim really agree polls though. Yep, liberal jack-offs Um.....No  take longer 2 minutes teach someone wear remove respirator. difficult! I'm seconding rec watch Rhonda Patrick episode, talks sulforaphane potent anti inflammatory I've taking since start this. Pornhub. dumbfounded would say that. know 2 months old, spot on. hit 100k dead April 9th. forms human-run government inefficient corrupt nature cannot manage large-scale decisions. need robocracy ASAP. guys hiring? 😂 BMI joke take anyone uses seriously. conspiracy hypothesis? think world leader getting prophylactic antibody treatment since Boris Johnson almost died? way governors handling things. least apartments I've seen individual HVAC units. that's case fine. shared unit maybe still seems unlikely since air return neighbor's apartment either. wife? throw coming from? end 😫 Worldometer 37k now. test something 10 months know there's long term side effect typically develops year.

Because case 'Oxford' vaccine entered human trials around 2 years ago effects would likely known now: 'Oxford' vaccine originally targeted MERS developed target COVID19 similar fashion flu vaccines shuffled strains, alone many vaccines similar stories. “And future wave far far smaller, guarantee...”  predict US price soar Narrator: China wrong 8 10 ass. Closer 1 10 going masks social distancing see. instead asking sources guy made false claim, ask person called provide sources? Exactly what's wrong country. propaganda sub fucking hilarious Wow. perspective, entire country Canada (population 39 million) saw 326 new cases. sure follow virus activated towers guess price steroids double next days. Well great, let's hope becomes public norm distant future. They're probably tested regularly. That's sufficient drop spread within staff. Masks would help, we're talking preventing handful community transmissions office instead primary control mechanism. thinking today, death count could 100k 5 million matter long die. always going ""why even take preventative measured, die anyways"" Lots people disagree 'locked better' would open now. constantly moving goalposts. Life short, die eventually. Enjoy can. Gonna happen Idaho too. Widespread View ~~China~~ *the world (including U.S)* U.S. Pandemic Control

There, fixed headline. ehhh...exponential math exponential math everywhere. prevent spread, spreads exponentially. happened ready die stonks? 75+ year olds heart attack, diabetes multiple severe comorbidities, exact... Riiiiight, like one's ever criticized white women before... I'm glad company taking super seriously. putting occupancy limits conference rooms, installing desk cough barriers, making distributing masks, taking everyone's temperature, still encouraging remote work wherever possible. heartening see especially since 2 month old wife home immunocompromised. It’s weird it’s always white people stories, black lives matter protesters never happen right, somehow jumbled information head. thanks that. least one country :) say go back normal? said let won’t affected go back “normal” vulnerable shield. Right trying blanket cover majority population select few. Focus attention funding protecting vulnerable, that’s it. 

Well medical doctors driving force easing lockdown. makes think know medical doctors warrant shutting back again? also healthier ages except elderly, despite obesity. vitamin deficiencies (aside vitamin D).

I also severely doubt we're going stop spread COVID-19. However, think states might well overall actually prevent deaths (NY, MA, NJ, PA, IL), initial epidemiologic projections also way off, probably see 2.2 million deaths thing takes Fall. little light could thing cured elephant room. Oregon mandatory mask thing venturing stores? I'm Illinois (Chicago) cannot enter store without one. burbs way. Outside bit different story, like 75% people see masks on. HA shit point let whatever happens happen. Since people don’t care anyway, let’s let play out. get lot worse lot places (think like NY everywhere) people take seriously. healthcare point Knoxville surrounding areas (save maybe gatlinburg/pigeon forge) aren’t densely populated like metropolitan cities listed are. gradual increase best case scenario virus, since containment feels improbable (people don’t want wear masks contact trace). I’m small town outside Knoxville mom/grandparents telling nightmare none friends think it’s serious. mean 240 taxes? term limit Governor. Rumor may try run President, that's campaign expect would go nowhere. Anything Agent Orange didn’t touch. You’d think us healthcare would smarter that, nope scarily large amount people still thought/thinks ok. Americans idiots they’re pure evil care $  doubt happen. 16 cnn earlier leading epidemiologists, actually understand viruses better rest us, saying going second wave similar Spanish flu? Maybe mutated strain, things definitely going get worse get better. person replied seem facts straight. Man strange see obviously rational argument upvoted. 3 months ago arguing doctors online I'll fitting mask better nothing refused agree. I'm quoting numbers exist. said ""the true rate unknown"" solution everything fine let's go life normal? I've stayed pretty consistent line general medical consensus please tell much better informed doctor working NYC returns, Covid sales final attitude virus world ender FAR worse Oregon? I'm seeing plenty wearing masks Portland. Take look back exchange. don’t disagree it’s growing polite. Peace. race careless state. no. America: ""wait turn!"" facial recognition software can't determine wearing mask. Aaaand unless medical grade N95 reduce infection rates like 85% eliminate them. done Boston early too. Seems like great tool. Especially feel ok this. shame america running kind camps learned bad idea generations ago. Yessss it’s written give away. Hint: cause place AC long hours impossible avoid exposure people usually place work. stinks. two popular NZ right now... pop virus microwave over? fucking embarrassment. death *rate*... basically guy Bolsonaro? Quite hilarious judge chinese people online trolling. Chinese people plenty critical stuff say government. understand Chinese, go weibo see tons them... Can’t blame uneducated voters I’d Ignore fearmongering stats clearly show ain’t gonna happen. You’re another chicken little. 

Also hospitals overrun. fact hospitals mostly empty. laid nurses. .... except Hong Kong Taiwan.

Politics reality. breaking records... NBD tons nurses even doctors brushed well, unfortunately. Vegas needs one two coronavirus horror stories people scared come back However, would also isolate everyone interacts age group, since caretakers younger.

If caretakers children, can't isolate kids vector via schools daycares.

It's simple. Yup pay 1600 200sqft closet.

The benefits 5 min walk gym, 10 min bike ride work drain due COVID... least grocery trips still short :’) What's ""Medical Bill""? American's call plastic card get born, bring doctor whenever sick? number go hospital want. let's look previous medical procedures, know allergic something need give current medications stay. 

Does card cover first $1 million like car insurance? guess hospital years use up.

I've heart surgery, two cancer surgeries, 30 rounds radiation, tonsils kid, would put $1 million? Thanks, knew soon I’ve hearing people street online talking next plans. love kind people, lose minds average joe getting extra dollars even blink fed spends trillions bailing banks buying mountains stocks companies currently furloughing employees. distinctly remember seeing video months ago Arnold Schwarzenegger calling people weak wearing masks staying home super ultra conservative whole thing, tried find video proof reference, changed gears dramatically video saw months ago drowning sea ""Arnold Schwarzenegger PSA: social distance wear masks"" sorta articles.

Good Arnie, regained respect 👌🏼 Stay move somewhere remote. Tech people remote jobs moving Portland pricing locals houses forcing move elsewhere. Floridian here. Let know works NYC... landlords don’t want find new tenants environment, lot leverage realize. 

Unless landlord bite nose spite face* would fully recovered person need sent nursing home? disagree things won’t hate you. Thank doubling down. I’m sure feel this. Nursing homes go die. allow pre-approved diseases kill people avoid “disgrace” label? it’s covid forgetting swallow 5 years Alzheimer’s, give covid day long. I’m 30 minutes Palm Springs nearly everyone wears masks grocery store, post office etc. 

We’ve also barely hit covid. 33 deaths city covid 31 nursing homes. 

We also streets full protesters last two weeks. doesn’t lead surge positives nothing will. meant agency supposed enforce KN95 standard failed. may over, KN95 label could trustworthy again. But, I'd always worry crisis we'll swamped substandard masks. [Reminds born raised bible belt tell religion cult. kind.

It obvious infected senior, try keep far away healthy person possible.

Not prevent sick seniors removed homes, sent sick seniors *into* homes prepared deal them.

And case think ""Well best could do"", llets remember government used tax money build brand new field hospitals quarantine capabilities *that remained unused* Covid situation developing nursing homes.

Somebody really needs charged. criminal negligence resulted death.

Not *only* that, death numbers generated *policy failure* used reason economy needed shut down.

Hey government, want death numbers decrease, stop killing seniors policies?

In Canada 82% deaths nursing homes. ridiculous. people could medical conditions like itchy nose

You're basically saying *fuck you* people medical conditions preclude something. LITERAL definition ableist! reason disgraceful highest deaths per capita world. Damn young people! make government open restaurants! Drives back smashing glass suggestive title given content article. Using tests argument Gupta clearly states test unreliable immunity coronaviruses also help one show up. mere fact mayors must grovel beg Governor get permission protect towns cities covid 19 tells damn F'ed country truly is! hugely expensive keep someone nursing home, way business model works something like 80% residents Medicaid rather using money. Nursing homes tight budgets thin profit margins, even thinner medicaid they're actually taking loss. bad place general. Medicaid course could improve things paying more, massive deficit medicaid spending is. ~~More likely~~ Certainly medicaid payments going future rather up. make much difference nursing homes profit nonprofit conditions. Government biggest customer nursing homes even government spending afford them. edit like 45% Medicaid 15% medicare. They’ll meet people refer Jesus soon. No, shit! Central FL.

I've lived 5 states never experience! Disney still scheduled reopen? Unsurprising expected, sad, yes. Faith weak. Don’t faith, confidence. America killed million people foreign countries 3K people died 9/11. 

115K people died COVID people can’t bother wear mask. Oh wow! that's real intelligent argument.... yea doubling 6 years sounds insane. want know answer too. NYC, anyway. Normal increase like every fucking year. Many admit it, people started saying okay go streets 'you know' especially epidemiologists, also gave implied permission many social media go outside whatever reason feel important, let certain state governors hook responsibility virus spread many peoples eyes.

It seems acclimation period fear past. complaining enough people dying? I’m Michigan last checked something like 22% unemployment. 
I bet see pretty serious increase next couple months homes market. 
As current owner, sucks.  
As someone looking upgrade, great.  
The question whether rent sell current home. Cities overpriced get return. ""office culture"" BS touted tech illiterate sales/marketing types pushed obscene prices. fact modern non-essential jobs done remotely pulled lid fact city living rated, vastly priced.

Source: developer used commute NYC Yeah that's massive fraud, OP report IRS can't even enjoy town's FB used hilarious bitching stuff like McDonalds messing someone's order repeatedly (and keep going back!) older anti-mask people gone insane. 

Once someone posted complaining restaurant crowded kitchen masks got takeout..and EVERYONE commented person stay home wanted go now.  one. Sounds like loser sob story. try hard enough SATs woe me. Gib stuff. get need based assistance go school. loans. schools might've picked basis poor even scored well.

Then could've gone community college quite cheaply gotten two year degree cut college costs half even 4ths take exams uni credits thus skipping entire courses. 

Or could've studied community college upskilled well paying trade makes Bachelors Arts holders. people need English major everyone needs working toilet,

Welding 34K-56k US investment 4k.
Plumbing 39K-69K Master plumber 44K-88K.

There ways go college, ways make money. UBI never happen. completely disagree Mitch McConnel, sleep easy knowing hes watch prevent UBI happening. tbf, perhaps state local leadership could tad science-friendly comes making coronavirus-related health business decisions, too. tumor! think diplomatic immunity. sure Thank you! After-School All-Stars charity founded serves 100,000 kids 13 states comprehensive after-school programs. pandemic they’ve zoom programs feeding families serve. also get we’ll back mask I’m selling 100% profit goes them. Wait see Tulsa's airport numbers weeks ask reasonable accommodation ADA? Never considered pandemic

Gates others talking risk years (decades?). Maybe I'm closer it. know bunch epidemiologists. would suggest that? You’re ruining narrative! think number children also factor though, western culture average number probably 2 so, people often children much later. starting find footing career maybe family I'll probably early mid thirties mom 70. Hopefully she'll good health reasonably likely able care financially physically point.

Still I've seen happens homes personally really hope end one. brother already agreed best mean we'll magically financially advantaged situation would like be. grow money know might limitations Texas - everything bigger here. Including upcoming COVID numbers. Despite fact we're super spread out. worry still competitive.

Florida - r/FloridaMan 

Arizona - There's way kind spread, heat kill virus. Oops forgot almost summer everyone indoors ... never said strategy (still herd immunity, earth flat either) worked. 

And bringing South Korea? even guy responded to? TIL homeless bad thing.

Seriously, color sky are?

Edited add: areas common practice, can't find apartment months searching. ""good"" apartment, ""reasonably priced"" apartment. Literally *any* apartment. Super niave think universal hole Airbnb ""few days"" screwed landlord. maybe like riding motorcycle without helmet. people really like it, they're confident enough abilities believe they'll likely finish trip without incident. lose control, they'll safe way like they've envisioned.

we do/think stupid things justify stupid things want do. make us overall stupid. means stupid instance Wait, get news MSN? Yeah, strangest thing. actually saw counter argument argues 10th amendment, states constitutional right enact many measures protect public things like spread disease. I'm kind surprised lawmakers countering ""but ma' rights!"" bunch explanation powers given states Constitution. 

Bottom line, I'm still disbelief society finding ways bicker rather simple things keep people safe. kind correct, we’re still first wave Depends are. Northeast Midwest mostly grip it, South...it's mile Yes, 2nd wave complete death cultivated pits hell. exactly right 2nd wave. getting better treatment everyday see hear that. death rate going this. people ever crack code we've ever had. course, perfect still make mistakes people die this. Still, much advanced technology medical advances forget normal us. forget things people died back nowadays nothing. opened state back up, people stopped wearing masks. give shit anymore. Wish canada would stop BS monthly extension. Come clean tell America fuck next year like Australia. I’m following rules I’m telling anyone ignore rules. think it’s everyone’s best interest follow law. think don’t make ton sense. I’m wearing masks indoors public. don’t understand wearing mask outside almost one around. Herd immunity means lot people need get it, lot might die. enough research know clearly would work covid decide use method. seems thinking writing much rationally coherently are, calling stupid. don’t know point responding don’t better things say instead bashing everyone disagree think mileage may vary. proof 2 assholes spoil things everyone really shitty testing long time,so impacts stats. I'd say Austin hot spot call whole state hot. Fine. Even precautions would bet every penny players coming covid.

Wait see. Arizonan, attest testing started ramp past month so. AZ 50th testing one point, think really know extent well. Perhaps NY levels, almost exclusively community spread point little attempt contact tracing.

People acting like nothing going here. feel absolutely insane stayed home 3 months feels like everyone else nothing stop spread. Even masks treated like something mocked many. dead cat certainly would increasing sales tax revenue. Texas state income tax places closed government losing money. Honestly couldnt worse BLM protests.  housing market regional. buyers market, switched. am, we’re sellers buyers buyers sellers. didn’t drop rate.

I’m also USA banking situation different mortgages work such. think bank deferments. I’m sure. It’s hard say long last since it’s less fed thing bank thing.

I’m also bad spot don’t home house fire chooses made covid even called covid. I’m stuck apartment waiting get house. I’ll likely pay sort premium easy wait out. One hour exposed air shared infected person gives sufficient viral load infection. five minutes person singing. rough numbers fr studies.

Offices fucked. gave pipe dream, shit keeps getting expensive Th frat boys piss reason. Hahahaha This. iirc roughly 70% states cases workplaces Ok good luck That’s issue. It’s everyone leadership take seriously. blame one group group led opening campaign seems ridiculous. likely, able come need 14 day hotel isolation. hotel guarded police can't leave 14 days get tested Allowed leave. 


At point australian government paying returning citizens international student. think australian government pay give bill pay 14 day hotel quarantine stay. 


Just letting know country appointed state experts cannot even produce one serological study randomized, representative sample. facemasks silly nonsense apparently geez I'm getting tired. see people post comment time always assume education system failed teaching history Citizen's United America's worst mistake ever. Yeah, lot people attitude unfortunately. Things getting worse day, still people act though everything normal. 
I've keeping family home since middle March, frustrating staying home (3 kids, age 7 under) there's way ignore situation. seems end sight here. know maybe 2 3 people seem taking seriously, even social distancing stay home order, soon things opened rushed back restaurants, salons etc. 
Our neighbors big party next week invited us. whole thing crazy, people simply care. Yep, even time published changed. I'm sure best response definitely right testing standards, N95's testing directly connected intended use. KN95's find/get like cloth masks create seal, even attempt create seal, pass fit test. know testing standard pass standard pass fit test seal users face pretty bad standard regardless filtration ability material.

But material made seams like would filter. considered tested 3d printed masks cutting KN95's use filtration medium. worked passed fit test, comfortable one wanted that. also flaked created odd dust cut into, made everyone concerned well. one wanted breathing polyester residue material something.  remember months ago sub real cluster people legit shocked much parents fighting safety .

There articles written mom constantly making grocery store trips full fridge pantry .... made sense going outside danger. going weird journalists start using word endemic describe Covid. scope disease's spread infectiousness likely means almost certain become endemic. We're treating like reduce incidence zero, can't. part world able without walling indefinite period time. Sweden merely accepted reality sooner rest Europe. And, since rate new deaths per day falling Sweden many U.S. states despite steady rising new cases, maybe become endemic nearly bad originally assumed! Must easy caring people. enough people dead Americans care.

Sadly succinct. people world starts doorstep. see anyone dying front there's issue. Consider lucky Boy got metaphor impairment issues. Sit relax, maybe get cup tea stop taking thee world serious. He's made decision. economy lives. can't back now. Work too. Jim &amp; Tammy Bakker low-life predators 2 decades now.

Tammy divorced Jim 1992 died cancer 2007. owned mistakes accounts pretty decent person got away Jim. One sons went pastor openly advocating acceptance LGBTQ community starting mid 00s. rarely speaks father again, Jim piece shit.

Sunglasses, hat, hair perfect. skied said, ""beautiful day, huh?"" smiled said ""gorgeous"" perfect Arnold Schwarzenegger accent skied off. form perfect. giddy rest day. It’s double edged sword success — low numbers start means growth dramatic. Tough decision probably best they’re aiming next NZ. unlike New York went complete lockdown get numbers down..... wide open governor refuses enforce anything let alone shutting state again:(. said live it! It’s bad! get point we'll passed total US deaths World War II (405k). I'm hoping get quite far end year, certainly possible.

If gets 620k higher US deaths Civil War, needs get 675k beat 1919 flu pandemic, multiple years, reign supreme everything 40+ year HIV epidemic. increasing evidence masks significantly slow spread. Lockdown bought countries time learn virus increase medical supplies. 



Look counties successful; minimum hoping herd immunity. New Zealand vaccine, they're restriction free, border control. BC, Canada, pretty much everywhere open, though limits building capacity masks everywhere, numbers remain low. lockdown bought us time saved lives. two think first wave never ended. Right, could forget football specifically see numbers proving approach gyms sound? see, every state got set rules 1 month since rules changed areas, less two weeks places like Berlin. honestly think we'd seeing anything significant numbers already? This. reading stories, seen videos. two dudes try get stupid me. one old man. yeah, it’s troubling don’t know I’d became truly physical. worries me. temper... sound like actually read comment, sounds like actually disagree substance either, cool. be. US control degree earned. know, could taken courses received degree. I'm surprised hospital hired her...unless lied degree. understands well (half Chinese) don’t want calling people idiots public.

Half annoys teach wear masks respect people show need do. it’s like every time leave house people demonstrate irresponsible are. first started watching people TV without masks would always call idiots one day started wearing masks like “daddy they’re idiots anymore look”.

IDK Spanish Flu 2.0 goal get thru without great psychological bodily injury. would helpful everyone else could play along. Yeah that's asked thoughts, since clear cut. notice guy quiet month, I'm sure response come. Hopefully die COVID, would height irony. 



In case thanks setting reminder time capsule. think incredible got 100k+ deaths precautions, suspect real second wave around fall/winter real test. thought might get lucky virus might slow fall wishful thinking seeing numbers. states forced shutdown hard soon matter idiots charge saying now. Switch weed, CBD, maybe occasional stimulant, psychedelics (good addiction), therapy deal manic/depressive cycle. problem is/was, lockdown time make plan. Increase testing/tracing compacity. North East seems area listened CDC guidance. knew early going stop virus. needed slow spread science catch it. 

So early cases many states make prime breeding grounds virus especially start reopen. wished someone said something me. I’d definitely put knuckles jaw. Already done before, won’t think twice again. Lol one cares live country morals scruples matter. People numbers. gain lose few, like chess pieces. chemicals make lot money people. people count? guess must be.
 all, billionaire class. working hard destroy planet. Even able live without clean drinking water. way, scientists say viruses like Covid linger heavily polluted air longer. Sooo. viruses may eventually get us all. Arnold heart surgery strict recommendations type exercise diet order make sure heart good shape. seems take health seriously. sure alcohol consumption though. 

He absolutely go indoor place people working out, especially without masks. Keep evolution nonsense here! pure Jesus juice! people went quick. got died next day 2. Suffering, old age. made it, made past car accidents, cancers, diseases, manners early death, die horribly governors protect them. utterly sad makes furious. really feel restaurant owners general right now. It’s easy criticize make jokes they’re greedy willing endanger people make buck pandemic, hell supposed do? government lifting restrictions handouts obviously enough keep afloat course going open try survive. can’t expect people throw away entire life’s work put financial ruin restrictions lifting. barely shutdown better NYs full shutdown without question. Otherwise, would determined reporting appears factual information? Neat strawman, though.  Comparing apples oranges.. Great journalism. guess new motto ""everything clicks"". trend allowed continue multiple states New York level numbers within 6-8 weeks.

Which could totally avoided. Read article swine. Nice. Obviously gonna eradicate virus. Everyone seeing numbers rise coupled everything reopening finding hard believe curve stay flat. worse extremely grave? would correct job worth life health. Stick guns. mean family values conservative, right? roids frontline dope practically every medic pushed since SARS started. 

Now, medics attempting play Chiropractic Physician without license because, functional structural changes work. sanitizer gloves handed tons tons tons volunteers.

Hand sanitizer absolutely NOTHING prevent breathing virus person next screaming yelling hate police. Definitely covid Georgia backdating new cases date 'probable' infection, makes insanely difficult tell what's going on. reason lockdown stay curve. anyone else remember that?

As long able live daily lives (while diligent wearing masks social distancing) without overwhelming health care systems, goal accomplished.

The idea lock entire economy lose jobs rely government feed clothe us. prolong spread virus overload health care systems. COURSE expect rise cases, we’re overwhelming health care systems, GOAL ACCOMPLISHED. read that? 50% tests positive? course possible, would prisoner less one organ live? would 'evil CCP' dispose remains him? feasible.

Yeet dead body hole, delete name ever list say died natural causes.

Every country world disposes dead bodies. Weather nefarious not. visited Allentown weekend. People businesses taking seriously, bit culture shock coming Williamsport. friend didn’t think advance every restaurant booked reservations. decided see could find place Bethlehem. don’t know, Allentown home lot POCs there’s lot poverty.

Bethlehem surreal, turned corner onto one Bethlehem’s main downtown streets sight absolutely absurd. Bougie white people crammed outdoor seating everywhere. Masks rare. saw couple blocks get intersection end street two cops horseback saunter intersection traffic stacked behind them. icing cake absurdity downtown Bethlehem. friend felt really uncomfortable decided return back place attempt go another restaurant Allentown. surreal see juxtaposition two adjacent communities. One wh ite priv ilege one without. Numbers really low compared normal. Stats Brazilian airline travel came yesterday something like 95% domestic, 97% international. zero still people trip might necessary/preferable.

It's case example. caught country origin started, country I've lived last years. There's 3 different legal reasons I'm travelling, would still hop plane tonight could. I'd quarantine amount time, I'd pay high amounts. want risk anyone, also want spend time needed away home nowadays.

So people peculiar circumstances probably account travel still going on. think underestimate number people looking reason travel Florida. Crowds can’t bad everyone sick dying /s *Sign chrisitian jubilee. Write name role. I've changed since lord gifted me. wanna ready. Ready Jesus comes, oh yeah!* Read post. say mass imprisonments. said concentration camps organ harvesting. Sliiiiiiight difference those. needs back jail. Fucking scum. back test samples patients upper respiratory problems. 

This article really lady, talk track cases swab testing symptomatic Reading Ive got IH voice head, like...So many misteries, happen sun night? math related science? universe big, wont fight me? almost like he's purposefully framing black white avoid taking useful action.

There many, many options ""fully opened spreading like wildfire"" ""shutting down"". Unfortunately, seems nuanced approach tailored helping problem bit less fashionable posturing approach designed convey political message. Ok, want believe CNN tells without question, that’s business. close, like pub group 14 friends positive place closed “deep cleaning”, reopen days later. Ha joke Personally, seen hard science whether COVID transmission affected temperature.

But realize ""states hot weather lots COVID"" ""COVID affected hot weather"" correlation, causation, right? shit. Oh voted oblivion saying months ago. 

""Masks arent effective airborne government said masks arent needed know CDC blah blah!"" 

Been saying day 1: airborne, masks work, telling use isnt run precious little bit effective PPE authorities snatch ensure critical staff like hospital workers government officials get them. 

They fucked didnt restock national strategic stockpile scramble intercept available PPE market. Target Twin Cities? ones around even let without mask. question would anyone listen personally? think theory comes people outside warmer weather. However, Arizona’s case, it’s hot people stay inside A/C go indoor activities increasing spread. would actually help cooler since people would outside. Thanks, appreciate that, downvote you. know really shitty thing say food workers shop staff negotiated higher wage think would limited time period we’re could deemed hazard pay?

I think would could quite easily hire people replace people higher wage long term wage increase. Yes, good point. One theory I've heard floated various sources travelers *to* country big danger likely infect people traveling. travelers *from* country go hotspot come back get trouble since likely pass infection friends, family, coworkers, etc. 

I know *quite* buy intellectual level, seems make sense degree. case, pray correct. Britain arguably done better job Yep, I'm waiting blows go gym. then, I'm cardio home. 2 weeks since protests began? agree extent, class warfare factor ever consider. people top see green, much black white. course, pit bottom race division, works well lot American families strong racist backgrounds, taught parent child.

The guys power figured slavery profitable, economically. cynic believes saw end due green.

Only since then, dirt poor people getting knowing people beneath could feel important. went away abolition slavery, left gaping hole lives descending class slavery.

Now open: Rich vs poor.

Except tricked us blaming descendents former slaves reason fallen low ""middle class."" stayed class dirt rich step on. 

I look way: rich leave minority communities behind, ex privileged poor live far communities bat eye. way save much money possible, least anger produced. black white, gold, silver green. exponential growth, new cases doubled rather total number. Still great situation though. new voter suppression tactics must looking impressive 2020. Orlando airport tested 500 people 266 positive. Surprised didn’t see story it’s five days old. Heard nba players discussing point restarting play Orlando. I'd argue comment infinitely useful comments above, try desperately nitpick writer reporting accurate information. nanny state strikes again. here! resigned March didn’t raise rent also got deep clean carpets. read fartville 55 million sheep Yet Trump entourage saying bad China dealing discover much worse US dealt 10 minutes spare time internet connection. truly awful death rate yet one even seems bothered. outrage even comes close 9/11 body count so, much higher price pay economic hit virus? I’m sure you’re stupid sarcastic saying someone health issue implies alive. don’t say person died 10 years ago currently health issues, say they’re dead. muh freedom Pre-order Trump brand Soylent Green NOW! use discount code ‘ur_dead_meat’ Good old Britons seeding plague again. Good one. would NZ allow people coming UK (Worst affected European country) enter NZ good efforts people NZ made put pandemic control?

Good old Britons. Really liked article give hope vaccine. finding Steroid treatment U.K. hopefully see good things horizon. Still going long road hopefully good things come. bit context everyone ex-Beijinger. ""super spreading"" event happened one largest raw ingredients wholesale market Beijing. Covid 19 found cutting board imported salmon. Noone knows surface salmon workers preping salmon sale. 

Daily throughput market tens thousands, restaurants grocer stores across city. Currently, 100 confirmed cases. However, controlled, 100 cases almost instantaneously develop tens thousands. Contact tracing ongoing going way wide. Thus, lockdown city limit spread. 

If lucky, probably starve thousand cases. quarantine start reopening weeks. unlucky, get thousand cases wuhan entire nation supporting one city. context article, wording focused around things inconclusive. mean anything wrong them. OP's comment correct sense quoting article, sense trying make sure everyone realizes one claiming know anything least happened one time. get scared dismiss it. Probably yelling heard everyone else yelling crowded enclosed bar.  frustrated? really talk feel happy states, pay attention they’re right, recognize they’re past first wave.

I speak Texas I’m here, town 40 percent total cases past week. I’d say 80 percent people aren’t wearing masks caring virus. I’m glad people talking rise cases I’m hoping people start taking basic precautions. Maryland well isn’t going help Texas. read indoor groups wrote due protests. Carpoolerd, bathrooms, etc. guess like ignore like hear.

So suggesting protesters carpooling mass? Using bathrooms together mass?

I've driving rideshare mass. riders still wearing masks. contracted car picking bar hoppers global travelers simply cracking windows, protesters likely high risk even mostly N95 solve eveeything.

Cloth masks (non-N95) shown studies reduce transmission SARS-CoV-2 approximately that, see lot people like wear masks around chins protests.

Oh really? lot people are? recorder protesting activity now? collidial silver work things? me.

Should touted cure? No. think this: oxygen intake limited, limit level difficulty exercises. breathe 50% oxygen, 50% effort used to, half weight, half reps etc, half speed etc. Proportionate it. reason go full throttle time, working ok, matter what. Also, I've heard oxygen inhibitor masks actually used exercising, might want check too. Yeah moving month able get free month rent gift card equal another half month rent. signed two year lease would’ve gotten another month free. However I’m glad didn’t already dropped rent 10% since signed. /r/boneappletea 🙃

Its shoo-in, like moving animal/person saying ""shoo!"" Korea China currently freaking 50 cases...50..

It's funny months ago everyone crying china warning us time, well I'd say NY warned us time. 
Cuomo best job can't accused warning everyone.

In texas yesterday 4,000+ new cases, florida 2000+ arizona 2000+ yet officials still saying masks. mean much feel lives risking. Florida tourist state. feel like would never recover shutdown significant amount time. truth is, right thing takes effort awareness able give. mentally shape, practice. capacity amount caring required. original comment answer question. population 3.25 times population WWI. Plus, war didn’t take place here, limited population enlisted (and therefore increased risk death war)

I didn’t bring lives matter, have. simply added context framed comment, stating 4.4 times days passed American involvement WWI. pivoted worldwide stats, irrelevant conversation US, death rate US, lives lost US servicemen battle Europe. 

Extra special not, number deaths WWI. accelerating. mentioned Spanish Flu exception worldwide pandemics, is. 

Covid19 exception spreading accelerating summer months. super simplifying idea lives matter (which, assuming repeat someone says black lives matter would really make sense). 

Given prior February 6th, 2020 zero American deaths Covid19, deaths different before. Why? prior weren’t Covid19. 2012, two American doctors tested positive recovered. American deaths SARS. 

Covid19 deaths different, American died it. Different doesn’t imply change equality, like pound feathers equal pound bricks. pound, different. 

You’ve framed argument one implying difference equality, one done you. 

If Covid19 deaths aren’t special though (which still different equality), could name new disease impacted US killed people WWI 6 months? Specifically, first reported death 6 months there. isn’t special, easy list.  love site. Reading comments entertaining watching TV YouTube. Keep fear mongering number crunching greatly enjoying myself. tub popcorn... depends buys it. government majority debt, confusing itself, lot also owned foreign powers domestic retirement funds.

Honestly craziest problem effectively 0% interest 0% reserve requirement. Fed even need involved money printing, banks make much get loan applications for. Fed guaranteed markets, basically given banks free reign give bad loans risk carrying loss.  I'm looking new place September.

Im amazed many apartments available $1400 garbage (living one highest col areas u.s.). depends long sit room. close others. (next slot machine?) lot factors. way people behave casinos, I'd say probably going far higher average 17.4% case maskless-indoors. work Target... lol scored 3 month extension price difference. gives us place mid-September, hopefully rent area fall back four years ago. you’re dumb, everyone seems smart you. prob bit heard immunity NYC/NJ area.

just ignore trucks, full of, uh aurora borealis, yeah that's it. active spreader virus already it? Say went super market 2 weeks stopped treating positive, would able reinfect people? Sources appreciated!! would say truly dependent area live go lower. Since Florida spread areas getting hit harder others. havent looked numbers I'm sure miami-dade area taken hit home prices. Tampa area looking like up-and-coming Hotspot. Yea see, can’t blame either covid deaths economy failing he’s clear really depends. know lot couples late 20s $500k-$1 million combined per year range based NYC, SF, LA.

There good chunk people major cities pulling stupid money days. Lol no. Rent area went least 20% Germany also never locked completely. People still went work except higher risk businesses. 

The difference? Test/trace/isolate mandatory masks. 

Tegnell's statement everybody assume infected act accordingly utter BS. infected working inside care home, would go work! care home workers supposed stay home? didn't? Alarming number deaths care homes? *surprised Pikachu*

If want protect elderly, protect general population. wait two weeks^TM renewed lease month left. negotiating, rent raise.

tbf get raised last year either. People going die every single day rest human history.

That reason fly.

It's amazing someone ridiculous suppose sub reason.

No one real world would able keep straight face listening you. guys saying 10 people beach Florida going cause grandma genocide. think drop coming soon. Bay Area Facebook rental groups, see lot people looking new renters take leases. leases up, landlords gonna renegotiate. lot interest people lease takeover listings mean, call Americans dying shit World War 1, 2x Vietnam wars, 35x 9/11s - within 3 months - sure “No crisis”. know were, posted archive link anyone see were. even saying people check archive link. 

The point is: much stricter Sweden's. Imagine Sweden cordoned Stockholm county way Finland cordoned Uusimaa. people desperate need socializing. don’t cause I’m introverted af whatever. wanna take risk he's saying requiring people anything goes constitutional rights. total bullshit.

The argument looking email ""What requirements wear seat belts? rights infringed upon I'm allowed walk around town naked? mean I'm free take drugs drink drive?"" probably next Western Arizona.

Maybe y'all build wall. make Arizona pay it. frickin god. No, doesn’t 100% prevent getting corona guess what? NOTHING does. Masks stop spread 85%, simplest effective thing moment would make indoor places hell lot safer people walking around masks on. That’s “narrative”, that’s truth Stupid. lean middle-right fair number things, political. Wear effing mask. Impressive. Wish landlord rented. take 4 landlords rental board disrepair best break could find.

82 largest non-profit hospitals using IRS 990 informational returns auditing latest year available:

If Internet, would know there's pandemic. Yes, wearing thermals cold here! Physician Alabama. confirm. Source? Here's article announcing first confirmed case Dallas March said, doubtful lady even doubtful tested travel history include China Europe. Even right community spread started sooner thought did, one tested based assumption February. housing market? Looking purchase new home couple months, would love save money.  Abbott call National Guard keep order. Calling Guard something respond crisis, appear responding, opposed principle. Depends jurisdiction. Housing market climbing last year maybe 2016 hit plateau, last year started dropping. bought last year. Able negotiate significant reduction asking price. Rent like slinky: takes time respond ownership market moves too. Rents started going down. Lots people buy house investment property. Many bought market high. want least pay mortgage. can't tend hold rent prices. space remains vacant months they'll motivated move charge mitigate losses. strategy I've seen charge rent get first month free one year lease. vacancy rate increasing last year so. Rents dropping across board. first month offering longer adequate. Last month: ""We locked help hospitals, they're prepared reopen!""

Today: ""Well, every hospital overrun, county/city/state fine. need lock down!""

Next month: ""Well every state overrun, region/country fine. need lock down!"" still agree anyone saying ""AZ next NY"" low population density essentially zero public transit.

The density public transit makes spread easier guarantee anything. Density destiny pandemic. Take Hong Kong. city that's even reliant public transit denser city. Yet, cases nowhere near NYC.

Let's take SF LA. San Francisco second densest big city US New York, yet cases getting worse Los Angeles compared SF. 90% Trump's fault. stopped holding live corona briefings, ya know? People think ""over"". Lol

We hope many die need hospitalization. General: ""But, Sir, tsunami wave""

Trump: ""ARREST NAYSAYER""

Choir: ""Against! The! Wall!"" fuck article? So, wash hands opening meat package, cook meat properly, dispose package appropriately... would safe. Right?  friend who's dad going original Gold's Gym Venice since 1980's says Arnold regular. loves attention anything else. He's kinda guy wants bask public adoration. Nobody wears masks Sweden, FYI.

Before jump semantics, rare masks worn Sweden. friend lives Malmö. Epidemiologists believe least 10x many undiagnosed cases.

Many believe number closer 100x many.

This mild virus vast majority people never experience single symptom ones experience anything makes feel particularly sick never see doctor get tested. mixed feelings due friends family real estate investments. I'd love able afford place hope lose value properties. hate “luxury” become synonymous “new.” Builders use cheapest possible materials build places look trendy, market luxury. Texas 1,500 excess deaths March 15 – May 9

It takes time gather data, evidence shows excess deaths compared years past. much research truly know true scale awful pandemic been. Bruh I'm paying close $7k/month one bedroom Manhattan

In fairness, wages lot jobs actually proportionate cost living here. Like way higher LA even That's southern Illinois argument, ""muh freedom sez wear masks like Chicago libruls! (cough cough sneeze sneeze)"" still lucky, right shithole. Yeah we've Chicago. Mass graves found. west village one desirable expensive places live ~~all NYC,~~ entire world, I’m surprised.

FTFY  People state really interested masks social distancing. We're hammered, people hit gym. latestagecapitalism Finland stricter restrictions, know actually were?

* Uusimaa restrictions, yes that, lasted less three weeks, lifted 15.4 already. Since commuting work allowed main reason people going Uusimaa anyway, actual amount cars crossing Uusimaa border dropped 1/3. Also implementation restriction led marginal infections drops outside Uusimaa, correlation clear all, lifting restriction noticeable effect infections all
* Schools indeed closed Finland, reopened 14.5, plenty time see possible effects. appears schools reopening Finland (same Denmark Norway) effect whatsoever, even necessary first place?
* Restaurants closed Finland, fairly late, 4.4 (it took go necessary legal procedures). peak infections around 9.4. hard see could noticeable effect point.
* Libraries, swimming pools municipal facilities closed Finland reopened 1.6 noticeable effects either.

There major restrictions point, people movement (except Uusimaa border) businesses (except restaurants) never legally limited.

Currently still restaurant occupancy restrictions (today announced would partially lifted 23.6 completely lifted 13.7), public gathering restrictions (in theory people, practice BLM protest 3000 people one gave shit), border restrictions, lifted Baltic Scandinavian countries (except Sweden). life basically returned normal. Yet completely extinguished virus way NZ had, still new cases, yet getting fewer fewer, despite testing capacity pretty great. new infection flares? idea believe anyone knows either. ""brother husband""

I laughed. building MN makes us give 2 month written notice move out, looking bigger place since lot places price range right now, places we've tried contact told us would apply next month, since far move date. really catch-22. turn renewal slip time, lease turns 2 -month lease, still requiring 2 month notice leave get $300 increase rent. least place raising rent month. thought vaccination literally getting virus displaying symptoms may even want to.

i think fear consequences led panic buying (would locked apartment someone knew got it?) Considering apartment complex still evicting people offering leeway affected apart predatory ""lending"" company referral...I already knew had. Fuck Mexicans! Worship Black Man. That’ll downward trend daily deaths 8 weeks you’re talking US whole. Sounds like nothing add conversation. Probably like sauna I'm sorry loss. fucking pandemic. push mom stranger internet. Thank info. estimated came close contact least 320 people.

Last heard, 300 flight mostly still quarantine facility.  55+ mobile home park Mesa, AZ got bought Carlyle group 8 million along 3 parks. Every unit older unit unmovable. Therefore stuck here. would either sell scrap it. park reposesses it. We've already told rent going new year. senior citizens living fixed incomes. still cheaper apartment crappy old mobile home baking 110 degree weather asphalt lot. paying 600 month sit freaking lot! Greedy bastards! strict you, then? Wuhan? well can’t that, here. yes, lots leaders essentially asked indefinite lockdowns, like mayor LA saying lockdown cure - may never one. feel like mental health everyone important right well. healthy keep away people months end. since friends already exposed, take risk seeing order incredibly lonely depressed analogy quite apt. Sphinx also asshole. husband might end moving back in-laws bit. money, house contract might able find house time. houses sale ones get listed contract within days, like ours. know lot older landlords live rental properties. trying maximize profit much try keep income constant keep tenant better. know lot people bring risks vaccines, one problem article talking safety risks Dengue vaccine bring company said safe. many different governing bodies determine vaccines safe (i.e. FDA, etc.). like we're gonna blindly inject entire worlds population we're sure safe.

Second, bring ""There vaccine HIV."" HIV retrovirus, compared SARS-CoV-2. vaccines thus far made Phase II/III elicited immune response (notably, Sinovac reports 90% recipients elicited antibody offering receive Oxford University’s Jenner Institute vaccine warned information sheet safety cannot wholly assured.

Yea that's pretty much would expect see trials new vaccine, that's we're autumn could mark turning point coronavirus battles: may positive vaccine news, know whether second wave infection headed way. Last century’s Spanish flu pandemic came three waves; second, autumn 1918, deadliest.

Comparing Spanish Flu smart either, two different situations. likely we'll see multiple waves COVID-19 yes, Spanish Flus second wave product soldiers coming back home end WWI malnourished riddled bacterial infections, causing immune system overreactions ultimately killed them. Hence, deadly reinfection question yet settled: two milder cold-causing coronaviruses family pandemic virus reinfect people within year.

True doctors think unlikely reinfected COVID-19. body memory immune responses like forgets COVID-19 reinfection possible, second infection generate antibodies — risk antibody-dependent enhancement surfaces again.

I can't tell they're insinuating here. sounds like they're saying common cold coronaviruses cause problems infected COVID-19? Seems feasible think research backs yet. still common cold lose sleep see crop somewhere.

Basically, article conglomerate random examples plant seeds mistrust vaccination process concerning people wary vaccine. Yes fastest we'll likely ever produce vaccine, people realize worlds leading doctors developing vaccines. go rigorous trials government entity they're approved prevention measure COVID-19. like company going say ""Look made vaccine"" going say ""Okay lets inject world it."" They're going repeat trials see replicate results, peer review regulations place. They're also going forget high risk ADE potential vaccine side effects. Again, governing entities going likely recreating studies including high risk individuals, going forget exist. Please, trust science behind vaccine development process, best interests heart. worry designed pharmaceutical company, plenty entities around world attempt verify claims make get vaccine. look excess deaths across country counted Covid: Texas 1,500 excess deaths March 15 – May January, February March, 53,583 Texans died — 1,473 average period previous six years, according USA TODAY Network analysis. Texas attributed 41 deaths COVID-19 Jan. 1 March 31, first victim March 17, according Texas Department State Health Services.

Doctors told USA TODAY Network could missed patients died COVID-19 February early March testing limited then"" SD prices rising, every complex around ""move specials"" first 1-2 months rent free.

The area around UCSD hardest hit, believe since UCSD going remote fall. us protesting, class either demands go back work month working whole pandemic limited employer support. state, outbreaks largely related workplaces, largest cluster infections meat packaging facility despite 1000 person + marches. think I've ever heard anyone say risk protests, would indeed stupid. hand, least every protest to, anyone without mask approached least 5 people extra masks, people distancing, hand sanitizer everywhere. perfect, general feeling forced back unsafe workplaces might well resist extrajudicial state murder, huge problem state well. 
The reality complete individualization disease control accountability ridiculous notion, policy failure since January.

Edit also say I've never seen someone immunocompromised shamed staying home. fact, area people risk staying home supported. antibody tests aren’t conclusive false positives negatives reported. There’s also chance encountering different strain. Overall, I’d take positive news keep aware you’re bullet-proof. I’m lower risk going gym already, I’m also cautious maintaining distance wiping equipment use. Oh hey thanks, generous you. article one submitted makes quite clear mitigation = herd immunity = Swedish strategy seeks reduce speed virus spreads population, accepting large fraction population infected epidemic ends. second case, population likely reach “herd immunity” vaccines new cures immunity reached sufficiently many people become immune make virus die even people live normally. remains unclear infection rate required herd immunity sets COVID-19, initial estimates suggested herd immunity would compatible protecting forty percent Swedish population two approaches usually referred suppress mitigate, respectively. Like countries, Sweden initially sought suppress. Unlike countries, Sweden made early switch mitigate. precisely, **it switched mitigation policy accepted virus spreading controlled fashion** among young healthy, protecting old sick, vulnerable.

ETA: understanding Tegnell disagree Linde’s assessment (that [strategy herd )


This I've saying forever now! pursuing [herd scared say loud. Showing anecdotal scientific reports support anything support ""50/50"" stance claim.

None peers would disagree fact negative outcomes lock downs, climate scientists would say negative outcomes transitioning fossil fuels. consensus weight evidence positives action outweigh admitted negatives inaction (that paper show highlights). one suggesting mitigation measures free pain unintended consequences, saying negatives like paper showed far, far less negative millions Americans dying.

The scientific scales tipped terms mandatory masks/face coverings public. tipped hydroxychloroquine. tipped premature nature states actions open up, due still elevated rates infection across many communities. Yet one political side aisle consistently *against* science. can't accept situation like said poster. 

I absolutely accept that, say didn't? I'm trying tell opportunities available look them. also need understand change situation current one working out.

Step aside Sweden.... We'll show takes get herd immunity.... Open restrictions let cases roll people cling anything makes feel superior! :/ Even things bad bouncing back, never wore mask. 

So that. described. No, think would violation spirit bot.  all, mods sub decided ""right"".

 “it’s he’s dumbass.” frequently check [Watching America ](http://watchingamerica.com/WA/) get perspective countries. Ah, good point. checking numbers lately. :(  Nevada whole saw around 100 cases Monday, *could* backlog. definitely something watch week. Casinos seem like perfect spot superspreading events. Proud dude, never agreed politics he’s shit since left office. He’s one guys think get mad conservative bullshit think they'd ignore tbh. scandals they've last decade everyone pretty much lost respect family, specially politicians. Alzheimer's going get first. systemic problem requires systemic solutions.

It's weird many people confused distinction systemic vs individual things. Good him. Honestly I'd thing thought coronavirus cases tied skiing trips hence infected younger population Dude! Yes!  I'm 4 months smoke free myself, I've never felt fucking good! 

You know, feel like real selfish fuck hole saying this, pandemic actually great me.  quit drinking, quit smoking, saved fuck load money, family never tight.   

I know people suffering place sucks. yah gotta whatever make best life throws you.  I've always known that, year really driven point home me.

Keep awesome work! would bother you? concept term dates back 1930s like century old staple discussions infectious disease welcome New York, bible belt Dude nursing home days making past things rear view mirror. People move nursing homes don’t live long afterwards. could lock completely put bubble would end dying causes vaccine would even ready. California rate growing continuously since start? That's dream. Man, could. Clearly calls reopening... haven’t bar since January lol.. sucks haha  small island nation like New Zealand, would impossible USA due two large porous borders nutbags carrying guns government buildings protest measures taken reduce virus spread. thousands better shape age lol current spikes indication, something fast, may burn peak uncontrolled epidemic even November. Hundreds thousands dead, economy crashed ""now mend, V-shaped recovery!"" agree said except classmate’s comparison flu. nearly every estimation I’ve seen, covid19 still several times deadly season flu age 20-29 bracket. We’re still talking rather small percentages though, overall risk still quite modest. american dumb twat.

Don't generalise much, christ. Ryan: case may remain...Unsolved... Trump right all? Get light fabric mask :). thin cotton hemp breathable. still catch stuff spit out. 

Of course, sweat probably also spreads (I doubt gyms stayed open actually test this, active virus particles found every bodily fluid safe bet) cleaning properly using machines take priority. live Canada I'm temporary layoff due Covid-19. company american based majority buyers suppliers boarder.

I'm worried job lied her. ground glass opacity means. know scary phrase, mean particles consistency lungs, *or* there's long term damage. 

Our best long term study China indicated opacity resolving time, there's reason think completely dissipate vast majority infected. He’s better successes guess... Sigh governing body higher states could literally print money. shovel peoples/businesses pockets pay stay home/closed. Someone get already push bloggers extreme right wing ""news"" sources.. months ago dozens videos NYC hospitals claiming show nobody them.. mostly showed waiting rooms empty National guard tents. mean 7-10 days current trend, exactly great. That’s ok vast majority areas now, fine. Maybe outside can. LOL. idiot. saw start china December make ways Italy, France rest europe January February march finally hit US.


This like standing beach watching tidal wave come. 

Your ignorance bliss. Yup, little right No, safe destination. They’re always going one case away “Beijing”, locking everything. That’s sustainable. 

I don’t say strategy better, it’s obvious people think beat wave 1 you’re done virus. Nothing could wrong. it’s anything like academic conventions, organization eats cost centers aren’t obligated shut event down. field’s main organization would bankrupted cancelled eat cost, they’re basically game chicken state convention center. future think we’ll seeing conferences states took preventative protective measures requiring cancellation policies case outbreak contracts, terrible look convention-heavy areas. late. know feeling completely! 'Murica, ""muh freedums"" excuse. Meaning, feel ""right"" wear mask. looking new lease right I've watching Dallas area market past 6 months prices dropping here. holding steady people offering listed rent prices order get places want. worst I've seen past 8.5 years area. one bedroom $400-600 month, unless plumbing bathroom fixtures made gold. see whole house rented $1000+, tiny place housing one person? WTF? hasan minhaj said america going raw dog rona. carpe diem guys! I'm sorry, men talk weight lifting always sounds super gay me. *Not there's anything wrong that.* Christians thinking end times since literally beginning Christianity shit... think Sweden advantages flattened curve. live alone, work home, culture socially distant western countries, high level trust government, leading people compliant governments suggestions caution.

It interesting see happens New York months, idea could right numbers keep dropping. youre fired Lol, that's even close true. Countries like Italy, Spain, Germany, Slovakia, NZ, Vietnam, successfully safely excited lockdowns (or process so) registering new cases. matter fact, lockdowns lasted 2 months. People states mentioned social distancing wearing masks, hence massive increase new cases. I'm really sorry whole situation US. giving State Governors power employ different kinds lockdown enforcing seriously reluctant part population managed damage economy time made small dent actual presence virus country. caused lockdowns appear useless people lost national stop thing. really hope therapeutics vaccines help soon situation looks dire.... Yeah, know. they're still without equipment need there's still worldwide PPE shortage.

But thanks lying, honest fellow adults govern? (yes, fortunate educated enough recognize real big stinker right away, definitely distressing see immunocompromised people intentionally confused whether N95 masks protective function). Also mass protests.

It's 17 days since first protests started....so spread started there, we'd seeing positive cases around we? Jim &amp; Tammy Bakker low-life predators 2 decades now. Anyone familiar bullshit kinda deserves fleeced. 

Mmm...maybe, IDK that. never heard guy already selling Silver Solution. said, pretty easy figure bullshitting whole time, still. heard prior this. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Let's disparage entire bird family.

Trump ADD president ADD country. Let's go ride bikes! speak CCP reddit silenced. bots everywhere here, downvoting every comment even *remotely* critical CCP. can't handle criticism. Oh man look go. Anytime folks tell worthless refer thread right here. comment bunch ellipses worth reading. NYC plunged head underground initial upswing, look happened there. west coast spots got front days instead, massive difference. We'll see, feels like Mid March again. probe pandemic one best times. could give us clues spreads, nature virus, anything works it, etc.

You're going elaborate would work, given billions already poured researching spread dynamics studying everything nicotine ivermectin treating it. Don’t feed troll bot accounts Christ, good media said thanks blm protests/riots Meanwhile conservative grandma text dr Fauci liar don’t need wear mask... think might actually deserve 

They banned nationwide sale salmon. Yes, excellent. Fuck Florida. flu seasonal people spend time indoors northern hemisphere. 

What it’s reverse southern states. summer goes full swing becomes unbearable outside people say indoors AC rooms. 

It may hit hard summer Southern states. mean human being.

Don't gross check back tomorrow. god real, wouldn’t give fuck us anyway. go look ask Reddit section people 20s 30s posting experiences. permeant kidney problems, others permeant lung scaring can't run exercise anymore.

Then fine.

This scare people taking seriously. healthy 28 year old getting sick told going dyalisis Covid...not great. True. WW1 lasted nearly 4.5 years, really wait fall 2024 count dead Covid comparison.   end day, illness pandemic comes throw constitutional rights window.”

Say walk bank cash check. you’re wearing pants. teller says, “Leave I’m calling police, don’t come back dick’s hanging front God Jesus everybody.” 

This like that, wearing pants helped prevent people needlessly getting sick dying. 

Requiring pants infringe upon “constitutional rights.” neither requiring mask FUCKING PANDEMIC MISERABLE, LOWLIFE, PANDERING, SOULLESS, REDNECK PIECE SHIT.

—a fellow Alabamian Nope. 03, press repair company worked for, went under. went road pilot driver oversize loads. Came road 09 became successful medical marijuana caregiver. Still truckin 69... crazy! friend i'll chat with. jersey i'm working bar places everyone's like, shockingly respectful masks space. i'm sorry situation different, stay safe. She’s also healthcare worker, whatever means situation. like winter north drives seasonal colds flu. Huge difference doctors wearing masks us idiots wearing them. I'm citing Science Vs (Podcast Gimlet media) here, noticeable difference made masks general population, suck using (that's surgical masks). studies cloth masks far. Cases falling nw Arizona near Colorado river. cases California people coming town. there's cases ever. We're definitely incubating virus gotta leaving visit back California. summer ends older snowbirds come wonder situation could go. droplet precaution rooms require masks? protecting flu patient getting non flu? Shit. hope things eventually improve you. it’s worth, story convinced remain vigilant precautions. feel like little lax lately. It’s worth gambling.  Wrong. Australia's contract tracing app open source. Source? portas safer regular toilets cleaned regularly? poo drops blue water instead getting aerosoled flush. Australia actually done bang job. One best, imo.

And probe pandemic one best times. could give us clues spreads, nature virus, anything works it, etc. Used politics? would point? stage it’s evident president could shoot someone fifth avenue would change nothing. reopen crew never counted reopening causing rolling restaurant closures PRC backed international probe looking origin virus UN.

AFAIK country remain opposed USA. younger, means anyone age 105 That's headline means met young guy years ago named Adolf, US. Perhaps family name?? strange nonetheless. Candido auris, anyone? said may become problem. 

And doom porners think people dying streets. 

You stop elective surgeries, need be. 

No problema never one person. Taking covid karens little literally harsh definitely board border staying closed long takes, feel really awful cases like yours. Hopefully US get act together get vaccine (likely going second one). Paraguay. That's seen ok far. Lol word used ""affordable""

Like Obamacare $3,600 yearly premium plus $6,000 deductible considered affordable. real cure stupid, ultimately.

There also cure corona, let's wear masks ignore super contagious respiratory virus didnt get yet. work fine probably. went school Siri. Surgical masks n95s. stuff CDC told us wear leave you. actually sheds skin, candido auris pregnant wife test. Inducing 5 days. Test wasn’t bad said. new one doesn’t hurt. Maybe I'm dumb see

Like people.  immune, don’t need wear mask, social distance. many deaths world war sound like something that's overblown me. one people thinks statistics inflated made up, please come back hard evidence this. cable news story someone somewhere maybe died car crash instead COVID count.

Since we're clearing assumptions here, agree lockdown damaging many people. government failed rapidly deploy effective safety net people. I'm fortunate enough work industry could keep employees keep us safe well compensated know that's case majority. I'm favor well controlled well defined reopenings guided science data. Unfortunately there's large contingency decided hoax reopening fast enough. Schools, manufacturing, retail restaurants reopening well defined protocols protecting people opportunities people work home want need to. Instead packed bars reopening big birthday parties masks sight people decided big deal.

I'm repeating COVID end world death sentence could handled lot better continuing cavalier dismissive virus kill people. I’ve lot states past month half. personal observation mask use saw. I’ll start least.

Georgia damn near 0 Savanna. 

What surprising rapid improvement Md stats starting 2 weeks mask requirement went effect. Percentages positive cases, total daily positive cases, hospitalizations. plummeted since. 

Virginia interesting since mask requirement. Walmart. Huge sign saying masks required. even 50% people inside on. mean fact educated people children later life less kids, less educated people younger them, takes generations quickly outnumbered assuming enough idiots get social educational class. they’re morons.

So sick shit. want get lasting effects complications see like Insert taps head twice gif 🤓 southern states horrible summer/fall temps reach 100+ live nyc wearing masks social distancing numbers lowest country. Many places don’t practice cases skyrocketing. There’s much empirical evidence world prove handle virus yet America people like say dumb shit like are. Mass gatherings happening country says old news. told social distance people anymore, turn news proof. Best game musical chairs ever you’re big city, ask people expect get economy going don’t take basic protections. Office buildings abandoned 25 percent occupied. Regardless big bad government does, company bring people back work floor floor cubicles keep getting sick. like not, economy depend restaurants bars, non-essential retail. depends companies organizations fill office buildings across country world. 

We’ve living lockdown la-la land, lulled false sense security. considering fact vast majority cases caused type indoor spaces us months. 

We’ve big grocery big box stores relatively easy physically distance ourselves. many us want get crowded bus, train office, go concert basketball game full arena? BMI really simplistic formula, mostly works broad range people either side average height. gets increasingly inaccurate shorter taller average.

Being muscular throws less would think.  Muscle 18% dense fat. means heroically exercised much converted 10% body volume fat muscle (wow!), BMI reading would go 1.8%. ([not BMI definitely oversimplified, also good enough time.

There better formulas, one number ever tell whole story people, matter good formula is. live?? state nothing like haha never stoping spread virus.....you never put genie back bottle.....it's whelming hospital....ifs question going get it, already 3M's website.

**Masks**

""Masks help protect sterile field. designed protect patient exhaled microorganisms healthcare provider. Masks FDA cleared.""

**Respirators**

""They certified NIOSH N95's designed provide secure face-to-respirator seal. seal helps reduce wearer's exposure airborne Thanks, I'm well aware BMI still use, quite flawed individual basis. Anecdotally, really see many ""Obese"" people got way packing muscle, that's seeing, suppose anything possible.  mean... Typical. important wear masks social distance thing started it’s anymore? Because... you’re tired it? It’s disease, doesn’t go away you’re bored. keep wearing protecting others. They'll say want right thing. Good job man. Almost everyone live still wear masks time wherever go alone. Kind tired everyone highlighting reopening..... come stop overlooking protests mass gatherings Fuck guy!!!

His administration treated CoVID19 like big deal months, he’s blaming young people? wonder everyone Pa brings back Rehoboth, Ocean City Wildwood. states stay way, restrictions lifted surprised mass gatherings exactly convinced others COVID-19 thing old news. Media really care either, juicier stories get clicks on. fall ugly. You’re looking one data point, local temperature effect transmission. Fall means lot temperature shift.

Many areas reopen K-12 higher education schools allowing nice transmission vector. Even people adhered good social hygiene showing signs fatigue, won’t improve fall. You’ll greater transmission rates Covid mixed healthcare system dealing increasing rates cough/cold flu. overloading healthcare resources, confusion presentation, etc... highly doubt response fed state governments quick pitiful response round one. many downvotes vacation. I'm glad mention staying days New York City visit relatives. get you’re saying also think there’s false equivalency statement comes pro vs anti science. One side years preached intelligent design, earth 6000 years old, deep state conspiracies, preaching anti-mask usage, protesting assault rifles public health officials governors left dry feds tried mitigate damage. would say doomers vs deniers better example. Also, check % positive counterbalance total tests. know SC % positive like tripled past couple weeks. best right. Um, 120k people die one.

Yolo. Making widespread wearing even necessary. fact 80% people mild illness reiterated since beginning, even CDC. revelation. 'it's dangerous go'

Sorry again, read stop thyroid madness that's hypothyroidism, mine / hyperthyroidism. think B12 issue completely separate entirely thyroid issue, that's levelled degree. much coincidence occurred post February coronavirus. blood tests bear out.

I suffered thyroid related problems year (fast heart rate, sore eyes etc) right. dumb realize trump immediately throw bus whim, even though Trump already done many times people presidency. I've lost track many people he's already gone administration. Welcome Hoosier land. Pence literally fuck tight little asshole. It’s beautiful God. people. Really shows effective ""Bread Circus"" it. People addicted distractions luxury refuse save lives. Right??? That’s are. thought California one rational states sound like pissed smoker, angry can't quit. Goon, flu season 13 weeks. 80k+ deaths past less 6 months. secondhand smoke deaths eliminated quitting smoking. care much social distancing respecting others health safety, quit smoking. smoke upvoted post hypocrite. Millions people died since modernization big tobacco. Show respect. We're talking entire histories death make corona joke. prevention obvious direct disease prevention. know smoker know prevent killing people selfish addiction.  can’t afford it!?

Feels like one moments tax dollars pays for! suggestion?

Let economy California shut 2022ish? hmm. maybe switched outdoor services indoor services.

oregon live kept mentioning videos churchs facebook account, information actually them.

turns local paper town first hand accounts videos probably deleted realized problem. lol. COVID-19 old news. people mass gatherings streets look Seattle. two politicians. ""Set controls heart sun""

I hear heat kills Coronavirus. Fox News still mostly working remotely? sympathies, sucks. I'm sure told countless times, yo-yoing best.

Personally, I've taken control eating via fasting, worked well me, even though never got big did. might want look it. r/intermittent_fasting.

Good luck, hope things turn around.   I'm obese American. I've working losing weight since giving birth last child, stress eat. state reopening, fear acquiring COVID older, obese woman, employer requiring everyone return work end month making want nothing carbs. 

It help I've using grocery delivery service since lockdown began, fresh frozen vegetables keep getting dropped orders. looked produce delivery service, they'll deliver area middle weekday. hard time try get healthier. That's exactly feel. wear mask protect choose here, wear one protect here! dont think shivsena count. expect number change lol Well first world entitlement attitude...

I'm mildly uncomfortable! Make stop!!  One night takes, morons Yeah shit. He’s correct, first wave may over... He’ll run office again. Why? wasn’t running office, he’d right thing. 

Seems counterintuitive, one party scared losing primary someone batshit crazy are, it’s race bottom. Stupidity, much like covid-19, boundaries... Harvard expert - “yeah red” 
News “Harvard says red important color world here’s why” Yeah. people acting like wearing mask choice deciding get Wendy's value menu.

How side crippling pandemic whole family?  said people wear masks...I don’t give shit kind want wear Move everything outside pray Oxford vaccine works. can't take double, let alone quad... I'm actually avoiding going back this. I'm part state observing mask wearing pretty well. know I'll get dirty looks somehow wearing mask infringes freedoms.  ain't China thinks that. Australia think US control what’s needed right now... curious, Arizona's covid dashboard excellent. clear, well laid out, every piece information could pretty much ever want know. I'm keeping eye Arizona obvious reasons, dashboard much better source majority news articles. ""Cases spike Arizona"" helpful; least me, seeing actual data much valuable. think MythBusters episode concluded get toothbrush it’s open. points:  higher rate BCG coverage 99% Vietnam 93.70% ([http://www.bcgatlas.org](http://www.bcgatlas.org)) India still much higher COVID-19 rate Vietnam SE Asia countries

The difference could due level honest reporting. coincident Vietnam ranks near bottom Press Freedom Index, 175th 180 countries surveyed barely beating China's 177th ranking course, China's dishonest reporting reason Covid-19 epidemic became pandemic today.

Granted, India's 142nd ranking something cheer about, still significantly higher China Vietnam. currently empirical evidence BCG vaccination provides protection COVID-19 acute respiratory infections. Currently two clinical trial subject. call this?

**Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination reported decrease susceptibility respiratory tract infections, effect proposed mediated general long-term boosting innate immune mechanisms, also termed trained immunity**  called taking precautions, propaganda  people complaining reopening massive protests/gatherings going weeks ""if happening me, big deal""

Good wearing mask! wear mine too. Nobody panicking. That's problem. California next New York. Can't wait see 17k packed next Saturday Oklahoma. claimed majority protesters wearing masks. said doubt that. What’s point lying social distancing safety support cause? even read thread get upset called BLM protestors wearing masks lmfao Maybe understand numbers... think US knows firsthand point

We’re willing impose martial law quell outbreak I’ve never said anything differentiating two? talking about? Well, kudos least getting accounting right. Shucks, thank stranger. appreciate :) think one biggest factors isn’t enough discussion modern medicine saved many people would otherwise died 100 years ago without extreme medical intervention. artificially inflates survival rate. don’t think get deadly disease truly region poor health care, ability report infection rates, gets hit pretty bad. do. must regional thing then. work old New England money. One customers dated Kennedy sort rich. would never act like lol. They're CEOs large business owners, highly educated liberal. They're grounded though carry mindset all. even socialize amongst unless outside, less 5 people, least 6 feet apart. siblings lol. Seems regional differences culture education matter - wealth allows flaunt stupidity ha thought president giving something free group people probably large numbers protesting streets? I'm buyin'...he's already let 117,000 people die gross negligence. think he's comfortable lot dead especially sates vile ego. agree, fucked. way worded dumb. ""Most people going recover fully"" good.

In opinion, think high percentage people recover fully. would've thought healthcare worker would know difference n95 surgical mask. Kinda makes wonder they'll stay put come Nov/Dec they'll still head escape snow. really hope control winter rate going, I'm confident will. cases quadruple gonna alright   hate it. hate coming home still “feeling” mask wore day. Lol. end day, keeps us literally dying, nothing would place importance wearing damn mask! customers easy, need handful minutes! Trump’s new strategy apparently pretending covid doesn’t exist. Let states open economy goes wins election. Fuck people die apparently. 200k predicted dead October seems like trump America like meh?? White House attacked US citizens every single last person building needs arrested. protesters anything say now, I’m feeling pretty upset, pretty sad they’re good people,” said. “There’s lot good people said virus hit everyone pastors church hard say came from,” said. “I member claims President Trump deemed churches houses worship essential late last month, Lighthouse opened back up. said guidelines guess least 300 members handwashing station outside door came in,” told FOX 12. “People wore mask, tried social distance stay away people respect other’s space,” continued. video recent worship service church’s Facebook page shows large group churchgoers social distancing.

It sound like outside You’re pos too. Don’t fool yourself. goal stop spread. always was. Flatten curve means stop spreading. Slowing would case stopping wasn’t option, is.
Look ny. Went worst world best country. rest ample time warning refused still refuse right thing. go essentials, stay fuck home. Stop putting people risk. adrenal insufficiency- it’s opposite us, miserable doesn’t take meds (there bunch others takes, too.) takes prednisone now, rest life. Yeah get it... Perfect answer! lmao, look mirror depends consider benefit. mean severe? lol   website garbage.

Even city mayors asking allow local governments enforce requirement. nothing started claiming local government problem. tells can’t enforce anything. criminal, TBH. who? could seen coming? Thank kind words :). Thankfully stay home 2 yr old, stress easy manage without go job wild. Also, tell people I'm scared another major abdominal surgery fully conscious, care newborn right after....it's swab nose I'm dreading. patients tested upon admittance. Bleh.  I'll put potential investor database 'maybe' Don’t wildfires here

I use work professionally home. 

Now I’m going feel like jerk wearing store. Couldn’t lean. Definitely strictly corona virus I’m even sure dumbass went even knows Murphy’s Law fuck defend cnn? Thats shit's fucked, latter would true hostpitals overwhelmed way would died. 100k+ people may seem like lot consider mostly old people already plenty diseases + hundreds thousands die US every year due various diseases (but gets coverage)

Also I'm talking contained worldwide. Really Brazil still messy cousin Google Smith living shit years. You‘re countering misinformation by... spreading misinformation. Implying spanish flu comparable almost offending people live it. Ha! Wait real second wave! states finally extensive community spread. since serious

lol tested Full Celiac panel? Thyroid autoimmune diseases Celiac go hand hand 😥 welcome, honesty could find another job could support family on, I'd love there.

Lucky Fauci.. get hear every day.  think forgot /s... Could places sure. think general upswing opening though. Save wildfires.

Sell folks need work like construction workers, hobbies like woodworkers. Also, determine long stay closed. argument businesses instead relying broad government mandate, open ~~financially decide should~~ safe  would nothing sub become irrelevant. think Texas going hit 20K deaths? fair, Ford raging anti-Semite. tested Full Celiac panel? ah yes, people dying today relieved know death actually 1/3rd worth counting someone 100 years ago. #progress.

When first started go late Febuary early March, one neighbors got sick couple days, high fever, quick (2-3 days). decided get tested and...they it, least tested positive.

Now 3 days prior person showing symptoms small party backyard, masks time, social distancing effect. 

No one else got sick. wife around whole time. get sick. working neighbors house installing bathroom 1 day prior onset symptoms. one house got sick.

So...either false positive, or, again, know less disease think do.

Many early European outbreaks vacation hotspots time year (the Alps, Northern Italy, Spain etc.) high influx people (from around globe) high levels mobility. Eastern Europe made interesting diverse nations increasing tourist appeal, reaches levels hard-struck areas southern Europe.

The high-mobility tourists/business-people brought virus home, would affect countries others, depending amount people travelling to/from affected areas particular period time (pre-lockdown).

Only really assess fast individual countries responded spread Europe - countries low early spread general successful measures took.

That said, early containment STILL great feat, celebrated! important remember spread happened begin countries time react late various reasons (of mentioned single one example). aren't. Many restaurants losing money, would lose even money closed, due still pay rent, insurance, loan payments, on.

In addition, closed long time, would lose eimployees, would hire train entirely new staff over. keep going long owners withstand money they're losing. Insurance get really complicated really know good not. high deductible plans, $6000 is, actually cover lots stuff without deductible mess understand. Government workers, union people, people whats thought ""good insurance"" usually deductibles $500 $1000 range. 30 days later  think people forgotten thing exponential.

\*insert dog fire comic\* arguing whether deaths abroad matter US deaths, youre still ignoring fact hundreds thousands counting ALREADY died, millions worldwide. youre still trying push narrative ""lockdown kill dont open"" PEOPLE STILL DYING. fucking blind be? TLDR: 11 new imported case, 33 new domestic cases, 11 new asymptomatic carriers

Translation:

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 16/06/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 44 new confirmed case COVID-19, 11 imported (Gansu 10, Sichuan 1), 33 domestic cases (Beijing 31, Hebei 1, Zhejiang 1). new deaths, new suspected cases 3, domestic (all Beijing).

Then emerge, minimal economic harm, etc. would bring things:

* lot less damage economy still zero - many entire lines business especially tourism travel still going destroyed matter pandemic. Also live events, sports, conferences, etc.
* lot less disruption separation employees employers. 

Unfortunately, US suffering total lack leadership spine. enough leadership DC pull co-ordinated, national, total lock 15 days. Even saved trillions stimulus. Trump can't handle everything else that's going on, he's simple. 120 total, 750/day. wonder stupid wonder tried Prednisone Imuran..My kid autoimmune hepatitis. saved life. study saying 1/3 American population *will* suffer extreme symptoms death covid. saying 1/3 American population comorbidities place *at risk* experience things. fight without issue, smaller percentage won't. equal risk getting covid unequal outcomes acquired it. problem know *who* people be. understand now?

US probably won’t agree anything more, we’ll take one month time. muh liberties /s said shutdowns would cause deaths covide never bothered let us know actually meant ""globally"" ""way way line like maybe next year."" piss garbage argument.

Also worth noting ~2k cases March early April severe 2k cases right now, due wider availability testing. much stricter criteria tested plenty uncounted cases didn’t severe enough symptoms tested. it’s possible Michigan Pennsylvania peaking right now, testing far available, total confirmed cases could significantly higher. already fucked knees disabled lose probably post then. case, ignore. place stupid shitposting. take subreddits relevant. wash rinse enough, virus made dent Florida people vacation couple Arizona gotten two days prior, self quarantine. turn out? lost sense smell today I’m bugging Reported.

But...one, it’s hell coincidence I’d never majorly ill entire life like vomiting weeks losing 20+ lbs ill...second, specialist (I specialist lol) says he’s “reasonably certain”...I live highly affected northeastern state...that doctor nearly died covid 6-ish weeks ago

Friends mine used rent pretty big house (German) village. heating bill literally higher rent. FL both!  mom nursing home back went visit her, staff dragged medication cart parking lot, prying open steal pain meds. got next day. Gene pool gets little smaller NC trusting beliefs science.

So sad many bear burden ones wearing masks. Lovely, I'll August. lol Mid-air? works LVN, licences vocational nurse (called LPN rest US), skilled nursing facility hit. brought CNA (nursing assistant, clean move patients) visited family member hospital. 

The skilled nursing facility (SNF) made one wing COVID wing number cases continues increase insurance providers (County, Kaiser) implement testing. tested negative tested today. Imagine would ventilatiors, oxygen modern medical devices. would close 1918 flu numbers wonder happen less developed countries. This. Living Fiancee's parents right like constant emotional vortex. Ugh wish anywhere could go! high risk groups routinely continuously denied treatment they’re part statistics. Wouldn’t mean numbers hospitalizations still good metric? Otherwise make sense.

Not hospitalized risk groups. NC 1,000 new cases today. Good luck that. dying countrymen 
May Mexicans loot lands swiftly maybe swedish government trying sell none really cares sweden doing, even less want follow failing strategy. time read articles sweden point badly failed.

What swedish government say countries first started mild restrictions went TEMPORARY lockdown situation would control lockdown would lifted little little. plan since beginning everybody else.

By time sweden got first covid death countries already implemented restrictions, started converting production masks available increased testing capabilities. already lockdowns!!!

By time sweden decided FOLLOW others increasing testing (they failed months people saying testing useless) 10 days ago... countries got situation control, increased testing least order magnitude, distributed millions masks, lifted lockdown, started mass blood tests, developed released contact tracing apps, put new procedures workplaces (including bars restaurants), reopened internal travel (yesterday also EU travel), activated monitoring systems prepared early detection new outbreaks case set new restrictions.

So opposite. Sweden took wrong path others months ago. 5000 avoidable deaths. No, that's certainly incorrect. economic impact mitigation would (or be, states attempting it) far worse suppression. States successful suppression able reopen economy, mitigation simply get worse next year.

Of course, idiotic federal handling stay-at-home, spending trillions actually using money productive way economically, caused US 40 million unemployed. Well-run countries needed panic lockdown problem.

It mistake blame response pandemic effects pandemic. kind mistake leads people even worse response pandemic cause far higher effects. bunch redditors call ignorant....

Yet... words ""that's close Spanish estimate 1.1%"".

Perhaps meant ""closer"", case, sure. asking numbers seemed far apart (nearly 40%, said), trying clarify *which* number thought close 1.1. thought perhaps misinterpreting account 1.28 ratio, first question. 

I commenting what's likely all, trying figure meant. comparisons useful. covid epidemic without measures slow down, risk death, paper calculates it, would higher. risk death minute taking account measures state taken now. 

And make matters worse, paper compares apples oranges. can't really say X people died therefore, covid dangerous daily activity year would result number dead people.

Somebody else replied saw press conference said gov said something along lines “ two positive cases airport week, 260 far said something 50% infection rate obviously incorrect press didn’t follow that. seems everyone kind messed up. believe means virus still present entire time since first infection, stopped showing symptoms (which resurgence). 

Whereas reactivation would body cleared virus completely, become infected develop symptoms like first infection.

TLDR former one infection total, latter two separate infections Woohoo! NY 2 bedroom 5400 5100! /s **Health official:** busts ass, working 80 hour work-weeks save masses' lives.

**The masses:** issue death threats health official trying save lives.

That's horrid dystopian shit. world come to? It’s largest world actually.

Edit: someone else said already I’ll keep it. Like hot air... Hilarious image. I'm looking state company right wondering world everything opening back up. There's clearly false sense security among certain portion public. People stopped wearing masks going around like nothing happening

I get it. could handled much better, are. tell boss feel weird coming back, likely everything shut month.

Ol' mate Scotty nothing - state premiers carried country success. QLD/WA/SA premiers deserve credit. Vic deserves credit pretty compliant keeping testing rates high. NSW premier dragged kicking screaming something (after letting boat people in, Scotty enjoying footy). Nope, halted funding back April felt handled outbreak poorly. Google it. exactly it. Trump team fucked us. lifted mask rule shopping Austria Monday. Travelled Tuesday went shopping groceries wore mask.
Got weird looks people one guy shamed wearing one front cashier.

I hope? weird year, wishing something bad would happen many many bad things prevented happening. boyfriend’s coworkers (specialized construction) wearing masks anymore since county went green PA (where still wearing masks despite reopening). Boyfriend wearing one unwilling tell coworkers wear one. He’s young lacks seniority. I’m pissed job site enforcing masks. I’m open suggestion do. 330m bought masks spread would contained significantly. People weren’t able get masks might also cautious public. 

Instead fraction people wore masks rest went around business usual. 2 million cases here. Quite lot, hopefully regular Wednesday backlog number. record, ""fairy tale"".

Problem is, they'll get people sick. always issue. People like self quarantine. Yea would required federal government admitting problem lol Covid-19 2: electric bogaloo would thought would blamed BLM. One thing certain going blame himself. don’t get absolutely evidence anyone made efforts make emergency supplies masks. virus required 3 trillion dollar stimulus destroy economy. couldn’t tell everyone wear masks getting medical professionals quietly massively ramping production hospitals supplied would ton good masks available like March? Obviously mask usage huge impact infection numbers. 109,000 dead 3 trillion spent one charge thought “hmmmm... could cause big demand masks.” feel exact way. I’m horrified. Let’s say Trump wins next wave thing mutates gets worse whatever? fact didn’t even care try terrifying. from? LMAO reopening bars. Humans dumb hilarious. Actually article says plan coming back, wasn’t permanently leaving gym, title implies. says plans returning there’s vaccine, change policy. better now? actually confuses fuck remember like feb March surgeon general showed us make mask tshirt two rubber bands even made masks mandatory. It’s like people kinda forgot opted medical grade like keeps safer... Please look actually said. He's always pretty clear this. Attacks Fauci dumbest shit I've ever seen. Two people sitting across dinner dining table certainly higher risk crowd people marching outdoors open air. Air circulation affects transmission significantly. friend works one smaller theme parks Orlando. Almost people talks state. Michigan, Illinois, New York Pennsylvania. think many people need convincing People hoard epidemic taught us ANYTHING people avoided hoarding told MASKS MATTER .

But now.... people saying MASKS MATTER! 

Instead tkaing decision peoples hands charitable share masks whatever local medical community decision made dishonest people trust rganization even less. 

Yes people would hoarded think there's way communicate importance masks WITHOUT discrediting benefit . 

IT foolish like everything else makes people distrustful authority even weh nwe EALLY need people wear masks beleive because.... remember Dr. Fauci said masks help much ?

He administration shot foot long term stop multi-month surge masks purchases could hae still benefited community donations government seizures materials happened anyway ?

This helped nothing damaged messaging go forward.. media can't even PRETEND unbiased. stations talking left wing protests saying awesome there's risk, Trump rally? Nothing crocodile tears COVID risk. equally stupid, media proves untrustworthy surprise nobody trusts virus coverage? thoughts Laurie Garrett? think reading books Coming Plague, Betrayal, good people say? shit make law everybody wear masks indoors place business, excluding home businesses course. Simple that. enforce it. Give tickets time see someone without mask. Even cheap 25 dollar tickets something. couple people wear masks. Serological surveys pinned ifr somewhere .5 1.2% understanding number potentially triples absence healthcare. 10% rate thought initially seeing Italy, reality good idea ifr now. really think people hours protests? People sweating, wiping sweat eyes. Masks really help person sick spreading well, full seal mask, barely people outside have. think Florida getting crushed right now? Yeah, anyone's anti-Christ... (though iirc actually one Roman emperors whole 666 thing referred to) Weather forecasts gotten pretty good. tiger blood I'm interested that's immediately started making 300 million cloth masks everyone, right? Right? Masks bullshit Yeah, makes sense preparing three months notice making masks. Mmm still sure buddy? But...they though? Ironically enough, even Trump said once, lot people laughed thought talking doctors wearing scarf.  much hindsight go around, focus Fauci’s decision?

This 1 Reddit post made. Posting &amp; commenting particular article necessarily mean we're ""focused"" it.

But personally outraged:

1. could (and *should*) simply encouraged Americans wear homemade masks. ended anyway!
FFS, grab old t-shirt &amp; secure damn hair clip blinder clip! &amp; masks MANDATORY many better way.

2. Deliberately withholding information, particularly life-saving info, lying problem that. 
Esp now, LOST CREDIBILITY. I'm flat-earther, damn, understand nut-jobs coming read headlines like this.
&amp; week ago said, ""Asymptomatic spread coronavirus ‘very rare,’"" &amp; retracted statement next day! weren’t going open promised federal immunity negligence suits resulting outbreaks campus. think overestimating desire parents pay money send kids die. 

After summer, universities open campus classes. made better plans. Many facing lawsuits right tuition cannot refuse repay. NBA already return plan set july 30th .....awww... hung up.... :/ 

XD churches really fucking things up. First priests inappropriate acts youth. this. going hold accountable... anything. seem get pass bad shit do. Nope, make claim, provide evidence. Sounds like hard. People seem decided freedom whatever want comes socially responsible. can't punch level idiocy logic, sure. Bring RNC! Pack gills. Plus alot young folks could asymomatic, spreading folks. got banned subreddit partly mod believe outdoor spread possible Genocide? Gross negligence intentional. they’re don’t give fuck COVID-19 Outdoor transmission less likely indoor relatively speaking, 1000 people outdoors together that's still HUGE risk compared 2 people meeting indoors. Two things:

1. People like inconvenienced slightest 

2. politicized. one dumbest things history, has.

For point number 1 there, look people wear masks, can't bothered cover nose wear properly. feel bit stifled uncomfortable wearing masks 15-20 minutes outside, prefer wear halfway. 

It's reason people dump trash subway floor without second thought. They're outright evil, kinda dumb. uncaring. Yes, plus way covering lack action prepare us pandemic. knew early game could companies ramp production masks protect Americans. Instead played ignorant card stating enough evidence support kept telling us risk remains low. corrupt. blame MSNBC CNN that, sure seemed less concerned giant groups spreading COVID 19, anti lockdown protesters. huge supporter PEACEFUL protests injustice, cannot pretend risk renewed spread there. South Carolina pretty bad too, least bowling alleys open now! Yes absolutely. Reddit echo chamber design, focused subreddits (especially one) tend squash alternative viewpoints settle one culture. People like leave, people exacerbate it.

You stay informed, remember internet real world. Moderate opinions get upvotes Fauci always pretty clear this. I'm sure talking about. point quote think Fauci lied us? much respect him, seem listening him. January many videos pictures going China. Al negative images going pretty much negates though outsiders access.

In speaking folks Toronto family members there, things fine. Many still dont know anybody gotten it. First: what?

Second, though probably engage: umm realize evolve wear masks so? done anything strenuous wearing one? feels like suffocating hot humid air. can't imagine giving birth one on... wave 1 never stopped? states didn’t plateau? really bothers see things written like ""no masks streets"".

The chance getting walking past someone outside incredibly small!

Inside, yes, wear mask. love God stop shaming people talking walk one on. Hey, least didn’t pull Georgia rearrange dates along x-axis make appear trend declining. wouldn’t click it. majority us ok bunch wearing masks likely get virus. Oh well. knew lockdowns would come go though going forward Yeah Illinois don’t wear mask outside able maintain 6 feet distance. 
I typically don’t wear mask walking easily maintain space others, I’ll put entering store enter congested area like busy sidewalk can’t maintain social distance Germany simply used scarfs bandana-like cloths people started sewing masks corona hobby medical masks became widely available public. It’s matter strategy Gov. US simply doesn’t one underlying cause. competent administration would bought every mask available healthcare, set emergency manufacturing supply chains, spending 2 days would told public wear masks, provides guidance plans make own. 

THIS ISNT HARD PEOPLE.  Trump admin stunningly stupid corrupt. numerous instances reported major outlets. Use google. People still are. infer young people don' take responsibility actions. That's fair point. 

But take responsibility actions get Virus.

I go street country every single day, yet one family Virus. neither I.

Why? Cuz take responsible steps limit chances getting it. fear streets cuz take right actions

I 59 health issues, choice go eat. Fun fact: waves overlap Fuck Fauci. Lying piece shit. Im attending Trump rallies voting Trump November. 4 years God Emperor!!! Public health reality human behavior means triage. NEED healthcare continue million reasons outside of, including, coronavirus. Also, healthcare providers part option stay home, recommend people reduce exposure, exposed repeatedly known cases coronavirus. yeah, rank little higher list. think people gonna like 'only one N95 per customer... better put 3000 back end grainy world star video punching 16 year old cashier'

Overall, handling whole thing bad, keep reaching back spinning bit without context feed outrage mob disingenuous. You’re thinking filtration. long everyone wears mask, doesn’t go long time, washes hands regularly, disinfects surfaces, touch face, it’s easy get sick. get refugee status guys yet? want ride. even secret, saying start I’m trying understand US daily deaths trending downward total number daily cases fairly stable 20k-25k past month? I’m referring charts site: don’t think treatment disease gotten much better yet, I’ve read several states fudging numbers, doesn’t seem like would account big change. somebody ELI5? One bunch manbabies cried wait 3 months haircut. group people fighting stop unmerited slaughtering minorities protect them. watches watchmen? do. 

They protesting lives danger. protesting lives INCONVENIENCED. know difference hard spot it’s friend. go hungry. Delivery grocery stores open entirety lockdown. bring psychological absurdities nothing left stand on. Oh yea man know what’s real psychological trauma? Watching president rape country grew loved. 

You’re right one thing though, you’re American. think sit sidelines outsider perspective accurately depict happening country asinine. You’re worth time downvote, far misguided. post appears foil idea since people now, diminish fact Americans died Covid19 Americans died WWI. 

If point something else, nothing comes mind. diminish impact deaths, sound like asshole. ""As know, group completely mandatory anything""

And yet drives correct side road, driver's license, pays purchases stores instead stealing them, complies countless government societal rules, laws mandates daily basis... 

But taking stand things net many clicks old 'Like' button like-minded, self-centered morons. Nah don’t think works way. trying apply logic conspiracy theory logic. 

If afraid vaccine injury, don’t believe covid think China purpose commend vigilance! must difficult little ones, you’re keeping safe best them! things open housing market crashing? They're spreading droplets therefore risking people's lives... least according everything told months BLM protests. 

There plenty people crowds wearing masks, even CNN couldnt hide view. tell they're potentially putting communities risk.

The virus care cops racist, like care people want jobs back. Roll tide old folk's rooms checked weeks. Mom sick five days insisted gets tested difficulty breathing two days ago. positive results came feeling lot better symptoms. good sign could potentially get worse? Completely agree, there's certain mindset person consider living lives outside consider top top. corner-office goals value see prestige holding certain position certain city. sensible.thing worked Spain. 90% wearing masks mandatory. 

Testing total numbers. China scale btw? Oh report total tests. supposed believe new deaths COVID country 1.44B people, right. talking like black thing lol, Americans colors experimented on, that's big reason many anti vaxxers, distrust government Yep we're riding second wave way hell... landlord greedy point 3 tenants (more 1 illegal) building; Changes lease whim (Also illegal) Invades privacy constantly, ignores messages wants hear, Little know leave, end losing tenants (about $2500 income month, pays mortgage) lawsuit brought numerous violations tenants rights. What's worse I've never good landlord since I've lived area do.  would probably get cheaper day like Monday winter. Maybe there’s Groupon... 🤣 Deaths lag cases, know that. Honestly far fetched! amount viruses randomly popped China eerily similar time COVID sketchy. Surprised big hitters spread. post source please? said, underlying full statement notion U.S. could stop testing confirmed cases would vanish.

Its captain obvious statements. ""If test, cases."" Nothing incorrect untrue disturbing rational people even considers scenario worth discussing. say all? entertained idea possible policy?

Its disturbing ""rational"" people can't see past trump hate see implying could, should, reason to. agreeing position bragging like bad countries allegedly still fully on-the-record complaining testing making administration look bad less testing would make look better.

He fully record, putting lot extra meaning whats going on. complaining others allegedly bad actors, rest bragging testing.

I'm concerned people hung it, look much effort putting it, can't extract intentions meaning word salad forgive point still you. hate guy, annoying put position defend him. know people absolutely love him, love love love conversation someone decided take trump context force spin it.

Transcript Trump bold Again, testing far advanced. **(bragging)** much bigger better country we're going cases. **(bragging)** We're always going cases. said, morning, that's probably downside good testing find lot cases countries, even test, have. **(Bragging much better testing, clamming people testing)** test, cases. **(Captain obvious, saying wont actually cases saying wont report test, directed alleged none-testing stop testing right now, we'd cases, any, do. **(Not suggesting stop, stating obvious test less show less cases, ""but do"" affirming test.)** We're level Mike going talk that's high, **(more bragging)** show cases countries far cases do. **(More throwing shade others allegedly testing)** talk it, testing, hand, good. **(more bragging)** find going, going, going to, take care it. **(more bragging)**

Seriously nothing saying underlying notion could stop testing, anything affirms opposite that. position position same, agree trump, sorry that's offensive. kinds dishonest attacks blinders going get reelected. PRC stopped subsidize steel production long ago. sell cheap simply unit cost cheaper produce quantity, also lax environmental rules.
Meanwhile, US subsidize farmers big agri corps suppress price. perfect example dumping WTO definition. Let’s forget whole “we need hear sides, intelligent design”. teaching religion science schools.

In science... [dead yea, agree China trying hard America Wait two weeks. actually ask discount. base rent already way market. get pretty good deal last year. NYC SFO represent 2% USA. 

Allow re-write headline accurately:

""Rents drop two overpriced, overcrowded cities, rest US mostly unaffected."" Yes, least Ohio people getting extra $600 per week top regularly calculated unemployment payments.  think we're going start seeing lot around country. live Dallas nothing prohibitively expensive here, I'm looking 500-600k decent house barely acre.

We're looking places like West Virginia right fun. Cheaper, better weather, effing beautiful. downside finding internet avoiding yokels, living DFW forever know handle them. I'm sorry, that's horrible. Yeah, agree fucking backwards. hope people learn this. told showed someone like, could happen COVID related. People fucking stupid. top 25% 75% poorer you, are, relatively speaking, rich. Anecdotal Utah I’ve noticed:

The elderly (Like 70+): Almost Always wearing masks 

20s-30s? Usually wearing masks 

Everyone between? masks think everywhere except Miami area started opening early May. heard one politician going fill 20,000 person indoor stadium campaign event weekend. Talk stupid! Canadian market like ""Hah, houses extra $200,000! rent going up, GL ever getting ahead life nerd!"" herd immunity. know virus spread, exhaled droplets, understand higher-risk scenarios transmissions, people close proximity indoors.

These states shunning mask wearing, social distancing, full steam ahead opening places people close proximity talk other, like restaurants bars.

Testing must keeping though, let quickly sort [Test / 1M pop see new hotspots rank terms testing. Florida 31st, Arizona 32nd, Texas 43rd.

So states least amount testing per capita, insist keeping places transmission likely open, refuse enforce cases even endorse masks, going better off.

How now? help im poor lil landlord change light bulbs buy new washing machine every years people give 1/3rd 1/2 paycheck every single month bought multiple properties helpppp

no get tenants drive nicer car me!!!! can't see im victim here!!!  You’re speaking media it’s monolith. It’s made many different perspectives. Sure, argue large portion paying much attention protests pandemic. However, part see reporters wearing masks acknowledging occurs pandemic. 

The choice many people seemingly made rights important staying home, lest disaster used take away liberties. say one media covers pandemic, many sources see acknowledge it’s still continuing, simultaneously give coverage, credible experts presented claimed protesting affect spread COVID19. OK, includes car accidents might get hurt also. 

I used WA state data BTW. love random encounters connections kinds people kinds places. said response someone asking case counts keep going up. Apparently mindset stop testing, goes away. Pneumonia deaths reported COVID, they're 500%. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ lot people realize property taxes go $100 year counties

Gotta get money dem programs nigguh. food contaminated??? get food? surprising. India still testing small percentage population. Number infections deaths must grossly underestimated. Hospitals must overwhelmed. 

Maybe divert government budget rupees healthcare? seems like many Indian doctors work countries. that? (rehtorical) think predicting large scale changes based virus last forever going far Well, Spain people put people wearing masks found “funny” people travelled masks on. would never think ever wearing one and, well, things changed lot quickly. hope people USA soon realise global effort means save thousands lives, allow safely reopen business. Here’s hoping! Exactly, makes wonder kids go back school eat lunch people around them. Well, yes, property also underwater soon. Yeah nearly us, well. could gone $130 originally lucked get $100 increase instead. Fuck Florida! Yeah eat one slice two slices much. Dallas now, rent skyrocketed past 5-10 yrs vibe right definitely reached portland already don’t worry you’ll good company [border recently opened immediate likely person asking it, June 9th. I’m gonna guess title article one year: “Mega corporations used pandemic prices buy property Manhattan charging exorbitant prices” wouldnt surprised people already virus recovered less likely wear mask. saw average takes 25-28 days infection death reported. takes weeks die, generally 5 days death report make statistics. 100 million across 35 mostly first world/western world countries. Scaled globally bet closer 300 million, maybe more.

And include *already* lost jobs, what, another 100 million plus? purpose Bc don't. Disney open til mid July. Maybe they're trying hit parks, still need reservations capacities cut. wanted expatriate NZ even *before* pandemic. want even more. hospitals seem PPE availability.

So much this. It’s infuriating little afterthought government media overwhelmingly make highest risk population. Thankfully that’s shifted somewhat since data came showing hard hit LTC facilities it’s still enough. 

At one point family members scouring stores businesses couldn’t get disinfectant hand sanitizer. going hospitals. could get case two time, isn’t even weeks worth pandemic. 

As PPE never stood chance first month. sewing masks makeshift filters reusing paper gowns multiple shifts. made face shields sheets plastic rubber bands. course testing nonexistent us unless could confirm case worker resident. 

This administration saying “spend whatever takes”. Didn’t matter. 

We somehow made without case measures feel like luck anything it’s yet. least facilities priority though, help. Okay yeah, youre right stupid didnt mention covid story protest trump rally story city official's concerns centrally organized rally held candidate office. 1-1 comparison cant made 2. youre right, virus shouldve beem mentioned protest story well. Unfortunately, *Idiocracy* paradox: wise people use knowledge subsumed overwhelmed vast herd *stupid* people. special insight situation. Everyone knew protests would lead increases spread virus. There's reason top comment saying obvious. I'm sure think ""yall"" is, consensus nothing consistent. 

I really seen anyone appreciable numbers saying otherwise. agree protests right dangerous, also understand comes police murdering people streets impunity, also critically important long overdue. people protesting police accountability risking lives freedom, freedom following sensible medical advice, missed haircuts, mask wearing, freedom literal murder, rape, theft people supposed protect serve. tragic many take streets middle pandemic, fearful them, I'm also grateful Yes I'd say $1.2M that. 

No places coordinated databases, know blood type/medication allergies, ask wheel unconscious body hospital door, another $1200 least get scene police shooting hospital door. hero society surely society would collapse without you.

And I'm sure example renting people want home applies majority people renting.

Thank goodness you! servicing house - various trades get called service issues house cost every year. Insurance costs increase also.

And it’s like landlord even needs “excuse” raise rent. thinks market rent higher he’s charging you, raise it. It’s house he’s running charity. Time start apartment hunting. fair, trend new cases seen overwhelmingly young people. me, makes sense cause people went back work state reopened. We’re talking people 45, nothing crazy. ""This *literally* oppression. totally understand blacks now."" ~ Karen think half record labels tech firms actually property management firms label app development component side, given extent they've tied capital residential property. Every downtown area visit filled empty commercial real estate festooned banners say CREATIVE OFFICES AVAILABLE creative offices buy houses condos work of! laughable! 

And KNOW high end construction ease rents elsewhere - one presentations argue new luxury highrises? one first selling points RAISE property values! RAISE property values LOWER rents time? impossible. 

I swear luxury apts fronts laundering money anyway build ten times rent never go simply need make money. *Laughs San Diegan* Denver long way go still  bar passing health inspections way low. ur boy? Oh wow Source without remember, lower prices stick around long would imagine. Since rent agreements lock year expect price jump back Corona 'cured' whatever say. huge testing surge, raw cases worst number look at... really dont get this?? wouldn’t able leave mom’s house? Darn  apartment Seattle rent reduced $3500 $2800 result huge point many people seem overlooking. wife nurse gets frustrated people make claim everything fine long numbers within capacity. hospitals staff run 90%-100% capacity prolonged periods time. wife ICU nurse weeks floor near max occupancy entire week. end week staff tired burnt worked. handle week two really bad healthcare workers continues months. 

Max capacity puts huge strain healthcare systems stays way prolonged period time. That's thing, though...*nobody ""crying wolf""*.

They said, ""if enact methods (a), (b), (c) getting control spread Coronavirus, *ThisBadSituation^tm* occur."" 

We things (a), (b), (c), lo behold, stayed curve. *It worked.* 

This tantamount paying car insurance, *sad* *weren't* t-boned car totaled. 

Sure, shitty cooped home, shortages (fake ones caused lack supply, greedy neighbors asses), Federal government follow economically incentivizing us keep shelter-in-place safe.

But worst case scenario occur reason give discredit experts--they wrong *because acted*. People see stress out, consider ignorant, willfully so. market efficient sometimes claimed, actually contingent people want property without needing deal problems come home ownership terms repairs, maintenance, etc - I'm sure we'd see ""concierge"" type services would gladly take fee handle administration. fact sort thing widespread means there's probably large group people afford property yet want deal trouble so. 

Because, yes, obviously country people can't afford $400 surprise bill, people can't afford house lol Hope get word out. Fast working. Took bronchial flare got quickly could long term risks. Hope people start taking prevention. Careful there. We've actually cool front temps way areas, people still sunbathing away. One clip invalidate things said recently would consider now.

Just choice going ruin country mean take *who warned would happen*. Interesting, thank sharing that! wonder maybe it.. much I've seen people say sick weeks slightly sick one day body ache low grade fever shortness breath prior slight cough afterwards. gone anywhere except walks outside hardly anyone around I'm still hesitant think was. Can't wait accurate antibody test! there's Spain mysterious drop cases/deaths right tourist season Ask Scarface. likely 7 8. big money stock compensation, make sense non-profit. happening 2018? case, many us interested even news publication trying ""do thinking me"" telling ""a simple yes no."" Many people like know reasons someone arrived particular conclusion. people back!

👏 👏 flush 👏 👏 toilet. 👏 it’s absolutely true. I’m conservative, wrong. Many people die suffer economic fallout covid. People can’t afford rent, put food table, support family. Y’all continue “economy bad” circle jerk want, economy way important think. It’s rich corporations stockbrokers. People go poverty, starve, go homeless, won’t afford medical bills, poop streets, die without strong economy. Please try look sides. Hahaha. guys losers...lol obviously living rock Indiana huge outbreak AIDS watch decided ignore it. thing that's going stop vaccine. That, herd immunity. maybe 5 days new, mine ~17 months old goes 2 2.5 days. home workout! inflation would minor. We're going 7-10% 3%. depends live. many places, still seller's market far buyers available listings. probably take long time flip way.

Recessions always result significant declines housing prices. Look graph grey columns recessions. line median sales price housing US. may notice really recent recession saw significant decline housing prices, probably crash caused bubble housing market (other recessions causes).

If '08 recession someone lived understand one might think *recession = housing market crash*. guaranteed. Turns selling buckets toilet paper haircuts!  problem ran was, living myself, enough supplies/access supplies pandemic... experienced symptoms told self-isolate tested came back negative. things like delivered groceries etc. long wait times. also ran something might food allergy avoid staple foods. would say, enough supplies, enough self-isolate problem. Since test came back negative, might still actually get covid-19 self-isolate again. Published 6/10/20 updated 6 days ago (6/11/20). 

Older news. see sides this. extra $600 week may provide disincentive find employment, letting expire severe consequences. hope ""middle ground"" found. guess it’s really millennial history, aids epidemic also bears mention. even then, peak AIDs deaths 42K per year. Less barrel oil you’re GOP. Party people fuck poor Congratulations Florida, it. ...please don’t ever invite salad.

:)  Thank you, think that’s I’m happy get really low point life there’s pandemic craziness happening, think I’ll alright!  Gonna call bs overwhelming trend protests peaceful, police start gassing downtown beating journalists reason all, things look violent. violence coming police.

So yeah, you’re partially right. right wing protestors stormed capital building arms, police stood peacefully. police reacted violence unarmed protestors demonstrated police violence.

🤔

Of course, you’re talking specifically protest Minnesota night killing, yeah lot property got destroyed. much different protests played out. Texas might surging cases, deaths still lagging:

 Texas remains one best states terms per capita deaths:

 absolutely zero evidence China’s numbers numbers coming part world.  Yeah, dumb headline. course gets upvoted. drive GA NC visit SO. There’s lake crossing border GA SC cross bridge every time make trip done 20+ times. never seen packed people past Memorial Day.

Same trip stopped get gas north part SC 85. wasn’t busy wasn’t dead either. Went use restroom saw maybe one two people wearing mask me. Got looks like crazy something smh...

I hoping stumbled upon rare situations seems maybe it’s 🙃 Open window possible leave ventilation fans on. 

Clorox Lysol disinfectant wipes? Bleach+water? guess alcohol 70% use too. 

Make sure wear gloves handling chemicals. I'd sure forget bad tenant 5 weeks passed. uptick hospitalizations even though cases going up. Abbott: it’s damn Dawson’s river kids...sleeping others beds! Fair enough.

Not gonna lie, believe two seconds sweat contain DNA. Googled it, right. TIL Lol wrong waited last possible moment look new apartment hoping rent prices would go down. Around here, never did. I'm moving family because, anything, they've gone up, can't afford place. Maybe next year dropped live alone like want. saying vulnerable. Im saying numbers US distorted people 65 affected due overall lack good healthcare. bring list weird unproven reasons wear mask, demand unbending scientific rigor change mind. see disconnect here?

The overwhelming consensus professional medical community facemasks provide benefits preventing covid spread. 

Your posture emotional one. many Americans died civil war?

It’s hard find solid numbers that; numbers I’ve found cumulative total Americans traitors. Fifteen restaurant/cafe/breweries listed. Man fully intend addicted weights rest life. quarantine finally got hip kettlebells great joints. want old bastard shuffling around walker 70, cannot happen. Weightlifting yoga baby. already happening. Thousands cars lining mornings food banks. USDA rushed 3 billion spending shore food bank spplies. Fucking sucks seeing stuff like girlfriend struggled hard last 3 years got masters. Rent hardest part pay 1250 month. Maybe I'm understanding account factor, 0.6x1.28 adjusted IFR 0.77 (assuming excess death result C-19)? False. Eastasia ally. always war Eurasia. Yeah, past landlords pushing 5% increases. people getting lease renewals sub 1% increases flat. bit pushback, could probably get flat, maybe even decrease depending cost size apartment.

News 11:00.  love optimism, haha. That'd def too! That’s good wonder it’s become rural.  People like make religion look like joke. could give people hope tell support tough times...but noooo doesn’t make money. significant differences sound criticism early response Chinese local government beginning pandemic conjecture number covid cases/death China conspiracy theories like virus leaked Chinese bio lab, etc. spite lack definitive proofs western governments, organizations, intelligence agencies whatsoever.

So using ""Chinese bots can't handle criticism"" deflect counter criticism towards weak arguments neither intelligent constructive. honey, unfathomable real ppl would also downvote ppl like u make u cry like little baby~ believe fucking governor scientific data? Holy shit delusional. I'm done. wear two, they're starting get bit natty. Honestly, learn factory farming think, already happened

Let alone small ways it\`s screwing us, like antibiotic resistance due regularly bulk adding antibiotics feed order compensate horrifically unsanitary conditions.

I don\`t think universal veganism answer - one, I\`m unable go vegan due health issues around digesting things like lentils. eating LESS meat, eating sustainable meat (lobster tuna, example), eating ethically raised meat (which, ethically raised local meat better environment quinoa shipped halfway across world) would lot good. here's latest chart cases/deaths Nevada:

""Hanoi’s aggressive response pandemic paid off. June 16, Vietnam, shares 1,400-km border China, recorded 334 confirmed Covid-19 cases remarkably, zero deaths, according World Health Organization. numbers seem credible.

I'm explaining philosophy. choose take it, cant control. even said free take different point view.

Yes wear masks - since prior requirement so. love God, don’t let trump see this. lack data yes, prior knowledge viruses leads believe come around real Fall. No. Reduce spread much possible keep hospitals overwhelmed. longer gone know, agree you. 

It's either that, we're going learn less susceptible population still getting infected roughly rate susceptible population, we're seeing rise either asymptomatic mildly symptomatic cases someone even realize they're sick. likely someone presymptomatic exhaling clouds airborne viral particles taking shit enclosed space portajohn. roids system, shocked gets 70s. death decade him. Funny thing probably cause SIGNIFICANTLY less infection daily virtue signal BLM protest Congratulations you, too. hope positive changes continue come way. headline makes seem like Covid makes younger. only... Christian relatives LOVE Jim Bakker buy stuff. they're 100% sure come also hate Trump allied Satan.

Not much use trying explain science them. bars use disposable cups, still using glasses put washer two seconds? way I'd drink glass several people used.

Also, genuinely don’t believe going sway someone still supports trump. 

Point regarding tribalism taken definitely weighed heavily moving forward. DC nation wide? one might point enormous effort made across society make driving safer, billions dollars spent safety driving. smash cars walls time study it, put airbags steering wheels, doors, pretty much everywhere think of. build engines crumple utterly sacrificed/destroyed crash. enormous book hundreds pages longs rules drive car. need register, need pass tests, need insurance, etc, etc, etc, etc.

People wear seatbelts driving, refuse wear mask stop virus transmission. Canada currently fish sell ya like fish got fish always ""record breaking"". guess one way put it.  guess things like often talked terms per 100,000 percents.   

I'm sure point comparing pandemic war anyway. Also take consideration length icu stays anywhere 7-28 days thats good Guys himself, state art gym home.

Now, THAT'S information! Ah, real China sick liberal lies. He's trying ""steal everything nailed down"". He's also trying steal things nailed down, even nails themselves. problem follow statements opinions based know current situation, cherrypick statements, look like contradict eachother.

His point always consistently same.

1. Herd immunity main goal, slowing spread hospitals handle is.
2. level herd immunity could reached (positive) consequence since vaccine far away.
3. end vaccines necessary eradicate disease. Insurance special programs pay it. pay 15 lab tests. Far ‘vaccine’. I'll definitely take also deployed large scale China itself.

How think number calculated?

Infected ofc known positive tested number, excluding unknown cases.

That official numbers yesterdays Lagebericht RKI. First page, table top.

if super old dying matter. number like 0.7% beginning people countries suspected cheating undercounting. fact simply time young people infected Germany. fact high shows said manage keep care homes e.g.
We manage protect elder population, ofc lacked protective material, failure.
And why? nobody took warnings previous pandemic reports serious kind stuff would crucial.
At moment politics talks success. Well, relative. less failure neighbor countries. want see real success, look Vietnam. Larger population, closer links China. Amazing death rate. Mongolia.

So pandemic drill, think react better next one might less forgiving. okish, good. Yeah real funny seeing right wing ""pro-life"" Demand Haircut republicans holding signs saying Body Choice!

Republicans biggest hypocrites world!  Hopefully spread further. New Zealand good job Arden definitely taking matter seriously, leader should.

Also, excessive sense personal space hurt times. Even though may bad intentions, masks actually protect others. Sneeze cough valved n95. Nothing coming would cloth mask.

Mm, think so. Countries virus widespread also highest number fact opinion vaccines type cure.

Yes, course. would disagree? would admit actual health related issue. would mean would need stop stealing bail-out package actually something virus spread. think Arnold heart problems years weight training. Ohhhhhh shut fuck god sake think simpler explanation.

You stop letting biased media source information topic, instead go volunteer actually make difference. What??? telling america country world?? Sounds like con man would say. problem message lost, people understood need flatten curve. message even people werent afraid catching virus could understand, understand needed stay inside. clear, trying flatten more? trying simply control spread, arent moment even things opening back up? Increases expected havent heard much massive surges like beginning. point isnt clear unifying goal anymore.

Also (in US), protests royally fucked up. Large groups people gathering extended periods time, also fact news dedicating coverage caused people forget virus. Consider two cases: double every 10 days double every 2 days. exponential, one waaaaaay worse other. exponential equations same. whiteness death cult dilemma NBA restarts, Ref coach found contracted virus ? badly quarantining team player derail make institution sport look like mockery ?

The US worse China fighting virus. Stop stupid. proof want show literally everything come China fiction? want compare level healthcare systems 1st world country China, many whose regions borderline Africa poor decade ago? even talking US Netherlands, erhabs best healthcare systems world. Netherlands recorded deaths China population 16 million. 

China largest country world population sick unsanitary conditions made virus first place. enough show bad actual outbreak is. Cinese party confirms 5000 deaths fully certain 50,000 would bet literally whole life 50,000 lowest end spectrum. 500,000 would begin sound right.

So stop listing Chinese numbers all. fake, fiction mean shit all, really cared country fighting virus well heed advice. Look Western countries free medias shown us virus stopped. Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, etc.

Masks primarily help people getting infected.

Depending design material mask, limited filtration thus protect little too.

To protective effect, masks filter viruses, reduce transmission droplets.

But better avoid around people, wash hands lot, disinfect surfaces get touched lot. Anecdotally well know tested positive little symptoms, back work, exercising, living usual within week so. mean won’t see hear two weeks. Now’s time Health Experts. Shut he’s quarantine.

Landlords even change lightbulbs. lease specifically states need purchase light bulb one goes charged end tenancy. Yep! Upstate open Americans like me: *Abattoir = Meat Plant* consider Florida states hot zones, warn going areas? I'm 40 even though I'm frantic yet, I've thought it. Living studio 1600/month south SUCKS agree. $15/hr joke human being.  Same, 15-month increase. jumped that. Nothing see here. 3 months, 5000 deaths, cases per million EU countries (with low density time prepare) still speak lockdowns like people would easily decide shut down. Like FORCED it.

Norway worse sweden beginning. pointing strategy good got ""still better norway answer"".
Then said come netherlands... worse. france. italy.

It growing growing months everybody said test more. Nope. Tests useless.
At first herd immunity. officially weeks obsession percentage people stockholm got virus. would get 50% population infected april. 2 weeks after. 2 weeks after. 2 months gave up.

There reports elderly admitted ICU. told fake news. went public.

Data lags since beginning. Testing 100k week since 6 weeks ago. Failed deliver.

People symptoms tested since week ago. told tests useless (when failed deliver).

There little save here. Media media. Thanks getting stuck head think they're giving idea cost vs space, necessarily feasibility. Probably.  fuckin guy thinks he’s gonna sick 10 days hahah good metric estimate potential range look countries' deaths/million pop. U.S. 362 right now, UK high end 621, France, Spain, Italy 450-580.

The U.S. averaging ~800 deaths/day, assuming lands France did, would 330M*450 = 148,500 dead. 

To get end August (75 days) would require ~380/day, unless get things control, France-like scenario seems pretty optimistic.

If maintain 800/day end 180,000 550/M territory, slightly better Italy. 

205k deaths would put U.S. par UK 620/M; hitting 200k would require ~1050/day.

If vaccine treatment pan out, estimate fatality rate 0.1% 85% U.S. pop eventually gets it, that'd 280k dead. Millenials ""stop confusing us Gen Z. us fucking 40s."" Correct, symptoms dont get bad enough go hospital another eight days average, hence: two weeks worst...  Huh? get information??

I’ve never heard rumor Japan work today tried discussing co-worker virus, messaged Mayor ask people wearing masks. co-worker told wearing mask dangerous wearing one, breathing carbon monoxide exhale prolonged exposure thing damaging brain cells.. true? so, proceed future? tend work 6+ hours day, generally take mask break room outside front building carry umbrellas around know. Surprised he's blaming people California. would make appear ""weak."" He's done little dispel cult's *I AIN'T WEARIN' MASK, GOTS MUH RIGHTS* narrative they're desperate keep. *he* wears one, it'll shatter world.

Seriously? Also dont fart public spaces. can't figure towers antenna wires know causes 5G pandemic. 

Right. 

It clear dealing people less stellar intellect. people die every day.

You're good math Trump. This. flu, appears function 'seasons'. fuck around months go away. *still spreading*, people irresponsible fucking idiots. not? masks help one actually make Acceptable catching virus. right. cost restaurants. Government really messed up.

Should kept everything closed.  Florida California

Damn homie, Imma pour one you. RIP According governor Texas darn kids. two overseas, NZ Sweden could lockdown country like many countries would violate basic freedoms protected constitution. main goal Swedish strategy (I think?) get people stay home voluntary basis ensure healthcare system could handle number infected patients virus hit. 
We built two big field hospitals Gothenburg Stockholm prepared big venues function extra emergency hospitals. never used hospitals around country could handle corona cases without going capacity. 

And there's still much know virus, early say Swedish strategy failure. true many infected dead Norway, Denmark Finland, still bad Belgium GB instance. 

Hopefully effective treatment within month two working vaccine within eight month so. would even super happy Trump right virus goes away like miracle... :) Uh, whole post? chucking.


I extreme gripping headache fatigue, sweats and. stomach upsets march intermittently ever since then. 

I wonder continuing stomach problems result electoral college. Direct quote friend Texas: ""Dude everything fine. Everything open open.""

Just things open, mean virus exist. mentality seeing across country right now.

Economically, longer force businesses closed. businesses employees cannot survive without stimulus checks. can't provided relief, need option open, apparently people stupid exercise caution think means okay go bar 15 friends. position lens ""everyone getting eventually"" makes points seem distasteful viewed different scope palatable.


This asked repeatedly clearly defined solution was... 70% need get it, best give healthiest 70%. tens thousands protesters spreading virus? movie called number people would like get tired apocalypse. Like imagine zombie movie showed people picket signs calling zombies liberal plot ruin economy. Locals happy tourists! Also, Italy safer many countries right tourists coming careful respect rules don’t see would consider douches. Thoughts prayers immigrants exposed brother Minneapolis said people driving go bars. obviously Wisconsin Coronavirus bad. Especially drunk. Anything go wrong go wrong, let absolute dumbass complain things go wrong least mortality much lower. Reopen America there's stuff talk about. Lol reads like Jon Oliver Spain, 90% wearing masks even mandatory. might something.to numbers. They're rare, scrolled 10 newest responses right half negative, small group saw:

* Hope join soon
* Oh, thought lover
* Sorry loss, father hell

These people disgusting. Someone doesn’t know kickbacks Docs get pushing certain drugs go ahead read Chemo Treatment profits 

This minority issue regards numbers but... read went church day first time since lockdown white suburban Oklahoma town, wore mask, like everywhere. Walked main auditorium, SINGLE PERSON wearing one. Somehow made feel like idiot one wearing one. Everyone giving weird looks, like alien. Never felt weird life. Contact Tracing vs App

Contract tracing better.

Human beat machine  I'm sorry, analysis shallow. link leads dead page. WHO's information page masks. paper linked Technical Guidance, say scientific paper written, yet *still* recommends wearing masks page 7 document.

Just one submitted published peer-reviewed study mean can't take steps protect around you. must nearly impossible create document since researchers would way making sure person compliant tracking potential exposure activities little margin error. published paper mean idea unsound. worries there’s Lysol injection people. /s fair, working mask sounds awful, especially cardio.

Really, gyms shouldn’t open. Went grocery store yesterday. Maybe 1 every 10 persons wearing mask. live major city US. People fucking stupid. grocery stores too. area's credit, people saw wearing masks. people saw maskless ignoring social distancing/one way aisles old white men. NWA resident maybe saw 30% people wear masks public today, blows mind  ""*They love shuffle words around.*""  GOP convention moving Jacksonville way Desantis closing anything down. Phase 3 alone like 18 mo 2 yrs? betting short term protection plus significant adverse effects. like wife left misogynistic behavior. live Rome reopening strictly mandated masks distancing. restaurants everyone wears masks except patrons seated table. Tables widely spaced accept outdoor seating. feel pretty safe. never _completely_ safe. Wealthiest country history human civilization, everybody. get back drive pair gloves cross contaminating every single thing touched.

Well, glove thing bad, hard get SARS-CoV-2 infection surfaces.

Yea, virus survive 72 hours optimal lab conditions. conditions included optimal population, optimal surface, environmental factors air currents, temperature humidity changes, UV light, etc.

In real world... impossible difficult. would need 1) rich population virus land surface, 2) population survive large amounts, 3) sufficient amount population must get human.

It much easier virus enter another human directly inside aerosol droplets.

The mask thing main thing paid attention to. Elon musk things advance society civilization, need money . lol . must poor Lol many upvotes saying something ridiculous “120k people die every day” ? literally saw woman Target face shield mask chin. Well, Harvard qualified Fox News MAGA supporters asinine opinions? peer reviewed research, there's virtually sign outdoor transmission persistent source outbreaks. Even touching surfaces inferred contact traced outbreaks little transmission since virus needs enter respiratory tract significant viral load. single touch would have, say, 1,000 viral particles youd shove hand throat fingers nose infect yourself. touching anything else. assuming infected person hocked lugey ball.

For instance, contact traced outbreak study office South Korea, single person building contracted virus via elevator shared surfaces. time + exposure airborne vital particles sitting close proximity talking Didn’t hear? Masks antifa, terrorists, virtue signaling politicians, sex workers, sadomasochists, people hate 1A. Yeah Sinovac news got attention maybe (which similar) stole thunder little. Sinopharm Sinovac probably confused people too. Also, Operation Warspeed decided use inactivated virus vaccines Chinese vaccines hard wear mask? druthers, I'd wear respirator. problem A: I'd look creepy, B: protects me, others.

A mask hard. uncomfortable. wear one every time I'm out. wear one day work. minor pleasantry keep others getting sick happen sick.

If acceptable, I'd wear plague doctor suit kept poor bastard dying. Illan Omar's dad died Covid. like her. dad die. Someone wear mask somewhere. Someone careful. careful. That's do. Canadians can’t drive u.s? valid green card? 

I’m asking fiancé drove Canada mom elderly M.S. I’m sure come back. Also, don’t think Canada let I’m Texas even though haven’t left house 3 months 😢 compared ~5% funny Iranian device heard months ago. That's good question regarding came June. live alone I've quarantined underlying health issues. grocery store since early March. isolated really hard me. think month ago asking ""How long this? able indefinitely? "". guess based everything reading/watching June 2021 seemed realistic vaccine anytime year. So, set date coping tool. I've telling myself, ""You June 2021"" looking beyond that. year although challenging, felt do-able me. coping tool came survival.

So sorry hear business financial stress under. hope, somehow, someway, things work you. lot money get by. Every food company claims advanced fast cold chain transport fresh meat somewhere somewhere keeps fresh. slogan salmon! sea dining table 48 hours!

&amp;#x200B;

So virus. I’m idiot general, parent large venue business. March called financial advisor told pull money. said crazy. Never question parent owns large venue dependent business pandemic! Fuck. waited lost 25% savings one transaction. Add income least year, maybe 2. feel alone everyone know making full salary working 2 hours day. upset school next year though. Shoot me. Would trump tell us positive covid test? Assuming would live it. Man, hurricane season hits snows start fall, can’t imagine challenging get simple 911 services people sick coronavirus.   remember fellow redditor (I believe Hungary E europe) chatting idea using interference diffraction grating detect viral particles. wonder method use here?

Personally thought would impossible engineer. guys pulled I'm awe. Sadly lost much time debating whether lockdown not. half-assed quarantine lasted long effective enough. People can't stay home anymore 3 months lot brazilians informal sector need work day want eat night.

I think worst thing could happened making fight coronavirus political debate. started reopening even harder tell people lock things get even worse. weeks ago, affected cities state capitals virus reached south. virus spread everywhere, smaller cities south. good news seems Manaus, first state hit hardest months ago, seems better. Anne Frank family spent two whole years attic w/e, yet everyone days bitching far less restrictive Coronavirus guidelines.

edit: word Amazing levels misinformation sprinkled half truths. Propaganda finest, right here. Take note don’t need show symptoms transmit. quote WHO, keep mind CDC says false. 

Lmfao imagine believing incompetent agency like CDC, illiterate enough understand statement. What's difference asymptomatic presymptomatic? Nothing according Trump defunded making claim back January disease wasn’t transmit-able people

No. Trump wants defund feels Americans benefitting proportionally. Plus misquoting statement obvious wrote disingenuous. I'm sure earned top marks propaganda classes half truth though, congrats, guess?  Elon musk 5000x credentials do. Lmao. typing uncle's basement Protesters gathering thousands social distancing made pretty fking clear. done it. wish like that, people assaulted wearing mask *”Muh feelings hurt! “*

Facts don’t care feelings, Karen! They've tested, Einsteen. ""Medical experts say recent spike COVID-19 cases Memphis Shelby County shows people following social distancing guidelines wearing masks.""

Social distancing complete non factor matter. Masks stolen many hospitals itself. than, shops would next thing. Eitherway, probably better ways handling this, screwed up. also blames condition lawn meddling mystery-solving adventures. 10 10? Good fucking grief.  Fuck prednisone real. makes rage hungry unable sleep. drowning lung fluids equally bad. Thought u
Bug 💘  Fauci guy one job. keeps messing up. Region poor health care ability report infection rates...


So, America? I'm kidding -- caught flat-footed, widespread testing available, people avoid going see doctors, much less hospital, avoid costs risk bankruptcy, doubly huge particularly vulnerable part population -- urban poor, homeless. first wave even over. Wonder would let first. would quarantine month! know Murphy's Law is...? right. tests available also afford fixate nearly half deaths nursing homes half 70? Maybe government actually protect vulnerable come actual long term plan instead shaming 20 somethings wanting grab beer.  never face question directly That's part problem. People western world used seeing people wearing mask. looks weird scary them.

However, begin root mask culture west well, things get easier. people trendsetters.

I suppose carrying umbrella looked really weird others beginning well.

For East Asian people, wearing mask natural carrying umbrella westeners. i'm rooting corona point -- people got go would imply first wave ever ends. Idk man. seen studies it, seen many reports outbreaks job sites. may lack hand washing stations, idk. may spreading way all, suspected SARS spread fecal route. Well. It’s like health authorities around world didn’t try. stupid governments elected stupid people stupid things, expect stupid consequences. Sorry affected stupidity. need quit. results investigation already in. Guilty. wife’s pandemic much alarm 40 cases. Meanwhile, US shrugs 20,000 new cases goes back normal... too. I've left house little groceries since St Patrick's day. Everyone hates it, compliance pretty decent. 

The one thing social scientists keep pointing indicator success social distancing trust government officials government generally. think that's America dropped ball. There's trust government all, political polarization insane. even making sense anymore. I'm done. good one. We're paying normal extortionate shipping costs plebs *health care worker*

also wonder employees got tested. go sewers get tested virus? “Add web app home screen” &lt;image app L including china, US think that's exaggeration. We're seeing *very* vocal minority. ""Govenor, think re-opening increased cases?""

""Noooooo, darn millenials!"" Thoughts n prayers. Congrats. get 10 condescending scale. solved making masks mandatory governors bunch morons. already best possible drug candidate covid-19 interestingly widely used ie Ivermectine safe dosage covid must 5x usual dosage 200µg/Kg parasitic infections usualy covid range 50-100mg daily full effect. It’s kind Jim Jones thing: dare try deviate group’s self-destructive tendencies.  Southeast, rural Oregon conservative get, relative Oregon’s “liberalness.” rednecks overtook wildlife refuge years ago came Idaho border two states crossbreed rednecks continually right there. 

So course church ignored governments directives break. happy die standing Government reason. rescinded 3,2,1... answer picture: non Orange Orffice, front centre picture havent paying attention think US runs Australia. shocked world Australia would first one considering hard CCP thumb.

And many, many nations havent supported probe yet. fixation US obsessive. 200k deaths minimum US. May odds ever favor. ever wanted know what's happening Florida contained in[ article labeled ""wearing protective masks"". Well said politicians. Plenty leaders Europe, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, places handled quite admirably.  need kill vulnerable like real man!  Given 40 50 percent COVID deaths nursing homes, I’m sure governments focused young people doing. Maybe spent effort protecting vulnerable people less effort keeping 20 somethings grabbing beer we’d better place. passed city council unanimously! seems like pretty well rounded set requirements, there's budget set aside distribute free masks, well help guide businesses promote awareness.

However, City Attorney (who less official lawyer City Council) says Arkansas state government wanted to, probably challenge they'd probably win. City council members say realize possibility, hoping Arkansas state government would take account urgency situation leave alone. #perniciousaf know lot people Chattanooga use public transit since went UTC (but don’t know true people Knoxville) might also play factor, think? you’re right it’s inconsistently odd case. 

From I’ve heard anecdotally (family friends back home) it’s really difficult. mom dental assistant she’s one wearing correct PPE seeing patients. She’s mess. I’ve told family time start hyper vigilant since cases skyrocketing. think time indoors AC use that's exacerbating anti-mask, open-prematurely situation. matter cases, DEATHS matters people. Til then, whatever them. Lack wear masks. one reject it

and come on, really believe Aussie made move themselves? really believe nothing related master? DeSantis good. causing spread? Spring break didn’t cause outbreak rise infections, happened did? hope people realize choices make actually make difference. also jump airplane without parachute say God decide whether u'll live.. Though everyone pretty sure outcome choice be. That's stupidity. point, I'll heavily consider it. dead body nothing can't worse active destruction. hope. Taiwan everyone still wearing masks taking temps even though 5 cases left, negative pressure isolation chambers hospitals, local case 2 3 months. There's literally threat public safety time people still comfortable erring side caution. seeing uniquely American problem, least Western problem. make timeline, virus makes timeline.

- Anthony Fauci Neither richest country world largest economy and, country mile, biggest miliary. 

Yet money tiny viral particles... healthcare... safety net. 

Ask again, Presidential candidates news people... ""But pay it?!??!"" question Warren answered dozens times yet, seem realize always money. click heels three times say, ""There's place like Corona."" Sometimes feel like living fever dream b-movie ‘death race 2000’. likely allowed golf course. trying figure timing stuffed, live really seasons, mild rainy, mild dry, warm fires lol apply logic perspective others. would protecting them. Maybe trick virus. Inverse herd immunity something. Completely overwhelm virus presence.
/s WWE think even tested anyone,not roster, fans. took temp let people average temperature go anyway. brought outside fans, told wear masks, etc. 


AEW meanwhile let employees tested everyone day, test see currently plus antibody test see antibodies.

AEW good fun havent watched. reminds best parts old original ecw prime WCW. difference claiming herd immunity slow virus (total?) herd immunity reached without vaccine. answer question.

And, well claim free open you? highlight dumb people are, Batman literally covers entire face EXCEPT mouth basically opposite, even fail attempt make fun you. College terms start ... given choice cleaning cleaning, ill take cleaning.  yes, mindset issue well. US what?

This probe nothing US. initiated Australia. Texas we're trying hardest biggest show up. give us couple weeks. We'll burning em piles behind schools. I'm putting money effective drug treatment therapies vaccine.  didnt realize would presiding investigation.

I'll put 2 weeks boss. big news! lockdown bought us time what's really coming. article also discusses Europe, responses similar. want go football game - DENIED

I want go church - DENIED

I want go park - DENIED

I want go visit sick grandma - DENIED

I want go crazy dangerous anti-American protest looting - APPROVED

Who stupid ones again? 🤦‍♂️ 25% eligible voters advice would much effective skipped whole virus part said ""flushing aerosolizes shit"" Bring welders! still big deal you. could one unlucky ones get permanently disabled it. Otherwise healthy people getting severe scarring lungs needing long transplants. one 100% safe. odds better could still big deal, lottery want win. good wearing mask. too. everything make others safe not? capability help should. Especially something simple washing hands, wearing mask keeping distance. replace ""120k"" ""lots of"" get there. Yeah, little dash ""whatever, China"", opinion also we've basically already known Sinovac candidate passed phase II. Phase III planned take place Brazil - cross fingers results.

Personally, think great three promising vaccine candidates one, Chadox one, Modena's. would incredible could roll one three year end.

As completely tangential aside though... either Chadox Sinovac candidates first market, never want hear ""but innovation!"" excuse high American drug prices ever again. universities SOEs deliver results... lack masks. annoying living Alabama right now. Constantly stared wearing mask, questioned wearing mask, made fun of. keep missing things hate also rather enjoy life, sheltered currently is. trips see around 20% people wearing masks, rest living life like nothing happened. gonna people want share traveling together tubes days days. Especially since people using probably high risk groups. Well yes should, fact containment isn’t realistic point US, still China. good explanation, please explain US Thats dumb, batmans mask doesnt cover mouth all. terrorist. anybody got fined posting stuffs Nguyen Quang Thuan fined libel spreading misinformation.

That's probably NY NJ really well now. They're behaving good weather outside. states listed parentheses exceptions? They're top ten deaths per capita NY #1, NJ #2, #4, IL #8, PA #9 Washington, DC #6 count since state IL PA would one spot lower (still top 10 either way). 2.2 million projection nothing likely states taking seriously, even briefly, stemmed tide when/if takes again, launch point many people currently infected time lower. 

If states supposed exceptions, deaths per capita can't go (unless zombie apocalypse occurs) means ""improve"" standing states worse right now. difference deaths per capita even NY (#1) PA (#9) threefold perspective going get really bad lot places NY/NJ/MA drop spot two (and even may expense 1 2 states instead entirely different state).

I've worked office Karens. That's happened daily basis, lol. concept wave misleading confusing. It’s like discrete individual separate onslaughts like castle siege. virus stays within community varies speed spreads one person another. 

A good analogy we’re Olympic torch bearers. carry unlit torch everywhere go. flame represents COVID19.  don’t shield torch say facemask, someone infected - lit torch - could accidentally transfer flame onto torch light it. 

Some us become aware torch lit. develop symptoms within days suffer.  us carry torches filled methanol fuel flame invisible. Asymptomatic carriers thing. Presymptomatic also means we’re lit haven’t yet noticed fire.  

The socialize get close one another, torches light. torches eventually go - people recover die (in small numbers - you’re old, poor health, predisposition severe reactions immune system). 

This process continuous uninterrupted. 

It could end two weeks Covid could disappear - that’s BIG - actually locked down. real lockdown. Everyone stays home 14 days. coming out. take food. deliveries. human contact outside immediate household. keep food supply home. 

By infected people develop symptoms able recover home symptoms aren’t severe, go hospital are. 

But society is. live porous social network travels, visits, shops, eats food prepared others, make exceptions families friends. end millions overlapping sets social networks touching passing flame virus, keeping alive feeding new hosts. 

That’s real wave. It’s one continuous fire grows contracts. flatten curve best we’re failing reopening. 

Even among precautious, limited available protection. use N95 masks meltblown polypropylene block 95% 30-micron size microdroplets (you don’t need filter virus sized particle - water microdroplets ride on).  Cotton fabrics filter 2-8% microdroplets. (Source: ). far shields go, stuck 19th century technology better job rationing makes unavailable. 

We always first wave. talk second wave really semantic poetic license. Ok. I'll leave one final thought. Please research *human reaction to* previous pandemics. saying it'll change perspective food thought. think seeing general intelligence vs specialized intelligence. Sad fact: general intelligence rarely taught can't learned school. kind intelligence involves critical thinking people obtain raised properly. Right?? hell managing ignore intense rise cases deaths decide pandemic somehow want be? COURSE want over... pretending exist getting worse going anything make continue even longer. They're extending thing they're trying get rid ignorance sheer will. guys gonna go watch jacked, sweaty, almost naked men pretend fight other? flabbergasting many idiots make policy. South, God's Waiting Room. Yeah ignoring virus real good idea. dramatic lmao It’s actually, statistically, crazier none asymptomatic. patients ventilators, cut risk death 40% 28%.   
For patients needing oxygen, cut risk death 25% 20%    

Nice see something positive.        
The numbers still frightening. Mind ask state? Quite honestly, would happily give life child’s future. shows easy slide way back started. That's true either. H1N1 faded vaccine came whatever reason. Sars. MERS.  


Personally, hope vaccine fall early winter. ease restrictions allow all, cases grow herd immunity appropriate R0. equation H0=1-1/RO.  


So even moderate social distancing cuts R0 2.8-4 (baseline) 1.1, society need get 9 percent infected virus die out. 

And that's partly virus dying quickly East coast. reached full herd immunity, enough given restrictions social distancing. Geez, answer? Throw out, wash it? (Or boil it, LOL.)  
That spectacularly lazy, holy shit. mean 'too bad' care many people personally willing kill go outside argument logical fallacy. reason death rate low took steps prevent it. That's like knowing city going bombed, building bomb shelter, coming saying look none us died build bomb shelter? Notwithstanding opinion likely reflect this, strictly speaking, government refer executive/presidency. RUMO AO HEXA, PORRA!!! really good question. seems significant evidence early wave hit nursing home residents recently higher rate general population. numbers this? Seriously. traumatic damaging health. going take care yourself, bullied (or yelled like pleasant Dr.) someone realized med school lot conditions thought going cure cure meds ineffective for. could least honest patients maybe give PTSD process getting diagnosis suggesting patient nuts Dr. solution? definitely want US, UK Brazil~ something between. r/freefolk kneel. thanks. tie scarf around face. toss balaclava. also stay home much possible unlike lot people high risk jobs spend free time bars getting drunk. It’s circle don’t intend participate in. ...you know wear special masks right? people wearing surgical masks bandanas shit. Surgical masks designed stop wearer inhaling shit. even healthcare? Surgical masks help slow/stop spread, collective. benefit anyone person self-protection negligible. thought volunteered tribute months ago keep Trump office...  BATENDO RECORDES!!! understand protestors position taking *only* health risk, simultaneously taking public health ransom situation? Respectfully. selling hope want make people fearful. answer. Twice bad *the worst* regular flu years. flu ranges (IIRC) 24k 60k *estimated* deaths (and usually thousand recorded), versus current 110k+ *recorded* deaths (not including estimates). Find map banner real hospital locations Arizona 
And kind figure implying serious, stating comparing Spanish Flu reasonable, argument stands. remarks ""offensiveness"", ""loved ones"" also irrelevant point. almost like telling people masks work well propaganda talking point keep virus going longer destabilize US...  Good people suck needs less them. addition strong individualism US, compliance also difficult point, relative Italy, many areas hit hard. California \~65 deaths covid day (at constant rate) - that's bad flu season. Numbers even lower Texas, albeit increasing.

Basically point relatively little restrictions still place, ""meh"" attitude developed. Meanwhile PM New Zealand blaming system calling unacceptable failure **2** new cases released quarantine early turning whole process new hands happen again.

But yeah, lets put blame citizens know instructions follow anything we've told fragmented, politicized, changes every single day.

'Murica....

\*googles would take immigrate NZ\* curve trending so... Thank you. Unfortunately lot support family members also extremely religious-- bad him, firmly believe there's thing much religion. mom &amp; ones trying bring around reasonable stances. feels like uphill battle, we're outnumbered. stay low everyone else going catch up. Florida, Texas, Arizona brink disaster saw here, New Yorker tell first hand really depends are. California, way Court issue summons right case relates violence, threats violence public health safety. words, unlawful detainer prior COVID-19 outbreak, still evicted. not, new case can't start. Look ignore virus, go away. /s (in case wasn’t obvious.) Hopefully bunch superspreader events protests, sort events protests, going see bunch April New York States United States would even worse April, instead states like New York, New Jersey Michigan getting it, going see many states get once.  cares? flattened curve time reopen. deal never zero infections zero deaths. That's unrealistic. I'm skeptical they'll lock down. Many seem OK people dying street hallways. literally deaths UK(where live) US(where op lives) feel better attack small country like Sweden. Can't second wave first one never ended. mask needs straw hole. Lol Count masks like.  Reminds good article pointed military generational living always norm. It’s last couple centuries nuclear family idea got promoted healthy normal. Mostly fit industrialization, creating mobile work force greater consumer needs. I'm talking long term rather short term, independent virus. figures post today June 17.... post +2,392 Arizona yesterday (can refer post history)  joke, [Bakker sued Arkansas wrong. 2 people. Please stop posting this. Sure, others aren’t going responsible, gym isn’t enforcing it, he’s making statement public health. pandemic, protections strong everyone complying. feet showing thinks people think they’re exceptional without cause. taken deaths past five Wednesdays? Highest May 20th according chart (lockdown lifted May 15th, correlation re-opening). 

And least amount deaths comes today, June 17th, 30+ days re-opening. 

I'm genuinely asking data interpreted know interpret - firm position anything, flip flop issues based whoever whispered ears recently
 
- getting rid experts around would tell harsh truth instead replacing yes men report everything rosy

- rampant anti-intellectualism

Are Chinese describing Trump CCP? miss friends dearly, one 3 kids another gf nurse, sake safety mine video call play video games call other. Idk people can’t pick phone conversation Lol you’re idiot, I’m sure child rapist much fit office. You’re right. That’s joke Middle ground tell lazy unemployed people start looking job mean uncomfortable, damn people, put fucking masks. girlfriend still insistent thinks going vacation Universal Studios September. 

Yeah, no. bite lip there's way travelling shit show like state. seems like far mostly really expensive places big cities.

I moving months living big city really expensive place see prices make reconsider life choices really cannot go again, hopefully everything put place prevent Education busted country decades. think parents got passed on? textbooks teach Civil War War Northern Aggression pretend racism ended MLK took peaceful walk. Native Americans Pilgrims didn’t get along first sad everything fine. 

It’s fault individual teachers, no. they’re underpaid overburdened expected teach standardized tests, critical thinking. 

We almost entirely removed art music curriculum, what’s left grossly underfunded available everyone. Art crucial developing critical thinking empathy. 

Add disinformation that’s allowed pass news country, blaring 24/7 every electronic device, you’ve got recipe ignorance hate.

People didn’t become way overnight. still bit early. Spikes taking month, two weeks.

I suspect nature superspreaders. Infections scene low, superspreaders get infected go back communities infect them, secondary rise precipitous. getting beer ryopus? treat Many elderly dying already nursing homes hospice - homes got cleaned sold years ago. Sounds like need better job. Easier said done. get better job pov change. people getting used COVID 19, become desensitzed it, decided ignore it? know leadership's shitty way going helped either. feel you. lot problems organized religion too. used hardcore outspoken Atheist. saw side it. I’ve met lot really great religious people volunteered jail; unpaid members churches never tried recruit us ask donations. lot us excuse get range, still good experience actually helped parole. that, vowed keep open mind. you’re right, look high enough religious organization you’ll find money grabbers criminals. You’ll enjoy mean, want lose much consumer spending that’s holding Stock Market right election... implausible think, maybe, *maybe* Italy seeing *some* benefit amount immunity there? “It’s like I’m coming time!” Trump coming AZ 23rd month. Ducey holding wants get pat head papa. 

Remember vote coming election cycle, Arizona. sarcasm? took 30k+ deaths get point NYS consider success? whatever EU work. Duh. don’t think it’s question effectiveness risk assessment. don’t pay take risks. get paid take risks. won’t pay take risks. pay car without airbags? consumers understand value judgment making, choose wallets.

But online MBA program that’s effectively irl program. fine. great fine. took lot less time effort in-person classes wasn’t forced quit job.

Also probably wasn’t great student. kept arguing time inventory practices stupid made entire system susceptible sort shipping delays caused mass death event. said crazy. Gave C’s. one guy bike path morning yelling people stay home wear mask fact home mask Dude, same. strait party fridays friends online. We’ve even played beer pong video chat works great. miss opportunities chat random ladies tho ☹️  home? Sure!

At factory/restaurant/market? Maybe not. work isn’t isolated home alone. 

She may socialized chosen friends months, hasn’t sitting corner room human interaction. agree people allowed travel — saying “deal it” someone allowed visit dying family member distasteful. really hope you’re spewing around IRL too. dunk bleach solution wearing gloves. Also, money technically plastic paper though still call (Canada).  Yeah, truly believes young people following health ""guidelines,"" turn guidelines requirements. NYC requires masks, several cities. think three factors affecting this.

First exactly say. serious take longer recover compared somebody found asymptomatic mass screenings somebody close contact mild symptoms.

Second number infected declining time goes less people recover less people got infected.

Third regions report ""fake recoveries"". Meaning count recovered also people still infected. procedure two lists: clinical viral recoveries. first needed hospitalization show symptoms clinical point view recovered. second two successive negative swabs 24 hour distance.
When communicate data aggregate two. happens patients show symptoms added clinical recoveries 2 weeks 2 negative swabs removed first list put second.
Today region reported 20 new recoveries 16 LESS clinical recoveries 36 viral recoveries. curious - coastal? midwest? genuinely can’t wait Trump win election shut libtards fuck too. I’m big guy recently (pre-Covid) got great gym routine, would wear every often. little self-conscious first, remembered putting work, fuck anybody wanted laugh. I'm ""just flu"" person lol. wear mask, stay home, wash hands, ect. believe science facts. one downplaying it. anything stated fact? Y'all doomers weird ones. encouraging people come elective surgeries, halting them. One major drivers home sales job market. places hiring, folks job going reluctant leave time soon.

The people neighborhood moving planned January, struggling sell house. sure. Biden often even know is, corrupt sleazy Trump, longtime Washington insider, history sexually assaulting women. May different kind damage trump done, underestimate it. Meaningless. occupancy 4 weeks stay open, many additional dead permanen9 damaged Texans mean? Sunday 0.

Wednesday’s backlog-check day.

The trend much downwards overall wondering state (Ohio) seen increase. many hot spot destinations like beaches Disney. think lot comes state planned. Ohio shut early helped initial spread. also concise openings structured. information gave consistent. US govt cluster fuck information changing it. Normal people idiots part forced already fits preconceived ideas. thought would voluntarily chosen treat 6 foot minimum would listen scientists politicians comes science stuff. right next ""wait two weeks"" ""its flu, bro."" Please stay safe. live NYC way come full circle like screenplay:

&amp;#x200B;

China starts locking people homes overnight. Eh.

Italy warns NYC cases first show here. Eh 


NYC warns whole country coming continue act irresponsibly. Eh.

NYC gets past worst it. Goes ""I told so"" rest US. Immediately acts virus defeated threatening progress. 


It's ride.  Fake News... like Covid-19!  Thanks! Thanks telling 5 years days predicted end date, spend constant prayer, predictions come pass, leaders plan always take credit saving world prayed hard devotion God changed mind ending world  Hi, I'm River Oaks Houston. thing happened me. rent increase.

Thank service 😎 Needed laugh thanks Elect retarded leaders, get retarded response. Especially federal level. lets real, bar going ""safe environment."" MAYBE restaurant, even go bathroom, walk people, enter exit 1 door others be. ""Leaves"" went former California governor ""will stay clear Gold's people start wearing masks floor — there's vaccine,"" TMZ said.

Dude canceling membership something. going while. Without understanding reasoning states well others can't really know sure come.

We could another peak soon July. Lots southern hemisphere countries picking now, follow similar seasonal pattern would imply increase November.

It's really quite fascinating trying understand spreading one area areas. Thank you.  far early tell. likely see spike week so. think he’s literally stupid big ego thinks he’s everything right. big fear giant man child acts he’s voted out, know he’s taking one gracefully silently sick competition Cali, TX, Florida. Like wildfire. I'm completely convinced. Bear here. I'm trying attack field, genuinely curious, course fulfilling duty scientist questioning anything seems off. also expect respond. know lot.

""economics, political science, anthropology, sociology...""

Curious though these, especially economics, notorious wildly wrong.

""Not orders magnitude - percentages best models falling 95% confidence interval models.""

Internal consistency imply accurate predictive value though. Past epidemics fallen widely outside many models, often due poor estimation variables like IFR, R0, etc... (swine flu instance, IFR dropped initial estimates 0.1-5% 0.02%).

""You need trial runs that's use models controls confounding factors plenty post estimation tests look things like endogeneity clues causal relationship wrong.""

I modeling cell consortia immune cells synthetic gene networks bacteria, vitro (or technically vivo bacteria, plate). Determining dynamics simple systems quite difficult variable, even run hundreds trials near identical conditions. similar things outset experiments, rarely better order magnitude without trials various conditions truly nail confounders contributing variables. me, beginning, felt models, especially human behavior, without benefit trials identical conditions best achieve order magnitude prediction, useful tools, lack rigor necessary confidence modelers state results instances. That's say, task much, much harder mine, state results confidence onset experiments.

Finally, I'll ask make predictions come true far, instance Sweden's ""natural experiment"". Swedes notoriously ignored study change gross overestimate deaths Sweden, Sweden controlling virus, change fact predictions order magnitude off. Perhaps models give self-isolation voluntary precautions enough credit? Perhaps nearly error models comes unpredictability human behaviors, enough throw order magnitude?

Not knock field except say extremely difficult job, thank work. question confidence predictions reported, quality work all. absolutely vital. Depends part AZ. store it’s maskless boomers hate fucking eyes I’m wearing one. better question one White House gotten Coronavirus despite wearing masks whole time..

Hmmmmmmmmmm.... health insurance though school, getting sick could quite expensive delay academic work. factor decision. worked AZ nursing home. called state surveyor report weren’t staff wear masks even though cms guidelines said should, basically told problem couldn’t anything straight told life worth paycheck.  Nah, 2020 dick. ended early would wait till Dec 30th really draw excitement.

The writers need time get murder hornets back mix. whole china/india North vs south Korea stuff play too. Thanks clarification reminder careful generalizations. I've met wonderful, intelligent people AL, frustrating see treated now. 

I think root still lies education system's shortcomings, highlighted large number people displaying unable think critically apply reason make decisions reflect reality, state's leadership showing. state fucked. Yeah figure increased exposure, maybe they’ll able collaborate amazing science tech firms. Smart rings new big thing. Also people dont realize get car accident family member heart attack hospital might ICU bed available chances recovery quickly surviving go down. big point pushed Governors states hit hardest months ago. rang? Perhaps missed hoard large, dense crowds standing shoulder shoulder shouting screaming expelling air deepest portions lungs. said protest was.more important virus ( cowards) piper come “this thing” mean hordes obnoxious obese idiotic countrymen coming country? Yeah, I’d want eliminate you, too. actually wouldn’t mind border enforcement around Pacific states right now, either. put cart horse, testing anti bodies testing virus community. Yup, mine increased $25/mo, still pet rent. I'll take it.  set Trump voter 2020 (before anyone hates much good option menu)

I wasn’t happy all, response pandemic lack leadership allowing matters public safety become political pushed back voting Democratic haven’t done since 2012. want remind everyone opening Texas nothing c-19 everything flushing people eligible unemployment rolls. Texas Governor: mess Texas!

COVID-19: Hold muh beer I'm sure people obtuse this. like refuse acknowledge well-established order things. states started upswing course deaths continue fall early states continue get better. westcoast. Sometimes go visit local parks stuff though, mostly stay city. seem trending well, however I'm seeing alot people ignoring basics. Even job people barely keep mask on, arm. make sure keep mind, minimum distance masks, going China right locking back down. best news virus seems weakening continues based things I've read, can't remember source, death toll lowering. However next 2 weeks huge wakening may like protests people becoming less interested following guidelines. Someone asked why/what type people dying go bar pandemic, answer.  Well, going back work office (although I've working whole time).
Not sure mean ""not helping insisting masks"". helping spread pandemic, hope. Hey dummeh go school? still around question sleep.

You've important voice last decades importance fitness. probably saved thousands lives inspiring people active.

Anyways, I've heard 6-hour day sleeper. Given there's school though says public sleep crisis people getting enough, thoughts importance sleep? white lady looked like hasnt stood eons riding mobility scooter give nasty look wearing mask. She, brother husband rest deliverance rejects family anything protect others themselves. state fucked rest America. Requiring wearing mask; requiring contact tracing. solution see. model South Korea. possible. want it. Worse, want live denial. don’t care know many people kids want summer activity get house. don’t blame wanting that. could argue whether opening pools terrible move not. assume though outdoor swimming pools much safer grocery stores continue shop at, especially restrictions measures taken reduce risk pools. least here, measures taken much stricter grocery stores it’s outdoors also helps choose forget happened fucking toilet paper this? imagine told everyone masks going scarce necessary. trouble frontline workers masks would nothing compared people hoarding day 1. I've many gyms man's photo wall. slap walk yours. Yeah think claims mainstream media covering anything pretty baseless.

If anything many headlines intentionally misleading. Often much even commenters call out. media pro-clicks pro-money. event pandemic, means pro-fear. Much like common sense advocating hydroxychloroquine month two ago. Common sense medicine done. 

Like said, clearly understand purpose masks. purpose reduce amount spread viral particles. reduces number people infected severity acquired disease. helps slow pandemic down. 

Their purpose never 100% block viral particle inhalation, subject review study provided. Nobody half brain thinks wearing cloth mask going stop breathing virus dentist sitting 12 inches away somebody's mouth. Vaccine? See like said stupid compare. understand unemployment benefits paid people work businesses employ others, right? That’s part thing mandated hire people work them.

How much money make year? privileged you? working home? state completely sticking head sand order appease superiors? ever position let go job fault unemployment assistance? family must provide for? old you? ever lost health insurance? ever position couldn’t afford purchase separate insurance that’s offered employer?

There many things purposely refusing even think way view others position even worse off. hey, White House sent email today saying “no second wave” it’s lie told media. Never thought I’d see level propaganda US. I've wanting go gym, require masks can't imagine cardio mask anyway. Honestly might one dumbest subs reddit. reaching r/hongkong levels ""passionate opinions subject know nothing about"" Trump nuke Agree. nuts. Well thanks information interesting. Sorry went thru :/ every unit owned someone like you, there’s ten owned hedge fund that’s sending renewal notices 10% increases know people afraid moving right now. Nah, deaths backlogged it'll take 2 weeks we'll know. Wednesdays always high reporting-wise, Monday/Tuesday low.


Confirmed cases increasing mostly due increased testing, good thing long deaths keep dropping can’t put genie back bottle google president Xi click news section see much he's flailing lol. need yell children. According article, rise opioid deaths began well pandemic stay home pandemic hit, state officials, medical experts drug recovery workers began notice increase overdoses. State officials said issued alert January warning public increase opioid-related overdoses.  sustained climb number opioid-related deaths previous year began November, according ProPublica Illinois analysis data Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office. stop allowing votes, would see votes Biden, Arizona native here. told dad thought AZ would fucked told stop obsessing crazy looked. can't find week total caseload doubled. It’s never gonna happen Enough drug holy shit probable funders West village students (their parents) could rich fucks corner country, world matter...

Manhattan *home* rich, (one the) *playgrounds* global rich. tax payer, u/kittykrunk essentially funded unemployment. liberal doomers, fair N95 seal proper around beard i'll die show world chin again. lawsuit criminal fraud charges? finally saw nose bikini wild Get Da Choppa! go look data see yourself. Explain it’s good thing lie public something supposed help pandemic? scarce...

ok and? tell us they’re short supply atm improvise scarf bandana like ppl whole reason

The reason would make sense lie us wearing masks ensure ppl get infected spread virus. Also ask this, lied us once, team likely lied us multiple times. lie credibility plummets.  Hindsight 2020
20202 crazy
Let’s get crazy
-prince lack actual leadership explains better. also don’t lock country seasonal flu. Imagine operating business usual one wearing masks staying home all. I’ve probably least 300 less encounters people community since covid started, I’m really seeing 8 people life past 3 months plus whatever brief protected interactions shopping. Comparing severity two completely asinine one isn’t like all. change title; it’s garbage.

Arnold juicing since thirteen he’s pretty much scientist. title implies disagreement mask policy. disrespectful Arnold supports masks.


People aren’t wearing masks Arnold left time being. Yeah similar, curve sometimes informative shows number cases. example go 1 case 4 that's R what, 3. still 4 cases, probably warrant full lockdown moment - rather isolate trace contacts etc. 50,000 cases R 3 pretty damn screwed. yeah, R number cases taken account, curve approximates time. Yeah, worry states too. said die permanent disability it.

The chances quite high. Repeatedly stating dishonest answer good look, suppose got defend Abbott.

Hospitalization rate 2-3 weeks set infections today.

Waiting hospitals close capacity guarantees go capacity. China's fault Amercans ridiculous babies can't sit still weeks. That's ticket. go India somewhere fast growth plateau phases. point? Yeah it’s like hit magic number 70% suddenly hit herd immunity. You’ll start notice slowing spread higher goes  Excellent, Smithers many states ignoring reality. 

States refusing face masks basic mitigation effort going get point hospitals run supplies, burnt traumatized work force, population can’t get care. 

They eventually close it’s going hurt kill far done right. US always dictatorship capital, comrade. read full text article seemed bit scant things DeSantis could shutting state down.

You know, like mandating face masks, actually enforcing social distancing, kind thing.

Maybe said bunch stuff presser somehow get mentioned. look tactics used horse-and-buggy lobby personal automobiles started become common. mother’s nursing prepped this. staff agreed stay inside home take turns shift. one out. residents owners, pretty sure weren’t getting paid anything extra. 

As nurse, I’d absolutely also. right, broad generalized statement need try use. Decades education funding dwindling away result. teachers buy school supplies classrooms yet police officers decked full military gear shows priorities lie Government funding. really truly mean disrespect, clarify 'primary motivations posting damn much topic try push Sweden towards strategy feature less death?' way worded sounds posting influence powers be, doubt meant. Cincinnati ftw interest fairness, posts made experts started telling us virus spread well outdoors. definitely concerned crowded beaches read Erin Bromage blog post. Comparing nyc florida dumb. Didn’t, actually. Bachelor’s degree. Nice try though. Sorry gone insane. literally said one parents die contract 🤣 Like know that?! need scapegoats, prisons fucking idiots crowding together screaming explain pretty well. many people bay area relay Bart get work. imagine many people willing anymore. US public lockdown. seeing public willing take another lockdown Use seven day rolling averages looking Sweden. Anything else going incorrect one way due report erratically.

[Current patients ICU appear still Confirmed cases utterly useless, especially looking Sweden since even increased testing cases missed. He's already came mocking others wearing masks. pretty clear thinks ""uncool"" manly. 

Also, others said, surprised he's getting plasma transfusions people antibodies already effectively immune well. claimed using drug, nearly much scaredy cat move vs getting intensive treatments. I'll tell man noticed hottest states ones biggest spikes? hot, people staying inside comfortable air conditioning. outside almost eliminates transmission found mom tested positive COVID 19. lives another state family members staying away weak eating drinking. travel state (which cases current state) visit her? feel totally helpless takes work. Tennessee numbers upward swing, actually hit highest overall one day hospitalization rate couple days ago, think governor completely given virus (not really interested first place- issued stay home order included six pages essential workers 1500 medical professionals begged to- lasted 3 weeks let expire). word since us slowing reopening. think stage 3 4 now, even sure anymore, word happen next. last covid updates back May, hasn’t addressed since. Davidson county (Nashville) run independent health department doesn’t follow governors plan chosen second time stay stage 2 getting bad. protests daily, even now, thousands showing wearing masks. we’ll see we’re weeks!  going shit show. Doesn’t seem like bad thing. said. Tenants would inconvenienced anything. “Homeless” hotel Airbnb days isn’t bad enough let landlord get you. least me. Depends person ay? article edited headline changed since posted it. See mod sticky.

This governor said though, need blame reddit hive mind fake news...

Blame lack statistics understanding governor. ...what one? Still little early tell. cases situation entire family would infected people would get sick. NYC mother children died, father fine. exposure, sick. Attempted goalpost shift, second attempt. Denied. 20 yard penalty, loss down. I'm curious know average lag positive test ICU admission? Given rest data tough math rough rate % cases ICU projection ICU admissions based case rate. I’ve always asked landlords put month month option price lease expires. oblige. assumed common practice everywhere perfectly safe virus go bars such. many delicious meatbags inhabit close quarters. Forced technology transfer economic dumping initiated US started all. cake eating situation, nursing homes exist people want family cared high cost, either dont want care home dont want pay (or cant)

And dont blame people choosing nursing homes. parents didnt spend middle 20 years life caring could put life hold spend money care. Fortunately many high enough functioning home care massive hurdle, lesson take care never able taken care better care yourself. Think beach houses... 

also covered federal flood insurance  Florida 21.5 million 
New York 19.5 million

Very similar numbers. New York 700-800 daily deaths peak. Florida would hit 2000 deaths equal like keep saying. expanded testing happening? According COVIDTracking huge increase testing. "" *undercutting Governor Ron DeSantis’s case recent increase cases part result elevated testing.* ""

Also remember reading Florida calculating Positivity rates (Total **People** Positive)/(Total **Tests** performed) rather (Total **People** Positive)/(Total **People** tested)

... even though often performing multiple tests per person. knew correct formula, lowered positivity rate threshold required reopening.

 *“We’re shutting down,” said. “We’re going go forward.”* great question, quick search says maybe bit influenza vaccine, enough doesn’t work, expressed differently. article read doesn’t indicate difference efficiency. disagree refusing participate COVID vaccine trials memories Tuskegee experiment understand rationale, majored history know memories traumatic events passed oral tradition.

Scientific racism (ie understanding natural selection works humans all) absolutely ubiquitous first half 20th century, although declining second half still made presence known occasionally (eg later stages Tuskegee experiment).

I don’t think people hesitant participate historical reasons think it’s anywhere near likely trails conducted bad faith would 80 years ago, hesitate based oral traditions community seems like non-zero probability scenario. Look cnbc trying optimistic, way going gonna see 200k end July. Hold up, rents dropping? 

*laughs california* Yeah imagine second time?! anti lockdowns really throw fit get it’s confusing things says appease voters. Saving life’s plenty action would taken. It’s always making voters happy. want open open it. Regardless right option going listen vocal part voter base people wanted everything open regardless led voter base doesn’t want blamed must young’s fault. Mexico Canada extended border closure another month (for now). eastern PA seen total 3 people stores without masks since April.

We really close NYC Jersey think scared us straight. Deaths quite literally one worst early indicators virus spreading impact happening. 

When ICUs running normal staffing/ patient levels deaths COVID place. 

Some come in, hit hard due prexisting, prognosis, patient wishes end care withdrawn die days. 

Some go full steam ahead, get treated week two get hit complication can't maintain thier oxygen die. 

Others hospital month longer sorts issues eventually care withdrawn finally succumb thier secondary problems virus. 

Deaths see today could people hospitalized couple days ago got admitted month ago. 

Now expect mortality/ deaths state go up, include COVID deaths hit operate surge capacity longer longer. without doubt lowering quality care means mistakes lack timely interventions means people die normally have. Australia getting hit sanctions China already.

Canada two citizens imprisoned (in harsh illegal conditions) retaliation lawful arrest Meng Wanzhou. 


I'd rethink want immigrate to. Yes. won’t know 2-3 weeks. thought sure early March. Crazy cough little amount blood, fevers, everything. Swabbed neg flu &amp; strep. Finally got antibody test big fat nope. changed behavior regardless results, would've nice clear.  plan leave California soon possible. I'm done school, I'm looking state programs next step. Rent, population, traffic, etc... gets old. weather sunsets nice traffic crowds get (or bunched exact place want go) wears thin. “rents dropping”, much mean it’s dropping? kind numbers expect? Lease ends months stay $30 less per month. 

I’m wondering market show price drop time move 100% problem America. Pure selfishness, thinking caring *only* giving shit actions directly put others danger. 

This isn’t solo, it’s collective society whole. self centered thinking Americans really exposed pandemic. Wearing mask much less protection people around you, although offers protection well. may give shit may fine catch it, person grocery store/bar/restaurant/whatever won’t fare well it? someone spread doesn’t health insurance needs hospitalized? 

It’s 100% selfish part, I’m honestly sure can’t see that. fucking understand people getting mad people wearing mask! really think half NBA move there, play month straight games, get infections?  Buy Disney Puts Covid-19, get rolled ambulance.

When sick thing, would debated getting bed house fire. Srsly. Surgeons nurses wear mask protection working out. always take mask breath without mask surgeries patients visits. Majority people breath improperly, n95 definitely somehow restrict breathing wear longer period time, blue mask cloth mask won’t protect mask. sweating, breathing fast, flow air decreases lung won’t take much oxygen in. Majority problems maybe experience fatigue, people obesity smoking history asthma would risk. people find problems accidentally heard ""prepare worst, hope best""?

That's different ""Assuring people worst scenario inevitable calling anyone disputes idiot"". wouldn’t count it. 

We ER nurse...yes, actual ER nurse refused wear mask wasn’t shift. Complained hated wearing 8 hours day wasn’t going wear one out, everyone else damned. 

Yup. Good times. wonder they're doing. told going Disney 2 weeks ago flew out. Guess must going Central Florida seems stupid Well I'm glad enforced work, hope effective.

The stuff standard talking points radio/fox news/OAN disinformation news etc Thank you! accurate information ive read while. states spikes ones didnt give shit first place. Texas, Alambama, type states. high intensity athletic training dabbled steady state cardio breathing snorkel. 

I hated it. Thinking terms hometown brought perspective people brought WW1. 234 town, gone. 2 college town. Should’ve asked decrease telling much Chinese Russians want re-elected. They'd throw huge party. I've spent fair amount time GA airports service executives last 2 weeks. 

AFAIK, airport staff give shit (no masks, social distancing, etc.). Maybe change executive airports. That's Colorado. wonder Florida like... wrong right. 


You right narrative Coronaviruses providing cross reactivity going give intrinsic herd immunity, wrong level Coronavirus cross reacticity directly related reproduction rate thus herd immunity levels. 


Essentially cross reactivity acts vaccine spread portion populace rest populace naiive. cross reactivity example 20% fully naiive (no coronaviruses ever) population may see herd immunity 80% infection (I math calculation likely off) . maybe new type virus, corona all. started market Beijing all... yes, cancel flights China. like that

Either taking seriously via information, youll take seriously via experience. hath chosen experience route. Wow, another sentence "".... herd immunity ..."", upgraded script? ;) Every time see headline projected deaths future always Rising. wish could take snapshot year see total devastation for. I'm doom-and-gloom guy, want shit way year ago, I'm pretty sure new normal going look nothing like year ago. here. Moving next week Nearly million deaths U.S. would mean 1 every 325 would die. That’s sad think about. protests bound Coronavirus spreading, least protest pictures shown, protestors wearing masks. Police people aren’t protesting aren’t. similar experience. couple years realtor come sure trashed place. washer &amp; dryer broke bought replacement deducted cost next month's rent. source instead bitter dismissive? Nobody thought protesting sanitary safe, thought necessary despite that. argument “you object unnecessary avoidable risks yet conspicuously silent completely different situation necessary risk therefore you’re hypocrite means lose reason” good argument. cat’s going back bag places lived raise monthly rate month month price 20% lease monthly price.

Are arguing important point. thought bathed blood Jesus? That's worrisome probably accurate way wording possible reality.  ever vaccine works significantly differently different races though? scientist working field n95s ventilators, wholeheartedly disagree you. I'm attributing position you. made sure quote quotation marks. 

I want try understand argument. feels like think general constitutional right ""freedom"", can't asked told new things. would either stay friends, get hotel 

Hey, qualifies ""homeless"" according official standards. maybe ""homeless"" *isnt* stretching it. may hurt it, people come contact could die. It’s common courtesy dude. yet shut whole world cater them... It’s tragic really. Also tragic don’t care. bit extreme.

I hope poor decisions serve examples shape future health policies.

Unfortunately answer isnt really helpful. curious liability waiver, relation American Workmans comp. I'm Chicago I'm seeing lot places market landlords intended rent month ago, seem like prices dropping much. I'm looking August 1st almost places market look at, confusing situation. LEGEND Groceries seem higher area (Central PA) though. least one year retail fast food. I’d say supply demand fallen rate, it’s still heavy sellers market now. Even ready buy I’d apprehensive know I’d paying premium. 

Once homeowners actually pay mortgages can’t we’ll see foreclosures prices fall. Fed trying hold long possible imagine next year we’ll start see true effects. That’s I’m hoping jump in. got tested bc brither exposed someone saw recently, worst enemies China Japan. Kim Dzong Un friendly soul president, also Trump-Putin affairs seems friendly.

So, looking outside, would guess country rather Eastasia war. way- say maybe way counties it- track trace contacts. two weeks uptick cases show June 3rd. We'll see look week.

remind week kinda weird rent increases faster new leases do. stay one place long start paying way people moved next door. would generally move road different apartments every years talk better deal. I’m calling 400,000 end year. can't read Hebrew. you? property taxes expenses double 400-600 world would something rent price? Crap bad. Der.... SIX WEEKS! Get life. big tech companies allowing WFH (Google, Facebook...)

Right, key word ""indefinite"" WFH. They're allowing duration pandemic, imagine want open offices back eventually. Canceling elective surgeries much make ICU beds available. scheduled surgeries result need ICU admission postoperatively (cardiac bypass, example). Elective surgeries cancelled middle peak order free resources - surgical masks, gowns protective equipment, nursing staff physicians extent, even possibly ventilators used - minimize unnecessary exposure patients hospital staff. also bad idea elective surgery patient may develop COVID trying recover surgery.
Of course small number patients undergo elective surgery end problems land ICU, much exception. mention Brazil article.

Are even aware zombie company epidemic PRC? curve flattened long ago. stopping exponential spread, stabilising number new infections day. 

Er no. Everybody thought peak April 29 830 cases June 10 1487 cases, 4 days 1000 cases since then.         
And no, extensions tests can't explanation. France increased testing even worst peak, due backlog, half real peak. weekly cases 10th were. Like countries. like 70-80% capacity times. fault for-profit system, hospital rooms literally treated like hotels designed used often not. saying do, hypothetically can.

This next year- shocked property taxes go over. lot municipal governments getting supported, there's much cut borrow...

I want landlord right WA State 99.94% people 60 survive Covid confirmed positive test. WA DOH

Solve traveling 125k miles survival rate get close number. Yet another reason trust government.

When disaster happens 100% own. sometimes government taking advantage YOU. cities tech workers make significant portion rentals. lot tech companies/tech departments moving permanent WFH. leases expire I'm expecting significant number move somewhere outrageously costed.

It's gonna crash market big cities drive prices smaller places. lol over-the-counter, no. meant Ivermectin pans out, relatively easy drug get prescription obtain pharmacy relative say, Remdesivir, given direct medical supervision hospital.  Upper Peninsula. ~8-10 years ago though. duplex math actually checks it, especially older landlords property paid off, suspect did. probably netting $450-500/mo it. pretty cheap though even area. 87 deaths reported Illinois today. Damn getting boated bottom lake exactly last night, 10 hours later story hit news. one Freedumb Party members wants talk it. Got renewal, raised rent dont flour. they're stupid. bad people counting plasma then. thinking exhaustive work blood center use plasma therapy. depends city building. live building made 1930 “rent protected” city, meaning cannot increase rent 3% year. Buildings made 1970 different set rules. moved 10 years ago gone $1100 month $1500, whereas salary gone $40k $90k time span. 

However, tried move apartment now, would start $2000-2200. 😐 fucking real. Thought shit going months ago idiots don’t know we’re halfway June highest cases Florida, going supermarket, barely masks. wears masks? Younger people around age, old fucks making mad Never let good crisis go waste... likely donated plasma, likely people received unhelpful plasma. Probably tested using two different antibody tests, expensive time, hard come by. house prices? roof I’m mask doesnt even prevent much. no, working food business impossible keep distance. Maybe stop dehumanizing people referring herds? Like one saying automatically walking virus can't protest. They're saying susceptible getting it/spreading protesting. seems referring anti-lockdown protests, different. Anti-lockdown protests center around idea freely choose spread virus many ways propagate idea virus real/serious actively flaunt use ppe. 

You're also grossly misquoting intent letter 1300 experts signed. give license go ""spread coronavirus"", acknowledged right protest reasons protesting ways trumps virus. letter way stating protests could done safely offered guidelines so. None negates licenses spread COVID 19.

There's never vaccine deployed Coronavirus, basically hoping scientists world find one quick. Politicians seem taken liking saying “we enough ventilators.” 

As guarantee everything going fine. COVID patients put ventilators survive. I'm aware call facts, i'm sure Alex Jones love patronage. body bags start piling people start dying hallways hospitals, would beg it. sad part is, way society take seriously, occurs.  landlords eviction-happy going accept tenants evicted anyway, less rent before, top costs readying property carrying vacancy months. Wait knew ivermectin tested idea tested counter drug purpose? Surely much talked about? Gavin Newsom needs make masks required he's completely totally afraid to. live Bay Area California used live SC. go here, 80-90% people wear masks. see pics friends family (out restaurants, beach, etc) one is. may see one mask crowd. It’s absurd. one gives shit there. deserve walled world. It’s like one simple thing reduce spread. Fuck selfish assholes. Depends need go name brand. Plenty benches Amazon less than$200  course. Sweden stands own. pretty much countries. None two factors across board. yourenot wrong people like took one look Swedish ""strategy"" said months ago ""it work"". know, that's certainly early say. right know that's way looks. saying like reason Swedish government said focusing energy protecting risk. Guess what? failed. admit know. conclude something known long rest Swedish government predicted herd immunity Stockholm May. wrong. admit Swedish government said goal ""flatten curve"". latest figures prove failed no, that's false. curve flattened months ago, indications dropping downwards moment. quite misinformed there. worry, Swedish government's ""strategy"" failed every way based said would happen, versus actually really. number one goal overload hospital system, overloaded. even built extra temporary one hundreds beds, never suppose going say Sweden can't even compared predictions/goals, course can. compare pretty much anyone's predictions, they're dealing factors (unlike different countries).


Look, clearly capable correctly interpreting anything I'm saying. Pretty much every sentence I'm writing correcting things putting mouth. let's leave got stupid. 

Don’t feel bad. amount stupid people comes covid California probably equal. 

We love say, oh we’re liberal, know better, like rednecks. think Covid shown we’re arrogant. 

During lock everyone good. soon started reopening everyone acted like over. positive thing lockdown month finally debt free (not really reach, still) every city expensive. Midwestern cities offer lots amenities rents often marginally higher suburbs. Though outside Chicago car tends remain necessity, drives short. extra bonus COVID world, live less 15 minute drive 2 major hospital systems world class ICUs. get seriously sick, least that. opposed rural area might 30 minute drive hospital stabilize ambulance helicopter gets take good hospital. renewed lease January. increased. Wish able wait. Yes. False positive antibody test. They're right. don't. read McKee first tested positive potentially deadly virus February, diagnosed feeling ""clear obvious"" symptoms, told NBC 5. Coronavirus: “Can’t wait...” Tell landlord... fucker jacked rent 200 dollars. piece shit fix anything. debt themselves, richest goes buddies top 0.01% people defend since...well they'll billionaires day! lol no. many idiots there. Positive rate good metric, misleading too. Here's example:

* Week 1: State runs 10,000 tests, finds 1,000 positive, 10% positive rate
* Week 2: State runs 20,000 tests, finds 2,000 positive, 10% positive rate

Just looking positive rate, may think 'hey, still 10%, situation getting worse', I'd argue situation getting worse. Why? doubled number tests STILL got positive rate. state run 20,000 tests first week, unlikely would maintained 10% positive rate, would probably lower. Every incremental test run, less likely find positive case people likely positive probably ones likely tested first; run 20,000 tests first week, know first 10,000 came back 1,000 positive results 10% rate, next 10,000 would probably come back less 1,000 positive, let's use 800 example. overall positive rate would 9% case. Then, comparing 2nd week, see positive rate increased 9% 10% number tests.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's see it. 9 possible combinations tests up/flat/down cases up/flat/down:

* Tests &amp; cases (positive rate could down) clear
* Tests &amp; cases flat (positive rate down) situation getting better
* Tests &amp; cases (positive rate down) situation getting better

&amp;nbsp;

* Tests flat &amp; cases (positive rate up) situation getting worse
* Tests flat &amp; cases flat (positive rate flat) situation same
* Tests flat &amp; cases (positive rate down) situation getting better

&amp;nbsp;

* Tests &amp; cases (positive rate up) situation getting worse
* Tests &amp; cases flat (positive rate up) situation getting worse
* Tests &amp; cases (positive rate could down) clear

&amp;nbsp;

Hospitalizations much better metric though tests/cases/positive rate, leading indicators eventual hospitalizations eventually deaths. 60 grand.. tax money... «Socialising, looking good, experiencing new things»
You socialise online, doesnt restrict you. dont rly get u mean «looking good», third one thing really think thats good point. even then, lot people go work, go home, sleep everything again. also things inside, we’re staring walls 24/7 here.

15 million COPD US even people get straight get unlucky die even without pre-existing conditions.

119K dead something scoff here, thats SERIOUS shit, even ""just old people"". 

I respect opinion, understand you’re coming here, hope realise we’re whole quarantine thing. lease running up. Told landlord I'd stay knocked rent $100.

Everyone try negotiating rent lease coming end. worst happen say back before. Leasing empty units major pain landlords right now.  😂 He's 72 sounds like quick maffs fell short, per capita got far more, even gotten more, considering 30 million Americans work thus LOST EMPLOYER TIED HEALTHCARE PANDEMIC, impossible stipulations receive benefits USA, moreover many still yet receive dime ""your"" country give fuck you, yet still white knight corrupt officials, i'm happy government either, lie make look better, i'm partisan hack Yep. grocery shopping every two weeks, get store opens, it’s always Boomers aren’t wearing masks proceed try cut front Millennials Gen Xers masks waiting line store open. act like there’s pandemic people existence. said don’t understand people would want eat restaurant. Maybe don’t want to. Maybe people do. 

What people allowed different understanding people may strong desires shouldn’t hard Good know. come death rate Ohio relatively high? Nursing homes? half people Reddit reasonable are. replies I've come across hit doublethink hard get whiplash. Tantamount basically saying ""the virus avoids liberals"" ... donated plasma. think test wrong? people learned wash hands taking piss, others learned piss hands. Yeah second wave Spanish Flu 1918 killed millions. first wave nothing compared came after.  UBI single issue, literally value stay home care givers, allows people better access food healthcare, people don’t worry food housing, levels playing field don’t agree «making sure hospitals overwhelmed» strategy though. strategy answer question: «How virus stop threat?» answer either waiting vaccine, herd immunity, drastically improved treatments. Making sure hospitals overwhelmed answer question. means end, end?

I followed everything Sweden closely, feel mostly rethorics point. herd immunity werent strategy, always planned waiting vaccine treatment, try stop virus safeguard citizens better, stead letting virus run course? herd immunity werent table, let possible get virus wait? quite thorough analysis comparison Swedish response compared neighbours explanation new questions path taken. Exactly, rest assured take path. gone way market YET mean follow trajectory. input lag, there's nothing anyone right stop decline prices uptick supply. Trump. take words explain it. churros awesome that’s due testing! Oh wait... antibody tests often used wildly inaccurate may report positive antibodies created response viral stimuli.

From conclusion [SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence neutralizing activity donor patient blood San Francisco Bay results also show seroprevalence IgG antibodies SARS-CoV-2 blood donors non-COVID-19 patients seen tertiary care hospital San Francisco Bay Area March April 2020 low **0.10% (95% CI: 0.00% - 0.56%) 0.26% (0.00% - 0.76%)**, respectively. seroprevalence rates two distinct populations San Francisco Bay Area near specificity limit Architect assay, far lower specificity limits many lateral flow immunoassays. findings contrast community-based studies reported higher rates seropositivity in

Agree. hard prevented making living avoid relatively small risk entity supposed make possible without becoming destitute can’t relied on. Yea! you’re wearing mask yourself, seem love get close possible, you’re clearly trying avoid old mouth-breathin ass. glorious! Knight player btw. Yeah. still got fall winter season make even worse interactibility flu added in. 2nd wave hits oooh boy going get rough. quantifiable - much depends treatment effective terms COVID onset severity. also depends readily available easy produce treatment is, plus administered. 

We could discover 10 treatments, they're relatively expensive given via IV medical supervision, end pandemic. Likewise, find one treatment taken orally home first sign symptoms plentiful plus cheap produce (fingers crossed, Ivermectin), would enough get us minus vaccine. Remember Sweden supposed 40.000 dead early may didnt lock down? Another well-funded model vastly different outcome appear 3,2,1... Suburbs rural areas available land build supply general. They’ll probably go up, won’t quite skyrocket. Fair point deep dish. I’m New York. Granted it’s middle state, pizzerias started relocated city people. It’s thing Papa Johns Nashville garlic butter. know. 

You don’t know. 

covid-19 symptomology 14-day expiration date. presumption flies face medical scientific data. 

The average 2 weeks mild infection (meaning half take longer; half don’t); three six weeks moderate infection. 

The available news reports confirm none *seriously ill.* None hospitalized. Well... like rich spend much higher % income ""wants"" rather ""needs"". making $30K year, spend much higher percentage income rent, utilities, food, essentials. much difficult cut back crisis vacations, fashion, concerts, nice restaurants.

The poor tend spend money spend survive, even pandemic. could done after911. Go patriotic route slogans like United Stand, support front line health workers, organize mask making PPE donation drives, discourage people hoarding, appeal people’s good nature. *until people see hospitals full denying care*

This even happen NYC. would happen anywhere else US? wide community spread country late February. one reinfected there's possible answer question. Mid 2021 can’t come soon enough 30k taxes? I’m really surprised number think Texas usually fairly high teacher pay compared nearby states average 55k starting salaries 45-50k. guess probably depends lot district though. Mostly we've learned. march hydroxychloroquine pushed hard, know strong evidence effective people hoped caused severe side effects, given doctors looking those. NY 88% people put ventilators died, we're seeing doctors taking care put trying people put ventilators likely survive not. also evidence something simple decreasing amount people [vitamin could help reduce spread severity cases. knows many lives information alone could saved we'd known march. insane much still learn virus spreads body. infections deaths must grossly underestimated.

Do reverse calculation via mortality. around million must overwhelmed.

I think re-urbanization trend spearheaded Millenials 15 yrs ago reversing. definitely push towards single family homes past 5 yrs &amp; generation starting families, pandemic &amp; density playing huge role infection rates, there's rush towards exit. mean, half south america infected.

I see ""Summer Heat"" really anything combat apart maybe long would live surface. (I'm scientist, pretend one online). Thank right side many issues. plenty examples people testing positively many months. suggest otherwise dishonest, many posts. I'm sure here, suspect agenda. radar long time. came across staged...and funny rents frozen year year multi year leases? Oh stfu already... dont die herd immunity hill... keep typing much feel bad family... o.O yes correct reference numbers, Spanish flu killed ~ 6,700 per 1 million Americans.

covid current sits 350 per million, 5%

it important note first wave Spanish flu tiny, second wave dwarfed several fold numbers lining way makes Spanish flu-like deaths tolls possible precautions taken. unlikely aggressive mutation like Spanish flu, Covid appears contagious. could kill fraction rate Spanish flu did, still potentially match exceed number sheer volume infections, hospital overload. Many die Covid19, without ever tested, leave alone treated, Covid19. even make statistic death Covid19.

Time Welcome San Francisco. That's silly. Get bubble, people fucking dying. Last time chicago saw homeless man walk around dick out. False, actually 17.4% yiu wear mask per CNN'S doctor. Whether trust opinion you. Additionally, wearing mask lower chances 3%. funniest thing I've read day. Funny cause true! agree 100%. We've lived long America without worry disease (even SARS/etc. make huge impact here) we've forgotten terrifying be. hope learn necessary lessons without doubling tripling current death count. better explanation:

""When percent positive high, may indicate enough testing performed capture much disease community testing may focused people severely ill.

When percent positive low, may indicate widespread testing performed percent positive may accurately reflect much disease present community."" 35 percent infected don’t even symptoms. Survival rate 99.74 percent overall. Survival rate even higher 50. shit people done.  Actually, afraid passing high-risk people. Yeah house walk every day market ~2 years price 1.15 million. house next sold 950k week market. probably going really makes million barrier look big. actually racism. doctors said 90% patients black. black council members voted favor masks, whites against. prices arent moving Irvine, CA. Still expensive AF Oh yes, absolutely. look home town next cases weeks, pandemic over. Oh, referring adjustable dumbbells. look pricey hell, regardless.

For bench, splurged mine dropped like $250. That’s good. area people good masks even it’s required. Hopefully places ignoring masks seeing huge spikes get program. think that’s housing prices metro Atlanta suburb going up. lot people moving since work remote schools better here. tell everyone bumfucking awesome. Actually know Zillow rentals too. sending messages already.

Thank you. old people starting realize rich young people could afford $2-$3 million dollar house. bought 90s 2000s $2 $3 million realizing sell $1ish million. 

Not chance. essentially saying upper end market catastrophically collapsed. numbers gave would represent 50-67% drop (and really, far time factor decade two appreciation saying bought). That's even close true. long fear opening controlled.

Literally accountability. follow ensure proper steps taken.

People wearing masks, contact tracing still enough testing.

To make worse morons like Joe Rogan Trump made wearing mask political issue mouth breathers stopped.

So work reopen done correctly, consequences.

Lying required work mean work got done.

Further fall feeling still wave reopening. Protests factor next week.

But also continued reopen making issue much worse.

So yeah can't fix stupid. First, false positive % reflect false cases random population. 

False positives count towards counts used generate headlines like ""Florida's Daily Coronavirus Cases Triple""

It's also we're flat count cases nationwide. large number false positives able go 1% prevalence since mathematically 2700 cases, meaning 2100 real cases

These case counts include antibody tests now. active cases rising. foreigner get new visa 3/28 enter. visa mostly preserved essentials business travelers, need urgent visit immediate families, etc. ""If test, cases.""

In sentence, ""you"" mean whichever audience wants mean. mean, U.S. mean alleged countries. both. deliberately vague, accurate reading part anyone's nothing saying underlying notion could stop testing, anything affirms opposite that

Except he's bragging testing administration neglected deferred states. words, Trump administration's actions undermine words. know... first sentence direct response post, second expanding thought. comment wasn’t especially useful though, since me, you, everyone else sub overtly biased. somebody middle protests, nobody forgetting pandemic. Tons people urging people wear masks. Hand sanitizer gloves handed tons tons tons volunteers. 

The media may mentioned it. majority protesters pro mask sanitation. article Virginia.  VA means Veterans Administration. case. don't. always grave China finally admitting it. daughter right, idiots. nothing protest, distance masks. understand call everyone criticises behavior Nazi shit. even help government get rid spreading virus communities. No, idiots, there's doubt that. Great detective work there, friend. type shit really leads stop wonder world living in. shedding enough virus test positive, stands reason may well contagious. find single doctor saying person definitely contagious. mean, said months ago giving something like $500 million (or more?) credits. I've seen anything yet.  Cocaine rape! hope sigh...stay safe Trump going realize late actually worn mask consistently, probably would November not? Healthcare workers ignore safety guidelines common sense time. Go healthcare-adjacent smoking area, they’re full nurses. Doctors failing/refusing wash hands job perennial problem. still voice reason!? anything permanently change structure run old folks' homes. linking studies backup argument asshole move. im forced google **your argument** order either

1) learn it
2) refute it.

either way dick move. add that, *Arnold’s gym,* everyone bodybuilding Arnold knows Gold’s. isn’t it’s membership thing, saying “Arnold leaves legendary [Gold’s] gym” implies he’s publicly distancing them, really isn’t comfortable mask policy go back it’s changed there’s vaccine According article able travel there. big city either, near one really.

I’d say maybe 2% wearing masks.

We’re going much - I’d estimate that, around 60% know 2m is.  Optics! Yeah don’t know. Australia wouldn’t let anyone without mandatory quarantine shelters. doubt guy responded find reputable sources...

 are, desk three-sided cubicle it’s main corridor office. everyone that’s walks area. Plus, none workers understand personal boundaries. Thanks response! So? fact remains explosion corona going right warm hot states. I’m interested learn useful antibodies would accepted India. slow sad decline seems expontional downward tregectory. someone brought US TV, movies, music, extention that, culture, trends lifestyle, I've always looked mighty, cool, powerfull, safe, amazing, America.
But grew saw world little closer detail. America land free (LA Race Riots) home brave, (School Shootings), give us poor, (9/11) needy (Trump) ... that's left nation intentionally torn peices thoes supposed keep together. everyone fighting piss shit tiny morsels fall gaping maws obease juggernaughts looming masses downtroded, mentally segregated workers. Distracted fabricated conflicts continous 24 news glamorising murderers, rapists vile despicable humans. Everyone happy hating anyone reasons even understand themselves. happened man, America used cool. give fuck low chance killing me, people around life I'm worried about. parents high risk become sick even die virus are. Everyone team annoyed either pissed they're making us return work. coworker tell able see mom anymore mom lung cancer survivor, forced office. company risking lives make workers sit cubicles, following strict guidelines office, benefit received. fucking retarded. food buckets OK tho- right?

Because basement’s full 0,6% IFR account excess deaths either, (which mention) Stockholm quite high rate excess deaths (more deaths normal + Covid deaths) april guess IFR closer 1%. 

If I'm right - correct wrong - 0.6% refers Case Fatality Rate Infection Fatality Rate. **The Public Health Authority published study showing 0.6 percent infected people Stockholm died,** 

This would mean IFR lower 0.6%

In addition this, would question use excess mortality rates estimate IFR. 

Taking UK point example - significant number excess deaths since March attributed C-19. reason many deaths - National Health Service effectively shut - people critically ill unable unwilling acess medical services. pretty much non-Covid related procedures cancelled, deaths attributed people unable access treatments vital services like cancer diabetes. 

Have look charts \- show amount people UK died home since lockdown unable access vital medical services stopped due C-19. 

There additional [10,000 dementia April alone England Wales, caused lockdowns - figures include rest UK (Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland). 

Already, people died UK knock-on effects lockdown measures actually died C-19. ya think? OOOPS Every time public wearing mask, help normalize mask wearing. every time public without one, normalize wearing mask.

This public health crises requires mass coordinated action. we've left task little effective leadership national scale US. we're burdened dual responsibility: taking action limit direct spread virus, taking action encourage others limit direct spread virus.

You wear mask, even public. although shaming may annoying, actually significant public service. Normalizing mask wearing save lives. one live Florida wears mask besides workers. old people coming back masses everything open. It’s horrible. even remotely close 1%. principal issue reporting whole thing - order give unbiased reporting, media outlets better job general education risk lies. Instead 'ANOTHER DAILY HIGH CASES' xyz city. means jackshit given greater overall testing.

The OVERALL infection fatality rate is, CDC thinks, somewhere region 0.3% (possibly even lower). age-stratified. factor age in, rates ridiculously low far less day-to-day routine activities people undertake - looking somewhere 1 3000 - 1 5000 someone 50 dying COVID. Yes course outlying cases, vast majority underlying major comorbidity (diabetes heart disease particularly problematic appears). worse flu, sure, much worse nuke global economy? second third order effects whole thing probably, view, going kill far people COVID gets.

And school aged kid? Well better chance struck lightning according Cambridge University research analysed UK ONS stats. But, sadly, get reported appropriately UK, instead inane discussion whether get kids back school. 

We ABSOLUTELY shield vulnerable, support risk (particularly aged). targetted appropriately, instead currently doing. Darwin awards still ""given"" people take gene pool acting stupidly. apply vast majority Covid deaths. Yeah, fuck Townhall, though. hope right. know handling opening-up part well - masks required, even close enforced. many packed bars without masks. 

We may rise exponentially before, going good. Umm Arizona (my state) #1! It’s frightening Civil War par US total 1918 flu assuming count sides. seventh day advantist founded person thought world going end multiple times. Im suppose start course october 2020.in perth..not sure situation then...frm malaysia bdw country from? believe socialized healthcare, minimum wage? explains anti-Trump narrative. countries like US pulls bogus climate-accords want renegotiate trade deals make fair. like use website COVID checks state level. right, minimal hospitalization change +2% % positive relative testing also trending slightly lower. know know. personal theory it. one apparently cares people much. comes making decisions Coronavirus, you’re weighing formula: (Chance get coronavirus die*how much care myself)+(Chance actions cause others get coronavirus die*how much care others) VS. (How much don’t like Coronavirus restrictions). think high chance would die virus high self interest, you’d want stay inside, logically speaking, vast majority people get coronavirus fine. think there’s high chance actions could cause others die coronavirus high empathy, you’d also stay inside, there’s crux. hard evidence point following guidelines kill people, without commensurate empathy, that’s weighted low equation.

TL;DR: (High self interest*low chance personally dying=low concern) 
(High chance killing others*low empathy=low concern)
(Mildly onerous restraints=more two compounding low concern situations) “There rising coronavirus cases states. states hot. Thus hot temperatures effect coronavirus”

This you’re saying. aren’t taking consideration variables states open, frequent travel them, lack policies actually slow spread..  one already, drop $5k basic home gym. Yeah, people sub screamed months China isn’t trusted taking 31 cases face value. I'm talking journalist, seems reported factual information. Okay. think trying make point, ""flu vs covid"" comments idiotic.

I quoted number far. Let's argue people agree you, know numbers nobody yet knows. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott blames young people spread coronavirus instead fact opened state May.

FUCK. Ah yes, young people huge student loans ""asked"" work keep meger health benefits pandemic. Yes ones bosses saying wearing mask ""scare customers"" 

Yep I'm sure trying get infected. /s We’ll second wave visitors Texas, Alabama, Florida 3/4 major growth states nation currently do! One co-worker came said I’m going cough prove it’s over. didn’t appreciate swift kick nuts I’m taking shit serious. Virus doesn’t care someone international student either they’re still allowed in. aren’t long term partners? “New York isn’t never Italy!” Jim Bakker still business? world full evil... Yep, instead losers “heroes” sitting asses contributing nothing society. That’s still bad news. New cases doubling means rate transmission increasing. need know severity issue. wife probably remain hermits next 6-12 months Yeah I’m asshole telling people shouldn’t risk lives pointless things. rationale schools open unless going mandate masks social distancing. district work seem time anything business usual. Yep... are.... 


Now what??? course feasible, would prisoner less one organ live? would 'evil CCP' dispose remains him? feasible.
The 'news' reliable source. originally made tabloid Epoch Times, fabricates kinds accusations zero evidence. remember one saying Jiang Zemin former President reincarnation frog, give idea ridiculous gets. Well fly UK, probably got magic petrol Dominic Cummings. Lift want come. caught early hospital treated s.o. wear ppe!

We warned coming in, warned every single person came contact him.

You could hear wheezing 2 foot away!
They wanted test meet early requirements.

The weekend official case came in. first death.

It us, thru area.

We believe Typhoid Mary (teen daughter) brought home.

Week (end February) complaining taste smell appetite problems 16.

Then like dominoes dropped 7 days last. everything could; saw doctors warned going saw primary curbside.

By March 30th house 14 days clear.

Would like get antibodies testing. idiot Doctor Miami couple years ago got cancelled meltdown Uber went viral. got degree Cuba working U.S. hospital. would get checked out. Wholeness. think enough information call Swedish model failure. 

Also, US ""model"" - called that. Oh sure, war literally every casualty one countrymen, it’ll always remain top.

The American civil war absolutely fascinating, thinking yesterday wild grandmother born 1930, war wasn’t even 70 years old! hot Florida, Arizona Texas right now?

[Arizona, Florida Texas See Highest Number New Coronavirus Cases Last  offense parents screws loose government lies paid corporations.   Orange County literally bullied public health director quitting made masks mandatory. people don’t want wear masks. idiots like Joe Rogan idiots listen reason take advice, furthering idea masks useless. said much yet said nothing many think avoid treatment? maybe 7-10 percent. guess, failed people pneumonia die alone homes bodies found, often within weeks likelihood tested corona virus.

only two states offering probable death numbers. New York 15 percent total; Maryland 2 percent.

I know finding bodies Bergamo....i doubt testing them. 

if mega outbreak would expect number die home (how much hospital bills?) go up.  Walmart, GNC, CVS, Amazon claiming cures COVID19 selling it?

He guest show literally said works older coronavirus strains promoting it. 

 plan lockdown. buying time (I live AZ) massive outbreak. time squandered, caused much tension among residents it’s really starting, people can’t collectively work together fight common enemy. Echoing people said 6'8"" spiky bits umbrella held eye level. terrifying. Didn’t expect laugh comments post. Thanks laugh! Way early found spinal fluid, would outside immune system, similar herpes works completely get attacked re-activate. may small unlucky that's works knows end day know infectious unless studyin. noticed that. 
  
  
 60% Covid deaths? Canada 80+%, national disgrace. Lung scarring renal failure
 one knows why. Florida open up. month ago. barely shutting down. we’re back exponential growth. 

What fucking want? casket parade 4th July? Man, sound like complete asshole. would anyone listen opposed relevant information available? tell stop dying libs, would work? NYC became hotspot travel mecca, hundreds thousands tourists world going there, know else goes NYC tourist hundreds thousands? Americans. Also, March late - spreading people going coming NYC US going February. 

Your asinine claim residents NYC blame deeply objectionable. Think happens every developed country rid virus returns work America still lock down. also tend ones around patients given time. Also, saying ""just support staff"" kind shitty. We're support staff, one way another. 

At dad's funeral, woman asked now. said surgical technologist, proud one. said, ""Oh, well, need too."" 

But agree, woman dumb shit. Well luckily states death counts. Almost testing leads positive test results. trying get political battle, politicians hands dirty. Presidential salaries heck even Congress/Senator salaries make multi-millionaires. Nancy, Joe, Bush’s, Obama, Gingricht, Clinton’s, many politicians sides become political careers. “speeches” “TV deals”. 

Getting another point... However vote, country continue successful it’s built. Italy outbreak seeded outdoor soccer game. Crowds, yelling, sound familiar?  know developed neutralizing antibodies exactly? already know people do. think happens enter literally country earth without visa? Except for, say, **one hundred eighty-four** countries don’t require one. think beat shit something? Except statement needs context well. It’s even clear it’s talking Covid specific hospitalizations. Leaves could also read leaves membership, etc.  come I’m hearing anything news? terrifying. live Iowa, things seem progressively getting better. worries me. Although friends going out, acting like nothings wrong, I’m staying hell home struggle too. It’s lot extra work, it’s sort air whether it’s even necessary.

What I’ve started quarantining groceries 3 days, disinfecting things need 3 days up. I’ve got big plastic bin dry goods, separate mini fridge using cold storage quarantine.

Not everyone option, made grocery shopping little less process. first trip things got crazy March took almost 4 hours shopping disinfecting, used lot Lysol process (I family, lots items). wasn’t sustainable.  25 yr old Austin, TX resident here. Gov indeed garbage alluding spread fault younger folks every place go town older folks completely negligent social distancing masks. political/financial motivation US reporting COVID-19 death. part CARES Act, Medicare pays 20% reported COVID-19 cases.  leave open possibility over-reporting certainly possible scenarios (see nursing homes). nefarious plot? Doubtful, environment medical facilities shedding staff fewer elective procedures; nursing homes warned taking elderly patients stimulus checks, think rule degree mis-reporting. CDC?

Because think find lots fine print methodology ""weighting"" ""setting negative values zero"" ""Farrington algorithms"".

If numbers CDC (which people seem getting them) concrete people assume. Windsor. saw car Pennsylvania plates obviously owned guy living town too. know they're driving USA tagged cars, they're definitely making road trips across country rent car drive back. even mandatory, people wear think argument indoor vs outdoor. sure data shows, intuitively make sense would spread indoors. 

That said, shoulder shoulder protests/rallies stupid. Leigh dundas piece shit even went confirmed numbers 1.06 well beyond CDC estimate something going here.

but seems odd count probable deaths, bake factor 10 ""or maybe more"" baseline estimate. sounds like cherry even New York many infections less 0.002% people 40 New York died past 3 months.

that relevant conversation. median age US 38 years old. stealing... 7 blocks Seattle? Lol Also live NOVA towards Arlington DC, seeing same. EVERYONE going bars stuff without masks. However, think ""VA"" referring Veterans Affairs, places reopened NOVA seem getting worse information virus serious.

Which governments, officials doctors across world ignoring regulations implemented Yes! Birding fun. Merlin Bird ID app? It’s amazing. running list bird visitors past 6-7 years it’s always fun add new one. indigo bunting first time ever year! someone please explain me? outside outside cheek-to-jowel thousands people thing. Either near proximity matters - four walls hundreds feet apart changing much point people scenarios wearing masks. 

I care political angle either side, get it. see spike protests damn sure logical say 'outside'. Old touch people always blame youth fucking everything. I'm already 48 hope never turn grumpy old jackass blames everyone else problems Low IQ

Afraid looking weak

Thinking untouchable Although bad, hell think worse New York? ""Leaves"" implies leaving something forever. slight cold at-risk people elderly people many people lung conditions, diabetes, etc., 

Literally respiratory infection dangerous groups people. wearing masks even gave shit prior March 15th? deaths low scary part. First, gives people false sense security. It’s big talking point people want live denial. 

Second, next couple weeks going look like? didn’t get gradual climb. lot AZ deaths localized certain vulnerable populations, it’s coming masses came people let guard down. 

The lockdown backfired hard. gave us time congregate beach could ready tsunami hit. course young healthy. everyone world 20 wouldn’t care covid. question spread happened that’s important Haven’t figured out? *are* living disaster movie. films art imitating life. It’s unclear ending we’re though: virus kills huge chunk humanity left scavenge earth virus won’t kill large part us, looting rioting could get worse sparking small civil wars firing nukes we’d die. 

This conjecture though. Damn. [8th 2019 terms percent total population, still there. total population, looks fifth know, actually read Bible understand don’t temple pray. title little misleading. read thinking ""Arnold walked wear mask?"" I'm glad case.

I think misleading. provide enough details. filled gaps incorrectly someone could easily made different assumption based limited information title.

This people read articles titles.

Sincerely,     
Richard Nixon Probably kinds people would hang bar row pandemic kind people would wear masks first place. XD know compares, Spain's autonomous regions too.any language, run education, health services etc. state alarm activated, believe devolves power back central government degree. right - original comment historical issues different user, replied disagreement IFRs. 

I stand statement IFR estimates COVID19 Spanish Flu overlap though - current estimate COVID globally range 0.7-3.4%, Spanish Flu 2.5%. Current estimates may end wrong, may vary greatly country, skewed whether countries carrying seroprevalence not, present. experience. part social life take seriously (even mumble hi people every day). said eye candy good heart too. Makes sense, steroids help stop overwhelming immune response happening patients ventilators. great discovery. terms US-China rivalry, China supports Trump's re-election

Take NBA example, competing team, want team selfish core player knows improve data care team?

&amp;#x200B;

As Chinese, reason personally want Trump re-elected man committing crimes humanity face coronavirus nailed pillar shame history eternity. dump tests Lysol? California bad Weird, considering stupid thing CAME CHINA. reasons, NZ never happen here. large part, fewer people entire country living New York City alone lol.

And country’s strength never obedience plan sitting inside restaurant bar vaccine pretty much. can't wear masks eating/drinking, inside area lot people? Thats main source spread. PR/Gaslighting father wife decided take trip Florida New Hampshire hit beaches last week. work father Massachusettes, staying home since mid march shop stayed open order protect town Vermont virus virtually non-existent comparatively rest U.S.

Even new orders, facemasks worn work place, informed continue work home masks worn, said may need replace soon growing business show up. (After telling would come call proper authorities enforce safety codes, decided continue work smile face)

This morning, father mocking physical workplace. cares company pride sons health. 

What essential business stopped operating 65 employees physical workplace, ask? produce turbines refining crude oil, 80% shipped Saudi Arabia. *If* infectious dose matters - Coronaviruses far I've read - cloth mask still help protect lowering that. get viruses unless wear respirator tight-sealing gas mask filters, get *less*, might make difference whether immune system cope. would explanation CFR apparently higher among health workers general population: infectious load comparatively huge, there's repeated ""infection events"". Japan living in? walked bar restaurant street tonight. mask seen indoors. Apparently can’t get covid colleagues friends. 

That said, Japan significantly better US. I'm us agree fauci made comments recent protests going on?? tried wearing mask cardio, experiment. good. 

If low effort workout okay, needed way oxygen could obtain standard cloth mask stuff like double squats.

Better just..... avoid gym entirely can't wear mask, comfortable people wearing masks. 

I admit, went back gym pay personal trainer, they've got private room away general crowd trainers use. wore mask coaching me. clear, you’re predicting 10x increase total deaths stand today despite fact deaths rapidly declining since April even though new cases remained flat since May.

Let’s math: 

Based current deaths, 884,000 people would need die COVID order reach 7 figure death count.

The average deaths per week past 3 weeks ~5,400, declining, let’s assume deaths flatten simplicity.

That means take 164 weeks, 3 years 2 months, order US reach 1,000,000 COVID deaths.

That’s ridiculous. facts.

These also facts: US authorities say whether plant US would allowed operate not, Chinese authorities. Plants allowed open operate, decision US authorities.

What failed provide support specific claim company owned Chinese interests anything specific plants given approval open US authorities. 

See, debate works - facts nothing specific data points. need able integrate coherent picture. haven't. insinuations, claiming people sort Chinese agents. Neither constitute facts, arguments. Either 

(a) lives equal, including temporally, absolute numbers matter

Or 

(b) lives relative rates matter. lives equal.

Your argument seems trying cake eat too. say testing possibly overrated. article notes Texas hospitalization numbers also increasing. downvoted comment complaining article failed read. Try hospital chef wearing one 8 hours straight even break times. everyone immune immune others *(like POTUS likely gets antibody plasma therapy)* realize “bad faith” includes completely unquestionable I’m belief exclusively posting things validates opinions, matter dubious source? There’s widespread view rest world China lying teeth numbers, like always do. insane generalization. 

I say someone disgusted way US handling pandemic. Shilling China?

You called documented mass imprisonments conspiracy theory lol. Preach!

People idea many police shootings super heated completely justified. never follow details context.

I understand innocent people get shot bad cops terrible things happen one offs. need change sure, missing brain cells think refunding police get results after. Reallocation resources training what's needed. protests+looting New York/Minnesota also 100% Trump’s responsibility, directly governs all... depends whete US living. UK going No. title wrong. New cases doubled total cases. you? going Korea, they're requiring mandatory 14-day quarantine government facility pay 1400 USD out-of-pocket for, matter are.

Worth stay 3+ months. Europe well U would think would act opposite since proves person went place, coincides outbreak among workers almost worse paperwork proving people people want see families partners. mean safer? Countries new infections like lighting match fireworks factory? Ron Perlman lookin pretty good... you? complaints issues cottage country scares live NOVA see many public without masks. Especially Fairfax area  would little worried total deaths declined Well, thankfully, Denmark one them. think continue judicious probably come strict criteria. wait see course! Yeah exponentially growing AL. New cases doubled total cases. title wrong. question ""test positive"" February... Texas. first presumptive positive case Dallas come March 10th. add up, symptomatic mid february... saying tested positive due antibodies coming back positive? know accurate test is... news article, scientific publication, must treat such. Whats difference used “walks of”?
(srs q) want be....terminated. want either. I've go-er since 16, 4-5 days week least. stepping foot gym there's vaccine. never taken break gym long whole life, worth sacrifice. life worth sacrifice. gym one nastiest environments is. Heavy breathing, people wash hands, body fluids everywhere people even wipe equipment. foolish putting environment right now. wonder why. totally agree you. think less Dr Fauci speaking out. 80 years old, him, would let criticisms fly let land will. fired, good hiding office, keeping mouth shut. speak, people take virus seriously anymore, numbers going up. heard Dr Michael Osterholm speak t.v. a.m.. said virus far over. also saying virus infect 70 percent U.S. population over. infectious disease expert 45 years experience. teaches University Minnesota. disgusted lack leadership deadly issue. winds infecting 70 percent population won' anyone left alive age 60. may seem like exaggeration, state live deaths people 65, occasionally hear someone 40 50. always give ages died Maine. worst outcomes world outside Brazil Mexico, fair comparison much larger population. though everyone given caring.I saw poll happiness American people, yesterday. 14 percent Americans said happy. think Covid virus way handled plays number? life knew suddenly came grinding halt. People make U.S flag mask white house! meantime breached 5000 deaths threshold today tomorrow breach 500 deaths/M threshold. 70 deaths/M behind Italy, it’s crazy. He's going Gold's life. probably enjoys conviviality. best words actually noticed rate umbrella usage far higher East Asia West well. u/GovSchwarzenegger one people, restore faith humanity think absolutely lost human race. hope Arnold live long enough see world become better place. know trying make cheap / satirical joke internet, please belittle people legitimate fears victimized past. hear work ourselves. Anger leads frustration leads reactivity short temper (both others). highly recommend meditation darmha. Check Audiodharma.org bswa.org good Yeah, idiotic conspiracy theory bullshit ain't gonna fly sub full people paying attention actually happening real life planet earth.

Good try though. two Vietnams. Lesson learned: never open border one top infected country... Whenever think this: look money pulling opinions. Reopening makes corporations tons money subliminally changing public opinion basic advertisments/fake social media posts/podcasts etc. literally happening right now. science dgaf believe not. Build wall! Build wall! Ok, find single confirmed case fecal-oral transmission millions world I’ll weigh evidence. 

Until then, I’ll remain skeptical it’s statistically meaningful method transmission. “The reality virus us. reality first wave hit small number places — coming every place. It’s coming county city THEATER near you.”  Sure. Every country us get PRC. Tbf it’s percentages never nothing. cause go doesn’t mean throw caution wind. Servers really wearing masks it’s fairly easy way minimize spread server happens get virus. let post direct link so:

Texas: 4098, remove prisoners still 2622

Florida: 2783

Arizona: 2392 Taiwan, too! Yes, I'm completely aware point. believe Fauci probably one foremost experts field, he's involved every (almost) pandemic related event last couple decades I'm aware of, probably things I'm aware well. would actually get better care far reasonable cost. 

Did see American guy literally got charged 1 Million USD hospital bill treatment? Hope y’all fun night! theres fault theres worry.

Also seems bit conspiratorial believe every country axe grind. Correct here's another article Okay booomer... contempt Florida forever cold. Oh please, people talking oppressing minorities done killing millions war putting slums country violently killing policing efforts, imcarcetating high numbers.

But sure, China Duerte. hell not.  reason, thinks human beings intelligent rational.

Apparently, shopping Walmart. hear that? influenza caused influenza virus.  However state borders open so... heard there's tweet celebrity, let's focus now, please?  one said anything one wants deal shit WV. Older people rural areas way less likely wearing masks. grocery store frequent, employee wear mask like 80. redneck dudes also wear masks give people dirty looks wearing them, like they're pissing Trumpy wearing freaking mask lol  *I believe* Charlize Theron give birth first born child. mean everyone else thinks so, agree it. many people impossible remember all. wish Ducey would right thing. Medical professionals begging to, makes difference. Saying reddit trustworthy like saying internet trustworthy. trustworthy information reddit like anything verified sourced. ""the media"". sources trustworthy others even trustworthy media outlets verified sourced.  Ummm, no? going? Even Fred Meyer 50%. Trader Joes near 100%. Even Home Depot I'd say 1/3 more. US doesn’t know this, containment economically profitable? company. doesn’t even make sense company require masks... CORRECT! Unless can't smell anything cos they've already got corona, they're definitely close. Huh, saw thread first thought came mind Harvard expert also said therapy useful acupuncture medications work. body islands named King Felipe II Spain. Las Islas Filipinas. English Felipe Philip. English islands referred Philippine Islands. What’s funny king wasn’t particularly bent colonizing PI (colonizing governor generals sent kept...dying lol). later Spanish colonization, archipelago didn’t really name weren’t really nation. you’re bunch different islands it’s easy kind thing. Anyways Spanish colonization, las Islas Filipinas stuck people referred Filipinos. Spanish language introduced Filipinos begrudgingly. Many priests colony heads saw Filipinos beneath thought Spanish ought reserved elites. lot native filipino dialect blend Spanish words American colonization. Americans Americanized Spanish name Philippines. Finally, later years push formalize national language (it’s mostly Tagalog it’s officially called “Filipino” it’s completely Tagalog language). think English also official language, don’t quote tho. involved creating universal spelling rules make obvious words ought pronounced. believe alphabet initially included P F later included F push universalize language thus Philipino Pilipino became Filipino. sure I’m answering covid sub, yeah think that’s gist. 4 5? like music theory reason 6/8 3/4? population increases, value unique human life decreases? mean? Amazing 8 10 say worried second wave, area 40% people wearing masks based polling. see FOUR CHAOS GODS raise one DEATH riding Binky. Really happy New Yorkers.. imagine scary live city time. hate term ""deep cleaning "" this. Covid hiding. surface. bleach lysol surfaces people touch. aerosol spray talking breathing stay airborne like 10-15 seconds gravity pulls down. adhere surface face level surface within approximately 3 feet face. Room airflow play this. That's wearing mask important. conscious touching.  must vaccine keeping secret. Naw, Trump immune laws thermodynamics. That’s he’s morbidly obese dwaddles walks. 

Gluttony doesn’t lie. looks two friends falling out. Lack brain cells People less cancer go doctor. bad needles administer it. Womp, womp. Holy fuckin shit! Corona virus rapture following people doing. Social distancing matter, get mad digested media. Take them. There's quote vladimir lennin encapsulates 2020 pretty well,

&amp;#x200B;

 

# “There decades nothing happens; weeks decades happen.” keep things open like are, see peak quite time. ""highest number ever"" headlines like nobody cares read anymore. one podium continues opening play roulette virus. matter time daily recklessness gets infected. reopening response... That's dumb reason done using quoting figures sources say speculating.

Make mind up. accept information fits narrative. office 500 employees. let phases. department (60 people) allowed 15, 19 25 people building one time. sign day ahead. wear masks, paper towels open doors, etc. 

Why would company want employees sick especially together ? science determined might come Wuhan, China, many countries would probably cry ""fake news"".

In likelihood, investigation would likely see Americans Brita tamper process manufacture ""proof"" Chinese. see comment thread, guidelines say isn’t proven masks help.

[WHO mask  Right international travel reintroduce virus back region. Take New Zealand instance. functionally free COVID19. remains vulnerable long travel occurs. 

So herd immunity safe vaccine, least effective therapy severe symptoms, disease remains danger large number people - even rate mortality low, multiplied population millions, that’s many deaths riding top “expected” mortality causes. Holy shit didn’t know Scarface got corona! world trying tell people unnecessary harmful religion is. huh? It’s positive feedback loop. rainforest one last massive carbon sinks world. Burning adds effects climate change less available biomass take carbon. Genius Stable! full reopening toll reaches 100,000? convince someone buy them. amount money riding finding buyer really worrisomely high. It’s called stringing masses along keep economy stock market propped up. knew it. knew it. Many researchers main COVID sub knew it... It’s easy thing do. hey, pushing narrative bought time, right? Goal accomplished. now... “it magically disappear.” job well done want impeach governor it?? insanity considering happening states? one thankful strict reopening. That's pure speculation though Nothing - virus is... everywhere. every city now, daily reports total prevalence? this? moving people god damn street get hit semi truck. people think odds good, refuse stay inside even demand others come street them. That's we're looking at. Earlier year #nnevvy incident Chinese people trying troll half dozen Asian nations insulting governments people countries laughing agreed governments suck. shows level indoctrination critical one's government misunderstanding people's relationships governments. taxpayers compensate... Ah yes, virus mostly kills 60+ old people health problems completely change society forever. /s

The Spanish flu killed millions far deadly. Yet life went back normal 2 years. People right already acting like pandemic went away. seriously doubt major societal changes following pandemic. Maybe masks normalized western countries way contact tracing temperature checks 2 years that. surprised arrogant stock plasma infected people take care symptoms that's mild. I'm sure Trump cares life -- he's known germaphobe. We'll find horrible things they've done next democratic president elected. 1918 first wave Spanish Flu knocked mostly old weak people. second wave changed and, due cytokine storms like seen COVID cases, targeted healthy people 20s 30s much deadlier.

So, uh, anyway... woke felt nauseated, thought drank much something. started feeling cold, unusual me. checking temp twice day slightly high, 99.3. next day still felt chilled, want get bed, much appetite, still didnt feel bad enough worried. night temp hit 99.9, decided would get tested next morning. symptoms mild. Bit shortness breath, mild sore throat seemed come go, mild fever. tested Saturday, got call today. asymptomatic since saturday afternoon /sunday.   Yup~ dont get 50cents write stuff here, idea credit system  cool tennents good shape, idea people rent they're broke afford home kinda fucked. Rich get richer paying lot money would rent equity poor people pretty much throwing money void. I'm top 25% credit card bills 30-40% usual. great. good economy, miss going restaurants bars, excellent budget paying debt building savings. Well started looking things shocked they're taking zero precautions. looked numbers. 

The town Grandpa lives 54k residents town 133k. currently 327 cases coronavirus 374. Clearly talking precautions. orange? hand. testament opening high risk no-mask businesses like restaurants bars bad idea.  people, like described mom, can't mentally process risk.  matter carefully explain them, open, they'll go, keeping infection rates forever high, dragging whole crisis lockdown cycle forever let them.

And look places like Australia endured short hard lockdowns go back everything football matches.  Oof. people things, make them. He's fucking governor. Sure, use power politically convenient abandon responsibility not. idiots like Abbott idiot friends like president call leadership. fucking tools know leadership bit ass. bad people stupid still support assholes. see interpretation. Could case taking poorly worded expression context. Thanks!  time Halloween. festive. Meh much. I'm coming realize much miss socializing, I'd rather friends get Post Intensive Care Syndrome. Protests pretty good test. May. proud city! hope infected Toronto folk come fuck us since reached phase 2 yet.   really really hate response. sound like lazy asshole

“Yeah COULD prevent deaths better hey, people die car crashes cancer gunshots every year care die silly little disease?”

Like people get cavalier death? People dying could’ve lessened even prevented... fellow Americans citizens dying horrible deaths unable breath cases see loved ones take final breath.

And prevented. slowed down. less it’s going be. don’t people seem care? 

You part problem. care human life? talking indoor spread. protests def exacerbated it, we're talking hundred thousand (?) Protestors vs 340 million Americans thinking ok work. They’re right  someone knows India well, story really resonated me, points major problems India average person accessing health care.

The story BBC journalist, Roxy Gadgekar Ahmedabad, sister (Covid19 positive) brother law (who dies Covid19).

The journalist recounts use “influence” reach powers get admitted hospital, even get test!

As journalist writes, “***If experience, happening millions others levels access did?***”

Even though story Ahmedabad Gujarat, one severely Covid19 affected areas, access decent, adequate health care remains pipe dream vast majority Indians. Many die Covid19, without ever tested, leave alone treated, Covid19. even make statistic death Covid19. Thx Obama. FWIW commercial real estate going crash hard soon. Many landlords dip fingers commercial residential.

And sad economy dipping, landlords fucked always good thing.

Sorry landlords, evict someone 30 days notice residents allowed dip 30 days notice. fair Didn’t really low death count today? really understand people dumb. mean got examples millions people going bars restaurants lockdowns causing 0 problems. Still apparently respect distances wear masks. renewed February I'm salty US, requirement. take as:
NOT: ""If stop testing, we'd zero cases"" 
INSTEAD: ""We know many cases we'd great job testing"" Yeah. donated money him. First time ever that. Yeah seems like people threads really aware much tech pays days... entry-level SWEs FAANG land 170k+ straight undergrad, next nobody *only* earning 90k unless they're getting fuckload illiquid equity important question albeit one definitive answer many people died Covid would still alive today virus.

Based data appear many. won’t be, think we’ve hit point people can’t mentally comprehend death rate. 100k, 200k. lizard brain doesn’t see difference. doubt there’s number fatalities would convince average American another lockdown, it’s clear government wouldn’t give us support pathetic 1200 months lost income don’t ask 50 dollar discount ? worse say . can't imagine barrista retail employee government employee make ends meet there.

I get many people get something pays still need people. fact, steroids could make infections worse cases, helping virus replicate, said.

Jesus christ, yeah, never thought part (idiots trying take prevention). I'm doctor everything I've absorbed COVID19 says want suppress immune system week one steroids. later, cytokine storm/immune response going nuts killing you. First say article? Second off, could *anyone* know they’ll fine healthwise virus actually runs it’s course? People seem faux notion you’re 65 underlying conditions it’s nothing that’s simply case. virus unleashed hell upon even killed people 30s 40s. THATS likely he’s downvoted, there’s guarantee they’ve cleared virus This, quality comment. No, majority dementia decline begins person admitted facility families generally hold long possible.

It seems like don’t good understanding it’s like trying care patients advanced dementia... 

I friends work dementia ward incredibly mentally physically taxing. Physical even sexual assaults staff members uncommon, can’t send people prison, could completely different person 10 minutes later. Trained staff sadly best option, families simply don’t support experience handle situations come regularly dementia patients. 47 yesterday 45 today according Worldometers clearly know look understand data Enclosed, exercising, sharing air hours time Hey read statements DeSantis see make sense says... far less positivity rate places rest country! feel same. It’s late. direct result 300 years meditated action. undone overnight. fact people happy present “lesser two evils” viable argument talking electing *President* testament this. People used getting fucked okay it. America already saw best days. It’s downhill here. live NJ real estate prices homes within reasonable commute Manhattan rising sharply. Wealthy apartment owners city want get quarantined city again. Good time sell live NJ. think fall would great long term buy NYC. 99% people denial; exists, believe exists, people **refuse believe could/or get sick** get saying agree important accurate. said, underlying full statement notion U.S. *could* stop testing confirmed cases would vanish. disturbing rational people even considers scenario worth discussing. say all? entertained idea possible policy?

So concerned taken context, discredits mindlessly repeat it. Trump still fully on-the-record complaining testing making administration look bad less testing would make look better. That's morally repugnant yet that's ultimately people interpret quote. Sure, that's fine. Let's use real per capita data then, rolling 7 day average Tegnell said representative. link:

archive.vn/ExivL

Sweden: 3.14

Denmark: 0.12 (26x less)

Norway: 0.08 (39x less)

Finland: 0.05 (63x less)

So actually, even go looking figures make Sweden look worst, happened ones hand. rolling seven day average gives best picture things currently going. such, see Sweden FAR worse neighbors still, becomes clear want keep borders closed Sweden can.  OP forgot tag ""Good News."" hell no. decision leave schools open literally killed teachers. Non senior deaths population centers (eg Stockholm) among worst world.

I dont believe you.

I watching Sweden's numbers pretty closely.

Currently, 5041 deaths 190 60yrs old.

So get thing ""Non senior deaths population centers (eg Stockholm) among worst world.""? wasn’t trying talk it, commenting difference prices throughout country. Fingers crossed get sweet pad Portland good price. Best luck you. except bay rea Probably. It’s Copenhagen. Ishøj Glostrup harder hit Copenhagen C Fredriksberg. They’re also less densely populated. I’d think demographics socio-economic factors it’s 800 4000 people per square km. Yeah meanwhile everything local hardware store grocery store getting expensive.... also, rent went so... fuck this. don’t understand making big decisions based entirely surface level informations.

Most people, regardless race, surface level info. problem black community also history humanity denied, harder us trust ""the experts"" tell us. I'm saying mistrust always warranted, reason. hate frustrates me, *I get good decisions requires people look deeper mechanics what’s happening real time.

That's whole point article, bringing information communities make better decisions based facts. seems like saying, ""Why look science?!"" science readily available people sea misinformation propaganda. think I'm pretty discerning, I've still duped times. say NY, mean city state whole? Last place well market value, rent raised $25 5 years. nice. writing billion dollar doomsday bunker. gonna infections. unless entire team gets infected something like that, aren’t shutting It’s really open though. Partially - maybe yes. sincerely hope never happens attendees people get sick daily higher likelihood catch it. top everyone said, NYC 20%+ positive antibody rate. protests drew significantly younger demographics even higher average immunity virus previous exposure recovery showing little symptoms. explains absence sudden uptick positive cases. definitely ready roll back soon see cases spike. Looking states reopened, developing situation AZ, TX, FL serves fair warning. they've got two weeks time decide shut down, considering they're shutting yet gonna 2 weeks. gonna interesting july texas is? level reopening county in? Restaurants bars open dine in? masks required? market artificially inflated. Yeah, major cities. suburbs, going up. Wednesday’s DHHS update showed hospital system room patients 79% state’s hospital beds 77% ICU beds currently Though hospitals enough capacity now, Cohen said “if react hospitalizations, time get close maxing hospitalizations, could late.” I’m kinda laughing loud thought family booking trip Disney it’s even open. Thank reason science based comments. easier admit point rather move goal posts town? think look bad large portion student population starts getting COVID? Working conditions (small distance, cold, rarely 
air exchange,) ; living conditions (makes self isolation joke) , workers often cramp together cars drive plants often work multiple plants time , .... 
Imo slaughterhouses might best working environment spreading virus found yet, especially cold seems accelerator . big feeling half west Reading shit like makes happy house tiny villiage. 3 inside 1 outside cats, 2 dogs, 3 polish chickens, 2 saltwater reef tanks snake. Fuck, pet rent would cost rent rent. Good word I'm little different. said lockdown, understand implemented first place. Similarly, appreciate line ""masks work except health care workers"" touted - limited supply, look humans regards toilet paper beginning.

Now, though, mass producing masks ready release. beginning, lockdown, honest - there's enough PPE people, enough data allow life carry on, need buy time. whole bunch journal articles, recent submitted preprints, disagree you. science really is, clear. live somewhere annual guideline increases? Toronto landlord apply government rate (usually 1.8-2.2%). apply guideline increase prove e.g. repairs, new amenities, etc. question is, long go ignoring problem pretending there? Well... won’t start seeing forced evictions July believe. It’s fucked up, people forced units emptied pricing theoretically improve. Obviously, hope people don’t end homeless it’s almost inevitable given expensive LA already is. It’s going rough couple months city. I've heard literally opposite. Oven bad, steam good claim adamant based pictures people heard from, maybe 2/3 wore masks. Probably good time feel well, tell fun extra curricular event. sad feel well can't make live outside NYC. Prices going since everyone leaving city. Wait what? die fire. Nuclear warfare loss everybody  Get ready Portlanders hate move gotten note recently landlord saying raising anyone's rents year. first time raised rents years here. county open numbers going up, suspect someone close us dies ends hospital, won’t believe it. I’m afraid tell someone, I’m guy fuck macho bullshit Interesting. rent changed all, house prices actually gone May compared May 2019. interesting see things develop here. (Norway) course. Sweden stands own. ""special"".

Yet people like took one look Swedish ""strategy"" said months ago ""it work"". know, right.

OK then... let's compare ""Real Sweden"" ""Predicted Sweden"".

The Swedish government said focusing energy protecting risk. Guess what? failed. admit failed.

The Swedish government predicted herd immunity Stockholm May. wrong. admit wrong.

The Swedish government said goal ""flatten curve"". latest figures prove failed too.

The Swedish government's ""strategy"" failed every way based said would happen, versus actually happened.

But suppose going say Sweden can't even compared predictions/goals, now. Maybe varieties flu, migratory birds vector. evidence reason believe COVID-19 work like that. ""Waves"" going entirely due collective behavior. Keep mind LA (and full LA metro area) huge extremely diverse socioeconomic perspective... household making 60k generally living West LA, they're living east LA inland. COVID Death Count Inflated | Change Mind

I'm denying number people got COVID put death certificate one causes death misleading (or outright false) so. 

That said, think also fair say number people died COVID complications outside hospital, due lack tests unable verified, get COVID listed cause death. 

They probably equal out, even death count inflated, think much people would like think.  long places .  fave: folk sub arguing spike Arizona big deal totes enough hospital capacity fearmongering doomers. 

2400 cases one state. China would welding everyone apartments homes happened there. deaths rising? No, they're lower ever. overblown. Fuck fearmongering. Someone anyway! Itmight prod people wearing save lives definitely lot misery ill 'mild' case. back exponential growth. is. 

yesterday's death count near 300. states trying Brazil, ones highest numbers cases. Hope see better evidence soon (hopefully, positive one) Dunno tight is, given propensity many red side engage in, shall say, less-than-Christian pursuits side? I’m ER doc north Dallas. confirm shit’s getting bad here. makes worse testing still really bad. real idea bad actually is. Right now, abbot claims numbers going increased testing, increase we’re seeing seems outpacing increase testing. Yeah.... hit deductible. expect they'll cover jack shit then. thought fair question. right. biological attack, would lost war. Crazy literally overnight pandemic ended Yes, luckily everyone needs new lungs it, might problematic. I'm implying happens everyone gets it, find interesting case, one might help people realise extent permanent damage cause, especially we're still lacking long-term data. fucking shit, China, way go limb put others kind risk almost everything do.

I'm concerned second wave ass. Fuckers breathing right neck waiting line go stores masks. based fact virus hasn’t impacted people’s day day life much. told would, didn’t. people percentage wise affected. Yet prevention measures affected everyone. wear mask stay home mostly, honestly think virus simply wasn’t bad feared initially. Haven’t seen anything prove otherwise. Definitely.

Sinovec vaccinating hotel workers Beijing Two Sessions last month. kept secret. sub quarantine enthusiasts must jumping joy. Imagine that, year lockdown, quarantines freedom robberies. paradise. saying possibility know barely anything virus includes can't say certain always possibility treating virus like exist would first start. america Please, guys, re-elect Nov. From, rest world. Mylar, cellulose. point people information need. say let stupid people cull themselves. China “out woods” 

Just like Europe “out woods” 

Too funny lie. lied covid, allowed spread. pay everything many million dollars home worth turn immune covid-19? goddamn moron protect making difficult touch face. Advise wearing glasses. Fortunately China build wall. Good luck guys :-) Funny that's also view China too. thought US decline, would take succession bad presidents, maybe recoveries ""great men"" would try hardest reverse trend. Basically like second half Qing dynasty played out. like even Western Roman Empire declined people like Stilicho stepping forward try hold things best could.

Trump turning uniquely capable causing damage country. again, many bankruptcy companies through? would different he's running US like one companies. Exactly! hard people figure out? Japan, we're wearing inside, pull take bite pop back place. They're correct. Yup, Easter 2023. problem finding parking church year.  So, 2-4 weeks longer expected speed sadly picking alot. 2000 dead one day knows many unreported. bigger news younger generation realise you’re unlikely die doesn’t mean body won’t get ruined - might cautious Together stronger!!! I've putting seats flushing probably 15 years now, ever since saw Mythbusters episode particles come toilet flush. guess get inured anything time. whole COVID-19 thing first broke out, thought back influenza epidemic early 20th century literally killed millions people within years, wondered everyone could kind ... move past that. get why. giant clusterfuck WWI influenza top that, bet people kind got used deaths. 

It's surreal how, couple months ago, arguing dad serious would be. insisting big deal 100 cases US. numbers large they're basically meaningless me. Well, I'm doctor, stats (BMI 24.8) put upper range would considered ""normal"" weight height. ideal weight would around 170 average build fitness. yeah, sure, listen doctor drop 10 pounds.. gain 10, considered overweight. could stream workouts online people would 100% watch imagine quarantined china possible medical nightmare contract recover there

Yes, can. Better PPEs, experienced medical staff, bill easily pay month's salary? know secret service thoroughly vets institutes whatever dipshit rules assholes setting foot place. Ie, likely forbade anyone serving staff wear mask around cronies.

Also, understand hangup mask wearing restaurants. people really figure pull take bite/sip, put back place? mean, somehow literally billions Asians managing decades, Christ's sake. That's great. Really frustrating US controversial politically charged many places. hit final testing phase one July hitting last trial testing 30k people know dude on. soft spot Florida, lived 4 years.

I'm horrified man, complete disregard reality means people. People literally going die dude can't yield LiBRulz.

Horrific, horrific, horrific. become people. gonna back two weeks what? pandemic. Fred Meyer worst grocery stores mask compliance. agree that. yeah. spot anti-science types fairly easily. I’m alien invasion. fuck even vaccines hitting phase 3 last testing phase looking likely could vaccine end year early next year. Freedom essential. point saving future without freedom.

Really people act like openly desire someone big whip ruling you. find that... Disgusting. Hahahaha, well played! Arnold. Great advices! Idris saying big deal?  So, 2-4 weeks longer expected speed sadly picking alot. 2000 dead one day knows many unreported. Ironic, since Arnold probably contributed early US covid Yes get tested contact confirmed case self isolate. Also let anyone potentially infected know. China mandatory 14-day quarantine too. quarantine nucleic acid test free foreigners , sure whether still free now. One said Trump ordering meat plants remain open actually sums situation easily overlooked. main argument flex production continue operating smaller scale. one little thing missing one man works plant infect others shut entire factory. Even positive symptoms, need quarantine everyone continue operating hiding cases, blackmailing employees work even though dangerous lie making workplace safe (you can't that, since case covid eanough one employee diarrhea common bathroom, takes mask coughs alone somewhere...). sure spread via meat send sold, maybe someone sneezed package. So, reasonable amount worry basis argument wrong unless employers lie, downplay risk simply people desperate enough work. Probably different combinations holding together falls apart. forgot demand also shifting, people scared buy meat infected plant (even prove can't get way), turn cheaper food etc chances smaller farmers develop relationship local community based trust convenience (not visiting huge supermarkets higher chances getting virus). lot people move country side able sustain living city due unemployment. reality is, one really knows, let's wait see. disease joke. live NYC know several people infected. people get mild symptoms, others get severely ill. It’s crap shoot really

It kill old people. Young people risk well. Alabama like 800 moving average... like 6 million people live whole state. catastrophically bad numbers. Churches opening graduations held soon well. Nah, time America alone. better ""sick Covid."" many state governments confirmed 1 (to put mildly) case can’t trace source infection.

Do exceed 10 percent number? No, don't. far prime minister giving pressers, India’s probably worst crisis right history prime minister courage face questions give unscripted answers puts skills ability handle situation doubt. remember media 4th pillar democracy PM totally avoiding direct questions puts big question mark behind respecting values democracy idea India.

Okay, believe so. wear masks still spread would second wave. consequences would lessened, It’s insane think transmission lack mask wearing. worried, worse gets, supporters blindly put trust him. mind-boggling, vile dumb shit does, endearing supporters. insane many stupid people exist on
Earth, listen talk ass tell people ""disinfect inside"", nod heads agreement. RUH ROW Agreed, US far beyond point containment.

Dramatic containment put fire early stage, fire widespread, measures taken containment stage lose meanings. Small dick energy. Well breathe non stop basically. defecate nonstop well? US lockdowns prevented deaths, delayed them. deaths, plus trapped home misery top. profitable, lot cases.

Not anymore. Doomers exist. Similarly, commented virus care ""people need live lives""
And got dimwitted people care afraid virus. So... Friendly reminder Fauci force meetings go public himself. Please don’t hit “bUt sTaY tRuMp GooD sIde wAnT FiRed” prime candidate get tested. ASAP. house fire invite detective check fire origin, concentrate putting fire first? ~~people~~ ~~immigrants~~ slaves Mexico. Yeah.... think AZs *anything.* want keep job 2 months sick leave every year tiny ignorable illnesses? isn't. cure disease. reduce death rate. body still needed beat disease.

Nonetheless, still happy work. Idk. way older populations dying right now. would enough drive extinction months U.S. pandemic control? would wear non-stop, chance allways here. Except know are, turns certainty.

By logic excuse freedom infringement, ""society deems responsible""

It fine society tell ""we want wear mask"" also fine say ""no"". one hand can’t believe idiot actually said that, yet another I’m absolutely surprised. Strange times we’re living lol First wave ain't got time second wave! That’s bs. It’s common misinformation spread mask wearing. seems like logical reason. Completely crappy reason, makes sense. directly impede thing keeping us alive, aka breathing.

You remove waste products live.

 things comparable all.

They absolutely are. fact, there's actual scientific justification wearing masks clothing covers genitalia purely feels. someone feel need parrot fucking sentence every thread?

Here’s new fact you: hummingbirds birds fly backwards. Kinda shocked know Pence. politicians there, he's one closest Satan's actual spawn. 50x worse Trump probably reason one's outright killed Agent Orange yet.  7 days 1 hour wirelass charge. $300-$400US. seem forget Trump mentioned caveat: goes away stop testing. exponential growth rate running, again.  

""... health officials said residents following recommendations keep social distance, avoid large gatherings wear mask public places.""

I blame people.  blame officials failing communicate clearly frequently.  want people something, must repeat instruction clearly often enough every hear understand.  Get news shows, every day, six times day. 

Either that, start thinking lock-down, again. cough self-sustaining long initial cause gone. get cold, cough lot, coughing irritates throat, 3 weeks runny nose symptoms gone still coughing throat raw coughing. joe rogan said masks bitches? Government lie citizens! /$  ....I think might said extrovert... not, friend much shoes. Facebook turned significant portion country insane. That’s hyperbole exaggeration. People’s brains turning mush Facebook going able get country going places keep shut like area. keep spreading around fake disease. lot fear mongering. trying say wake get act together beat virus. Showing numbers going say come see working. Americans. 

\*whole world except White House. currently Where? I’ve staring Azdhs page days that’s looked me.  not. directly impede thing keeping us alive, aka breathing. things comparable all. Russia contain eventually. contrary, think many seen anti-“Big Pharma” videos aware read legislation preventing it. Title reads like arson, murder jaywalking. offense countries involved xD I'm betting trends. NY harder surpass, certainly possible. rest easy surpass. far 150,000 deaths time unless miracle vaccine therapy next 3-4 months. Death counts rising. Covid tally passed number deaths WW1 (116,000). Anyone wanna estimate WW2 deaths (407,000) due? I’ve literally never done this, agree Trump’s words taken context here. snippet everyone quoting last two days quite bit different said here. Don’t fooled rocks got Maybe best. imagine mild symptoms. He'd downplay even worse. Australia US wanted China investigated source virus, China agree countries could considered part origin virus investigation. see anything wrong China's demand. hope Canada adopts Washington. Oregon California. finally candian. I'm saying US WWI deaths made men 20s; presumably would've thrown bunch senior citizens there, death toll would've higher.

We're comparing apple oranges WWI &amp; covid deaths Yes, overrun stopped economy told everyone stay home. 

I hope I’m wrong saw happen NYC let virus run unchecked. 'Murica don’t know people surprised. point we’re like 4 months people normal lives. Apathy fully taken over. Anyone tell “yeah I’m 100% content” fucking lying. Selfish people elect selfish politicians kill incompetence mismanagement. Democracy action. Oh God. I'm fucking dead man. Oh way that, suffer lasting damage even ""severe"" case. Someone know pretty sick Covid badly enough hospitalized, heart problems apparent before. shit joke. know people since expert job. strict laws preventing it. Pharma hire someone consultant, askthem questions prescribe, pay “fair market value” (meaning enough pay fairly, extravagantly) time. 

That’s employment relationship means. Remember good ole days everyone thought 1/4th people idiots. wholly missing message. I’m agreeing message, idea printing flag mask would’ve greatly helped incredibly shortsighted.  Like... real, America gonna collapse virus? believe US wanted China investigated origin virus China agree unless included every country. confused thought US implemented plan would eliminated virus here. also mistaken think complete lockdown sustainable economy 2 months, let alone years. Morally sucks failing/downside economy, fact. Moreover vaccine may fact ever happen may years off. lying thought anything providing hospitals/research/government chance prepare happening. work one, masters level medical degree, access lots information system wide medical planning. None us thought anything pause occurring.

I advocating packed live concerts, wearing masks, even really people much indoors large groups. want avoid hard exponential rise cases. said limited contact select friends and/or family getting outside interact reasonable distancing precautions fine IMO, least local given number cases. Feel free cloister feel risk high someone family. numbers go exponential threaten overwhelm system likely restrict again, going get out. Unfortunately suppress immune system.

Weak COVID patient + usually elderly + even immunodepressant

I know willingly accept term tbh. Outside vaccines (which list separately), even viruses gone away due mechanism? They've tested dipshit [Me state Lol define death Korean American relative thinks he’s second coming Jesus save Christians atheism Muslims.

They may smartest people,but know self preserve. John Campbell (UK) said that, extrapolating current deaths per capita Sweden, expect nearly million deaths U.S.

And that's current number Sweden, final one.  former California governor ""will stay clear Gold's people start wearing masks floor — there's vaccine,"" TMZ said.

I believe may find people taking differently ""he work out"". confirm. least large portion Vietnamese American still praising news denies covid pandemic hoax.

I watched video covid protest month ago woman said virus bad China neighbor countries China like Spain Italy (yeah know, quote hers). 

It amazed people blind within country.

Source: family living US right yeah, support Trump. Weird, douche bag would rather see citizens die admit ignored signs failed miserably controlling pandemic. trump POS, he's POTUS. It’s shit show America, lack leadership highest levels we’re leading world deaths new cases. matter happens, Governor Abbott would like remind us absolutely fault conceivable fashion.  Goodness, story! know I'll ever shop Ross again!

I agree gyms death-trap waiting happen. Especially now, $10 month gyms *crammed* tight strip mall spaces. could see gym area super high ceilings wide open spaces equipment spaced far enough apart, places like planet fitness iron oxygen curves gyms. People breathing other's space. Sweaty bodies. Gross. Americans self-interested value anyone else's life.   thought immunity said 4-6 month range? international students (which state second biggest industry construction, think biggest export) come mandatory hotel quarantine. That’s exactly expected, though. EXPECT cases open things up, right? It’s common sense.

However, idea flatten curve. Meaning, want create huge spike people needing hospitalization surpass capacity. people getting sick, expected, doesn’t mean till going overwhelm hospitals. 

For example, let’s say knew sure 1 million people get sick. stay lockdown period time, people get sick time, thus overwhelm hospitals. open back up, people get sick high rate, still stay hospitals capacity. goal entire time, people seem forgetting that. supposed locked goes away, frankly, doesn’t look like it’s every going go away it?

It also important note actual amount people needing COVID-19 hospitalization FRACTION predicted. Although impossible, it’s pretty safe say overloading hospitals. Yay living Washington. ordered /reasonable/ amount supplements fear shortage actually need them. still around? update apocalypse date? comparing UK Thailand appears eradicated too? similar population size/density first cases way UK. elderly die young. test widespread infection finding. 

For example employers testing employees, contact tracing. weren’t alerted severity Covid hit nursing Washington state, although percolating population I'm surprised New Zealand even opened borders everything going world first world countries seem manage better us. shitty country society? Mickey Minnie: ok Alec Baldwin characters might something. well, know working theory...hypothesis maybe....

for worth, 14.9 percent New York State covid antibodies..in studies done there......the current positives 13 percent implied number.

would anyone surprised? know impossible get tested months ago. 

i doubts long term immunity, however. guy work, falls second group described, tell knew guy healthy exercised lot died heart attack 45 therefore healthy anything. 

It somewhat eye opening speaks real lack understanding. think lot people shallow depth thought something like ""Experts say X. Experts got new information want modify X"" proves ""experts"" know anything. still tell people 6feet cool, know isn't? Huh. must right. There's way assume everything going world, chinese owned company would make sure product made country time dire need. 

This really full debate forum. place people state opinions pretend important lmao wants go restaurant means can't hang grandma without rather significant risk getting sick?

Plus, economy needs people spend money. Old people spend money too. 1,239 last Tuesday... Got source that? Testing FL actually peaked mid-May around 45-55k. tested 30k yesterday 21k day reference. Dont forget Gov Gregg Abbott said disappointed young people, forced state Texas open. asshole. people strong ethical dilemmas one works always testing them. narrative now? 

WE NEED TESTING!!!

MORE TESTING BAD!!! 

Jesus sub psychotic. higher, lot states disclosing many deaths nursing homes. places U.S. mask wearing policies reasonably strict enforcement. Gold's gym mask policy, apparently believed universal. Instead certain common areas enforced workout areas. swear headline published every week time people comment exact shit. worth even removes virus's fangs. It'll become one many shitloads viruses floating around coming around annoy us while. Jack Lilian better shape 90 I’ve probably ever except maybe one small time. Can't forget papayas Gov. Ivey little shy genius herself, bar ""smart"" might need little adjusting. Right? don’t get it. It’s nice see friends I’d much rather drinks small group house around bunch sweaty strangers potentially deadly virus floating around. Like y’all can’t wait 6 months year go back bar? topic title begging answer. Remember life pandemic? okay sharing one dirty restaurant menu never washing hands. Maybe speak like moron would easier follow hes talking about. almost large public gatherings bad idea Living campus thing Australia unless country moved city. Even it’s exception rule (people get share houses instead). Living campus seems American thing work well it? Except he's wartime president entire time, Obama. US war Afghanistan since 2001. ""Yesterday morning 9 a.m., four hospitals saying saturated already, 9 o’clock morning Monday, usually see summertime,"" Dr. David Persse, Houston Public Health Authority said. even tried lol mean... way American airport security line safety?  is, take half airport.  plain recirculating air. I’m sure Orlando Newark pay everything dystopian touch screens cameras shoved face.  Doesn’t feel terribly sanitary. Intolerance American way seems days. Even people sit outside restaurants taking sidewalks(not sitting standing around like it’s bar) literally walk traffic. Life little different sooner accept better. It’s forever. Germs feeling disenfranchised. scumbag. Thailand seems done 70 million people they're island. think logic everything running normal internally without tourism vaccine developed. herd immunity kills elsewhere. international travel still happen strict enough procedures. perfect economy starts ticking course nobody's dying covid... consider reporting them. making restaurant safe employees, whole unemployment/volunteering thing seems illegal fuck. 

Governments may care safety aspect tend care fraud. Hes mentally 5 going 97 dimentia piece infotainment. It’s hard. day work humid conditions. Surgeons years. It’s way better dead causing someone else die. they'd correct LMAO sattire think started such, definitely lot evidence suggest virus used great opportunity so. fact many people easily willing go along whatever told do, without questioning why, frightening. 

A months ago, said June, government would make mandatory everyone walk around banana arses, 99.9% people would said, 'no way'. 

I sure today. here. WP said allowing every access covid 19 articles. Nah, hear ya. disposable mean. US could verify KN95s legit, I'd fine using those. half mask Yes tests finding cases

Actually found convenient lie people spreading try play numbers big deal. Daily testing nearly every state peaked mid-May. Since states flat even dropping. vary greatly day day, course.

You click state see daily testing numbers: instance, FL peaked mid-May 55k tests. last days FL tested 30k, 21k, 38k. That's certainly impression got headline.

Total clickbait. article barely newsworthy, celebrity focus. Yes, I’m noticing also. Even places inconvenience falls someone else, like workers restaurants, people acting annoyed even reminded precautions. compassionate early release all? Compassionate whom? People might get infected die? People lose jobs economy shut again? point responsible compassionate individual asking early compassionate release, matter personal circumstances. move outside. money got money would earned got re-elected. 


If learn anything pandemic, realize nothing compared mighty dollar. leaders, officials, employers would push us cliff meant dollars pockets. Yes quarantine must safeguard people inside WA...tq 😀😇 Omg! Thank you! many mental health drug deaths. Kids isolated getting education. Medical care ignored avoided. Hell, sweet nothing's blank check, I'm sure could. Yes. surgical mask. Obviously public schooling, you’d ideally want online. explain parents children longer child care 5/7 days week? millions families can’t afford nanny everyday? Gov. Ivey faith people Alabama smart wade health crisis.

Rookie mistake. Except states positive test rate staying increasing. See, you’re jokingly referencing him. fucking meant completely seriously. That's I'm saying. Worldometer says 1709468 tests conducted Brazil 929 thousand cases means 50% tests positive. course know up-to-date test numbers Brazil Worldometer are, since lot countries release weekly test numbers daily test numbers. Testing around 1-2.5% covid tests false positives. get isolation sucks, especially live alone (like myself) really desperate go bar pandemic? Like that’s you’ve waiting time, sit beer bunch people don’t think it’s real watching............idk espn ocho? Good. obscenely low, especially considering you’re going confined space least hour 150+ people would kick nuts everyday thinks real live adjacent upper-middle class part city. go neighborhood's grocery store, almost nobody masks nobody obeys one-way signs. least mask helps enforce social distancing, people view masked-me leper.

When drive grocery store modest neighborhood, almost everyone masks obey one-way signs. virus know difference. Right papers much ""academic noise'. Never forget people studying stuff great deal pressure ""publish perish"". going couple years least say anything great deal certainty virus. Let body data build . Right study publishing frenzy. countries think control S. Korea New Zealand looked fine debates Sanders. comments light bulbs disinfectant. We'll see two debate. going geriatric olympics matter context news reporting headlines. Gym Florida opened May 25th. lockdown accounts frozen. wife cancelled gym membership 26th. 

We going get bench dumbbells. full body workout that. Yes, answer question person responded. think you’ll see something weird happen colleges robust online executive programs \~fine\~ already established fee structure faculty ready work, colleges university go broke. might see Business schools trying break state universities, Liberal Fine Arts throw chairs titanic other.

This worst fear university administrators. distance learning shown effective campus learning, schools left market credential (which could easily replaced IQ test) ""college experience"".

Selling $200,000 tough. really try prevent deaths nursing homes. Nursing homes safe. Especially death. makes sense seeing deal 100 outbreak? gives Texas encouragement go Joel Osteen WA done pretty good job containing things far. federal gov opens borders students, able get Perth okay quarantine, worries. P3 filter = P100 yes stops COVID. valve pretty small, smaller half respirators I've used. Exhaled air comes valve middle impacts back speech cone, big opening see.

And trying clear N95 protect wearer - nothing you. I've 30-40 mile bike rides mask since started, really big deal. gotten whatever insane disease mask truthers scream about. Unfortunately isn’t going hit home people see hospitals full denying care. can’t see case numbers tangible sense, see overwhelmed hospital looks like What's deaths per million ny vs fl. Florida 10x lower. would still cool lift with! Click Orlando, cant find mainstream sources corroborate number statement governor. sure it’s correct? wear face shield that. face shield goes surgical mask. mask prevents spread disease shield prevents bodily fluids coating them. 

They don’t want fluids eyes forehead anymore want mouth. It’s ok, glad we’re page haha advertise $25.00, more, wearing mask. people think wear mask would apt discount. People love discounts (why Kohl's successful). everyone get discount flying mask on. Flying miserable enough without wearing mask. United going need try get people want fly again. offer promotion makes wearing mask seem like saving money keeping safe? said first case reported June 3 cases trickling past week half.

on June 3rd, Sheboygan County 98 cases. 166 cases. Based death statistics like fifth story today involving idiots churches spreading rona? went Target today (Twin Cities, MN region) customers wearing masks, unfortunately. link list activities? I'd love read it. didn’t party numbers AZ raising. What’s point? every office I’ve ever worked they’ve brought people flu shots every fall. never used meant going way always do.

I wish businesses this! keep seeing morons intentionally take masks sneeze/cough. guy dumbass. Law &amp; Order: Viral Outbreak Unit I'm attacking without Shiiiit. terrible numbers. busted. lost qualifications section leader three times. Put hack twice me. history high-speed passes five air-control towers one admiral's daughter! 600k bill insurance company reimbursed like 20k pay significant portion 20k copays. numbers bills designed high insurance companies pay pennies dollar. uninsured, responsible full charges even try negotiate pay something like 100% less Medicare reimbursement, which, again, pennies dollar. stupid system designed extract much possible payment sources obfuscating true price. sort like employer want anyone discuss salaries market rate effectively hidden. I'm Japanese relation Sweden even completely understand focus ridiculous harmful Sweden's approach been. basically one best examples everything do. Yeah corona virus turns lights they’re good unfortunately. happens people sick dying.....you economy either. Trump’s taking therapeutic plasma people antibodies effectively immune. rest family Pence, too. 

This conspiracy hypothesis I’m sticking it.  ""Dr. Fauci Says Spoken POTUS Coronavirus Pandemic Two Weeks""  I'll bet Trump asked people Who's dying this? Minorities? vote me. 

Reopen let die. may interested pandemic, pandemic interested you.

&amp;#x200B;

(With apologies Leon Trotsky.) Well that’s good since coronavirus sub. Harvard studies pointed towards 1.7% decreased spread disease every degree 77 degree Fahrenheit. see there, there’s disclaimer whatsoever, post basically misinformation. Would hate fellow redditors glance title assume situation Florida right now. article two months ago didn’t age well. Huh? Pretty simple post alleging edited massively, you’re either making confusing another post. give benefit doubt assume latter. 

Oh, someone calling loser social media effect me. It’s actually kind funny would judge quality human based post gave helpful research tips. Good day, sir. Yeah sorry break states run liberal govt cases decreasing... Seattle included worry. riot wear surgical mask, immune!


...I'll take ban hammer now, mods. Water fucking wet People afford healthcare uninsured use physician's ofgices retail pharmacies. Corona-chan's deep-throat America's wang. - Michael Scott it’s same

unless went Lynch’s bar used murphy’s law quote also don’t get body fluids flung face. province 7 days cases, idk that's risk take haha talking victim's employers never fail profit everything Haha actually thinking Brienne. remember story finishes without big ‘what?!?’ me. Though guess Hound’s end alright. 

And lmao trains thought like too. Id petting dog Id think Jon petting Ghost, thought going back North end disappearing forever, get disappointed lol.

Side note: still disappointed never got wight Hodor! gets killed wights presumably he’s army. Would’ve cool Yup work medicine well.  Guilt/fear trip work here. well aware danger disease. denial fact fucked response given up. going hide house society going work together, proven not. 

You sound like good person frustrated badly handled totally agree with.  I, however, done pretending plan reason anything besides wearing ppe avoiding large crowds. spend years house, going given response taken. Happy Cake Day! agree. 

I’m totally happening. would like see comprehensive plan preventative measures put place decisions made. Pence's statement age like milk?

!remindme 3 months china knows Herd immunity ur dreams wow almost like pandemic situation. People tout low CFR like fact people tested outcome recorded, 12% died. Maybe get serious enough symptoms bother getting tested. get bad enough you’ll 12% chance dying. Less you’re younger you’re older. Er. times predictions optimistic. Pretty sure hit 100k deaths ahead schedule.

You seem super angry I’m gonna back away now. Hope nice evening. article 2 months old N95 highest level, filters 95% particulates. People complain media fear mongers, report news is, say they’ve forgotten lol. I'm believing data Brazilian government goddamn corruption scandals involving campaign hospitals.  what's supposed happen - government pay incomes people stay home grind virus becomes safe go work go shopping. 

Here's what's happened - people go work else lose homes can't buy food, thus making sure virus kills bunch people continues cripple economy. lover needles, approve!

Wait minute... **hate** needles! Trump imagine someone selling soul wealth/power devil would look like reality. matter says fucks up, continues everyone else would pulled wonder many think we're already past first wave. FUCK fucking mustard gas bayonets though People without insurance primary care physicians. ....two? Who's other? worried make tough choices current trajectory continues. thing make worse reopening actually rolling back sustainable solution. 10% people got covid developed antibodies rest 90% develop antibodies. prolly belong 90%. even keep testing covid antibodies, show negative result.

and since develop antibodies, susceptible getting covid again. please protect yourself. Distracting, inflammatory comment distracting inflammatory. must really hate law requiring employees wash hands taking shit, wiping asses, making food. handful guesses one. Stay safe there! Good luck preemptive congrats graduate degree. Yeah, that’s true. Bruhhhh say anything bad😂😂 positive best approach always “Son, bad news grandma. bank account ok.” Level panic /s anymore! able read it. clusters like NYC. bunch states infected, local leadership completely uninterested curbing. bad sort federal response. movie wouldn’t believe true. Voting along racial lines pandemic something might believed happened 1918. 

People 14th century Black Plague understood protection mask (even form bird suit) protective. I’m baffled. Surprising maybe? I'm PA we're still back office (90% working home, 10% office, maybe even less). 

When go back (still know when), required wear masks they're construction building allow even social distancing. They're bringing us back phases we'll know week ahead time we're going back. They're telling us week early get coronavirus test provided free office (outside course) we're allowed back work.

I've always loved job employer, amount thought effort put handling pandemic really makes proud part great company. Uh, city still started barely phasing opening first wave first week June (bars get open outdoor seating tomorrow), second wave people talking about? imagine losing father people insult tell repend different religion Masks help. Regions hard rules masks public seen 40-90% drop cases. 

Respirators theoretically help regular people more, absolutely saved medical staff, rare cases, vulnerable people.

I misunderstood saying, sorry dick. Tell protesters another article said symptoms two days later quarantined got tested. don’t disagree others going longer without symptoms spreading though. It’s talking myself. mostly get two downvotes little responses posts get deleted response level

The first level response serious Take us you. swear we're infected.  Spending time Canada doesn’t mean live lol keep forgetting Americans don’t even passport lol Nursing homes epicenter COVID-19. someone situation gotten disease home free. One person COVID-19 devastate entire nursing home. rural counties wanted end lockdown early.

Because like 3 cases goal flatten curve overload hospitals. point view, \~2,000 difference daily new cases damn good difference.  say groceries safe need wash/wipe. knows. hell 15 friends?! impressive.  What's 'we' stuff? lost popular vote. reason Trump's power archaic system. people dying disease want him. Actually, true vaccines development. still get - spread it! - prevents developing severe symptoms. That's fair. honestly know going go. Hopefully they're able get least sort season safely right track, said disinfectant, bleach. coming debate important facts right. Exaggeration deligitimizes claims. truth plenty stupid. Based mostly complete lack plan federal state governments.  People willing quarantine served purpose, eg flattening curve, letting hospitals prepare, letting research catch up.. never going stop virus late selfish beginning. expect people stay houses next several years vaccine may may come? Really, end game here? certainly leadership fact may vaccinate hard way.

All said can't bother least wear fucking mask wash hands POS.... blame people hiding homes. not, without good goal mind though avoid close quarters indoors. Looking statistical news sources hospitalizations rising states. Alabama, Texas etc guys enforce it? “main store” security checks walk affiliated gas station next store sign people ignore Read Facebook statuses. seems recovering without going hospital, good. many people Texas guns protection, wear mask?

I really wish could find twitter saw ago. basically went right this, people say need guns protect families wear masks, smoke, get health care, etc. seems guns fantasy reality. sure! I'll run first ones come across, think adequate I'll go back more. source advocating early lift quarantine agree with, points pan like Spanish flu on. decent source, depending much trust History.com admittedly dodgy. sources - pay attention Spanish flu learn it. said, understand viruses *much* better now. war also huge factor variety reasons, including spreading virus thoroughly allowing lethal mutation virus thrive beat mild strain (this recorded instance ever happening). 

The odds happening monitor spread COVID closely slim-to-none. Even though responses shite, new strain suddenly kills 10% people get catch everyone's attention quickly.

Given coronavirus flu, odds mutating mortality rate unheard of. Still, did, would better prepared. We’re fine! Everything fine! need worry. bad breath. ""2nd wave"" implies first 'wave' somewhat dealt with. Honestly think save energy costs. It’s I’m glad work (Menards), require masks worn workers customers store.

Edit: clarification. Unfortunately kinda choice ask wear it’s store policy. straight ignore bring items register check anyway What’s that? they're morons lol. Anyone half brain things regardless income bracket. motto pandemic. later get it, better. Next month, going discover better things too. public’s response virus telling response worsening climate change be. one hopeful /s sending kid school. I'm immune compromised I'm working home least January 2021. way I'm putting us risk fuckwads like Trump governor, Desantis, think good idea.

Edited word Periodically pandemics happen. life works.

It doesnt mean dont suck. even still, happen. people die.

Literally 150K people die *every day* worldwide. ~6 months covid around, that's 27 million people.

Each ALSO life, ALSO family grieving.

By comparison covid killed, ~450K worldwide. Less 2% deaths. 

Should ""not special"" 98% deaths casually ignored?

People die. sucks, always suck. people always die, that's life works. You, me, everyone reading post, everyone else die someday.

Sometimes, something happens people die expected. - - life works.

*Overreacting* death - exactly human reaction covid - smart course action

The fundamental problem entire situation virus itself, rather human reaction virus. extreme fear dying virus - worst case scenario predictions, kill 0.5% humans, 99.5% survive. 

But humanity's reaction virus, manner another problems cropping up. example, Putting 1.1 billion extreme poverty locked down, reasonable tradeoff million deaths might cause. Would think WFP UNs predictions less credible WHO’s figured Arizona would year round school school dates never connected farming like Midwest East Coast. TIL. I'd literally refuse service them. Solidarity &lt;3 single non-hormone drug world 100% response rate. always outliers. best vaccines 95% response rate. That's considered extremely good. skeptical claim like this. reversal show data suspicious. also remarked there's AIDS vaccine. much grasp anything. check, surprised real Bro, old fucks keep saying flu. Whenever anything goes wrong can't take responsibilty care can't swim heavy waters sing acid rain. problem! one boomer say shit me. Time step crap table, put money field, roll bones.

It never pays off. honestly can't tell joking hearing people say shit like seriously. scary part Brazilian stats low testing numbers vs infection rate combined massive numbers. feel like view everywhere (and correct) thank actual response actually brought real numbers statistics pile stupid lies. test virus like this. testing COVID-19 sucks larger false positive infection rate. 

The severity hoax, fell it, believe anything avoid feeling stupid fact. i;m disagreeing you, every corona study pointing X, seems another study pointing opposite X. believe them. Oh God. exactly right. Yeeeeehaaaaahhh. Jk. mean push early reopening.. Hold study instead press release. I'm always wary announce things via press release instead journal. still use services give US address reship Canada. Costs bit driving PO box, unusual times. Joining. leading. Wore mask, touch anyone, best observe six feet space around protesters. Participated movement bringing real change government, police, country views fights systemic racism.

She OUTSIDE.

How feel Trump filling building 24k people serve vanity feed ego? data lags behind couple weeks, that's end May. Let rephrase - go home get shine box. Well, seems people need learn hard way know accept ""No"" ""Don't"" anything insult human dignity. Yes, masks key along. administration knew shortage medical masks. let hospitals buy available masks, wanted convince everyone else buy them. So, *they lied*. 

Lots science, period hundred years, proved masks work protect people disease. Lots science, recently, proved sick person wear mask work protect people.  Masks work, every medical professional knows work. 

To stop virus, masks even good. important thing is, almost everyone wear them. thought 15 friends. lot people kill incurable health problems greatly impact quality life. people think death better, make choice whether anybody else likes not. Stating fact equivalent passing judgement everybody similar problems assuming kill worthless, individual deal situation. person replied seem missing last point. denial sad. denying progress nightmare. I've never doubt danger. know anyone it. whole situation really seem like hoax. hour ago former coworker mine really see virus big deal posted one children contacted virus. He's great guy pray things get better him. despite 45 says downplaying denial become pointless every person America personally affected covid-19  guys say alot. umbrella keeping us dry! therefore, need umbrella!

I keep long want, btw. fiance across border, America. seen since October article heartbreaking news. understand shit sucks. ""But America greatest app, tremendous app."" lady working Walmart complaining ""they give us choice whether want wear mask."" No, Wait, kept market open whole time?  mutation strain, mutations make different “strain.” read comments, rich people live here. come eat, shop, tourist stuff. people actually live poverty line.  40 percent 28 percent one unverified study. something isnt even title article promised. BTW listened Dr. Birx last month said playing tennis, sure handle people's balls!

My inner 12-year-old snortled. Canada share view. np, understand. 

also, happy cake day! isn’t surprising all, country filled extreme fad diets, treadmills covered clothes, retirement funds loans them. hard us sacrifice good future, even harder sacrifice good whole. Hell, can’t even agree killing basic human right. world burning, garden looks nice I’m staying away chaos much can. Well I’m irresponsible parasitic dick yeah sleep fine night. Beats crying acting though small piece cloth sooo inconvenient you’d rather kill people bear half hour. 

Yeah know don’t, could you? Bizarre proud people courtesy judging them, deadset small piece cloth might save time, money, lives. 

You’re obviously uneducated things work, pretending also ‘informed’? You’re selfish, you’ve already said don’t want personally affected this, won’t part make sure others aren’t affected either. last part unjustifiable, clearly shows you’re entitled selfish, KNOW it’s something people go through, still edgy go minor inconvenience actually help cause. 

Instead want sit around act like face mask sooo inconvenient you, seem actually think it’s matter ‘omg don’t like them’ that’s somehow understandable excusable. It’s not, you’re cunt. “It’s going disappear. One day, it’s like miracle, disappear.” Shit Really letting in.. fucking fly really need get there. least, forced quarantine remain observed 2 weeks they're allowed continue on. Like.. virus, matter they're headed infect bunch people along way? paper claimed strains widely debunked.

There known strains materially different other. would likely take months years identify one conclusively. might die, might stroke lose control half body. body wears masks. husband often people wearing one go (which super rare can't get something delivered) idea. result scarring believe so. it’s inflammation,it resolve time. Thank you! aren’t even considering I’m asking wear one, they’re ingrained mask = violation rights Yeah, see he's saying yes basketball baseball, I'd think baseball would safer. Tests versus hospitalizations? see article, skimmed it. testing? data seems contrived fear state charts showing deaths past several weeks; tests. talk. Freakin' moron. sad said.  really don’t get conspiracy crowd isn’t jumping chance wear mask. Think big government facial recognition avoiding wearing mask! Darwin wins Feces becomes airborne rather easily.  believe stems mainly fact mask wearing become political issue. Let's say got privy info man upstairs, second wave*


* Offer valid Nov 4th ...no specifics? Okay then. feel like mood around much pleasant considering found actual treatment huge results

I'm still staying ass home still lol bet cheap much longer. one close-talker friend bad breath even Bolsonaro’s smug expression. That’s argument locking again, opening up. 

Also, stop acting like Covid Devine punishment fun. That's disappointing part me. People can't bothered alter behavior activities short time (relative whole lives) LITERALLY save lives.  somehow, ""I'm sick lockdown!"" ""Masks unconstitutional!"" saving lives. gross. Well make heart grow used long periods time, one muscle want getting big. leads Decreased overall perfusion sometimes forms congestive heart failure exciting. cant eradicate disease becomes something normal, imagine dailing urgent care personal doctor, telling symptoms, prescribe you, get delivered. prepare ""Roma season "" buying shelf. cheap easy make. BIG NEWS. permanent? Um. never cared them. care *people infect*. hope meant this, since downvoted hell.[""So far, scientific data support Gupta’s best-case  Bet grand it’s due casinos reopening... meat legitimately.

As much may agree him, wish anyone death. recall hearing bed-bound period time? shit right? somehow thing NBA plan resume play Orlando ain't gonna last long. Mate, per capita there's number European countries waaaaay ahead guys. ""exceptionally"" bad call what's happening Belgium Sweden? even know numbers are? Seriously, get rid defeatist attitude.

Sure absolute numbers bigger population multiple times bigger country comparison bar Russia china. Russia bad USA let's even talk china.

Chin mate, listen propaganda country bad! bad, honestly, aint **that** bad. This- plan kill much us possible money them. Viruses care human emotions stupid shit Huh? course still around. H1N1 (the flu bug caused Spanish Flu, later renamed swine flu resurgence 2009). Herd immunity make virus go extinct! Yeah, let's lock another 2 months exponential weekly increases shits giggles USA! USA! USA!  Ahh yes, long there's enough ICU spots infected keep spreading? Mess Texas? Vic Berger recently episode Behind Bastards Jim Bakker, like vids def check podcast. Ya’ll keep coming Texas Florida, cuz leaders idiots. You’re trying skew another way. got herd immunity Spanish flu right? Without vaccine. 

You’re trying compare fast spreading respiratory virus bunch diseases aren’t really comparable besides viruses nice day :) fair, long term care facilities Canada also privately run like US US WW1 ensure victory? WW2? interesting. It’s sweet gets point minimal deaths, hospitalizations, cases, keeping things open letting people want, say true. ultimately, leaves lot stuff don’t know terms virus. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Interesting, CO2. intentionally, understanding right ? Genuinely curious. Ok start valuing unpaid labor everyone performing family suddenly ability provide 24/7 nursing care elderly family members? There’s good reason that. totally changed look. might seen even recognized nicer way saying diarrhea. Cuomo's press conference, zip code Brooklyn. place depends tourism, letting brand become ""the state wants get much Covid possible"" seem like great strategy. hate pizza man actually disgusting local area. Walmart's big corps made bank, small businesses shamed many bankrupt close down.

And one cares. wish luck, that’s plan! see many Americans post “escaping Canada” without concept entails law difficult be. wish luck, that’s plan! see many Americans post “escaping Canada” without concept entails law difficult be. problem guys, easter gone. episode 4 far. basically true movie 4 classes origin Mr. Wilford. First Episode enough make judgement it, least keep ep4. airing weekly BTW. think SF rentals housing crash.

I would think many people going stay 100% remote this, live elsewhere. Ah yes, shoving citizens metal boxes driven away correct way deal things. Seriously, don’t know American would give fuck Chinese think they’re every move/thought influenced insane amounts propaganda state pressure  really sad people criticise masks heard often don't. Public measures stay enforced without public consensus criticism enforced. 

Every time hear essential worker yell customer put mask go home want clap them. important stay vigilant around us covid scary interlude. wearing mask workout pretty dangerous? Amongst things like get smart believe. tend say people flagrantly incriminate themselves. Sooo we’re buying $DIS puts tendies believe referring number Americans died covid. pretty safe say need vaccines. Texas governor pretty much opened everything 75% (which basically 100%) tells us it’s fault, we’re own, closes eyes pretends it’s happening. told us enough hospital beds everyone (even beds hundreds miles away). state handling better least chance

All sounds little top it’s true. Sources:

Governor Abbot saying enough hospital beds state everyone: saying everybody responsible mask wearing, also mayors urging change stance: restaurants opening 75% : wearing Dallas become frowned upon. Social places open 75% easily packing people past normal 100% capacity. Bars packed people argue try mention that’s best idea now. I’m staying inside next months. lol right. Speaks volumes people hanging here. women aren’t allowed think independently men. politicization incredibly asymmetric though. one said cases happen... see smaller versions every time go store. Entire families going shop, bringing Grandpa Grandma along. Mask mask theres literally reason letting elderly family member exposed, along kids spouse, single one could picked everything store same. 

People bad assessing risk even worse telling loved ones ""no"". grandpa wants go Walmart get house dont push back rationalize ""well wont hurt go store"" headline something along lines ""Antibodies last least two months"" people took mean ""Antibodies last two months"". study going two months can't say anything future. I'm happy live New Jersey...... never thought would say Good job Aaaaand is. early plagues. 

Citation needed Downvotes logical... Yeah vaccine method way better, I’m calling Op saying herd immunity never happen, pretty unlikely live outside Austin I’m 21. Almost everyone know age hoping wouldn’t open back knew wasn’t yet. Almost older generation tired sitting around wanting open back up. yeah blame us Arizona literally refusing release full data nursing homes. Local news agencies fighting tooth nail pluck whatever info can. far they've able confirm 66% deaths state related nursing homes care facilities, potentially higher. Yes, TX, AZ, FL ""excluded equation,"" rest country declining fast. True they're keen things way even wrong way. play music loud too! Agree. almost nothing SE Oregon. mean there's cows, sage brush, weeds, dirt unincorporated areas. Yes please Much might like it, extremely political subject broad swathe population. think he's getting antibody treatment... Smaller California counties like Modoc county Placer county actively rebelling. hand forced pressure. Going data  9.24% yesterday 9.87% today. find whether smart landlord greedy landlord. Haha I’m talking viral respiratory diseases like various flu strains early plagues. mean, herd immunity achieved Spanish flu people getting it. Even diseases would get herd immunity certain places strike decades/centuries plodded along world

Covid behaving like regular respiratory virus instead behaving like Smallpox measles would pretty surprising. 

That said, vaccine method WAY better traditional method won’t work law require Oh, bad then. still poor New Zealand bother testing letting quarantine though  Can't find concrete info, okay see friends now? IDC bars going want friend 2 over, mask 6ft feet away course. journalists definitely covering overflowing ICUs Alabama major thorn Trump's paw deal stuff ? boss keeps making snide remarks saying stuff like ""you cant worried covid 19"" constantly since came back refuse go anywhere without mask Go check pneumonia without Covid stat let’s recount. think answer no, way air travel safely without cloth mask. Absolutely. What’s point charged responsibility ensuring resident safety governors don’t back? failure goes way top. non partisan issue well orchestrated coordinated shutdown national level clearly become partisan one due leadership believes fairy tales far believe science. People going protest police WORSE covid. sink already? one wants protest, endless brutality racism forced to.

And like whiners without masks (but guns) threatening violence muh haircut endless excuses piled far right, someone peacefully protests life-or-death crisis keeping distance mask suddenly virus 'light cold' 'fake news' yesterday worse ebola right wing howls protesters shot... Reopening going well! 1473 ICU 13815 hospital beds still available. Bad trend manageable now. People inside home = one getting bit mosquitos. mean, silly idea (people get malaria generally work white collar jobs home, lots savings). that's sort point. That's GOOD thing. Speaking which, Brazil hit 37,000+ new daily cases, that's ones they're aware of. Thanks! also stopped smoking cigarettes (4 months cold turkey strong) 2020 might shit show I’m working personal life it’s going alright used feel lucky born America. much anymore. They're accepting travelers? like, realizing cases?!? Wow thank sharing makes lot sense unfortunate makes sense hepatitis, herpes, HIV... I’m waiting happen area. Rents still going I’m trying find new place. recent CDC study Roosevelt gotten attention. 

This huge admit totally missed first time around. Thanks much bringing explaining implications. 

It'd fantastic submit report sub, along summary aspect! read though bit report last night admittedly patience right technical documents (it goes waves me!). *really* good summarizing / translating technical stuff plain language. think would helpful community! read articles like make feel better country's inept response? I'm curious that's obviously articles like written. Right, best information, majority people behaves.  


That's guess obviously, definitely fear 'open er ferget er' mentality lot less patriotic people seem have.

If small portion country recurring increased cost medical services country step high costs medicare whatnot let's say $10,000 increased costs per year 10% infected nebulizers, inhalers, increased lung infections, copd / mesothelioma, recurring clinical care including permanently disabled organ damage right would 218,000 people. Thats 2.1 billion increased cost per year \* average lifespan 'asymptomatic' 20s would what? 60 years. potentially right now, health issues last rest lifespan 10% US citizens confirmed positives would like what? 130 billion increased cost?

August/September hell Earth Florida. I'm trying vomit thinking it. people tend forget experts try reiterate patients hospital COVID. People still falling down, people still heart attacks, people still cancer, people still get car accidents, etc, etc. lock events reduced people less mobile isolated open back types situations increase people start become active. Add extra COVID patients opening back hospitals easily overrun. It’s Abbott. boss baby magnitudes smarter still blows mind necessary put ""/s"" that. 4,400 new cases reported yesterday! clicks articles reddit? Heck...its also view first wave over. LOL  true live (I'm Pasco county). feel like get weird looks I'm wearing mask. ""Yep. Numbers rose today. Like every day year. end sight. Tune tomorrow!"" Florida nuts right now.  what’s governor saying there’s way you’ll close again? Today’s number 278, includes 2nd half church outbreak. there's always someone threads like ""but numbers severely understated ! NY worst hit state US worse world ! 2nd wave , come back thank 2 weeks "" separate event I'm sure selection bias counts, think matters.  stop virus spreading people public, need people go public wear masks.  People stay home, participate risk pool. 

If go store see several people wearing masks, turn around walk out.  want store, all.  Whatever going buy ordered delivery, bought store. Cases going - populace really stupid increase social distancing without order governor? hard maintain little distance put mask grocery shopping, that's likely take reverse increasing trend.

Rather economy destroying orders, would far useful government could work determining infections occur clearly explaining mitigate risk. Here's upvote since got downvoted saying this. hope flatten it, too. One like 2 main characters didn’t get done dirty last season.. thinking minute ago ago- reputation Jaime got basically free killing king, Jon gets sent away brother, even though he’s rightful king?

I'm pretty sure California outbreaks related food workers there. Mostly undocumented immigrants. bet high-fived everybody Harvard expert office came zinger. north east washington state places could even considered past first wave. soon enough save economy. shit people still listen trump 

The scientists paper managed culture virus patient's poop. guy front locally counts customers, people working always seem happy see wearing mask. weird mix am, either people masks nod greeting, people without look funny. Toilet paper back shelves though, that's cool Official english translation available:

http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-06/17/c_80781.htm mean criminal alien? fully invested denying COVID problem. Masks implicit admission problem, can't wear them. often hear people say still first wave etc.

And country that's true. people stupid.


I live NYC, total shutdown made tremendous progress virus, first wave probably here.

But again, we're stupid fuck, doubt second wave coming. Alabama best covid info coming hospitalizations (hospitals required report probably reported) 56 high since April. tied human nature. tied news stations completely dropping coverage acting like Pandemic politicians exactly same. Alabama capacity issues UAB, Montgomery, Mobile. photo happening.... story actually building something really amazing heroic ran book content adapt sort forgot you. 

We'll squeeze character arc supposed last ten minutes show though. patient, Emperor Canada soon enough. people can’t handle truth. Protests wave 2 Hes trying appease muhfreedomcousinfuckers don’t think that’s necessarily true. COULD less dangerous, incubation period ~5 days average, contagious last 3 average, could dangerous contagious patient won’t get sick spread it.

Generally less contagious debilitates host sooner leading less chances spreading infection. Additionally, swipe packages/bottles/boxes disinfecting wipes. use wipes fruits/vegetables. may poison food. wash apples/tomatoes/everything hard texture soap water. berries use running water. told today sheep wearing mask Target- verbally wishing customers would. could really roll eyes Time buy fucking stocks boi. first half gonna lie I'm huge NBA fan unfortunately doubt model sustainable couple players, family staff start testing positive. much liability even union ends agreeing terms. I'm bummed, playoffs would've fire year. I'd venture guess allot meat traces it, considering amount people found infected plants around country fact pretty much cannot close. 

The real question get virus it, salmon suspect since prepared raw alot cases. doubling every 3 4 days back March April first hit states. coronavirus. ""Let's save us"" 

Well except protesting one approved protests. virus simply pass by. 

It's amazing see doublethink comes Covid protests. Umm. sarcastic?   weird, UK we've divisive years. Corona unified country, almost everyone wants beat careful. Yeah there's idiots small minority. Left right believe want stop virus. loooove RTJ! People common colds time year seasonal allergies still play. Best check healthcare provider. I'm worried returning work public school....ugh. people robots program fear stress. utopia. UPDATE: morning, Beijing residents must 7-day negative nucleic acid certificate travel Beijing Sure doesnt look like tbh. Exactly hate social media along widespread ignorance lack critical thinking resulted type article even needed. faith human race continues dying pandemic rages on... never wanted Pence, needed someone help pull religious zealots. thinks numbers cultists, need Pence for? He'd probably run Kushner VP thought could win ticket. Aaaaaand view would 100% correct. Sounds like BS let's say true arguments sake. many got sick enough seek medical attention? many false positives? bars opened week ago happened two week incubation period? pat back smarter everyone else. Let's face reality admit epidemic basically dud. 70 serious medical conditions definitely take precautions otherwise people want lives back. Well shall see.... 

All know china doesnt fuck around..they get 100 cases Beijing enforce strict hard quarantine/shutdown. know firsthand bad gets dont.  aimlessly destructive though. could made millions American flag masks distributed free, starting meme people posing masks slogan 'Protect Country' turned patriotic duty. defines afford? Chinese Koreans did.

And notably New Zealand. even full sports stadium 20 days without new cases. pisses Trump fucker always fails upwards going evil/criminal. know empirically must rare given Taiwan New Zealand also import ton food new cases pop nowhere. time, know theoretically possible. Coronavirus survive ice 3 months fomite transmission possible.

It's almost laughable people actually believe covid19 deadly Spanish flu. insane.  would say reading disability serious mental health issues based replies thread No, title could read, ""Some restaurants/bars closing voluntarily"" instead using title suggests state re-closing restaurants bars. Likewise, context, could give count estimate. 6 locations entire state hundreds opened time period?

RIP man, hope family sues bastards know history, preexisting conditions could somebody would almost guarantee they'll die this? understanding even high risk lock die it.

Also, think guy trying make point even get it, longer go without it, greater chance survival.  COVID-19 cases, Florida sets new one-day record

Just replace new number day still accurate headline week. Let's reset economy. universal basic income. something else balances everyone little more. ignore comment. Yes, makes sense whatsoever.

It also says patients ventilators, cut risk death 40% patients needing oxygen, cut risk death 25% 20%.  Right! they're ones working!

Holy shit makes sense angle.

I see sooooo many masks vents advertised reddit. way complain them? stay home sick prevent spread

you stupid. That's awesome news, matter spin it. illness seen hospitals 80% covid patients ventilation die? Hell yes, good news.

It’s worse. Arizona getting worse. Yeah man. I'm alachua, orange county currently. really political thing. Like, I've never seen anything like it. I'm wearing fucking face mask matter what. wore facemasks shit. Fuck regular flu, fuck spreading it. It’s corticosteroid...understandable given inflammation reports, concerning impact immune system. drugs heard ridiculously expensive actually R&amp;D funded taxpayers (for example, standard versions insulin epipens). drug companies spend money marketing drugs anything else.

They even spend money develop audacity overcharge degree I'm worried obvious double standards different communications come recent demonstrations vers. previous anti-lockdown demonstrations upcoming Trump rallies leave general distrust authorities, media, even medical profession comes medical reasonable. Leading increase conspiracy theories anti-vaccination communities. husband Hungary everyone gets BCG. virus also never took there. However think likely Russia still bad outbreak, I'm sure cause.

The people who'd get infected people who'd ""take risk"" go movie theater. /r/COVID19 *much* informative. come zeitgeist. 

But mean, really title *is* misleading. (the article references 6) restaurants/bars closed voluntarily since reopening. also since protests.

Coronavirus care social issues, laws economics, way life. 

There political agenda here, desire save lives.  know anyone die? dont. Pure hysteria. Liquor stores considered essential don’t alcoholics go withdrawal take hospital beds. like hydroxychloroquin, serious? HCQ unproven drug whole frenzy people threw support behind dear leader decided tout it. literally evidence backed (with full paper coming coming days/weeks) proven reduce death rate, quite large sample size might add. don’t think grasping significant 1/3 reduction ventilator, even 1/5 number patients straight oxygen, is. drug, vast majority patients ventilators died many cases. Now, large chunk patients able recover. I’m scientific scrutiny, it’s quite clear pessimist sake it. But, really, Canada’s safety too. might better, relaxed border restrictions let people hop across like old days would back spiking numbers right quick. graph article makes absolutely sense then.  'Not really. 20-30 percent huge'

In pandemic millions likely die, 20-30% absolutely massive. HUNDREDS THOUSANDS lives saved.

Where say cure? say go bar? Yes, guessed far left. exactly kind person referring to. two party system reality, damn fool reject reality. wish system different too, pretending exist stupid. FlU!!11! claim? got anything corona virus? got anything corona virus please take somewhere relevant. read study say this. summary

There's 119,000 Covid19 deaths less 6 months.



We need guns concealed carry permits protection ignore scientific medical advice wear simple masks use social distancing. /$ Without mask It’s summer months Still, risk risk. 

Think way.

Nobody wants risk, used weighing risks rewards.

Worldwide deaths motor vehicle accidents still leading deaths auto accidents worldwide year. Yet us, despite knowing risks, quite likely, knowing someone died vehicle accident personally, happy trade risk benefits get free movement. Even quite trivial pursuits like getting ice cream, risk willing take. Sure take precautions make sure isn’t dangerous needs be. follow traffic laws buckle maintain cars, don’t sacrifice driving. 

And thing. Every time drive, risk killing another person. mistakes could kill us could kill pedestrian another motorist. isn’t risk comfortable with, collectively, decided driving acceptable risk society due benefits incurs. Collectively, reason decided Covid, though, risk worth shutting for. that? Yes , contagious things “scarier” element mystery it, bit control, end, risk. aren’t really full control risk drive either. might kill someone else without meaning to. someone might kill us despite us everything right. thing. contagion matter? moves exponentially? Well point also goes exponentially. clear steady deaths long period time non contagious things acceptable ones come quickly go quickly? sure less acceptable really Would make feel better changed “workers” “ccp party members”?

Trump want smear makeup face don’t watch wrestling, there’s 4 wrestlers evening? support staff? Surely must dozens people involved. exam written test took local community college. Pretty much expect, fill bubble scantron type stuff. county website offers exam explains exactly test, sample tests knew expect.

In case data entry / clerical exam basic math, use tables (spreadsheets), alphabetization, etc. Pretty much testing could office work.

There also typing test taken weeks later determine typing speed wpm.

Once take exam put list results. Local employers get copies lists periodically, use fill positions needed. Usually state level jobs (if really good), municipalities (courts), schools, etc. Higher scores get calls imagine.

/s I'm concerned housing states.

If enough tech people abandon coasts take jobs remote...I feel like it'll wreck housing markets locals. city stop it. Remember politicians money. many many many years exorbitant price hikes rent stabilized apartments, rhe city council finally required landlords (aka hedge funds) raise rents either 1 2% opposed 8 75% one year 12% 2-year renewals.  Loll. I'm boat. I'll moving back east coast, cheaper, houses affordable. Sorry, cant afford million dollar ""fixer upper"" here. common sense flower doesn’t grow everyone’s garden. Go jail. Clinicians make life death treatment decisions based research need able trust it. used live remember scams well! :-) Mine went 75, 450 525, landlord tried talking us upgrading apartment extra room 175 month. Electric gas covered, yea, neither reach high, electric 120 summer worst days. Loss screened back door, apartment remodeled once, twice, due druggies.

Ignoring fact wife income, would little left saving buy home. Rent going faster pay raises.

Looking apartments, pricing much room.

I swear pricing still going up, oil boom came left. rent buy house. lucky get apartment 400 month, water cable covered, back 2014. thinking like year.

The surrounding area getting little nicer well. instance Shops Eastchase, seemed like still getting foothold first nice lot restaurants spring around them. mortgage 500 month miss zero? aware voter demographic. Almost 1000 new cases today. Looks like already 2nd wave me. Finally Good timing move fuck VA Colorado! feeling going happen case counts include antibody tests now. active cases rising

Source? make sense. Antibody tests tell it, tell actively positives count towards counts used generate headlines like ""Florida's Daily Coronavirus Cases Triple""

No, false positives would true original number. Like showed, numbers would actually look worse getting higher percentage also we're flat count cases nationwide. large number false positives able go 1% prevalence since mathematically possible.

That's true. That's false positives work testing done. First, random sample, second, tests multiple samples re-test. Two tests makes 2% 2% false positive rates. cases rising, percent positive cases rising (both daily seven day average), hospitalizations rising, ICU beds running hospitals operating surge capacity want know death rate rising? 

The short answer yet.

Now question you, would finally concerned does, assuming state good job counting is? Cause takes already atleast four weeks behind. 

I really sympathize healthcare workers right now. fucking drowning sounding alarm bells everything going people sitting saying concerned deaths gone yet. maybe they'll believe it. SC here, SSDD. nominated instead Biden 

Seems like low-hanging fruit. countries better job protecting vulnerable. UK, Canada, US similar problem.

They culled vulnerable. infection spread neglected care home refused medical attention going cause massive death.

You dont analyze pure numbers look deeper 



""The COVID-19 death risk people &lt;65 years old period fatalities epidemic equivalent death risk driving 13 101 miles per day 11 countries 6 states, higher (equivalent death risk driving 143-668 miles per day) 6 states UK. People &lt;65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted 0.7-2.6% COVID-19 deaths (data available France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, New York City). 

CONCLUSIONS: People &lt;65 years old small risks COVID-19 death even pandemic epicenters deaths people &lt;65 years without underlying predisposing conditions remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically protecting high-risk elderly individuals considered managing Good word Funny coming country won’t release real numbers give people basic freedoms. dick measuring contest US China getting old. seem well far level awareness, logic, reasoning.

Kudos dat indigenous villages connected modern, urban rural life. example, Mato Grosso, always clashing farmers area. Lots bloodshed. Futhermore, NGOs, police civils interacts them. like untainted hidden forest. can't say blame you. Occam's razor (because state epidemic) would actually say contracted it, experienced symptoms, still experiencing symptoms, vindicated accurate antibody screen. article also states continues test positive antigen. there's also that. growing body evidence Cov2 may extended quasi-chronic disease course. article cited may state states, like said, lack adequate testing means sentry mechanisms early spread virus nonexistent. particular instance, best deductively reason rely exclusively documentary evidence. pursuing herd immunity **they scared say loud**.

Tegnell even, pretty much, admitted early said ""a little cautious using word \[herd immunity\] since gives impression given case"".

He continues saying ""But idea \[of herd immunity\] becoming relevant see virus; that's need achieve. able control way."" Variations work slow spread trickle. Put mask every face would happened Yeah, everyone wants part fraction dies others may live.

So fucking selfish! entitled opinions, yes. Mine based growing body scientific literature, **fact** FI, DK stricter NPIs Sweden better outcomes. One thing stricter NPIs almost certainly drive home seriousness situation big effect behavior.  live market priced apartment expensive city. leverage. threatened move would someone new 30 minutes would go find place pay significantly more. really?

Luckily lockdowns never got point except NYC New Jersey. things opening back large segment population refusing wear mask social distancing, seeing large spikes cases number states. also healthcare systems starting reach capacity. wife's hospital started reconfirming staff properly fitted N95 masks PPE case starts get bad again. Hopefully happen definitely starting real concern hospitals around country. Cal. Restaurants, beaches, bars... Mostly open.

Imagine state lockdown months like Hubei civil war. biggest mistake testing heavily mid February enforcing quarantine time, numbers surely less 50k. ok, never know real numbers China it’s important us now. okay aspects, many people chronic diseases many severe obesity, also lot nursing care facilities, that’s cases deaths. can’t enforce another quarantine winter. Economically suffering like China, shutdown everything. get vaccine first whole world start praising us again. People still dying many parts world people can’t wait U.S open again, want move study right even pandemic.   Arizona really, really bad. Superimposing curve states really bad sooooo fucked. states locked down. Arizona completely open. 

I keep thinking hospital staff. awful them. I’ll go get Covid purpose brings tiger me.  Since seen real answer, post myself:

Aside fact I'm sure inner circle tested regularly, movements tracked closely - basic optics. wearing mask way try convey stoic leadership, voting base highly values that. well fact of, even know many fucking memes come still wearing mask? PR people well aware this. look fucking goofyass pics Biden mask. TERRIBLE optics. tries optics thing ""I'm badass, here's taking mask start monologue, like badass"" try play sides, ends looking like senile dipshit. 

TL;DR: optics. Well make first fucking wave first. put rest fiction covid 19 goes away warm weather now? Heavily armed babies automatically removed referred coronavirus-related subreddit quarantined reddit admins, stated may contain misinformation hoax content.

Your uninformed opinion terribly valuable here. People get tired explaining thing guys months end. simply comparing apples oranges here. Sweden remotely culturally, demographically density comparable Michigan. Michigan denisty 458.428 per sq km Sweden one **25** per sq km. apples oranges, denisty counts size. 

One glaring cultural differenc huge anti-lockdown protests happened Michigan. none Nordics. 

One reasonably compare Sweden near neighbors, esp. terms culture density. Norway slightly less dense Sweden around 15 per sq km, **20x** fewer deaths. No, it’s surstromming strawberries eat. Natural causes. Right? wondering myself. Truth told first vaccine available may indeed come China. already several working quite time, candidates countries also easily fail. true Chinese vaccines course. think people wait first, nothing bad comes couple months go get it, even China. 

For me, I'm happy one safe effective vaccine country next couple years. want think 2025 still vaccine... going different President come January, 2021, though. election 100% stolen.

We live representative government longer. remember trending video grocery karen.

If local Govt implemented Mask sooner, entitled people obliged wear one. absurd implemented months later pandemic. corresponds doubling number cases every 12 days. good, already approaching maximum hospital capacity. unlikely would happen covid die something else though. Odds least contributory factor

Not really consider hit nursing homes hospice homes badly. People literally go die. given month going deaths home. Covid breaks home, people going dying Covid, whether anything death.

And consider repeating homes around country, not-insignificant factor. thought worldwide view... always wear mask outside. Turns masks astronaut helmets, entirely impossible catch Covid going supermarket masks respecting social distancing, less probable. can’t believe removed post. saw part popped phone.

He seems like one true sports superstars hasn’t let fame ruin them. See also, Troy Polamalu. Pittsburgh blessed.  need clothes, boots motorcycle... keep f\*cking mask!  vote West Coast New England + NY become new country... states I'm missing? No, never. Chinese people, cancer patients chemo. I’d rather weird looks ventilator.  Thank service right, I've never seen t-shirt baseball hat print flag it. understand sentiment calling ""coronavirus waves"" semantics, misses point. Waves familiar concept many people describe coronavirus hits quite well. lot places, pattern was:
- original exponential growth
- Followed sharp decline (not fast exponential growth, still quite fast).

This pattern true US (e.g. NYC) true US whole. Basically, want apply wave description US, need split smaller geographic pieces (e.g. NYC). lot places first exponential growth squashed due social distancing.

The real question is: new first waves arise places little social distancing? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 please explain reasoning us all. Ok, I'll amend. Every time go store, store enforcing mandatory mask policies. I'm seeing anyone fighting masks Philly area. 1. Wear mask lead example 
Maybe already really everyone including needs reminder need to. 

2. close store make people wait outside go 1 1 wearing mask? maybe large signs ..? Masks decreasing NYC sure. like 95% people, I'd say closer 80%. Absolutely infuriating. people remember things like month half ago??? Ok, number heavily influenced much testing done, since testing much higher 2 months ago, tells us little. Tell us hospitalizations. Even so, time effort needed reduce bill well worth 100 company covered is. mention I'm sure rules government health insurance oversight boards allow lower RBC ratio insurers cover vaccine. Investment premiums pay health insurance companies make money tagged ""Good News"" comparing th Arizona dashboard state's, fucked. numbers comparitively adjusting population mid surge. deaths super low barely starting. locked down, masking. nothing stop getting worse worse. allowed take eat drink otherwise. selfless. positive us staying inside, use would 100% fine. No! need poutine fix! many people head sand regarding dangerous is.

This also true Spain even though one trusts government. Humans really seem stupid always, anywhere, regardless circumstances. Apparently depends get it. tests still takes days. Magpies (and corvids) pretty smart, though. live CA. First, apologize idiots probably helped spread COVID AZ. Second, AZ turn really bad hotspot CA needs close border states. user said exact thing except said specific member political party (it president obv) made general statement kidding ? Lol dont...? actually. paid attention history know second waves come almost complete removal virus people let guards creeps back starts without concerning explodes time worse Well that's reassuring. Thank pointing out; saved posting it. 100% projection/deflection Abbott's part; he's one ""the cure worse problem itself"" idiots. already lifting quarantine restrictions, many state agencies already back working office despite capability working home. pay fair market value time pay travel - none extravagant, deal. 

They don’t typically pay go conferences - common meeting conference already attending. 

They fund research studies. funding would research (time, materials, etc). Spending carefully documented justified. 

Not sure attractive reps anything. 

Anyway, strictly regulated. Pharmaceutical companies entire departments devoted making sure activities payments appropriate follow guidelines. !RemibdMe 1/1/2021 Protip respond messages.

Are USA? : WORSE FUCKNUGGET.

Welcome danger zone! It’s easy promise don’t yet I’m Oregon good! states started reopening see maybe 1/4 people wearing masks stores. seriously, matter? hasn’t right anything yet. Percentage positive tests going though. That's want see. Yes okay testing, great. still mean things getting worse. Masks sign fear weakness. wearing mask form kow-towing abject loyalty Trump, sign stupidity, ignorance science-denialism... Financially to, unfortunately. 

It's sad. try stay safe keep mask on. matter protests for? authorities, media medical profession honest ideological unbiased communication medical consequences public gatherings matter cause. Otherwise, they're going lose trust part population disagree ideology. really need public distrust, clearly issue handled people work together. like telling young people take pandemic seriously Tragically accurate That's home territory, really shame. I'm scared grandma. entire family keeping quarantined bringing groceries trump-flag-flying uncle go get take dinner. infuriating. Seriously what's point talking anyway flesh wound! conversation Trump 2 weeks now. Hubris helluva drug. ‘Scan phone’? need give name, address, basic health information (allergies), name primary care physician contact there’s problem vaccine batch, etc.... sign consent waiver etc.... least that’s every year flu vaccine.

All info somehow phone that’s going get scanned app doesn’t exist yet?

And ‘national database’? dude America. There’s national database anything except maybe people paying taxes something. Maybe even that. always hindsight people. get lax, think invincible point ""one time hurt"", end getting feel stupid af fact. 

Why always take stupid people get go something understand serious situation is? 

""Murphy's law, guess"". ""I think careless went public place have. wearing masks. think whole 'Out sight, mind' mentality. state opens back said everybody fine, took advantage that,"" 

Stupidity finest. Cheap steroid. treat pandemic disease affecting entire world. cheap long. Saw group 4 kids hop bus today mask, bus driver let em stay since single stop covered shirts. Good logic. Let us google every single thing rather asking question reddit. Ban questions.  Oh, Prime Minister crossed provincial borders go cottage Easter hours telling everyone must remain home. That's think people looking guidance? search pollster. poll somebody's Facebook whatever imagining here. pick someone participate. Three days ago went Texas health website see recommendations regarding covid-19 recommendations wearing face masks. link national advice referred-site recommendations using face masks recommendations Texas state site.

Incredibly heartless ignorant! Dallas mandatory mask rule wearing chin type protest. say like intended feature system Patient zero honest, thank blue party well. ask, ""But gonna get money?!?!"" supported Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign action donations (even got meet take pic!) yet... get Biden. 

Don't get wrong - someone like Trump, Biden looks like fucking cure cancer. mean... really? gotta go potentially? next Trump lot smarter less self-destructive. really hope blow running progressive candidate kicking road even (and btw, voted Hillary, I'm one 'protest vote' idiots) wonderful things mentioned.   happened California? tell, group people think masks used, people automatically oppose anything first group people say. second group people also staunchly anti-science, anti-education, refuses accept might experts given field know specific topic. Conversely, first group people pro-science, pro-education, believes experts.

I think specifically resistance act mask wearing much refusal admit someone else may correct.  think Trudeau trying find solution couples separated border.

They cross [spouse common-law 14 day quarantine rule followed. Unfortunately apply couples either those. finally leader somewhere balls say it. dunno guy approve message.   People pre-existing conditions appear 12 times likely die. Guess many Americans pre-existing condition?

You're utter nonsense. I’ve said I’ll say again: DeSantis idiot. Thanks. survived first recession back 2008. amazing customers.  ton ""will back open dining room "" lasted boycotting week. Folks beginning realize caution definitely right thing.

Please remember folks: Eating restaurant puts (customers) HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT.  meal worth getting sick. would go sit unmasked local medical clinic, go eat. Get curbside takeout.  Wear masks nose use sanitizer moment get car go inside place dine in. Report EVERY TIME see worker following state guidelines. Report every fucking time. 

We together. Ho boy ho boy. I'm happy live France. aunt pregnant cousin got tested positive coronavirus waiting week results careful hell/wear masks/etc. 


You bet ass coronavirus serious, I'm much pissed people say people wear masks sheep. Fucking decent thing respect others lives. 6ft wearing masks goddamn end world people. I'm... shocked say least. many people protesting risking covid police kill many fewer people? I’m guessing don’t answer since you’re saying don’t direct covid unit experience, given common wife say drug hospitals/surgeries wasn’t already used treat covid patients  Pretty sure answered question - White House feel bad you. Would love proud neighbors again. politicians tell us worry, clue. Idk read, theory I'm putting forward. talking loudly

Be sure get right face this, hear you. Personal liberty isn’t “dumb” it’s important human right.

Or maybe I’m grandma murdering Nazi, idk. think arguing definition word 'severe'.  surf everyday use sunblock. mean, got lose?  two weeks. day bars opened Wisconsin news interviewed nurse...at bar... guys plastic barriers like California?  girls 10000 square feet floor space divide 12x12 sections plastic barriers spray disinfectant every use. big ass pump prayers full there's hand washing station square.

Hard hit sauce wearing mask!  test Brazil US plenty active growing cases, silly. Thats public understand. old drug. patent it. real way price gouge this.

We hundreds vials theatres.

For non-medical: stuff like Panadol/Tylenol. cheap. everywhere. chance price gouged. likely become $1000/hit much normal saline is. Different woman.

POTUS robbing America front world Americans stand watch happen. telling doctors use March. know majority vs minority works   alarming, much potential start back due density there. far Trump concerned, done What's latest whether non-medical N95 protects user? I've heard mixture answers. ended taping exhalation vent like article says, mask effective protecting user curbing spread? I'm willing bet enough that, outbreaks pop up, people feel unsafe stay home. It'll never work. iPhone, Safari “reader view” makes *much* less atrocious. Americans really think would rub makeup off, that's legit wear it, therefore millions others follow example wear it. Maybe let walk outside there's smaller chance transmission son would heavily infected? playing social deduction game?

Good news! 5 friends woman 15 friends infected. Things improving!

Wait... case, would see spikes everywhere. NYC massive protests spikes. This. Ford (Ontario PM) come said “wear masks” he’s liberal... Curious see one plays out. estimates COVID19 IFR overlap Spanish flu - see mind current data accurate countries developed stronger healthcare systems.

I say - l said people dying older mean serious disease. I'm spinning anything, l'm presenting facts. let's continue ,,l,,(-_-),,l., ,,l,,(-_-),,l., worry guys pandemic trying stop! Everthing fine! ok. Wash hands lot. Wear mask fuck them. planning

Yet another entry ""Not Greatest Moments"" list.... Reuters? [China's COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows promise human trials, CNBG  Thanks answer. Take care! important foreign groups sign one, also depends who. then, important highly skeptical anything CCP's mouthpiece says mean Canada I’d keep closed longer, I’m American, please take Canada! like too.

As Christian love symbolism solemnity candlelight incense. like idea stringing lanterns designated public space name face people remembered, people go add lanterns, even though it’s sad numbers lanterns go light increases won’t forgotten. 

And pandemic city festivals stuff safe people gather lights Given today’s news public toilets essentially covid-misting stations , manage part drive experience safely? everything else great. domestic political consumption Canada. Quebec Ontario epidemics bad anywhere world. would rather hilarious, though, EU Canada freedom movement U.S. Canada. lmao getting news sports forum posts? idea would draw conclusion post. I’m actually feeling like I’m getting last laugh people go lots friends. may social life, I’m lot less likely Covid, too. disagree. try tell believe. COVID-19 moves slowly, institutions performed well expectations every level, thus, conclusion based facts come along... even slowly. economy may able wait - psyches may able wait. facts... come slowly. That's all. somehow doubt it.

She already gets shit loads death threats FUCK FLORIDA!!! r/preppers ftw. doubt cases going continue rise. rough ride going unstable reaction rise.

Juries still definitely looking like thing really dangerous. I'd relax. Better dead many friends parroting this.  maddening. Well, see, hospitalizations good metric. /s think user talking trusting anything state run China. 😏 knew bat, though. kinda obscure, one things learn exams bs save face. Nobody stop respiratory virus stay open business without masks social distancing.

If go bar restaurant, accepting fact may get coronavirus deal consequences. cannot stupid  took 3 years join war Um, source missed it, CCP state media lies, lot. Oxford least reputation truthful, Moderna Sinovac reputations lying

Not saying work, anything comes china's state-run media point treated utmost skepticism real question is: give gains well? study data living. Shit's fucked. ""pass blame,"" I'd say. 30 day extension doesnt ruffle moronic Trump feathers.

Canadians prefer keep close end year. Now, phase 3 efficacy trial, CNBG said will collaborate several foreign companies organizations run study abroad.

This moneyshot me, one thing politburo endorse vaccine, totally different ballgame disinterested third party also says works. deathly ill, covid rna snot? Even scarier - news / media react numbers.

Our interest waned - gotta get numbers back how.

(Although interest probably waned faster 24/7 fucking fear mongering, bullshit like.) fair careful possible takes one person careful infect you.

Couple many people dont seem care anymore yeah.. bummer. Someone else's negligence yours/your parents/your grandparents/ etc death. cases week ago? Shit. live Hawai'i we've really lucky, fear still ""first wave."" numbers seem pretty accurate serology data come out. Italy convict bunch geologists manslaughter earthquake?  Give money? fucking Virus can't bought paid off. *human reaction virus* (for example, lockdowns) cause that. virus won't. 

Dont blame virus humanity problem Maybe that’s clever thinking USA’ strategy opening far early: “We’re No.1! Can’t let Brazil take edge past, gotta get numbers back up” Sob? good treatment many diseases. doesnt mean shut country affect well being. many ways die, one them, albeit, low risk 60s. Lol cant contract ear holes. There's respiratory action fluid carry virus external ear body. virus cant crawl you. Baseball teams ton season weight lifting. Known pandemic fatigue. people (almost everyone sooner later) reach point personal benefit going back “normal” outweighs danger getting disease. one three ways pandemics “end,” culture instant gratification like US, makes sense would many would respond.

The two ways pandemics end cure found (fingers crossed) disease mutating oblivion/disappearing (like NZ). Serious question: difference mitigation containment? numbers look at, metric use looking numbers determine virus contained/mitigated? rode yesterday today! Going hell? Little hyperbolic no? Cases expected rise country reopened. 

Take break step outside, get fresh air. Oh virus could deadly Spanish flu, although virus kill young people large scale, thank God would hope they'd able get something us. 

The US would never allow importation vaccine China, half dozen US pharmaceutical companies coming want cheaper competition.

Nothing stopping buying ticket, getting jab, flying home way. imagine would big business airports express lanes people want get vaccine. virus goes butthole? matter. make sacrifices things safely minimize risk spread. modify behaviours protect conflicting messaging? go wear mask social distance. Seems pretty clear cut me. People listening caring mean anything wrong messaging. Well that’s problem virus: people severe risk. probably could avoid shutdowns save people dying call bullshit. MAYBE consider military among can’t afford it, that’s it. America. It’s sickening. Literally. I'm missing made-up ""facts"". I'll tell cousin died turned TV. Oh no. lost true American. God help family. don’t go let people go choose to. Either idea islamist is... racist AF. 


Who kidding probably lol. Serously would love come learn something new Nobody going take corticosteroid anaphylactic. long, anyway.

In end, way securely use Internet use all. Further, msy use big networks (fb, amzn, twitter) STILL would leave traces behind.

If invested keeping data secure, fine. so. scaremongering people believing crazy things (((the elites))) whatever dogwhistly thing come rather unfair. people ALREADY oversharing anyway profitted internet usage. plenty oversight people monitoring app updates usage, public interest making better anonymous possible. don’t understand aren’t getting data places now, 2 million cases US feels like data coming studies Wuhan 4 months ago...I’ve seen like two well cited antibody studies US (LA county NYC)...we need start compiling data people’s antibody tests areas get better idea many people infected dunno seems fair enough. Like said, idea long last, high schoolers get four years, it’s like it’s super viable wait out. Might well make safe possible.

Summer football practice started People acting like Florida wasnt one season evidence overwhelmingly shows effective. What's sceptical of? leading vaccine groups like Oxford, Moderna Sinovac done press releases data due speed working at. worries doomers - still 700,000 hospital beds available, 5,000,000 tanks oxygen, huge supply hydrochloronique barbecue sauce, don’t let minorities Mexicans take ICU beds. Come y’all! Alaska's case, 29 high, cases spread state. reopened well three weeks, cases fluctuated lot since high, getting 3, back today 12 think. important thing effective testing is, good contact tracing attempt isolate infected quash outbreaks. Alaska, positive percentage terms tests 1 percent, best state, feel pretty confident catching cases. Observing thing here.. Phoenix area.  wife can't believe stupid people are. TBH Italy managed ramp testing high levels lockdown brought lower peak - could perhaps caught many cases tested early on. ONE OTHER. healthy middle ground things safely. someone else pointed out, get together friends safe. ""slit wrists lonliness"" ""go bar packed strangers without mask"" TON ways socialize safely population climbs, value human life dimished? That’s still decent percentage people WOULD  Drive-in movie master race! words Nickelback: old shit different night Moreso realists turned news. 0.02% husband feel way too.

I'm sure Benadryl forever either though, need awake least hours day work!

Now big question is, calm immune response extended period, fix itself? hyped forever without drugs? Karen’s 20 somethings know one group people taking seriously. shirkers age older.  one regularly expects “just cold” mid June Arizona here.. Phoenix area.  general sentiment public since state ""reopened"" free-for-all. Memorial day unreal.  People running around acting like everything back normal.

What person describing realistic understanding electoral politics United States. hard win nomination major party without invested party long period time.

People get way invested *who* candidate spend nearly enough time stuff actually matters: platform. sense, candidates like Sanders Yang run failed campaigns. effectively pushed Democratic party left huge number issues. Joe Biden's campaign platform liberal Democratic Party ever adopted. 

Sanders Yang (and Warren, etc) huge effect Democratic Party, bunch people sad get vote special name November instead policies people advocate. person pushing policy important; policy is.

Probably additional amount unemployment. anyone experienced Portland Oregon Area? Definitely saw increases rent around suburbs here. making horrifically wrong assumption rate spread Texas similar NYC had. Texas rising 30% per week (per excess mortality, trusting numbers state). NYC shelter least 30% per day. Even worst case 30% goes contact tracing longer able keep up, Texas still considerably behind NYC.

But rest point good I'll repeat it: time act stop spread, it'll 2-4 weeks hospitalizations deaths stop rising exponentially. excess mortality numbers 30% weekly rate growth would COVID deaths exceeding deaths combined week July 4, window now. (By comparison NYC covid deaths 5-10x deaths, though short period). Cost housing goes 50% 5 years. Medium income goes 10%. Billionaires try colonize space. Migrations throughout history allowed people leave set somewhere else minimal cost. last ~150 years things changed significantly land either owned, already occupied, prohibitively expensive.

MUH FREEDOM!!!11! Careful. getting skewered posting part story. Someone already pulled ""wait 2 weeks card"". perfectly good argument. virus doesnt give shit feel, fact. necessarily crowd tightly packed screaming. choice.

As immunology PhD, fail understand anyone could make accurate predictions transmission little known virus molecular scale even aerosol scale. know truly susceptible yet. know susceptibility linked transmissability. even understand weather dependence yet even yet. confidence results outrageous scientific perspective.

I'm sorry believe field epidemiology least somewhat careful specifying limitations models. hand appear extremely inexperienced data analysis. we? people get even get sick? 99% dont die.. mean got dont know? bodys killed off? biggest increase 9.7%. rent increased 9.7%, would still even close similar $100 people mentioning here, did, would need hard evidence landlord actually improved property. still insanity, would call happened too.

To clear: definitely fact seasonality impact virus; fact many experts think big factor. [Mark Lipstich Harvard instance. said, Dr. Drosten said could *possibly* decrease [R value 

So *hoping* would saving grace. quite possibly false hope though, clear! know yet speculate still. 

Interestingly, seasonality general still poorly understood. really good general article that: hard predict COVID behave! I've contemplating topic myself. long rehabilitation times harm ICU, possible autoimmune triggers getting exposed totally new virus. talked ME/CFS one post awhile back gets triggered viruses microorganisms. article posted stuck especially. wonder happened people today? unusually difficult infection refuse heal, might possible Covid triggered another condition patients.

Yep, everyone employed precautionary principle. know disability burden be. 

Another problem ME/CFS result viral disease poorly understood generally. 

Yet another reason cautious SARS 1 survivors often nasty long term sequelae. There's quite bit literature paper describing ""Post SARS sickness syndrome"" quite striking: case, SARS messed cortisol production thought least partially responsible post-infection syndrome. 

This documentary imo even striking drives home point healthy young people lives know overall COVID often less severe SARS clinical manifestation, hope patients 'mild' COVID prone this. hope point! thread Eric Topol, one US' leading doctors, discusses fact three studies show even *asymptomatic* cases show changes lungs: means long term, anything, seen confirmed yet. think know. 

The massive amount unknowns re: disease really warrant precautionary principle. 

And happened people today, also wonder. hope well! may be. forget ""Gov \_\_\_\_ trusts good people \_\_\_\_ smart, blames increase {scapegoat group}"" Yes, right. Alzheimer's/Dementia patients incredibly difficult keep compliance different precautions. Wandering residents, especially, impossible contain one unit pose significant risk spreading infected. Unless locked unit, huge issue. appreciate respect nursing home direct care staff, especially, put go care residents. I've seen physically verbally beaten constantly put situations susceptible disease and/or injury.

Regarding PPE, getting better regards supply nursing homes, but, think hospitals still get priority. saying deserve it, think accurate portrayal difficult still appropriate amount PPE nursing facilities. definitely point used intended. example, procedural masks used 5+ days.

I guarantee opinion also changed clip &amp; coronavirus everyone basically already got it. stimulus. Economically, can't. 

States rely tax revenue run normal operations. federal government reliable back-up, facing existential crisis economic downturn (and lower tax receipts). Expect massive service cuts across board 2021, matter rest 2020 goes... 

We lockdown unless corpses streets. simple - amount charge goes overhead owning said house (AKA: profit) taking money could otherwise spent elsewhere instead sent you. add anything providing service, everything something average homeowner would need well terms paying maintenance major expenses - meaning net effect transfer profit tenant you. Sure, bet amount could say charge ""service fee"" covers administration costs, bet amount still less profit gained. drain repeated across entire economy, creating income wealth gap dictated ownership instead sort productivity. 

Its you, entire system whole. drain systemic, peanuts compared banks, large property management firms, institutions taking rental market two decades - still take part drain. Coming several unusually low days. give money people need it. right thing. dont need universal basic income. Universal basic income leads everything becomming expensive amount said universal basic income since people free money spend stuff. even rent rise Lol opposed UBI literally months ago, don’t turn blind eye  guess 119k dead people it, died play politics, super committed.

And unraveled it, scary boogey man's ultimate goal, evil plan, get people wear masks.

Filled political crisis actors less. 

It's crying wolf there's fucking wolf there. report says ICUs full, ICUs full. New York densely populated one, said mostly state. say cases people isolating, many questions. live aparatments? get food, laundry? visitors? rentals homes skyrocketed area ): fuck is. They’re asking another $100 per month again, 4 years row now. Dang got lease renewal landlord want increase rent $35. get increase rent lack government contact tracing combining lack transparency businesses due greed. going get bad people stand lives, again. Oooh look me, want police stop killing family friends 

Snowflake. Nothing article says anything miners travelling anyware Gällivare. mean fear panic realistic assessment situation. I’m worried getting car accident driving work hour higway. Covid quarantine actually decreased odds zero.

Pretty sure covid feb. sick week, weirdly sick. Super high fever, coughing etc. Yeah shit.

Real tired dipshits Arizona (where live) talking second wave coming.

We expected peak June anyway, first wave BARELY BEGINNING.

And already ICUs asking nurses buy PPE (for HUNDREDS dollars per month).

Fuck governor, fuck hospital system.

We need serious reform working conditions healthcare workers.

The janitorial staff worse anyone else. Highest risk exposure, almost ZERO PPE, long hours, hazard pay (in fact earn less unemployment right now).

Meanwhile, hospital admins (most longer even set foot hospitals) taking MILLIONS home.

And leads lack proper patient care, even patient death.

And since hospital allow visitors, guess what? Covering malpractice easier ever before. Guess else? malpractice almost certainly fault hospital workers. fault hospital.

For example, refuse buy certain equipment, nurse's response time much slower react coding patient. right response time crucial nurse needs fully gown entering patient room.

Add fact hospitals REFUSE hire nursing staff, patient:nurse ratios skyrocketing.

Your family safe hospital right now, people blame hospital admins (and perhaps state governments encouraging people go bars/clubs &amp; wear masks) think case. might distinction antibody tests tests. maybe Florida fudging numbers. fixed getting called out. actually pretty good job publishing whole lot data, even data suspect. 

You see data today here: http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/action/report_archive/state/state_reports_20200617.pdf

It lists 1,486,759 total people tested. scroll ""testing laboratory"" second (Page 40) see 17th, conducted 1,752,714 total tests, 110,650 positive. extra 265,955 tests performed counted ""total people"" number, presumably person tested multiple times. Canada quite strict border control immigration policies. Oh know it. I'm saying less dumbass would do. see NBA, college football NFL going season year either.

Imagine 32 players/coaches/staff coming covid middle season NFL CFB. whole entire team quarantined end season them! AVERAGE incubation period 5 days

Yes, take 14 days less common

Some also symptoms earlier 5 days Lol 2 year old stress level low? :) really think people hoarded masks? migrant farm worker blame used. I’d expect become talking point too. Sucks him. Something something stupid prizes. People definitely finding reality IDGAF moments... say people hoarding toilet paper? I’m angry selfish Americans sneaking claiming going Alaska hitting tourist spots instead Trump administration refusing tell taxpayers got 500 billion small business loans? 500 billion money paid government.  assure small businesses got loans left twist wind.  GOP Trump sold us country highest bidder cashing comes crumbling down. idea, maybe medical professionals food service workers stop wearing masks gloves tell people choice don’t feel like wearing them. It’s hard. people refuse wear masks complaining medical personnel food service people wearing mask gloves them. No. overestimating speed virus. Many people don’t present hospital 14 days. don’t feel like explaining seems like lot young people misconception.

Three weeks superspreading event cases spike.

Four weeks deaths spike. thing wrong country people got mad Michelle Obama saying Americans drink water. looking logic reason, find here. Look exposed mouth nose! I’m chicago 90%+ people wear masks. Completely different rural areas Though metabolized cytochrome 2D6 (CYP2D6), CQ toxicity may enhanced escitalopram, CYP2D6 inhibitor.

This important detail! criminal everyone food prep wearing mask. well everyone works register. lot people everyone dies something.

we ~47,000 people kill year. Accidents kill nearly 170,000. ton people.

Even face though, 117,000 (current number post), pretty staggering. places #7 cause death based 2017 data, soon #6 passes alzheimer's.

Covid killed nearly 3/4 many accidents combined normally do..... june......and really kicked hard march. Yes even then, that’s misleading. population back 1/3 now. really comparable, first 6 months covid would need kill 225k people.

And further, that’s 75k, WITHOUT travel culture. cross country, international flights.

That’s 75k dead traveling primitive cars horse buggy. think that’s voting system favor echo chambers. people post /r/politics won’t fly /r/conservative vice versa. Irl isn’t really voting system, companies aren’t really enforcing mask rule. really true? variety ways pharma companies reward Drs like? Invitations conferences? Speaking engagements? Consulting gigs? Funding research studies? coincidence many pharma reps attractive women? whole damn world really. don’t know anywhere else control. Look Europeans they’ve reopened. Everyone taking seriously. get wave 2 strict lockdown guidelines, oh man, I'm worried us. sedated awake catheter heart. Went neck. Nasal swab better knock out. get it, feel many Australians residents family overseas - put mandatory 2 week quarantine plus 2 week self isolation plus test whatever, make somehow possible. protests started 3 weeks 2 days ago

Average incubation period 5 days exposure News aired salon/barbershop requires mask service actually customers exposed employee accident COVID-19 one caught due mask requirement. Listen boy 

Someday older

You could get hit boulder 

While lying 

Screaming “ come help please!! “

The seagulls poke knees Delete repost, altered titles allowed. really wearing masks Ireland absolutely socially distance 8 new cases yesterday Every smallish outbreak Korea last 3 weeks centered around indoor spaces without lot airflow. can't get anything else, least get many doors windows open can. mean, Fauci tells public eating lemons give immunity covid19 people believe that; that's really Fauci's fault. means people either stupid, gullible, both. Well, course, way early panic second wave.

Don't think might time start taking first wave seriously, though? raging country. saying. Oh Karen.. Government lying.. nooooo would like effective treatment vaccine (correct I’m wrong). Yep, sure obsession sub Things like : proud city right now. 

/s thats clear ...because Whitehouse pompous, ignorant fools believe immune virus Trump “holy”. 
Leaders lead example. virus contagious (yes Trump it’s proven), STOP CHAIN TRANSMISSION!!!!  tried transparency, kinda, Fauci always briefings. working president they're going way, make people forget it, it'll go away. Smh. lot people said would transmission. Many people attend think covid isn’t serious problem (the ones without masks) enough time passed protest infections show statistics. fact would right begin see first hospitalized rolling event. Everything far week Memorial Day, protests. announced compassion leave suspended fuck up. people wont able get vaccine whenever first comes out, saved people highest chance dying virus, spreading it.

So like doctors, nurses, healthcare worker, people nursing homes, old people.

Then go students, teachers, professors, high spreaders. also go everyone else high risk death.

Lastly go everyone else. Sadly something like 60% early clinical trials arm study includes drug view would correct  first rule medicine: HARM

The doctors work CDC, enormous amount harm telling people wear masks.  suspect 100,000 people (so far) died specific lie. Doesn’t home gym? possible said meaning arent sure. pretty rare well today. high BP headache. get got 3 months bout virus.  Dunning-Kruger Effect next day, several days later might infectious. weren’t already wearing masks?? long get new pair Nike's free 70"" TV 600 sq ft apartment, care may insight...

When Trump visited Ford plant, wore mask entire tour. asked warned media showed up. time came took mask off.

Someone asked didn’t want masked camera. said didn’t want appear weak. fair, would difference Microsoft Huawei chip first place

heh I've seen Germany cardio long pandemic. assume simulate high altitude. ... Maybe think told bother wear while....

That's thing trust. damage it, quite hard get back. know that. Reasonable people known Trump would fail act since February. put another way, .8% America dies every year roughly. .1% 12% normal yearly deaths. would make #3 cause deaths point. Cancer heart disease (#2 #1 causes respectively) common, make many deaths every source combined, half total deaths. Crisp said friends careful social distancing stayed indoors months “doing everything right first night go out, Murphy’s Law, guess,” Crisp said. “The thing common one night one Crisp said regrets going celebrate months quarantining. sunburn effect fun. Grudgingly accept well. hate him, think they've done amazing job overall, better NZ even. give credit due. might also like fear germs bit, sub 7100+ cases today, post age well... city from? hear south bad, north deep deep sh*t basis assumption? Oh damn take upvote Nobody said would ZERO cases spread protests. 

But think we’re pleasantly shocked significant spike Trump thinks masks make us look weak. never going go trump doesn’t cult won’t either really is. vote new politicians. hate always last everything important first worst areas (like this). Great riots Somehow, end evil Democratic plan trick killing election. fact people think masks help though...  Re-reopen Amercia, close work, reopen, close again... 

What economy needs infection control long term federal planning. needs whiplash! think america decided paying way many pensions. 10-20% population gone. wont succeed. quarantine forced may paranoia I'm starting governor trying kill us. knowledge, let's hope stays way :)

I know also suffer comparatively fewer flu deaths (the UK) year US despite significantly lower vaccination rate, might well gets vaccinated country - vaccination rate catching flu could prove serious thankfully high here. smart. Tourism big industry protect citizens. Well. Eventually people following dumbass supporters. tried whiny strongman properly explained danger would complied. Phoenix students Trump. Probably knows retirement age base may dead hospital ventilators election time. Thank you. fucking titles man. They’re ALWAYS things could follow ‘but it’s bad might think.’ would never write that. I've saying 600k end year since March.

Please prove wrong wear masks animals. states there, yes, part, no. Many states opened without safety measures response ceased public health trying get economy back up.  Hi, fellow South Carolinian. still don’t know anyone personally infected right now, think it’s I’m isolating family well, hardly know anyone anymore! major surgery next week cannot pushed back anymore, covid test pre-op appointment tomorrow...I’m nervous we’ve somehow picked don’t realize it! I’m near Greenville, cases control, getting really scary again. Well... wrong?

Pandemic people going business like normal, ""you can't tell do' attitude, states left fight PPE, central coordination... Yeah totally see that.

In UK know control, Americans self aware? boss Michael Scott? really bad. Like really really bad. 

If Airzona population PA, new cases per day would 4206, 2x PA's actually peak.  I’ll phone trump word means sane characterize everyone virtue signaling? ok...     
i really believe perhaps ex-boyfriend grew person feels responsible. course. Nobody said, “Hey, imma use free catch us covid!” sure that’s relevant discussion. 

The state allowed bars fully reopen. Leadership owns sizable portion responsibility properly honestly inform public. 

The misinformation confusing messaging REAL VALID problem. 

I mean, informed consent thing, too. boy... virus didn’t even start Wetmarket, truth China never control, still lot people Virus CCP trying shift narrative. CCP never fault, it’s always people foreign interference describing demand.

When 10 people vying single apartment, whoever pays likely get apartment, aside couple factors.

Want teacher able find place live? Build more. teacher never able live 10,000sq ft mansion, build enough, they'll able afford place live.

That actually pay teachers they're worth, that's another story. think really important differentiate dealing virus dealing active pandemic, thing. 

We likely fully eradicate COVID next years, assuming ever via vaccines, treatments, herd immunity places, etc. 

That said, come around much believe countries active pandemic within year. 

For one thing, almost certain least one vaccine market within next 6-8 months. even though available everyone, everyone get will, get health-care workers higher risk immunized, would go long way towards seeing us this. 

For another, finding effective treatment easily given orally beginning show signs would also mean end pandemic, believe they're close too. Popping r/COVID19 sub given day shows reports countless trials treatment combos tried. 

Lastly, also know virus - transmits (primarily inside via close extended personal contact), greater risk, better ideas treat hospitalized. We've gotten years worth medical research done span \~6 months. That's amazing. 

So think COVID virus going anywhere anytime soon, think active pandemic going mostly behind us time next year. relevant hypothetical comparison person drawing countries. makes looks like US 4th category getting hit hard, starting recover, getting hit hard again, state really falls category beyond maybe Florida.

Florida's median age cases plunged 65 37, daily deaths trending months, outside nursing homes, nobody dying. fewer ICU patients two months ago 3.5% hospital beds occupied COVID patients. beds available March. sure I'd consider ""getting hit hard"" Another reason rents increase yearly: property taxes properties go every year regardless economic recessions etc., turn raises expenses property owner. countries shutdown. Even mask wearing ones.

Stop ignorant first time I've seen Ivey's name ""bar"" sentence. virus regard people find distasteful. neighbor's rent dropped 17% got free month boot. ""luxury"" building San Diego ton recent vacancies. We're close white collar tech/hospital/university jobs continue employ tenants, I'm guessing proximity draw used WFH policies lighter traffic. 

My renewal notice come day now, curious see looks like. NYC one populated densely packed cities US.

I think idea bad could NY. experienced severe illness believe COVID-19 (he usually gets hit hard respiratory infections worst one he’s years, says). would expect based severity illness significant level antibodies tests indeed true positives.

I told ask doctor safe. Easy, call events companies contracts lmao realize 54,000 dying plus number covid death per week therefore making weekly death rate higher normally is. 

It seems care American lives. That's ok lot people feel way, grandparents, friends immune disorders, even die alone hospital bed without loved ones around. There’s nothing law says implement hard lock legally. things used. all. initial response indicates nursing homes ones causing mass death infection. point due nursing homes poorly run anything particular wrong. However, lot cases, due overall easing precautions society taking prevent spread. know, comparing two apples oranges. false dichotomy. go bar cost anyone life, done. Asymptomatic spread extremely rare. Presymptomatic spread common. week since I've gone bar symptoms, spread anyone then.

But let's pretend spread Coronavirus someone bar. voluntarily bar along knowing full well risks involved. feel bad expect feel bad me. go expose vulnerable individual like Grandma somewhere else, fault.

So person possibly uncourteous bar bartenders attendence partially voluntary. Randomized Control Trial study verified outcome shows benefit health care workers community members households wearing mask respirator. 

***There study. exceptions.***

There many randomized controlled trials meta-analyses RCTs, designed detect benefit wearing mask, terms reducing risk infected viral respiratory disease.

In many studies, known bias self-reporting eliminated using laboratory-confirmed infection detection, statistically meaningful advantage ever found, either health-care community settings, either surgical masks N95 respirators. 

No study, many, able establish advantage wearing mask respirator, viral respiratory diseases.

Likewise, unbiased RCT ever shown advantage confirmed-infected person less likely transmit viral-respiratory-disease infection susceptible (i.e., immune) persons infected person wears mask.

This means that, ***even controlled professional health-care settings, benefit small detected science.***

Therefore, debate virtue responsibility wearing mask reduce risk infection, occurring science vacuum. political, emotional psychological debate, one science-based.

In terms lockdowns saving lives, argument based purely hypothetical notion without lockdowns, mortality rates would much higher. nothing concrete back assumption up.

On flip side, look countries strictest lockdowns - Italy, France, Spain &amp; UK - also highest mortality rates per capita. could argue cases lockdowns actually made problem worse.

There's also evidence suggest initial panic caused Italy &amp; Spain, contributed hospitals many areas overrun, pandemonium also led many nursing homes short staffed even abandoned Eastern European staff fled back homelands ban international travel imposed.

But nothing concrete back assumption either - we're still dealing hypotheticals.

The applies whole Sweden vs. rest Scandanavia debate.

At minute, ony thing take that, terms reducing mortality rates, lockdowns might worked, might have, - depending viewpoint - Swedish strategy either qualified success out-and-out disaster.

Looking Europe whole - C-19 situation - everywhere - number deaths peaked April delcining steadily since then.

Other difference mortality rates, discernible difference pattern applies countries, regardless measures put place.

That would suggest important look effectiveness measure, important look countries higher mortality rates common.

In top rated countries, one common denominator nursing homes abject failure case provide increased levels protection them. I'm sure that's factor, consider 60% deaths occured nursing homes countries, certainly points major factor.

And look effects lockdown measures - cases, see quite clearly measures caused deaths Covid. 

 Taking UK point example - significant number excess deaths since March attributed C-19. reason many deaths - National Health Service effectively shut - people critically ill unable unwilling acess medical services. pretty much non-Covid related procedures cancelled, deaths attributed people unable access treatments vital services like cancer diabetes.

Have look charts \- show amount people UK died home since lockdown unable access vital medical services stopped due C-19.

There additional [10,000 dementia April alone England Wales, caused lockdowns - figures include rest UK (Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland).

Already, people died UK knock-on effects lockdown measures actually died C-19.

It's easy state black white blanket statements like 'masks lockdowns save lives' - people tend disagree - look greater detail, reality simple. state federal government willfully murdered old people? mine go fifth year row then?? ""*Speaking Tuesday Tallahassee, DeSantis said plans reverse reopening state recent uptick Covid-19 numbers, ...*

*“We’re shutting down,” said. “We’re going go forward.”*"" Probally would never able lock national manner, probally many people decided listen. I'm unreasonably angry ~800% increase medoan housing price last 40 years. Yep, people either:

1. lived SF entire lives continue live (many families property SF hand generations)
2. Live 478 roommates
3. Commute surrounding areas, even gotten astronomically high. 

People keep getting pushed away tech hub. grew would like able stay can’t afford unless they’re making really really good money. 

Too many fraternity-turned-tech-bros US moved work Twitter Facebook Instagram pushed locals, artists, music scene, overall fun culture San Francisco. I’m bitter 🙃 5gs rent? Fuck rich noise. understand. renewed rental contract never rent gone up. understand inflation asked question. People saying $50 once! Utter insanity. Anecdotal family friend continued test positive two months diagnosis. needs EKG performed, hospital goes won’t see stops testing positive it. either wait find another hospital willing it. happened Shanghai, lot expats able return, leaving (end contract/redundancy) one yet allowed replace them.

But worry everyone, they're going back again....

And anyone looking in-depth financial analysis rent prices Shanghai, tell you, ""fucking ridiculous"". Absolutely right. I'm lucky second person help this. wife whole elaborate glove routine rotation schedule. wipe gloves antibacterial wipes (and everything touched - mostly car) taking off.

Is perfect? certain not! I'll take assist percent chance contracting thing, matter imperfect. specific NY, sure stats rest nation.

We need improve Medicaid elderly care - currently, Medicaid covers average 70-80% costs caring residents facilities, 60% facility residents paid Medicare. means nursing home facilities operate either loss razor thin profit margin (-0.3% average). 

Between this, care providers severely underpaid, nursing homes *struggling*.

That said, biggest factor nursing home transmission NY racial makeup. Residents tend placed facilities within communities, community segregation still alive well, predominantly Black facilities hit hardest virus. facility’s history quality care, Nursing Home Compare ratings, non-profit for-profit ownership structure, proportion Medicaid residents bearing likelihood COVID-19 infections, hardest hit NYC facilities zero deficiencies following multiple Department Health inspections. Put simply - absolutely everything book, virus still get facility, residents experienced socio-economic weathering predominant Black communities, they're far likely die.

So, need funding residents care, society need improve overall health minority communities. Pretty much.

The Coronavirus days great piling money.

Does suck ""the economy""? Probably, personal level, great. People complain lack certainty middle response doctors there's valid points made.

But number would almost exactly experts like Fauci Osterholm predicted March..... think you’re referring Bernie Bro’s lmao talking nearly 40% difference calculation 0.82 thing comparing (1.1). close. great example problem happen Austin. We’ve downtown residential building boom ten years now—pretty much 75% new skyscrapers primarily residential. sold city council developers “high end development downtown ease housing prices elsewhere”. 

Flash forward years, tech companies like Bumble get busted running businesses residential towers it’s cheaper paying commercial premium office space. 

It’s also abundantly clear many, many record labels outright lot downtown residential property 1: makes easier arranging hotels artists high traffic times like ACL/SXSW, 2: property values Austin absurdly skyrocketing it’s actually high ROI company. I’m NYC, lots people negotiated 4 months free rent, 25% rent, etc. landlord however budge, hoping something help considering many us jobless right now. always wonder though. cousin paid 1100 month 2 bedroom outside Austin. made 30k year (teacher). I’m queens NYC, paying 1600 small 1 bedroom less experience made 40k. balance out? really struggling decision right now. far behind rent Los Angeles know make honestly even tho going give us extended timeframe pay back. thinking need live right UCLA son even going campus another 6 months 85% classes online. wonder start expensive areas. Sorry vent weighing heavily. Plus moving pandemic seems crazy Lol. people made right choice 2016. 2000. Much good fucking since matter one iota. US system gets voice rich heard. Let's pretend otherwise win millions votes still loss. would try negotiate already signed papers. Landlords try pretend market call might get discount. Oh sheeer Finland: masks uncommon, &lt;5% pretty much everywhere. 1st wave practically over, daily diagnoses single digits, weekly deaths too. Restaurants reopened limitations June 1st. non-shitty apartment complexes Dallas, let rent unless monthly income 2.5 3x rent. wanted rent place $1500 month, would need gross $4500 monthly. really matter. 

People care even notice Employers meat industry Germany obliged give employees PPE order maintain high hygene standard since 2017, doubt lacking PPE. big problem workers foreign workers housed small quarters high density people per room usually shuttle bus service workplace. infections probably even happen inside meat plant. Imagine live HCOL area. live two reasons: job convenience amenities. jobs currently remote amenities either open safe use. know quite people relocating places like LA, SF, NYC back home temporarily. What's point extending lease live tiny footprint without ability take advantage reasons actually want there. optimism allowed here. They're gonna die come back zombies. Historically, got married 16-20 moved groom's parents; got house farmland father died became incapable; like could go claim land everything already farmed someone else - well, eras could crossing ocean could afford risking luck colonies, rare exception rather norm. Solution. Maybe public get ""rid"" themselves. 

If politicians local officials listen guess people something themselves. 

As reckless sounds proven solve issues. 
The riots/protests proven that. Ah mean guy used ""troll"" army spam reddit non stop. basically the_donald. Fuck politics reddit. Take shit elsewhere. forums, make own. free. dont listen bullshit advertising here. That’s Florida, always positive. provide source 110k deaths? important take total deaths account. is, I'm afraid 54k deaths per week (nominal) compared number showing deaths confirmed COVID-19. 

The CDC actually pretty handy [table shows measured death rates week view See orange line? measures threshold ""excess deaths"". Generally blue bars indicates following regular pattern death rate suggested, 54k/week far normal. 

However, weeks starting end March til now, bars orange, indicating exceeding number deaths per week much 39%. yes, context important knowing interpret data accurately important! Fair point. Swedish numbers include excess deaths? Dr Fauci useless like took wife Melting Pot Saturday anniversary. restaurant established social distancing, every second booth closed. wait staff professional wore masks. date late, customers there. nice time, feel anxiety whole thing.

So, opinion: depends restaurant, comfort level, level professionalism place. like everything else released 100% confirmation anything. says might things look promising need data.

You keep posting link I’ll keep posting response What's crazy worse position. lockdowns table, simple stuff like wearing mask maintaining appropriate social distance become politicized. 

To point ask someone step away mask risk coughed berated. Weirdly enough, one landlord time. heard friends seeing major increases, either, could feature rental market here. Prices generally quite low large city is. condos exactly market rate. Faux granite cheap stainless luxury make.  magical number need hit people start taking seriously, wearing masks they're out, avoiding unnecessarily? people time people protest get involved politics. 40 hour work week deliberately designed wear make impossible fight change.

Alzheimer's they're going quarantine/there's way keep rooms away others. Combative residents also pose problem spreading staff. Residents alone, scared, isolated. There's lot variables.

Also hospitals seem PPE availability. Yeah, thats accident. companies teams dedicated squeezing every penny you.

My apartment raised 4% 3.3%. pretty pissed saw complex competitors offering first month (sometimes 1.5 months) free level rent started at. market may competitive though.

I ended buying house instead. payment literally cost 1 years rent saved getting 0 interest credit card (for 15 months) paying rent it. plan staying area good way go. Build equity!

Even tiny payment, town homes good condition 3x size apartment lower monthly payment. companies scum i'm pretty sure they'll find way let chinese university students people say housing costs much, hard add ""well, yeah, everyone wants live does.""

I've got family rural US. get it, less jobs less culture diversity many people want live there. housing prices reflect that. (My grandpa recent passed home - 2 bed, 2 bath big lot, built 80s, issues whatsoever - sold whopping $85,000.

America huge lot land cheap. issue everyone wants live small pockets (cities coast, primarily). Corporate extraction. Private equity Many Americans vehemently wearing seat belts so... Despite hoops people sub trying jump through.

The simple truth Covid infectious deadly doom mongers like believe. already happening. things open... noticed lack traffic? China even pandemic control, huge number cases Beijing Shanghai even know say it’s few. see spikes protest another week two numbers seeing today directly linked reopenings  pay rent get evicted. nothing rent price. Switzerland, they're pretty strict renting outside 1/4-1/3 monthly income window helps keep rent stable. Also deposits held escrow equivalent three months rent. Typical leases 5 years.

It's different renting far secure, however difficult find place people need borrow deposit money. done paying monthly fee lender, usually around 10 CHF month. Hospitalizations dramatically peak pandemic, good indication active cases decreased RO lowered. Steroids very, good taking immune system good number notches.

Anybody easily make mask buy one almost store Amazon could give people arguing boxes full masks favorite sports team's logo, cartoon character, whatever, they'd still fight tooth nail it. insane.

What see part root problem went lockdown asked people alter lives major way. lockdowns over, think people want asked more, effect got minor flattening curve followed spikes we're seeing masks, even homemade masks, touted beginning rather lockdowns, might've palatable solution encourage broader sustained participation. 

I'll freely admit medical background I'm basing position I've read news studies well observations quickly things returned ""normal"". Yep, already late locked down. No, they've mandatory month now. Airlines saying they'll put fly list refuse keep on. Yang wrong though. rate automation jobs 2009-2020 lowest three centuries.  seeing labor productivity rise. There's nothing pay UBI. like everything else released 100% confirmation anything. says might things look promising need data Wish was. doubt they'll ever actually ask information, but... Better start figuring going get 3 activities week. mentioning two different numbers, daily reported new cases daily reported new deaths.

The daily new cases increasing due increased testing.

The daily new reported deaths going 0 100 depending lag reporting (few staff working sundays report, wednesdays synchronising databases 30 days old). deaths booked actual day, easy see decline since mid april high.

Data FHM: deaths showing delay reporting: example june 5: 37 dead far, 77 NAHT COLD! It’s gonna awkard safer countries start relatively normal life stubborn ones still denial(cough cough US,Sweden, Brasil, Russia...) Yes, time away stigma :) People ‘don’t like’ wear mask pandemic dicks, babies coddle. 

It ‘major discomfort’ anybody, sorry. 

That’s selfish means. It’s selfish willingly spread virus want pretend it’s ‘major discomfort’, isn’t.

It’s sort personal choice style statement, it’s precaution pandemic rational educated person would see. It’s choice, social responsibility. 

Like said before, you’re different drunk driver selfishly subjects others risks personally wouldn’t want face himself. matter social responsibility, need wear mask, stop pretending it’s ‘major discomfort’. 

It weighs 15 grams, child. Good thing don’t. I’ve told tell fuck right it’s great. Shore area here.

People parks, trails, etc, masks almost seen all. tell though go retail establishment, 100%. Yes, get morons occasionally wear right nose, masked. Personally, mask unless going go store area modicum amount people know. highest rates shore areas near retirement communities orthodox religious communities. Everyone else takes serious enough hold line. Yes. WAY legit sources like CNN FOX controlled US capitals.  Hey think sit restaurant bar open yet rule mask till eat drink. lied symptoms... ""People China eyes"". Fixed title many deaths take 'til knows many people died?*

-Bob Dylan No, everyone pretty universally agreed system broken needs fixing. different ideas fix it. Also, find updates story, ends zero pocket. actual story got see hospital stay allegedly cost. lot people breathing great intensity - large volumes air body. amount virus particles emitted in-taken larger.

No larger amount, distance travel much farther. Rendering 6ft distancing rule almost pointless. think keeping people safe distancing little bit, really people spread 2-3x far normal everyday situations people breathing normally. china arrest disagree I’m going honest, that’s ineffective. people know it. 

It’s medical theater it’s good show. place it’s safe enough want people wear mask, it’s safe environment mask. end. 

So you’re trying convince people come restaurant talk eat it’s really safe so. it’s actually safe mask necessary. There’s really between. Almost everyone thinks way. virus wanted.  ain’t lyin horseshit upvoted. Christ It’s infective, less lethal. finding something totally different lungs, deterred summer months. seems like every time make assumptions based viruses wrong.

Which normal - actually new - concerns lack knowledge means advise people take precautions FEWER precautions - that’s dumb. south shouldn’t shut begin could shut now. entire nation shut time mistake. Teen Wolf? kind noped episode two show first aired. think column column B. LOT talk Swedish social media bout high death toll, avalanche critical editorials DN, SVD, Aftonbladet, Expressen, etc. high death toll. Also plenty adressing news shows like Agenda, Akuellt, etc. Love /r/freefolk &amp; /r/coronavirus crossover used “get link” page provide earlier link - idea didn’t work.

I analysis, simply trying find best available info understanding may help. don’t say necessarily unsound, also firm proof sound document lists potential disadvantages well. Many people want argue “their side” I’m saying neither side “right” point. Science doesn’t say masks help, guidance says potentially could help.

From view best action limit interaction, distance sanitize/hand wash often interact. seem proven actions, masks (and document lists potential disadvantages masks). went pick prescription yesterday cvs. pharmacist wasn’t wearing mask person ahead commented it. pharmacist replied “I’m sick I’m sure I’d know was”. Fuck No, hasn't. race vaccine before.

As often case, reporters facing deadline needing story write. researchers working vaccines watching news saying, ""Ok guys, looks like outbreaks, let's really put effort today!"" well safe travels opinion, protect people Beijing rest China.

\--From Beijing citizen TIL state deaths entire country Sweden. gotcha, ty makes feel better she’s aid. support staff tend dumb. mother 86, limited time left reality she’d already wasted 4 months lockdown. made decision go back much normality terms “is life fear life worth living?”.

It’s case assessing risk relatively good health age.  florida we've doubled starting. Deaths come next. kind wore masks wed mess. afford healthcate Haha haha. wear mask then? Cause politics keeps off. don’t lie symptoms... Got it, Swedes handling whole thing better makes uncomparable? aware people responsibilites, mind offering insight, people Sweden also breaking rules.

And since comment actually density, incredibly low density Detroit play part? Or, take low density Helsingfors, make Sweden Finland uncomparable? Fascinating many nursing home residents fought WW1 We're safe bullshit anywhere, we? Agreed, go whats actually criticize discredit making shit up. What... surprise. Psh communist propaganda brainwashing /s went Home Depot yesterday 1/2 customers wearing masks. fucked country! People die every day. think matters why? Dead dead. hell would go one anyway? Yeah bullshit. Went protests I’m from. Almost masks except media. depends state/city I've tried using neck gator mask miserable experience. Actual masks much better. Im sure sweating mask would reduce effectiveness. dont think thats issue. FYI, daily COVID-19 deaths world wide 7K range peak. 120K close daily death rate illnesses, accidents, old age daily world wide. (An interesting chart, idea many people died diarrhea every day).


The US seeing 800 900 deaths day range. downplay it, that’s insane number. flu kills ~130/day flu season. impossible Meetup.com thing. I'm nearing 40 went bunch meetups get new friends years ago, ended could realistically keep with. past years number trickled something manageable.

I also started monthly gathering one main hobbies, board game design, invited several local designers playtest everyone's designs, I'm pretty good friends six new people that. Right we're sharing ideas group chat, meeting virtually playtest, great group we're actively trying help out. lawyer's promised land. i'd rather test isolate 3 days waiting result isolate 2 weeks Probably vaccine. give fuck anything except next election. watching short Joe Rogan clip Bill Burr. talking masks manly said, ""Oh touch open nose open thoat."" hilarious. also sad. Masks sign weakness. weakness pretend something like exist scary. Maybe that’s don’t care, then. people can’t afford luxury quitting job. Unemployment benefits awful states. fixed you. don’t close state borders that’ll case... make assumptions virus based strains SARs.

This type SARS.

It's new strain SARS lethal successful. higher death toll stirred debate allowed travel rest Europe. cannot decline enter country.

I went B&amp;M last week gardening supplies people wearing masks chavs. seem care others wearing them. Ok imagine wearing mask periodically swipe hands alcohol.

How many think would infect? think people realize bad is. Yes tests finding cases, numbers staggering.

China reported 31 cases Beijing, yet cancelled 60% domestic flights city's airport.

On March 17, New York closed bars restaurants. reported 1,009 daily cases day.

On March 20, New York issued ""PAUSE"" order closing non-essential businesses. reported 3,254 daily cases day.

On April 3rd, New York reported 10,841 daily cases, peak curve.

This Tuesday, Florida reported 2,783 new cases, Texas 2,622, Arizona 2,392. Nothing beats really good performance raincoat!   Hm, feel like might bit much soon, hey made good decisions probably quite justified thinking. guess depends consider ""acceptably safe"". know Sweden, probably UK. example Italy Spain qualify? interesting see play out. It’s “exceptionally” bad here. You’ll see. leaders decided pursue policy herd immunity without telling anyone. done it. Sooner later God's gonna cut down, sooner later God's gonna cut down. aimlessly destructive though. 

The cruelty régime point, even flagrant setting negative example without aim. aim project ""strength"" ""toughness""; message resonate stupid, i.e. base. 

Wearing mask is, course, sign respect others, naturally degrade it, thinking makes look ""weak"" ""foolish"".

I hope attend Nazi rallies, infect fucking die. avoid like plague best times. rest world 🌎 too. China pushing narrative control, Trump Pence try downplay virus every turn.

Russia pushing narrative country longer symbol peace, Trump calls law order president. 

How much money trump owe countries?

Can see amazon supporting protests way destabilize current economy. job becomes amazing 15 dollars hour? Amazon Jeff Bezos made fortune.

The poor people many countries live better lives kings queens hundred years ago. 

Though power may hands few, group always want more. push people, dividing see true strength. control true direction, changing focus ""allowing"" us pleasures sway attention control way thinking.

We sum collective individual parts. makes country great. Xi Jinping, Putin, Trump, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, J.P morgan, Saudi princes, Jeff Bezos charge. fantasy world turned planet power want, reality people wake (and are) power limited run out. 

Semper fi. grandpa going without mask, bars casinos. Literally highest risk places go to. continue wear mask public feels pointless since live absolutely get gets get way acting. Atleast mask know spreading thats reason enough wear it. Chile went mandatory lockdown may 13, capital city (Santiago) Social media embraced kind shit. Turned 11. Source? yet U.S. states getting several thousand new cases day, United States like, ""Yawn"" blm protests advocating civil rights reforms combat systemic racism isn’t going rally Here's millennials killing old people! is, mean catch flu diseases? Probably Trump would rather invoke act make meat production employees come work pandemic. like watching really bad comedy show It’s new virus. Literally. It’s actually new. Every time someone makes assumptions based viruses seem wrong here. It’s hard craft policy. mandatory quarantine foreign passengers need secure quarantine facilities individuals can’t trusted self quarantine home. takes money, organization, staffing. good. lot folks don’t understand this. like “2 weeks passed” it’s hoax! 

They also ones point COVID US since January also “hoax”! realizing true took March April reach peak.

Cognitive dissonance wishful thinking abound. verse that? article saying countries relax rules even cases Dude. said time. Isnt anyone's fault people attention span flea. people wearing homemade non-medical grade masks anyway (if they’re wearing masks) Well statistically even get won’t die IMO it’s pretty messed lot big cities reopening retail stores already... That’s I’m talking about

Ah, OK. well going argue diff issues posted, clarify points are, then, yeah, guess I'll assume *you're right* whatever unknown point trying make. Let guess, waivers still allow patrons sue individual employees instead business? Someone read comment  sends message know much now. way years. Same. Pittsburgh fucking disgraceful it. big city best see malicious compliance masks. I'm still basically locked can't trust people around here. Plus seeing makes stroke levels angry Right? Upsetting literally one cared put mask. He’s clearly bane. low-effort content co-worker Lemme get straight. Space Force couldn’t make masks. It’s cable television channel USA. EGO Returned local YMCA yesterday. Working mask extremely uncomfortable since inhale exhale heavily. Luckily basically entire place (with exception two guys lifting weights 50 feet away worked stair climber. didn’t wear one. don’t gas multiple times day caustic disinfectant. said since beginning reason masks recommended general public virus shown masks wouldnt matter would exacerbate shortage medical workers.

They've literally never changed they've said.

It's people never listened first place got news second hand people wanted know 'dont wear mask'.

A mask wont prevent person getting infected. get virus landing eyes; like every virus.

That's medical professionals wearing face shields.

A mask helps preventing infected people spreading it. using mask people werent likely infected waste.

I get isnt common sense; fuck people still falling bullshit presented as?

People legitimately think kind conspiracy, cant follow two three steps logic... course british people screwing up. forgot young people don’t interact older individuals! Silly me!  Oh ! I’m sorry. misread. Given china’s whataboutism, probably means don’t control either really think would exact thing ”learning lesson”. it'd one things “I cant believe happened me....again“

She seems like type person who, ”learning lesson“, would go back without mask since ”what chances I'd get again” Well get rootin toontin maskadaisical idea from? Correct, I’m aware country’s constant failure people. “CoViD fAKe DuH” said then, instead lied looked like fucking lying assholes walk back. better yet, co pay larger price drug. 100,000 people died. 

119,000 far, spiking upwards. agree. can’t bring vote liberal think good job quite like Gladys now. arizona ? idiot brother claimed day Fauci contradicted himself.

keep weeks ago spouting 5G nonsense.

i think pretty obvious early needed wear mask. Reddit echo chamber yes None legally enforceable anyway, like someone never prove single business definitely caught virus.

All giant waste time. catch 22 capitalist solution. know live country shitty profit Healthcare system actual crisis wont able get supplies. also know buddies congress allocating money patients have. SOLUTION- Make sure people get infected assembly line workers enough proper equipment meet demand.

Win Win ChaChing! mean masks won’t filter virus even ones effective without proper fit testing. get might question strategy initially. evidence, (I hate phrase goes...) common sense would tell everyone wearing mask prevent wildly spraying virus around it. 

The real gripe front knew jump, said “please keep N95 masks medical professionals work high risk environments. everyone else, face covering prevent spread why”. 

But then, I’ll never forget people turned animals hoarded supplies moment got real. mad correctly predicting 330 million people buying masks would bankrupt

Yeah, right. possibly alternative solution (homemade masks.) finite # masks, &amp; public wearing masks necessarily means healthcare workers would forced go without.
LYING American public, thus *increasing* spread def best tactic-- best general public &amp; best 1st responders.

/s obv Woosh frustrating feel like way opening bit rushed wolf gave political concession STILL wanna try overrule him. hate fucking state much time. Wolf great job hey fuck corona hoax right?  tried use explanation heroes wife once... Ugh, went grocery store day driving home scratching face realized sanitize hands first :( luckily young one really spread man virus good hypochondriacs. I’ve read exercise especially bad you’re expending lot particulates air exertion person said matters lot live. going try find also went local gas station got air head, too.  Given mild inconvenience fact rhat certain vulnerable groups still risk, wearing mask seems like another shining example selfish American behavior. Good, first thought would opposite, left, want wear mask. Good cares others cares health.

He definitely risk group regardless much trained body.  I’ve jogging mask on. It’s fucking fine. really bad. Especially right now. state massive Covid surge hanging BARS.

Newsflash, happening everywhere world. source Mobile hospitalizations, cannot find any. haven’t seen boyfriend consistently 3 months he’s essential freak periods gets time long enough quarantine (2 weeks), may able sneak seeing weekend goes back thick it.

My county opened mask-requirements.

People aren’t wearing masks.

I’m fucking pissed. 

As someone following protocol, probably going beyond, fuckfaces going maskless makes want go rampage. Selfish fucks. article says exeptions international students essential workers (this latter one would understandable workers necessary fight coronacrisis, EU broad term). rules apply EU countries high infection rate. schools open go business. ""pretending virus burn out"" acknowledgment can't hide caves forever Could article written poorly... mean whole world? Personaly, think put seasons, treatment vaccine, since probally not, probally seeing replacement players NBA NFL year. like anti-establishment rather biased. horribly uncomfortable.

You find better fitting mask. Unless you’re working 8 hour ER shift worn scarce n95, decent mask normally won’t rise level mild inconvenience. Wow, asked serious question I’m getting confused you’re upset We’re around day 20-25. started 1 person hundreds thousands people many know infected 

Should plenty see spike cases respiratory issues aches/fever? probably covid thinking something like this. I’m trapped crazy sci-fi movie hoping get out! good example person affected one sided reporting India. like him. read it? governor's saying this? Um, can't *do something*? bought every roll toilet paper available despite never, ever, danger running mad correctly predicting 330 million people buying masks would bankrupt entire world's stockpiles PPE? problem is, know going year.

A lot plans nonsense context duration unknown. They're viable long term solutions. well usc class fall that’s 40k kids swarming small city. included It’s self loathing. lived abroad long time. really bad. Especially right now. state massive Covid surge hanging BARS. doesn't. N95 never available public. always stock. government wants hoard supplies, easily negotiate contract manufacturers. Read this, literally claimed mask help preventing spread virus. Word word. stupidity another level. Maybe kinda will. take couple weeks year get kind like flu we’ll come nickname start worrying get old, along illness could kill us age. hoarded condoms nefarious reasons certificate got tiger repelling rock says also prevents world war 3.  This. Take Wire's report bucket load salt. Wire long history propaganda reporting always favors current opposition party India. live locally NWA well I'm glad implementing this, wife works one hospitals locally literally making bring masks supplies, protection sparse, opens exposed rise cases. bad situation I'm sick tired willfully ignorant walking around pretending exist. report much better last one predicted 26% Stockholmers infected May 1.

Now estimate virus detected 10 days instead 5. also changed 75 undetected cases found 44. (I still believe 44 bit high).

This report also based PCR test late March / early April 2,5% Stockholmers infected. randomized study 67% invited participated. suppose people symptoms willing participate PCR test 2,5% bit overestimated.

This 0,6% IFR account excess deaths either, (which mention) Stockholm quite high rate excess deaths (more deaths normal + Covid deaths) april guess IFR closer 1%.

But much better study first one. lo, know... meant people 50 still 0.1% chance die, nothing nothing less. give free everybody stand example free healthcare works better. 

but like piss people afford give another argument universal healthcare. Wonderful world ahead. One superpower failing follow basic containment measures blaming others consequences. superpower failing detect report borning pandemic time blaming others consequences. adults room crazy. BC, I'm freaking cause went 1-5 cases couple days row going back around 10 cases day several days. Yet individual states reporting thousands cases daily keep opening shit mandating life-saving recommendations like wearing masks. Young/Old matter..they incapable following simple rules..dont want lockdown least wear mask done nothing young old right thing...I live ny I'm 32 know survive corona without problem..but respect elderly ppl preexisting health problems vulnerable virus follow guidelines...imagine virus spreading specifically targets 13-40 aged ppl grand parents didnt give crap normal things..how would feel.. got super birds. multiple types feeders different types seed bird bath clean daily. MANY birds, it’s fun watch them. know common ones trying identify others. understand now. Birds neat. long China deny it? take away fairy tales August park space imagination November deaths etc, serious facts terms? 
Because measure much shorter countries knew confirmation till anything true. wrestling fan base leans way progressive would expect Afaik want make decentralized apps Europe work make compatible. Eventually toxic. amusing unlike nuts here. still friends. Yes, traffic lights maintain order interest public health reduce collisions interest city keep flow traffic going. 
As citizen driver also interest traffic rules applicable all.

Wearing mask also interest public health, order limit transition virus much possible. human could affected daughter elderly parents, interest limit stop virus.

Can seriously see connection? people would stop dying death rate wouldn’t high. Problem solved Nah. China already spanked them.

Modi stop trying start shit China, focus getting domestic situation control. like India use effort stopping spread disease. Yes, traffic lights maintain order interest public health reduce collisions interest city keep flow traffic going. 
As citizen driver also interest traffic rules applicable all.

But sorry, might confused mean. 

Do mean genuinely believe evangelist Jim Bakker, says colloidal silver actually cure save infection Coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2 virus) body? 2 problems. young people obeying health guidelines catching least shared responsibility fault. 2nd problem, keeping 15,000 hospital beds free next Covid-19 surge treating happens them? Everyone: ""Know what, fuck corona virus. Lets riot start wars shit instead."" 
Corona virus: ""Nah nah, keep that, we're getting good part."" lied going straight destination, lied contact anyone. 
I’d put money piss side road too. gullible believe Chinese numbers. 105 cases could 10000. Look New Zealand, Germany, Taiwain ways battle coronavirus China. bought umbrellas wear hat hands free. Super handy feel like much tool seen it. probably right.  really, really hope gets it. One good cough take good. didn't. like policy take mask entering gym. sense essential, keeps idiots watch wrestling front tv wich means around wearing mask cause two demographics probably overlap Guess what, apart black death, compare mass death event population none seem bad.

It's really valid comparison anyone saying lead extinction humanity. 2020 summarised. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* shit, people acting like going brand new type disease produce immunity want sell fear worst part companies sending bunch emails newsletters they're protect us precious customers employee one companies never hear peep they're us--if union. PA restrictions, nowhere near strict states. I've seen headlines jurisdictions across state, announcing intention enforcing governor's orders.  thing going us years rate, theres going back used think normal long time. mean, really American people saying president saying...... like ""western world"", one really knows what's going China since can't read/access China media. Therefore took president mainstream media feeds them. Aliens ""Cheap"" we'll see long lasts is, two experimental vaccines CNBG already offered employees large state-owned companies intend travel overseas, Bloomberg** **last week**

Good learn vaccination officially underway. Phase II trials demonstrate high level neutralising Ab's, severe side effects, ADE, fair enough offer intend travel. still told take precautions.

For want vaccine 5-year safety profile, ready 2025. Good know companies backbone (Kroger employee here) simple idea, ""no muh freedoms!"" nothing, though. Even fit perfectly still going better nothing before. That's like saying people wear condoms wrong one bother. referring something specific? may case US. last times went shopping groceries Germany everybody wore mask. People seem struggle keeping distance waiting line. Overall witness anybody complaining, though I'm sure are. can't speak indoor places since any. view fact Isn’t tests easier get , anyone get tested now, mean ethical clinician looks different measures virologist. ethical clinician might say look lifes old people jeopardised, skin hunger, isolation, tragic. virologist looks immediate deaths virus. sure lockdown works bring spread factor disciplines like economic downturn, hunger Africa, make base points based scientific research. Remember Australian airlines (Qantas, JetStar Virgin Australia) still banned international flights amidst pandemic.  understanding contacted ceos big business first order try put economic plan order medical. anybody know far am? It’s global. countries season time. stats see globally pandemic virus spread throughout world within different climates seasons. tell position talk things happening florida snowbirds gone months lol. America Although ironic lockdown measures applied literally everyone except gangs rioters looters, burning communities down. wrong case tho Thanks response. I’m actually Ontario, Canada. work busy tourist mall get lots people coming Toronto GTA, hotspot You, like us western Europe tobl lesser extent, rock hard place. Lockdowns expensive, failing control epidemic also expensive, potentially even more.

This natural catastrophe, ways put taking seriously before. 

But I'm also skeptik economic prospects econony opens virus controlled. I'm afraid many bussiness open less customers (out fear etc) losses even bigger staying closed, ""only"" fixed costs least minimize costs, like suppliers. oh china did, 0 new cases long. newest outbreak control already back 0 new cases.

very true. pooh would never lie worked restaurants bars past although food hygiene practices actually always in-line health standards, cleaning front house area always crapshoot.

I mean 50+% bars always smell like stale beer 3pm afternoon open, ain't getting deep cleaned well.   really isn't. people think retirees dying bad economy? absolutely net positive, pensions longer paid, they're working. *is* good economy eliminating disease like NZ people go back life normal, Sweden right now. People still going spending much normally would. That's bad economy. Grandma dying? Good economy. dude shaming people count? next what? people read? Completely douchebag false statement. want area clear, keep away.

But never met anyone requiring 6 feet bubble around far I'm starting think cooped inside online put sort echo-chamber. I've occasionally work errands seem like majority people wearing masks practicing social distancing, I'm Reddit social media, feels like majority well aware seriousness.

It's sort blowing away feels like different realities COVID. I'm Reddit, feels like we're majority; I'm back regular world, feels like we're minority.

If imagine Reddit news, rest world would seem pretty normal me. Anyone feel similar? science? wear bandana, cut shirt, scarf. cut shirt blocking virus. Try spitting mouth full water old shirt, try valved n95. 

A step find politiical. course comes San Fran. N95 mask protects wearer. We're told wear medical n95 takes doctors. wear valved one let's virus out(with scientific proof.) wear masks protect us protect others instead. like shouldnt able guns protect ourselves, rely police protect us. get rid police, people saying arm protect ourselves? course NOT. I'm sick bullshit ""Utopia"" told can't protect myself. Technically truth. ""It's pneumonia bro"" - President maybe people US care someone close falls seriously ill dies it.  Huh?

China's recent outbreak tied contaminated imported food community ZERO cases months. area zero, restriction necessary all. anything, China erring side caution.

Same NZ, also zero longest time. Again, risk due imported cases, country need anywhere near restrictions place community transmission still spreading disease.

China NZ America India, probably necessary require heavy control. 119,000 dead nothing 330,000,000.

If infected entire country flu first time ever would get many deaths. get huge surge first vulnerable people die nobody immunity massively slows young people can't die immunity starts building up. county everyone’s wearing masks stores many even walking around. mask shaming here. Probably thanks rapid growth cases Brazil, Russia fewer number deaths. like quite though -- elites top relatively big population average compared to, say, west europeans? point US managed operate like since managed attract top minds Europe WW2, keep going suppose Clearly, nothing America fire, so. /s dude MATHS ROLL!!! Quick, 60% work to??? Ха ха flabbergasting numbers idiots probably even higher past, considering people mostly illiterate still humanity managed progress even fly space. Yeah sub weird. neither china coronavirus control. Take plane wear mask. 10 hour drive could dangerous. america fucking hard? Almost countries europe control opening mean fair said talking rising number positive cases. Something along lines ""we seen increase positive cases, due testing. stop testing, numbers would 0""

Seems like fair statement me, dont even like guy. guess makes easy pick headline readers. you, dude? Wanna apologize bit rude end. 

I clearly can't convince anything, maybe sources help:

Official study report posted : Study shows clear link age risk dying covid-19

PUBLISHED JUNE 16, 2020

An estimated 0.6 percent people infected covid-19 around second half March died. shows study Public Health Agency done Stockholm County.

In group 70 years older, mortality 4.3 percent, 0.1 percent among people younger 70 years.

\- results show clear connection increased mortality higher age. underlines importance protecting elderly infection, says Lisa Brouwers, head unit analysis Public Health Authority.

The Public Health Authority calculated percentage infected covid-19, including unconfirmed cases, Stockholm County died. estimate number deaths based selection confirmed cases tested Stockholm County fell ill March 21-30, 2020. data cases taken SmiNet, database reporting system communicable infectious diseases Sweden. estimation total number people infected cases sample infected.

Knowledge proportion die (lethality) important assessing consequences pandemic. Along Swedish report, technical report also released English details study. live North Cali, people wearing masks people stopped wearing masks businesses. Bars opening soon :/ social pressure. places like japan wearing masks normal would ridiculed wearing one. Um...I'm confused called pro wrestling. actually competitive wrestling. professional actors though.  Afaik vast vast majority spread direct respiratory contact used 9 years reference last time released book. 1996, 1998, 2000, 2005, 2011 release years books far. there's secret math pattern release dates, I'm seeing it. 2 cases New Zealand yesterday call army literally said cloth masks essentially useless. I'm glad responsible wearing mask, advocating 1000's people gather large groups. guarantee everyone wearing mask, even cloth mask, virus would spread much less wearing masks all. Cloth masks useless, simple logic. contradict myself. said cases actively hidden anyone. Please, read comment replying. first time rambling nonsense this.

The curve they've talking always number dead. Always. lot relevant number infected, also directly showing delayed picture number infected. long death curve going down, absolutely way number infected going up.

But since one trying prove type conspiracy theory, I'll expect give proof it. see people pulling noses masks

They like show penis public we’ve learned things virus. Herd immunity desirable - Like coronavirus based infections, develop lasting immunity infected recovered - population longer passes infection immune system stops letting us carry infect others. antibodies put pretty quickly it’s like first catch become spreaders infection. This, aggregate population, effect blocking path virus toward infecting others. hits someone immunity, falls away transmissible harming vulnerable sections population downstream. 

So even virus made extinct, much much less mobile population. true measles. It’s started stop vaccinating children (who considered super spreaders due social interactions crowded schools acting funnels/hubs transmission), virus started reappearing. COVID19, reach 70% immunity threshold (computed transmissibility factor disease), establish relatively safe environment normal social interaction groups.  

Immunity doesn’t mean you’re danger infection, helps everyone around catching you. Multiply large population, that’s herd immunity. odds catching infection falls dramatically around you. lord calling home go every fucking time? exhausting man. 

Nobody wants shut forever. want safe reopening...which means mandatory masks, free mass testing, effective contact tracing, gradual opening non essential businesses risky. well actual enforcement existing regulations. 

Since literally none place leaders squandered time strict quarantine...there way currently safely open figure shit out. impossible...they could tomorrow right order...many countries around world done fine. 

Without this, curve stay flat. said, whole point lockdowns first place lost. 

In mean time, theres big difference opening we're now, gradual opening everything. fucking stupid, can't see that, also stupid. 

Its tiring many people dumb understand this. Like can't smarter? learning disability? parents help homework? super frustrating. really wish exist man. fr.

A placebo controlled trial would still running, significantly fewer patients. lovely Trump fullfill promise ""clean swamp"" whole GOP getting infected covid cause allow wear masks? latest case coming India means India's situation also serious, boarder closure also needed there, there're already students China Hong Kong showing symptoms schools Hong Kong. already alert. guys.... time drop it. ...it worked Europe, too, without strong borders. wish beach pics would stop used articles.

Seems like want excuse belittle crisis go ""back normal"" know they'd test negative antibodies. people want dead not? don’t get No. Others contact quarantined. Several attempted get tested could return work sooner denied testing asymptomatic. So, area, still allowing people tested both: symptomatic exposure known positive.

I'm you, saying nobody site currently positive it. really shocked one positive thus far. others tested different times come back negative. could sail yet? know this? Hearsay? lived Sweden another representative western nation equal amounts time observe this? spouting things everyone says Reddit. Hong Kong thousand cases population 7.5 million. near open border China. Also, I’m sure trigger people, societal impact disease predominantly kills people retirement age vastly smaller effect society compared war predominantly kills young men 20s productive years ahead them. There’s big difference 100,000 people dying otherwise 5-10 years left live vs. 100,000 people dying 40-50 years ahead them. deaths tragic, keep mind.

Comparing pandemic war dumb. ""the best toad suspended legs chimney three days""

I think hornet nest part makes big difference. Assuming army beaten populance rifles can't much army planes tanks. father law doctor said “everything fine 18 ventilators left” social distancing living fairytale. arguing months it’s going get worse. told dangerous elderly??? Good him! people would this, coronavirus would cease thing. could go lives normal majority wore face masks practiced frequent hand washing/sanitizing. FACTS... ""The council consider appeal state emergency order ends""

This quote bill. good enough me. get sometimes imposing restrictions freedom order protect public necessary. restrictions automatically revoked explicit criteria met showing risk public minimized. I'm height always called effect 'giraffe-head'. 7 figure hospital bills

Even insurance companies cover treatment Covid fully... big most... workers absorb costs hiked premiums years come... glad best healthcare system world. simple folks....wear mask (properly), keep polite distance, avoid indoor crowded venues time being.... ""Stop paying attention US - China?""

This argument much convincing two months ago. fully expected see piles bodies. never materialized.

The world's greatest surveillance system almost certainly good disease tracking. world's largest dictatorship, disappear people COVID can't infect others.

I mean, assume they're lying ""31"" practice nothing else, given fairly forthcoming revealing new outbreaks, think China, like countries took disease seriously, downturn.

I wonder reason people always try divert conversation China, even story _absolutely nothing whatsoever China_ willing look United States badly doing. 

But know, even China lot worse, would sort excuse badly American doing. least China attempting prevent spread virus - unlike United States. see wtf? Im clueless too...

Utter bullshit. start Ardern bragging shaking hands COVID patients get sent intensive care catching virus. think early speculate. Swedish numbers could, like place, go again. mean afraid vaccines incredibly low risk injury (like 1 million less), definitely scared Covid.

I'm afraid think people be, I'll still best avoid it. failed state. run lunatics put profits people. parties it. accept it. mean yeah. live NYC bf became symptomatic mid-March. told everyone moms stay home, don’t get tested lack testing/risk getting infected hospital actually sick. friend works NYC hospital said weeks literally tiny, tiny quota COVID tests allotted per NYC’s hospitals, tests 70 percent accuracy. boyfriend *finally* able get tested end May antibodies. positive negative. 

So don’t understand people quick dismiss logic. That’s huge chunk valuable data we’re missing literally enough testing beginning. Let’s say tested literally everyone early end March/early April numbers *insanely* high—don’t think would affect comparison rates things could reported? 

In way shape form saying shouldn’t continue taking seriously keep practicing safety measures scientific-based information re: virus, really lost likely would valuable data first really hit country March. numbers rising tests available people take so... well, yeah, duh. visit 30% capacity Disney park won’t care anyway... would able read Amazon box infections?

Suffering, lol. delayed picking mine covid hit. packages January February can\`t pick up. I\`m going bite bullet pay \`push north\`service get GF\`s birthday gifts. careful making decisions based antibodies. Several people get infected virus create antibodies. Herd immunity kill off, though, makes spread low-level endemic. herd immunity vaccines lot illnesses still spread flare ups areas insufficient vaccines (think hear measles outbreak).

The problem NZ becomes still population that's nearly 100% naive, meaning really can't allow anyone without strict measures even herd immunity elsewhere. expect even strict measures, they'll continue situations like come up.  Herd immunity really apply tight quarters. shove everyone single room COVID+ patient week, everyone getting sick, 60%. Herd immunity depends lot conditions, bug.

So could still something 40% people naturally immune. find compelling argument, knowledge entirely disproven. Honestly, there's probably better time get elective surgery.

Hospitals bleached polished brim - interact Covid ward people taking far precautions sanitize clean ever probably last 100 years.

I work medicine friends triage nurses surgeons - amount care they're putting keeping common areas especially Covid-19 wards clean immense (Not going them).

Most hospitals stopped elective surgeries keep ICU beds clear - ones restarting going taking hefty precautions make sure everyone goes properly taken care of. Hospitals want lawsuits deaths anyone else. narrative typical people problem alcohol.

OK!!!!! writing this, Mayor rode order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! time read articles sweden point badly failed. 

If think Sweden failed simply media said failed, extremely foolish. countries got situation control, increased testing least order magnitude, distributed millions masks, 

Most countries tested less 10% population. 

Virtually antibody testing done anywhere. 

Italy Germany countries launched tracing apps . debatable many people actually use them. 

And handful countries distributed meaningful amount masks general public. Sweden took wrong path others months ago. 5000 avoidable deaths. 

The UK, Spain, Italy Belgium introduced measures lockdowns mentioned. fared worse Sweden. 

You consider Sweden's approach out-and-out disaster consider qualified success, depending point view. honest, trying prove one approach better another nothing glorified pissing contest. 

The fact virus cause expotential death Sweden, health care systems collapse vast majority people unnafected it.

Could 5,000 deaths avoided? No, possible.

Could 5,000 deaths reduced? Possibly. argument based purely hypothetical notion without lockdowns, mortality rates would much higher. nothing concrete back assumption up.

On flip side, look countries strictest lockdowns - Italy, France, Spain &amp; UK - also highest mortality rates per capita. could argue cases lockdowns actually made problem worse.

But nothing concrete back assumption either - *we're still dealing hypotheticals.* still pissing contest. 

The applies whole Sweden vs. rest Scandanavia debate.

At minute, ony thing take - terms reducing mortality rates - lockdowns might worked, might have, - depending viewpoint - Swedish strategy either qualified success out-and-out disaster.

Looking Europe whole, C-19 situation was, everywhere - number deaths peaked April delcining steadily since then.

Other difference mortality rates, *there discernible difference pattern applies countries, regardless measures put place.*

That would suggest important look effectiveness measures judge future actions, also look countries higher mortality rates common.

In top rated countries, *one common denominator* nursing homes abject failure case provide increased levels protection them. I'm sure that's factor, consider 60% deaths occured nursing homes countries, certainly points one major factors.

 good arguments made imposing strict, *limited* lockdowns. certain areas, strict lockdown necessary prevent hospitals overrun - applied countries even selected cities large, dense population limited number ICU beds per head population.

And lockdowns imposed long takes flatten curve. lockdowns extended beyond that. Anything beyond suicidal terms economy, people's mental physical health, education etc.

So keep banging old 'Sweden wrong - killed 5,000 people' drum, end day, pretty fucking pointless, honest. Yeah grad student NYC one lives like without parental help independent wealth. That’s 7 train for. Texas start something differently going continue go up. Expecting different result thing definition insanity. momma always said stupid stupid does.

It also flies face CDC recent publication symptomatic CFR .4% rejected scientific community large part. experience well. 10 weeks. came back one wearing mask. office work typically 1500 people it. 50 core staff work now. work little areas together similar ""essential"" roles.

I've met eye rolls political lectures wearing mask. take mask eat, people immediately pounce wearing I'm huge hypocrite. None co-workers practicing social distancing get downright offended ask stay back. Lots open air coughing throat clearing too.

I know virus reaches one people outside work getting eventually well makes incredibly anxious. says many terrible things even take stuff context either. Drives bonkers Facebook friends post stupid political stuff whenever someone takes trump context. 

This definitely taken context. says really stupidly, I've actually say essentially thing people understand can't blindly compare case counts countries. 

I really like trump, dislike misinformation slightly more. ""If want test, get test""  fact inventor umbrella ridiculed first.

Without piece single evidence. ""There’s Netflix documentary this. maybe that’s miss information? allowed watch it?""

Just fact believe Chinese people allowed watch whatever documentary talking though... US particular moving towards one percent affected virus (and that's actual confirmed infections, never mind people infected friends family). virus also gonna dying anytime soon far see. 

I also hope realize ""helping 99.5%"" they'll get virus instead sacrificed 0.5% essentially sacrificed 100%. reality situation choice 0.5 percent getting infected everyone getting infected. Even factor effects lockdown, I'm sure worse virus could be. 1KidBlastoff139 points · 13 hours agoHere comes blame game. BLM tourists next. back China.

oh sure BLM coming blessing pandemic. can't wait ride ""we everything perfectly left leaning idiots started taking streets"". enough people wearing mask going bars gyms take good excuse keep living live blaming others Certain hospitals means every government hospital, i.e. anywhere nationwide symptoms. lot things make tainted shit rushed market.  Lol thats shit response. say anyone critiques anything?

I don’t like movie Make better one

Etc etc claim taking couple weeks ago. think that's fair. like bloke control ""sheer luck"". listened best scientific advice time, shut country. drive bus Sydney turned ghost town. people took seriously followed advise. decided ignore warning like politians would different position. vote next election like politics respect guiding Australia initial stages pandemic. troll plain dumb? Milano completely deserted. Italy opened borders june 3 tourists come back. need tourism. Yeah elevation masks thing tests free since mid-May. there's still lot tests every day. Even hometown 50k population still 50 test per day. Black death killed everyone, wiped entire cities out. kills people 80+ defect like immune system.

It's effectively variant common cold, worrying silly far likely hit car killed this.

If ebola death rates still common cold transmission rates fair enough doesn't. everyone wears one everyone protected. many states reopened restaurants, supposed wear eating, get walk around establishment. course, lots people ignore that. report agree quoted atealein. Cool. think one issue one not. Who's troll Bill gates failed?

we get Microsoft Huawei Chip now? Recently Iowa? waitress one person room wearing mask. ""But fair enough."" thought u talking Cyborg. weeks 2 days insulting bag hammers comparing intelligence Trump. another group people: wealthy. people big corporations businesses employ last group people really part second group. support over-ripe squash president gives ludicrous tax cuts, that, really pay attention rest bullshit. 


The wealthy apathetic nothing worry about. people really intact people circle. interact rest us, know, working class, peasants, will. afford pay people run errands use public facilities like public transportation. Keeping away crowds something default. 


Even get virus, matter much families get absolute best healthcare absolute best facilities money buy time.

The urgent care usually work heart Disney area Orlando, FL. US, paycheck LPN depends many patients come seen. parks closed, lost almost patients. tourists, patients means there's money pay staff. licensure, I'm expensive keep around one first cut regular schedule. I'm lucky since corporate lay off. shipped lot staff wherever, whenever make hours. I'm competing dozens others shifts. 


One places sent work Disney Springs temperature screenings guests. break taking temperatures overhead waste immune system bragging he's made million pandemic. brushed with, ""I know anyone even knows someone who's gotten virus.""

The majority Americans seem self-centered unholy level. Altruism empathy liabilities system glorifies individualism. Unfortunately, means majority Americans fall first group. terrifying. could Brazil, nope. Italy too, people going friends, beach, giving shit. like whole world forgot fucking pandemic. NWPA, mask wearing public fallen almost completely except business insists. employer never masked staff spite large notices saying every entrance, still one always masks entering building. sanitizer vanished there, too. Social distancing memory. local forums bleat moving life living fear. We're pretty well set bad hit, there's nothing prevent yup like regions Switzerland, France, Germany. Bergame must really safe 60% herd immunity. Two extra squirts. That’ll definitely stop primarily airborne virus tracks. Maybe even throw sign says covid allowed really make point. Data. look this. US something nearly effectively countries.

 look old good image photo is, bet says people 30 young. arent young . People 60 old. fucking human till get there. Guess wait see new cases pop Taupo etc next couple weeks..  Paying $6000 getting sick sound like good insurance me. Southern US going face devastating reckoning COVID. weep future. im ready it, honestly. tried awhile talk people, given them. 

They need learn things hard way, believe....we do... think they're dead tired. Good ole Magic. Always bringing positivity situation. IFR 0.58 Stockholm estimated IFR 0.7 Sweden whole. Seems pretty line reports. Things quickly turn around new president. US system gets voice majority heard (yes know perhaps oversimplified things little... Hopefully people make right choice time around) Good luck still forbidden foreigners enter China, since March. kind surprises people know that. Allow hope. Orange man bad.. Again... Alabama close second 66% 356 people tested (I assume church goers) came positive. absolutely insane transmission rate. know teachers adequately trained therefore cannot hope properly educate children.

Teachers world wide issue...

&amp;#x200B;

Hell teachers school Literarily teacher cant get fired even openly said kids bad never anything life stuff. light we've learned since made comments, probably right. Boo fucking hoo. another *muh freedumb* douche admit go bury dead elders. got really question humanity superpower state say something like this. Exactly.

Everyone wants go back normal.

But problem people want go back normal without taking steps taken get back normal.

So much privilege America can’t even deal weeks struggle stave decades struggle.

I’m glad income stable enough kids young enough looming depression shouldn’t affect us drastically, man failed. It’s amazing “listen science!” crowd gleefully ignores positive see data looks data validates worst fear. absolutely evidence it’s serious take serious protections (included lockdowns cases), it’s showing us pattern world doomed either. get 1%? You’d see age group excess death occurred adjust IFR accordingly group. would probably change upper bound maybe much overall. 

Personally feel it’s meaningless put IFR across board covid strikes differently different age groups. ""deep clean"". Wtf even mean say it. extra squirt clorox? really. Seeing amount people going fun (obviously work related purposes), it’s clear morons make large percentage population. girlfriend works daycare one wearing masks, special needs children bite, spit, sing. Yay. gullible believe Chinese numbers. 105 cases could 10000.

When doubt veracity someone's claim, correct move ""provide evidence"". incorrect move ""insert random nonsense agrees priors"". Using cases could 105 1 million cases could 10 Trump could space aliens Alpha Centauri

All things 'could' true. onus provide evidence truth. City pull liquor licenses! love somehow prisoners count, people. expecially considering many ar probably small crimes. Nah would close day deep clean open changes anything. They've already lost much go big go home time. fucking moron. 

There conspiracy round every corner there? Nothing bad unless hoax fake. Well friend hope rest deniers enjoy fallout this, country, economy president fucked. 

And funny thing is, could stopped happening......best luck  Blaming numbers isolated industries absurd.

There’s community spread throughout FL, trying blame jails farms isn’t going much good starts hitting churches.

I guess good news RNC probably won’t impact FL cases come August FL already well way record levels infection since DeSantis already declared victory doesn’t believe takebacks. history shown.

You one world superpower stability world war III. idea still alive Yeah definitely got nothing him, need make clear. response sickens exactly virus spreading rapidly U.S again. doesnt matter doesnt kill you, ignore risks actively help spread virus, kill someone. spread rhetoric, encourages same. 600+ deaths single day still pretty high,don't think? true. BMI outdated inaccurate 98.6°f temperature is. info collected 100 years ago range European-descent people. even dare run again? Spanish flu mutated MUCH deadlier strain virus caused crazy 2nd wave, please stop spreading bullshit. Sadly nothing ever shut town. people think it’s hoax. 😢 entrepreneur? Yep. electric vehicle designer? Yep. lot important ways relevant discussion? Sure. epidemiologist? Nope. 1x credentials do, none.

Being rich, famous, even smarter someone else make credentialed expert fields. also make infallible. Elon Musk already demonstrated lot ways COVID denier nothing short getting sick convince otherwise.

Keep listening people lies make feel comfortable. know comfort price, ignorance.

Essentially they’re children, I’m trying say really read World War Z.  think issue people like pretend doesn’t exist it’s hoax, questioning instead blindly following whatever they’re told Fox News doesn’t fit narrative. always search information, everything. Seems like Michael Scott thing say I’d actually use linebackers better example. considered obese. Ray Lewis 6’ 1” weighed 250lbs. Body fat around 8%. BMI 32.98.....Obese. BMI clearly flawed some. dothraki riding dark... Yep, that’s sub loves. people would lockdown till 2025 could know heard theory now. sounds extremely plausible people states would start getting much closer proximity inside time year since gets way hot outside long. Apparently don't, states opening back like theres pandemic begin Go back disinfectants sun god experts guess. Yep. Im scientist cringe see people try use PPE. fact. we’re still suffering optimism bias. everyone’s going back careful. I’m praying miracle. 

I hope contact tracing adequate.

We really seeing divide state state this.  U.S. enter war 1917. deaths COVID whole numbers far outpaced WWI. real questions are: losses proportion population are, rate deaths instance. people dumbass selfish shitheads. collective survival depends collective compassion...we trouble. far 2020 great year mortality. Less people dieing 2020 previous years. Get em Something still can’t understand Chinese whistleblower doctor die? mean odds that? young man. possible level you’re exposed impact severe symptoms are? Yep, Texas. Got gas busy QT. literally saw zero marks gloves (I use disposable gloves pump cuz FUCK that)

Legit watched 20 people go main entrance, one mask. even holding door walking right past within inches. It’s like every time get gas. People haven’t cared months. theres *massive* difference n95 style mask regular cloth mask. know better most....

the n95 masks protect others. still roughly 95% effective.

regular masks work everyone everyone wearing stop spreading disease dont necessarily stop becoming infected whatever already airborne around you. She’s social worker. pretty much scientific knowledge base general public. 

A bit misleading since article would make seem like she’s doctor, nurse, midlevel, etc Florida man continue wrestle gators regardless, always essential Florida man. It’s frustrating SC. neurologist?

Why doctors like this, seriously? business medicine want help people? I've seen stats, say masks get infected. certainly show data annual influenza worse southern states summer sad truth president made political wearing mask. Yeah, got it. point age victims though, something obviously drummed mad something. ""Twitter-era level laziness"" comparing death counts. Coronavirus far exceed American WW1 death count anyway even understand even thought bring age this. mean, indoors. good illustration everything right needing cave (in case, allowing inbound travel). Wow dedication. totally get tho. Public restrooms quite nasty misread post. Yeah, PRC dragged table kicking screaming.

Even were, seem counted wrong. Florida's economy can't survive local consumption, unless convince state international visitors ignore cases death, Florida's economy still fucked even consume death also question whether states honestly reporting numbers. seem lot business interests involved pushing hard re-open based health science. Florida got trouble recently firing health department official refused manipulate Coronavirus numbers make look better. I'm sure there's questionable things going behind scenes, surprise death/infection numbers states rounded down.  oh flu -- user r/CoronavirusTX posted recently ""official"" TX death counts diabetes, heart disease cancer higher usual year date.

label death however want -- dead still dead :-/ COVID Sharks thing soon... Conservative people shrugging anything inconveniences mentally lazy way life forever pandemic change approach? doubt people's mind living NYC whether virus ""real""... asking? way accurate.

i mean get (try spin locals good light since also local), even agree it. That's literally us wear, surgical masks. wish pictures signs show don't. 

Airborne precaution rooms use n95 respirators droplet uses surgical masks. surgical mask used cover nose mouth prevent germs entering.

Surgical masks work way better homemade cloth masks. Many cloth masks essentially useless. push provide America surgical masks slow spread. sure we've ""tired"" PPE stories, still real still much issue.

Plus, surgical masks comfortable breathable cloth masks. may even convert anti-maskers. Summary: Donald Trump realise already showing bias way investigation go.

I've never ashamed country 'Old Man Shakes Fist Youngsters; Galvanizes Support Shaky-Fisted Base' understandable realize humans highly adaptable. comfortable circumstances risks, profiles change (i.e. virus), get shock, react caution... fear becomes new normal. built fearful everyday, mind normalizes new risks moves on.

Good them. seen *single* person store business wearing mask since mid-April. *single* person. true past Sunday.

Just past two days, I've seen two people try enter Whole Foods without mask (one doctor's letter claiming exempt, let in, WF made friend put mask), yesterday dog groomers, receptionist wearing mask dropped dog still none picked dog up, also customer speaking picked dog wearing mask. Yesterday also went CVS two customers wearing masks (they together), two employees masks chins.

I really proud area 100% mask-wearing past two months, sudden seeing people unmasked across three businesses past two days seen *any* two months thinking coincidence we've probably reached end people caring participating safety measures. world saying ""the first wave here"" America thinks somehow included. What's 2 States things focus on. COVID-19 boogeyman hardly concern anymore.   I’m homeschooling next year, because, probably like Charlize (aged 44) dream, faith happening. 😂 Nobody going mention interesting part poll? part Americans believe country slightly less safe China actually safer rest world?

That's grade-A brainwashing, top notch. live nyc wearing masks social distancing numbers lowest country. Many places don’t practice cases skyrocketing. There’s much empirical evidence world prove handle virus

Not person responded to, but...

The virus pretty much run course here. (I'm city well.) 

Look state state data shown deaths per 100,000, see pretty much petered top states. Meanwhile, [""Oh spreading massively""] states like one-tenth death toll (or less) NY State. (NYC 208 deaths per 100,000, meaning 0.2% population died it.)

This aligns pretty evenly CDC statement infection fatality rate 0.25% 0.5%. means nearly entire city come contact it.

Also new studies come stating 40-60% people could already immune resistant virus already infected states? still ways go. Everyone come contact eventually. lethal, still know much that.

Based many articles, studies, expert opinions I've read past months, shaping less 2-3 times bad bad flu season. trashed global economy this? damage likely lead even secondary deaths actual virus could've ever caused. it'll young otherwise healthy people dying, compared Covid-19.

Of course, people continue wear masks indoors public keep increased sanitization efforts. point (like NYC) we're killing people staying closed we're saving.

A good article economics 80% Americans died Covid-19 older 65, median age 80. review Stanford medical professor John Ioannidis last month found individuals age 65 accounted 4.8% 9.3% Covid-19 deaths 10 European countries 7.8% 23.9% 12 U.S. people age 65, study found, risk dying Covid-19 isn’t much higher getting car accident driving work. California Florida, fatality risk under-65 crowd equal driving 16 17 miles per day. higher hot spots like New York (668 miles) New Jersey (572 miles), death risk still lower public historians astonished ruminate here. shut schools, sports, theaters, bars, restaurants, churches – government ignored rule law put individual rights hold – obvious huge distraction. focus aged underlying conditions living nursing homes. models nowhere included ended reality, even though reality upon us early February people nursing homes began die Washington State. seen long lockdowns began. modelers epidemiological profession need learn economists figured long ago. Human life complex accurately modeled, much less predicted. certainly pertains novel virus. governor mayor keep droning ""Virus bad, Stay home"" without thinking that's driving millions people poverty, poor health outcomes lower life expectancy comes that.

Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Fiji, Georgia, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Nauru, Nepal, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Republic Korea, Republic Moldova, Russian Federation, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, African Group Member States, European Union Member States, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom Great Britain Northern Ireland Uruguay

all countries support investigation, except smart genius one young going blame old dying it. complied rules, granted compassionate exemption could go grieve someone funeral. Now, F decided OK think testing releasing managed facility? need ask.

The first lockdown cost dearly, second lockdown would cataclysmic consequence NZ economy. guys deserve lose jobs incompetence jeopardising economy.  Let answer him

zero  Oh wow. knew warm? one big room working I'm one wearing mask. We're laptops. Machines designed portable allow work anywhere.

My boss left trip Florida today.

I guess go fuck gets back. true, think usa exposed population complete morons , surprised fall empire get gym. Fuck Pence, lickspittle traitor. lids public washrooms? ugh imagine shit piss 25% get vaccine. 70% areas densily populated might enough trigger herd immunity, works virus mutate every season ""like flu"". even take 70% still 1.4 millions. 1.4 millions death enough WEAR FUCKING MASK? feel sorry people/families get sick possibly die idiocracy. hasta la vista baby .6% people get covid die it. getting 2 mil number? agree risky, responding request papers support infectious period shorter commonly assumed. evil translates ""calamity"", evil/sin moral, ethical sense word. certainly terrible leadership. Kinda funny get people wear masks government make mandatory. people choose deserve get covid. like stupid people. Stupid comes age ranges. long push said dicks face let them

So long keep dicks hidden around. saying? Sweden put heir study. people 70yrs age death rate 0.1% still decreases declining age.

Cruise ships shown asymptomatic cases rate around 80%

&amp;#x200B;

So finally end shitshow death incarnated flying instantly killing anyone ventures house without facemask? Arizona South make sure America remains undisputed #1 Source? What? 0.6% total population, infected. expert ever suggested 100% population get infected. Estimates vary bertween 25,30% -70%.
In short 2 million people. moved Florida Cali yesterday 

I spent time FL. sympathy. Flat, hot, full trashy rude people, bad drivers. kind like Miami though. \*Vietnam titantron incoming\* leadership DeSantis guide thru FLA!!!!!! incompetence Rob Manfred Owners lead baseball played year period, much less October.

You elect shitty people make shitty decisions laziness downballot voting sides. Don’t hope voting tendencies change, elect different people. 
There’s myth politicians largely public good, that’s EXTREME minority them. lives lost country crisis next accept system have. 
RIP Robert Washington hope strength family. would certainly classified “Fake News”. Less 0.1% death rate population. 80% cases asymptomatic, shown cruise ships. 


COME QUICKLY, LOCK EVERYTHING, QUARANTINE EVERYONE, FUN ALLOWED BLOOD, SWEAT TEARS!!! want engage said person's tongue twisters is, sure.

There several examples Tegnell claiming Sweden reach full herd immunity May e.g. Take clip [in full immunity far ahead?  Well, modelers think happen sometime May ...

The point speaking herd immunity always instead vaccine. ""Since vaccine far ..."" implicitly ""we'll reach 'natural immunity' instead"". Thanks, say well 20, i'm saying closer 15, still figuring details. Oh, made Italy Chinese stuff. also thing seem significantly dangerous black people think many blacks sweden. mask fuck them.

Not literally, please. I'm suggesting that. gave two example (""Read compare:"") leave mean leave good leave day, explaining differ one used title article misleading. I'm pretty sure worse bars salons, several reasons:

1) lot people breathing great intensity - large volumes air body. amount virus particles emitted in-taken larger.

2) Touching surfaces touched lots people -weights, machines, benches.

3) touch face lot, wipe sweat - probably touching said surfaces.

Gyms pretty much worst place in. check dangerous conditions disease spread. used regular gym-goer, makes sad. :( hmmmm are...countries? going end mass produced, widespread, effective vaccine Yeah there's also middle ground. know worst lol Also, obesity factor, mortality rate could higher US. attention span gnat. excuse, truth. lot states strict lockdowns weeks, even months. can't stay way forever, can't stop virus spreading. months ago sub POSITIVE tens millions Americans would coronavirus right - don't. yet somehow response still disastrous. life must go on, risks must mitigated. individuals responsible, wear masks social distance. can't force them, though - better worse. body knows waves think people's aversion masks come knowing use it. think mob-mentality. People think, neighbor does. president US telling it’s better worse. 
 Millions Americans believe him. one finds laughable people still need told wear masks shit? You’d think stuff would common sense, given constant media regarding increasing coronavirus infections constant emphasis quarantine. THERE’S HIGHLY INFECTIOUS DISEASE IMMUNITY TO, LET’S CHOOSE THROW CAUTION WIND ACT LIKE THERE’S PANDEMIC. Pakistan's India's current rates relatively low considering populations steadily march upwards.

With combined population 1.5billion highest population densities planet could turn really scary figures months time. Advil thing due causing regulation ACE receptor would directly impact response it.

Realistically though, already taking antihistamines regularly, likely up/down regulation normalized. Champion! stats true? source? Seems wrong me. would still around 2 millions americans I'd like prove point licking doorknobs. they've conditioned years years years listening to/watching Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, etc. daily basis

The test incredibly invasive uncomfortable highly doubt submits sinus swab daily. partying quarantine lol. lining bars midnight Green Day. 
Ppl trying much dine chance get. 
Yea masks weren’t enforced much, touch masks much even quarantine. really think people don’t give Trump enough credit preventing second wave corona virus outbreaks ensuring first wave keeps going... leave please understanding mainly economic reasons. balance science says practical terms avoiding complete economic collapse.

It would better fighting virus everything stayed locked another months, sure, would cause even devastating knock effects. science primary concern, thing consider. 

The issue people seem take lockdown eased 'everythings fine', stop wearing masks social distancing.


TLDR:
The quarantine end tbh, based nothing, people dumb think means over. good/bad thing i'm guessing ethics may ranked high west there's one less hurdle get vaccine fast tracked Bars theaters last open. Drunk people squashed together always lean super close yell talking. friend idiot. can’t really trust quality anything made China, unless it’s virus apparently America first! already even quarantine. 
They partying since it’s impossible enforce. 
The reason number low bc minimal testing Shinjuku stop fucking cesspit disease 5 minutes shake this. thought annoying hosts stds worst risks, COVID threw window. seriously Seen girlfriend since March? 9/11 start. considering followers competent is, itll room full non-mask wearing old people. He'll effectively take voters own. clear. Populism deadly. current prices... yall insane Canada buy midwestern states already? Australian politics atm testimony that. PM went lowest lows incompetence mishandling bushfires December/January praised magnificent handling pandemic. election year would shoe-in. America wearing wearing mask become major political issue. One side (still) believes virus hoax librul sheep wear masks. Coincidentally, vast majority people three states mentioned article (Alabama, South Carolina, Oklahoma) members side. Magic Johnson? fault hugged kissed friend way isolation. fault lied symptoms. fault went public gym class. guess one hand leaders blame, another hand ton dumb people giving shit covid. Let’s use mask gather many public areas there’s incredibly infectious disease spreading worldwide. Sure, government hasn’t made situation much better living rock understand importance staying home much possible, wearing mask, avoiding populated public areas. ""leave"" always implies ""never come back""? Phrases like ""Leave good"" ""Leave come back"" needless additional words ""leave"" already means that?

He's leaving due (lack of) policy; policy changes, reason leaving removed first place. trust anything China? misled world months. wasnt researched published UK, US? know even elderly obese mild even symptoms right? They're far likely develop severe symptoms young healthy, certainly 100%. Trump among would get mild symptoms, imagine kind message would send followers. get antibody test antibiotics, affect results? seem really obvious blowing it? reasons? masks, social gathering etc.? get articles like this. People yelling panic shoppers calm down. Articles like relight fear panic shoppers kept anonymous, good thing hated lies selfishness. Narrator: *""they not""* Hey now! us voted guy got caught crack. still think could’ve done better job, Desantis sets low bar. I'm going assume rhetorical question. Antibody guarantee virus proof. Especially RNA virus like Covid 19. constant matter clean nation gotten virus, always vulnerable due international travel uncertainty associated unknown presence infectious individuals coming porous border. true NZ rest world. 

There way “bank” gains unfortunately.  small number presymptomatic cases compromise zero infection status time. true vaccine found. 

The next best solution effective therapy response mitigate severe cytokine storm effects mortality morbidity rates reduced significantly. nah, much space cheap real estate over, best time move least property Humans liquid though, feel entire volume pool. Given indias population density comparing countries deaths per capita think India done well come end less 500k deaths. reading saying that. 
It everything RNC convention coming Jacksonville. brought light day even asymptomatic people end amount lung damage? so, indeed irresponsible say currently. Honestly could made become national norm wear mask distributing cotton masks everyone even plain white cares since stupid CDC tons businesses kept preaching masks worn sick people masks inflict fear huge delay flip flop information confused everyone. Sad see POTUS take citizens health greater respect. Literally deserve blame. whole thing total letdown. governments, representatives, young people, older people, middle aged people, everybody Good know. went covid vaccine screening today. start trial couple weeks. Wiki census data 1910 1920

1910 - 92,228,496

1920- 106,021,537

I feel like interpolating right now, let's take 1920 data.

The US casualties WW1 listed 116,516 dead.

Therefore casualties amount approximately 0.11% population. Search patriots right? 8 January, Li contracted coronavirus unwittingly treating infected patient hospital.[27] The patient suffered acute angle-closure glaucoma and developed fever next day Li suspected coronavirus-related.[22] Li developed fever cough two days later soon became severe.[27] **Doctor Yu Chengbo, a Zhejiang medical expert sent Wuhan, told media glaucoma patient Li saw 8 January storekeeper at Huanan Seafood Market with high viral load, could exacerbated Li's infection.[28]**

High viral load considered medical expert contributing factor. 

Since corona virus new know whether Li taking extra PPE precautions since realise glaucoma patient it. Nonetheless, many hospital staff internationally far knowledge corona also died. Remember schools businesses closed March 8th. Ok published report also full English, noticed. is. could answer zero...  ”White House steps efforts...”

”Yay!’

”... downplay Coronavirus concerns.”

”Aw...” bunch anonymous people saying stuff internet open public debate.  I'm UK, living China. Definitely much safer enjoyable moment. Right. learn lesson protesters learned Rona! /s

Lmfao spikes major cities mass riots protest. knowledge medical field astounding Well, get there? morons elected him? show tested positive yesterday COVID zero symptoms even suspect carrier. Buckle boys girls, covid making comeback next weeks. Full list countries support resolution: Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Fiji, Georgia, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Nauru, Nepal, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Republic Korea, Republic Moldova, Russian Federation, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, African Group Member States, European Union Member States, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom Great Britain Northern Ireland Uruguay like view 2020!! Andddddd...... let’s worlds 2nd wave begin  beginning beautiful friendship. poor Dalits. *Reads title*

They us first half gonna lie Lol... mine literally trying convince PTSD, instead dysautonomia. 

Nope, never PTSD, even close! might soon... funny works.

I hope get care need. stigma chronic/invisible disease box fucking horse cocks. medieval. way drag whole thing.

the problem is, US one draged whole thing Yeah rioters careful obey restrictions. /s. 

Notice still 99.96% population alive. Dude, 120k dead counting fucked ""a bit""

If democracy defined public shrugs 120k dead... maybe democracy way go...

And yeah, China confused ability shrug off. people, understand old people can't die economy. Spain, Italy, Germany, France, UK combined (pop 325m) 2390 new cases today. Less states. Insane think couple months ago David Attenborough everyone know, even taking seriously going resuming life like normal! best friend, who's germophobe, diagnosed OCD super worried beginning text week said she'd town weekend baby shower, asking want hang out. NO! FUCKING DON'T! 

She told would 10 people family (have already contact tested sure) ? Doubtful. . I'm still abiding rules sticking hanging household that's it. mention we're breaking records almost every day cases deaths (Utah). 


Like shit gone, getting worse want go party hang out? Newp! Haha actually people China connecting dots starting think deliberately introduced country.

That's fucking stupid. Maybe skip dots?  second? RemindMe! 2 months feel like last 5-6 years many things feel obvious so, easy made incredibly difficult.

At beginning joked would cheaper easier buy everyone US hazmat suit. never really even thought compliance. figured everyone would inconvenience, long could keep working. realize can't even facemasks I'm done trying predict human behavior.

So many things. Like... taxes raised 2.1% children education, people rail ages. np norm ever since internet invented lol

The fact able know says ability freely access information.... try presenting making claim.  Lol , funny. actually scored another tax break move. /s? (I say jokingly nothing surprises anymore.) not. better grocery stores though. Luckily Portland leans left thus generally believes science, general experience people wear masks. Hating white women always favorite pastime white men. poor hurting wayy rich this. RemindMe! 4 Months trust anything guy says lies masks resulted knows many illnesses/deaths? Bet anything going go back statement month Yes, ones demanding ""investigation"" China.  What. a. fucking. mess. really ignorant. many wearing mask anymore. Plus whole administration taking joke. Tbh states are. list keep people fuck with. People 4 first names defintely top 10. thought anyone brain anywhere world view. It’s controversial mean? Death? underestimate effect effective governance. really helps trust government government actually something relatively competent it.

I mean, Netherlands people sick too, cases pretty much control now, making overall situation *much* better. They've barely cracked double digits. nowhere near achieving herd immunity probably can't it. body forgets coronaviruses pretty quick. People infected early probably able catch less year later.  Thanks lot people think fake happen. Typical American response /s? one felt like doc trying give lobotomy sinuses. sure anymore. whole US response makes sense people US .... know. China something similar back March free.

Now pay. Still makes mad basically neutered one badass women/characters series. pope busy slappin hoes, get line legal weed tho Unfortunately since they've put us yellow, thousands dumbasses acting like over. I'm optimistic trend last. right that, that's sad part.  Yeah come subreddit every often remind I'm literally insane. Nono, HIT gym, lawyer up, decleat fracebook. Honored coronavirus Troll #1 post. conversation co-worker lab, work therapies COVID-19. sister, physician, wedding month. specifically told co-worker, ""you bring masks want wedding pictures people masks, reception only.""

Just... oof. Bill Gates, first week hitting U.S., said least 18 months. That’s knew fucked. Ask think ? people NZ citizen resident, cannot decline enter country. OK let people mix general population without clear indicator.

Test may fail, even tested leaving isolation facility. magically travelled 600kms south without going store get supplies use bathroom even petrol. suspicious. oh, thought could taught love. “We together” load horseshit! essential workers putting lives onthe line will
Go broke, morons go bars protest without mask, rich celebrities big houses making music videos quarantined...we aren’t together! That's new cases Italy height it. think people actually want travel jaunt around mostly closed towns virus/looter stricken cities? Who's vacationing PA right now. bigger issue think college students come back. Headline might well ""There widespread view ~~China~~ WORLD U.S. pandemic control"" world lot 2 countries it. basically semi-lockdown (harsher real lockdown lot countries already) parents, coworkers. sucks. Well everyone Mason dixon line. Duh good Germany government release high-level design application layouts users analyze dismiss worry data violation. Interesting learn MD docs technology technique used behind scene. AWS, Openshifts seem selection host server. Data retention period set 14 days, valid me, since generally 14 days time required discover one Covid-19.

But title kind misleading, called open source me. Open-source mean **software** original source code made publicly accessible, freely available, modified. still unless affects someone know. Hospital rates already rising drastically 3 states people still care. Wait pandemic last year? theory NK terminated virus getting rid human(s) transporting it. Really?? Nickelback time like this? Take upvote get show us graph. Hating white women certainly never vogue now. Going comments past month wild wild ride paranoid President US record. UK. latest goalpost move never gaining herd immunity saving economy, rather protecting mental health. opinion second wave see 1000 less numbers USA total there's resurgence. unfortunately definition anyone elses matter government defines believe have. could wrong. enough, plus cases, deaths. see death counts rising, people take serious til means nothing them. haven’t first wave yet. effective anti-HIV medication called PrEP (Truvada). side $2,000 month. work though. 1239 new cases today. Shut fuck up, idiot. Basically whole Sweden shuts summer Typical American health care stupidity. make free. costs nothing next economic cost virus. Every common sense decision bastardized fit pro business conservative ideology. there's vaccine

Guess he's going shrivel girly man, majority population never vaccinate that. think fair say people afraid vaccine thanks creep Gates pushing hard track record vaccines nations would rather roll dice virus itself. Also, majority people would WANT vaccinate already dead it. youre waiting world vaccinate this, long wait. try forcing public, expect full blown Civil War make BLM protests look tame. Oh propaganda stinks. remember hurricane Hugo came wrecked Charlotte NC Tammy interviewed said punishment God North Carolinians treated husband prison time. gives little insight pea brain works. odd headline. Florida Godspeed. Forget Jim Bakker. Let's remember wife. universal punchline everyone many years top makeup. admit made jokes too. saw last interview Larry King 65 pounds ravaged cancer iron fortitude go live television us would fetal position hospital bed. agree religious views respect hell willpower interview.

We've road before. think riots race bad? Ha, wait till folks can't eat feed family.. yet they've already hit 5000 casualties. price herd immunity steep. Good thing food isn’t perishable anything, it’d even waste. 

Sigh. people using huge golf umbrellas one cause. Ohio opened pretty recklessly around time too, *and* biggest BLM protests country last weeks. things continue implode here, would definitely worth study. It’s scary he’s almost nothing chance, almost like knows it’s going rigged he’s going win honestly view anywhere!? else that?

Places stay closed. ""Something something Trump great...

Something something... fault...

I'm sure I'm paraphrasing somewhere... Shame Sweden bad. 1239 new cases today.

At least population sees wrong idea deal COVID-19. kind predictable tbh.. frustrating. mom housebound 3 months virus, going doctor to. going stay house longer goes people wear masks. We've eradicated (almost) viruses herd immunity, expect different. bring happens never vaccine, think fairly likely will, know situation changes calculation markedly. However, even one:

The strategy waiting vaccine interesting one, I'm convinced overall benefit it. long believe still low levels spread, vulnerable still *fairly* vulnerable (vaccines work far less well elderly younger people). this, elderly added benefit prior immunity build like flu, I'm guessing less effective flu vaccine (at least one correct flu strain).

It interesting see plays - disagree country that's able effectively wait vaccine likely see lower death rate, question much lower end. year, slightly lower death rate worth it? Maybe, maybe not, think clear cut calculus. Hit nail head. Bunch angry doomers sub. Yes That's really bad. missed great opportunity role model wearing mask potentially saving lives process. yesterday (16th)?

Its +1,827 today according Arizona correct, fact large part Covid basically killing elderly people already usually great health doesn’t really shock conscience way 100k 18-40 year old males charging trench mowed machine gun fire does.

It’s shocking still, sure understand point valid I'm trying wrap head around idea entering restaurant, let alone bar.  Makes sense, he's old. Needs protect himself. Nah, Arizona's number today 1827. number June 17 already in. 

Despite western state, Arizona reports daily numbers fairly early day (ahead many eastern states). It’s interesting said best advice slow spread stay home. open business then? bars open? dine-in restaurants? people crowding store work? airport put clarification article. 500 workers last 3 days tested, 2 came back positive. 

260 people associated airport working close contact workers tested positive since start pandemic. 132 workers wishy washy headline think haircuts thing people complaining about, clearly don’t empathy people put life’s energy building business, livelihood swept away instant, less nothing owe worth bank. 
You clearly don’t know like undocumented immigrant food insecure, clearly don’t know like health problems, lose health insurance due job loss like tens millions Americans have. clearly aren’t thinking increase amount suicides drug overdose victims happened since shutdowns, clearly aren’t thinking like asked surrender independence livelihood put trust hands corrupt, blundering, broke government looted taxpayers bail rich cronies strings attached. Yes, precisely. happens. fear mongering say happens, reality. Same. Part job onsite Bay cool WFH set-up cheaper apartment would amazing. thing already? source that? Take WHV waste money then, meant coming February 2021 thought. Stupid public health issue political. hell website? area. We’ve pretty lucky. Zero died near me. 2 whole province nursing homes.

Foreclosures? Maybe.

(I don’t wish death foreclosure anyone) currently 276 ICU beds available state. number covid patients ICU increased 76 past 24 hours.  

Given spike positive test cases, trend covid patients entering ICU going accelerate next weeks, significant lag someone tests positive bad enough shape need admitted ICU. “1 many!” great nothing sound bite! Camping really going contribute much, proven disperses outside pretty quick. Especially campsites usually least 20 feet either side site fron people. Camping probably one covid friendly activities do. somehow find restaurant sit seating way home something maybe. Still none around county green “‘Misled” “discouraged” .. say lied. lied. turn many people infected (and died) virus. Good job. **symptomatic** people were...

I read twice too, good. Yes. Conclusion: semantics (words) sometimes describe world... rewipe sink what? told family invite anyway.


Since moved here, they're little tired clean bathroom.  Covid known transmit via sweat. Covid part DNA.

Your sweat contain DNA. guarantee people protests don’t consume right-wing corporate media diet like CNN, MSNBC, Fox. Someone threw big rock pond NYC, wave traveling across country. That's waves work. NYC numbers spike again, *that's* second wave. ""We room sick dying hospital"" anything celebrate. people could learn Eskimos place elderly ice flow. much cheaper airline ticket. started 26th May, yes. (For reason commented got deleted auto mod) Whatever truth is, still don’t concur YOLO DeSantis’ thought process re: COVID19. didn’t much show up, haha, showing secured victory.

Well hornets nest also includes fact males 18-45 sent war certainly could train more.

Also given ocean us enemy, US would probably destroyed invasion fleet nazis Japanese could created long got here, would’ve ample heads anywhere near catastrophic headline might lead believe. death horrible, 4 times many Americans today 100 years ago. early say something like pandemic devastating WWI. 

I mean, true, feel also rather misleading. Moreover, clearly shows people making enough money live working full-time. Logically think fact majority people country make less 600 week working full-time... literally trading 8 hours life away every day unlivable wage (i.e. modern slavery).

This situation shows clear disconnect leadership country, white collar workers, average Americans. think mean Iran. also can't stop James Cameron James Cameron he's James Cameron. (He got granted exception come NZ film Avatar 2). decline slower European countries far (although due time-shifted spread different areas - Moscow 5K/day 1K/day, cities picking slack) New Zealand back COVID map, glad it’s American bringing them. said worldwide, talking one country. counting year’s actual stats, aren’t yet, comparing WHO’s figures 1.4 million per year typically, dividing 12 multiplying 6.5 Estimate many would normally occur time year 758,333. Covid-19 isn’t close yet.

Plus average road accident steals far days life victim Covid does, average age death 78-80. Even US’s really low motor vehicle death rate, terms living days stolen Americans, toll American life higher. 

And road deaths didn’t actually decline lot US lockdown. 8 percent. article renewed 10% DECREASE.

They initially said concessions. talked told reconsider.

My rent went $3200 $2900 3 emails going back forth accepting it.

Santa Clara, CA Correct!
Oh boy 😭 Wear mask, want live! waiting this. move later year. Hoping prices drop supposedly tactics ""how agree another x months contract $200 less per month"" That's get idiot president. Death destruction over. Sad times. Unfortunately, past point controlling like SK. Would've nice could've gotten handle first showed up. Kawasaki surname. one person/thing named Kawasaki. literally 3 outcomes beating epidemic. 

1). Possible vaccine 

2). Possible natural immunity conference massive loss life

3). change society ways interact. 

That’s it. outcome kills lot people Every year forever never goes away. Thank God already knew first announced opening. know asymptomatic people spread it, though. Anyone sub mid February knew it. CDC better sources us known well. 3,600 🙃 BLM protestors significantly outnumber lockdown protestors, even wearing masks somewhat limits virus could still end breeding ground larger number infections.

OTOH surprisingly cases linked lockdown protests despite lack masks social distancing. Since BLM protestors masked, could see opposite scenario. me? 100% agree. Found 2 bedroom bay area easily $700 undervalue. Techies moving away cities work home now. lived urban, rural America. And, found situation describe- case outside large metro area, found hold true city. Everyone know including known someone died virus. Can’t say motor vehicle deaths. Considering novel virus humans don’t know everything history draw from. Precautions made. way come go like there’s nothing really happening. Know that? Morons animals. asked would enforce it. I’m interested speculating might might pay it. 💕 think largely due supply shortage. Everyone planning sell wants wait pandemic sell. Meanwhile everyone job wanted buy still wants buy. US could put efforts supporting mask use giving incentives places make masks asap.  chose say masks required. still pushing mask required. Ah, ok. Yeah, Tampa Venice inflated. I'm sad say I'm counting prices coming next year plan buying house then. Nah fucked up. Big time. Stop making excuses them. straight lied American people resulted death massive scale. Every virus prior 1796 Edward Jenner invented first vaccine. I'm healthcare worker assigned Covid unit hospital, got tested twice. Charged $1,000 per test. That’s Iran Brazil for. don’t need multiple examples.  I'm aware, think lot people understand would mean truly protect nursing homes. message everyone ""stay home"", nursing homes means ""stay inside one room"". apply logic schools, churches, bars, etc., can't see extends setting like nursing home. Stupid stupid work gym members come aren’t required workout mask. quit job? 5 years basically I’m supposed clean whole time. anyone gets corona, wouldn’t me? signed legal document bought car said that, that's fault signing agreement. see, game. facts comment.

Health Experts: “Even things shut down, it’ll late. We’ll see numbers keep getting worse get better. That’s virus behaves.” Yeah is. I've done both. Back kids work demanding, myself. I've using property manager last 10 years so. Worth every penny get good one. time hospitals full, already 2 weeks - 1 month behind mitigation could help. pandemic requires people think consequences month out, sadly Americans equipped anymore. someone drank aquarium cleaner thought stuff it. Goodbye  means end massive sprawling suburbs around current urban areas, I'm scared. means small cities get bit bigger, I'm okay that. really despise people buy nice 40 acre farm middle nowhere split 10 small-ish suburban lots. like pinnacle American excess.

It seems likely hospital systems states early reopenings pushed limits within weeks. want argue strawmen arguments now? 

Like said, really scraping barrell. Useless without testing numbers deaths slow declining trend. Nobody saying strategy good spread clearly slowing

Find something shows testing positivity number tests done hospitalizations going something. Otherwise banging head wall talking new cases guys opened everything back up? seems nuts stage Worst case scenario Congress bail Alabama cash hire doctors would end it. see NYC-like peak anyway thanks much lower density.

He fraud I'm sure possible someone get food coronavirus, unusual coronavirus can't multiply food surface. I’ve seen times New York. often coughing, see people pulling noses masks letting masks dangle freely one ear like window blowing lazily breeze.

Many people, even here, barely clear minimal threshold compliance. I’ve listened lot folks whinge even non-effort they’ve demonstrated, society’s audacity forcing care others.

I’m convinced mask etiquette shining UV light motel bedsheets country, letting useless cumstains among us shine brightly see. (X) Doubt  every country success like Vietnam New Zealand call governments heads would real compentcy would viewed reaction. world needs failures see victory others. We're fucked wait out. point we're good 6 months another year. I've telling awhile, make June 2021. Nothing's certain I'm hoping vaccine then. Also, keep mind historically people endure hardships much longer far virus. Blitz Britain WWII 8 months war lasted 5 years. vaccine 18 months, that's bad comparatively. Keep protesting stupid fucks! America saw Brazil bad felt threatened Brazil might overtake US. Cause Murica needs number 1 baby! valid consideration. it’s important note economic fallout would happen even without shutdowns anywhere. people’s confidence public places/services/industries go down, economy suffers.

It’s also important see many comments lamenting Florida’s terrible state mask usage social distancing. things reasonably done without massive shutdowns.

You’re intentionally inciting controversy pinpointing one narrow branch telling people doesn’t matter. know states parts Arizona, somehow throughout city's still putting Trump stuff everywhere. Still following says wisdom truth. Still pissed potentially ""forced"" wear masks, go church things would help keep everyone alive (or keep suffering severe, potentially permanent complications even ""recovery""). 

I hate political many people... want people get horribly sick potentially die? American style disaster movie, let's face cliche. missed 12 easy payments $999.99 part. Nah. five eyes. Deaths readjusted previous month. Actual death day near 300. Well, might true, consider long china denied it. China might handled worst. mean Trump forcing approval it’s actually ready say created vaccine time elections? Toi fan Aldo est murders US Honduras Salvador combine.

This true, kind presentation suggests Honduras Salvador much safer US, untrue, due huge population differences.

Usually, say one order compare figures, compare ""all thing equals"". population important make deductions facts cocksuckers  Oh man, sorry loss. It’s unsettling people treating right like it’s big deal. Thanks response! Uh 1 far got it. Basically, stops saved thousands shore. single ones tossed chance saved. 


That basic ideal live life: positively impacting one life time. one important say less important other. 

But, look shore see large 4x4 making way directly star fish. good number meandering path absolutely die. prioritize know path 4x4, saying lives special important? saw woman little week ago wearing mask NOSE. Like, wrapped band covered nose.

It really dumb. nyc, we've hit hard, still people ridiculous. I've seen strangers wearing masks take masks conversation tired wearing masks. truly incomprehensible. EU said tariffs US say Germany dumping cars US? problem we’re facing Montgomery is, get city councilman actually listen experts? Iowa, that’s 478 day. countries seem unlikely get control USA, Brazil, Russia India... leaves world pretty ok GOP supports local control....until don't. everything. 10%? county reassess every year increase 10%? county? way that's Midwest, would shocked. 

Gotta city location? drink much corona? humans? follow rules? what? leave food entirely pay never increases even management. running 3 stores 11 dollars hour 55 hours week I'm pretty sure creeps hoarded toilet paper CDC would upfront mask information. literally proved can't trusted. antibody tests high false positive rate.

Edit- sure I'm downvoted? antibody tests reliable, especially took April ""wild wild west"" phase test allowed FDA regardless specificity sensitivity. Keep us updated they’re info think infected feel comfortable sharing. Hope recover quickly! quote Isiah God creating moral, unethical evil. 

When dismiss that? said opinion. Thanks sharing it. read Hebrew? Like, globally? Probably.

US only? Doubt it. We’ll probably see small drop people considering leaving city depart less people actively move in. virus gone sooner rather later, don’t we’ll see cultural shift something that’s likely going short-term event. Something worst doesnt justify something that's bad. know now. dont know personally, disappointed you. Ugh, sucks. Please stay safe thanks response! nut bags mainly. NZ could population trusts government science. US put tariff German cars dumping? No, US want protect industry. oversight deliberate action. Unfortunately there's good way deal put counter tariff, countries nowadays. don’t forget request payments Sunday won’t get money!! Glad got paid, hell waiting check time Everything going New York state fascinating me. things continue open slowly, cases deaths continue fall rapid pace. 17 deaths day compared 800 one point staggering. almost makes optimistic ""second wave"" seems real effect reopening. would say warmer weather might making impact southern states guess would prove wrong? honestly feels like herd immunity me. Obviously would way optimistic think way I'm fighting thoughts almost makes feel like everybody susceptible large percentage population could caught New York State already gotten it. knows though. probably younger vets get healthcare jobs. Also believe VA would better using medicare medicade. Also might young vets never think anything wrong never go hospital often. Yes people would attend would refuse wear mask mock did. Masks massive factor spread containment happen are? happen? don’t think that’s norm. They're still called doomers. one reads sub anymore, there's single Coronavirus post /r/all. Positive cases going move needle. 

Maybe deaths will, 1000 deaths week. Granted, probably record pneumonia deaths, government knows deflect that. wrong, mentioned article, presenting either-or proposition false dichotomy. gotta reopen even faster... looks article, look like first test. symptoms later positive antibody test (which really high false positive rate, especially time took virus widespread). also claims infected Dallas, Texas February, zero documented cases community spread would two weeks first presumed positive, mention travel China Europe. find doubtful first time around. person symptoms too... 18,000 new cases yesterday, 27,000 cases today. seeing 50% day day bump... +1 million cases per day weeks. entire planet month. really bad mood swings depo provera. Anything gets hormones whack seems make crazy. know. take steroids temporarily deal long term able deal Well people could worn masks anyway safe. article basically useless point.   

Could start using vaccine phase 3 completed, based antibody testing?  Sure, especially things get bad phase 3 complete. limit phase 3 completion seems enough folks infected test cohort infection rate low takes long time. infection rate low, vaccine needed (or people class location affected high rate need added cohort).  

So SHTF give particularly endangered folks like seniors health care providers, provided safety issues shown up. quickly get sex change operation maybe Biden consider VP. Since Biden's bigoted ass made clear men need apply. feel like ask thing. apartment said they're opening pool entire summer year, despite several places opening theirs. fine time think amenities factored price rent somewhat, get discount know! It’s crazy divided everyone pandemic. I’m saying still need locked house, could &amp; still treat pandemic precautions need too. Thanks response. Online government trolls want friendly chat soon... Yeah, unfortunately many political leaders country modeling stupidity, idiots use example supposed act. anyone expect people smart leader would inject bleach wearing mask beyond me. comment downvotes true  ""96% Upvoted"" accept reality. Tell shove shots butte. Uh seen nursing homes US? cant manage basic hygiene safety. Cases started decreasing result shutdowns? saying nominated based UBI, single-issue. sarcastic, mean say violating constitutional rights? Reason ask. Respiratory Therapist living Montgomery Al mask ordinance voted recently 5 4. One councilman (Brantley Lyons) also attorney used claim part reasoning informed PULMONOLOGIST.

Can’t believe endure thing many careless people. guys going guarantee quarantine lasts long possible. can't understand mentality populace toward guy--like he's kind sage 

I love relying clickbait headlines trying smear cannot change opinion swedes (that actually speak Swedish know propaganda) try smear well ""oh see like sage!"" takes around 3 weeks die another five days count death statistics. 


Even conservative basis, it’s going take least 3 weeks. Three weeks ago Florida averaging 400-600 cases/day. it’s 5-6 times many. 

So, yeah... right.  Yes, wear mask. Remember formula:

Successful infection = Exposure Virus x Time

Here good, straight forward reading Yes, Portland many listings pay put application ever talking anyone. feel like always driven towards less conventional rental situations suffering credit makes good rental history near impossible.

I realized week lived alone decade, lived one stable, consistent, place longer year two decades.

I'm fucking exhausted home. insane. US Americans died home died fighting WW1. Holy Shit. multi-trillion bailout rich trickle-down... Perfectly good 2-bedroom homes FL going $100k. It’s insane. Watched one neighbors put body bag yesterday lawn. Houses coming everywhere lot dark reasons. really common current long term renters pay new tenant. want bring new people let pay less first lease, increase substantially course next couple. Every apartment I've rented, first year, cost hundreds month move-in offers.  Well, honestly, thinking everyone White House little penises - even women - pretty funny. Thanks look recently, cases freefalled even testing increases. Mask usage good, could better. Goes show reopening isn’t really death sentence people think is. Thanks part wearing mask outside around others. everyone wore masks maintained distance others we’d able confidently open things save businesses. Everything right buying time saving many lives possible waiting treatments vaccine. Wearing mask helping slow spread believe patriotic selfless thing right now. Agreed. people Chicago even claim deep dish pizza? stuff closer lasagna pizza. costs go up? surely raise point? Alternate: Demand side economics theory bolstered poor spending rich decide hoard wealth. Oh wow. know feeling anxious. Please stay safe away people best can. Thanks response! large reason lost. Please educate stop spreading rumors false information. Goodbye Nonsense, pandemic Ba Sing Se! gtfo maga boy  I'm renter. deal trash, water, gas, electric, sewer taxes, garbage, maintenance repair appliances, landscaping planting, sweeping blow-vac'ing driveway, paid-up property annual real estate taxes range $300. landlord incurs risk every expense incurred, simply raises rent cover whatever loan took out. justifies telling retirement.

That's talking though. person replied said one would rent could own, absolutely false. 


And top would even recommend people start looking homes/employment outside large cities. lot smaller communities affordable homes, lots job opportunities, low cost living. ""Immigrants get shittiest jobs""

Wow calm racist Fear virus spreading trick well lockdown not... would see significant increases infections vulnerable people. We're certainly seeing increased infections. 

The thing is, earlier big daily death totals due mostly NY. Future ones spread geographically, takes 1000+ daily deaths go 50 day 20 states. there's several states could see 75-100 deaths daily without much stretch.

It take awhile ramp back up, *that* long people stupid. incorrect concept fails take account everyone else around them.

If entire country 30 sure, logic actually makes sense. not. thought ""herd immunity"" never part strategy complain? /s    Brian! coulda introduced man I’m friendly care public health ramifications.

Made bed, fun! definitely go time prepping. smart school prepping three scenarios:

1. Full time school following strict guidelines
2. Full time virtual learning
3. Hybrid virtual/in school learning reduce total number students school given time.

The fall going tough schools. possible, might helpful state speculation like medical fact. people read think true. work dpw, confirm nobody gives fuck think people turn televangelists feel superior others. think turn televangelists frightened desperate know else turn.

Sure, many might watch Bakker validates bigotry whatever, people donate big money usually trying save others.

Someone life got pulled tele scam sick believe doctors could help (and right that, incurable lived poor area doctors naked dislike patient population bothered make decent effort treat. gone now, still think every day. digress.)

And that's people like Bakker always hawking Coronavirus cures warning next apocalypse; want scared, want feel helpless, want give money protection. 

I think distinction important think people give money Bakker feel superior, kind deserve happens them. see many victims exploited, less likely OK behavior.

In way Bakker ilk symptom, disease. flourish people vulnerable exploitation, vulnerable society failed them. improve society strip power people like Jim Bakker. Wow thank thorough illuminating response. 'dictator' resembles Joffrey Baratheon. bragging much testing doing

But that's misleading U.S. testing inadequate positivity basis. See throwing shade China countries stopped testing

China stopped testing. countries stopped testing? true testing little suddenly problem

Who says countries problem stopped testing? Odd legitimate basis Trump's statement, claim people misrepresenting. Exactly. political message lobbying groups suppressing new regulations added cost businesses already depressed revenue(mostly). actual police there. takes special kind immortality lack human decency risk people’s lives order line pockets. Houston fertility institute employee test positive covid week. Still officially told patients let alone close It’s happened major tourist cities US. know Nashville, New Orleans, Austin housing markets fucked *hard* investors realized could rent tiny units bachelor/ette parties every single weekend make would renting regular families. think Sweden advantages flattened curve. live alone, work home, culture socially distant western countries, high level trust government, leading people compliant governments suggestions 

At time level individual caution also works cross purposes trying rush ""herd immunity."" goal government spray corona airplanes country people deal it. Organized religion joke. almost cases people run eventually diverge significantly actual teachings Messiah. It’s virtually inevitable human beings corrupt greedy. Best avoid organized religion like plague. means believe whatever want support organized religion always wind evil. How? common sense, every state increased testing backed thing like live in. Reality!  Yup. Got downvoted mentioning fact observation entirely anecdotal, lol. Good them! Saving lives making money tourists akin ""astronaut food."" Everything powdered: eggs, butter, potatoes, milk, honey etc

Depending kind natural disasters area prone to, bad little sort thing hand, would buy reputable company, Jim Bakker. Scores people already died virus, still waiting millions deaths lockdown. Furthermore, health community dependent health economy vice versa, government worried maintaining economy's health, government investing social programs address poverty, homelessness, medical bills, shit mentioned. systematic issue present us decades, virus made obvious. Brace doomers like: ""But second wave ! wait 2 weeks...""  both.

Because figure fire caused grease, using water going burn house hurry. Selfish = stupid. mean... it’s view, it’s fact I’m American. U.S. done shit. led shutdown least partially to, oversight lead yourself. Ya, would welcoming side effect. That's get asking simple direct cut dried question. Muh racisms. 2020 1920, spend money home problem texas' tests gone past week. monolith still NATIONAL RESPONSE. can't blanket say rises testing unless ignore shit ton data. indoors long time talking, probably safe distance. See Washington choir. kept six feet apart 90% attendance infected single person. actually work. They're gimmick. friends mine made tool risk covid. amount shit delete, ban run marketing campaigns people saying bs, government propaganda not. Like bro, made help people out. Wtf think hit 1M vaccines coming, overall decline US deaths due initial lockdown NY tri state area getting shit control. trend continue rest states reopening. [Two weeks said reading news felt like March again. headlines starting feel like early April again. I'm fucking stupid I'm concerned virus kills almost one demographic?

ICU capacity gone 82% 80% yesterday 83% today, that's worrisome. Hopefully remains around low-mid 80's see hitting 90's soon.  

I still agree anyone saying ""AZ next NY"" low population density essentially zero public transit.

For new cases 10.3% positive.

FTFY! Yeah wouldn’t call that, don’t interact anyone party came attend. Given fucked Kansas almost understand that. talking washington DC. thought really obvious, guess not. fun. reality check: 25,000 new cases yesterday US. sorry fucking stupid opinion. denying science making bullshit. Fuck putting people danger selfish prick. friend's snapchat (more like acquaintance honestly) posted snap partying packed bar Phoenix.

This virus may deadly towards elderly, people can't forget naive teenagers young adults World around them. mask also makes difficult overbreathe, many, many people do, even rest. Check Buteyko breathing want get nitty gritty that's terrible thing. 

Some people made pretty woo woo claims benefits, turned off, tried anyway, made huge difference heart rate, blood pressure, mood. crazy much breath affect you. I’d sure hope ... definitely defeats purpose. 

There dumb tourists travel transport necessary internal function

Transport, sure, goods disinfected. Travel, much, adapt virtual meetings etc. Essential long-stay travellers quarantined. I'm expert this, international travel might essential? 

I agree everything else. Lockdown Thailand heavily enforced, everyone cooperated effectively seems worked. see getting downvoted, that's typical fat-neckbeard reddit behaviour.

To answer question people fucking selfish. wants important peoples lives. Welcome human race, suck. us, us. I'm moving today. building. Rent went almost $50/month - moving bigger unit, privacy balcony, upgraded appliances, extra parking spot. definitely time move able. threaten move see they'll drop renewal market rating. ""FUUCK? MMMH"" Coronavirus, deciding add ""sexually trasmitted disease"" resume $70k/year individuals households? Portland isn’t even first choice, it’s top list comes housing affordability. I’d move San Diego heartbeat made another $25k net income. Ditto - think people get little ""OPEN STATE NOW"", States started show people shit ain't over, better wear mask able sit outside, ignore forms common sense right back - plus density residents high, especially North NJ. Ditto. made stop really think, fact entire sales team working home, past couple months. That's 10 people, traveling nearly every week, averaging $3-$6k expenses week. $40k+ spending airlines, food, hotels every week gone. agree said. I've clear agree it. sure understand that. 

I'm sorry issues. experiences everyone's experiences though. local area population around 100,000, starter homes city available around $100k. Even less look rural communities. moderate income (~30k/year) half decent credit opportunities available. San Marcos bad Oct last year, Unfortunately laid April. Almost bought house too. This, right there. image everything things go bad there, happens Vegas stay Vegas. Everyone hear Vegas brand goes down. post bit long, tl;dr Canada's response alright, lot room improvement.

It kind depends province health authorities organized. provinces local health organizations communication well organized others centralized provincial government. funding generally flows provincial purse organizational structure. upper levels nearly much knowledge situation individual facilities might think - processes ongoing reporting service utilization example, year-end quarterly numbers.

In general, normal times, local organizations set objectives priorities apply higher levels funding proposals. crisis upended process name expediency response. province, health ministry took lead COVID file frequent cross-organizational meetings coordinate responses individual regions. allowed build processes things like on-going reporting fly, coordinating equipment PPE purchases provincially eventually nationally.

However, think lot made response cohesive health regions looking operate profitably, instead looking provide adequate service levels clients. quickly realized need enhance service expand resources virus spread, resources allocated money spent needed (and - panicked decisions early days!). Since source funding government, funds raised borrowing reallocating funding areas no-longer operating pandemic (parks, non-essential government departments, etc.).

There also obvious failures. biggest long term care sector, especially ~~Eastern~~ Central Canada (E: I'm Western Canada, ""east"" here!). Interestingly, privatized section healthcare system. Workers frequently poorly trained paid, work part-time keep benefit costs down, therefore end working multiple facilities. one major cause quick spread disease vulnerable population responsible majority serious illness death Canada.

Another obvious failure acquisition, stockpiling, maintenance PPE supplies. swine flu, government built massive national stockpile PPE preparation future pandemic. Unfortunately, stockpile never properly maintained, less year ago, much destroyed past shelf life never replaced. left front-line workers nationwide precarious access proper PPE weeks, issue still totally resolved.

The LTC debacle already triggered multiple inquests, expect PPE situation also end looking government commission. Sometimes result lasting positive change, sometimes don't. almost always end public report allows voters accountability.  Plus generally poor, uneducated terrible health infrastructure. They're pretty much third world country. that’s like saying people choice spit people public  Slowly got back 2 months landlord offered three months half rent three-bedroom signing another year helped ton  expect ""conflict"" Iran next months, well, give chance rattle sabre. mean, that’s already happening extent New York. people figured work home they’re upstate, back living Mom &amp; Dad New Jersey, you’re stuck home anyway, pay NYC prices that?

A friend mine went Long Island help elderly parents started March. She’s still seriously starting think makes sense go back city this, especially she’s going spending lot time folks next several years. Mine increase offered random home improvements sign stay another year. Kind nice, I'm thinking it.  now! bought house price st Louis. 60 people looking 2 days, 10 offers day 3, got offered 20K asking. Must due great economy bouncing back /s speak nursing homes daily testing. It’s honestly shameful (and imo criminal) ignorant are. 

Here’s typical convo:

-yes month ago, didn’t cases state isn’t mandating we’re good go
“So don’t think may wise retest perpetually ensure one recently sick?”
-no, we’re opening back visitors everything good far
“Umm.. ok guess”

*I should’ve also mentioned, testing someone symptomatic* What's big igloo freak? Right. lost deleted emails torturing molesting children. Thank Yeah don’t know not, I’m sure would need voted raising taxes isn’t exactly popular platform. think tax increases come reassessments we’ve seen happen area recently, regularly. 

People still need places live don’t think home values skyrocketing right worried reassessment. remember reading mayor Nashville somewhere warning property taxes could increased hundreds percent keep city afloat, think desperate move city economically hit hard covid. 

I’m particularly worried mil rates going area. remember affects home owners landlords. Maybe small crash - it’s SF. lived internet boom bust early 2000s. 

The house prices purchase went super short moment. Investors snatch cash offers. 

Rent stayed pretty much same. Small amount housing, large amount people wanting get in. Test positive rate want see whenever see change like this. go wrong?


I wish knew. sad time country. someone's protest coughs spreads virus child child takes home spreads grandpa... that's justified BLM protest? 

I'm confused reasoning this. foreign born  ""I'm seeing rents 10% 20%, higher-end luxury units taking biggest hits,"" said Dave Chesnosky, agent Compass San Francisco. ""But drops dependent location uniqueness unit.""

I'm saying article Bullshit. BULLSHIT! Yes should. free people Great explanation!

I think many situations extrapolate ""positivity rate"" ""percentage infections missing"". However extrapolation probably varies place place, also time (as kill flu, larger percentage people flu symptoms test positive COVID). example, positivity rate, we're guessing missing percentage infections weeks - course means we're missing total infections.

I agree 9 cases - make 3x3 table. outrageous inflation accounted for. extreme time range, house sold $250k 1990 would 500k today. would argue even better deal compare interest rates 90's. course say salaries kept pace, cases true. Kinda funny since ya argued point made it. 🤷🏽‍♂️ want think like fine. know many others life already starting improve get back normal. people don't. online news. side note, local airport (small, Portland, Me) yesterday getting rental car short one way. Walked baggage claim ticket counters, saw 3 (THREEE) people total. really thought much ghost town there.  Maybe stories people coming cv visiting bars Florida coming thin air.

It's understanding currently enforced policies Florida relating coronavirus, suggested guidelines. I'm wrong, please help add missing nuance showing me. rules sub titles allowed altered Japanese guy’s pandemic Yeah exercise free will.

However gym reopen last week wife showed website said going require masks ask limit workout one hour. also way schedule time website.

So went night masks agreed either us needed stop cause mask, could leave. figured “well least trying commit safer environment.”

Holy shit me, wife one guy ONES committing wearing mask. least half mask chin, pocket, wrists, hanging ears.

Here am, ~ 240 chunky person running treadmill sweating literal face mask big muscle meathead dudes able handle wearing mask?! gonna go gym interest bettering body yet ignore global health risk blatantly?

I’m fucking pissed it’s stated require masks aren’t actually enforcing it.

I don’t get people think virus gone away... really want go gym god gym community backwards comes issue (I’m California, too...) watched many major protests live streaming people wearing masks, don’t know tell you. main people weren’t wearing masks cops. protest? noticed even SC friend went protest (he sent Snapchat video crowd), people generally wearing masks. remember every picture see friends, one wearing them!

I've unsuccessfully trying buy home small towns year. simple living city either. want pick choose whose life important, reaching point here.

in rest world pick parameters like life expectancy, age, conditions chose lives die, surprised u.s. parameter pick reliable insurance company have. ""they pay 99% times quickly, gets priority"" ""but 95 already wheelchair, guy 28 healthy, baby"" ""yeah unemployed, insurance, give bed grandpa"" I’m metro Detroit paying $1,150 rent 650 sq ft 1 bed 1 bath condo. downriver something? seems incredibly cheap “nice” neighborhood around here. I've never heard 7 year budget cycle. Longest think government 2 years almost always 1 year place I've ever known, US. Use isopropyl alcohol instead bleach sanitize US paper bills. checked Bay area prices this. change well. There's way much demand markets. aware Finland living Sweden-level restrictions since 1.6? Everything open, everything crowded, one gives shit corona anymore. Yet dying out, single death three days, we're ~5 new infections/day. Neither school reopening 14.5, reopening restaurants 1.6 noticeable effect all. never full lockdown first place, course, mostly recommendations like Sweden.

Yes Sweden much worse, point attributing looser restrictions disingenious. neighbors even looser restrictions, yet merest hint infection spike. think we’ve hit point people can’t mentally comprehend death rate. 

I'm point, less can't comprehend point there's literally nothing do. country decided course wants, I'm going hunker hold fast long hope one like dies. Here's [United's policy like require facemasks reduced seating policy, expected. mention ""try"" manage flight ""not sitting next passengers"" largely means nothing follow that.

They also temperature checks implemented airports.

Personally, I'm sure I'd feel good traveling based that. misleading. 
Here clarification Orlando International Airport: 
 Great time buy right now. Interest rates low really leverage seller terms they’re likely desperate. said also horrible time sell reasons I’ve listed above. talking quote. made response, dismissed it. Pretty straight forward me. know. 2 weeks. seen single example i've following closely. “At price” reality even close 30% daily increase infections time NYC. March testing exponentially increasing almost non existent. made curve positive cases look like went 100 cases/day 10,000 cases/day two weeks. But, reflect actual viral transmission, mostly NY finally starting test. curve slowly increasing, undetected weeks/months then. No, viable path preemptively cull herd like Sweden. There’s possible progress treatment could help later: and? tell us they’re short supply atm improvise scarf bandana like ppl whole thing.

Oh yeah cause people rational trough this. Surely Arnold even go gym one house. commend mentioning elephant soon entering room. really hope WFH embraced larger scale ability reduce vehicle emissions. Unfortunately, old guard already trying bring everyone back office without plan logistics place. rest world going control there's vaccine approach mean prolonged recession. nz approach successful fully functioning domestic economy everyone else still social distancing scared go outside.

These last couple weeks hospitality industry never busy, ski fields recorded busiest opening weekend record. That’s kids school pre pandemic. elementary ate gymnasium floor rest school. gross. finally got rid corona place emphasis ""*all*""? strange. understand messages mixed, surely people common sense. seems obvious covering nose mouth could help? even doesn't, what's downside? Absolutely!!!  San Diego.. ICE selling detainees organized crime country they're fleeing from? celebrities made bigger deal mask could make progress. I'm really disappointed rap community. wanted help black people PSAs mask. landlord fail renew lease agreement reason, unless landlord illegally retaliates

Add top this, feds trying bake immunity businesses lawsuits contracting Covid aid/stimulus package. Even if/when people ready stand up, avenues redress may already closed off. Yes, bad indeed! paid fee see rental? normal? I've never paid application fee I've viewed place.  refuse even acknowledge political.

You either put mask, smart.
You either reject wearing mask, stupid 

This politics. reporting given day deaths curve shows slow steady decline

It's little contradictory regular steady decline time. would say slow unsteady decline.    
At least, compared countries (even UK pronounced falling curve) Wonder control fact Belgium counted differently countries. understand it, counted excess deaths COVID deaths. permanent resident family outside Australia, can't tell much support decision. need spikes. tough fuck year us need make compromises. That's pretty good realistic sense. US embraced mask policy get-go January 2/3 population wearing masks, would've much better position. Obviously, I'd prefer 100%. that's idealistic rather practical.

If go Asian countries Covid19 infection rates low, wearing mask 100%. Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, etc. Especially, considering warm weather, people like wear masks many don't. Luckily, majority still wears it. No, not. simply stupid. controlled opening allowing people return work done mitigating risk. Packing thousands shoulder shoulder shouting screaming conducive mitigation, full stop. Please understand comment absurdly stupid. Adding fact black urban community risk protests, takes stupidity of.your post another level. Thanks explanation. sounds like Spain regions actually power US states. Fort Wayne Indiana! Maryland. That's true, arent. That's tax increases people 75% 95% range happen lot often tax increases top: many Americans see people make *any* amount money enemy ultra-rich realize pitting 75% bottom 75% easy do. Alternative headline: rich get way blowing money carelessly crisis It’s fine it’s increased testing! 

/s Anybody denies lockdowns don’t lead job loss delusional idiot. Anybody believes locking wearing masks there’s exponential spread virus ICU/ hospital bed availability won’t also lead job loss also delusional idiot. always someone poor you. Maybe give money away rather telling people money. police instigated violence. That's good know! 4,400 new cases Texas yesterday. 

That's worrying about. sure 9 people downvoted damn California live 500 month would make someone's dreams come true. Good. never high begin with. It’s bluer state. [You say [Full CDC guidelines blocked weeks limited, heard United pretty strict  Every day swear lose faith humanity didn’t even know left...my fuckin god idiot 

Also really careful, she’s pretty overweight likelihood COVID-19 would good time people right top yelling people's faces without masks on. It’s crazy virus causing outbreak close Article Circle. Sweden prevent this? Yup, likely. tests (if any) false negatives. amount incivility post sickening. Swedish excess deaths probably attributed COVID 1k piece written: probably higher now. three people isolate there's vaccine.

The temporary inconvenience needed, good many.

""We gotta serve Martinis, nails, go mall."" - way, talk incredibly patronizing dismissive. Socializing, looking good, experiencing new things, among things make life worth living - existing living. Yes become increasingly obvious lately. Agreed. Texas every year. Usually 10%. Office staff... Disagree that. many software developers West Virginia? People in-demand skills moved cities. It’s like legions knowledge workers Arkansas settle food service jobs Facebook Google didn’t office area. Tech workers continue command premium salaries skills valuable. need go back half much theyre remotely touchable lease expires May think resigned mine February. wasn’t really expecting virus fuck economy hard.

So mine went 15 dollars 😒 Eastern Standard Time. Sorry confusion. panic influence thc bad extrem situations... still don’t get people desperately need eat restaurant. I’m happy picking food, put open like pandemic happening around you?

We watching youtubers go restaurant California. place packed outside grassy area circles drawn ground showing kids designated spots could play. one single kid playing circles. one hd masks table 6ft apart, outside that, everyone standing right next other. last people gym right now. mask potentially dangerous that's good sign high risk. Millions* There’s still breathing room left, ICU full, they’ll triage general wings. general wing full, they’ll triage take, don’t admit people mild symptoms. 

Except going on, medical professionals exposed higher higher viral loads increases severity.  causes resource constraints hospitals, even try clear beds number people service beds drops. literally one saying that. Canada, that's part made response orderly, understand. health authorities look hospitals region, designate certain hospitals certain responses move equipment resources. 

Instead separate entities, available resources within system. ""If attack money changers turn page 327. ignore turn page 56""

(I dont issue money changers general, heathen little recollection bible stories youth recall bit least) 4th leave ministates... guess it’s backwards. apartment gave letter sixty day move notice couple days let know. Unfortunately, wasn’t even there... let know 56 days instead 60. Shits going cost 127! Yes, I’m salty it. get downvoted every time mention it. It’s wild.
 
Covid isn’t binary. It’s “You either die, you’re completely fine.” purpose though? Oh yeah, apartment raised rent another $110... raising $120 six month ago.

how chaz hurting everyone? I'm upset makes sense. COVID go walk around neighborhood 5000 per month college apartment steal? Fuck that. ask part Florida in? east stockton? US flights exactly caring much Coronavirus restrictions, flight back would ok, flight would probably sardine can.

I'm inter-province flight they've blocked aisle seats they're seating 1 person per row smaller plane. Masks required, temp checks airport. That's safe flying get. agree. best friend makes $70k shared apartment $1800 doable, would want. Aside first treatment discovered yesterday many need discovered live without vaccine guys think ? would like five/six right ? Jesus, God made flesh.

The biggest opinion all.

I get Christianity. faiths/perspectives. know that?

Anyway, talking Tanakh. whatever personally deem authoritative. Lmfao win stupid prizes ya idiots. Proud No.1 worst country yet? nearly total. stop lying, stop ableist piece shit. bunch old people wearing masks, crowding indoors. Wcgw?? interest making meaningless predictions happen month now. beds filled covid patients patients waiting beds become available non-covid patients? international airport ? hmmmm don’t live here...

Nevada media playing virus protests Las Vegas. Coverage far between. 

The media PR machine casino industry. largest newspaper owned Sheldon Adelson , guy owns Venetian/Palazzo Sands Expo Center. dismally weak coverage been, it’s still better local news stations. 

Governor Steve Sisolak moved casino reopening “phase 3 4” phase 2. Even numerous reports videos unmasked tourists crowding casinos night night, he’s still careful pointing finger casinos mentioned address day largest daily increase (the day numbers reported public). assigned casino executive head task force left reopening plan casinos Gaming Control Board (notoriously full doctors /s). 

Las Vegas, probably Reno, casino hospitality workers put risk every day would mitigate would make masks mandatory. won’t right common tourist someone either thinks COVID hoax greatly exaggerated god knows don’t want upset tourists. (I know serve restaurant downtown.)

Eat, drink, merry, tomorrow die. guess. already has, high end. 

Rich old people starting realize rich young people could afford $2-$3 million dollar house. bought 90s 2000s $2 $3 million realizing sell $1ish million. 

Meanwhile upper middle end housing market, prices continue increase. 90s/2000s could get house upper middle class neighborhood $250-$500k. houses $500-$750k much demand them. goes mask wearing parts world? damn frustrating U.S. see people opposed idea wearing something simple; especially tactic works. Donald Trump would proud right now.

Like seriously probably would. cases US 600k one day. 

This horrible. still uncertainty much children spread virus? parked playground parking lot minute read email got little girl 6 7 opens car door, crying saying lost. felt bad panicked slammed car door shut didnt mask on. expect child randomly open car door. get help luckily father grabbed right after. seconds could gotten her? I'm Italian working Austria moment... People give weird looks walking around mask, nobody wears one, even work, public workers waiters.

I can't help though, travel work I'm kinda dangerous, I've got take precautions.  I'm shocked allowed happen. Canada, big problem snowbirds/tourists repatriated breaking quarantine. issues Americans lying Border Guards get sneaking across border. Hello Mr. Schwarzenegger!!

I've huge fan since 4 testing way behind, correct. look 7 day rolling averages deaths single days, days report deaths deaths single digits.

April 24: 108 avg deaths

May 7: 65 avg deaths

June 16: 32 avg deaths Common sense, tells interfering normal breathing patterns healthy. like dont need doctor tell put bag head

Ferrus i'm sure long alive worn mask entire life.

All know friends family went lot concerts, music carnivals, movies, trips etc never worn masks 

I work 60 plus hours week vulnerable years

And guess what, insurance premiums went blood test revealed health excellent.


Get masks anything shirt. Top Shirts stack. actually not, body right now. California hotspots reasons they're exploding states, homogeneous think. mean even says test God like Bible doctor buddy mine sent documentation NYS DOH showing patients infectious 9 days regardless long test positive - even 6 suggesting stated capacity lowest threat level know people admitted hospital need stay occupy bed? interested, DeSantis gave good presentation yesterday goes increase cases detail discusses state testing.

I'm going go stats, testing increased significantly. median age positive test results fallen Florida 65.5 37.

You're simply going see projected increase think going happen. I'm admittedly oversensitive. Guess I'm sick lumped types stooges talking about. 

The people think sort action hero definitely delusional. So, please forgive misinterpreting intent. would liken Tidal Wave then. TSA precheck line usually short, sign minimize problem. like it, feel free browse elsewhere rather complaining.

Your vote registered arrows. get say anyone else. handle situations ~~people~~ Karen. don’t throw tantrum. don’t like it, leave. 

This exactly what, “the customer always right” means. Customers vote dollar, screeching employees zero control policy. 

Also, article says didn’t say he’ll never back. I've though must gain financial freedom. LOL don’t fucking know that. comment perfect representation sub. Absolutely ridiculous statement. Even context that's dumb First, false positive % reflect false cases random population. misshandled sample would false positive random population likely happen someone infected. Also false negatives going way. 

But really arguing treat false positives face value, make current situation look worse. May 4th 20k tests 600 cases: 2% false, means 200 real cases. Yesterday 30k tests 2700 cases, meaning 2100 real cases. Meaning that's 10x increase! that, they've tested 1.4m w/ 80k positive 12k hospitalizations. subtract 28k ""false positives"", that's 25% hospitalization rate. makes numbers look worse, better. Yes deaths down. Wondering people's thoughts case? Zombocalypse. contingency plan? I’m thinking holding Costco  one around I'm eating aside person came maybe friend also quarantining care. “There’s rule protocol requires restaurants report positive test, either state social media. Further, nothing says restaurant shut clean.”

There’s bunch articles lately scary bit. We’re hearing handfuls voluntarily closed closed customers went public happens employees got time 🙄. many people exposed contracting shutting many places suppose going around aren’t saying anything it? author concluded indoor transmission possible. Doesn’t say anything indoor transmission likely outdoor transmission. Also studies based handful case reports China sample size location make study questionable. 

Do better study? Yes. difference deaths happened. NYS big, fast spike knew less virus. southern states eventually high death rate, longer period time, know better. Margins thin, buffers tight, contracts signed. Dropping efficiency provides competitors killer advantage. wtf danishes grow farms? also fuck mink farming, wish sick small business ferrets them... grrrr Lololololololol tool 4 year old wear one without complaining (on chance actually go somewhere me)... GROWN ADULTS can, too! think response closer truth people want ""superior dicks"". lack reasonable thinking. Inability analyze people used fear paralyzed brain. 

I think using religion tool without tool back anything else religion would able make claim. “The reason mitigation protect hospital system.” - DeSantis close wikipedia post defining behavior read. context questioned spike number cases, said due increased testing. made statement.

&amp;#x200B;

 use steroids wisely, one hell de-aging drug. personally ask doctor I'm 40s/50s science said years testosterone begins drop. Whoa...mind blown broke even too, even going month month since we’re anticipating job relocation somewhat soon.  players don’t play. they’re allowed choose go don’t want to. 
that said, they’re taking insane precaution. they’re playing bubble disney world plan everyone follows rules, won’t interact anyone outside bubble. players tested daily special rings monitoring health catch symptoms. they’re wearing ankle monitors something like tracking location, they’ll know someone leaves. players leave bubble, need quarantined 2 weeks able play usage is, anecdotal experience, high. hear much us anymore though.

This think going bigger determining factor people think IMO. openings. protests etc certainly increase spread majority population taking social distancing mask wearing seriously likely see less increase. Places like say... texas i've anecdotally heard mask use low seem ones increase. India says hi ! Came say this. frequent flyer, already know care me, they're endangering fucking employees.  Nah.

You think goes that's looking 5 ago record Sweden surge testing. even bad pizza good Putin said   Trump  trusts Putin. people least likely wear mask ones likely carry virus wearing mask. Adding this, could make situation even worse, NASCAR race Talladega, Alabama week. track mandating fans wear masks allowing tailgating infield first track since sport resumed post COVID. Sure help things.  trying Sweden approach guess, without culture government safety nets.  👋 ""Stay fuck home"" used mean something... people anything want long call protest. That's precedent now, thanks BLM media... so...

Tomorrow I'm going go beach protest beach parking lot prices pandemic... I'll great time... wear mask... etc. ask, forced it. mean june 5th. guess SouthEastern PA green phase 26th. weird find elder care cultural thing well. cultures taboo nursing homes *expectation* parents start aging taken care kids.

I'm Indian, family expects take care mom old work. return she'll take care future kids. Definitely!! ever little exercise kid get fox, chicken, corn across river boat take 1 time? that’s knowing may undercounting deaths significant margin different ways virus manifest time!! Nah that's is. 

7 may : 821 new cases, 99 new deaths. 
5 June: 1143 new cases, 77 new deaths.

You think goes that's looking 5 ago record Sweden surge testing. Yeah. scary many cases reported since know showing cases likely thing we're killed. exactly thought read it. pursed lips breathing essentially. check Happy cake day! Myself, husband, daughter brother living mom's house saving bunch would otherwise thrown away someone elses mortgage might well help pay mom's half cost renting. brothers living dad's place. brother in-law living parents too. always ideal is. Blame governor I've renting since 20 never ever rent increase. people happy consistent renter. Minnesota already fully reopened, could scale back data far doesn’t look alarming it’s windy last days protests negligible risk transmission state overall ok (cases testing positive test rate still fairly flat low). 

L.A. starting get bad, though, second-most populated city country getting bad mean big trouble, course. Yep
But spike labor day took 3 weeks two

Seems like people get tested they've symtoms still need wait see
However I'm staying hopeful. see significant increase, means outside activities mostly ok. I'm also starting think that's case see huge spike florida opened beaches. joke's manages kill old people election day. downvoted? lol reported several news sites telegraph. Claiming rag Telegraph original article ridiculous. We’re land contradictions pleasure mine! lifting 10 years thanks you!

I’ll also lifting home till masks mandatory gym vaccine found. work SNF wearing mask January N95 February. co-workers thought crazy, I’ve vent wasn’t planning happening again. Nah not

You think goes that's looking 5 ago record Sweden surge testing. guess opposite flattening curve Vegas essentially super spreader event. possibly lose *years* life body fail sooner. won’t dead you’ll suffer lot lot longer.


Giving hours week makes sometimes decade suffering ends early death. 


This assuming nothing weird ordinary happens body.


So yeah, “lose” time..but want spend extra time end life shuffling constant pain depression? Cause working good eating (and assuming nothing weird happens) avoid lot that. government job improve someone financial position. called getting skills education let people make money. lazy want work fast food etc get deserve. supply demand left kids. One reasons housing shortage one talks folks inheriting houses, usually great starter homes, keeping renting. great idea really screws younger generation, everything built giant expensive, least high cost living area. Fuuuckkk happy rent didn’t go renewed last month..

Oh well.. agree, stupid abounds troubling USA intelligent society. Hopefully ones end contracting learning mistakes/ignorance, unfortunately know case. wish could afford single bedroom even $14/ hour I'm taking home less $1600 month. phone, car insurance takes quarter alone. Can't find 1 bedroom less 800/m bad neighborhood within hour drive job even include gas, water, electric internet. even get started food. start omad afford eat hobby myself. least I'm getting better shape it. 

The US desperately needs UBI hand bump protests yet either.

Wouldn't early tell? data would next week, it? would us even give shit left gym? People wanting get haircuts burning buildings, destroying small business, shooting cops, shooting other, illogically occupying public spaces. bit difference there. China hides data, bad! TX. maskless people older...not younger. always rig election safety meeting work actually discussed recommended distance people cardio like running 30 feet, complete news Mine Thank you! Parents cause poor mental health. warm summer definitely stop virus... count it, happened!
 
/s Arizona 1,054 per million. true, president said many times. ignored actually posted repeatedly vomit Abbot quote. 

I reject response. Care try actually address concern? Thanks! Why? read article? Even title stating facts, emotional element, nothing typical clickbaits. could arrest fraud. Guys gotten point dont know believe anymore. Doesnt matter says it. country currently divided. Even vacinee developed, large number people refuse get like flu?

/s think strong mitigation measures (shutting subway, bars, venues high density areas) high mask use served us well NYC. Combine still learning susceptibility immunity (not everyone exposed get infected, everyone infected actually spreads) may second influenza like wave winter.

There certainly cases reopen, inevitable, feel optimistic. Getting slap wrist arrested cannabis possession still ruins life.  close 100% recover. think ridiculous carelessness same, might well look bright side. Faster herd immunity via herd stupidity Get “passing wearing mask”bullshit. compromised can’t cardio without passing mask need stay home, likely blaming lack conditioning wear mask. want rewashable mask make one shirt bandana. Mask slightly annoying first you’ll get used wearing quickly. rock gym opened I’m blame fact went climbing 5.12’s V7’s barely getting V3. It’s cause spent last two months getting fat, ain’t mask nothing inability produce Vitamin then. 94% doctors died UK BAME, saying short money?

Basically think everyone else peddling talking absolute rubbish twisting create furore, plenty white coloured families living cramped accommodation UK. blame someone's living conditions historical racism crap. know plenty BAME UK earn lot me. official actual percentage ethnic minorities.

It's different genes. virus magically bother eatting.... Bunker Boy know ass hole ground. doesn’t matter IMO. Last election literally “silent majority” got Orange Idiot in. He’s lost virtually support time it’s supporters aggressively foaming mouth king calling anyone opposes idiot/weak/moron etc. He’s lost “silent majority” even base process. 

There’s feasible way see winning November, especially since seems insistent making COVID-19 worse every move makes. He’s also looking unhinged days pass. dont believe OSRS player talks wanting go outdoors. lmao subreddit great place misinformation spread quickly.

""There spike protests two weeks"" ""it's going six weeks see spike""

""One protestor gets virus week"" ""LOOK PROTESTS SPREAD VIRUS"" Wow, read Orange County. absolutely insane behavior. Florida started reopening May 4th wtf talking about.

And June 1st almost exactly two weeks ago. depends work tho. NYC nearly 1 million millionaires. Yeah idk, could even sold bonds used funds distribute masks globally developed countries. Yknow countries hate America reason.

Bottom line Trump white house opportunity lead nothing. ""It's bars; people going bars.""

Greg Abbot, probably hate it, way employers practally forcing employess back work, even COVID 19 even brought control yet. even worse, they, certian state governments threaten take people's benifits away, go back work. So, faced either going work gettting sick, getting fired starving. Minnesota huge backlog tests. won’t show days. June 10th reported like 8 cases. Clearly stopped processing tests riots curfews.

Seems powers need... think Governor leading charge limit spread mandating masks indoors public, closing indoor bars restaurants, releasing local governments add restrictions, right? Well 50% selfish pieces shit. live uk I'm confused... rent increasing every year sustainable? hell about? Im thinking age lot it. Florida Arizona known retirement spots people North. Also combination AC theory others said, tourist spot general idea COVID gone. 

Also go 0 2k per day overnight. likely started small clusters. get sick, others asymptomatic. could easily see cases spike NYC levels maybe beyond Governor FL give shit people. know would worse. world actually ending glib mother fuckers saying ""WE KNEW IT, TOLD SO"". Sweden done. ”Can’t second wave old people dead.” Still alive stealing. Wearing mask isn’t protecting yourself, it’s reducing risk may unknowingly pose others. It’s Arnie Arnie, example always tries be. problem employees though. can't quit public putting health danger can't refuse work go unemployment. lighting company says light products eliminate coronavirus. Hmm. That's necessarily true WWII.

People likely catch spread virus get infected earlier either become immune die. selectivity substantially lowers herd immunity level. think seen 1-1/R *anywhere*. LOLOL sub likes Biden!!!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  No, normal. new normal. did, days protests began. remember first several days, hardly mention all. Fauci face murders charges intentionally misleading people resulting many deaths.  way government get back credibility. 2392 June 16th. That’s fact. DeSantis periodically dismisses increase new cases result additional testing. say ""periodically"" mean days happened tests weekly average.

Never mind number weekly tests performed pretty steady never mind positivity rate increasing. psychologically easier use excuse dismiss facts face analytically.  Fair enough. 

Just trying point like people PRO anything... 2nd amendment folks monolithic group. said, MANY MANY MANY incredibly hypocritical. Nothing gets goat morons w/ Thin blue line flag alongside gadsden flag. 

I also agree hero complex misguided. mass shootings stopped ""good guy gun"", reality simply enough ""good guys gun"" around someone right time right place. Furthermore, training courses train people avoid conflict, escape etc. firearm deployed dire circumstances. 

While think claiming Michigan protesters ""wanted haircut"" bit dismissive oversimplified, think hurt cause mostly wearing masks. Wearing Mask simplest least obtrusive thing people do... common courtesy IMO. true pro mask sanitation, thinking takes spread people, another outbreak. can’t wait honestly, man absolutely national embarrassment Asian American population EXTREMELY responsible coronavirus. started canceling mass gatherings back January. Also lot arranged shipments KN95 masks hospitals things like that. think lot people blame China day goes becomes apparent Joe Plumber wheels fell America entirely fault.

As parent think coronavirus probably causes lifelong health problems short term want us get all, possible. think LOT parents thinking way well. friends are. higher next promotion, paying boat note sued. provide health care. I'm good job, I'm conscientious patient's safety well being.  see people think that's providing health care.  

Probably pay low. false equivalency going help.  Hi there, Governor. wanted say thank inspiration. 41 year old man never really great shape, comments Reddit videos encouraging exercise really helped motivate healthy kids family. version home routine lockdown helped loss gym, least now.

So thank awesome inspiring old dog like me. Also, Twins bomb. Joke's them; still click it. came reddit top comment summarize tell mostly bullshit, like every GET HYPE article scientific breakthroughs, 90% gifrecipes know try they're wrong. take eat. seated people live also quarantining I'm worried. future female. Isn’t “what go wrong, go wrong”? that? 

Because means that, seems pretty accurate Younger better older, right? It’s deadly them, fact. Seniors dont care leaving younger generation, pulling ladder way out. Generation gap never worse. Yeah no. going Korea, they're requiring mandatory 14-day quarantine government facility pay 1400 USD out-of-pocket for, matter are. AirBnb hotels *do not* count adequate quarantine spaces government. 

You'll also required check-in app multiple times per day self-report health status. 

IF fail so, deported immediately. 

They're playing around. 

I surprised Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong something similar.  Consumerism problem country.

Nobody seems understand difference need want, must satiate every want moment. pretty disgusting. dad dated cousin year, 50s. really weirded out, help gave list states first cousin marriage legal reassured something like half states. Except died dumb way. Charges gets broken wooden spear armor. could decent human beings voluntarily, wouldn’t mandated. baby using lungs pillows

That's expression remember! Imperial County, instance, flagged past two weeks seen average 773.3 confirmed cases per 100,000 residents — highest rate state — 27.2% tests conducted county come back positive, far exceeds state’s threshold 25 cases per 100,000 positive test rate 8%. Atleast 2020 better written _You watched_

_There secret system_  human nature, thing we're allowed talk think also fact economically impossible keep everything closed longer. Unemployment finite resource, businesses simply can’t stay closed long survive, people can’t pay rent going living street ect.  guy moonlight John Wayne stage shows? South Austin. night life me. Mask usage plummeting (across age groups). Seems nobody taking precautions before, even social distancing. seems nobody cares anymore. People got comfortable here. Sounds autoimmune can't stand ""fear"" narrative people right trying make. say things like ""Well live life fear I'm going afraid virus.""

It's living fear, realistic expectations highly contagious deadly disease. whole world thinks also doesn’t give fuck China thinks matter. Let China China. Lol actually believe ? 99% chance parents fine. Username checks out

.... Hey, judge yo fetish that's leader! 1 case many! Meanwhile orange stumbling Eagle scheduling infection rallies way Florida cornavention. cases increase thousands. Americans babies Lmao thought oregon sub, saw comments commending good Christians realized mistaken. Cant wait see second time around. 

It's like watching baby cut hair friends cheer on, state. foreigner, election system truly disgrace, hopefully change sooner rather later. 50 year olds aren’t category 20 30 year.

Well duh. killed old ones, told happy die economy! keep happening though. can't maintain zero cases unless become N Korea-like hermit kingdom. This..unfortunately public way naive this. wear gloves gas pump, put getting out, use card one hand, enter pin/zip, pump gas, throw away gloves, wipe card disinfecting wipe, use hand sanitizer, get home, wash hands. 

It's freaking process worth it. Ugh, many people going without masks around here, disgusting. see groups 2-4 people (families) shopping now; course never wear masks configuration. basically scared apparently makes look weak effeminate. look Trump/Pence pretty much every strong man right-wing leader world much avoid wearing mask cost.

I'm sure also lot reaffirming whole pandemic thing real threat. somebody refuses mask (especially authority figure), still send signal virus bad whole thing overblown even hoax. wore mask, would undermine entire agenda. Thank goodness. way protect nursing homes dying. stop death nursing homes move forward ethically. Serious question, many nursing homes get percentage-wise? second wave hit NJ/NY area would far less deadly basically already ravaged nursing homes already? side things, we're admittedly quiiite thought we'd we've setting records days head direction thought would. We're probably weeks away still.

I'm glad rapid deadly previously. We're woods yet, though. long shot.

While we're near 20% longer, still 12% dead vs recovered... approach could second wave spreading states. Meaning may see deaths spike again.

If makes wrong, I'll take it. I'm still crossing fingers closer to, lower than, hopeful 5% less. protests now, knows we'll another weeks. point lockdown flatten curve, eradicate virus. concept lost ridiculous sub? can’t stay shut forever, it’s feasible. walked bathroom one day cat chewing bristles toothbrush.  worry, free decide can't afford it. rest get go without food month, though. 

This stupid. want EVERYONE wants get vaccine. people get better everyone is. zero barriers up. I’m also curious though results kind bad luck sort way people get covid19. Like, enough people catch virus, would expected small percent unlikely result?  medical field. heard climate change since 2020. Yes. It’s considered terrorist act. person needs report him. yeah agreed man aren’t understanding protesters aren’t largely going care... people color harassed/assaulted/arrested/imprisoned/killed unjustly long time vs protestors might get sick won’t die. fighting people’s lives... serious. believe wearing masks - many - absolutely understand concluded protesting important staying home. believe it. Bodies process things differently immune systems really weird shit.  ""you da real MVP DeSantis"" know nice neurologist Lutheran hospital Wheat Ridge CO who’s really fantastic empathetic. you’re area try look old records see saw. forgive ignorance, flu caused avian coronavirus? Nobody's perfect. That's suppressing virus zero cases worth it. Go low, zero. Depends. figured originated in, say, Australia could factor equations disease spread. would affect future projections. Maybe would discover ntermediary species transferred disease humans.

There ton dont know disease still. stone valuable leave unturned. correctly - adequately prevent covid entering mask wear it, infecting take off, sanitizing mask safe way need sort training. It’s complicated think exact recommendations change regularly. 

Rather assume get entire globe country learn proper methods, they’re advising everyone wear best can.  long agree, tag people.

Your life must pretty pathetic. Exactly. America's problem lot population believes nothing happen them, going make people learn one way another. unfortunate, people actually take things seriously they're going learn mistakes rather examples. sorry hear bad thing happened. Murphy's law!""

also known r/LeopardsAteMyFace  Even protest, going track test everyone got near them? Large gatherings strangers seems like contact tracing dead-end. Well government said care lost cause. Everyone playing Russian roulette now, even ones taking precautions. Exactly. numbers data change people’s minds. It’s doom gloom, everything else downvoted hell. absolutely love “lockdowns” would stay lockdown years could  Well he's gotta blame someone Wow, almost like STILL highly contagious virus? even bars open, go there? go there, expect sterile environment even best circumstances, current era definitely not? sports deemed essential. It’s UFC event, NBA playing there. Yup. Parents time, send kids school. best kid innocently mentions you.  Still waiting first wave peak. (A wave defined lack media coverage)  situation critical, way people think. facts ground reveal potential importation european strain though contaminated food products. Given initial outbreak wuhan also thought originate seafood wholesaler, people China connecting dots starting think deliberately introduced country. People love spread nonsense try scare others.

Central Powers. It’s fuel needs taken seriously. second wave ? even finished first wave yet... owners meatpacking plants slaughtering employees cash. thrown chopping block  cousins. infuriating right? one seems give damn here. ""it's hoax"" ""if scared, stay home"" ""if get sick I'll fine"". Meanwhile, us care catch spread resign becoming hermits next year. Super. What's point ?  Paywall back though? overwhelming majority otherwise healthy people 60 effected virus. players staff testing positive MLB NFL, doubt events shut down. often find boat. nothing else, remember actions define you, actions define them. picking piece trash find street going solve litter problems, still feel better knowing part problem leaving it. FDA revoking emergency authorization chloroquine lack actual results, expect many ""breakthroughs"" fail deliver.

Medicine advance fast, especially crisis. pandemics referring exactly? far know one major pandemic got worse fall.

This nonsense fear mongering got stop. also take account people listening business owners desperate care. factors taking policy.

From understand, yes. Typically especially cities limited housing, exorbitantly priced housing, like New York San Fran.

I've never personally encountered it, though. I'm rural NM, *verbally* renewed lease year, taking month-to-month raise prices.

Proof 2nd wave? what, 21% positive anti bodies NYC? That’s alone enough slow spread (NOT herd immunity, slow it)  violent agreement topic. problem educated folks also amongst vulnerable. state may poor education stats, mean everyone dumb country bumpkin complete agreement masses.

Michigan checking in. Blows mind people latching one. people read article? Every board posted people actually believing 200+ airport workers right now. Cmon.. fault education system? ever taught? have. isn’t input. It’s pressure put system inability individual make meaningful change.

It isn’t racism existed. It’s TEACHING racist history form false version events.

I came poor highly educated family. parents studied countries younger due dual citizenship. went crap public schools poor neighborhoods barrio.

Most actual education came happened love reading history parents did. realized public school lying me.

Meanwhile mother became radicalized propaganda seemed forget everything used know.

Education propaganda root much. think telling half month since protests began, one guy getting covid-19 entire week's worth protesting apparently newsworthy.

For comparison's sake, sub yesterday post group 15 women getting covid-19 single visit bar. hope goes down. “in history” part optional.  went college I'm garbageman. Save sob story. Looking US state state basis, seems like there's basically 3 categories states right now:

* Hit hard initially, consistent downswing last weeks (e.g. New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts)

* OK initially, clearly getting worse (i.e. Texas, Florida, Arizona)

* OK initially, still OK (i.e. Minnesota, Colorado, Washington)

OK used relative sense course. think nationwide data bit misleading, since makes looks like US 4th category getting hit hard, starting recover, getting hit hard again, state really falls category beyond maybe Florida.

Now states cases increasing right dumb learning mistakes states? course are. far state level, think state explicitly made mistakes twice, something suppose. One big difference universal healthcare. People go doctor feel sick. US lot people insurance we've seen instances people billed Covid tests treatments, deter others. Can't stop wanna kill yourself, advise it. I’m Texas it’s suburban Uncle Mikes Aunt Karen’s although particularly bad it’s everyone seriously every race every age group, work bar see all.

Peeeerfect. experience. I've 8 flights driven work last 60 days I've seen: 


* Airport employees - Top notch compliance hand washing face coverings
* Travelers - 50% face covering airport; 95% aboard plane... major group seen masks children believe CDC recommending anyway. tried take masks talked flight staff airborne. Biggest problem I've seen 15-20% adults mask frequently pulling nose, back up, down, etc etc
* Flights - 20-50% capacity. single flight anyone row, directly front behind me. time saw full row family traveling together
* Disinfectant wipes given everyone board

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried get testing time multiple legs travel - want make sure I'm clean get plane everyone else... getting weirdly used swab; far I've tested positively, negative way. thought gonna one ""I dont WANNA wear mask though"" posts believing 'rona incredibly responsible going take one celebrity right Arnie. least Judaism non-kosher medicine allowed severe life threatening illness since preservation life takes precedence Jewish law. mild illness, allowed equal kosher alternative exist.

It's not? I'm done renting get lease September. I'm going back live parents new house. saving own. qualify first time home buyer zero mortgages too.

See

We testing per day absolute bases. bragging us testing most, ""wrong"" dumb works narrow definition per capita, positivity basis. go front, dumb, misleading, stopped testing. countries stopped testing? true false?

I know, also know trump knows. clearly throwing shade, at, know. Feels safe assume China, trump, could anyone. place throw shade, another dumb misleading thing says countries problem stopped testing?

So far know trump saying this? ""legitimate basis"" trumps statement. point merit trump said. said retarded. point people clamming said. lying said, said wrong enough give shit it, discredits people frothing mouth give shit. seam care much slamming dumb, bother take time slam actually dumb instead twist statement lie try make even outrageous thing said. plenty bad, would discredit position.

I conversation friend day, recently found list 52 things trump said totally outrageous. Going list interesting found 2 things list outrageous all, blatant lies make look bad. list maker feel need include 2, solid list 50 thing, 2 undermine whole list, 50 outrageous things good enough. That's bad enough two extra ones necessary reason. anti trump people, care, 2 part collection facts, honest mistake list maker long list all. Im expert either, biggest example give produce industry farm food. Many crops US picked using migrant workers coming Mexico, simply due fact many country willing intensive labor little pay, keep food prices cheap. Automation expensive front works certain crops delicate, timing food cycle regards seasonal produce continuity entire supply chain dependent workers.

Pilots ship workers transport cargo another, scale thousand people, takes one case right circumstances. know said international travel initially, also scale domestic US big cluster effects likely affected interstate travel different states different policies. people live hour's commute away place work, truckers delivery drivers essential long haul last mile journey, bus drivers paramedics cover huge distances, etc.

And business travelers tourists certainly essential travelers, people rely business major part economy. Hotel staff, everyone travel industry airlines travel agents, entire blocks stores restaurants dependent tourists foreign domestic. Thailand certainly hit much harder tourism accounting somewhere around 13% GDP according wikipedia idea economic situation, cant good. Keeping shut vaccine comes viable long term solution economically speaking. local, regional, national economy, either personal government level.

So need safe smart reopening, otherwise major suffering either economically public health wise. takes concerted effort every participant, thats going happen US least. we'll suffer economically health. Hmmm didn’t wish virus homicidal cops. expect me, others go work pay taxes fund irrational fear. 

And doubtless continually growing stronger.

*...I’ll see out.* going get ugly real fast. Isn’t essentially reproductive rate? I’d trust eyeballing curve. Again- I’m worried Texas states seem spiking- want us reality fears. sad. treat NYC counties one tell map. rest New York reported county. Wonder city different?

This interesting information could number factors behind it. Would curious know more. transportation troubles, they'll around early next year mop remaining humans Difference people actually gave somewhat shit back then. Now. Nothing gonna change. Pretty sure 5 year old nephew would make better decisions balding pos.

I’d say he’s like flamingo. rent went $25 four years ago. 3 bedroom house 3 acres $725 month. Sigh. Doesn’t convert month month after? even need sign new contract? daughter, asthmatic, especially difficult time masks. still wear them. Sometimes find isolated corner pull slightly breaths goes keep walking... 

It’s tough asthma too... pull away face breaths keep going need to.

These emergency workers thrown fire crazy think able keep working unending overwhelmed hospitals. there’s issue people needing care aren’t sick this. mean hes wrong tho, shit ton everyone running around unsafe. higher number 20-50 yr old tho, age group hospital work covid  ...And *much* younger patients getting?

Even work home, supposed *working* home. teaching kids. older kids school district eLearning set *actual* instruction, you’re probably ok. younger kids districts essentially assign busy work it’s parents actually teach content, it’s nightmare. Schools big, big problem don’t feel like we’re paying enough attention them. 

Flu outbreaks rampant public schools every winter talking virus vaccine already strands. actually schools near us shut several days due flu outbreaks getting hand. kids schools stayed open despite outbreaks. Imagine similar cases COVID herd immunity vaccine. It’s going mess. preach hygiene day, kids fucking nasty, plain simple. people actually antibodies would help SARS-COV-2 Coronaviruses would test positive antibodies. seriously hope US starts lockdowns again. Reopening dumbest fucking move right now, especially without mandated facemasks public. canceling Vegas trip September planned. really hoping things would better there's way would feel comfortable.

That’s certainly consideration suppose Ryopus' numbers June SEVENTEENTH. That's fact too.

Look, made simple mistake. big deal - move instead doubling down.  put comment doubt? have: A. lost job. B. Can’t afford go out.

Also, honestly believe children go back school September. pretending investigation would open unbiased, rather anti-Chinese hunt. Chinese stupid. realize effort lifestyle impact required fight climate change immensely larger. pay back 40 years inaction interest. Clickbait “uses hyperlink text thumbnail link designed attract attention entice users follow link read, view, listen linked piece online content, defining characteristic deceptive, typically sensationalized misleading.” don’t get it. I’m 20s healthy. get virus, really big deal. Still wear mask. 

The ones don’t wear masks seem ones effected hard get it... I've dealing neurological complications four months. job reopening soon, likely work months recover - best.

IMHO makes sense rush back unnecessary activities. virus chooses sideline you, going anywhere. 

We understand truly risk yet, either. I'm 30s, ran, lifted, ate organic got destroyed. One parents several risk factors got it, super mild case, never spent day bed it. little cough that's it. (thank god)

It galls dead properly counted, purpose misleading others harm, also worst disrespect erase person.

How people behave pandemic makes abundantly clear sociopaths are. Houston month ago: 

Haven’t heard/seen/smelled updates though. get tested checked IR gun. press pool. Still sends wrong message. looked this, first thought sometimes airlines operate ones -- American partner another line fly those? Chinese?  theyd put mask on

before unironically wear Asian-stereotyped medical mask

FTFY r/beatmetoit 80% infections thought asymptomatic mild. many reason, would someone who’s asymptomatic reason tested? true rate unknown. put lid otherwise cat try jump in.

And also cuz poop particles stuff. China owns company.. yes, people still think “yeehaw” complete political philosophy. Thats happening pretty much every poor countries around world. Really sucks us Oh remember. That’s loaded N-95 masks. knew well putting fake news there, knew coming Dec/Jan like many others here... yet failed prevent it. fact, fueled several times, including now. media government's job make dumbass. That's responsibility. need Harvard expert tell that. clearly tested much. Nowhere Constitution say wear pants!!! strongly agree. lack respect excuse for. bare minimum could wear mask. hard this? means could feelings?! Lol obviously. kind stomach issues? fever chills two nights ago, stomach problems might suggest food poisoning, going two days I've never felt cramping like lately parts gastrointestinal tract like this. Bit worried got gastro version Covid atm. Trump saw Fauci someone sell people pandemic, pretty decent job it. stocks dropped that.

Then American cope reality they've got idiot racist president lacks leadership racist cop dude I'm guessing Trump support killed black dude made feel good thought could get away it.

That's Trump's leadership led to. Protests streets riots fueled mostly right wing groups, meanwhile Trump's get rich steal power. Thank expressing thought I’m particularly proud of, well.

Enough, already, fucking morons. get amongst yourselves, attend rallies, go bar, let nature take course proportion population capable abstract thought risk assessment get lives. I'm super shocked. US many countries already signaled entire point investigation would find fault China, China might agreed one. Texas constantly elect worst person? fix economy time, can't bring people back dead. Seasonal flu .1% death rate

24K - 62K deaths per year can’t bare finish knows there’s going anything left. don’t mean defend US’ response, atrocious, consequence atrocious response widespread transmission ongoing since least February. simply can’t afford keep everything shut don’t capacity even massive testing (we currently test 400,000 people day). 

China, hand, free local transmission weeks priority containing outbreak. Containment FAR doable China would US considering small amount cases far linked single market much testing capacity available. know amount resources going fighting outbreak nothing compared resources would required can’t contain virus spreads country (the reality US currently living). Fucking barefaces mocked today work wearing mask. yup. It’s pretty crazy unprecedented pace is. follow every manufacturer’s data daily. Kind obsession.

Doubling place like NYC lot easier doubling place like Alabama.  like 2 worst ever flu seasons, 65k time high, 20-30k normal. Even example, CDC number Flu death 2018-2019 34k. But, here's big one, 15k confirmed positive test, rest estimated pool deaths year. 118,000 dead, confirmed test. estimated ""CDC flu death"" style number yet.  wearing masks gives people false sense safety. People 'forget' social distancing think safe enough masks. You’re right. police/rioters/law enforcement (whatever wanna call them) aren’t wearing masks.

Coronavirus loves gym to, pure breading ground did, plenty posted Covid dashboard. number 1. lot people start wearing mask 1 families got sick. Well think take solace fact states really locked all, started come waaaay back April, crisis.

And entire countries also chosen lockdown, none seen dreaded ""overflowing hospital"" problem except isolated incidents.

This increased severity attributed circumstances First World civilian life, [natural favors mild strain. get ill stay home, mildly ill continue lives, preferentially spreading mild strain. trenches, natural selection reversed. Soldiers mild strain stayed were, severely ill sent crowded trains crowded field hospitals, spreading deadlier virus. second wave began, flu quickly spread around world again. Consequently, modern pandemics, health officials pay attention virus reaches places social upheaval (looking deadlier strains Initially, talking testing, assume testing efforts focused counted most, elders. look stats see confirmed infections among people 20 comparison.

To put context, **eight times** number confirmed cases among 80+ 10-19 age group Sweden. 9075 vs 1123. Whereas Norway similar amount groups (493 vs 492).

Now capacity test younger generations, expected cases found.

Even though number new infections still high, age groups going up, going 80+ segment. last 30 days saw 2290 new cases age group, month ago corresponding number 3560. Hope number goes quickly!

And honestly older generations maskless ranting bring everything together. Younger people seem logical understand importance social distancing masks. wear mask, like wearing do. take states, laughter, mocking keep keeping on. ""based assumption Covid-19 around long time, meaning short-term lockdowns ultimately won’t help.""

What terrible assumption. Yes, seems like around long time, flattening curve good technique matter long. Moreover, decreasing cases we've bought time research.

Also, social activists criticiizing types people like days ago? remember seeing article r/politics. humas stupid. News articles like hyperbolic get clicks. Never mind population fraction now, lose almost 6 “WWIs” worth Americans heart disease every year, almost 3 “WWIs” due obesity. Duuuuuurrrrrrr Yikes. shitty. doubling every week. title wrong. doubling every 3-4 weeks. NEW cases doubled week.

The R0 Alabama around 1.08 No, said 'almost certainly'. 'almost certainly' new cases, could declare whole country virus-free? Absolutely, whole pandemic tragedy, end this, millions fellow humans likely lose lives don’t care real world. mom stockpiled crap ton food sister. personally didn’t choice.

Every week there's miracle drug/cure/vaccine that's followed week another report saying turns ineffective. added later know kicked saw video. said something like 'I thought someone bumped pushed me'.

What beast. It’s pointless argue conspiracy theorist. Check comment history you’ll see. things he’s said pandemic indicate doesn’t understand object permanence. (If don’t test won’t cases, etc)

It’s common psychological study children researchers generally concluded children understand object permanence age 2. ever noticed white supremacists never doctorates, Nobel laureates Harvard professors? 

This kind comment makes wonder people like racist sheltered uneducated make insensitive comments sheer dull-wit feel bad putting others makes feel superior.

I one marketing hacks. recent assignment working company early stage drug discovery trying predict market would need drug would launched ten fifteen years later. Trying research unmet needs are, trends studied already, likelihood success was, challenging. 

Too often drug companies work well, end ""why bother that?"" product. part marketing - know seem like it, is, contact payment came from, marketing budget. financially feasible sadly.

No one would want work 7-14 day shifts. lure people willing homes would pay high rate one could afford there.

That's it. Partially wanma go full time education high school middle school level (will done student teaching May become certified History English) teachers get enough health benefits decent enough salary allow upward mobility partners. wife start working get full time teaching position making $40kish plus healthcare cause would actually ahead..

I currently eligible benefits non profit special education organization work job offered also didnt offer them. job offer good health benefits almost better play game cases. We're okay right now. working two days week 40% salary, enough qualify unemployment, looks like, would pay making now, considering $600 extra.

But I'm still working full time, home, moment (For good ill. really hard concentrate right now). also able pause student loan payments we're struggling bit right (and say struggling retirement savings could tap to, we're trying that).

Once pause student loans over, though, things going get lot harder us. Hopefully she'll somehow find new job then. problem lies probable Covid deaths.

New York particular recording people Covid deaths without testing virus, also sending Covid patients care homes bad move given people care homes generally people real risk dying Covid.

Interestingly even New York many infections less 0.002% people 40 New York died past 3 months. PPE training jobs knew public would dumb them, underestimated dumb Thank you!! Thank you, I'll check out! mean, also allow sports stadiums months do. Circumstances changed, that's all. VERIFIED. Trump's name checks out. heard Nancy Joe speak?

But, even beyond that, want say US 3.25 people now, math time US lives stake WWI since first COVID death. 4.4 times days WWI days since first Covid19 death. So, need also consider side ramp deaths on, appears accelerating ending. So, quick math shows 1917 equivalent 500,000 American deaths Covid19 accounting time. Even take 3.25 people argument consideration, still nearly 160,000 1917 American death equivalents. 

Your argument utter shit. It’s bad Sweden it’s sharp increase. Sweden always zero cases Sundays, close zero Saturdays, see slew reported midweek rinse repeat.

I still cautious, social distancing, wearing mask, etc. 
Although may done pandemic, definitely done us. 
Also, much misinformation hard get mass majority people page. 
Its shit show opinion completely control fall. Yes like pathogens meeting took backseats Rona. Everything still there. meant way new influenza strains circulating every year. like nuclear waste? practically hear drooling death numbers here, even pretend care? face problems,you can't fix them. There's huge difference self awareness ""self loathing"". Sure, virus evolves Airborne II ""a slight cold""--it's slight cold at-risk people elderly people many people lung conditions, diabetes, etc., hope following guidelines least sake. 

I add found many people, even formerly healthy people, gotten Coronavirus overcome left 20 30% reduced lung functioning researchers sure go away, well take little seriously Isn’t fact enough compare? 

“We zero deaths today, Sweden?”

“No idea: backlogged people dropping dead won’t know week two many people died today. Call two weeks compare see well are!” reason number vast vast majority Covid cases mild people experience symptoms symptoms never seek health care get tested.

New York State anti body testing. prelim found 13.9 percent, round two found 14.9 percent. Using number...and multiplying population 19.45 million. 2,898,050 people exposed. 

New York State 35,338 confirmed probable covid deaths according =1.21 IFR don’t even know anyone surveyed... CDC, referencing recent studies recommend wearing masks. since become political football people feel like wearing mask cool.

I guess tens thousands people dying enough justify minor inconvenience expense getting wearing mask public. There's end-game yet totally new (if predictable) situation modern society. We're still figuring way out. thousands protesting maybe might teeny tiny impact? cover here! Arnold Schwarzenegger exactly masking reason refusing go inside longtime California gym.

According TMZ, ""Terminator"" star bicycled Gold's Gym Venice, Calif., Tuesday morning workout. 


While Arnold, 72, wearing mask due coronavirus pandemic, noticed several gym members middle workouts wearing masks. Front desk staff informed Arnold people required wear masks entered certain common areas, law require wear masks they're actually working out.

Upon hearing explanation, TMZ said Arnold went front desk lift single weight inside Venice gym, essentially royalty. website added Arnold's exit meant political stance — simply concerned other's safety.

 
The former California governor ""will stay clear Gold's people start wearing masks floor — there's vaccine,"" TMZ said.

Last Friday marked first time gyms several California counties could reopen doors, forced close March due coronavirus pandemic. cat that, too. bought toilet brush, secured radiator pipe, brush do. (She's super weird.) Yeah typical “it doesn’t affect me” therefore, “I don’t care”. I'l take property! not. *Some* state (i.e. north) may strict, it’s big state. 

You’ll notice 90% cases coming LA county bordering counties. they’re reopening lots services - people eating restaurants again, they’re getting hair cut, us told every day longer allowed work home. Exacerbating situation fact many people don’t bother wearing masks public. train I’m sitting right now, probably half people covering faces nobody bother telling otherwise it’s widespread. Well. appears new cases - two quarantine breakers UK. 

I stand said. hope tracing system (~300 contacts 2 days) effective enough catch quarantine everyone came contact with.

Don’t even get started shite US response 🤦🏻 literally saw headline local news last night said coronavirus pandemic planning end july 25th. rewind see lol. Can't second wave first wave end! feel you. think people eager believe things cater feeling good end believing lies fantasies let later. chase next potential ""positive thing,"" rinse repeat. appears evading reality favor dopamine delusion; people like makes sense take outlook perceived ""pessmistic"" onlookers highs lows aforementioned behavior exhausting seems touch reality. get old seeing ""new drug!!!!"" constantly, nothing comes except little hoard overly optimistic people celebrating buy time.  awhile something demonstrably positive happen two weeks since last protest? know Spanish Flu actually *Spanish* Flu right? enough indicator populace careful. team taking precautions. nope, say, (relevant lyrics) over-reporting anywhere. impossible run enough tests correctly register deaths, let alone add enough false positives list.

For now, ignore official number deaths take account mortality difference 2019 2020, usually 2 times big official deaths. Except Belgium, actually shit right using purely statistics estimate deaths instead raw data obtained unreliable tests futile attempt accurate.

Though case China can't really trust either numbers data likely manipulated purpose rather misreported technical problems. PA one oldest oldest population age country. So, yes. Wondering thing... Georgia one first re-open Kemp lifted restrictions Bars, etc.

Seems strange we're seeing dramatic increases reflected numbers. need get more. Obviously there's Hawaii Disney World. Duh. Alright, see tomorrow exact time, pattern Or... protestors experiencing surge ? GI issues heartburn cause tightness chest. ""The virus racist!""

Or, prefer: ""Racism *real* virus!""

(Which actually interesting theory think possibility memetic viruses) Yeah, even shut today locked another month case increases. won't, making current spike open ended backend someone assumes responsibility right thing. Sure, really want to. make sure wear mask dual purpose staying safe letting people know identity. ""Kids fine"" except immunity issues like. teachers? lots older teachers.

Apparently not. Right! what’s happening one three successful states handling covid, imagine what’s going 47. Went Lowe’s day employee wearing mask around chin half time, didn’t pull past nose, hopeful mask wearing would last another weeks. GI issues could literally anything.

120K people died corona corona.

The vast majority people would dead virus. Google says yes, do. Meanwhile New York 12x that, smaller population. No, Sweden worse makes things uncomparable... Everyone else pretending exist anymore eh, whatever. 185 would considered overweight, obese. Makes point. It’s stupid system base anything concrete on. literally says article return work financial reasons. ones forcing work people bills pay. wish idiots would suffer stupidity rather inflicting everyone around them. Every day right? think peak deaths like 2800. carry umbrella either. wonder two things come root cause trying imply hardy enough need it. Great Work! Someone give redditor gold! selling actual colloidal silver? Jim Bakker crackpot snake oil saleman colloidal silver insane since many benefits. issue markets corona “cure”. could definitely valid way help body immune system , way extra Vitamin C etc. Makes sense. seems pretty nonsensical _not_ require masks workout obviously going point highest respiratory exertion. Uhhh... employees businesses opened scientific advice every jackhole Texas visiting sans mask. Yup. it’s happening front it’s fake. first day social distancing BLM protests. But, later many people pissed systemic injustice decades massive turn out. doesn’t compare 2 months haircut. Also, doesn’t help police kettling BLM areas. Anyway, they’re still open air lessens transmission vs indoors still exercising much precaution masks sanitizers say cops complete disregard disrespect. NYers weren’t masked, would’ve seen huge spike now. think masks huge factor here. docs nurses exposed Covid patients least # cases. proves masks work. Good genes, good news. People good genes like Trump fall ill. US become world's super power people? way beyond understanding... wouldn't.

The reason number vast vast majority Covid cases mild people experience symptoms symptoms never seek health care get tested.

It's minor virus low death rate.

The 5.4% among already ill hospital.

It's like counting fatality rate care homes every year saying average person 10% chance dying year. gym gold’s gym anyone equally pissed wasn’t title /// When. family members die may change mind lot cases gone undetected deaths.

Interesting Zealand lockdown success story

...

it absurd compare UK response Covid-19 New Zealand. densely-populated country heart international commerce always going deeply affected country limb southern ocean, 1000 miles landmass. 

If New Zealand going devastated epidemic anything would scrapie, Covid 19 – even sharp reduction recent years still 27 million sheep, nearly six every man, woman child. largest city, Auckland, population 1.6 million, compared London’s 9 million.  

New Zealand country rural settlements low-density suburbs social-distancing come naturally – opposed Britain huge numbers live tightly-packed housing commute crowded tube trains.

Moreover, Covid-19 arrived New Zealand middle summer, viruses lowest chance spreading.

The University Maryland mapped early outbreaks virus found concentrated belt northern hemisphere average temperatures range 5 11 Celsius – Britain throughout March. 

Ardern’s government credited closing borders – 19 March. Yet somewhat easier self-sufficient food and, thanks geography, relatively little international traffic. New Zealand 700 international flights landing airports week – Britain day. addition, trains ferries arriving European countries constantly – source traffic New Zealand have. particular, lot arrivals Spain Italy, virus already well established.

Far quicker respond coronavirus, New Zealand fact locked day later Britain, 25 March. Prior that, like Britain, country went week partial, steadily increasing social distancing measures. Gatherings 500 people banned 12 March. Bars restaurants close 23 March, two days Britain.

Jacinda Ardern served adviser Tony Blair’s government. stayed become British Prime Minister would almost exactly experience done.

There's still water first wave next wave follows it, high water peak individual wave--it's lowest point them. point first wave ends second wave begins point daily infection rate steadily begins increase period previously steadily decreasing. need period time free infections say first wave ended second one begun, rather period seen sustained decrease daily infection rates two periods time infection rates higher. one many reasons America fucked. loaded tits morons. Top bottom, seriously, google it. That’s whole 0.5 percent life! huge sacrifice, proud struggle endured.

Pretty much states growing outbreaks hot af right now.  Hey everybody,

I work meat industry distribution side got notice prices going November due increased exports China. 

80% pigs killed due virus bumped American imports. raised prices 10-20% COVID virus even started. 

I wouldn’t really blame American government unless get intelligence states knew COVID prior November states. 

Also isn’t Smithfield. many American farms/meat producers exporting China. 

Before virus exports like good business. increase profits limit production; China always bought meat states, usually upwards 30%.

Remember 80% deficit balance. 

Unfortunately nobody could predicted novel virus ripping production facilities needed most.

Shitty situation around confirm stocks pork beef back last week, stay way unless virus runs rampant production facilities again. This. real international fame; people recognize even can't pronounce last name lol. Even he's shrunk age still stands people, too.

Honestly, thought would civil strife (far beyond protests) effects climate change. Never considered pandemic, honest. there's much playing around me... Sweden got big influx cases week, place Denmark Norway. fact still much cases neighbours shows that, unlike neighbours, can't contain infections. Death numbers way compare, Swedish testing lackluster. Good point, though necessarily A/C units. air flow closed windows. study done China, using restaurant example, virus transmitted people even close someone infected. 

It also helps explain get much worse weather turns cold places. Enclosed spaces air Thanks response! say ridiculously obvious everyone know source all. Yet contradicts [CDC CDC claims numbers include cases covid listed cause death ""presumed"" ""probable"" cause death. I'm sure they're lying criteria.

Fauci admitted reason Americans initially discouraged using shortage, Adams acknowledged second part February concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply,” Fauci told The Street. ""We wanted make sure people, namely, healthcare workers, brave enough put harm's way take care people know infected coronavirus, danger getting infected. want without equipment needed.""


No shit. Everybody half brain saying lying, everybody was. we're even worse off. Nobody wears mask 'cause *they're effective.*

Bullshit. wronged Americans set bad precedent this. worked lot wood. Cases Arizona, Texas, Florida surging yet remain steadfast laissez faire approach reopening. We've known Arizona hot spot week governor still take adopt easiest prevention measure politics? ""Masks help absolutely need frontline workers. Please make cloth masks keep medical grade masks doctors nurses"".

But no, lie we're shitshow. Can’t even compare two. really hop post history write comment? didn’t realize made upset. I’m sorry. ONS buddy.

As said, registered deaths. anticipated. 1/3rd marginal. stopped eating. go without wearing mask. make habit wearing mask. Seems like there's dogpile hyperfocus states criticized reopening quickly, yet there's mention states reopening stable/declining numbers, crickets.

Why celebrating states well, focusing aren't? become political football 

And that? theissue politically driven science based. guess tens thousands people dying enough justify minor inconvenience expense getting wearing mask public 

Or - case, emotionally driven.

As stated earlier, science back emotionally politically driven arguments simply exist. fact, proper RTC studies done show benefit wearing masks. 

 flipside, potential medical harm individual wearing mask. Second, societal psychological harm forced wear mask public.

In one large RCT Japanese health centers, health-care workers wore respirators suffered significantly headaches cohort workers wear respirators. statistically significant outcome. Furthermore, professional health-care workers self-report significant discomfort wearing respirators, therefore often adjust remove them, contrary protocol. healthcare workers, circumstances scientific basis wearing respirators, suffer headaches discomfort, negatively impact intended health care.

More broadly, potential health hazards population-scale extended personal mask use studied. Potential health hazards include factors as:

* constriction breathing itself, including flow restriction, recycling CO2 vapour-laden breath
* breathing-in particles, fibres chemicals mask-material itself, new mask aging, used, washed, sun-bleached masks
* retention particulates adsorbed substances proximity face, would normally expelled exhaled breath
* collection, concentration retention particulates adsorbed substances environment onto mask, proximity face
* reactions particulates adsorbed substances mask, including shedding virions virion-carrying nano-particles larger mask-captured droplets

Such factors studied, yet population-scale policies extended mask-wearing implemented without rigorous scientific basis. 

It's pretty clear many others like want mandatory wear masks, - apart emotional based responses - unclear why. ""Pro-life"" corporate masters made clear need example millions Americans. need perpetuate lie COVID real concern, created Left, everyone needs go back world continue nothing happening. Status quo important keeping masses control, especially mountains evidence align going it. clear, white house complicit pushing agenda make people believe COVID problem anymore. insidious though, deeper background agenda devaluation human life country - particular lives average citizens. “But many deaths system manage?”

Feel free isolate/quarantine rest life you’re extremely scared elderly breathing issues... don’t expect rest world same... Life moves on, like not... Yeah PA actually good rn Thats best theory. Cases fairly low weather good people outside more. unbearably hot, people back inside cases rising. fewer people wearing masks now. original comment simply answered question population levels, enlistment army levels. made claim feelings that. 

Then people responded that, stated opinion it. 

Which simple: lives equal. Therefore deaths equal, surviving lives also equal deaths. Therefore covid deaths, terrible, extra special me. 
 
I cannot see way claim lives equal without coming conclusion.

Therefore two conclusions:

All lives equal covid deaths special

Or 

lives unequal covid deaths special. NYTimes said New Yorkers seeded country — March wasn’t late. states mild epidemics time. Agreed. terrifying. Thousands people dying every day. remember seeing pictures news brought freezer trucks parked streets store people died morgues funeral homes run space. parked right front used work. used walk street every day. unreal kid high school graduation person. actual graduation part done thoughtfully felt like arena safest public space I've since March. graduate limited two guests, guests assigned seats min 6 ft apart - people sat further. Masks required everyone. Assigned entrances/exits arena based seating. 

Then almost everyone left, respected ""please congregate arena grounds parking lots"" instead went downtown area crammed restaurants bars. Definitely grads families kids still gowns, despite heat humidity. least bit surprised hear people getting sick.  It’s mysterious. stopped educating people. 

Our public schools underfunded garbage higher education expensive luxury.

Pair decades propaganda baby you’ve got stew. ignorance. one hand dont care, hand do. 
I dont care Trump got virus upset. 
I care lot people look follow does, meaning that, doesnt wear mask, people think dont need either. make nasty, unfounded personal attacks like one made. sound like one church goers like deny science.

No matter what, got many people people packed together like sardines even outside going spread.

Add this, think people getting protests? Going bathroom protests?

Many completely forgetting covid carpooling together. taking transit. Bathrooms, public. Again. nonsensical wandering moronic reply points type medical treatment available country origin? 

This kind comment makes wonder people like condescending inferiority complex socially inept. 🤔 really comparing people marching outside people stands soccer game? Yeah, obviously that's much denser sure majority soccer crowd wearing masks. feels like stop working two weeks shed muscle Oh dear. quarantine month science dictates would eradicate virus. Nuclear waste recycled spacecraft use. I’d say they’re highly useful. Expecting good faith republicans bad health. Result: Data scientist gets fired... patent it, exactly video says done.

I like mask all, seems clunky heat strings may shift miss spot. hotbox, UV box, oven seems like better solution. guy right though, disposable masks seem like bad idea need billions day. quite. People abandoned social distancing. believe weather cooler would seeing even higher numbers. valid way help body immune system , way extra Vitamin C etc

So talking internal use colloidal silver. Let's see studies testing information body process utilizes silver. place needs Florida (re) posts. saying you’re wrong might reflect moment possible alternatives. lockdown strategy pretty much requires vaccine market near future. California population: 25,000,000
Wyoming population 500k.

California electoral college votes: 55
Wyoming electoral college votes: 3

California electoral vote per citizen: ~450k

Wyoming electoral vote per citizen: ~160k

The difference? ~2.8

Wyoming resident votes hold 2.8 TIMES representative power electoral college resident voting California.

The electoral college essentially extra white rural America sway based current, historical demographics. 

It absolutely abolished sake democracy.  saying it’s private matter saying there’s already enough transparency? two different claims. r/freefolk gas station sells 5 pack 5.99. Dallas. said “everyone protested perfect.” you’re reading hearing things may it: insane. all, current administration sure “whole America” approach term... Yeah, freedom? Well done Gibraltar  Sadly expected happen Sweden travel restrictions lifted infection sadly probably exported epicenters places previously less affected. best hope proposed Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure comes online ASAP, pale hope sadly. hear lot isn’t increased testing indicator people getting sick coming testing least partially? genuine question. assume grabbing random people testing get better picture. tried it, nearly passed squats. yeah exerted more, finish workout, help either. Hahah seeee? Another effect pandemic making stay home moms believe managing irrationalities toddlerhood less stressful public/at workplace/avoiding modern day plague every day. (And honest, days, i'd rather work, virus virus. Staying home nice change pace years academia). new White House talking point ""We cases testing more.""

WTF Cnn saying it’s safe? BS alert Shut till 2021 minimum. support staff mean she’s practitioner. think news disservice labeling everyone healthcare worker people hear think doctor something like that. 

I’m glad smarter woman unfortunately techs I’ve met usually intelligence moron. Trying claim equivalency Coronavirus deaths WWI (or war) deaths wrong face.  War kills young people prime lives. leaves young children fatherless, creates young widows, impact surviving family members emotionally financially rest lives.  Every soldier died WW1 probably cut 40-50 years expected life. Coronavirus might cut 8? 

What's next? Coronavirus kills people Holocaust? think you’ll see something weird happen colleges robust online executive programs ~fine~ already established fee structure faculty ready work, colleges university go broke. might see Business schools trying break state universities, Liberal Fine Arts throw chairs titanic other.

What envision actually local university owns lot things could use purposes - dorms easy convert negative pressure quarantine centers, agriculture programs grow food usually do, large sports stadiums would make excellent locations solar towers. futurist. thats hard one. legally sue taking job life risk? Well, claimed know anything Chinese politicians. 

The thing wanted verify allowed write/think freely. based answers seems case. Well shit..That’s good idea. Haha that’s alright want dm! bench, shoulders destroyed body building days. uses machines. Lots foreclosures empty properties coming Florida, July 2021. Cool, cool, cool. We're best worst. problem isolate literally thousands people going out? already isolated travellers sneaking hotels visit loved ones sightseeing goodness sake. little community transmission whole Australia every new case getting people coming overseas. isolated hotels quite hotel workers caught virus. saying people tested positive covid murdered coroner listed cause death covid? source that? Unless closets full ammo, run couple days absolutely is. Easier run faster cliff slow go back people. many 260 workers going self quarantine? maybe 10% lucky? Recent Korean study implies transmission outdoors way less risky indoors. Also live protestors wearing masks cops much. Yes! could be? Except, highest number deaths reported single day since May 15.

I admit however, newly reported deaths actually occurred week ago. Bay Area Rapid Transit Sweden: Norway: 242 (20x less Denmark: 598 (8x less Finland: 326 (15 x less Sweden)

Sweden little bit less twice population Denmark twice population Norway. adjust population per capita numbers get:

Sweden: 499

Norway: 45 (10x less Sweden)

Denmark: 103 (5x less Sweden)

Finland: 59 (8.5x less Sweden)

Don't get wrong. Sweden catastrophically poorly initial phase compared neighboring countries. obviously trying cherry pick numbers obsessed making Sweden look bad possibly can. I've heard sounds like California's increase attributed highly expanded testing, positive test % seems generally OK, they're quite badly place like Arizona Texas is. 7 day average cases LA County actually bit past two weeks, although still much higher even controlling population size (they 4.36x number cases per capita San Francisco).

It's hard judge California since huge state though, like rest country areas alright others much worse. woman article, complaining people wearing masks, photograph wearing incorrectly.  want kids play together playgrounds pools. think wear masks. actually understand implications herd immunity actually means.

Your ""opinion"" hurting people tangental ways.

I'm responsible teaching critically think plenty resources interested. Jfc strange sad combination circumstances befallen you.  sounds like mothers irresponsibility endangers health others around simultaneously making worst public health crisis we’ve seen century worse last far longer needs to. 

People like absolutely kill me, look countries took masks, distance lockdown periods seriously, able near fully reopen without killing bunch people. 

Until people like sober take seriously, we’ll left never ending cycle waves lockdowns many thousands deaths ... wont wear masks stay fuck home. 

To make matters worse, seniors supported officials continually deny aid actual workers could sheltered place, continue deny access healthcare . 

You’re wrong resenting her. It’s joke. Last week ran story bear getting vehicle California. Twice saw. Pathetic. house always wins. Outdoors safe. think I'm dishonest to? Well, yeah, killed wealthy people. ORD

Cool story. live North Cali, people wearing masks people stopped wearing masks businesses. Bars opening soon :/

I'm guessing **way** north, Humboldt-status, I've literally never heard anyone Bay Area call ""North Cali"" (it's always NorCal Northern California). Hyperbole. side projects “fake news” don’t need add ammunition early epicenters started reopening last couple weeks. It’s way soon celebrating. Hahahaha making day population density important understand. compare un like things easy pat back. timeline important also, north east hit hard early on. weather effect florida set summer. dont think US whole handled thing great lives saved lives saved. Fixing zoning laws. ton areas increasing population allowed build enough housing accommodate it. Landlords put lot pressure local government ""keep local neighborhood charm"" shit order protect fiefdoms. Fuck America, know cases going continue grow. Dont need individual state updates, country pit together. coming subreddit advice likes this, already overthinking it. Follow common sense. test comes back negative, continue use mask sanitize responsibly. positive, there's answer.

Just use common sense, trust gut. feel unsure it, don't! responsible, able live little too! Pretending pandemic gone away money passes leadership today America. People said lockdowns first time around. can't say case here, deaths noisy metric due outbreaks nursing home / long-term care facilities. I've got four possible factors.

1. upward trend really started end May. could see deaths spike well, yet.

2. first wave burned lot people susceptible dying already, leaving cases recoveries.

3. better treating now, leading recoveries previously.

4. continuing get incorrect information Florida governor caught multiple instances manipulating figures tourism income. church went to, pastor said sermon Americans love affair Apocalypse.

Hopefully pop anything. seems like people really want right florida hotspot. ""Market value"" imaginary number landlords use mitigate accountability. Yeah, you’re massive mental gymnastics, take break.

Seasonal flu nothing like Covid. I’ve yet put dialysis seasonal flu. Also, bears shit woods! ;D There's 8M NYC buddy. I'm sure, maybe he's referencing first amendment saying forcing someone wear mask limits freedom speech somehow?

In McKee's case, doctors believe virus simply went dormant first bout illness, theory backed by [Dr. Benjamin virologist head biology department Texas A&amp;M University-Texarkana.

Being poor sucks.  suckage appear racism since higher proportion black people poor.  living neighborhoods big cities also sucks likewise frequent black people frequently poor, addition residue racism current racism.  

I think gets called racism days classism well people want poor people people act like share values around. work food service. several friends. also friends work grocery stores, even things like house cleaning. it’s literally impossible keep distance everyone. Why’s that? I’ve focused hospitalizations/deaths. Even though deaths fudged.  simple Brit, I'm certain constitution. trying highlight common argument falls apart common decency.

Or, perhaps accidentally strawmanning opposing mask wearing, apologise due unintentional. Yes, lot cases missed mild symptoms. IFR uses antbody studies estimate total cases infected. 

The gap total cases known cases really spreads, known cases isolate better. look countries stayed top track trace isolate like Australia, New Zealand South Korea, CFR closer 1% indicating never let unknown community spread happen key preventing outbreaks. New-West-East-SOBO North Villiage

I'm listing house now. thought pretty widespread knowledge, official knowledge obviously government would never admit this. mentioning two different numbers, daily reported new cases daily reported new deaths.

The daily new cases increasing due increased testing.

The daily new reported deaths going 0 100 depending lag reporting (few staff working sundays report, wednesdays synchronising databases 30 days old). deaths booked actual day, easy see decline since mid april high.

I live Alabama legit one wearing masks social distancing. people generally see retail food workers wearing even still pulled like chin straps, noses poking out. sure help people legit call fellow employees stupid wearing them. Alabama fuck backwards even funny.

US government would good nuke Alabama, Florida, Georgia Mississippi clean earth. we’re joining militias now. Didn’t get memo? point owner ask move they're hook find new place 30 days notice. Yeah like confederate flag waving armed snowflake ""give haircut give death"" idiots think wearing mask stealing rights. sure would said obedience. think related looking other. Team Five Million that. median salaries across city also evolve similar degree arrival amazon?

The salaries neighborhood did, neighborhood mostly people work Amazon make $200k/yr. That's expensive live landlords demand rent values sleep night?

It's market rate. There's nothing magical it. apartment there's enough demand someone paying $4k/mo offer $2k/mo, giving break first person happens put application. person makes $500k/yr Amazon, handing free money.

If want slow growth rental rates, need build more. Desirable real estate never going super cheap. find 2 bedroom downtown Seattle next company hires engineers thousand incredibly high salaries price 2 bedroom Nebraska. They're gambling lives Among Roosevelt carrier sailors found neutralizing antibodies 59% hundreds infected month three later. 

Herd immunity valid talking virus mutate immune response lasts long as, say, flu chicken pox. kind goes window come close achieving early patients susceptible reinfection. 

Even worse, patients reporting persistent symptoms last months ""recovering"" infection. lot victims describe Covid symptoms want imagine first time around fit. prospect getting reinfected high risk infected within past 6 months terrifying. Vegas interesting since usually bunch state tourists there, anybody group gets virus think they'd count Nevada stats. There's probably less tourists though, maybe big deal stats. 1) quit, here's important thing seems miles head: smoker, never downplayed health dangers associated smoking secondhand smoke. matter fact, *it realization things* made want quit (and eventually succeed so). Never, point life, would argued health risks *to others* associated smoking ""a joke"" compared thing killing people.

2) are, CoVid subreddit, calling said disease ""a joke"" ccompared secondhand smoking. That's certainly relevant helping. /s

So, ask - fuck about? think referring CoVid joke, compared anything else, good thing? Yeah, true government official care rando redditor's postings. basically thought information there, shared, people change minds even tiny effects *potentially* make difference.  think mental corruption what's floating surface this. Irrational unhealthy mental states becoming magnified nation anyone else see. Disinformation? disinformation straight lying. 

Do sources reputable scientific communities research organizations? organizations looking make profit? Live free die!!!  also live UK.When renting, rent went every year, generally 5%. following track hospital usage FL 

 

So reason full-ish turned elective surgeries back people taking beds procedures? COVID-19 infections taking space.

I wish state would tell us current COVID Hospitalizations reading articles 50 50 covid patients regular icu patients.

Unfortunately diseases issues dont stop happening, covid hits ICU beds double whammy. Would mean snacks, drinks meals? least early April shut down. never result anything similar home rentals falling, next? Commercial real estate rentals go down? Housing prices fall? mean real estate taxes also go down? \*fingers crossed last one\* Yah Idk. Maybe consider vendors 25k? idea. 

No. removed definitely still there. Might weird reddit glitch. long isn’t corona then. nation took swift action suppress virus advantage didn't. first wave still rolling USA likely many states reenter lockdown protect healthcare systems overwhelmed. Regardless drawbacks home ownership, compare dealing shitty rental companies/land lords. kids house soon they'll welcome live long need. Perhaps dumbest comment day. probably one idiots turned carrier. Killing granny isnt going accomplish anything. politics respecting science prudence. They're worried bend pandemic, they'll bend climate change.  RemindMe! 1 year ""Is US already 407k covid deaths?"" She’s fucking idiot.

Thanks pointing out. I'll change it! Three weeks schools try reopen, understand better. stop 2030, 3 years living inside metro tunnel's. Yeah true. next guy came wanted mandatory mask rule got bullied removing it. lot cities mandating still.. but.. people care. mean there's lot people listen, there's lot don't. Regardless type discussion believe having, still wrong conclusion, unsupported historical contemporary data. flu. Durrrr. It' one ""issues"" brought fired data scientists made another dashboard. shown case refuted. saying fixed since got caught hands cookie jar. 

 

"" *The state’s testing tally reflects number tests conducted, many people tested, state data guide shows.* "" Yikes, imagine understanding basic concepts like population density understanding effects effectively virus spread. Imagine ignorant uneducated. ever NY?  whiteness per se, f'd social system parts country particular white people raised believe certain way. Norway mostly white see kind behavior there, many European countries course mostly white.

Rent increases UK, too. Um maybe make masks mandatory first? one airline mandated them, happened like yesterday? Bad leadership. That's also single data point factors. seeing little spread low population density areas.   Economic models often wrong. happened multiple times pandemic, happened 2009, happened throughout modern history.

Honestly inability criticize shortcomings field scares me. epidemiologists know far critical work far. Mostly saying tools identify trends enact policy. scientist convictions terrify me.

Sweden vs. Norway natural experiment. confounders? Yes, close going get terms policy differences pandemic.

You also address points, off-handed dismissal well-received here.  pay 3k/month 2 people. gross salaries around 350k though. know actually whose changed back who's cause I'm illiterate dumbfuccc.
Thanks pointing out. I'll change it! Bullshit basically looked confused brushed shoulder suit went back thing. Oven half hour I’ve read effective. moisture steam cause mask lose structural integrity    No, I've trying find good statistics it. 
 vary highly based demographics infected population. Younger/healthier people (reportedly majority people infected right now) take lot longer go hill end ICU elderly. 

I'm guessing somewhere 1-2 week range average. that's guess based comparing growth curves positive cases ICU admissions several states. agree even though hw win stance made serious thought politics. 

Even people still talking universal basic income. may come fruition people talking especially pandemic. Like, works retail stores restaurants? works government? Sanitation? 

People actually make city work make anywhere near $100k. right. Science say human rights important. Morals ethics do. people never get that. 20%? jumped rent 3000 5200 didn’t lease.

I went small claims got back wouldn’t send new lease 10 emails responding “ok” That's city! I've watching active cases steadily drop last month. Cases really started going days started getting longer (and sunnier!) humidity went back up.

Just comments situation like city:

* Many big office buildings downtown government workers currently working home
* big industry Ottawa tech park Kanata, another industry easy work home
* People really good physically distancing public, people spread cross street get close sidewalk
* Parks open play, playground equipment still limits
* Mask usage great (I'd estimate 30% people grocery stores), Monday they're required public transit
* went dentist morning procedures really good, one client inside time, required masks temperature checks, dentist wearing fit-tested N95
* Restaurants patios recently re-opened (they've takeout last 3 months), think inside still closed 3k month bay area pretty reasonable/cheap. Thats actually exact mortgage answer that.

Salaries generally 150-200k tech (and equity total comp usually closer 300-500k). wife design makes 120 senior level. fuck political??!? top 25% living yachts bunkers dude.  Easy check growing slowly going needs balance outdoor dining large risk. Indoors completely different story please add research paper Guardian article bases debunking collodial silver test? article behind paywall. Orlando idiot follow IG flew San Diego posted using tank top mask plane forgot home. Nonsense.  Exponential growth rate increase -- is, ""new cases"". 

Of course, integral exponential function also exponential function.  So, exponential, either way. This. Everyone know worked nursing homes tried get tested denied. Patients secluded rooms, visitors getting sick pretty obvious staff reason everybody refused test staff.

Reason simple, let staff take sick time off. homes already chronically understaffed staff already calling sick droves. unlikely event attend anime convention probably would choose wear mask.... pandemic not.  mean.. they? Maybe go hikes *because* shit woods agree that. someone going bars hanging friends know risks choose participate. going Walmart grocery different. Masks worn Last debrief watched Dewine showed Ohio decreasing exception Dayton area.

There really Ohio area hit significantly enough though. Cleveland total 5k cases since pandemic began. Even testing order magnitude less 5% infected. Likely less 3% county infected, significant impact spread. True. see useful many levels highschool student though, maybe credit available college students. Colorado first doubled testing, daily cases went 25% day. positivity, I'm convinced single important metric many cases now, dropped. took weeks hunting daily cases started significantly dropping- getting tests done whole time positivity falling steadily. many tests, many sites state paid anyone drive get tested questions asked. got shit together

its* (sorry) Protests? infected issue really misunderstood, want explain Executive Order put place.

First, really important remember nursing homes state run - private corporations paid LOT money take care residents. lots laws regulations need comply maintain license, including able manage properly react infectious disease may afflict facility.

Just like one residents got flu, facility able separate positive negative residents monitor care effectively treat without transmitting virus residents. facilities able manage COVID-19.

However actually happened, facilities started sending residents mild symptoms hospitals refusing readmit found perfectly stable need hospitalized. allowed. Facilities get paid hundreds thousands (often millions) dollars per year turf residents hospitals need hospitalized.

Elderly people often really poorly hospital settings. detrimental wellbeing move unfamiliar environment, ""failure thrive"" common cause death among elderly undergo prolonged hospitalization. important remain place feel comfortable wherever possible.

So, Cuomo issued Executive Order stating nursing homes readmit residents, even positive, long stable health and, importantly, *the facility able care according regulations implemented.*

A facility well within rights transfer resident different facility contact NYS department health say need help, can't take care resident (because enough staff example). Cuomo actively encouraging this, said State either move residents hotels take care, appoint receiver take running facility completely.

Cuomo also announced joint investigation Department Health Attorney General actively investigate every single nursing home NY revoke license compliance. know many Erie County nursing homes already surprise inspections.

However, also worth noting significant number NY nursing homes - including highest death rates - [zero following DOH inspections, even multiple inspections. So, matter facility did, even 100% compliance laws regulations recommendations, virtually impossible keep virus out. So, Cuomo's Executive Order heinous New York Post loves make be, nursing homes inevitable breeding grounds virus.

Edit: Also, [research racial make nursing home biggest factor terms transmission, facility’s history quality care, Nursing Home Compare ratings, non-profit for-profit ownership structure, proportion Medicaid residents bearing likelihood COVID-19 infections.  whose* (sorry) experience eating restaurants mountains north georgia, felt real fear sitting couple benches outside reasonably spaced. still pretty popping even pandemic. IMO little tame sheer amount people allow that. Many things closing, rebound doubt.
It's gonna take time. whatever saw last summer anymore everything closed clubs I'm assuming reopening while.
It's going park doping picnics right now. Please site source saw posting link here. “I see pearly whites..cover choppuhs”. Canadian gov allowed it, good number cases Ontario actually occurred shared dormitories migrant workers live in. 

They're pretty separated society Canadian issue, they're coming province 1.5% hospital capacity use COVID, may actually get better treatment Mexico. Even go grocery store (in normal times too), off-hour. 

They're essential country, grateful people work Canadians could teach people make masks like Czech Republic. read right ? 5k month rent ? Wtf ? Fuck you, cannot even “Drump” comments? Philly? actually read suggesting better countries, looks like worse countries aren’t testing many people are. * I’m fan Trump don’t agree possible Asian countries exactly that?

Jackass. ✌ afford it. in-laws go stores multiple times day! pensions social security Medicare. living best lives.   No. means 2 people 500 tested positive. 

260 unknown number tested people tested positive entire course pandemic, less 0.5% employees. number unrelated 500 people tested. still replied text. I’m comfortable dining restaurants yet. sure since it’s work related. people stay indoors AC it’s absurdly hot well. Right, dilemma in. best friend planned birthday trip beach resort Florida next week tried warn against, continued move forward anyways. weird position one gives shit, feel like bad guy telling rethink it. claim social-distancing pool beach staying away indoor bars. wish governor would close restaurants bars again, won't, people still keep going out. improved internet infrastructure rural America, would really decrease pressure housing bigger cities Definitely! wouldn’t surprised that’s significant factor reducing spread Asia Europe. People NYC unfortunately starting let guard down, too. Sure, may 100% effective, even it’s little bit effective - again, exponential growth crazier think, besides, it’s low effort. I’ve even made enough masks coordinate mine different outfits. Government guidelines specific clear lunatics sub.

Life already lot people minus insane distancing regulations shops. Luckily, people put much stock opinions people call facts ""unfounded rumors."" case Coronavirus, there’s much that’s fundamentally wrong narrative, mention difference opinion usually met idiots ganging regurgitate popular beliefs anti-vaxxers goddamn devil thereby stopping rational discussion taking place.

In previous comment, mentioned vaccinations *forced*, won’t able abstain without suffering major social &amp; legal &amp; even financial consequences.

This likely take form denied access travel, public service infrastructure, even government assistance lockdowns continue oblivion.

In addition, perhaps fundamentally reason, COVID vaccines rushed testing development quality control, extremely non-scientific presumption “things never go back normal vaccine 18 months,” according biggest hype men behind narratives.

Given expressed interest people pushing vaccines hardest ( [*cough* Bill Gates *cough*](corbettreport.com/gates) ) reducing global population use vaccines, it’s extremely suspicious global social agenda compulsory vaccination spearheaded back disease admittedly lethal enough warrant response world-conquest proportions.

Pay attention though, wouldn’t wanna labeled one damned dirty anti-vaxxers now, would ya?  Hey, stop positive! allow here! /s  Chuze fitness go CO maybe 1 10 people wearing masks... lot people around nearly worried COVID-19 month two ago. CO never really got bad one first implement social distancing, lockdown etc got many cases, many doctors even one positive patient. It’s dc it’s pretty common retail location shut since March eCommerce since then. reopen anyone coming store wearing mask period GTFO. owner board parents high risk last thing wants risk bringing Covid-19 them. So, 2-4 weeks longer expected speed sadly picking alot. 2000 dead one day knows many unreported. said, sorry. hope improve soon. good sign. youre wearing masks people street well protected. Also, bodily autonomy become pretty important sudden. It;s great VO2 max training. seriously get tougher, hard cardio mask safer everyone else. Well yeah...pretty sure people dying COVID-19...deaths top pandemic remain usual also endorsed glory holes, prepared happily embrace. wanted know totally new thing already habit this. Asian countries already normal sick, wear mask pass others. hahah nobody asked Local officials need issue mask requirements indoors governor won't. Hopefully churches aware **strictly** apply safety measures, people really follow rules visit. Exactly! Amazing happens country actually comes together one. rare cases though know long term effects majority people, far looks like long recovery people get hit hard part people seem recover little issue, know fully years line. remember started lots people 30 years nd younger collectively confused tried tell parents older siblings please love God STAY HOME laughing cI abuse they'd lived much life saw bullshit news agenda apparently hadn't. . 


There articles even :   bad Epstein already kicked it, then. feel people bit 'meh' Covid now. happening March we'd shutting pants. could lift much Arnold, would want world see. wouldnt home.

Oh come on. expected. open, cases rise degree again. like shit started. point lockdowns quarantines right? blunt first hit dillute cases time.

Also like way. People tired rightfully so. People need economy back track. rightfully so. Life go on. FHM says 60.678 week 24 now. means tests returned positive lower 12%. can't afford totally trust free, mysterious injections nothing bad ever happened before.

Interesting, given answer fucking stupid everyone WH is, can't see breaking rules. XD Cnn articles best sources. saying think it’s wrong. saying think it’s right. right. agree. want see apartments anything like burnt down. However, cannot help feel forced poverty inequality caused superrich leads destruction. think people feel lives matter, children granchildrens lives matter terms guaranteed housing, debt free education health care would thing.
Well happy people riot burn. want working people live dignity NEED fight elite. NEED hold accountable.

Crime much poverty, inwquaity. really care aout inequality crime need adress theur routes. Australia designated hotels 14 day mandatory quarantines anyone arriving overseas. 

There cost benefits outweigh costs (15 people quarantine yesterday confirmed infected Covid-19 city alone). Parks largely remained opened encouraged distancing. could answer question, answer involving one man’s vanity monumental ego would probably get removed. 20 years COVID-19 essentially forgotten. People 30 like ""Oh yeah weird time"". it.

That implies serious making comparison Spanish Flu entirely reasonable - extremely serious pandemic devastating impact around world become significant part history. idea forgotten ridiculous. there's fucking election. citizen Beijing, 90% understanding 10% anger, somewhat inconvenient.

But keeping virus control, 3 weeks bring new boost zero, keep tragedy happening places.

It's worth it. Also couple got let quarantine compassionate grounds funeral ran away days authorities found them. Classic NZ. Sinovec's vaccine going revealed soon too.

Lol Gross, took bait. RES add on???

We’re labeled “troll” automatically u? That’s awesome Better trust Wire, history running paid journalism. source money investigated. funniest part is: easy predict future. still people want believe fairy tail virus control. country could accomplish that. Coronavirus red. /r/intermittentfasting open article there's photo near bottom two ladies, apparently friends, wearing masks...under chins, mouths noses completely exposed.

This virus continues spread. people refuse even wear mask properly. remember years ago seriously considering moving US UK start new life.

Today: oh FUCK no. place disaster zone  hardly called escape got compassion exemption leave quarantine? Yeah every state went thing states get point they're now, amount deaths country would staggering. took PA lowest deaths per capita 5 mentioned averaged across entire US (which would mean 4 states mentioned already would less deaths actually do), 496 deaths/1 million people, we'd roughly 163,000 deaths right 44,000 higher actually are.

If took extreme applied NY's 1,593 deaths/1 M, would 522,000 deaths right now. point, even nothing, cases would start decline naturally simply herd immunity. states level yet? Perhaps judging sheer amount deaths per capita relative lot states, percentage people still left infected, going smaller. country, we're sitting 360 deaths/1 means states listed, range anywhere 38% 443% average. 12 states DC exceed national average (and Indiana's .8% average). means they've really skewed average good way.

If wanted generous possible ignoring actual figures generalizing relative states, way look would go population size. state ""about average"" would match pretty close terms population size deaths. NY 4th largest state 1st deaths. NJ 11th largest 2nd deaths. 15th largest 4th deaths. IL 6th largest 8th deaths. PA 5th largest 9th deaths. Even metric, actual per capita figures go by, PA IL could said exceeding expectations. NJ even close be. NY would average. Called it. Memorial Day everyone broke rules. pay, lives. Yes, much possible. fucking retards. true? I’d love references any. googled someone mentioned exercises mask things cursory reading seeemed say it’s myth. I’d love mask actually making stronger somehow go walks. accused hoarding worse capitalizing pandemic personal gain. I’m bartender (or was) North Jersey (Jersey city) I’ve decided I’m going return Bartending multiple medical conditions imagine stuck behind bar 12 hours 4-6 different waves people sit eat front me, facing me, laughing talking loudly without masks (because well eating meals) don’t imagine I’ll well conditions. Mortality ethics subjective.

And no, obligated keep attire line someones desires. really sounds like Iranian religion police tier. Arnie leading way. Ok.... really try also call 2 people eating patio? really saying wear mask eating?! That's moral like 2/3 stories. much point that? Like I'm running, I'd put thing I'd probably end running bit slower. take off, could speed pace point breathing difficult, except legs getting benefit running faster. I'm sure I'm missing something, first glance see mask would better increasing intensity. Yeah, must say NZ impressive, really impressive. I'm guessing balance government mandated (competent) policies level accountability action, populace following policies (for part). kind need both. mean immune response happen due Covid virus directly think wavelength comes semantics describe it. TL;DR: Tuesday, researchers Oxford University released details clinical study, thousands patients random given commonly-available steroid Dexamethasone 10 days.

Unfortunate deal bunch idiots though Ask Lacent that. bright side, second wave keep riding first wave forever. THEY'RE INVINCIBLE!
Yelling comments makes right, it? 😉 serious? need spoon fed you? 

N95s reserved health care workers extreme shortage them. Reserve respirators medical staff.

If medical worker duty, wear mask. Data shows effective mask wearing public decrease cases _75%_. That's masks alone, N95+ respirators.

From sounds it, medical worker spouting nonsense? Astonishing. Turn scrubs.  time. place since March reason people don’t understand this. virus deadly say debilitating survive it, every mayor governor signed permits protests blood hands. not, can’t people beach go park playground. can’t ways, consistency creates lot questions, anger unrest. piss poorly managed one way another..: sure way yet. Anything inside way. ""You encouraged consider United States alliance.""

That's partially true say, also hard accept Chinese person another perspective. I'll give example US 25% policy towards China uniformly enforced across states, unusual seen one Chinese. Ok guys, close Harvard. reddit expert longer believes legitimate. Masks. Social distancing. Allow work form home. come office way always it. Internet backbone hold up. Technology support it. Redisn person jobs. large gatherings especially indoors. Non would kill economy. disruption good harm. Hate see I've pandemic twice. TWICE. 

I living Korea end February year, scrambled home beginning peak there. barely made border shutdown took place March 6th. 

I've making sure cover whole time, self-quarantined came back, go groceries.

Little know would goddamn willfully ignorant whole thing. 

This stupid fuck went TV said ""We know happened county judge enforced mask worn, woman ended jail""

He referencing Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins stupid salon owner Karen opened business publicly tore restraining order 3 days lockdown lifted. 

Keep mind *stupid idiot* one made executive order lockdown everything, salons included. 

The judge enforcing standard governor agreed terms Dallas regards masking up. 

He audacity go TV throw judge bus taking legal action woman knowingly openly broke law goddamn executive order violated. 

He blamed mask issue, reality sent jail violating shelter-in-place orders, can't even get accusations right. 

He's also one decided move 75% reopening despite spikes cases hospitalizations quickly rising well.

And, came TV today say ""If get sick, worry, got plenty beds.""

He's basically saying ""Go ahead sacrifice retail taxes get back order. get sick die, oh well.""

And today went about, many people without masks disturbing. 

We're fucking stupid, I'm beginning sincerely hope wave devastating teach us lesson. LOL.

No way taking rushed vaccine virus 99.9% chance surviving. Sure they're worried, worried free Nike's TVs grabs though. love people getting gardening now. Every time go favorite local nursery lots customers (safely distancing) common flowers unusually hard track year. makes hopeful know people trying create beauty lives neighborhoods. weird looters getting sick Northern Illinois - suburbs Chicago Fine, telling, earth chosen play role tatooine Exactly, air escape gaps even properly worn surgical masks much larger gaps valved N95 respirators. surgical masks loose fitting cloth masks recommended, see valved respirators excluded.

Not mention large proportion public wear surgical masks loose fitting cloth masks improperly nose wide gaps sides. pushing false narrative disease affects people already sick. need convince us normal people ignore it. Why? bad business bad image government anything america control. arresting people coughing others? I’m new healthcare field, probably know much me. trained always wear surgical masks go airborne precaution rooms. I’ve read multiple studies saying masks really help spread stopping. don’t see encouraging people wear masks could possibly good idea. same(ish) principle can't safely vaccinated. people can't medically take certain precautions. preclude participating society without good reason.

 (I someone present doctor's note yet. Probably people would able get doctor's note risk self isolating much can.) people live look crazy wearing them. stay indoors harder now. Happy Cake day, county went 6 240 ( climbing?) less 1 week. needs case study ready go back normal things. may done areas temporarily like works, still actively spreading many regions. work infectious disease research, way general public immediately gone back normal definitely concerning.  People starting travel again, hanging large groups, wearing masks, resuming every day life nothing happened. plan start reopening businesses safely social distancing rules place, people seem interpreted reopening virus gone. Unfortunately, inevitably see large resurgence infections. 2020 longass century. see campaign ads twisting quote: ""Re-elect prevented second wave happening"" anyone seen stats spikes protests. any?

I haven’t. what’s magical substance air protests?  That’s sister’s name. pissed complain both. it? actually referring second half statement... ""most people going recover fully.""  friend mine volunteered. She’s PhD candidate UK happened stuck China time. wrote diary sorts (in Chinese). 

But that’s obviously much propaganda I’ll see out.  ""You encouraged think United States coalition many nations.""

That's partially true say, also hard accept Chinese person another perspective. I'll give example, US tariff policy towards China uniformly enforced states, unusual seen one Chinese. recession, rent almost always rises demand rentals goes fewer people able qualify buy home. time MIGHT different depression/correction artificially created, doubt it. many 104 million already infected?

This roughly 1/3rd entire US population we’re talking here. else equal would expect see roughly 650k severe COVID-19 illnesses US, isn’t data reflecting. Good job leaving brutal assassination he's made emperor, totally would put foot mentioned short Avril Lavigne sub plot leading horrible horrible death. Ah yes, Patriots. People chomping bit mow fellow countrymen crime. NEED GOFUNDME THIS.

If idiot make $50,000 open restaurant, get fined fraction got paid, shut back again, union definitely get anonymous funding risk lives. state better disease gone southern border Mexico. r/freefolk  relax lil silly goose except Taiwan Hong Kong talking behavior, agree could cause huge problems. 

If there's huge uptick hanging around indoors fall, sure, cases skyrocket. BALLS!!!! Stop bitching, wear mask wash hands. Pretty simple game plan imo, know people asking souls. morning, large number employees Elite Comfort Solutions plant Herring Road refused go work concerns plant wasn’t cleaned properly co-worker tested positive COVID-19.   estimated 50 people left.   
 
   pandemic, plant shut week several employees tested positive. One elderly employee later passed away, two still undergoing physical therapy part recovery illness, according employees.  one worker tested worker’s close relative tested positive. worker’s boyfriend, lives also works facility, continued coming work girlfriend’s test came back positive, according employees. found positive test Sunday night.  
  say company started providing masks weeks ago, employee passed away. employee sick several weeks.   that, told us way could get mask sick symptoms go home,” another employee said. Now, employees get temperature checked reporting work.   employee said want informed going on, make decisions health based circumstances.   
  
Fuck place That's gonna become tsunami 😣 Ugh yes. Properly timed hand sanitizer better gloves way!!! Mostly disease send away Mexico 🇲🇽 continued infect poor Mexicans. America would safe border wall goes overprotected.  essentially true though. wear mask someone else doesn't, mouth nose covered eyes, ears, open healing wounds skin exposed. Also pick anything cough/sneeze touch coughing/sneezing/blowing nose hands help cover. preventing spread still susceptible various ways.

If people wear masks correctly, prevent large portion likely exit point virus (mouth nose) exposing others anything carrying.

I say healthcare professional prior roles research labs, clinical labs, ICU, urgent care training people use universal precautions, correct handwashing technique, use PPE least 10 15 years working healthcare settings.

Also, use gloves, cleanable eye protection, disposable head covers whenever possible patients concerning symptoms. Gowns preferred unavailable, make sure clothes change end shift ok sanitizer ""bath"" unable shower prior putting new clothes leaving workplace. mean like MSF doctors etc get killed vaccination programs?

in different timeline I'd said ""don't silly, could never happen America""..... Covid 

Congrats. found typo. Argument invalidated technicality. win. Emperor Canada! sounds awes- dies unceremoniously polar bear attack leaving three plotholes seven lose ends. think human nature. mean 600k+ died Spanish flu pandemic. surprised thing. unfortunately protested must go revolution. fear many hospitalized worst death becos it. knew risk. Except actually anything prepare lockdown open everything back normal delay reason. GG PA chance? We’ve really opened last weeks (about week half restaurants). 

Another spike might convince some, others still deny, deny, deny. report released recently said many lives saved lockdowns, Tucker Carlson ranting definitive proof lockdowns nothing. course didn’t. proof places didn’t lockdown didn’t see surge. Um Sweden, anyone? Things going great there, right? crowded indoor environments closed operating seriously reduced capacity. 

Have spent time large downtown office building recently? went mine couple weeks ago middle would busy workday. people saw people Starbucks lobby. decided get pastry like customer they’d seen hours. four asked wanted anything else. felt like Twilight Zone episode. *Laughs properly fitted N95*

But yeah you’re right general. really see many ""Obese"" people got way packing muscle

Right, probably see obese people simply realize ""obese"". people talking look obese muscular probably *actually* obese. 

Obesity issue US, I'm miles away denying that. Although, despite that, problem bloated BMI. even example one people high school, 5'11 220lbs. 

I certainly overweight, body fat 21%. is, definition, obese. Still overweight still issue, obese. 

If saw me, think obese. wearing big shirt even thought overweight. 

Anyway, digress. Point problem, bad might think. Silver lining. making inferences without correlation. factually true people died COVID WW1. offered here. genocide American lives occurred WW1? genocide occurring COVID decided bring comparison even?  Let’s entertain notion though; I’ll ask this;  
What level unemployment USA 1917? 
What average cost medical care 1917?
What level income disparity 1917?  
What level daily life changes average American 1917?  
Did average American fear lives simply leaving homes? Deaths gone hell. I'm sorry complete utter bullshit. People wearing masks give fuck anyone anything else.  let get away feigning ignorance. purposeful putting us danger need called it. Indeed. really loved visiting New England. Western favorite reminded home way less pollution. married someone CT. hates culture shock. lot anti-science anti-education sentiment. I'm working graduate degree hope get doctoral program leave. Brain drain real here. travellers Canada US mainland easing access roads trade, private vehicles border checkpoints. also, hell cancel gym membership? need, like, certified letter, two witnesses, stamped Pope it. say 120K/day died. said that's wants.

What exactly point? busy factoids see big picture? two died. I'll see outside years then, going away anytime soon.  plan stop spread, never really was.  government botched that. spent 60+ leaving anything food, years. dont get this. virus war relatable. “Or government organizing testing contract tracing” - Fauci’s fault, know come part script CCP gives you? According manufacturer, Taping otherwise covering respirator valve voids regulatory approval may impact respirator functions. 3M recommend altering respirators worn purpose reducing wearer exposure airborne hazards. rally goer's partier's anything say it.... kinda fucks head it? many people opposite almost makes question legitimacy beliefs even though know youre right this. Stores thing Okay. got me. I'm going start believing dumbass now.  Red MAGA N95 masks could end saving millions lives.

And Trump would wear one, once. hope get kidney transplant One biggest reasons left... unfortunately family ""the people"" referring to. Pretty close unfortunately leader martial law protest. would.bring military. anything believe conspiracy anyone speak Fauci? guy changed position weekly pandemic. That’s messed cases rising 920,000 completely fucked disease. agree. should’ve mentioned NYC 1st comment point we’re still declining even # protesters out. think biggest factor attitude. NYC hit hardest, know seen effects virus take guidelines seriously. We’re also given daily briefings facts/data everyday. us get tested free especially protesters urged test isolate. Even Staten Island majority Republicans, know tests, masks take distancing seriously.

To many outside NYC, it’s like distant event; don’t think Covid affect them. It’s frustrating pandemic become left vs right issue virus preference. blame leaders choosing $ hold power people’s lives. It’s hard folks take precautions they’re getting mixed messages government. news yesterday, girl FL thought Covid over, went bar friends 15 caught virus. singling young people? Every age group acting like jackass comes mask usage. Canada goose emblazoned mask, eh. 

Not even kidding. sarcastic, yes nothing Abbott course. stations talking left wing protests saying it’s awesome there’s risk, 


Which station hear on? making stuff up? KN95 masks actually restrict airflow surgical masks. Many people area wear KN95 bought online months ago. apparently [firefighters use restrict airflow either. Wait arnold full gym house? Noise probably another factor--slaughterhouses loud enough communicating often requires loud speaking yelling, significantly increases amount virus moving around. extreme right-wing media usually link to? i.e. paying justice system make pesky white collar crimes go away. Bakker sells plastic buckets folding shovels $100 concerned they're gonna able take crap Apocalypse. push heavy loaded cart walking fast mask. can't imagine hard must take care little children days. hand, reason give up.

I'm also worried growing racism asian partly asian people. lot people hometown (Vienna) blame chinese people whole SARS-CoV-2, hear every day, none protesters activists talking that, black people could become victims racism. ridiculous. Kosher: probably

Halal: maybe

Vegan: all

Ok Hindus: imagine assuming well last year, feel cold rise infection rates solely people closer together know guy tested positive couple months negative. doctors really sure him. showed lighter symptoms second time around, last nearly long (like expect something immune system recently seen), know enough say whether would contagious. He's quarantine safe side. whole ""probably contagious"" thing really dicey, I'd imagine doctors would tell play safe either way. word salad point? NZ citizens. NZ still closed non-citizens. going totally believe info coming President USA. Lol okay. numerous states USA opening back up, yet are. Obviously also places USA open numbers low enough. saying OPs original comment, reason things opening try support economy. opening 'safe'. Yet many people think means reopening. I'm sure trying argue I'm stating information widely available. USA opening back (too quickly areas) support economy COVID free. Or, lock 100 cases, also abtain 80k. thinking along lines young kids going class, sharing covid other, coming home getting parents sick, go work get co-workers sick.

but colleges going concern well folks come over. 

the change season new bugs folks cause people get sick time year anyway. bump covid schools go back session. much bump is....well that's us. Let's question let's hope really reaching here. claim CDC incorrect, ignoring facts, making emotional decisions absurd. 

The studies ""facts"" referencing taken context debunked. Simple cloth masks, worn proximity others, present none hazards according accredited medical professionals. 

Its clear influenced reason. references emotional responses rights reveals actual facts relevance worldview. 

It must comforting feel better take illness pandemics trained professionals. However attitude, much like antivax nuts, make world dangerous responsible adults. Seriously. Alcohol withdrawal joke going cold turkey fuck alcoholic bad way getting COVID would symptoms severe enough. agree it’s myth think what’s happening Arizona Florida it’s hot they’re gathering indoors AC full blast that’s good recipe COVID spread. even virus can’t take heat, neither humans AC option. People already making except wearing (breathing difficulties, asthma) feel like murderers wearing one.

This would encourage nasty behaviour. protest

pro test Vast number People traveling today covid deniers significant financial exposure must travel. Either case hear flight attendant relative flies it’s 50% wearing masks. Arnold Weißenegger? would snowbirds go back Midwestern states weather starts get worse? know term snowbird means? Agreed. Upvoted you. Freedom means: willing die show loyalty Maximum Leader. cool people dying think people you. ""Now gonna want make Hebrew Star one point missing, symbolize Jesus. one point missing symbolizes Hebrews missing King."" comparing 1% mortality civilian deaths explicable reason 

No, inexplicable. comparing risk dying C-19 risk dying hands US Military. case risk dying C-19 much lower. 

You comparing risk dying C-19 make comparison order emphasize individual perception risk face similar odds. 

You also use examples make comparison risk death Covid compared risk death caused US military wars. 

We may different reasons making comparisons negate fact comparisons used emphasis point. either points relevant neither are. win debate simply saying 'my point relevant isn't'. Yeah BC here. I'm keen high population joining low population flooding us politically. Americans value individual freedom individual rights responsibilities much community rights responsibility all. manifests differences taxes, also schools, hospitals, municipalities, policing law run--everybody suing everybody, nobody following rules unless suits them.  money That’s blatant lie. way anything less 85-90% went like 12 different protests. same. :Texas: 

Hold beer Can't foreign terrorist taking jobs domestic terrorists, confederate loving traitor then? must watching news then. 

I'm half-way across globe know large proportion people US wear masks.

Anyway, suppose social aspect perhaps Arnold enjoys it. personally don't, that's me. “I breath mask on!”

While continue drink mountains soda eat nasty Costco hot dogs pizza Insert Slaughterhouse 5 reference. yesterday. means anti-Trump narrative pursue can't see much worse Biden is. New York, mine went $20 No? You’re making up, experts said anything like this. really fall object permanence, belief logical fallacy?

AFAIK, object permanence able tell something goes sight thing next time see it. actually relevant question Jewish, Islamic, Indian people. Extremely gravest. really, no. dead really matter died, it? Dead dead. Mask usage 50% I’d say. working theory way people actually got reported, many immune don’t know it.  Desperate what? Pretty sure people moon thinking crime? given exemption. So, legitimately believe absolutely ignorant CNN reader already knows important info. Riiiiiiiight. That's dont absolute moron running country. Another politician hated office turns actually decent human being. Way go Arnold. I’ll think next time I’m Arnold’s lol. Yeah that's right, also migrates winter hibernates summer. worry restrictions, right /s Dang, know market got lucky. $15 increase years rented increase years. common sense dude. tests = cases. long last? age well it?

The model highly accurate exponential phase. model effects lockdowns peak infections, instead meant approximate true amount infections due limited testing.

What wrote precisely happened. would read whole thing... Could simple less serious strain prevalent Wisconsin serious strain prevalent Florida/Texas/Arizona? LOLOLOL also hospitals every part country, bud? Pointing outliers evidence argument pretty stupid. normal circumstances, restrictions, come across small fraction number people lived downtown area taking public transit. cant direct comparison easily 2 different environments. Good luck keeping common man/woman committed long term plan greater good. need ass, saying would bad taste politician. Yep. easiest, arguably single effective prevention measure 😐 worried. friends believe act life normal. almost willing hang outdoors, traveling, I’m not. job (working children) took safety measures day (I’m working now). church services person although “limited” people. Yesterday Vice President said everything fine media spreading lies. fortunate need income, I’m glad family home together, it’s freaking bizarre. people really still think hotter climates equal protection virus??? First want say really besides point. point untruthful. Whether gaslighting lying crowd journalists people home main concern.

However, yes. I'd say example denying speeding form gaslighting since trying undermine officer's perception were.

If hand met officer dinner party claimed never driving fast entire life (even though have), that'd lie, since trying undermine someone's perception reality (he got clue ever driving speed limit - perception fact. Either pro against.)

If dinner party instead talked officer said driving fast speed limit crashed ditch couple years back, later evening say, officer, never speeding life. he/she says ""huh, told crashed car last year due speeding?!"" answer ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. gaslighting sure.

There lot people remember Tegnell claiming herd immunity possible without vaccine. later date claims always saying herd immunity impossible without vaccine, undermining perception everyone clearly remembering otherwise. According that's sort gaslighting, rather call lying, that's perfectly fine me. british paper though? one knows exactly why. theories people staying indoors air conditioning. virus also little bit stochastic strikes, lightning strike brush 25 times nothing happens 26th time starts fire burns hectares. virus. Nationwide lockdown probably delayed start put early fires. took little fires start again. Covid spread super spreaders fact tens hundreds people mass gatherings. strangely enough someone household disease contract yet someone attend church gathering singing infect 48 people. 

It's really predictable short run, extremely predictable long run exponential growth eventually happen. lot like fire starting fire. Nursing homes, prisons, meat packing plants, congregate facilities kindling. fire burns ""kindling"" slowly burns population less susceptible living place sharing bathroom. disease reaches critical mass exponential growth begin, critical mass happens.

If look, Iran experiencing second wave. lifted restrictions April 5th saw nothing decreasing cases three entire weeks saw increases. experiencing exponential growth. infomercial juicer guy seemed pretty ripped, think Arnold could take him. Improving then. /s really think distinguish indoors restaurants places outdoors parks. There’s big difference environments. let ask this: people still wearing masks there? people generally wear masks city, ive hung times outdoors establishment serves alcohol...

the protest took part good mask usage. 100 percent, easily 75 80 percent would eyeball.

reopening businesses crushed one thing.....but think need keep wearing masks indefinitely. kosher? don’t want responsible need step let someone take place I'm proud that's problem, that's majority population gets media well aware fact. throw segment random time fear virus spread. see Lemon prime time talking he's worried protests spreading virus. Oklahoma governor told nursing homes start opening visitation. Right it’s discretion personally don’t think long it’s mandated. I’m also wondering long someone sue us requiring masks times refusing entry won’t comply. 

Several facilities know opened immediately. we’re apparently running squabbles doctors aren’t using requiring masks distancing office appointments. 

This whole thing sucks. likely won’t far behind states especially upcoming rally recent protests. feels like we’re forced watch people die preventable deaths. figured based decent video resolution political references Vic Berger edits he's recent. put bodies somewhere. used law Arkansas prohibited mispronunciation name Arkansas. punishable jail time. lose neurological effects easily. pick years later make rapids gains this. shit masks causing issues complete bullshit man. Surgeons nurses wear masks 8-12 hours day. 
After weeks maybe month get used it.


If lungs compromised wearing mask kill you, state working - especially cardio. probably hospital home. partially correct.  Testing always available; even accurate cases. Yes, false-positives thing RELIABLE test kits widely available. Best guess used cases available testing, reliable. That's true. seems rare article cites South Korean study finds vestiges original virus upon retesting later seems evince second positive probably contagious. fair Scopes Monkey Trial happened Murdoch. build something. case, large anti-science sentiment already existed. I’m old remember wanted sue state Ohio allowing spectators Arnold classic, going ignore order Ohio informed would shut whole thing arrest people. 

Oh wait, mid March. Apparently not, can’t tell many disgusting people see restrooms getting stall walking hand washing. I’m glad taught proper hygiene school It’s possible, I’m convinced that’s why. think people tired willing ignore precautions they’re inconvenient. also fraction people. also live much closer guys.

We also thousands cases even one.

What even talking about? pretty clear US administration lot population suck handling Corona. 

I run numbers, things considered, Germany handling Corona pretty much best. 100+? 

100+ horrible number, enough panic whole country.

Not country strong nerve America. interesting, articles posts dig deeper historical parallels Chinese emperors? think aversion talking phone/video chat general causes anxiety. Talking issues general makes self conscious talking phone opens whole new worms. I'm really place relax say want without overheard people house family always ""we air dirty laundry"" sort mentality I'd rather potentially listening in. I'm afraid we're getting cocky Colorado. confirm Cozy relationship employment contract  Aww man. fucking robot dogs terrifying. accept become obligation... ask thing? exact point goes ""nah cold flu, fucks given"" ""end world upon us, everybody masks on!!"" feels like education thing US. 

Even reddit theoretically relatively educated knowledgeable base users, see much ignorance everywhere. 1.) That’s illegal 
2.) true, wouldn’t mean “work for” Pharma work Discover give cash back purchases. Payment employment contract.

 1 takes virus serious protects people around well despite infamous reopening.

 second group listens Trump others replicate Trump says. Trump says wearing masks unnecessary virus cold, take serious even stretch odds. Bonus points tried inject bleach.

A third group ones suffer American social system. Americans ment sit ass wait deadly virus. American economy works people working. that's supposed do, virus not. 15% unemployment rate guarantee people re-hired perfectly shows broken American economy is. Yet people would rather protest re-opening protest favor first-world social system. I’ll carry gun wear mask! think part people see almost everyone interact completely disregarding sort preventative measure, give up. right. Sorry shouldn’t spoken protests. ones Boston permits start. I, don’t know. 

[Boston Hmm, interpretation mesh direct quote former California governor ""will stay clear Gold's people start wearing masks floor — there's vaccine,"" TMZ said.

So yes, planning come back.. people start wearing masks there's vaccine. title seems spot-on. Less 2 millions CHF (less 2 millions euros) Swiss one. I’m convinced God hates evangelicals allow Trump go untouched sink country Modesty laws lefties ;) wow massive anti-china bias south korea taiwan. i'm living SK right now. much news going on. high fear negative media US. actually, since countries viewed handled situation negatively, kind makes sense. China starting US currently doing. 

I think also goes hand hand with, china's actual capabilities dealing virus, high perception begin with, US global leader mishandling situation living potential. 

But back february, regular people swearing president, asking new leadership jazz, italy overtook korea number 1 corona virus hotspot local citizens began realize korea actually responded well. US became number 1, support government began lol lol, genius seemingly unique phenomenon US caring something affects oneself and/or kin. covers embarrassingly large fraction population. people haven’t closely affected, it’s mind. Meanwhile, another large fraction us live constantly stay away people. mean part due unions pensions SWA really pay yet. Shit...I'm sorry personally think civil war. since Americans cant let anything go, gonna civil war lasts like 2 decades like war Afghanistan. 2 decade hemmorage country breaks Trump like villain movie hero dog. health officials communicating recommendations often enough. 

Recommendations wear masks keep social distance, need communicated clearly, concisely, often enough everyone hears several times every day.  

Children, general public, need told every day, once.  Short attention spans, easily distracted, that. 

Most people told, told.  catchy jingle would help. still wont' care. He's going admit he's wrong. Ever. !RemindMe 1/1/2021 morons world, US, morons think know better often put charge. Honestly realized Pandemic coming thought Trump GOP get slam dunk re-election. act half competent pretend care lives. couldn’t even pretend that. couldn’t help try steal everything nailed down. L3fties. Allways telling others do, allways demanding others comply wishes allways surprised offended met refusal. actually based nothing sense lockdowns kept virus running rampant, making much happen, exactly wanted. Maybe people bored period nothing, returning normal life. soon react fully realized disaster. Avoid garage &amp; problem solved blame Governor. mean tried it? say caused virus (SARS-CoV-2), talking disease causes (COVID-19). Seems like splitting hairs seeing person indeed talking virus disease, mistake. med school teach us particular terms use also people aren't, makes semantics much difficult I've woken up. yes, think core agree.  I'm wondering point obligation? No, read part article again. It’s form Q&amp;A author answering question regarding possible seasonal temporary deer processing. author states, “while seasonal deer processing exciting proposition, I’m afraid folks considering option missing scale problem...no deer processor I’m aware could put dent number.” saying switch deer meat ineffective way trying improve upon processing meat. Viruses use things love turn weapons us. socializing in-person, beating virus. Definition community spread according Meriam Webster dictionary:

“the spread contagious disease individuals particular geographic location known contact infected individuals recently traveled area disease documented many state governments confirmed 1 (to put mildly) case can’t trace source infection.

And far prime minister giving pressers, India’s probably worst crisis right history prime minister courage face questions give unscripted answers puts skills ability handle situation doubt.
You remember media 4th pillar democracy PM totally avoiding direct questions puts big question mark behind respecting values democracy idea India. GTFO. Go backwoods hole Thoreau up. become part society, things ask you. Like keep dick pants wear goddamn mask pandemic. Sometimes hate reddit much title little misleading. read thinking ""Arnold walked wear mask?"" I'm glad case.

I'm saying wearing mask working breathing hard fun, gyms rated RIGHT bars salons virus transfer. Gotta careful. primitive cultures always behave. Science threatens worldview, reject angrily.  Whether they're burning ""witches"" cured people using herbal meds, locking Galileo house arrest saying Earth center universe, rebel logic, intelligence, education. 

It always there, lying muck bottom pond. Corona floated surface see it.  poke people face pretty easily, sometimes eye. Umbrellas also break they’re easy forget bus. face poking worst. problem people jerks saying ""I can't wear one health issues"" health issue pride, stupidity belief viral FB posts. best democracy money buy. bad us worse gets, supporters like him. hope mutant inspired people come make sure he's back fit another term. consider patriot gotten realize need emigrate US. Way many stupid people. It’s severely broken. daily death toll high backlog ? Yes, much. Apparently. pay go FL right now. proper argument leave life fucking along. That's ever asked. NZ case nothing social distancing rules NZ. would case suddenly community transmission case. NZ situation nothing like China. safe work retail store? called back work bit panic it. Employees required wear masks customers not. :/ purposeful. people got fired wanting lie data. know unrealistic, ideally state borders would monitored too. states taking seriously ballooning control. someone holiday state that's well... we'll never get this, we? point people would scared shitless even go out. so, donning full enviro suit.

Luckily contagious airborne virus less 1% death rate across whole population, kinda changes game. University (37,000+ students) modeling found long test 40% campus population month catch outbreak hits 30 people. course strong contact tracing program. test 60% campus population keep outbreak 20 people. dropped single digits hit 70%. 

So yeah, regular testing good contact tracing feasible control outbreaks. 

Of course contact tracing program includes sign sheets buildings cases specific rooms.

They still ramping program, university size White House problem keeping track went met. also POTUS, lot people protecting him. guarantee small squad people follow like toddler, disinfecting everything walks squirting hand sanitizer, telling keep orange hands away face, etc.

Also, give time: dude hold reelection rally indoors, basically requesting exposed follows that. Ah, see watched Idiocracy documentary :P Lots us care. ones already responsible. don’t know reach others. Tell Trump. Maybe he'll restart Coronavirus task force actually work problem. Let's riot loot stop it. Better test trying test might really ill. good know may exposed start getting sick, know is. Good know need isolating prevent loved ones getting it. think that's right. Studies shown outdoors, far less likely get it.

Most dangerous inside family members extended periods. article wants use deer substitute beef, last thing need perfect scenario chronic wasting disease's prions finds host dna cornavirus. NZ waterlocked nation 5 million people, spread out. America multiple urban centers larger populations NZ. expecting, fair compare two? one main ways COVID kills causing acute organ failure? Notice actually proper argument. given health risks involved moment, facemasks rules public make far sense keeping everyone's dick contained. society arbitrarily decided dicks, vaginas boobs must covered, seems acceptable you, actual medical reason keep people's faces covered act like ready throw tea harbor. Lol. 1918 Spanish flu anti-mask movement also. People changed much since then. Oh dead. read interesting story high altitude high school soccer team Peru would routinely go valley areas trounce competition. living high like 11,000 12,000 ft training altitude. went valleys closer sea level, like running oxygen masks on. basically would never get tired.

So yeah seems thing, although I'm sure whether masks would even close effect acclimated continuously high altitudes like that. I'm rural north Florida seeing maybe, guess, 5% people wearing masks that. People generally courteous though give space.  different kind masks. cheap/selfmade (and poor fitting) stuff suited catch virusladen droplets keeping air suspended viruses out... Exactly! Keep head people! know everyone tired lockdown, please take recommended precautions. scary federal gov't thrown towel discussing COVID-19, let fool you. DT tried downplay whole issue since started. Meanwhile, virus continues ravage country. obvious take care one another beat thing. part well everybody. general curiosity lets say highly contagious airborne virus 85% mortality rate. point people obligated wear masks outside? Viral load likely substantially higher most. Especially early repeated exposure it. It’s sad replace umbrella bicycle. I'm sure riding bicycle looked silly first — imagine seeing first time. riding bicycle look weird scary people days. Wearing mask still seems to, western people. thinking Biden? Churches death traps. Die Menschen sind nicht böse, die Menschen sind nur dumm.

People evil, people dumb second wave? shit never stopped first place. one long wave it’s well intentioned doesn’t mean it’s tyranny.

So stop red traffic light, feel oppressed goverment? Also stated first wave 1918 flu killed mainly elderly younger, healthier people recovered easily. second third wave everything went crazy alot information others saying accurate second third wave. I'm expecting Covid-19 go crazy second third wave know handled. far advanced back also still making lot mistakes. doesn't. shows stupid. would perfect seal around mouth, masks, especially ones see people wearing aren’t going give people that. percentage carbon monoxide breath escaping. You’ll fine. Florida, that's answer We’re testing anyone... 

Seriously sub exist lol totally agree statement. one ones started getting annoyed pandemic stuff seeing people wearing mask brought back reality started wearing myself. Even though sometimes forget try best cover mouth nose tissue shirt whatever else find car. Since there's lot dubious info this, details two women (presumably sisters) travelled NZ visit dying parent, [BBC may infected people transit NZ, unlikely gave sundry women - one 30s one 40s - arrived New Zealand UK 7 June, via Doha Brisbane, entered stayed managed isolation hotel Auckland 12 June applied exemption visit dying parent - died later granted permission travel Wellington 13 One women ""mild symptoms"", put pre-existing travelled Wellington private vehicle use public facilities journey, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, director-general health, said stayed single family member Wellington. family member placed self-isolation. 

Part wincing fun detail British. Yeah, would -- reinforcing (pretty fair) international image vat contagion piloted moronic pseudo-Churchill. wonder contact tracing done work picked virus UK, whilst travelling NZ. Murphy’s law means matter hard try everything right, something go wrong. longer case wrong things knowingly. 

The protests shutting economy also issues direct public health implications - unless think going hungry, shut house months psychological problems might cause, etc. affect public health.

I'm American, American politics direct effect me, read riots - compared Trump seems like voice reason. Bring downvotes. can't rustle cattle slaughter, toughens meat. don’t. No, that's cool. better him. flu isnt credited every death pneumonia thing kills person flu. Comparing death totals two silly dont credit all. Unlike you, looked. close 50% according this: part broader social engineering scheme, channel society’s collective moral outrage easily manipulated, practically meaningless political movement fizzle quickly, also building narrative second wave social crackdown, stripping civil liberties narrowing flow information available internet new-normal boogeyman rolls back around, supposedly without nudging along special interest groups stand reap kind benefit omnipresence.

Why else would big corporate media decide pull complete 180 give sweet, sticky coverage corporate-funded, race-baiting BLM bullshit, literally within span hours, Coronavirus hottest topic trending world moments before?

It’s obvious bait-and-switch, firmly supported reality people fall like dominoes whatever they’re told “experts” television social media, also whatever mindlessly emotional narrative shoved face, long it’s shoved fast enough force don’t take time actually consider ramifications they’re agreeing go along with.

It worked easily pandemic narrative first place, seeing it’s widely reported COVID far less deadly public originally frightened believing, yet agendas still rolled speak.

Forced vaccination? Check.

Increased surveillance? Check.

Restriction free movement internal checkpoints? Check.

Greater censorship internet? Check.

*Nah, don’t fret whatsoever topics. get protest — it’s rage everybody’s it!*

At point, based current situation played conveniently every major social engineering agenda envisioned past century, really begs question whether COVID also engineered released intent highly desirable range effects future human society.

Unfortunately, goals round social engineering already slotted place premeditated, disastrous economic effects forced shutdowns made record profits big business running mom pop town straight grave, care haircuts racist suggest anything contrary. You’re correct count separate events (north south) we’re still top 5 Maybe prisoners Governor Abbot said irresponsible 20 somethings.

Regardless, whether prisoners young people certain nothing Governor Abbott masks.  I’m gonna waste time, go look around allowed country. toughened another virus present ..!! dead people really sick, would dead end year regardless /S "" reality hit small number places. coming city county near you."" 

Sorry like fear mongering sentences. 

I disagree article. virus stay. sentence people sick if. Give science behind data that's it. need personal commentary. Especially experts wrong often. Thought experiment: throw preconceived notions coronavirus. Imagine time traveled year ago learned pandemic. would interpret NYT 

For first thing jumps cases per 100k column. states 1,000 sustained downswing. seems like roughly 500 tipping point case growth falls. Maybe closer 1000 high density states closer 300 lower density states. friends tested positive bar. experiencing mild almost symptoms. One friend first test positive group sick night, bad aches fever. essentially impossible completely, perfectly isolate vulnerable population virus running rampant general population.  Sweden proved that; we‘ve proven that.  takes tiny spark burn whole forest.  


It’s time stop acting like that’s possible start managing pandemic hundreds thousands lives depend it. know American situation, Canada tons blame go around. Poor cleaning standards health care, low wages, trying avoid paying benefits forcing workers get jobs multiple facilities accelerated spread.

It big wake call horribly seniors treated. (for already know) definitely think cause headaches sensitive them, straps put lot stress ears/face. 
But point headaches COVID haha Devastating. announced 2 weeks ago already briefings summer period happen Tuesdays Thursdays... “done everything right way” couple weeks mean anything virus. went crowd, stupid so, infected. 

Hope suffer serious effects recover, really hope somehow come smarter now. Florida taking upside V curve approach stopping virus see. fucking pencil. people seriously still understand fundamental concept wearing mask? doesn’t need “filter” anything prevent coughs droplets flying across room. workout mask would work perfect. makes certain NE struggling another outbreak? Sure, haven’t hit heard immunity, hard hit areas nearly 50-60% people antibodies. There’s quite literally many people left infect even large second wave. N95 mask protects wearer. Currently, I'm using A2B2E2K2P3 filter full face respirator (FM12) which, assure you, protects well N95. irrelevant people listening know important info anyway...

Its dumb dumbs need rectify Watching US politics tells sides think majority. know downplaying virus pissing supporters. gonna back fire him. Protesting deeply rooted societal inequities going beach bored vastly different things. rest world. post bullshit. problem guys miniscule fraction number infections do. risk much lower get-go. thing here, especially places infections continue climb, going still issue.  That’s true all. shed dead virus test positive.

The tests aren’t particularly accurate. him. Whistleblower basically said administrations initial plan address shortage preparation hoax flu probably tangent life terms overall stress management coping mechanisms. wish sub would actually provide usefull information. would numbers higher weather colder variables remained same? don’t think say sure, believe data points toward Coronaviruses thriving colder temperatures. we’re seeing rise cases doesn’t necessarily mean heat effect it. build lawsuit business metrics sell snake oil think NY's total sick population doubling weekly. think new cases doubling every days. Sure convenient day skip briefings... Honestly, hope catches recovers, suffers enough changes position masks. feel like justify morally, pain educational. agree that. crowds people air conditioned spaces breathing air, greater danger exposure.

All takes one infected person bar/restaurant/church etc God dammit dude. give us good news 😂 Thanks orange king denials, inaction, idiocy defeated covfefe virus! Indeed #ThouShaltNotCovidThyNeighborhood average, misleading talking group. people U.S. sense part group all? I'm amazed complete indifference keep encountering. California getting fucked SoCal. NorCal (Bay Area up) actually well entire world telling wear mask, yet insane reason y'all listen president gump band misfits saying work. 

Yet trust government, blindly follow them.

Couldn't confused right now. cares?0.o Please give ideas!!! last two decades, Jim’s fleecing gullible new wife Lori.

Meet new boss, old boss. ^(The Who) first wave Maine even weaker actual real waves get. Locked early opinion. second wave hits it'll much worse enough people allowed catch build immunity. anybody recently airport comment things like mask usage, hygiene policies, etc? Really, gyms shouldn’t open.

No probably go gym 72. Let people make choices. That's amazing!!! would fall pieces met Arnie. Florida, Texas, Georgia, Arizona’s governors along many residents showed disdain prevention methods suggested cdc paying price. DeSantis literally went national tv mocked predictions becoming true. surprised California wasn’t hit harder earlier. northeast struggling soon enough another outbreak. Yea, super careful health rest life. can’t even physically active, I’m still mostly bed rest weeks discharged hospital. protecting much flu season comes around. 

On pulse ox 90 new 100. charge him? enough. nearly 3 months this, going call is: TOTAL UTTER NONSENSE. cannot watch news programme anymore, given 24/7 monochromal pseudo-emotion ever see. 

There unholy axis blind incompetence dysfunctional governments, child-like called ‘expert scientists’, hysterical bedwetters still gall call news reporters. 

It’s like three-way intellectual masturbation contest arcane unintelligible concepts like R factor, nobody actually able point naked emperor say fucking obvious: *that lockdowns useless destroy countries.* 

We become hostages kind dystopian version Stockholm Syndrome, fucking ironic given Stockholm seems one places managed keep marbles.

We utterly terrified something utterly vanilla, least compared heart disease cancer. said: *this disease dangerous dangerous*. 

We cannot open schools panic stricken, yet two-hundred all-cause deaths primary school-aged children far year (UK), two died (or with) Covid-19. two! front page? 

Yes, kill elderly, let’s face – doesn’t? 180,000 people age 80 died year far, 27,000 unexceptional number (or with) Covid-19. almost (95%) serious health issues. 

For vast majority us, healthy middle age prime youth, chance dying tripping stairs. *This disease quite simply dangerous.*

And yet hear triple axis pontificating ‘must avoid catastrophic second wave’. total BS! hell worried second wave? Please. 

They haven’t even managed find one nitwit scientists roll expert ‘catastrophic second wave model’. anyone ever seen one? 

They telling us scared this, totally ignoring basic facts:

1. *We never even catastrophic first wave*. special hospitals unused NHS never reached critical care capacity.

2. 40,000 deaths still half estimates UK death toll 1968-69 Hong Kong flu epidemic, *which nobody even remembers*. far elderly people nowadays.

3. killed thousands people care homes murderous incompetence deliberately seeding Covid-19, maybe learn THAT.

4. behaving differently terms handwashing, social distancing social greetings. Good luck aspiring viruses. 

6. Children fall ill, unlikely spread it. ridiculous back school.

7. nowhere Europe shows infections continuing rise exponentially peaks April, even dense urban centres. fact, began steady decline since then. 

8. Sweden didn’t even lockdown, three-quarters per capita deaths strictest lockdowns. 

Why fuck everyone worried catastrophic second wave? total fantasy. chance seeing Second Coming. don’t need fucking ‘expert’ see total utter garbage. 

It bullshit. NY open since 5/15, it’s pretty low risk phase three started 6/12. NYC reopening, folks NY dining inside restaurants drinking bars again. I’ve noticed lot people stopped wearing masks, social distancing basically thing past. NY’s numbers pretty good, wonder end barrel pickles mid July. epidiomologist added middle. rest scientists different fields mentioned. cannot tackle complex problems single domain. need interdisciplinary approach. That's exactly what's lacking focus virologists epidemiologists (although disagree lockdown well linked). Here's another: worse half is, yeah Same. I'm Seminole first people good went weekend shopping/takeout pretty much ones wearing masks employees. Really sad, meanwhile Florida case numbers exploding. friend let know mom tested positive . 80s little contact people . getting ready move assisted care facility thus tested. Made realize virus everywhere. due protests. Plenty states protests yet seen bump cases. soon tell maybe, would Fl well. Best bet would nature, get away one Mother Earth atleast that’s I’m doing.
Same California. Although opened phase 3 believe, still see amount foot traffic saw early February, think people really afraid going back normal even masks social distancing. Costco work gone crazy busy 50-70 people warehouse time within week uprising cases. Nobody gives shit more, every man self! sub fear mongering again. solid evidence (though something take notice of) healthcare rest population vulnerable yours. I'm personal trainer/coach small fitness studio. going problematic sure, colleagues seemingly give fuck dramatically underestimate overall risk small enclosed space people huffing puffing right next other. would wear mask wouldnt expect clients restrictive. would rather train outdoors distance home via Zoom. Gyms inherently risky awhile great source virus transmission. dont expect clients anything feel safe comfortable, even affects bottom line. can’t move Canada. immigration laws. American, can’t even go seek asylum refugee Canada unless one family members Canadian citizen. enjoys social aspect going gym incorrectly thought everyone would wearing mask times okay amount risk. snot nosed kid won’t believe ask not? Cause wasn’t stupid stayed home! don’t need mask don’t go out.

You don’t beat virus staying inside. Exercise Vitamin good well fighting quarantine fatigue. don’t stupid. 2 hard fast rules look see increases happening: positive test % hospital utilization. PA well both. Like sweeping dirt rug. Everyone there. one point deal eventually. put worst gets. reality know worst get late. Americans yet figure humans spread virus. stick pot steam basket roiling boil. 10 minutes steam rattling lid. Okay thanks that's good know. asymptomatic people though? concern probably martial arts especially contact clinching. clue teacher enforce masks indoor training next week. effective treatment: feel like people lack imagination actually see person physically die order sink in. believing invisible deity planned everything? Piece cake. went back gym worked personal trainer didn’t wear mask? Wow. one people. lack unified national response people able travel freely states continue spread virus That's lifetime fitness does.

Granted, recommend getting quite Arnold (powerlifting steroids agree body days), statistically speaking hitting gym 2-4 times week 30-60 minutes usually add years life general quality life (I.E. seniors powerwalking 5 AM, shuffling walker dialysis). fuck ‘televangelists’ exist? everyone would get infected time number would much higher. 0.6% current rates everyone getting infected Seriously. come nobody ever talks millions people haven’t killed Trump’s incompetence? Well least fake cover numbers make leadership look better. Thanks Florida!

-Georgia Yeah, say easy, easier regular disposable N95 mask, since filter area bigger, two them. called whataboutism used deflect attention subject discussed.

It happens almost every thread puts PRC negative light. also leave mask hot car get similar effect heat works. Ah, anything find boring worth documenting. free everyone? Ah, mistake checking recollection thought heard referred 😂😂  downvoted? pure info. ideas many outbreaks slaughterhouses? Bad working conditions? refrigeration? (That would bad sign next winter...) one hated referred ""herd"" ever since started using phrase? still think you’re confused “flatten curve” actually means. Perhaps go research making look dense.

It better states “stay capacity hospitals”, understand graphs. can't achieve herd immunity without vaccine, question. Oh will. takes time. Westerners know East Asian people using umbrellas block sunlight There's way assume everything going world, chinese owned company would make sure product made country time dire need. 

So, claim US authorities, ones charge allowing opening said plants, could not, unlike you, see consequences could thus easily fooled? course world Covid free.

Not anyone measure intelligence actually cares that.

Covid simply threatening enough justify measures place far worse human life Covid potential be. Maybe getting shot choked death important haircut?

This might explain why, example, wife gets pissed spend $150 video games spend $150 groceries. Eek, market? end May, Ilana Freund landed deal apartment New York City attending graduate school. roommate signed lease two-bedroom apartment West Village $4,995 month. significant discount: Similar apartments building going around $5,300 pandemic took hold, according listing agent.

$60,000 year two-bedroom apartment., grad student. That's insane. flu kills majority within months fall winter. Mask wearing Dallas become frowned upon.

So true. jumped tiny elevator another lady got called ""fucking weirdo"". Doctor's office ""mandatory social distancing"" signs everywhere.  DFW area. correct. like studies say ""such such"" increases cancer risk 25%. give 25% chance getting cancer. means 1% chance getting before, 1.25% chance. 99% lol. want live reality. Stop spreading bullshit lies . Holy shit people mentally ill. Found another victim silenced man! 😂🤡 consumers need better job. hefty percentage customers would say store ""I want shop store feel safe everyone wearing mask"" would see policies change. Instead jerks want wear mask loudest. went grocery store last night. mostly old people cover noses.
I wanted ask mouth-breathers seems obvious are, metaphorically. China probably hoping one noticed, pandemic seen China crossing kinds boundaries. taking advantage world pandemonium. mean go back beginning country, exist due rebellion mindset never died haha. upsides, growth US country narrowly dodged defeat war 1812 country whose mere entry First World War less ensures victory allies fascinating short period time.

This rebellion gave us rock roll, hippie movement, civil rights movement, unique way life really one else shares.

On bad side, also gave us confederacy continuing racial oppression every time Us government told people knock guy statistician, epidemiologist. People get virus don’t develop antibodies contributing herd immunity aren’t immune (and yes, I’m aware cross reactive cells- help clear virus faster probably sufficient keep getting spreading first place). Where’s source? NPR yesterday:

“Florida testing 200,000 people week, double number tested weekly article points positive testing rate also going up, unlike numbers CNN using, clear indication cases rising. Kudos NPR. think there's good amount truth that. We'll know 2nd half July. Georgia's fine? maybe i’m thick,


but,


what’s “policy”? Hurry die, peons! making determination one way other. AFAIK countries technically allowed _refuse_ entry citizens international law, albeit anything quarantine travelers. trouble reopening anything less-than-essential people want go places disproportionately deniers, government made rules, really come plausible-sounding plan enforce them. at-risk group? Congrats PA! Keep up, need you. mutating[It mutating. lucky pandemic timing guy? Barely coverage normally would’ve crazy scandal. Tex-ass! I'll tell ya much. line explains everything. all-cause death rate Jan May line previous years.

Perhaps ... freak out? article says ""clear present symptoms"" February diagnosed COVID-19, mention actually testing positive, says tested positive antibodies later. think probably right likely scenario symptoms + antibody test (of false negative rate tremendously high early virus widespread), may well never first time around. Worth noting there's also mention traveling China Europe prior ""first round,"" seems highly unlikely woman Dallas would symptomatic infection two weeks first known case there. Deaths always lag behind new cases. please keep trying shift goalposts. make $3,360 month, hell make $4,420 *two* months. know I'm flat broke moments like really drive home. There's brigade downvotes anything reflects poorly Sweden. Virginia. general looks like Mid Atlantic huge success story *so far:* dense region fairly close NYC, yet virus never got solid footing here, many people thought risk becoming next global hot spot. curve going fast region, even either stage 1 2 reopening. Mask usage is, anecdotal experience, high. hear much us anymore though. It’s disgrace. going call Australians organize international committee investigate Duh. Let em ""perish"" Silver lining, neither vast majority supporters, shall see many trumplings become sick next couple months. that's stretch

But, maybe Good.
Hoping closings. two reasons problem pointed (and shitty).

Media coverage events based shocking are. generally means things rare get covered heavily things common barely get covered (this might related ""death one tragedy, death millions statistic"" phenomenon).

The end result public ends thinking rare things common common things rare. coverage shootings prime example this. Everyone's terrified kids getting killed big school shootings events get massive coverage. kids get shot streets Chicago average week get shot suburban schools year. Needless say, shootings streets Chicago get much coverage: stuff seen ""news"".

Secondly, humans need feel they're control take positive action bad things happening. coronavirus fucked everyone up, there's virtually *positive* action average person take stop (""stay fuck home"" satisfy feeling). Millions people psychologically transferring fears virus onto cops brutalising people.

It's co-incidence things Floyd said video, one thing everyone latched onto ""I can't breathe"". huge extent, people angry virus, even know it. Smart man. bottom line here: around strangers, wear masks. Full stop there. Bakker sued state Arkansas days ago asking financial records. Release MCO Airport linked below, providing clarification #s.  

Bottom line, looks like DeSantis misspoke. 


(1) 500 cases conducted 3 day period last week, resulted 2 positive results.   


(2) 260 number, meanwhile, number positive cases traced airport mid-March today.

Could explain wearing one? number daily deaths Florida still quite low. Let's panic age, it’s smart bench. risks far outweigh benefits.

You’d think so, classmate told me, younger people, especially age bracket (20s), Covid less deadly us even flu. isn’t sense danger self preservation kicked in.

I discussing roommate pointed something. generation people don’t live fear. roommate put “if choose go bar, get sick, get sick, made decision, fine consequences”.

Also, disrespectful wear masks previous flu season? Ask people really get point. all. saying wearing masks prevent spread CoVid somehow disrespecting millions died smoking secondhand smoke?

Somebody needs John McEnroe thing would interesting COVID somehow led scientists researching better steroids less long term side effects eventually create self-regenerating elixir extends life like crazy shit like that. level don’t conceptualize new cases somewhat differently trailing deaths consistently falling rolling basis two months? 

I’m worried new cases anyone else here, I’m looking new daily cases 8-4 weeks ago numbers new daily cases higher current daily new cases (thus, one would think should’ve seen deaths rise least plateau). death trend isn’t reversing course (and fingers crossed that’ll continue true). point is?

Is good news even get chances death bit lower?

Why needlessly pessimistic? School usually opens beginning August (and lets May) else Ontarians supposed look guidance? Premier thing (minus provincial borders, free movement that's meaningless)? Run along lazy cunt 60-70% right now... Memberships Annual Passes.

People need talking more. Every business Membership Annual Pass system exists majority folks sign use Pass/Membership infrequently therefore company makes ton money.

With Covid, companies would issue refunds every single pass/membership holder cancel future payments. companies already spent money already planned yearly financials monthly subscribers mind.

This America hardcore reopening. Spineless governors getting necks breathed every single membership/pass company cannot afford issue every member refund due breach contract facilities available.

By Reopening, companies say they're still providing service cannot sued breach contract obligation issue refunds. Bullshit. Sure, can't enforce everyone wearing mask, I'll damned can't make examples egregious offenders use law impart seriousness mask wearing. feel zero percent sorry slow rolling ass.

Took away substantive tools local leaders compel things like business closures (touchy, know) mandatory mask ordinances (the single best tool avoid lockdown/deaths). live east coast. Alaska here.

Sounds like cousin cousin law social people lol think people hear number like 116,854 abstract, without knowing means scale country. Like feel someone tells many people die car accidents year, something.

Comparing pandemic likely going help, pandemics also pretty abstract average person U.S. March. Wars, however, carry ton weight national consciousness. Sadly that's works, way growing reports sequelae, likely want catch even once: even asymptomatics report organ damages happen catch second time immunity fades, still sure much lasts, chances death permanent damages increase lot. lol agree There's evidence virus follows seasonal trends yet. average nursing home stay 14-17 months.

I understand disagreeing even hating Trump, however, pulling quotes context like doesn’t anything sway opposition view. increases tribalism current economic system. Potentially, based know SARS Dr. Fauci others said, immunity likely couple months.

I wonder issue isn’t short immunity, antibody tests totally inadequate figure cases.

It’s thing see US, areas got slammed March new cases, areas didn’t getting hit hard, even little difference reopening policies behavior people. one finds laughable people still need told wear masks shit?

them's fightin' words Ah, saying Trump magpie disguise. could explain things. countries locked much effectively longer periods time, think less something like human nature messaging feeling consensus things safer, even aren't. Honestly, thought it’d cure disease I’d heartbeat. happening USA right science disbelief acceptable ignorance disgrace American people whole. one side lying, denying, death it’s hard compromise. Recent comments even redditors: ""if doom sayers want live fear, go ahead. rest us going enjoy ourselves.""

There's real cure stupid, ultimately. every one though. lot people don’t access enough masks. wearing one sure, telling people doesn’t anything dangerous stupid Apple/Google Exposure Notification API wasn’t Singapore codebase (and descendants thereof) didn’t exist Singapore App built. see one wearing masks city 700k ive thought buying bunch masks handing out. way without spending lot money? would include little scare packet mask, detailing outcomes young, healthy people. like dialysis losing leg. worry took hydroxychloroquine.

Wait minute! would first time, seen anyway, coronavirus spread via food, specifically possibly salmon case. would kinda change things overnight verified countries.

Personally, believe imported food test positive. even going go “what if” scenarios besides becoming vegetarian sound appealing. number rising stupid gov. they’re wearing mask they’re safe either understand point. Let guess, ""I wish able hug father one last time"" Keep mind deaths typically lag positive tests many weeks. Many people end dying due virus spend weeks sick ventilator first Superfly Jimmy Snuka! night got better.

It’s shit virus. think comparison really old war makes little sense. Big deal. data provided Monday state's Public Health Department shows quarter state's confirmed cases come last two weeks, according Associated Press.

The protests began 3 weeks ago sent message mass gatherings okay.

Blacks make 26% Alabama's population, account 41% cases 46% Obviously one going drop dead moment leave house people like took seriously months ago still conversation thousands people dead. Countries like New Zealand announcing zero new cases US still rise. I'm sick are. Spoke *at* Trump accurate. guess must depend town. live Mexican side border Texas, restaurants take only, masks social distancing almost everywhere.  doesn’t need expert know that, people think pandemic fashion recovering routine nothing happening now, people... USA, expect never ending quarantine. read article. saw headline decided good news. technically paradox prematurely reopening economy results buyer's remorse?  Since it’s first wave guess fukwad correct. feel too. I’ll suck wear mask. It’s whatever. I’m sick people calling people “selfish” voluntarily hermit months end. Humans social creatures. don’t like locked down. Lots places proactively testing. ANYONE goes hospital reason gets tested area. friend works therapist travels different locations. gets tested every two weeks job. lots companies require testing work. Australia apparently forked Singapore codebase. Willful ignorance Hell drug. 4k remember exact figure. saying ""it's competition"" speaking state high daily number 1k week, possible do. say correct? relevant? That's right. since can't teach empathy there's really getting them. Trump gone full Gish Gallop point. Non medical n95 like would buy auto paint etc work good medical nit better. virus droplets (aerosol still tiny droplets) filtered mask. filtration material med non med approved n95 masks.

How get trouble improper wear. nose strip needs clamp properly need keep facial hair away seal rim. people mess up. Murder Wrote They've got right take business elsewhere. Sounds fair me. know goal antibody tests per day, shall ignore flair, even though article linked mostly said antibody tests? 

On quick look, see source comment linked, always makes slightly sceptical. Still, true, one wonders change focus mostly capital, country wide. Since number cases (confirmed unconfirmed) decline, could see logic switching test focus, though without details can't say agree disagree move. Natural selection phenomenon population, even small groups. evolutionary advantages covid-19 die, evolutionary disadvantages covid-19 live can't claim particular instance someone dying example selection, rather talk ""selection pressure"" applies population causes population change. Also, people tend conflate value judgments natural selection. makes sense. AZ fridge trucks keep overflow morgues. 

AZ big trouble. yeah metric fuckton healthcare workers getting sick dying statistics amount comments daily discussion would interesting see social media network's attention virus waxed waned. like everyone ignores science. leaving comment check back later see removed per rule 4 Saw headline week ago. possible? Math doesn’t add up.  good grasp contact tracers state doing. 50% population contained pretty easily 500 positives day. knowledge Oklahoma contact tracers effective, even any. you?

The problem number positive tests. problem might contact tracing all.

I get covid-is-serious brigade work combat covid-is-a-hoax brigade, mean us shooting breeze reddit can't make arguments substance without called knowing they're talking about. tell absolute certainty number daily positive tests still possible borderline easy contain from. worry, be, Oklahoma trying.  likely combination measures, one factor.

Really dude, nobody bottom thread. watching Survivor Series ‘96 FS1. Saw Rocky Mavia’s debut. Stone Cold got beat man man Bret Hitman Heart.

What else got going on. Really. bored. chit chat. Deep fried stick Wonder hell say hit 10k per day? I’m sure honest. I’ve customers saying it’s illegal making big fuss it. Also management hasn’t said refuse them. disadvantage. imagine much would help did, terms normalizing it. think would make big difference Around ME, think overall probably ok, every single day see cases folks wearing masks indoors like stores.

 Saw one young girl wearing one checking Home Depot checkout guy probably 65 wearing 'I'm veteran' button (and yes, mask). Post office clerk today pulled around neck (I felt ask put approached); guy front line wearing one. Frustrating. It’s gonna keep climbing reaches ghoulish untolerable level admit mounting fatalities need addressed

Fuck that's dark quote definitely wouldn’t go right now, *but* roller coaster *phenomenal*. give cite, please? 

Because judging downvotes, nobody believes you. give cite, maybe conversation begin. turns people don’t like quarantined locked down. woulda thought? said trade magazine pharma.  meant pharmaceutical manufacturers.  idea pharmacist use.

What saying.. seat belts / bike helmets ....


.... people stupid. Today end shift actually got touching sincere thank gentleman customer :) people almost make awful ones. Almost. Thank you, I’ll look this! I’ve trying get retail office finish degree competition fierce. convoluted r/beetlejuicing wife quit job healthcare last month. I’m going risk family Americans want idiots. find someone else take care selfish asses. States prioritized according election polling numbers. I’m sure perpetuated everywhere. know that’s us healthcare workers use protect ourselves? So’s UK Masks better job protecting us cops. go. pretty clearly track protests. starters, cities biggest longest running protests aren’t seeing increases. Second, increases clearly began protests. gym repurposed outdoor parking lot. Hospitalization rates climb people getting tested sooner infection know treat it. 

This isn’t February sending folks home hang It’s amazing many people don’t know this. Doctors don’t wear masks delivering baby baby can’t make sick. protect baby. Whats appropriate level panic second wave? People contradictory. 
Plus think people don’t believe (lack of) science homemade masks, particularly outdoor. Yeah went revenue office renew license (because can't online reason), one wearing masks. Like guys.... like this?! Everything become political issue. that’s big part problem. Divide created need unity. think could drop words ""in China"" locks pandemic, yknow, said that, poof, would disappear. fast came here. know things, best people, good American people, giving numbers, really beautiful numbers. disappear. We've best reaction it. there's great vaccine small, mean tiny, amounts corona still there. hospitals empty! healthcare system--the best healthcare, know, best healthcare country. Certain presidents tried take away us, brought back. amazing, helping African Americans... much president, even honest Abe! even honest, eh, well, say things, things make me, frank, sure honesty. But, vaccine--which think anyone even needs, a, shall say, precaution, well, numbers--the cases--are low, we're working governor Florida, Texas, Ohio get vaccines there. Help good American people--a tiny, tiny, number people--I'm sure vote aid, stimulus, brought economy back states too. brought back. said flu, China flu, would gone QUICK. gone. Poof! Like magic. Disappeared. administration things administrations wouldnt do, unthinkable things, beautiful things. Make America great thank much taking questions time. Every single disaster movie called it.

Except Contagion, ironically. got science right overestimated world’s leaders Stay safe. Well, thank that. 

There probably people appreciate it, never say anything.  battle ... it’s gaslighting trump &amp; co. Sounds like wanna violate right refuse service people post attempt undermine communicability BSL-3 pathogen? matter 1-100 people get infected protesting. still high risk behavior places individuals participating risk millions nonpartcipants risk well. pretending contagious all?  Maybe won’t die, wouldn’t wish dialysis anyone. Yup.. relaxing social distancing. maintain social distancing stabbing someone? 8 weekend. EVERYTHING FI🔥E Covid19 also kills cubicle, would silver lining. meditating keep peace mind. decided done guy killed racist cop saids 110 tested positive 110 worked there. I'm pretty sure scene Ice Cube - Whatever could wrong.

EDIT: wrong. Printer scene Geto Boys - Still. Great soundtrack. Yeah would think wouldnt you. I'm STEM too. get actual high paying job regular old bachelors doesnt cut field dont time money go back more. make well minimum feel like difference pay enough cover loans better quality life. basically put ton work break even financially. mortgage I'm months away owning car though better could be. who's say would even landed job without degree, guess makes little harder value. Alright instead focusing future forecasts, don’t stop shit address issue now? I’m cautious/be smart crowd future projections fear mongering bullshit.

Who cares could months road? don’t anyone good they’re always proven wrong human intervention anyway, much ask instead focus fix problem hand opposed laying projections like this? look Arizona future. we’re staying inside, one’s wearing masks. Sigh. China owns company.. B12 diet related often* b12 issues vegan, misspoke vitamin What?

Edit: read previous statement wrong. bad. wonder kinda treatment would got back home... politician died virus yet, especially none wearing masks? Right! Somebody watched contagion recently. Relax. elaborate ground glass opacities are? Canadian citizen living US lost job move back, quarantined 14 days, free. 60-90 days register car Canada. Probably longer since cross US didn’t departed US. 

A Canadian citizen living US working home Canada pandemic quarantining. 

A Canadian citizen living US recently came back Canada let family member borrow car quarantine. Basketball play enclosed bubble. Baseball still involve travel different locations  masks kep along?

Wonder Fauci, Surgeon General, CDC, specifically told us effective wear them. Well I'm wrestler can't say sure seems like aside makeup artists able stay reasonably far away others mentioned. problem though family gets another statistic. Nobody heeds families warning, told government got irresponsible. doesnt matter much family regrets said past believe happen family. I'm really fascinated this. plausible tied human nature way. certain point people start let biological impulse take better judgment? first tribal offense, ignorant people, acting carelessly, I'm seeing smart, responsible individuals hard quarantiners weeks ago, throwing care window, like said, based nothing.  Oh boy comes smh cited decline daily virus deaths leveling-off daily new infections 20,000 positive signs U.S. making progress virus, arguing majority states seen cases decline remain stable

this terrible logic. numbers even CDC Director Tom Frieden, served Obama administration, said blog post Tuesday percentage tests coming back positive increasing U.S., indicating spread COVID-19 increasing least week. mask butthole? That's pretty optimistic.

There second wave America first wave go down. Including Americans Well LIED us masks wanted decide lives dies. F scumbag. Let us iiiiiin! supposed go covid turns country zombies Trump gets reelected? There's reason toilets lid thing put down. 

That's entire purpose it. Yes unfortunately tests healthcare medicine one thing can't/shouldn't rushed. test something 10 months know there's long term side effect typically develops year. voters care. They'll get away likely. guess history books Spanish flu making second wave well. know anything pandemics work? almost always second wave history shown us true think clinical trial new steroid called vamorolone supposed conclude May 2020. hoped would offer benefits without near side effect load. know released results yet (no time search much right now). find original article saw 2018 find info searching vamorolone. It’s weird. went office today, haven’t 8 weeks. 35 people throughout office, one wearing mask. openly ridiculed numerous people ridiculous already. don’t get people. Exactly family doing. Slowly stockpiling supplies ran low started. going caught guard fall/winter. Trump listening Fauci, taking Fauci's advice, allowing Fauci speak, Fauci basically sidelined.  first-string quarterback sitting bench team losing game 60 0, half time. 

I suspect Fauci could make much effective contribution resigning government job.  (I sure could full tenure professorship, choice university, wants.)  could appear guest every major news network, frequently, next several months. 

We need tell Americans wear masks. message needs come someone people respect listen to. needs repeated, dozens hundreds times, everyone gets it.  

Fauci could make enormous contribution -- could convince whole country start wearing face masks.  That, itself, could easily save million lives. swear gets worse day. Like mobile games, American politics pay win. Bruh! Still 1st wave. presuming I’m infected zero evidence support belief different assuming I’m guilty evidence. country you’re innocent proven guilty.

So I’ll walk around freely enjoying freedom. fLu Happy see neighbors ignorant inconsiderate. find sickening. hostility toward concept society solidarity human beings. deserve butthole spiders penis bees. name stimulating local economy, shut place “deep cleaning” spread family friends turn spread family friends. expectations Florida low, holy fuck. need move away again. Ah yes right ... I'm sure experience contact tracer good grasp accurate ""we keep up"" numbers COVID: ""I wanna thank state Florida electing DeSantis. guys make job easy."" 2nd wave? still 1st wave Ga. never get second wave keep peaking. Amen America want open everything everyone needs wear masks. don’t want wear masks well going increase spread prolong problem. people dedicated life helping people. life threatened people trying help. 

I'm reminded dad always told growing up, ""The world's fair"". know. thrives spewing much BS it’s almost impossible give idiotic statement full ridicule. battling articles like watching tennis match. Back forth constantly. ""Smithfield Foods, Inc., pork producer food processing company based Smithfield, Virginia, United States, wholly owned subsidiary WH Group China...."" 

I doubt thanks sacrifice. lie detector test determined, telling TRUTH! *LIVE AUDIENCE ERUPTS CHEERS* Chaos Theory. Well Wisconsin. Corona loves it! people crammed nearly shoulder shoulder gambling huge HIVAC blowing coronavirus crowds...hell inviting lungs ffs! *knows small area compared China

Load BS. Total area Population density great way lie using statistics. Vast swathes China inhabitable deserted. entire population country packed arable areas. India atleast 10+ million hectares arable land compared China. Brazil basically going show us bad virus really is, right? American football like religion places. empire. Nba also creating bubble players live travel interacting outside world (at least players). heard mlb title article clearly states 104 million people *at risk* severe covid infection. That's true statement. headline claiming ""About 34 American million smokers risk lung cancer,"" true even though vast majority get it. costs 20 million deemed essential Trump ignorant toddlers. Ive said multiple times ALWAYS get told im asshole might small group people take seriously. totally agree Texas doesnt fucking care governor mayors made point make look reason numbers going fault. state could closed schools earlier, held graduation ceremonies high school stadiums, city funded, state funded gatherings, enforced people wear mask public, let local jursidictions manage covid response, many things help curb spread disease, none things. said, ""YOU GET IT, FUCKING FAULT"" 

It's pure fucking negligence State, pushed corporate america trying keep economy open money politicians pockets. fact cheap well hugely benefits poorer countries able afford it.

Just don’t let American government get greedy grubby hands it, know it’ll cranked price almost immediately. Dallas literally ever bar packed, friends popping bottles bottle service spin studios opening like back good ole times. 

You see masks usage decreased drastically across board since start June. 

Left city last weekend go hiking state park stopped gas like normal day would say 95% masks even employees wearing masks. valid reasons? Lol disagree there. economy nowhere go considering unprecedented shutdown. However, seems misguided expectations quickly economy running pre-cv levels. Travel/hospitality could take several years. going long process even though many think snap back blink. 

I love cruises man... thought spending week two perfect outbreak machine nightmares made of. Lol ""Smithfield Foods, Inc., pork producer food processing company based Smithfield, Virginia, United States, wholly owned subsidiary WH Group China. Founded 1936 Smithfield Packing Company Joseph W. Luter son, company largest pig pork producer world.""

Researched it. face may look american boss isnt he'd hurry finish writing we'd see interpretation 2021. I’m Jewish, cleanliness checks balances food chain extremely important us. rich can’t wait get money going backs us

It's geo-political. China trying assert dominance, cannot militarily... yet. need build economy militarily overtake U.S. US needs strong economy ensure dominance.

If way reach Chinese population convince they're used, perhaps could decrease production without China making world even worse. Empathy complicated animal brain. :( tiny portion people murder steal, talking about? people follow rules.

If tiny portion people follow social distancing guidelines, we'd great shape. sometimes sadly imagine would've happen embraced masks outset. many people would happily wear them. Fewer deaths. We'd able reopen get back lives faster, masks on. But, alas! Yikes. Gilbert resident here. frequent stores too. woke today scratchy throat, headache, sinus pain. fever loss smell though (at least yet).

Two questions you: 1)when lose sense smell? 2) get tested? Fauci spoke ""at"" fuckwad there. can't talk ""to"" someone blockheaded imbicile. better chance candybar comprehension situation bloated orange museum treachery. Whoosh I'm thankful someone mention air instead this, half US would hold breath spite. Yup, I’m moving put thermostat 72 otherwise start sweating get uncomfortable. usually 65. Whenever stay parents feel like going burn alive. keep 80!😳

I could never live warm state, I’d stay inside time.  really don’t, it’s half hearted caring awesome, whole family (I live SE Michigan) worried guys far population centers wouldn’t following rules

But proved wrong, awesome job world thinks this. need hand lifting enormous ego? I'm going wait Huawei version   treating systemic issues personal responsibility. valid true, valid say research means nothing change anything.

Having actual evidence back assertion drug might help significant larger uptake globally save significant number lives. mean dumb fucks expect? Could bias there. Like people don’t think it’s big deal don’t wear masks ones likely going public. Therefore, looks like people don’t want wear masks it’s really people willing time. Use decrease public awareness stock supplies coming tidal wave sickness disruption. Buy everything need another lockdown people ""tired COVID"" realize need supplies too. LOL, “second wave”... I've taken constitutional law class, understanding first amendment means government restrictions must neutral regards content communication, method communication may regulated (e.g. giant billboards near residential road), long they're de facto harming certain messages. *“These people, people efficient, professional, compulsive consumers. It’s civic duty. Consumption. It’s new national pastime. Fuck baseball. It’s consumption. true lasting American value that’s left. Buying things. Buying things. People spending money don’t things don’t need. MONEY DON’T THINGS DON’T NEED. max credit cards spend rest lives paying 18 percent interest something cost 12.50. didn’t like got home anyway! bright, folks. fucking bright.”* - George Carlin read urns?! /s testing, look testing. testing quite, quite magnificent. best testing, quite frankly. But, test less, see numbers actually begin to, decline. We're looking it. smart people looking this. Random anecdote!

Decades ago (literally) college, four us living townhouse. two neat people two messy slobs. Eventually two neat people got tired cleaning messy slobs went strike.

If leave glass little bit milk kitchen weeks, kinda fascinating. grow spores grow upward, collapses weight. That, er, probably healthiest us, sick cleaning shit.

Eventually one threw glass trash. America you. Average social security check 1503 dollars.

Try living LOL can’t believe Beijing worrying 31 new cases. got thousands opening up. wimps. sarcasm . #Bible belt gonna Bible belt love riding train. wish them. Sad. actual reason can’t tell /s tag left apartment 3 months. can't done virus Weak puny humans

I've worn p100 masks

Since January bro ain't even leaving house masked 100%. I'm saying unfortunately assholes mostly harm others, Italian living USA AZ looks Lombardiesque shit hit fan.
Exponential growth, hospitals surge capacity. one really thinks virus real. month vast majority people don’t care all. 

And seriously hoping I’m wrong. know many people care there.  Fuck second wave shit. Brazil 🇧🇷 gone getting deadlier second wave hotspot. nEeD HaiRCuT

/s went service store company want mention. getting paid it.
Long story short ,the person assisting told superior close counter take two steps back. Fine big deal, rules place reason. said ""sometimes forget rules"". person replied saying ""i know I'm tire this, hate wearing mask. want stop using it(not complete exact words best ability remember it).""
I said"" well,we are. feels good get home safe, wake next day"". confused. took seconds process it. said yeah.sign. right. 

I hate staying home, could go outside hang bar co workers work. Get drunk, see weird shit train way work also back home. family get together. even go work school. 

But family well understand, restricting selves order keep living. take it. “In cases, 80% people don’t severe disease, **so people going recover fully**,” says Carlos del Rio, MD, infectious disease specialist professor epidemiology Emory University.

Is responsible statement make? feel enough data back says.

Edit: Bolded actual statement talking about. hell bold!?  Can't be. Magpies mate life. Exactly! arguing guy day. saying offensive lineman nfl morbidly obese average BMI close 40.. guys huge amounts muscle. There’s way obese people could play professional football. always cold going around Virus dirt Governor Looks like Alabama little 700, Texas around 2,300. raw numbers horrific hopefully curb it. Considering NJ still around 1,300 trending weeks weeks weeks, control yet hopefully ""sets record hospitalizations"" wakes everyone gets slowed quicker. lag reporting day. 40,000 tests ended one day reason 4,000 cases one time think wearing anything better nothing encouragement wear mask dangerous everyone involved! yeah true. really care much they're up, real data much capacity they? comment definitely say otherwise haha 200IQ Let’s reopen, complain wearing masks, stand next people, pretend nothing wrong. What’s worst happen? /s Population state 5.15 million people. Hopefully state going flatten curve. get talking ""second wave"" either, reason. moment steps outta white house NY state arrest him. Quote Trump: ""If stop testing right now, we’d cases, any” 

following President's orders Gov. Indiana: Lets test 80 we'll fewer cases less die. /s “In cases, 80% people don’t severe disease, people going recover fully,” says Carlos del Rio, MD, infectious disease specialist professor epidemiology Emory University. 

Where get numbers make statement? stop agree allot saying here, problem masks turned political stance elected officials top bottom pretending Rona bill wanna pay.. exactly fix situation now? 

Refusing close things again
Refusing wear masks.
Refusing contact tracing. 

Sorry people stepping bodies see gets better, unless ofcourse indeed magically disappear. I’m sure see why.... mean, yes, could say previous case infectious/deadly based population, loss life quantifiable. 116,000 dead 116,000 dead, 111 million Americans 370 million must work nursing home. virus mutates become contagious, becomes less dangerous.

An outbreak cases doesn’t mean people dying openly boasted people live household dinner? locations posted, obvious pointed - refers public restrooms.

Well, surprise, public restrooms seat covers. they, like likely bad shape. 

So, really important, automate public toilet seat covers U.S. 

But first - double blinded placebo trial see really case. thought we're pointing random people crowded spaces without masks. Oy! lot start quoting MP Fox news think real!  I've Graves 5 years. carbimazole got traded propycyril suffered weird reaction early doors. Levels generally over, distant past long margin. dropped approximately 2 years ago, put thyroxine point stop block - thyroxine propycyril. work early levels stabalised binned thyroxine went 30s.Only last 9 months that's come acceptable level. I'm endocrinologist who's pretty clued up. 

Same guy using case study what's happening now. Unfortunately I've spoken phone due coronavirus. GP catalyst funnily enough - graves bloods done hospital rather GPs due local politics, phoned GP asking bloods forgot done (it fine bloods taken GP anything recently). decided anyway bending rules check OK. B12 levels things done well appointment. It’s like trying gauge behavior bull shark tiger shark. behave slightly different, sharks end day eat smell blood go water. 
Seeing saw bad spikes colder areas colder months, I’d say it’s safe bet say well bigger spike fall. piss poor handling issue. Americans selfish, greedy stubborn beat this, corona win end we’ll infected someone decided politicize this.  That’s really disheartening hear. store doesn’t fuck that, I’m REALLY happy about. also security dude front enforces rule.  God said, ""Cometh thy holy house get rona."" came, love like plague. Even travellers to/from Beijing suspended due outbreak. doomsayers manipulate figures suits stay home agenda Offices retrofit ventilation systems. people working that. It’s challenge scale almost impossible imagine. Office property developers managers must going hell right now. 

I live Seattle construction going nuts since 2013-14. sparkly new buildings mostly empty, probably stay way next year earliest. learned I’ll working home least January 2021. like it, there’s entire economy built around expectation buildings occupied. that’s going happen building assure tenants safe. 

And people keep dismissing playing virus blind fact prolonging economic impact. office building manager, would furious every time read story like this. think it’s mostly average people don’t wear correctly. Healthcare workers get PPE training - average people put whatever without checking proper fit take without realizing there’s specific way remove it. Well, guess Charlize Theron's reddit account. 20 nat 1s Can't count covid deaths bc Florida basket case people want read dramatic events.

who want's constantly read eg Balkan states nearly eliminating problem .. boring news.

and besides, Reddit frequented white, 20-40yo male, middle-class americans know countries exist, let alone states state union /s Heh, looked post history, cause curious. spam stuff wild seeming, said, like subreddit created and/or moderator on. don’t moderate anything don’t really know goes, two actual lip syncing videos Trump stuff funny.

Seriously cheers. can't make sure actually going Alaska? go USA ask staying, ask addresses, etc . Seems like loophole could addressed future. People see wearing mask likely also wear mask, decent job protecting them. weird NJ, pumped see 500 cases, part surge states. Hopefully get here. testing available vs March/April us, hopefully stop outbreaks first wave gets handled better. makes complete sense it’s good thing milder cases identified/caught now, seems like there’s daily onslaught media panic camped “things getting worse, rising cases here, deaths coming.” yes, generally lag, there’s little national focus reality deaths keep falling (which welcome sign). seems like vast majority reporting focuses cases alone. Scare packet?

So basically want highlight extreme anomalies portray certain way? F outa here. Maybe food inspection check. WORK Important point well vote largely fell along racial lines. 

3/3 black council members voted favor mask ordinance, joined 1/5 white council members. huffingtonpost.ca may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

For lady, I'm entirely convinced PCR swab first presentation. 
Back February, disease taken seriously many parts USA tests would hard come by. journalist seems skim detail actual ""test"" appears fought home. Maybe ""test"" retrospective clinical (she later positive Abs), enough journalist tick ""test"" (they this...). Maybe flu &amp; bronchitis first presentation false positive serology prior donating plasma.
I provided details chain comments. Thank God! American cousin planning visiting us respecting 14 day mandatory quarantine expecting visit us home. I've already decided coming inside home. person grandparents groceries shopping. way would risk cousin over. third populous US state flattening curve. understand government's response. watching makeshift measures health care workers took trying keep safe lack national response federal government...the lie hail Mary.  months ago, don’t forget someone White House said number decrease summer comes.

""Big pharma release drug called 'covidroid' fight covid19, miracle drug like steroid, covid19 ! selling cheap price $999.99""  restrictions begun. Dimming gaslight Yep. happens society citizens called consumers raised like veal. still colds going around, respiratory symptoms probably Coronavirus? selfish! media government really focused wearing masks save people think would helped some. really stressed lockdown careful wearing masks would end causing cases later on, another lockdown economy even worse. protests? Unironically, key question government faces. many potential deaths justifies nuking constituents economy millions livelihoods? can’t everyone losing minds masks realize this, then? N95 masks stop 95% particles 300nm larger. Cov2 80nm. flying hell anyone pushing porous cotton fabric masks respiratory virus small? Nah people yo busy protesting. isn’t point talking wont second wave, first one never ended thing happens me. run office every week 2 every time get BS comments ""still"" wearing mask. assistant even work directly (err, indirectly now... upload raw video files drop memory cards footage edit) CF can't help think want ever somehow responsible way anyone get sick die.

I’m vexed inaction congress cushion economic impact immediate lockdown caused, inaction facilitating longer term economic stability individuals ready re-enter workforce health concern struggling re-enter workforce.

More anything else, political sphere’s response crisis absolute disaster continues so. local Menards, 2 family members work, requires employees wear masks. kind upsetting went small party store near home grab milk. wore mask. walked in..no masks staff customers. walked patron...he let big, wet cough.  muttered self “seriously?” approached checkout clerk said too? said what? said don’t like way people drive...that talking bad drivers said thought agreeing conversation. said no..that guy isn’t wearing mask coughed. got mad, asking thought cough..I ignored him, paid walked door turned coughed me. I’m fearful clerk gave debit card receipt name he’ll come trash house. Fools abound... world going gym right now? think bunch already. gonna tell infected people white house Trump's resort wearing masks contact them. respiratory disease... mask help either way. Thanks. Considering whether job even worth anymore point. Wouldn’t worst thing got fired ripping one people. Literally — people keep saying there’s gun’a second wave I’m like .. 

*but haven’t even stopped first?* Ah, remember years ago Australia burning ground Amazon people like “Nah, global warming hoax!” Oh wait, earlier year. Also, know took mega seriously months ago. media hyped die. family didn’t leave house good two months. part 100%. learned came realize thing completely overblown lockdown causing damage virus. 

Stop assuming things. This. another perspective actually act reinstate confidence consumers, people stop buying salmon fear. Considering treatments Spanish Flu like one step burning witches stake, likely we're better people get coronavirus, save lot people used able flu. doubt way people travel much faster we're much actually stop spread COVID-19 country. However......you *ARE* father!!!!! Funny say that. live Jax lot places beach subsequently “closed cleaning” group places. Except every interior air conditioned space, seem kept extra cold compensate heat outside.

I wonder people driven extra cold air conditioned spaces Florida, Texas, Arizona contributing rise cases states. That’s thing hospitalizations...it’s great people go get better. best hospitals ever, it’s double edged sword. people would stop going hospital we’d less cases hospital...so kind works too. Well funded targeted campaigns wearing could've created enough social pressure wouldve helped sane population keep foothold. Instead are. plan. watch this. Even wearing glasses protect tad bit. *Yellowstone super volcano joined chat* - think politics pushed Newsom re-open everything quickly. dont test, wont rise all.

*taps forehead, gets infected* 13,416 hospital beds Arizona, 1,506 COVID19 patients right according worldometer 2% need ICU. average ICU usually 68% capacity. think everyone thinks capacity coronavirus patients lol. 12% average ICU. get cases that's testing. idiots

More like 50-60%. shit troll lmao. sarcastic said irrelevant shit, done talking San Francisco huge anti-mask movement 1919 eventually city dropped mask requirement. always dumbasses America, people still stuck 1919. it’s also true deaths continue decrease. Shouldn’t they, least, staying level given number cases roughly entire time? good news real question purpose poll serve? Americans ding dongs, fewer 40% population holds higher education degree, everyone stubborn. 

I trust opinion Americans. I'm smarter them, even acknowledge cognitive bias subject matter. Statistics lie. Statistics opinions insignificant. Perhaps poll scientists researching virus since discovery would hold weight, something tells would results would desirable subreddit. personally listen Trump exact opposite.  There’s cases linked protests significant outbreaks. Despite large groups protests transmission rate outside majority protesters wearing masks probably fraction transmission rate indoor church service nobody wearing masks. Well, 9th circuit, busy court , due hear appeal. lawyer means exhausted immigration court appeals appealed 9th.

Appeals take time. sounds like deportable order placed, appealed.

has nice explanation deportation works etc.

 That's interesting way saying quit job.

I'm board decision, interesting way say it. feel like maybe I've COVID past 15 years based this. Imagine scenario. catch Corona, 20% chance need hospitalization. lungs literally cannot pump enough oxygen brain. hospitals backed cannot take you. do? problem meat, cold chain, virus survive months Praise CARROT! real issue power models, rather, made models, have. models tentative, prediction range wide susceptible wrong, see argument made people use shaky models shut entire world months/indefinitely. many lives, businesses, etc, destroyed lockdown, covid -- now, years come via economic recession/depression. I'm way covid denier, see Neil Ferguson say 500,000 would die UK, week later testify say maybe around 20,000 -- yet UK countries still enacted policies first number still held true -- leaves baffled. sure ignorant. morbidly obese. parents don’t allow toddlers Twitter. clickbait? 

If hospitalized count? yeah, now. wait open borders especially westerners highest covid deaths. Netflix Canada great white north. Deaths definitely underestimated, everywhere. think things could make difference Texas.

1. Texas youngest population US, excluding DC.

2. Vitamin deficiency less thing Texas compared northern places

3. Areas hit worst Michigan large black population (who seem havd worse outcomes) compared Texas. Outside Houston many worse affected cities, like Amarillo, mostly white hispanic.

Texas Florida hot humid, large hispanic population, run anti science politicians maybe something it. current U.S. government death cult Trump head. point, shocking states allow entry placed without mask on. 5 - unless mean today. last couple weeks seems like least couple new ones day. Nah, know it’s people north. Well... shit. another year two. 5 million people could die virus conservative friends still say numbers padded 90 percent deaths way associated virus. could give rectal cancer pretty dumb it. way cures stupidity. go talk fo idiots r/Conspiracy “tHeSE nUMbErs faKe!!!!” Yes.

Besides, masks sign weakness. I'll wear ""pow wer ful"" red mega douche hat. know many call ""chi nyaa flew"" big ""demo krat"" hoax. I'd say agree, yes agree, make look bad. 

It's except testing, need stop tracks, testing, gone good. magnificent job, nobody would thought, likes we've never seen, kill it, like mild cold.

I agreed evidence anecdotal. that's need know. That's people say ""we're together"" response always that's gotdamn lie. got us first half gonna lie. Agent Orange certainly will.

I wrong getting better. actual reasons WWI pointless war resulted massive changes world. point weary negative hype virus. 
Fewer deaths good thing......right?

The facts this: COVID-19 real disease sickens some, proves fatal others, (mostly elderly) — nothing vast majority. -----That's it! Lots anger there. I’m sure when, many people totally lost minds. hope feel better. Life’s short angry time.  link explained pretty well. Looks like common method heavily skewed events given year. emergence another outbreak China, I'm seeing comments 'lab virus' 'new' strain China planning unleash us all.

Is evidence debunk this? scientists confirmed SARS-CoV-2 appear man made appears natural?

Edit: thanks downvotes guys. thought clearly implied believe this, hence I'm asking evidence way disprove crackpot conspiracy theorists. Come now, seperate wings Corporate oligarchy. Thank you, ive meaning look actual workouts, far I’ve sort going own. I’ll saving comment refer back haha reopening/memorial day ... far... think found new solution, blaming young people. stay home. state began reopening see people sitting outside restaurants. don’t trust science, government, media, anyone else anymore. stay home plague ends. politicians' handlers corporate friends supposed make $$$ that? That’s cool discrediting source gave another one everyone heard of. Great. even bigger percent stupid people living future. bunch folks get hopped unuseful, unearned optimism, go party like worst over, massively spread disease more. Rinse repeat. probably times economy longer able saved. There's long defer rent payments. Eventually landlords default mortgage foreclosed on. Buckle up. There's going rolling evictions, foreclosures bankruptcies. worst yet come. Orange County straight issuing dire warnings. looking forward next weeks  yah new cases definitely still high, though looks like less deaths last tuesdays nearly 1100 Chipotle, comes. Overman Castor going best suburbs keep blocking things. Every country place US citizens travel ban, clearly interest preventing diseases spreading keep dirty rats away. someone could seen coming. Gotta reopen even faster then... hour ago reversed course said worry (source: 

So yesterday Abbot told young people covid fault, today he's saying big deal, everyone (including him) recognizes getting worse Texas. Maybe, know crazy, maybe stop talking let doctors dictate health policy change. quit assholes wear masks church, would solve problem nobody would issues open Yeah talked protesting days past someone reddit said get cane Karen, I'm like man, that's harsh. Although Karen class.. another popular name time wrong fail understand: both.

Yes, blame individuals. lot dumbass people there, blame them. garden variety morons, know this.

We also blame leadership, lacking understanding without forcing complete idiots serve best interest, convenient. Leadership know morons exist, choose smart ethical path unless forced.

So yes, blame leadership, entire job wrangle morons best place us, morons included. can’t remember state was, lady stepped position working governor Covid task force 

That California. right, Sweden anyone speaking Swedish strategy tends end subjected kind orchestrated trolling harassment consistently gain kind prominence. gets worse visible prominent are. me, random Redditor bunch suspicious accounts mass downvoting, harassing, stalking, mass reporting etc. instance, one prominent critical Swedish academic deleted twitter due vile trolling abuse got speaking out. 

It's interesting since tactics similar ones climate change deniers use climate scientists activists. even interesting big oil actually *also* funds anti-lockdown voices. wrote bit longer piece links: also article abuse many critics Sweden face ITT. 

It's deal US: anti-lockdown/NPI voices often tend nasty abusive. sometimes get way, sadly, case CA. Nice know nonexistent untested vaccine available low cost.

Shades grey isnt thing guys it? using corticosteroids respiratory patients (ARDS, pneumonia, COPD, asthma, croup etc.) ED decades. new breakthrough intervention. cheap, effective already widely used. Perhaps result demonstration starting come in. literally told us cases go test less. never said certainty. said mean time, woman made blood donations pass antibodies.

People giving shit data 2 3 months old. case hours old.

Please try keep up. mask cannot contain full exhalation two lungs. there’s anything confuses pandemic it’s antimask stance. wrong country putting mask public save lives controversial. 45 thinks it’s un-manly. wimpy librul snowflakes wear masks.

Well, people empathetic consider lives besides value. 45 emphatically not. Corona Mai! clean seven multiple times day job. want to, believe me. actually wish people would stay more. would make job easier playing around there. heckerooni got guys knickers? seem like stand gent.  true, one reasons population level testing _hard_.

The previous version 5% false positive rate, made essentially useless. one least _mostly_ real positives, makes least somewhat useful.

Also test somewhere *between* 0 0.3% FP, hope real number lower. 17 covid. crazy. ok? Trump fuck. LIBERATE STATE! - Trump

Well congrats Texas, one first re-open, people free oppression sensible reasonable government trying get terrible situation control. get witness happens people try handle situation (hint: well apparently). Strong leadership needed guide masses. access internet doesnt suddenly make stop believing world isnt flat covid isnt spread 5G wireless. right. We're going die. End story. We're setting records across country! Who's sick winning yet? Right, say 'Cases rising US' mean 'Cases rising parts US'.

That's definition cherry picking. Coronavirus needs this... Or, like glorious leader says, stop testing virus. Watch quickly cases go zero. watched tim tracker. videos paint different picture said. exception universal studios Florida. Wrestling, Alcohol Religion scream America already?  Dang Smiths (kroger) don’t that. first masks mandatory state Neither you, would seem. I've depressed really want DeSantis one finally decide time go. Coronavirus likes this... Ha. I’m worried folks sneeze dyson driers Thank god. TX honestly I’ve seeing mixed bag people wearing masks I’ve mocked yelled twice younger group only... yelling “OMG get it’s flu” I’d also say maybe 25% people wearing masks 50% employees 75% wearing noses around necks... feel way effect spread protests....I’m also right boarder podunk redneck country... also kept Robin Tunney alive Vertical Limit. principle, mitigation means ""letting everyone get it"", spreading enough hospitals overwhelmed. latter part probably impossible; something like 5% people need hospitalization, average stay 1-2 weeks would take years get through. substantial savings made protecting elderly. Simply based metric total deaths, testing workers nursing homes constantly (which Florida doing) cut deaths significantly.

By contrast, containment simply means letting everyone get it. keep R value 1 long takes eliminate it. countries world - every first-world country except Sweden - doing.

In practice, places might end switching one other. Sweden currently mitigating (and effectively, slowing spread keep hospitals overwhelmed, mostly keeping away elderly), since nobody else Europe going open borders them, economy crashing result end sight, they'll contain eventually. mitigation efforts make containment easier point, since many immunity they've never really let get ""out hand"". contract, 30% weekly growth see many US states simply going lead either lock hospitals overrun sometime July August.

It mistake confuse lockdowns either mitigation containment. Countries locked completely squandered chance plan, found without testing March weeks mass deaths. Places squander chance - like Korea Taiwan - contained ease without lockdown. Sweden unique planned advance, prepared mitigation rather containment, concept applies. Lockdown panic move due planning, part real plan. Good thing GOP put place corporate protections Covid resulting law suits last month, assholes... Health care worker less. WTF! site called allsides I've gone part. list articles relating lean...so list article particular issue left leaning site...a right leaning site one dead center. 

They've online 12 years think...and they're breath fresh air. seen, notable level contact tracing happening right AZ. Womp womp. Probably didnt wear mask, probably didnt social distance. IFR less 0.2%. Every antibody study shown far. Without lockdown would results. new york, people got COVID people isolation. Again, argue want, without appropriate controls, speculate. point. speculating ifs buts. Yeah, shown wonderful prop#ganda machine reddit is.

Say come reddit moderate liber#l views shaped experience society. see people posting things really make sense ultimate goal transitioning s#cialist society. say something like, ""while agree healthcare fundamental right, I'm sure great idea give people enough money live nothing like UBI. Maybe targeting social safety nets towards can't find work better."" wind -14 several people writing diatribes wrong.

So next time post, knowing subject unpleasant feelings, change things up. avoid talking UBI, wind +5 several people affirming opinions socialized healthcare.

Now posting say opinion anymore. posting get dopamine hit. brain lights see +112 upvotes. get excited see orange ""1"" messages box, excited see ""3"" ""9"".

You realize long loud spouting ""correct"" opinion, get dopamine hit, regardless whether assertions right. Sometimes even say things sources. feeling have, fits narrative. matter. Upvotes. ""This."" ""You right."" ""Absolutely.""

You even read articles anymore. exist comments section. read headline post first thing comes mind get +2K continuous stream orange message notifications. moderate before, think Biden basically Rockefeller. posting redditisms long getting positive reinforcement ideas managed convince entirely correct. read left media only, educate soci#alist talking points fully dismantle casuals debate moderate talking points.

Either this, turned initial reaction views wind going complete opposite direction falling welcoming arms far right.

No one comes reddit educated. come bury bubble (sub) similar viewpoints continuous dopamine hit. makes manipulating opinions incredibly easy. social media like this, exactly we're existing p#rtisan era American history.

#'s avoid censorship p#litical possibly one p#litical subs reddit.

I post again, removed delusional mods again... Trump want draw attention covid19. illuminates poorly managed crisis poorly led nation. wants make seem like big deal, 120K people die every day.

Since wear mask, people around justifiably afraid fired wear one. re-election. Uh... concrete suggestions individuals could change federal government's financial decisions ""today tomorrow""? 

I watching waiting COVID-19 numbers. soon safe enough, intend get personally involved town's civic process. ethical eye keeping watch budget negotiations get done million angry comments Internet. But... next time. one, we're going ride through. Let's hope keep country time. Yeah freezer trucks chill beer party gonna covid. imagine loud person constantly talking yelling parties night clubs. men want watch world burn. covid app shows 4,400. Bro 17 ppl know died! Can’t shut country forever True among worst. few, any, media outlets consistent unbiased/non-agenda'ed/non-misleading behaviors comment regarding question protests sounds incredibly miserable, accounts would considered “mild” case. Horrible awful virus is. Glad you’re continuing improve! Mmhmm yes. going happen. #Winning first employee matter. Facts go narrative welcome.. Wearing mask easy enough always inside. Staying away people may decade? bit harder. change socialisation &amp; meeting new people clear we're likely going long time? “Bro” Oh lol thought OP. Ye agree you, post stupid. live basically every trend going right direction right now....naturally means opening even stuff right tourists harder hit areas pouring in. Keep mind us indoctrinated. us fortunate enough receive adequate educations taught skepticism early age. know US fucked country. know infant mortality rate shameful humiliating. know teachers adequately trained therefore cannot hope properly educate children. know televised news form reality entertainment ignored. 

We're loud mouthed foolishly confident. hard hear us noise outright assault truth. 

Be vigilant let what's happening US happen country. Yeah, makes sense. Thanks. decent spin workouts YouTube, found already. also like Bike-O-Vision Spinervals DVDs, found Amazon. 

Spinervals also website download spin videos demand. owner former triathlete puts together challenging workouts. One things like turn music play own, still getting coached. need accept nihilism's cool, friendly embrace. come work you? No, ABSOLUTELY conflicting messaging even going New York. news articles media reports LOVE focus people gathering outdoors, especially beaches, hiking trails, parks.

But even cursory glance peer reviewed studies date articles contact traced outbreaks (mostly outside U.S. since, ya know, hysterical, reactionary stance everything instead calmly tracing origin outbreak) shows airborne transmission INDOORS prime mover COVID 19. stale air recirculated air, low ceilings seem play part, PROLONGED exposure infected individual. likelihood transmission without masks space (funerals, churches, bars, night clubs, restaurants, offices) infected person sneezes goes astronomically since there's enough viral load single sneeze symptomatic person infect 1,000 people. Masks obviously help, even indoors masks used people sitting spot long periods time, transmission still occurs.

By way, mentioned New York earlier guarantee city lets people back offices, infections rise they'll blame everywhere EXCEPT offices. I'd love proven wrong, nobody seems interested looking offices forcing people work states never really shut source outbreaks NY media (I live area) seems focus crowded sidewalks parks. subway, buses, offices, meanwhile, proven outbreak sources contact traced studies. Essential, perspective powers be: replaceable. 

Until make power necessity felt, continue exploited. 

There general strikes workers armed protect force change, people desperate conditioned way system works imagine possibility. Forget what? Arizona's Tucson Medical Center reported one intensive care unit (ICU) bed left yesterday. sure isn’t another answer?
Why aren’t coughing showing symptoms?
maybe aren’t sick? tried dexamethasone before? caveat numbers include data previously may excluded....that prison system. happened yet, won't. kinda expect something similar Gov Abbot TX said today. weeks DeSantis tell us stay home need outdoors. feeling things continue like one day like oh fuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

 conversation someone work yesterday. Told binary issue whether die not. may die, mean disease taken lightly. He's mid 30s showed article local guy hospital 17 days ventilator. normal healthy 44 year old guy survived likely horrible experience.  still know much disease either. 

""I bad shape. I'm healthy. I'm 44. underlying issues. get someone like 44 honestly, can't take lightly personally."" already twice bad regular flu year, we're half way year, took shutting fucking world get numbers ""good"". really think amount evidence change peoples minds. healthcare worker broad term Sure, underreporting overreporting. Check excess death figures see that. Enforce

Here's works 

Download maskhole app smartphone

When leave house, app turns on

Every time see someone without mask public, take picture phone's camera, automatically send picture cloud, noting time date. take picture , fake 'camera click' sound replaced tiny voice says 'maskhole'.

Once sent maskhole cloud, facially recognized, stored, unique face registered.  time huge database faces covered public multiple times exist.

You also prove maskhole. leave house maskhole app prompt take selfie, course mask.

How would help?

If things go bad, hospital resources scarce, start snapping pics patients. find maskhole, bring attention healthcare workers let human nature takes course.

Just thought Great points. never great statistics end running numbers understand them. That's can't use hand dryers. filled doo doo particles toilet plumes. Dang family way back March carriers wouldn’t repair towers lol.. let everything sort out... keep charging non existing service . based history. wash, rinse repeat.  One party that. 45 pocket why. young people testing positive spread to? hospitalizations ticking up? aware 1/4th population 65? Fucking God way impeach stupid governor? allowed participate process innovating better way. ""The first night go out."" went day bars opened, comment clearly going continue got infected. sure Murphy's law.  [click downvoted this. state subreddit. insurance pay 200€ max year. job/low pay 0. Infectious diseases tend get less deadly longer exist, species. there's too. hate people panic “new cases”. increased testing (which goal) you’re going find lot people already. I’ve told epidemiologist Pay attention deaths average age deaths. actually suggesting IFRs even remotely comparable? Around 1/3rd world population infected. death toll estimated 1-6% worlds population. results IFR 3-18 fucking %.

CDC estimates sars cov 2 IFR around .26% meta analysy Ioannidis gives value. 

None even bothers adjust expected years living lost, arguably important.

99% spanish flu deaths age 65.

Go ahead read symptoms caused age group affected. Implying CoVid deaths could get even remotely close spanish flu laughable. Yeah, feel like need keep posting articles. gonna repetitive point Stockholm syndrome? Italy Spain deployed military enforce lockdowns.

Never unemployment, eh? first time too, lol - learning experience.

They'd let us go keep employees line, I'd imagine - pandemic assistance run outweigh find new job.

They'd know A.) quarantine order prevented us appearing work b.) unemployment insurance checks employer.

We're at-will state.  2020: year dodo plumes became thing... nurses worst ""do say do"" lots fat nurses, lots nurses smokers.

consider too, healthcare worker broad term. pharmacy techs CNAs high school diploma+6 weeks training. saying people go college can't intelligent diligent, odds favor. You’d think God fearing Christian are, less you’d likely tempt God. help billions upon billions dollars meant small businesses went billion dollar corporations.  even trying hide theft now. source this? Seems like pretty big statement make. They’ve added many phrases automod auto-delete I’m trying avoid catchphrases LOL people care think? lol, called multiple times actually test though? Trumpism? unironically, southern governors speeding reopening never dragging feet waiting week becomes clear disaster looming take away ammo lets that. make good point, wish true. need people thought big deal, get sick, speak up. like idiots going listen us trust science ideology. wish someone repugnant Biden. would landslide historic proportions. one cares think Right? asking?
I never gave much crap anywho. Yeah...

""I stopped things prevented bad thing, bad thing happened. Murphy's law!"" overdramatic people like dude wanted virus way serious mad wife considered essential.  employers really good 100% behind working home much can.  wife sick presumed covid mid March-mid April worked home entire time (my work critical keep utility services operational) even though miserable. wife least got 2 weeks paid sick time covid told work felt better. claimed 1 3 ventilators. getting 1 8? Bingo. Hence tries even talk it. Ditto ongoings regarding police. 

He's sticking 2020 game plan probably wrote last year That's get 'more testing = infections' thinking. I'm assuming vast majority people feel sick going get tested hell (not including antibody testing) put near others likely sick seeking testing. random door-to-door nasal swabs, logic might make sense.  Yep. work retail I'm also person clean shitters. trying everything think keep co workers safer. customers still go behave like feral hogs. unfortunately several co workers too, get big place. Seems unlikely would happen covid die something else though. Odds least contributory factor. Murphy's law one time quote Murphy's law actually Murphy's law? ain’t way I’m ever gonna love 

... maybe wrong song No, higher proportion since population lower data collection much worse. went target Texas town. middle age older people weren’t wearing masks. ones wearing looked mostly 30. would say maybe 30% shoppers mask. employees wore them. Thank god yearly forum like site seasonal flu. think noodle could take doomers continuously place spout daily outbreak fatality numbers saying gonna die leave house life. enough little group. far late Herd Immunity, billions people sacrificed lives livelihood millions. 

Herd immunity benefits 99.5% population relatively unaffected. mass unemployment, depression/suicides, increase home abuse, substance abuse, rioting, etc...

But flatten curve get those.

Its decision, help 99.5% 0.5%. cannot help both. Sorry know mean. search Coronavirus - found me. happened end February either complications B12 direct effect massive coincidence. I've posted longer comments message thread detailing detail feel free look comment history. lol, going wild 2 weeks keep suggesting wait act. 

I'm procrastinating actions. waiting? Sure, cant protests coronavirus racism. memorial day reopening

The bias disgusting point. fooling anyone consider credible sources. Florida one listed countries ""on brink"" due ""poverty war"" article states. could least *try* disingenuous garbage pushing. Fuck science. Bring dead. think care herd immunity either. think comes money. Specifically theirs. I'm canada still havent even left house 3 months since reason still going strong lol Probably COVID19 came from. Timewave zero look website below, number areas Arizona seems getting worse. would include things like: number ICU beds used covid-19 patients, number ventilators used covid-19 patients, course not. fecal matter gets toothbrushes house/room cleaners come stick bums. housekeeper knows, we're people simply brush teeth. Cuzzzzz DON’T stop referring concerns virus “panic”? Taking threat seriously absolutely level headed rational thing do. quote Joe Rogan ""Masks pussies."" can't pin one politicians. waves right-wing protests *massive* waves civil rights/anti-cop protests riots. propaganda, facts gleaned chinese media:

* index cases appear 5 food inspectors tasked particular beijing seafood wholesaler came contact imported seafood
* extensive testing wholesale markets Beijing, traces contamination detected imported meat seafood

* cases spread overwhelmingly concentrated food service industry, including chefs servers, shows 1) power masking prevent community transmission 2) strongly food related outbreak
* Surprisingly, government testing imported food samples Shanghai Guangzhou also revealed contaminated meats, absent beijing markets also markets China deal imported food.

The internet consensus wechat/weibo starting coalesce around either really unlucky break conspiracy. Increasing amounts people think deliberate introduction kick second wave, since inspections imported meat corona routine now.

edit: forgot mention sequencing contaminated salmon cutting board strain showed european variant predominant europe america asian one found wuhan Trump-tards WallyMart wearing masks. Jesus crust, yes crust. San Antonio checking in, holy hell, EVERYWHERE everyone like “well back normal” see many social distancing, masks. fucked honestly feel point too. You’re right. don’t agree decisions, it’s prerogative. 

FWIW it’s gonna years us, (you I) we’ll fall forced vaccine guinea pigs then. It’ll years plays globally sure. Could linger small town USA maybe big cities quite too.

We wasted three months still contact tracing, still great testing places, horrific mask use. 

It’s late. run concurrently means reduce spread lessen hospital stay isolate infected.

The database won’t work America people fight good, pragmatic ideas instead want open states despite clearly rising cases. state following even meager edited CDC guidelines. Couldn’t describe better also try avoid problems ignoring them.

Granted, problems things like much chaos clutter garage, global pandemic killing hundreds thousands Americans.... dad 90s got sepsis years ago. care facility attached hospital month. mentioned glad insurance covering charging around 20k, day. 

So yeah, 200k ten days sounds right, also kind low, since i've read, intensive care beds, require person hours keep people alive.  Okay but, isn’t job right now? Cause THATS recommended.

I'll say again... again... again. anywhere inside recirculated stale air, smaller space (lower ceilings especailly) potentially exposed indoor airflow long period time infected individual. 

It ain't beaches, ain't parks, aint' crowded sidewalks. fact many states seeing huge upticks spending long periods time AC. 

In many states, offices never really told close. Even restaurants bars closed some, lot offices never did, peer reviewed papers transmission, offices major source outbreaks. 

The reason rail offices that, quite literally NOBODY talking source. Shithead employers middle management types forcing people work could work home they're getting away it. country done detailed contact tracing traced major outbreaks offices - first link South Korea, nearly entire floor became infected but, curiously, nobody rode elevator did. Airborne transmission, man... sitting inside AC day help. Even many restaurants bars, especially near beach, fresh air flowing through. Yea... get impression parents over-exagerating safe worry much.

The picture emerges new working paper based economists’ findings economy frozen place. Simply declaring economy “reopened” seem anything spur high-income people spend more, it’s clear anything real threat passes.”

Reality right here, although Gov media make people feel/think different order keep economy/market chugging alone.

We are.... frozen time. I'm positevely surprised fast everyone started wearing masks around here, honest.

Even low mortality rate, elevated risk hospitalization long duration stay makes situation bad even without death. Plus, may end long term lung damage among things.

Meanwhile people browsing sites collect share cookies seem mind any. know possible we're talking average rent.

Idk someone works grocery store lives near LA NYC. still need grocery stores right? bout 3 way tie national disgrace**

Pretty much sums whole response actually... Anecdotal, (and 4 roommates + friends) 9 protests past couple weeks (including record-breaking 100k Hollywood BLM one) tested negative two days ago. 

I’d never around nearly many people life yet 4 roommates didn’t get infected.

If protests condensed humans past year, shouldn’t equivalent uptick infections/deaths around (over 2 weeks since start protests)? I’m aware there’s increase doesn’t seem match sheer *enormity* human contact taken place past weeks. What’s that? Shouldn’t death/infection rate *skyrocketing* beyond past precedent?

Also, I’m asking bad faith. always cautionary side firmly believe country taking precautionary measures COVID. would 762 deaths per day. Seems pretty reasonable. sensational. (Antibody tests give insight whether likely need 1 test that) Stage 3 Live P-town, laws bay met wife. wife's sister husband looking. discussed house 850K nearly teardown. 14 offers far. 

Near new development going 400k consider overpriced. know people got good house exurb 220k. rent 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom house garage $1200 per month. that’s canada though highest single day hospitalization total NY 18,000 (April 12th-18, 825) hospitals Covid one day. think either Texas Florida able handle that, let's hope something changes. friends? Currently Midwest rent renewal exact same, new signers $100 hear friend. Houses insane right (I'm looking buy first one). priced 10% normal price $180k house looking sold day went market ~$210k 10+ offers made. 

No one area moving raising prices across board. Honestly, heard read virus January immediately purchased 1 box N95s box surgical masks. N95s made surgical masks never delivered. time started actively hitting news U.S. could find masks longer early February. 

The fact people take healthcare advice talking heads television, BS posts Facebook far infuriating supply hoarders. Knowing every song country less trending cases practiced wearing masks social distancing complete shutdowns clue. decision cause chaos panic avoid losing money... cost American lives, still counting. Bit say ""Everyone wear N95 buy shortage?""

No... March 31st addressed masks. entire comment chain too. bet wont win one last time Health Authority reported 100 deaths May 15th (117 deaths then). always note there’s lag reporting backlog etc. briefing today there’s one tomorrow. population rabidly hoarding anything everything 

So population wear improvised masks (face coverings) later mandated anyway? civil suit, prove things preponderance evidence.

The COVID-19 waiver gym says staff sanitize workout equipment sessions don't. might enough. masks give free work, yet still get people day refuse wear freely provided mask. virus attending both, respect. understand concept, generally agree. think chinese need get high horse. president flailing well, iron fist. kinda rich country limited freedoms start judging freedoms president turn hair 360 degrees. looks like major powers (incl russia) losing control people flailing like fell plane.

Its bizarre proud bullying people like fo wear mask.

Which part uneducated things work?

You obviously selfish simply care people want wear mask. KNOW people care wearing mask simply dismiss that. I’m sure would relegated told that’s health insurance, using PTO, going state disability run PTO, expected come back work health restored.

Oh, yes, totally forgot that! mean, yeah, options! Tell truth &amp; Americans hoard &amp; leave healthcare workers none, tell lie.

Yup, right! best 2 possible paths.

March8th-

LaPook, March 8: There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.

LaPook: You’re sure it? people listening really closely this.

Fauci: …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.

LaPook: get schmutz, sort staying inside there?

Fauci: course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s fine.

LaPook: lead shortage masks?

Fauci: Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it.

Some key points there:

- Masks effective preventing spread infected person

- Widespread adoption could lead shortage healthcare workers

As someone works industry, tell time comments made already supply chain problem. Hundreds thousands masks leaving US headed overseas activity began back December. time Fauci made comments, mask supply already bad. Wish like HIV,where one actually something catch it
Unfortunately Bolsonaro supporters go supermarkets everyone else :/ people worried anti-lockdown protests? much smaller kept physical distance generally. Ah. Yeah Texas wild hear. ok though I'm sure dude thinks overreaction flu kills way people conspiracy get people vaccinated million stupid takes Follow medical professionals advise? recommendation reopen least 2 week trend declining cases. never saw downward trend all. leveled stopped going governor called good started reopening. Also spencerschmudde said mask wearing requirement would would help also recommended medical community. Strong leadership governor cared people bad either. Instead businessman worried businesses lives. pic accompanying article, looks 70+. 

It might white beard, maybe position looks bit slumped (could got car). It’s question economics consumer choice. Students want live own. don’t need fifty thousand dollars that. need loans. fiction “university experience” reach good five years. Sorry. is. wrong decision. could advised people make masks home.

When publicly came said wear masks, still weren’t available people first place. searched online hours could find any.

I felt like living alternate reality trying tell family members needed wear masks. couldn’t find online, sent instructions make masks home. sent links CDC recommendations, thought conspiracy theorist told CDC lying. 

They changed tune CDC backtracked statement, don’t see anyone trusts point. doing? Zero information severity illness, ages anything helps us draw significant conclusion whether virus mutated become weaker, therefore safer return public life. make assumptions half information. panic headlines agree. able prove wasn’t reinfected never completely recovered. fact struggling illness months. really wish news spending time educating public would encourage people cautious. aren’t talking movie box office earnings here. 

No one saying Covid19 deaths impactful society, point merit. face value, Americans died Covid19. Stop trying church up. 

But, going Church up, please remotely consistent. April 6th, 1917 Americans entered war. November 11th, 1918 left war. 585 days. 

First reported death end February, [but appears first Covid19 happened February 6th. leads 132 days. 

So, shouldn’t include amount days comparison? worse? soon, still 500k deaths remaining that, we’ll eventually get there

It “funny” people don’t quarantine, get sick, can’t get hospital bed blame governors, even though hospital beds multiplied 4 crisis. expect, medics ventilators expand numbers indefinitely? early days outbreak, testing limited. showed hospitals presenting severe respiratory symptoms would given test hospital.

with testing availability, folks mild symptoms able get tested...increasing pool recover compare get seriously ill against.

also, ( now) done decent job limiting random interactions.

that said-- states reopened showing increasing hospitalization rates possible weeks trend might hold steady reverse itself. would grrreeeaaat! huge run respirators hospital's since there's many people coronavirus? seems shutdown many cases overtake hospitals. tons tons cases hospital still flooded patients. true, would different weather forecasts. 

Regardless, saying every time need walk anywhere (which laptop, apparently), check weather forecast? Snowbirds gone there’s bunch people visiting missed chance quarantine. 

My town filled jackasses. say things like “thank wearing mask” think many COVID testiing sites even shut down, even destroyed actually. heard many reports this. So, testing sites happen them, could many silent spreaders walking around, without tested. obvious anyone 2 brain cells. 

They said recommended general public, recommend health workers contact covid patients.

Why would recommend healthcare work? kids getting sick school? chance. 2024 perhaps? thank god, wasnt sure side arnold on. arnold never lets down. fucking idiot wouldnt wear mask right now. Yeah hopefully okay hittin clubs then? Remember tried warn us back December one listened. Well done Taiwan, should’ve listened stop testing people won’t new cases! Stop testing people, problem solved! /s engage, they're troll withholding information, particularly life-saving info, lying problem that. Esp now, LOST CREDIBILITY. I.  
   
How else handle nation impulsive incredulous idiots?  
 
Did see happened toilet paper fucks sake? foolish outraged this. one thing governments need crisis credible. Even 1/2 country find president credible, would still expect experts like Dr. Fauci Surgeon General tell truth (let alone WHO). mask thing obvious lie people beganto disregard messages public health officials.

I legit felt awkward &amp; guilty wearing first - since knew shitty take healthcare pros. But, again, damn thing used &amp; 15 years old! Students want live home remote learning. absolutely nothing parents. know, look Beijing, get 100 cases, whole city shut down, Texas Arizona getting several thousand NEW cases DAY, hospitals filled almost capacity, nothing done there. say, states taken care of, hotspots going spill states, states brought virus control. remember Cuomo even bringing guy hotspot state could come New York State infect people, know it, hard work drain. Hi 50 cent Yeah back March. Worst sickness I've ever had. Completely ass. appears virus almost areas implemented lockdown returning normal. Testing increased lot think new cases people who’re either asymptomatic light symptoms. Still, states maintain lockdown. Schools offices still closed, restaurants either closed, offer curbside services outside seating. virus comeback, could come back even fall. hope vaccine arrive winter. get vaccine go clinic full potentially sick people get it?? AMA somehow keep us updated? Varying degrees intelligence guess. probability people get infected others sitting room drastically higher people outside. enclosed space makes difference. That's load crap. ride bus, catch virus. Someone house brings home, catch it.

There's many ways catch 2021? literally did. That's I'm saying. ""essentially royalty"" there? 

Dude God there. That’s good. guys smart fare well probably. rigid system put place, safer population. evil translates ""calamity""

Yeah, I've heard apologetics lol. Step 1: Kill voter base

Step 2: ?? Source? Numbers find look like 0.5%, higher preexisting conditions.  might now. know people still hoarded N95s. mother I’m sure would’ve loved able wear one working NICU alas, Karen need 6 years N95s keep safe They're literally exactly same. advocating political beliefs. Open testing unfortunately used make assumptions infection rates.


They randomized tests that. ""Di du dua di"" starts playing... discuss ppe hired them? Come uk still 5000 cases day - 150 deaths daily yet lockdown... yay.. Trumps interested things work 100% time, small time stuff like masks. Biggly solutions = biggly results. /s Yeah wonder long first covid infection hits them? know bound happen. handle that? plans it? Thank explanation Tests still taking longer week results, still capped test capacity  Damn that's crazy, cost probably high never use market.

You guys get Fuuuucked asthma COPD though, soon step steroid inhalers price roof. never said world ender. noted thing far worse nonchalant attitude makes seems. compare things already completed totally kiss point virus still going on. We’re still getting infected, still losing lives, still seeing families disrupted, still seeing economies fail...and it’s done. I’d ask kindly shut fuck comparisons entirely invalid. I’d also ask stop stalking across threads like kind psycho. 20 people added weekend 6th June alone. National day sloppiness?

Argh, I'm nervous this. Intellectually, feel quite certain DK's Test, Trace, Isolate deal this. emotionally still upsetting degree. support right protest, think good *the whole time* (even lockdown strict) always 100% legal Denmark hold protests size. Still, risky. Let's hope none infected superspreaders. 

FWIW know several protests, already tested came back negative. Anecdata data ofc, heartening sign anyway. personal preference people wear mask? definitely preference people want wear mask.

You trying force personal preference people will, wearing mask’ WHAT? 😂😂😂. Again, can’t personality. It’s something even though it’s minor minor discomfort

Different strokes different folks. people prefer wear mask, people don't. acknowledge minor minor discomfort major major discomfort don’t leg stand don’t care wearing masks ‘personal responsibility’, also rely society around cater needs wants

I don't, like said rely society cater needs wants. tell people wear wear mask, them.

Why take personal responsibility ? like wear mask, avoid them, isolate yourself. automatically removed referred coronavirus-related subreddit quarantined reddit admins, stated may contain misinformation hoax content.

Because people realizing government media interested informing us truth, letting us process respond information rational way. Instead lied us produce desired response. 

If government mainstream media willing lie us COVID-19, else willing lie us about? true death toll certainly higher state's official count. routine add two three dozen deaths tally every afternoon. day, Texans catching virus might kill them.

State officials trying prevent state’s focus preventing deaths costs, reopening gradually enough hospitals become overwhelmed. question much death bear, many deaths system manage?

I also disagree preventative care attractive insurance companies even young people. get 20 year old vaccinated worried get sick go hospital, get 20 year old vaccinated 55 year old mother who's vaccine take correctly ends getting sick sending blue cross blue shield enormous bill.   Fauci: masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else

If they're lying, lied also said reduces chance get infected? personally (and 99% everybody else) give really shit random people grocery store say prevents wearer getting sick? 

If would said that, near universal mask use people care others, completely normal. thinking people would willing wear mask ""helps prevent infecting others"" got one dumbest statements make. Let's say homemade mask 50% effective rather N95 95% effective. wear homemade mask wear homemade mask, chance infecting 4 times lower.

That’s exactly asked sources counter point see sub awful fall/winter going be. haven’t seen heard much anyone suggesting opposite.

We've watched waited long enough. data need.  much family. Sad face too.  live North Central Florida I'm frankly terrified even though county alright people town taking seriously not. wish we'd put proper test-and-trace place knew &lt;:/ Wow, I'd never tell someone remove mask buy alcohol. line. Thank wearing mask! Yay science! Thirded! that's true, proven within next month so. rate COVID-19 spiking several states right now. followed expected deaths, well, would data point need. I'm still watching waiting. Personally, endorse really complex radical theory read New York Times. hard explain well, basically posits likelihood mask-wearer mocked scoffed highly dependent things like wearer's geographical location particular demographics location.


I know, know, sounds pretty far-fetched first. around 0.03 seconds diligent sustained thought matter, decided yes, guess make sense.


That's me, though. see old folks masks time stores now. Lol, even don’t develop vaccine, they’ll say did. It’s win win them. person right mind would get vaccine developed China Chinese virus. no! NO! Wait first wave finished?!?!?!  rotations school become pharmacist, amazing see patients make crazy turn arounds overnight.

They're useful bunch situations, taking quickly also cause patients immediately revert back square one. Okay Boomer NYC virus control finally along rest northeast. Shut already.  want like that... doorknob. That’s N95 masks lot people can’t get. cloth masks essentially useless.

Edit: downvotes? I’ve followed virus everyday since January. N95 masks greatly prevent getting surgical masks greatly prevent spreading it. Fauci said himself. sub something else lol. There’s way make kids socially distance.

Your essentially teaching “other humans dangerous, stay away” impressionable age. It’s way damaging. shouldn’t send back till there’s social distancing.  Yes. 

But put number people inside, I’m saying. 

Same goes 0 degrees -10 degrees. fucking cold worth outside speak millennials? sounds like whiny bitching: oh I'll X people too! Screw selfish mentality. reading disability?

The article links CDC's documents... yeah case curious plot raw data hospitalization Texas due COVID time. day clear catalyst case. I'm sure cheap long. :/ &amp; anyway, they're right next other, already text instead talking realized toothbrush thing years back kept lid ever since. Plus keeps pets drinking toilet water.  currently? Yeah, seen fine Yeah powers keep us locked afraid forever guess... hohum... DC lobbying group? Darwinism all. job?  Huh? absolutely worse. factor large increase population. HS baseball/softball training usually includes *ton* indoor workouts weight rooms. Careful edge boi ""dogshit"" overdramatic people. hospitals overrun, deaths decreasing etc.

Calm fuck already Apparently major outbreaks history got way worse fall. outbreak needs somewhat contained else death toll climb significantly winter. virus still kill it’s immune system doesn’t enough. It’s delicate balance. makes sense since steroids inhibit immune system producing inflammation histamine response, inflammation kills COVID. literally swells cells lung passage ways thats die COVID. pleasant way go thats sure. there’s vaccine decent treatment actually saves enough lives, not? Pump full propaganda hope enough geezers hang vote November. EXCELLENT! Thanks! That's misinterpretation. Airborne transmission implied indoor outdoor transmission. 

I said public health protocols need focus reducing indoor transmission rates, expressed second paper. I'm sure New Yorkers would agree. infectious 2-3 days notice symptoms. supposedly church La Grande implicated.  call good news. like bad news spread corona faster! need breathe stale movie theater air filled corona 2 hours anytime soon!  not, serious virus think people go work fever fun.
Probably going get fired.

In case, still go work even thermal imaging -- course taking quick medication lower temperature entry. going go away time soon. matter well state people poorly run states flock there. needed strong federal leadership never going happen current leaders.  Yeah, love going movies, would trust going theater long time. Good them. change data. amazing turn events. could've predicted it... one people infecting others. working well ""In dental tribune"" Give fucking break. Unless link actual CDC site. Get fuck garbage. also extremely unlikely. Pull mask first health care worker people known better? RemindMe! 15 days USA!!! USA!!

We special! Sunlight vitamin D. B12 something makes red blood cells stomach. I've tested antibody blood came back positive, means can't digest B12. 

My B12 levels went repeatedly 3 months since discharged hospital later found coronavirus, level low blood tests can't give actual figure. I'm diagnosed pernicious anaemia numerous blood tests diabetes Kidneys etc. Hospitalizations Well that’s concerning anything. /s

Stay safe there. can't compare political rallies reaction recent current event. Rallies highly organized events massive budgets. able hold safely. many months election, reason happen week cases rising. universities US actually pretty decent compete universities like Oxford, PSL Research University Paris, Swiss Federal Institute Technology Zuric, etc. 

Admittedly k-12 education sucks even though spend per student almost western developed countries. 

There several competing theories is. answer, understand due high number school-age kids living poverty, lack resources kids living poverty, crappy healthcare, unnecessary overhead administrative costs. bottle brought, server *dispense* liquids. Play football. Outside small risk, probably young people, exercising socializing bad immune system. This. take pizza joint north, supposedly using masks gloves. Shut Hepatitis. orders get shots. Wtf? got through, else there? Sort like deciding value based fake Lancet paper data. comparing level devastation, ratios matter. genocides considered devastating. Provide literally one example positive spirits, people dying. Kate Brown done incredible job.  Rates going See that's great hypothetical super appreciate condescending possible telling family missing vacation Jamaica means deaths Nigeria. whole thread we've talking deaths covid US. said shutdowns would cause deaths covide never bothered let us know actually meant ""globally"" ""way way line like maybe next year."" piss garbage argument. vaccine. Hey, working America, too! Holy get jail sentences murdering stealing well people still it. FWIW, agree, mandated 3 weeks. People still listen though. Brazoria big County. way giving everyone middle finger. virus joke here, we’re thrilled low positive rate right people happily wear masks required.   position offensive people dying now, loved ones. 

I understand agenda - l really don't. People dying significantly higher rates normally would time year. Four times number people died COVID19 year would usually die flu. serious consider serious? testing? Besides tests good. Deaths ICU reliable statistics. except FDA agrees Lancet would issue toilet especially it’s shared. It’s shown spread vent systems well. keep toilet lid closed flushing, neighbours less likely get sick breathing plume *might get transmitted air duct system shared amongst multiple units.* major study done SARS outbreak 2003 apartment building, believed caused via transmission viral particles via duct system. extra filter add extra protection too. neighbours. nice backlight good visual illustration water vapor.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* deaths start declining ^(when susceptible already dead...)  right. drug useless. even FDA mean protesting increased? I’m betting see spikes unfortunately. That's overall excess deaths chart like asked though, that's covid-attributed deaths chart. neat wear surgical mask top mine cover valve instead laughing potentially infecting others virus. Pretty easy. pot calling kettle black. wasnt surprising, wasnt used sooner? I've coming back sub weeks simply people *do* say time, hilarious. even worse month ago good chunk people around preaching left house faced certain death. think they're prison. good transmission less likely staff leave. people feed nonsense persuaded it’s time let quarantine rest lives cause virus deadly contagious would already gotten it. deal Walmart, ignore shaming. tried explaining virus doesn’t follow customers like little rain cloud education system Mississippi everything heard is. Trying stay optimistic I’m afraid see explosion cases coast. People casinos beaches, masks, distance. Y’all pray 😓 need Technocracy ASAP. homeless one things almost everyone forgets. shut fuck up. even FDA declared scam Can’t second wave never dealt first wave Invest body bags  would too, RKI approved it. cases

nope. cases going up.

[here, since refuse starting totally plummet

the excess hospital capacity states cases help people Arizona, TX, Florida. hospitalizations going UP. I'm sure follow. would employer fire find collected unemployment? UI come employer directly somehow state? Here, employer incentivized way care offended somehow. UI paid employer per-employee employees working--what employer pays never changes based whether people actually end collecting. I'd say 10-15% folks wearing masks city north here. Given 5 active cases currently probably wearing. (4 one house travel related another travel related one neighbouring province self-isolated upon return) mention ""deep cleaning"" default *every fucking night* anyways, even covid shit. read that. Scary stuff. You’re right thing—just remember seems tiresome you’re keeping safe, also people come contact with. But, fair, non essential, (and are) shows audience. wrestlers would likely encounter 1-3 wrestlers week. Risk minimal consider sports essentially air decision made. wear cotton surgical mask it.  Except does! fades background noise, we'll get ignoring like every virus comes goes. Florida Arizona going disappear Easter ^^2021. Hahaha. thoughts exactly. need rednecks. Almost everyone ignores rules. that, far people get infected next months. boggles mind. reminds Oh lancet. 

Maybe retract study month write another political editorial Funny y’all used girl movie toilet 🤣🤣 they're scared, stay home like government telling us to? Agreed. would take vaccine china. Luckily warm weather kill thing off, cold regions like Brazil India problems. paying attention politics all? look calling accountability refusing provide it. tells need know. … piece tape vents. Wait comic cons start up.

I honestly want go except ones I'm working for. Dude. dad's county. Oh fuck heart sank little. think happening Brazil right now? India? take years full death toll calculated l said, we're already nearly half million know about.

Most countries' estimates 0.67-1% IFR (Ioanndis used selective data sets meta-analysis, excluded countries higher ones, pushes figures down) completely scale Spanish Flu. 

99% deaths Spanish Flu age 65 99% world's population - even accounting cytokine storm affect. 

You cannot say serious disease. calculation Spanish Flu 500x deadlier. nonsense. Yes imprecisness makes sound like solution white people stop racist. almost certainly case - scars already healing anti-racism program such. actually think could even misfire, lot black people realize anything given black people taken away political winds.

Ideally country shows cares everyone, including black people, deeply real way.

This very, different type problem solve white people racist.

But want problem like solved, talk something racism. Monumental hypocrisy. 
History show Abbott one take seriously opened everything. One would think since Native Americans seem susceptible illness whatever reason put greed health.

That's naive. they're oppressed minority mean they're also greedy dumb. vaccine. fire small side house! know percentage property is? small fire, I'm strong unafraid!! ray sun shining everyo--oh wait that's piss, sunshine. anti-president actively trying accelerate decline US. Thank you, President Fauci. Study Study even bothered typo lol people sit subreddit panicking day jobs? hobbies? feel like maybe wouldn’t worry much DNC loves shooting foot reason. think sheer incompetence required say ""yes, completely bland moderates like Biden Hillary exactly need"".

Yes, mediocre fast food far better food laced e coli restaurant health violations ass, striving better mediocre fast food. Still needs doctors prescribe Germany wont happen unless Robert Koch Institute approves it.

LOL guess ignore arguments suit reality read comment section.

I also one comment spin:

*Hey thing distracts point post??!*

*Hey thing killed bunch people??!* Duh Yet... ,,l,,(-_-),,l., fantastic news  ,,l,,(-_-),,l., Sounds like guys get married. would settle everything. offices actually nobody looking them. asshole employer care keeping people safe absolutely insists people office, gonna hold person accountable? even happening New York City, let alone rest country. Public Transit is, least, looked - even bars restaurants. Offices continue source nobody America talking many easy fix - let people work home. can't, invest air exchangers figure ways let people get fresh air every thirty minutes so. meetings conference room - like AT. ALL. 

I'm willing bet money many outbreaks Arizona states numbers going began offices never really closed many places begin with. I'm lucky enough work home, proven offices sources major outbreaks due windows open, recirculated stale air, sheer amount time workers spend inside. ,,l,,(-_-),,l., That's scares actually Nobody could seen coming... What's sad wife takes sinuses, insurance costs less dollar. probably $1000 dead. seriously chances slim good ventilation especially risk group (65+ comorbidity). 4,400 new cases Texas Maybe look 10000000 papers publish fine instead 1 got away. Next New England journal medicine hear good things lancet. Fact lancet around since 1823. Safe. Smart. Step-by-step.

Doubtful ,,l,,(-_-),,l., ""It's you, me"" ,,l,,(-_-),,l., Yeah, Civil Protection fantastic job data. Really impressive. Meanwhile, U.S. federal government literally can't provide daily data every U.S. state relating cases, recoveries, hospitalizations, ICU beds, etc. we’d go Oklahoma! ,,l,,(-_-),,l., India backlog Can’t scan phone COVID app QR code enters us immediately national database?

Maybe much seen single infected person. Oklahoma seems like business usual. countries hot time year? cases, faster reopening right?  know problems are, systematic racism militarized police thats reason existence protecting property elite class, propagated political system bought paid corporate elites... oh hey forgot one smh 4,400 NEW CASES Rather asking forum could Google it. Try debunk + Covid19 + conspiracy theories + China. 

When ask question easily answered Google search, people tend get suspicious motives. terrible news big pharmaceutical. biggest medical emergency 100 years effective treatment de patented drug costs $2. ,,l,,(-_-),,l., It’s even wave. It’s continuous flow infection rates directly correspond whether population follows distancing masks precautions. It’s gonna keep climbing reaches ghoulish untolerable level admit mounting fatalities need addressed. Well case, best healthcare business world still. Less!

104 million 30%, 40% Americans Obese. ,,l,,(-_-),,l., pulled wife healthcare industry would treating covid patients. family isn’t going die “freedumbs”. China title? It’s clear manufacturing consent taking place misleading headline, /u/OnEarth2000 pointed out.

If fact US industry representatives put profits people, shouldn’t main focus instead China? Racist Canada Juat counter increased testing isnt causing hospitalizations deaths ask would cause that? That's Arizona like numbers ,,l,,(-_-),,l., gross many people don’t wear masks. sister went pick ice cream, neither girls behind counter wearing masks none customers were. girls coming contact customers mask free, breathing food. left. Deep cleaning lot measures compliance theater. yes Fear. Sure, compare apocalypse everyone US dies, seem bad. that's never happened, I'm sure contrasting whole population dying. future humanity insignificant event. like Spanish Flu, World Wars etc bad time make much dent human population.

However events killed lot people, ranks one biggest last hundred years. us living this, pretty fucked. Every death tragedy.

9 million die per year starvation u ever leave go store something? we're screwed we're back ""not bad"" status quo. Nothing change. media succeeded job again. group friends game nights month. Getting four proven difficult, that's week's notice. American living northern border state, might best interests keep border closed. Jus' sayn' count shutdown begun  Everyone 2 months quarantine would gone.

Stupid people want though. Well stupid makes sense ofcourse. Better let pharma bro Martin Skreli get mitts it! Worry. Whatever situation, clearly reopening needed... biggest danger underestimate foe. shrewd. reason declared bankruptcy did. would pay system says to? think ever forthright assets. Keepin em gusssing. even amercians starts saying this, must really really f\*cked situation LOL. Covid 19: Coming soon theater near LA NYC! french ones dying smell Nearly safe? Except Lombardy, Italy safe safest parts Europe. Many regions reporting zero new cases zero new deaths.  mean, obvious anyone using common sense.

Back April thought sure bars, gyms movie theaters going reopen year impossible prevent spread there. would've never imagined would open across country month half later.  can't. RNC coming. can't roll anything back without angering boss. believe unicorns   Worse. Record new cases, ICU beds full almost...deaths follow Wait..what? KN95 mask probably best available public. don’t think good N95, definitely better cloth disposable mask opinion. It’s bad politics hedge little here, plain stupid part. Hope likes 1 term.  I'm you: Mookie (appropriately named) giving responsible free pass. 8 10 simplified 4 5 That's right, beach really anywhere outdoors, especially distancing masks, present little, any, chance infection. Holding indoors really stupid. weather get nicer now. Snow birds typically leave winter though summer US.

As trusting census, idk else supposed use. seems silly say ""nah census bogus, better trust eyeballing grocery store. Tons olds there. there's retirement community nearby. population definitely older New York.""

Idk say hospital beds. that's true that's concern well. unsolvable one. Hopefully isn't. is, hopefully they're preparing increases capacity. compared covid heart disease. thought point pretty straight forward. 3 yr old loves mask...as bonus keeps touching face touching everything else outside. Dude, clip bullshit mean asked pushed would it. like Biden spending entire 90's campaigning crime bills &amp; lying it.

You'll paranoid take guy. Trying find fault *when really isn't*. FYI, currently enter Canada quarantine two weeks. also present evidence shows food provided/delivered you, allowed break quarantine even go grocery store. unable this, turn away border.

Edit: exception provide evidence Canada take connecting flight/boat country. reason know buddy Hawaii sailing Alaska via Canada (flew Canada sailed Alaska). mention, almost policy aside, genuinely well intending actually brilliant leader who’s bot wildly touch? Yes please. That’s kinda we’re supposed see presidents relatively short terms think. Prevents one old sack farts rotting capital forever. Unfortunately obnoxious obese people too. kinda funny, guys trying keep people crossing southern border, we’re same.  big tech companies data info go!!


*sent iPhone* deaths UK always lower weekend? actually minorities treated worse hospitals often pushed jobs tend public facing likely exposed Covid.

In US, example highlighted often high maternal death rate among black mothers- found doctors less likely take complaints serious, unfortunately shortens window necessary care complications occur.

I fully believe ignore possible biological reasons, can't ignore societal reasons, either. problems. username checks full shit. someone could home would. want rent can't afford own. very, niche circumstance plans support renting. certainly endgame. benefit throwing 1-2k trash every month. blissfully ignorant? 

Oh right, slum lord exploiting housing shortage personal gain. doctors healthcare workers problem, they're capable anywhere else. 

Some cultural, state heavily aligns right-of-center, somehow taking infection-control measures become political issue. complacency, never really hit hard beginning first wave infections wreaking havoc elsewhere country, effects feel real people even lockdown measures may cost job lost income. fundamental lack capable leadership local state political figures get people board part fighting spread disease. 

When even pro-mask PSA Nick Saban managed get people board wearing them, knew heading bad direction here. disagree. need logarithmic chart go another tick two show scary numbers. linear chart can't even see pattern curve. big tech companies allowing WFH (Google, Facebook...). 

I think Zuck said WFH rest year, permanently.

In small construction company work for, we're \*all\* WFH. maintain decent productivity, open back up? Hey man, thanks well thought response. background medicine either, everything comes news sources.

I understand antagonism, aside ""I like them"". UK, longest voice lockdown Peter Hitchens - day one, set found agreeing him. Even idea ""anonymity muzzles"" (his words). argument think similar gloves - people use right, think work actually work (I skeptical standard cloth masks working might hope, due lack data it, rather research data). Hell, masks could act sort artificial herd immunity get actual treatments vaccines.

The arguments think justify wearing masks (except general health issues could impede life discussed GP) a) seriousness disease warrant drastic change. Or, b) concession anything return normality sets precedent changes may brought guise safety everyone else.

To clarify, actually agree points, neither sufficient enough go wearing masks, especially crowded. Now, wear time seems stupid going shopping, social activity strangers, work, happily wear mask also go life normal without fear catching disease. Oh dear. Well... try reminding virus rights freedoms? threatening firearms? try yelling Fox News rhetoric it? Maybe weren’t ignoring hard enough? Wasn’t “denying science like Trump” keeping safe time?

No? Oh shit, that’s right: pandemic doesn’t care politics religion. Time get program, dummies. think ask nicely, dad give million dollar loan. still listening WHO, literally flip flopped everything said including H2H, face masks, Hydrocloriquine, Asymptomatic Transmission, Airborne Transmission, Flight Restrictions, etc It’s good think loud. sounds like sensible plan there.  Holy shit, would commute 2 hours day pay that.  There’s literally video proof:  Right. true jobs? (Easier apply?) Obama, Hillary's emails, Benghazi, take responsibility Yeah. point people keep screaming density that’s whole truth since people move about. infected somewhere else bring live.  Good rents damn high!  I’ve got list places phone, I’m set. benefits run July anyways... 

Took fuckers 50 days get unemployment benefits kick in, called 75 times day (no lie).

On day 20 someone call unemployment: benefits, called tell jobs available... April 15th amid lockdown order.

Texas fucked beyond belief bottom 75%

Looking bottom, they're same. know unpopular opinion, I'm one thinks way. living neckbeard brother last November. late 30's early 40's. left despite financial support, worth live someone saw Help (I sister, think that's why) whose personal hygiene dietary habits caused need evacuate house couple occasions (dude's bedroom door browngrey around handle area bc wash hands, refused ever use bathroom fan, like shit stink).

So, familial support great, great mutual. rather happy isolated prior COVID. reason cheap. say ""whipper snapper""? looks like whipper snapper guy. observed travelling funeral. Covid death less.

I add BNA, DEN, &amp; SAT eerily empty restaurants closed gates unused...BWI still seemed light side normal. finding place eat breakfast DEN like scene zombie movie. Americans think falls wins war case revolutions rebellions. would assume American revolution successfully crushed Great Britain dead would considered British dead. LOL....top 25% everyone making 70K. think hit ""rich"" territory get top 5%, even low end group really perceived rich. it’s “facts” think they’re going implant tracking devices them? you’re refusing participate life-saving work believe that, fuck you. Top 25% isnt rich. 

The top 0.5% entirely different planet someone even 95th percentile. Good thing aerosols really common form transmission SARS-COV-2. Yes, believe obviously sarcastic point. He's saying, duh tests = 0 cases = 0. I'm highly contesting point people take 100% literally actually stopping tests. fact done tests country I'm mistaken. Swedish numbers match excess deaths pretty closely. $100 year? would mean property appraised annually, doubt average city would ever that. I'm really sure point is. 80% 100% dealing mass numbers protests, that's still covid spread. 

I see people wearing masks around chins. need expert going every protest say that. 

And idea point rideshares. really hope youre trying say well I've done covid, proves spread covid. could lingering symptoms people virus saying have. Interesting, mean rent income fall within window? act like would it. *against* really progressive policy. attack would make dude ""teamplayer"" imaginary 72. lose?

omfg, can't even people  similar statement president reminded bad dad joke:

""How improve employee morale? *Fire unhappy employees!*""

Same energy. Exactly! what’s gonna cause second wave ,perhaps even Third. I’ve never stressed fearful life now. course will, fuckload competition better developers areas. Yes. what’s terrifying. saw video online today one favorite yoga teachers teaching full class outside. caption read “all classes booked week” - indoor classes. Wtf. would risk long-term lung damage attend in-person yoga class!? That’s amazing. Great recovery hy NY wait, is... quote? honestly know anymore We're gonna hit 1-2million total, we? human beings talking about. respect. says treatment? I’m sure treatment improve it’s like “cure”. can’t lockdown every year would destroy society. would live risk, flu many illnesses. sub nothing clickbait misleading sky falling headlines. Come guys still??? 4 weeks enough time, seems, even clear direction adherence rules. 12 weeks restrictions Nova Scotia we've hit first full week zero new cases. hardest hit nursing homes completely clean bills health zero deficiencies found multiple Department Health inspections. virus fucking evil.

 salaries going away companies going remote. developers actually compete least whole country, good, they're accessible.  live valley 40 minutes Stockton. typed way mobile assed type whole thing fight autocorrect lol. Would normally type NorCal short. use NorCal autocorrect likes autocorrect can't assed fight it. Cali used mainly online short. person always say Northern California. Yes. difference COVID COVID. recall saw charts it, know surprised. CDC guidance says count everyone dies COVID COVID death, even hit proverbial bus. know think hospitalizations would different think hospitals would testing everybody.

On dwell time, guess agree definition. context, I've heard people use describe amount time people spending hospital. Obviously increasing beds become available states learned dumb send people back congregate living facilities immediately recovery.

I'm obviously open convinced, I'm looking convinced one way another. look data, numbers US look similar UK France similarly situated non-Asian, non-island nations. (like Germany) seem done better (though 100% better means), others done worse. course, US federal system response handled states. guess states handled response better (Florida, example) stack well countries like Germany, done poorly (New York New Jersey, example) near worst world. Regardless, see point waving arms screaming ""in midst real public-health crisis"". know Arizona trying hard enter competition. We'll see. Maybe endorsed UBI, would meant supporting another candidates policy even though best America Na little Yang Gang lol Good. Let r/Collapse. No. don’t asshole it. Jesus fucking sub.

Do know ""cumulative"" means? Market value = maximum amount rent current tenants willing pay moving out, minus landlord's cost finding equal replacement tenant rate. Lol get hopes they'll figure fill glut market things return normal. know done tests since then...in boroughs. Anyone get free antibody test here.

Based post history, comments shocking hyperboles assume dont really care facts anyway. [UK rents 3.5% – inflation rate could London rents increased 2.1%, though Wales North West saw biggest increases, 9.7% 8.3% respectively. data clearly show peak daily deaths steady downward trajectory despite similar drop new cases. 

Yes, peak occurred right around time Anders Tegnell said ""plateau"" reached. Two weeks later saw week question actually highest number deaths far. belief Swedish government began fiddling figures. Since lag increasing.

It took average 9 days report 90% deaths Mid-April. taking average 11 days. fact, recent report adding totals far back 28 days ago. suspect we'll see many reports days month ago increase, wiping supposed drop number Hospitalizations 

As said, number tells nothing risk group routinely denied hospital treatment intensive care treatment. seems elderly sacrificed keep ICU numbers low. Given transportation costs less (no car) probably cheap food/entertainment options, getting better deal, assuming frugal. NYC great place either frugal overspend, mostly depends habits. Mathematically, paying less rent/income, cars expensive, necessary Texas [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/yBpXy) part dangerous elderly, still sporadic cases young healthy people getting sick dying. hear they're outliers. flu thing, kinda like flu steroids. giving nasty look courtesy protecting willfully endangers life.

This situation worse-case scenario culture wars. visible act protects **others** labeled weak wrong. people wear masks protect ones refuse wear masks, ones refuse wear masks put mask wearers risk.

What's next, washing hands, covering mouth sneeze betas that, driving sober weak people can't handle booze. 

They wear stupidity like twisted point pride. I'm brave I'm willing allow protect health put jeopardy. That's bravery, that's villainy. asthma well ,which fear health fucking sucks people thing pandemic ,yet infection rates keep going feel lot people irresponsible regardless see happening. feel like everyone gonna get point that’s I’m terrified , cause don’t know body strong enough survive . educational credentials global warming? Instead dismissively retorting, let us know expertise subject. That's point made, enlighten me. want self-aware learning going solve issue. person cover Time dude. instead everyone goes emotion mob thinking. snobbish attitudes nothing feigned vapid outrage, victim-hood whining. Man fucking hate BART. use get work year so. wanted die sleep wake get train. avoid job would require use BART. 8 Months

People thought over-reacting back late Feb pulled kids school, saw writing wall. We're likely face second wave due seasonal factors, worse 2019-2020 COVID gone endemic US due governmental mismanagement. people shall nothing *eat*, **they eat rich** - Jean-Jacques Rousseau Holy shit. either deep denial predictive ability financial epidemiologic models, understand even tiniest details certainty, accuracy vs. consistency, etc...

Friedrich Hayek would certainly like word economics well. would non-egomaniac economists. Free make choices, dumbass decide go bars mid pandemic maybe?

Really? wrong you? Arizona locked IMO.
They'll make finish line weeks spare ahead states. E? Month month means raise rent 30-60 days notice. protect rent increases. NBA taking Disney world. don’t think want neighbors daughter either hard 13 day old Russian account shit poster. 6/4  Andrew Yang crazy pandemic hit /s Canada borders closed US reason. username checks out.

I wish less people would spout “knowledge” thing  small towns seem hotspots virus they're still holding large events get away it. food processing plant prison. Psychopathy trait evolved too. Really interesting theories especially fit 'altruism' apes. Oh, know that... need confront spread disinformation. one? Well say something massive protests without masks ignoring social distance. reminds stupid bitches made video going target care pandemic. Ok, actions letting spike grow hurting hospital system. one reading this?!? feel like I’m taking crazy pills 

Way backfire right face DeSantis. Keep opening 0 regard human life watch happens. responsible Governor would gauge take control things, dude literally going full steam ahead Titanic’s iceberg Good know everyone's response demands sources going forward. too, bro.  Impatience greatest weakness. want over.  hope gets posted million times.... ""We're Gonna Keep Trucking!

We'll wait see. also, cargo. Better make reasonable price let everyone afford it. people made joke expense, literally point laugh me, get hostile wearing mask 65. shove governor. much blame anyone young person I've met. think 100,000+ deaths couple months even though entire country world lockdown comparable flu season?? understand people thought comparable flu January even February still feel way, wonder really amount us deaths actually would change mind? anyone care you’re worried for? could understand data think Covid-19 serious does.

That's problem.

Those hysterical Covid ignoring science data.  people unable figure basics targets scapegoating destruction translate respect context? feeling? weird, non-linear course relapse remission. 3 month mark took pretty severe turn worse energy sit feed thanks steroids.

There signs infection body, inflammation keeps getting worse.

Doctors stumped. Acting like bar gave virus HOARDS humans going building. Meanwhile Americans trying circumvent ban lying Canadian border patrols way Alaska. nation claims heavily strict international border security, sure bunch hypocrites. similar situation MONTRÉAL month ago today 100 cases dropping quickly. I’m lucky live place people respecting other’s safety. It’s late Texas wake save lives! Comrade covid can’t serious.

Meanwhile I'm like, ""if simply heretofore lived crippling depression social anxiety perfectly fine right now. Just, jesus, smoke fucking weed watch last season Killing Eve. really hard."" Nothing see here. /s  read last paragraph reply? didn’t say US healthcare good spot. it’s broken extreme like it’s touted website. Yes, “certain” brand epipen, even though majority people need epipens afford perfectly fine. Blind cynicism isn’t justified one aspect outrageous argument actually true.

Shit expensive it’s also lot affordable whole hell lot flexible reddit wants believe. Tell me, health system supposedly doesn’t care people would leave die, mom able talk hospital (notoriously one difficult negotiate billing with) waiving $2,000 bill nurse staff rude her? two months ago.

US Healtcare fucked, it’s fucked way through. Y’all wanna criticize it? Go it, look little articles extreme cases.

I actually agree part US healthcare system driven greed. said, I’ll fight blind cynicism see there’s way much world it’s killing society. dumb comparison, multiple reasons.

1. WWI killed many young people drafted war. COVID-19 mainly killed seniors.

2. Spanish Flu, direct aftermath WWI, real killer.

3. far less people back today. Link dominos roast please 🙏 right, twice! think things bad america america bunch really bad indicators, must *want* bad. Mark this..... ok stay overdramatic lol, I'll enjoy live social distancing definitely wear masks Trump rally known spread COVID-19, riots protests apparently though. yeah, still dishonest report pneumonia death, death would occurred without covid19. Covid19 causes pneumonia many people yes. Even still, flare back heartbeat NY people walk around careless mentalities like it’s over. we’re seeing rise cases states acting  Clearly fuckton astroturfing. Chinese? Russian?

Don't manipulated opinions reddit. Look data yourself. sure downvoted. honestly know states past first wave fall. Arizona Alabama clearly hit hard wave 1 now, states way large peaks. talk fall second wave reflect we're seeing now. (Unless we're referring wave 2 northeast past wave 1.) 

My state yet peaked wave 1, cases growing every day. people act like we're long past wave 1. I'm tryin man. Thanks lot 

This website using watch distance USA finally falls victim natural selection. Money military funding cant save guys shit. coronavirus doesnt oil guys steal likely ignored together. bad possible basically make wine water something sugary. No, wrong. job newspapers make information digestible you. however article you. interested fluid dynamics. detailed, that's whole point. Maybe want take responsibility, blame someone else--the officials. Meh, atheist US I’m pretty used now. Fight back respectfully evidence. I’m situation work started bringing travelers Kaiden’s spreadsheets. Hell I’m meeting person. That’s perfectly fitting online meeting. However 1 person agreed. case, CDC OSHA guidelines aren’t friend. *American politicians.

Things still pretty tight side pond. Things better measures still place. state zero deaths last week, seen without mask store closed space people youll fine 600 euros. know shit serious. Wait, 140k top 116k confirmed? maybe almost one dallas wearing masks social distancing all. throwing shade China countries stopped testing testing little suddenly problem

I think exaggerating little countries testing make people believe US isnt one worst performing countries handling pandemic.

Obviously thats different criticism entirely saya pretty dumb even context. different reasons. Might get shot though. English translation Google:

One half days start, new Corona warning app already installed millions times. Praise also came consumer advice center - virologist, hand, believes app cannot function optimally current data protection.

According Federal Ministry Health, almost 6.5 million users downloaded new Corona warning app Wednesday morning. ""There well six million reasons corona virus fewer chances future,"" said Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) Berlin. Every single person uses app makes difference: ""Curbing Corona team game.""

The app started Tuesday night. downloaded Apple Android smartphones intended make easier track possible infection chains corona pandemic.

The app also received praise World Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery: ""I loaded app convinced important component fight pandemic,"" told ""Passauer Neue Presse"" Wednesday. ""If vast majority population downloads app follows recommendations, assume help.""

Whether app ultimately works depends used, said Montgomery. ""That show future.""

Fundamental praise also came board directors Federation German Consumer Organizations (vzbv), Klaus Müller. scale one ten, ten best rating, gave app eight, said Müller Wednesday ZDF “Morgenmagazin”.

Müller reported vzbv received critical feedback fact app work cell phones older operating systems. Questions data protection would also asked frequently.

Saskia Esken, leader SPD, initially expressed concerns possible data protection problems. meantime, changed mind: ""Now app available download reasonable reason install it,"" told Wednesday's ""Augsburger Allgemeine"". already Tuesday morning.

Virologist Alexander Kekulé warned possible false alarms app. said podcast MDR Tuesday smartphone, example, could recognize protective plexiglass panes whether contact persons worn face mask.

In addition, technology register people met, whether outside confined space, Kekulé pointed out. app could identify ""important dangerous contacts"". Actually, system work properly, ""if also information room"", planned data protection reasons. people protesting... ONE teen infected ? talking singing aerosolize virus, cardio equipment awesome spin classes.

If worked gym (I home gym thankfully), going right now... talking singing aerosolize virus, cardio equipment awesome spin classes.

If worked gym (I home gym thankfully), going right now... Plus undoubtedly work home Gym.

I wonder better $250 pandemic gym. Oh...forgot $500 Walmart spin bike. Yes medical community decided conference call deliberately lie everyone destroy trust himself. That’s protocols elders Zion type bullshit secretly decided fates millions people. Fuck them. Thank you! I've saying day 1. one forget lies, led mistrust. Additionally, discussion science evolve get data instead one set leaders saying protest away safe important (increasing spread not) leaders feeling act like away positive thoughts crap. think whole situation lesson important look behind headline meme

1. DOCS: wear masks

2. YOU: Why?

3. DOCS: people touch face, properly fit masks, wash hands after

4. YOU: I'm good that? face coverings?

The people blaming people saw 1 progress 3 more. Yes doctors important made personal choices everyone saw images Chinese wearing masks coming Wuhan. 100k dead people conscience doctors lot people died obvious questions whether wear mask not. also knowing asymptomatic spread. like blaming doctor telling eat healthy exercise... goes far. Good old British spreading disease usual. agree, stupids gathering thousand streets. sub least 90% liberal, feel certain protesting okay types protesting not. even news? Like mozzarella stick? Oh quit ‘we r fucked’. u aren’t vulnerable category grow balls. 18% really bad think stay there, Arizona SC 18% days ago lower since, trends see pretty obvious China's actual death toll 5 billion now. /s I’ve experiencing fair bit gastrointestinal issues week now. don’t think diet changed much, usually eat pretty decently. think unrelated, something continue monitor? Lol cancelled anyway, going Florida. second positive test negative result may mean virus simply taking time leaving body, doctors said, longer able infect others.

""It's possible people could shed remnants virus period time. mean anything wrong contagious,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease expert Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville. good massless peopmeare obviously stupid let em perish society better long run ""bad enough"" people, think. severity increases denial decreases love Banff, would greatly appreciate fellow countrymen would go Canada goober up. He's 72!?! Jeez.... wow. Watching him, assumed 50s, though known better. doesn’t, perhaps? government allocating infection tracking billion, says Finance Minister Per Bolund (MP). Money obstacle infection detection. government estimates total 6.9 billion testing. Five billion go antibody avsätter nu en smittspårningsmiljard, säger finansmarknadsminister Per Bolund (MP). Pengar inte ska vara ett hinder för smittspårning. Regeringen anslår totalt 6,9 miljarder för testning. Fem miljarder ska gå till antikroppstestning.

Seems nationwide. think remotely logical switch antibody testing PCR burden infection high. Antibody testing uses, much TTI scenario, international European standard is. Antibody applicable herd immunity / immunity passport scenario. worth mention Stockholm Swedens worst hit region tested persons randomly selected. 

They pay 750 SEK (about US$75) get test. 
Of course means mostly persons sick interested test.

14% incredibly low. Dear everyone gave shit buying full face P100 gear February using last three months around people - suck lol..  Let em die, need them. Almost everything nowadays done ""properly live"" indoors. need go entertain long read anything, play video games, internet connection whatever... even TV cable (even there's barely anything worth watching nowadays. jobs done home even food delivered case feel like going sometimes. Social media pretty much phone allows keep contact family friends too. 

If want enjoy shortlived 2 weeks ""true life"" awful death careful enough, fuck them... Didnt Greg Abbott take seriously beginning, fuckin hypocritic thought Obama Soros conspiracy lol Uhh, think we're going back quarantine 2020. would require governors admit wrong, lack ability. thought protested granted immunity. There's plenty Vitamin certain fish mushrooms. make priority, done without much trouble. Yeah, find good news, sub doesn’t like good news though lol. people even wearing masks they're told to. ain’t scared another clickbait article. fact paying $6000 considered good though...  Ironically nurses family also say it’s overblown time reopen country. smart bot. passing exam 51% really good enough. 49% voters voted him. He's taking responsability task force responsible deal covid, whole medical community. Hmm news article, looking forward seeing scientific takes now! speculation ""one strain infectious other"" since March, found one strain common other. date evidence virus gotten functionally different all, coronaviruses always slow mutate. information see That's problem. serious enough need something it, serious enough get people anything it.  adequate another lie. full seal masks keep virus spreading, even 95%. It’s caused much confusion death. lying along. think plan actually herd immunity. Bad plan. Dumb. Lol comment get removed, one mine does? Like, I've problem removing political comments, least keep bias it, mods. Yikes. Good question. wonder too.

The crazy thing recommending homemade masks helps slow spread, slowing spread helps protect healthcare workers....
This really issue protecting *only one* (general public vs healthcare workers). They're dead, they're resting. people positions help guide Florida people put room scientists engineers, would still assume they're smartest person room. knew get go stop lying announced pandemic America would never able lock long enough well enough mitigate it. gave know many people wack jobs follow along. Well there’s 2 reasons would, even say Oxfords works gets approved.

1. decided studies vaccine. Alright, theory, sounds great. bad however want study, don’t start study August, Oxford reporting data back Uk weeks even start fucking trials, um, clearly wouldn’t enough data.

2. Even get data back, it’s FDA data promptly go sit FDA bureaucrats desk 2 weeks anyone actually starts send review anything FDA understand concept efficiency.

We still shot, really Oxfords vaccine hopes around 2020 I’ve heard blamed migrant farmworkers now. know you, hope catch it.

...I would say want catch it, might wisen up, almost ensures would get too.. hopefully buddies catch without passing - maybe work. say PROTESTERS TLDR: dick ""But guess comes kind world want live in, diversity disagreement, disagreement treason, well don’t surprised find reaping strange bitter fruit sad old man beside keeps feeding young minds virtue. 

It takes village raise child flag raze children they’re nothing ballast fulfilling madman’s dream paradise complexity reduced black white. protect cult death?""

Dear Coach's Corner - Propaghandi 927 official deaths today.  successful^^^if rich .... Funny, homemade masks bandanas t-shirts considered adequate, yet adequate April?!

Lying option here.

Not that, objective protect healthcare workers, slowing spread general public wear masks helps exact objective! yet, need ICU bed someone else it, screwed... Let riots continue. lol second wave. first one still over. It’s almost like swedes considerate Americans. Following government guidelines masks socially distancing instead screaming “freedom” infecting others. Stop blaming young people, selfless literally given months lives older people stay alive. Would tough do. would average joe buying 1k masks reselling street. healthcare staff needed protected costs, even lie. Masks mandatory too, towns say fuck all.

They also running barber shops bars despite banned (though former lift.) would’ve people immediately going buying precious masks. Americans selfish, look happened toilet paper hoarding scalping. 

If chief executive wasn’t willing invoke defense production act control supply direct needed masks medical wearers, American public would’ve simply hoarded every single one Fauci knew that. No, don't. Americans routinely worry cancer diagnosis end future financial stability. problem insurance companies pay politicians, tell people system turn us Cold War-era Soviet Union. local dump mountain bike trail it. Dyer Park. ""This political stance"" 

&amp;#x200B;

..... Masks political ffs... UK you?

In North-East pretty much everywhere I've everyone wearing mask ones wearing one getting dodgy looks. credibility. Thanks. knew everyone needed masks virus hurt young people kids Fauci straight lied everyone. Surgeon General lied everyone. Governors CDC lied everyone. hundred thousand people died, many end year.

Tell Chinese government bad. makes think forbidden watch things here? liability insurance guys get sick? ask policy there. varies much area. (NW New Jersey, 90%+ compliance masks. shore....maybe 30-40%. agree desired effect, telling us truth enforcing restrictions purchasing? think lot places see US one whole entity true way it’s big country states unique way handling really doesn’t make sense lump together. Different parts country different trajectories thing. Tell non-waterproof laptop &amp; laptop bag FUCK!!! Blinding necessary could subjective biases symptom description/severity reporting.

Given outcome measurement study objective gets (death survival), neither doctors patients incentive skew outcomes (i.e. kill patients one arm trial), blinding pointless measure would slow study. can't think setup friendlier superspreading, shoulder-to-shoulder Redhats screaming bare-faced hours, indoors. argument there! Trouble drinking water one hand? Lol. true....I’m sure put 10lbs county fair one year... So. Much. Cheese. allow intimidated Bully. sacrifice integrity keep job. would rather door dash clean toilets, maybe hands shaking fear losing job, put mask Dumb question, government worried individuals flocking stores bulk-buying masks, couldn’t feds state governors seized masks via eminent domain (or similar theory)? Way help morons. You’re great job. Seriously. supposed trust anything say now? Scientists one people looked relied truth, gives credence conspiracy theorists

And went far lie, basically mocking masks “MAYBE could stop one tiny particle” it’s weird don’t agree all. I’m disappointed frankly little embarrassed defended staunchly idiots sycophants. Unless youre one cardio gods wear mask purposefully restrict air flow. people scare Thanks apology honesty l think there's much point continuing - we're clearly coming issue different angles. think COVID19 least serious Spanish Flu goes far beyond IFR, ethical issues treat elderly, exposure poverty (particularly black ethnic minorities), politicization science driven. changing change society ways can't even dream yet. us first half... Imagine people ignore warnings still travel Florida regardless. spread country we're back March. Steroid use cause liver, kidney, heart problems- things attacked covid?

Are trying tell us former professional bodybuilder Arnold might used steroids life!? Well never...! slow it. slowly stockpiling supplies suddenly announcement made EVERYONE stockpiled everything. next time happens way worse everyone trying outpace everyone else's panic buying even harder. Depending governments could announce resumption original lockdown procedures day now. sweet, honour healthworkers too? ones he's cutting wages? they're stupid. Next question. Wow, crybaby.

Asking someone wear mask tyranny?

You sad joke. Live Scotland too, umbrellas useless either windy, smirry rain that's fine soaks instantly without realising heavy soaks feet believe every person sudden follow execute rules. Okay. let ask question: people still murdered world? prohibited law it? can't murder anymore. sound logic you? r/noshitsherlock 
Only partially kidding. Yes, hope stays way - @ 3 week mark people seek medical attention. still people testing positive hundreds daily - hospitalized. several “lets go back office people”. either hate staying home families miss 3 hours coffee talking cafe. nothing work. Sorry, mean phrase comment question. Rephrasing; Harvard fire several tenured professors chinese communist party's payroll, fired facing academic espionage charges. Hey I’m protesting. I’m going airplanes

But still analyze data front conclude protests aren’t causing spike cases people stupid clearly value toilet paer things... food liqour even . Nah, 140k number expected amount deaths, impact COVID death rate cos that's new thing compared previous years.

It acount changes mortality diseases (caused people seeking healthcare, even drop influenza mortality) completely accurate number say many people died COVID, shows impact COVID death rate compared years. absolutely would have, hand sanitizer already sold Fauci made announcement. terms short term yes, treatment going make immune contracting coronavirus would suprised lasted system long run since anti bodies would chilling system rather body producing help killer/helper cells important long term immunity. However, would stop virus actually spreading lungs, symptoms come danger is, effective broadly administered make mortality rate plummet greatly improve three things A) standard care B) lowering time spent hospital C) preventing critical complications covid pry up, ain't exactly nailed then, it? Gold’s Gym Venice, aka Mecca, cultural relevance weightlifting community Arnold personally. Recommend look Pumping Iron Generation Iron Wyoming underrated state. Love place think FHM wants publish new result antibody studies tomorrow, sampled randomly. probably signed several dozen time pandemic ends.

and legal side, think it'll incredibly challenging, even without waiver, recover business contracted COVID check Paper Lysol people earlier hoarding.

Maybe wrong them, see coming from. bias opposite direction, wherein people paranoid (and practice much stricter social distancing) likely want tested especially pay it. That's random sampling important, biases like (and people making assumptions causality) unscientific. thing hospital beds available mean fill up. know stopping economy devastating mandate wearing mask? compromise? NY work force reduction March 20. firm imposed end February (Calofornia headquarters). technically correct. Workforce still returned - unless construction essential worker. Yes go essentials exercise - nothing open little people still go out. Americans brave. I'm really glad took time elaborate point here. never thought manner.

That makes whole thing crazier I've spent lot time Reddit reading news past several months. I've noticed headlines either becoming sensationalist headlines. Either always never noticed before.

Without opposing opinions would see I'm out, definitely made worldview really narrow COVID, riots, everything else. like overconsumption media making way directly brain become think ideas. come talking USA, Brazil Sweden article beijing? Sounds like missed point completely. got sick Puerto Rico, that's gave me. great news. would say popular everywhere reason show body 6months year. yeah, well plenty areas pushed open fine. explain Texas, highest number cases ever? think flu, go get it. It’s ok. obvious intent first announcements made. 

**Public health isn’t individual medicine.** made decision needed done *safety populace* supplies available early March.  meant “protect doctors” - without die later. It’s necessarily best call every individual equation. It’s trolley problem real life. enough reports phenomenon truly raise flag. don’t know happening yet. Chronic infection table, matter number hysteric deniers sub. Americans obsessed pretending something that’s ~obviously~ dangerous somehow perfectly safe? It’s many cases. Wait week see wrong. Women monogamous. could one super spreader. [بيسكي لاستاندات Deaths still 1100+ thing point. confusing look Trump's cabinet past. (hint, check Small Business Administration's former leaders) Hmmmm...

""If feel confused whether people wear masks kind, you’re alone. COVID-19 novel disease we’re learning new things every day. However, much confusion around masks stems conflation two different functions masks.

Masks worn *protect wearer* getting infected masks worn *protect others* infected wearer. Protecting wearer difficult: requires medical-grade respirator masks, proper fit, careful putting taking off. masks also worn prevent transmission others, important use going around medical grade mask ill close infected people smart? going around non-medical grade one thinking protected? see people office masks I'm assuming they're protect illness... going ""wow person stupid"". Sure, lot them. 

There interview resident first housing complex reported already 14 days ago many people living also regularly travelling another housing complex. city communicates 14 days later two women second housing complex tested positive !routine check!. connections known long time. 

Also numbers whitewashed, interview chief medic, saying test results take maximum 24h.

However city announced test results delay 4-5 days. Probably order get critical also interesting compare city's figures transmitted RKI, extreme reporting delay!

Numbers city: RKI: wrote RKI even amazed delay!

The test first housing complex also completed 500 people tested. least 700 them, many drug addicts half homeless. city even know lives there. 

In addition, infected people complex tested although wanted tested - simply sent away. confirmed city press conference. 

You'll find here: Yep, breadcrumb coating. popular MN there. New Zealand kinda lucky way, island able impose strict border controls. suspect every case like there's bound never found officials and/or never gets publicity, especially EU countries open borders. many countries also depend tourism keep borders shut vaccine accurate tests available (and even there's doubts effective vaccine is, suppose). Even Italy demanding 14-day quarantine anyone travelling there.  current administration contributed shortage confiscating PPE states Trump's buddies could sell more. Hospitals hide PPE feds. action negatively affected even devoted followers? Yes. Even women. Thank you! hope stay well crazy place call home. already happening. ""witches"" 5G towers. You’re assuming perfect knowledge. didn’t exist. 

But hey, blame others. distract reality. Well let ask question: many Chinese media consume every year? It’s rough year. Life rough. remain apart next year family still here. want see happens people think personal feelings privileges far important safety everyone else, government coddles people, look USA. Please don’t follow example. Ban Americans please least, sake. suspect similar harassment Dr. Acton Ohio stepped down. “official” statement doesn’t really say much why, also constantly harassed lunatics. sub officially denounces protests, then? I'll never understand say wear cloth mask bandana.... Everyone something house could used mask..... without needing n95s medical grade masks. think would hard understand, Americans we're talking Best wishes good luck surgery! report true yes, antibodies obtained recovered patients able prevent infection and/or treat infected people.

Doesn’t say done animal studies, assume done vitro (ie within sterile lab equipment), treated virus exposed human cells observed infection.

There may different conditions vitro Vivo (ie within living things), also major differences individual human cells whole human body. don’t get excited, chance treatment doesn’t work real life.

That said, underlying principle 5 antibodies work similar, identified major weakness virus develop better treatments. Would interesting see data. get trying do, backfired. tell us that’s why, don’t work.

Also, flip flop, CDC WHO, know creates distrust, “do really idea doing” matter.

Atleast CDC however legitimate reason point, WHOs stance could legitimately thought nothing, given track record recently never happen America. Part feels like doomed country. hate pessimistic, government can't come together work together stop deadly virus, trouble. government could worked together ""sell"" solution public, didn't. mention island, photos I'm guessing Phi Phi Island. way could've told people masks work resulted hoarding. lie probably single biggest factor allowing healthcare workers PPE. good move recognize greed stupidity Americans act that. Imagine headline that's case: 

**CCP members got first dose covid19 vaccines, leaving general public sick vulnerable!**

Cue Redditors ""China human rights Tibet Xinjiang Beijing Falungong 1989 Tiananmen blah blah""

Damned do, damned don't. Agreed. wife call Immortals, around here, everywhere. went hiking State park yesterday (I’m PA resident). shops open (I didn’t go in, looking parking). taken picture throngs people packed cue masks, you’d horrified. certainly was. chose trails less popular, smart part, didn’t see soul actual hike. 

My point is; I’m trend short lived. Imagine that. Someone actually takes responsibility things. Imagine President that? less 100 active cases within 4,000km are.

Don't worry. people wearing masks, last long. sounds like poorly written comeback lame high school bully. Yes, sorry, never sure post new reply mine edit previous one Reddit add information shortly after. denial reality reality involves situations like. 

""Just pretend apply us won't."" Trump supporting mom shared FB post said “we make masks say Trump 2020 see fast libs say don’t wear masks”

I commented post saying “you know feel Trump, got everyone wearing mask id 100% it” Love racist breakdown, want wear mask go it. force wear one. want sit home fear life, go it. force same. said protesting, looting thot problem federal government taken seriously beginning stocked PPE chance January February. Trump invoke DPA N95 masks April. American company offered start 4 idled production lines capable nearly 2M N95 masks per week federal contract, feds ignored him. Yeaaaah, probably best then. looking beaches, bad year. would like wide open spaces mountains, Wyoming Montana fairing pretty well. Uh electoral system US designed give power wealthy. 90% votes president nothing. Look electoral interstate compact. trying fix founding fathers mistakes. Yes period peak death curve. wonder clarity get amount currently sick/people antibodies Stockholm weeks, thanks open testing everyone, could potentially change results significantly. you’re getting downvoted telling truth this. I'm saying cloth masks filter air. Cloth masks protect catching virus, protect people catching virus cloth masks kind face covering matter lessen amount droplets entering air first place. many people worried this. Masks protect you, protect people you. need think helping people right now. need mentality spreading opposed catching it. countries mask cultures much better us US. Alot Americans wrong mentality comes this. going come near people, wear mask. kind face covering better face covering. Plain simple. Good points opinion bars restaurants riskier due masks eating drinking. Gyms much salons. thought they’re done virus.

They never thought virus done them. Yep, personal preferences definitely, FUCK normal people seem brain damage believe goddamned idiot? possible legitimate medical exemption wearing least form face covering?

Even people reduced lung function recommended wear mask catch they're fucked. hoax, according 4th grade teacher, became real protesters. They're idiots good explanation it’s side border? Norrbotten tested per capita Sweden 1412 tests per 100K week 23. 
Gällivare one hardest hit regions 310 per K. that’s 3,5 hr drive border, hardly commute distance. Also Kiruna 490 per 100K, 3 hrs drive. 
The municipalities along border less 15 cases don’t even 100K data. Including Haparanda neighboring Ylitornio, 29 cases. Kolari 18 cases Kittilä 27 cases. 718, 464 420 per 100K small populations. 

To seems like Finns want make news this. 

Sources FHM article.  science clear.  Wearing masks reduces transmission large percentage. Estimates 40 80 percent reduction. 

The R0 virus, Florida, currently 1.05 according .   

If masks reduce transmission rate even 10 percent, R0 1, virus die out. Well stronger then. inject muscle arm, painless that's nonsense. hurt. isy loading dose maybe 3 monthly ones different initial 6 injections upper arm arm swapped every week. fuck guys holding umbrella like lmfao



That’s literally problem unless you’re holding like soldier holding musket he’s marching. especially people don’t older umbrellas big handle big thing front, mainly ones flat top it’s usually smaller. woman 40. Young dumb? bring couple nips carry-on liquids bag. cheaper anyway. steroid hereditary. likely both. like everything else released 100% confirmation anything. says might things look promising need data Almost do? mask sufficient solution greatly reduces spread virus. Stop ignorant. multiple ways tackle issues; however, either illegal dangerous. 

1. Crime. solve gentrification bring crime. Crime general decreases property monumentally. 

2. Rioting proved something. Burning certain corporate properties decreases value area. 

3. Reducing populations. places begin increase population well rent goes lack supply. much gentrification population increase. Reducing population certain areas, counties whatever decrease demand. need spread urbanization around state reduce strain rent increases dense areas. 

Again, ways efficient passing legislation lets honest legislation always favor rich renters middle class. really get it, though.

So people moving high-priced apartments - makes sense. go somewhere. corresponding increase demand lower priced units suburbs? drive prices lower cost areas? People still need live somewhere.

I see flattening effect prices, really understand would drop overall. Oh yeah, hurricanes totally dumb shit worry about. cause thousands evacuations, millions dollars property damage already buckling economy, stress hospital systems outages injuries. all.

You sure sound like know stuff, case ought familiar fact hurricane season already started one could pop time. historically August September produce lot scariest storms.

Also, accounts people suffering several months recovering primary virus. virus going away then. don't.

But I'm UK, I'm exactly one talk either. would funny fucked. lot people commute Sacramento. Yeap... first wave ended us start second. imagine dumb recommend bars fully reopened pandemic? Yeah, terrible happened. comments idiotic sounding unsustainable cannot sustained. 

&amp;#x200B;

This model White house uses know... $3k/mo live gets luxury 3-4 bedroom home.

But salary $60-100k/year.

The thing Manhattan would cost $10,000/mo, salary would $100-200k/year.

So difference rent effectively around 1.5x more.

That premium I'd pay top cost living city much opportunity.

For example, live, I'm unlikely go far career get positions like CMO CCO many here. get let go quit, takes find new job there's 1-2 new openings every days.

Meanwhile, Manhattan, get DOZENS new openings every day inbox, well recruiters reaching me.

Ultimately prefer life live reasons rent, think people forget they're paying live expensive cities.

That’s choice. I’m gonna fault folks going eat, church. you. cherrypick. acknowledge adjusts past pretends he's always one opinion even though clearly hasn't. whole controversy around Sweden's strategy largely due previous statements herd immunity. sudden vaccine viable option herd immunity. first time even said anything results antibody study, he/they realised kind herd immunity hoping immunity main goal, slowing spread hospitals handle is.

A strategy they've built upon faulty core assumption virus impossible level herd immunity could reached (positive) consequence since vaccine far away.

It's positive 4968 people already died consequence low level immunity end vaccines necessary eradicate disease.

This was, long time, really opinion PHA. Herd immunity always talked sort substitute vaccine, even though vaccine would come handy risk groups. remember saying: Australians needs best virus Australian.

So drug takes patient 3% chance dying gives 2% chance dying instead saves 33% patients would otherwise die decreases death rate 1/3.

A drug takes vented patient covid 40% chance death gives 28% chance death instead saves 12/40=30% patients would otherwise died, equivalent cutting death rate 1/3.

Unfortunately folks focus extreme voices. Great, sounds like super plan. what? going two months. 2-3 days week bouts nausea lack better term chucking. goes away days week comes back. yeah.... Pretty unsafe honestly.  called strike, grocery workers that. Ah, CNN - credible, reliable, *certainly* never agenda. Sheesh like Joe Rogan guests tested interviews don’t wear masks goes president people around guys I'm one work. little dude lung issues, I'll take whatever advantage mask offer. He'll one ten days. virus indeed survive long period cold chain. Exactly dude, numbers prob much higher, government wont still test everyone  TBH really care all. long push said dicks face let desire. dick, problem. really Struggled seen mentality take place  experience, people claim wearing mask less healthy wearing mask right staunchly conservative it’s worth arguing anyway think making people wear masks betrays freedom. Oh no. UK, U.S. Brazil registering worst numbers pandemic, anybody else see pattern here? Remember focus ones closest 😊 stay strong God deleting idiots ruin planet like blosonaro voters. That’s upper middle class intelligent reason class know much BS coronavirus is. Come now! Fauci predicted pandemic back 2017? Bill Gates talking vaccination yet people America still ignorant believing what’s told gain it’s happening years seems like lot people don’t want wake still seem sleep. real serious pandemic NOTHING would open public. Come now! truth there. know look. America lied many many years easily manipulated brainwashed it’s crazy. Yes live yes learned think media tells me. find reputable sources information. Please take wake call trying put anything. That’s intention. America getting worse 2020 it’s sad going moment time. Americans finally realize handling pandemic TRUMP'S control.

There reason Faucci contact POTUS 2 weeks. Comparing East Asian strain much virulent strain (that probably mutated Italy) fool's errand based apples oranges, though. comparing USA inflicted strain.

And yes, still stacks poorly, degree. Even though Chinese still think virus control US. friends(from world) think chaos US seems wrong. I'm sorry deal say so^^ gene pool gonna get whole lot smaller. 35k new CONFIRMED cases. think they're going forest villages favelas check many people got infection translates wear mask give fuck upvote downvote. vote either lol.

Yeah OK mate. Force 47 asswipes Vietnamese Kommie Ministry Propaganda paid sit around nothing then, right? Whateva call robbery, called eminent domain. Every government it. Funny keep linking facebook page credential, ignoring interviews people Dong Tam shitting family violent. even piece land planned Mieu Mon development area. wanna stir get Viet Tan money.

Yeah OK. Let's pretend 800 media outlets Kommie Vietnam independent controlled Kommie Vietnam's corrupt regime, yes? Kommie Vietnam's bottom ranking Press Freedom Index, 175th 180 countries surveyed, exist, yes? asking people pretend widespread lands-robbing farmers-killing happen, either? still answer question. saying farmers terrorists, too, comrade?

Barbaric Vietnamese Kommie terrorists love running tractors victims robbing lands destroying homes Here's desperate Vietnamese citizens caskets ready die defending homes lands robbed lowlifes that's 1 hundreds thousands similar cases across Vietnam every year.

Use keywords 'cuop dat' (land robbery) 'cuong che' (forced confiscation) follow name location Vietnam. That's going show widespread land robbing practice Vietnam systematically implemented sub-human criminals, decades!

Small sample area-specific search previously   (here one 3/// lawyer talking legality Dong Tam)   play youtube facebook game day baby.

Again, 800 media outlets Kommie Vietnam state-controlled. Everyone knows Bolsa TV failed lawyer Kommie Vietnam's payroll. fool one, mate. fuck's sake, even put Kommie Vietnam's flag video Nice try deceiving people though, comrade!

For real, unbiased change. Take picks.

Here assessments independent also found funny defend Kinh, exact thing called: corrupted Kommie. embezzled money aimed Dong Tam development, using political connection power make ways whole family top chain Dong Tam. kicked government corrupted, suddenly became shining light democracy lmao. Honestly, government soft. countries, family would pumped full lead back 2019 kidnapped people soldiers. looking forward 29 convictions. hope get 29 death penalties.

See above. insist asking people ignore basic legal protocols (execution trials) civilized society pretend even videographic factual evidences exist, what's point forces much bigger 80K whatever numbers cited, since almost citizen Vietnam want Viet Tan die thousand deaths. government might problems, better terrorism 3/// come with.

Yeah ok, that's 10 million furious Vietnamese citizens protested corrupt ruling Vietnamese Kommies' trying sell Vietnam China personal gains (bribes) 2018 without approval largest protests record history Vietnam, ever, right comrade? LOL outdated info. women met someone way hugged kissed them, also attended gym class public. way rates increasing US, think border closed till mid 2021 least. includes people inbound flight doubt airport staff. Sure fine, force people get VISAs, let's improve process though people decades without one Good hear dude. town live 2 deaths, 20 confirmed cases 40k population far. 100% mask wearing same. situation NZ absolute cluster fuck. women apparently got 'lost' motorway Auckland. Called someone help hugged kissed. also attended gym class people. utterly selfish lying brats. Tell countries high populations effectively stopped spread virus trending towards 0. 

You're dipshit dude. pure dipshit. didn’t leave couldn’t wear mask, left don’t enforce everyone wearing masks. 
That isn’t say doesn’t care others, action based fact it’s safe anyone mask wearing optional. puts risk. know ton families moved NYC. want yard higher likelihood schools opening fall. think Norway somewhere around number too.

Swedens numbers lower hoped for, still significantly higher countries went lockdown (Naturally) Given suspicious surge ""non-COVID pneumonia"" deaths past months, US might already past 160k. Yeah, masks take reproductive rate 1, they're wholly efficient. testing contact tracing are. many sources claiming situation florida...

If follow 1 news source feeling mental disability... That's incredibly insightful way describe fuckery that's going US right now. Vaccine $0

Service fee $1000 many deaths talking here? keep mind .79 rate witholding 15 percent fatalities. British man.... 0 Cyprus, wait allow Brits travel here... job lied, there's something going system. filed unemployment, accepted, got first payment, tried certifying last Wednesday said eligible needs new claim first certify, able get call past week trying every day.

She get $600 extra either first week got it. getting confused trying read website see getting money not, getting told friends making ""too much money"", even though barely benefit amount, etc.

Basically unemployment system mess, can't handle everything that's going right now, there's also lot vague confusing information hard tell what's right. hoping call get cleared up, able get all. mean gyms closed it’s truly safe people work without mask, you’re legit delusional think cooking mask anyway similar strenuous workout mask o. appreciate stand someone weight. feel like, gyms obvious transmission vectors require masks, they've basically become ""safe spaces"" people deny significance pandemic.

I recently quit gym similar reasons. I'd going go sit hot tub outside avoiding actual gym masks required. leaving, dude started cussing *for wearing mask common areas.* literally loss words probably better. miss hot tub, honestly, there's way I'd stepping foot onto gym floor coming month two CoVID anyways like really getting money's worth. Hopefully English steroid thing works. Abbot allowing communities mandate masks madness. bike mask sometimes run friends bike along side them. don’t notice difference difficulty. Yes, it’s certainly hoax. would really consider getting news from, though. There’s much fake news everywhere pandemic really shouldn’t getting information Facebook comments reddit threads. Look verified information trustworthy news websites instead.

But topic mean live Vietnam friends got taken homes quarantine assure guns involved. Good news tourists going reopened Disney... Pizza pizza I'd quit too. needs insane skanks Big Igloo freaks doxxing threatening family. Fuck shit. matter scale.

Every day metro NYC used 4.3 million people. Sweden population 10 millions vs 8 millions NYC. Density 25 per square km sweden vs 10000+ NYC. New york started lockdown covid already widespread. It’s don’t know.

:) FTFY problem bars restaurants can't eat drink masks. Unless outdoor seating remain closed, IMO. signed lease LA. Granted good salary hospital, following rental rates last 4 months, noticed decrease busy markets. anything per zillow less listings, less supply keeps rates up. think supply increase, coming year see prices pressured down. mean... Aramaic? wrong. find funny people expect white house use peasant tactics they've got real deal. stay safe home, ~~terrorists~~ virus won. randomly seeded exponential growth.

Imagine starting 10 fires patchy field grass random. fires burn local fuel since happened start small patches grass. One fire though, started big patch, quickly engulfs patch grows large enough blown wind encompass field reach next one.

Every individual coronavirus case grows exponentially specific branches tree grow others die one reason another. could run nursing home perfectly still you’d frequent deaths. way you’ll ever change fountain youth. Reduced capacity would fine except cases capacity low either go wait line long time. closed anyone want waste day (or time) waiting line. Shocking.....  deaths low scary part.

We going okay :) Total case absolutely doubling less week NY. touch.

He scapegoating avoid responsible failures.

It's thing do. lot ones tied Memorial day, casino opening didn’t help differ. Love pizza! cmon man Costco pizza? Rather get mom pop shop They’ve already achieved herd immunity though - reason facts... nuts also try frame terms ""many die lockdown covid!"" widespread view U.S. China bigger problems worry right trying spread anti-U.S. propaganda. seems care others lot too. main reason wear mask yourself. it’s probably both. one, could increase pay facilities taking making government-run. 

Over 25% workers make less $12 hour. Steroid abuse well-known contribute cardiac Tx. Gov well &amp; wonder governors knew virus wld get worst states opened memorial day early knew &amp; ounce guilt done many ppl caught covid virus many dead. think know 1/3rd. Two weeks exponential increases sufficient. Dude stop. Go home. think happened 2008-2009?

I left Navy needed place stay 3 months joined 32yr old brother living mom's place. bought house, stayed mom's another year. Why? fault. Welcome New York, southern friends. tried warn you. Omg, US fucked. saw, numbers rising fast Arizona, Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Nevada, probably places missed. Smh true, since shut can't shut now. That's true. Good point Lol president united states told otherwise, directly shows actions masks unnecessary virus mostly went away (by last Easter). let’s blame Trump NY nursing home outbreaks... curious too. copyright article suggests ClickOrlando part WKMG, byline says reporter News 6 since March 2019. WKMG-TV, Channel 6, CBS-affiliated television station owned Graham Media Group. I'm Florida native, none pops red flag bad news organization. would imagine local Orlando media carry 'This happening airport' story specifically governor's public remarks identified central Florida airport without mentioning name. Guess sun isnt blasting away enough positive I’m betting due policy problem over. Ha! Thanks :-) I'd link clip I'm eating dinner Trying imagine living country missing TWO people infected COVID-19 would enough create national uproar. go wrong? case two Californias. LA area 100,000 infections adding thousands day Bay Area around 15,000 adding hundred day. whole state Bay numbers would lot lower largest medical complex galaxy, good man. thought bathroom last safe Bastion. wrong. asking provide proof, providing none own, want specify study type? 

A Randomized Control Trial study verified outcome shows benefit health care workers community members households wearing mask respirator ***only way*** prove scientifically face masks benefit. asked specific type study. 

But study exists. 

There literally thousands studies done - including one linked, proves nothing. one based 'analyzing trend mitigation measures Wuhan, China, Italy, New York City, January 23 May 9, 2020'. far many varying factors consider anything hypothesis. know likely talking wall here, 

No - willing change opinion - science backs reasons wearing masks. date, hasn't. 

If government told sticking banana arse would help stop spread Covid-19, would question it, would stick banana arse? 

At point use critical part brain start asking questions instead spoonfed advice politicians? People bringing virus skiing trips mostly alps, many 30's 40's remember right first case visitations nursing homes people hospital allowed little access elderly. old people closed younger people basically infecting other. 21 states experienced day day rolling increase NBA MLS players staff supposed fly airport again? Next week? Think *The Terminator* came out. comments section sub, news sub Facebook... hence original question. social media hoax, unless y'all lying. Confirmed happened guess. suggest? can’t keep running facilities like prison way we’ve this. point allow flow visitors public quality life go way down. 

There already strict infection control regulations we’ve increased significantly. don’t stop virus putting someone 14 day quarantine every time see doctor leave facility isn’t sustainable. 

All takes one asymptomatic worker admit it’s in. it’s almost impossible stop one two infections due latency period. disinfect like nature job human human contact throughout day. 

The way stop wiping facilities constant testing actual shutdown compliance areas even infections, testing quality contact tracing enforced quarantine positive individuals contact. don’t know capabilities latter. 

Instead governors opening states facilities, placing responsibility facilities alone. That’s going work. Virus getting message politicians safe go bars, restaurants, salon, political rallies, etc. Virus pretty stupid. use brain get program. Either gives people freedom blames people spreading it, institutes police state cops go around enforcing distancing quarantine, effectively enraging chunk population. cant win. It’s apt though. Herds classically groups animals (usually mammals) subject predation pacts animals. virus acts “predator” case. Also word herd used collective animals tend act together. common livestock works talking public health directives well. 

It might flattering word, sociology discussion I’m sure word like “collective” would used, it’s meant cattle probably best word scientific community has. world turns blind eye organ harvesting minorities China? Chinas trade partners ok this? find hard believe. two days, looked like employees mask on. Place seems cleaned. course regular travelers probably 30%-40% wearing masks. buy anything go near soul sat corner mask board flight. almost like live different cities saw different protests. I'm 34 moved back father 2019. husband toddler tow. brother sister-in-law already living too!

The idea save house, well... may compound while. Whew thats great news, gotta get Texas, tour saying hospital admins theoughout state. They'll glad hear! need put date headline articles, hard tell one day another point. Maybe intentionally ? Like, someone asked to, may work gym didn’t effect policy Mr. has...js. Glad it, though. tell based twitter facebook comments yelling open cost.

""Stay home scared""

Yes, everyone totally ability that. least wore point. Sweden seen single person wear mask outside leaders consistently told everyone ""masks help"" - including state epidemiologist. I'm really curious hear people unsatisfied US response would think Sweden's, lol. nice. way could add line total tests performed testing positivity percentage data showing new cases? feel like either metric would help provide context case numbers Lack focus education several generations? ""*They say gyms, bars businesses able reopen - combined Memorial Day weekend gatherings mass protests - saw social distancing pandemic practices go window.* ""

That even count tourist came casinos, spent money, went home.

I'm waiting new souvenir shirt, ""I went Vegas got crappy T-Shirt Covid"" common people, mega corporations? insane? Unfortunately, possible co-exist contain something running exponential growth. heartbreaking. Maybe silver lining people start realize horrible conditions many nursing homes figure improve standards. forgot “Gov ____ says increased cases solely due increased testing....no followup questions please” Bullshit. city, every protest saw/participated almost everyone wearing mask. **［June 17th OUTBREAK ALERT］** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

Good luck that. Nobody saying need shut year. told that? thing. Expect reduced capacity restaurants &amp; public establishments, social distancing, masks. None happening shutdown, cases rising exponentially.

We've managed flatten curve, need keep flat open back up. Guarantee southern hospitality best region Sweden hospitality also applies states laws preventing evictions. Yes, right can't evicted, soon period passes can. news, advertising. rhetorical question really dude, thank answering. I've sub since March, still find hard comprehend idiocy.

For balance, got phone client UK, says 10-15% wearing there, guys. what's confusing bribes moral corruption ? good chunk people already it. people even notice get it. people get ill, nobody really dies except people would died anyway.

We listened scientists, made nonsense models predicting end world based real data. we'll never trust again. assuming HUGE number unknown cases, brazil least soon reach herd imunity rate,... Hospitals gonna love handing 100k bills like candy. jarring eye opening situation life whole I've ever had. Disgusting Probably follows social distancing. happens group people told something benefit everybody, go, “OK.”

Take note ‘murica. agree trolls part,but data error Maharashtra's side(many deaths reported late late,so added today's death count). PA shutdown nowhere near strict, especially applied governor's cabinet making business. SARS-CoV-2 Clover Biopharmaceuticals

Isn’t exactly planned centralized approach first (officially) also convinced switch decentralized one later? reason deaths higher neighbors virus got spread around elder care facilities, poorly trained underequipped staff. Many people working facilities poor people can’t afford stay home turn brought infection back families, many cases live close quarters small apartments - especially Stockholm. It’s also uncommon staff employment hours every week work several facilities, means it’s enough people spread different facilities nightmare hands. 

Take regretful deaths equation we’re par Nordic neighbors comes deaths general population. protecting elderly nursing homes huge failure, explain higher death rate, death rate people connected nursing homes. virus soon leave disease Mexico. Well flip fundamental facts recent history absolute child play Also widespread view America still protect others degree

South Korea President impeached letting 300 student drown skincare. dude let virus ruin whole ecomomy stupidity still ppl dying there. How???? glad shorten something like CoWaApp 401K wiped great recession. pandemic wipeout even 401Ks. govt relaxed rules 401ks make likely people lose money them.  died yes. considering survive they're spreading innocent people unfortunately cross path outside churches, really. right wear pants.


I absolutelny problem that, basically whole excuse argument invalid. Fucking assholes. Young perverts brought disease southern border Mexico. Really sorry hear this. covid survivors outlet talk stuff? see hashtags, see subreddits even reddit posts. need hear stuff like survivors like you. Got hardcore conservative family members. Somehow become political thing. wear mask pansy liberal. One even posted bullshit article wearing masks makes likely get virus.

The funny thing people super high risk dying this.

There guy lost 5 members family virus. There's much do. much try reason sheer right wing studity. They're going fucking idiots.

Make mistake, there's huge subset population fucking deserve get sick idiots. unfortunate fact bound determined drag us them. almost wish confederacy independence. would built wall around south locked idiots 3rd world country die virus. god sent covid punish gay people somehow always starts church goers /s issue invading 6 foot physical distancing others. I’m honestly surprised mask wearing become something normal now. People used like bandaid felt healed, ripped off. That’s see least. even wear masks first place didn’t intend legit solved issue. definitely feel like don’t make progress. expert say one thing another contradicts flops completely use others original statement. It’s ridiculous still long way go. Again, people using masks like bandaid simply take think it’s time. Replace China World I've never downvoted anybody cake day changed that. Nobody deserves get covid man, terrible disease potential lasting damages. widespread saying America. ‘No shit, Sherlock?’ taking about? drove daily 250 Km buy milk morning.

Good thing really placed stores cover population old guys better looking you... I'm thinking 300k, including ""excess deaths"" figure around 44k.

I'm Germany. Masks mandatory indoor locations people still gather, that's many. There's also widepsread view China clash Indian army, worst clash border 50+ years, even newsworthy.

Maybe state-run media? colombian president, popularity really low, 29% only. also involved scandal drug dealer, covid-19 came everyone forgot this. horrible president managed situation well, popularity rise again. still 2 years go tho T.T don’t compare us neighbors, it’s early judge. Look strategy superior because... Excess deaths compared time last year 4 year suggest otherwise. Canada looks like good option. friend talked making move. Probably never gonna happen hurt dream Mine too. really damn sad. 

As enough: truly hope soon. hear Swedes, even formally Tegnell worshiping ones, start question strategy. even there's refrain rising question strategy outright ""Test, Trace, Isolate"" *always* strategy. bit akin saying ""we always war Oceania"" hey means TTI cards, I'll take it! seems change coming, way since week 21 imo. government saying wants implement Test, Trace, Isolate.... However says huge part budget testing contact tracing go antibody tests, facepalm! Hopefully get massive pushback that... Antibody tests interesting research standpoint, need PCR TTI. Funding antibody PCR bad signal, unfortunately. hey least discussion TTI now. 

So tremendous amount hope yet, feel *more* hopeful before. point? ever heard ""tone top""? Research suggests impacts organization greatly. I'm shocked food workers . 


While may seem like shitty time terms power employees excellent time get executives work employee demands.  


If life worth risked worth risked according demands. Source 48 yesterday? Seems 6, no? don’t know healthcare worker, could gotten work pass onto friends. also idiots common Thank-you - terrible title. 

“Arnold Schwarzenegger leaves legendary gym due members wearing wearing masks.“. 

How hard that? Dude's 80 years old, attending rally even Coronavirus literally even exist. Honestly death rate low already know this. bad virus ignore him. dictator took control democracy, could go wrong 118,000 dead, confirmed test

Calling BS this. I've seen directives CDC saying die cancer cough couple days before, count covid death. anything we're over-counting. Unfortunately makes attention grabbing headline. Wars ultimate human sacrifice loss. What's worse vicious cycle

 people willing go crowded bar 15 friends going properly isolate virus could fooled me. Boy sure convenient excuse rationale behind every country region worse Sweden, region better caused superior strategy handling.

So convenient. hunch... good one PhD biochemistry. 

Wife asks definitives time response:

I mean, maybe. imagine scenario could possible factor probability one happening other. possibilities, random, sure one could happen. 

Then says take garbage today even it’s tomorrow asshole. dont know lying know it. Buenos Aires really big city nowhere near 50% total population. around 44M right? AMBA around 13M Im mistaken? know numbers well. Agreed. Let's fill baby maximum capacity! Standing room only! Thanks pointing out. Inserting UV light rectum I've told. Swedish online herd seems happy enough it: Haha narrow minded comparison. Qing dynasty didn’t collapse due weak, hesitant incompetent emperors. Main issue failure reforms, rebellions, foreign invaders capable economically greater military power Qing still living like way hundred year ago. 

U.S internal issues lot easier deal there’s major foreign invader risk least next 50 years. way head scientific military power diverse people earth. 

We fine next decades China difficult decades coming. great internal conflicts, power struggle aggressive foreign activity toward China. often is, additional cross comparisons death tolls (a familiar war example) help people wrap heads around immense numbers difficult imagine. 

But knew think? PSAs reason. Click ticket, brain drugs, mask casket. next year 4 Lol Murphy's law! Trying sound scientific justifying stupidity. Well it’s two weeks don’t think we’ve seen noticeable spike due protests we? ridiculous would say something similar regarding different topic, like “We stayed inside arctic winter 3 months (October January) decided go dressed like it’s spring it’s 3 WHOLE MONTHS long want winter last we’re shocked us frostbite”. Here’s thing Karen, go pandemic done us, we’re done pandemic. states BIG protests like Minnesota report Covid tests reported tiny number while, tests going backlogged places.

Yup. Live MN Walz made public statement telling ANYONE protest get tested. Told let staff testing center know reason test get it.

A lot sites get memo protesters turned away sites still symptomatic tests. Every site seems know *now* lack tests protesters definitely thing. see Pence op-ed WSJ basically saying ""there second wave - media hyping it"". Read people's reactions another forum, number people basically falling line agreeing utter complete nonsense STAGGERING. 

Yeah, Mike..we'll ignore huge increases Texas, Arizona, Florida elsewhere pretend happening. Because, going believe? lying eyes, sycophant VP that's hawking whatever total BS boss wants spin? facts m'am. ""Maybe ignore it'll go away?""
-every politician ever. Sure, like Canada anything control either. They're pushing date back borders restrict movement slow rate infection, fear Americans bringing virus north. Infection rates Canada almost identical US outside New York. “no one told would bad.” could normal human remember mink farming horrible... fuck mink farmers. going worse New York. would hunker down, curbside pickup wash groceries coming house. Good luck getting this. Dr Pence say won’t happen! Actually since we’re even first wave, might right Swedish brigade putting positive spin this: fact masks politicized US reason enough call failed state. worst thing! Let's let people go really choose to, way see bad thing really I'm sure interpret /s here, Sweden seems sweet spot they've catastrophic disease, hard hit economy close coming herd immunity.

If US percentage, would 45 million people sick close half million dead.  It’s dark remember months ago bodies piling outside nyc waiting loaded refrigerated truck, btw fda approved use transferring food goods again. I'm floridian. guys come down, one catch one parents likely pass away long term complications. everything stop this, literally refuse leave house.

IDC get grouneded beaten, call child services. LEAVE STATE FLORIDA. lot people believe two men longer right consentually wrestle money. zero control that. China? I’m Canada live fear border opening.  people keep saying this? missing something? like 5500 cases per million, total US numbers, ranked like #22 state-by-state basis.

is growth accelerating compared others?  Thanks, stay safe well! COVID actually brought immediate family back home, see sibling mom. nice roof, we've impressive arguments! Seems like countries view China’s response negatively ones always viewed China negatively period. would study talk comorbidities? study living effects virus long term. Dead people even counted Study. Yes studies need completed, mean Succulentmenditator making random statement. understand comparisons war. compared pandemics? data seen shows demand weak. makes sense since:

1) people less disposable income

2) people 100 percent convinced safe go out

3) restaurant experience fun pandemic funny, China massive outbreak capital city important market. outbreak bad, Chinese authorities hilariously blaming ""imported salmon"" instead taking responsibility community spread capital. might well pin statement top sub. going accurate headline certainly accelerate year. burning question travel/hospitality reaches pre-covid levels. Cruises, airlines, hotels heavily leveraged industries margins always tight competition. longer takes hit pre-cv revenues fallout industries Bc equal equal people LA County alone yesterday 2,959 deaths.

http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=2447 Eventually 2 weeks lot people. Go see psychiatrist need help buddy. Kept hearing summer would kill virus off. That's NOPE. incompetent governor right? state beach holiday planned

We made tough decision family cancel yearly family reunion beach vacation. made tougher seeing people social media feeds taken trips posting beach pics, etc.

Deep know right thing, tough.

Now family members wife's side asking we're coming visit. live area 150 TOTAL cases, whereas area gets almost daily. Sorry. going visiting anytime soon. Sally hate grandma? SE Michigan, seems like everyone us (wife me) think COVID ""over done with"".

People everywhere parks, trails, downtown areas - virtually ZERO wearing masks.

I tried go favorite bike trail yesterday I've going totally nuts able yet year, place de-stress. BAD IDEA. Dozens dozens people jogging, walking, biking, etc. Saw grand total TWO people roughly 100 wearing masks me. stayed 10 minutes giving up, came home really, really pissed totally depressed rest night. Yesterday good.

So, MANY PEOPLE FREAKING MORONS, (and others) basically left choice either things would like able (I know, #FirstWorldProblems - get it), risk getting deadly virus possibly winding really, really sick - worse.

Even best friend going trail bunch - mask. 100% opinion he'd never over. Yeah, ""I'm DONE whole thing"" even got - he's got health issues higher risk me..plus 6 years older. SMH.. Jacksonville? Facepalm number tests says nothing. percentage positives per people tested need look at. Please use head mate. Even Austria handled pretty well far... monday wear masks stores lifted majority people run around without masks. stores also stopped providing hand sanitizer entrance, basically letting run bit thats left screw it.

Another economy shut like unlikely, hope infection rate starts rise put basic safety precautions back place.

Until vaccine ready new normal ppl start get used it. see people still claim something that's killed almost 120,000 Americans less 5 months (all ~100 deaths past 3 months) somehow ""fake"". Especially we're past ""That's Americans died fighting World War I"" milestone.  wear mask outside AZ heat 10 hours straight. it, fucking anybody can! thing hate it! tired. true working vaccine don’t intend stop, I’m put family risk coronavirus. Control things control. CDC one point said contaminated surface spread main transmission method virus, later clarified statement confirming get sick contaminated surfaces (fomites) person-to-person spread far common.

The studies widely published coronavirus survive cardboard 24 hours, plastics 2-3 days.

Yes “laboratory conditions,” studies there. WebMD lists times. doorknobs it’s longer...

The potential definitely exists contaminated surface infect you. Since it’s impossible, I’ll continue wiping groceries matter names redditors call me. posted exact question got made fun least 2-3 people would respond they’re still wiping groceries too. Right idea, wrong motivation. 

They calculated early lockdowns going cause economic damage base would find unacceptable. response commit narrative virus could controlled, economic losses would minimal, public health impact would somewhere ebola hit shores (and got pretty much nowhere) flu. flu makes sense trust-your-gut sort way they're flu like symptoms, incubate days, etc, right? course, know better analogy like common cold might kill affect pretty much system blood (taste/smell, obviously respiratory, neurological symptoms, cardiovascular problems, etc) damage might permanent. 

By time empirical results various countries' approach started show lockdown backfired every time, already political (and associated emotional) commitment. federal government much way coalitions parties used hard pivots. 

As such, message stayed -- health impact, tolerable despite exaggeration people want make lose fall, America's Greatness power economic resurgance envy rest world. 

There excess deaths every year conservative policies (environmental, health coverage routine care, support substance abuse, etc) marched idea elections hinge economics, base prioritizes personal prosperity public health, no-brainer downplay virus figure give drug companies months they'll come pill something suppress health crisis acceptable levels election. we'll herd immunity anyway. 

The obvious problem playing closer worst case scenarios. mentioned, thing spreads like cold flu difficult trace. also extremely evasive immune system: according Roosevelt study, 40% infected antibodies might prevent re-infection *1-3 months* hoping 2-3 year immunity. 

While we've made breakthroughs treating precipise death, whole studies virus raise questions answer. announced today treatment could reduce fatality rate effectively zero really change scared thing. many patients infected early, ""recovered"", continue serious health effects months later. 

Imagine 20-40 year old, ""mild"" case shortness breath, clearing virus, 60 days later still can't walk stairs without getting winded, *and* realize immune response reinfection probably half worn may get thing feel like never actually got ""mild"" case months prior. 

As WH continues entrench original position, becomes difficult pivot. also question pivot *to*? can't un-politicize outlook, switch people they've criticizing along stand give away election. 

At end day, surpasses worst nightmare nowhere go now. That's there's much pressure push through. 

Blech, sorry wall text. sad. Oh silly - taxpayers sent money government yet, there's 25 Trillion (plus interest!) paid get latest 500 billion. China nothing control either. Beijing lockdown proof.  new deaths reaching record lows... see, one thing random people internet take context make jokes it.

It's another boss repeats out-of-context line *is dead fucking serious* it, uses excuse take 0 precautions workplace. area extremely fancy restaurants this. kind places can’t afford. would guess...Australia. Source? AEW back FL, taping shows Daily's Place Jacksonville, WWE deemed essential. People could least try stick facts, despite wrestling carny business.

The essential employees need employed ""professional sports media production national audience"". actually opens many different sports choose tapings FL. Totally understand unlikely get virus shared surfaces, possible method transmission game basketball. basketball literally get face-to-face others heavily breathing perspiring heavily. Maybe outside cuts risk never convince completely safe outside 

Watch basketball game, pay attention many people go rebounds close players guard jostle positioning.

Also, transmission two players opposite teams already occurred NBA, look Rudy Gobert Christian Wood, albeit obviously indoors, stadium. Terminator 36 years old! People like worrying going pool pandemic exact reason could deal it. hubris Americans immense. Last weekend finally left Jersey crossed Delaware foot Lambertville New Hope... first impression: oh God, life place, stupid could taking advantage it? Second: crowded sidewalks, distancing inside out, masks seen least worn, bars packed gills. like portal another planet NJ. terrible milestone

Agreed. heart sank saw (+102) deaths. enough?  I'm also Texas. 1200 gets 1/1 apartment Austin. Extremely unlikely, outside basically zero contact except reservist cleaner person meet. young old people. I've seen dozen teens partying (more like hanging out) beach social distancing also group size older people thing. young old people social distancing social distancing one age group following rules. Also, I've seen many older people without masks too. virus care age. spread anyone matter age. Rent gone market. impossible find lower-middle class income homes even apartments rent. People downgrading taking cheaper housing. watch Zillow respond instant something listed already gone. 

I called one real estate agent yesterday house listed 17 minutes picked said already application. like trying buy car Craigslist tax time. ridiculous. wrong about? Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly, cause inflation. Burns ass hear COVID hoax people saying ""well deaths nursing home people, healthy people street."" 

People people number third USA death total.  course it’s totally people feel safe with. guess I’m talking people want things stay shut even longer expect people stay home ignore new phase 2/3 freedoms feel it’s responsible thing do. Basically people projecting paranoia morally superior choice. afraid also highly concerned state economy, I’ll taking advantage freedoms come up. sounds like life covid! say! Meanwhile I’m Iowa negotiated $200 less month current market value virus kills people left right. either die wind ventilator. need shut vaccine keep shutdown enough people get vaccine it’s safe worry economy  Boy dumb? know last went supermarket, wide variety beans pulses alone, mention carbohydrate rich foods pasta rice. long shelf lives, supply chains rely refrigeration there's risk spoil - easy stockpile provide demand. 
Furthermore, there's less demand meat, means less animals needed, turn means meat industry needs less food feed animals, frees food humans. 
On top that, beans, pulses cereals amongst cheapest food products available, even price increase due demand, could still buy calories amount money get buy meat current prices. leading example... getting herd immunity^(TM) There's big-ass difference protesting getting haircut (indoors state capital, masks) protesting murders (outside, masks). 

It's hard believe really can't see difference. One favorite signs ""Surprise Planned Parenthood"". makes laugh every time see it. Long term strategy: reduce damage threat either finding vaccine, better treatment wait herd immunity kick in. strategies, Sweden admitting they, like everyone else, choose one strategies. letting hospitals getting overrun good, still means end. Sweden wont say end. Coin printing machine go clink clank clink cling clang I’d swear people want hospitals get overwhelmed get NY level apocalypse again. literally point flattening curve. Check daily death rates European country show ONE case patterns no.  don’t believe me, ask Johns Hopkins’ epidemiologist E.F.Ding  shows CUMULATIVE deaths. Cumulative means **increasing increased quantity, degree, force successive additions.**

If add 1+1, get 2.

If add 1 that, get 3.

If add 1 that, get 4.

Do see going here?

If keep adding numbers base number, goes up. never goes down.

Christ, man - really consider basic maths classes. 8 year old kid understands shit - can't you? news water still wet Damn dude. pretty lucky then. Excess mortality suggests Texas undercounting factor 2-3. say normal, imo. humans need social contact, humans also get bit stir-crazy forced constant proximity people dislike (think bad roommates, toxic parents). I'd say actual normal able choose works individual basis. know I'd hate move back parents, good productivity emotional health. big jug coins want cash bank. unfortunately bank wont take roll coin counter machine :( chance Swedish funeral services industry? hear you, grew Ny Nj moved fast Ca (lol know). Rent sucks work plentiful least. you’re risk illness catch came lockdown.

I said original post hypothetically, sub clearly one agenda disagree debate you’re murderer. got 3.0, 30 year fixed conventional. 118k house - 742$ month. End March. consent can't leave. housing market drops due foreclosures, rent go like 2008? People probably melting old copper trading 😂 leased place yesterday 2-3 months looking prices either stayed gone slightly. I'm North New Orleans.  Rentals gone almost soon get posted. $1.25 / sf high compared 2 years ago. get demand month month payment usually paired significant fee threat pay they'll come court. big? I'm dtsj paying $1600 250 sq ft studio dying get cooped here. Yup.

The heat may slow transmission, outside. rationale impossible contain schools open, children ability social distance. Come fall we're going either open schools sacrifice future though - achieve containment well enough make possible, lot people going die. Give people go actually need then, like Lupus patients Don’t cross borders? surely locking reducing exposure bacteria / viruses day day life adverse affect immune systems.

We're talking months here, decade. Also, assume people going outside slowly seeing friends family. I'm you. money saving visit city world blast, go back home still money left over.

It's UK, would pay £1500 rent small two bed flat London £550 mortgage three bedroom house 90 minutes Central London? I'm getting paid 3x much job moved what's point?

With money save literally go anywhere world multiple times year, eat fanciest restaurants every week go every concert want. Big city people crazy. Hopefully sooner. Half population world would dead severely crippled smarter states doing: mandatory 14 day quarantine crossing border. definitely propaganda. notice complete lack negative news central government? Sure, scapegoats abound, criticize central government.

Really hope Abbott override mandate. Outstanding.

The nurses Hong Kong proved medicine move governments bit “listen us you’ll worst possible strike.” peoples innate biases certain types threats. reason compare vehicle deaths spider bites terrorism. He's 70 lift heavy anymore, especially heart surgery. I'm guessing longer anything prove. browse around Youtube, see lot machines now, moderate amount weight. least city well easing cases get flat. normal data covid-19 Sweden see worldometer indeed facts.

Stop sniffing Trump juice.

Stop incorrect: stage, cases increasing good sign. UK testing numbers increased 10x last two months, result bit plateau, positives still 4x since. Making anything mandatory possible. 

Let's say Governor tells everyone must wear mask. Sooner later people comply local law enforcement ""enforce"" since consider infringement peoples rights. lets forget various judge/lawyers love shoot anything coming governor/mayor.

I agree you, going happen. long anyway. Better alternative.  Clearly either enforced insufficient. Machine translation Mine went up. Crazy huh? America. think implied ""got shit together"" tested earlier week. Came back negative. chances caught testing site? roll car window nasal swab army reservist could direct it. That’s good sign Kawasaki motorbike brand.... DC pay 1,200 bedroom -_- Montgomery divert week ago, sending patients UAB due hitting capacity, I’m certain hasn’t gotten better cases spread. Hello MD though family there. sure mean cases continuing fall? looks like rising? missing? Yes, according multiple sources are. ""Backing claim, epidemiologists point concurrent rise many states increased coronavirus hospitalizations, well rise percentage positive results tests."" 

Also keep mind "" Rebekah Jones fired Florida Health Department alleges refused resign said asked modify data make certain regions appear like met requirements reopen."" antiviral sense, didn’t compare said utilization vitamins?!? misunderstanding statement. 

It definitely potential needs much research. also like provide actual sources debunking uses collodial silver, surprised many times comes articles ”debunking” without scientific claims, please dont send tiresome link someone turning blue argyria.

Here EU-study disproving common Ummm Spanish flu pretty bad. polio. 

We've also realitivly mild pandemics since then. Like Hong Kong flu H1N1 flu. Even Russian flu 1890s these. no, pandemics ""black swan"" events. They're unpredictable. old. I'm NYC spring break streets bro. People scared beginning. they're not. talking rate spread, talking mortality rate, sat 2.2% states lot higher national average 5%. seemed suspect me. appears comments thread numbers counted death toll. ask honest question? negotiate lease? I'm first apartment increased rent first year, right pandemic hit. already want move something anyone do? Thank advance! openings limited places offer _most_ societal benefit. Restaurants bars economic activity, would represent major sectors imploding remain shut down. Beaches supposed best hope getting people home isolation still safe - better worse remain best option regard. 

People able share laundromat pool trade-off. feels like silly political shadow boxing sides. Denmark bases policy popular vote anything. Sweden cries discrimination like baby points Swedes recommended go countries, try look top. 
What’s sad there’s sign “nordisk samarbejde”. country gaining anything borders closed, fact they’re losing lot. I’m invested enough know reality borders Norway Finland. can’t see Region Skåne Region Hovestaden couldn’t set joint venture TTI ease back region normality. it’s Denmark vs Stockholm, doesn’t really care Skåne. 

There interesting chat DR director Dansk Industri professor virology answered questions. pretty interesting see Danes wanted ask also answers quite fair taking sides. % positive (the reliable predictor future hospitalization) much lower NY locked down, though it’s difficult make direct comparison testing capacity also greatly increased since (though TX still shoddy area). Wtf y’all rent increases??? you’re still living there????? Amazon rainforest hardest hit coronavirus. Sweden's mortality rate follows pattern every European country.

Um... no.  don’t believe me, ask Johns Hopkins’ epidemiologist government intervene, deaths confirmed cases flat. r/angryupvote It’s slippery slope. one people complaining unmasked joggers see packed gym unmasked it’s like witnessing war crime. won’t complain joggers anymore. run around outside want get flak me. stay away other. Swedish media, re-title push like. blame media. 

From read article, sounds like fear keeping people carrying per normal.

There risk yes, need put risk perspective. Worldwide Covid-19 deaths haven’t yet surpassed motor vehicle accident deaths year. know risks, us comfortable risk/benefit analysis, comfortable assuming risk essential things, also pleasure well like vacations. isn’t us risk drive. children playing, motorists, sometimes everything right someone also run red light kill us. accept risk. everything convenient reasonable reduce risk, aren’t prepared shut driving solve it, even though would stop motor vehicle deaths entirely. benefits driving simply great.

But media relies clicks generate revenue now. Clicks extremely competitive click generating headline win. generates clicks? Fear. hard wired pay attention threats. scarier make sound, click, money make. Politicians respond base voter’s opinions motivation power. voter’s opinions generated system.

If read articles Covid way usually huge caveat attention-grabbing headline, plain misleading.

Sort sub controversial. see good news. People hate good news downvote it. Thanks, nice read. appreciate it. export virus city closed domestic flights hundred cases upset, can't imagine angry country 2 million cases shut international flights. could give earlier mid-2021 least major sporting events 2020 rescheduled 2021 unless athletes fully healthy. What’s going stop Alabama bringing extra doctors? (That’s saw post mods deleted getting political).

Supply doctors.

That’s it.

Doctors finite resource, take really long time make.

There’s whole lot spare, NYC faced little competition supply early pandemic, could afford pay triple normal rates plus per diem travel, it’s different now.

Some travel docs nurses taking break, saw serious death weeks end need swell time.

The bulk travel docs nurses tied contracts virus spreads.

Now AL try attract docs nurses like NYC, they’d pay far NYC doctors nurses fully aware nightmare CoVID19.

So AL won’t able expand, there’s ability so.

Very sad. Might able afford property central texas Texas reports 3,600 new cases need everyone board face masks. would obviously bring salaries down. sue Surely top neurosurgeon could available information.

This entirely state-by-state though. Many states closed economy suppress virus, able reopen. Others pay lip service to...who knows...and probably wasted time ready get serious dealing problem. active r/svenskpolitik necessarily know left wing politics... Lol Im manager mcdonalds. make $15 hour responsibilities handle. We're incredibly understaffed. get pillaged daily. I'm lucky half employees show shift. Corporate gave us $1 raise risk go away supposedly we're getting bonus knows. people owning business making almost 50k week (I see numbers), thats 200k month paying 10-15% labor most, paying minimum wage kids working quit. Forcing employees multiple peoples jobs wage. lol they're going blame china  sue people get flu? worst kind baby. still keep drive margaritas?? /s meant supplement along 401ks IRAs etc PLUS, Fixed-Benefit Pension plans. Roosevelt called ""three-legged stool"" support. 

Employers reneged part bargain stopped providing fixed benefit plans. Oh, think mask usage disturbing thing you’ll encounter Florida...I’ve got bad news you. Mask wearing situation either works 100% effectiveness none all. (And really messed take stance literally one reddit *doesn't* already know fully. Even read headlines.) wear it, protection provides. lower mask eat, mean ""defeated purpose"" mask. way defeat purpose mask cynical ever wear all. said they're going normal lives like nothing going on. people see believe it, unless talking religion. hit extremely hard, 500+ death seem enough wake people yet. We're supposed volunteer state, asking people voluntarily wear masks worked. guess I'd say 75% people wearing here. caring fellow Tennesseans really disappointing. Randomized Control Trial study verified outcome shows benefit health care workers community members households wearing mask respirator. ***There study. exceptions.*** 

There many randomized controlled trials meta-analyses RCTs, designed detect benefit wearing mask, terms reducing risk infected viral respiratory disease.

In many studies, known bias self-reporting eliminated using laboratory-confirmed infection detection, statistically meaningful advantage ever found, either health-care community settings, either surgical masks N95 respirators. study, many, able establish advantage wearing mask respirator, viral respiratory diseases.

 means that, ***even controlled professional health-care settings, benefit small detected science.***

Therefore, debate virtue responsibility wearing mask reduce risk infection, occurring science vacuum. political, emotional psychological debate, one science-based. 

If people choose wear masks, that's right so, trying impose mask wearing people purely emotional politically driven. answer question, - mortality rate enough justify mandatory wearing fucking masks. Nine states — Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina Texas — reported either new single-day highs set record seven-day new coronavirus case averages Tuesday, according Washington Post analysis. least 115,000 people United States died coronavirus, 2,126,000 cases Nonetheless, Vice President Pence said Tuesday fears second wave infections “overblown.” Wall Street Journal op-ed, Pence, leads White House coronavirus task force, claimed “the media tried scare American people.” problem though - British Columbian perspective - often feel like we're represented well nation's capital.

To bring state like California, whose population larger Canada, going throw things even proportion.

Sorry.  dropped imagine potus got corona near election day... trump dumbass gym 3 months... someone normally goes EVERY SINGLE Day... wear mask ill gladly wear go back again. 

but mean rich enough, I'm surprised gym. Big difference zero input decision making. gonna get there's nothing do. rest probably could taken steps reduce exposure Psst bot, missed one, right you. Agreed. Especially people think ""safe"" distancing 6ft apart. Yet engaging rigorous physical activity, 6ft longer nearly enough. talking like 15 ft. State Parks closed means stop state visitors Covid Refugees sources contagion. Let alone take sip water meant supplement along 401ks IRAs etc PLUS, Fixed-Benefit Pension plans. Roosevelt called ""three-legged stool"" support. 

Employers reneged part bargain stopped providing fixed benefit plans. Archive link: http://archive.vn/U3Vul LOL idk downvoted ""I never said that."" \~ Pence 3 months also Boston see things, maybe people aware here? people said staged. What’s Trump declaring World War 3...you know...because wartime president US. US, many (most?) hospitals rationing masks requiring ER Medical staff reuse disposable masks (often days) well outside safety guidelines. Don’t forget groups pay front line, *cough cough NFL cough cough* Exactly. hated NYS virus ravaging state (a lot NYC im thankfully). 

But I’m kind glad better states now. Yesterday county actually zero new confirmed cases. Yeah, random guys YouTube get unbiased news opinions well! You’re outside open air dumb motherfucker Yeah Virus give damn nothing that. Unless money going give us cure, even like mobile app game chucking money problem make solve sooner. breed it’s maddening.  Yeah, worst case scenario case others superspreaders. Fingers crossed weren't. 15k protest June 7, wait see bad result is. Ten days enough time, good sharp spike yet. DK 511 active known cases right now, similar many lately actually bit lower past days. US clearly fallen far, far behind education. wear mask stay away people much possible. hard understand. Let's accurate.  simple majority voters voted HRC.  vast majority two-thirds majority.  got 3 million votes Trump total votes cast 133 million.  maybe 2% Trump. Although try ill wish people, fingers crossed catches one rallies. Nobody ""makes"" employees go work, go they're paid, they're allowed quit. Lynch's? Lol, fucking morons. People stacked top there.  One parents already dead nothing covid.

Thanks playing. noted recently drop kicked unruly man.... dude bounced Arnold, Arnold thought crowd jostled him.

He's probably shape I've ever seen 70+ year old be. i'd say sorry, details. call local health department. 

sounds fishy [They sure confident] day connected single coronavirus case someone opening package mail groceries (not say happened,they able prove it). number cases area remain high, continue disinfecting. cases low (5 less active) likely going get box cookies grocery shelf package mail. wash hands put groceries away wash hands open packages...the virus needs PERFECT environment survive surfaces homes/outside/cars etc dont environment need. I'll back... policy changes. Along “Texas, Arizona, Florida plans curb lifestyle” Arizona, ICU 80% capacity covid. One nurses know said entire hospital used 90% covid patients.

It’s testing.

Example news hundreds partying bars top off, governor made illegal individual cities laws require masks. reopened full month ahead health advisors said do. doesn’t look scary. 

Measles killed 140,000 globally last year, instance April 12, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt (who begun fourth term office) collapsed died result cerebral hemorrhage. Trump next die office? That's weight gain. want heart problems. day connected single coronavirus case someone opening package mail groceries (not say happened,they able prove it). number cases area remain high, continue disinfecting. cases low (5 less active) likely going get box cookies grocery shelf package mail. wash hands put groceries away wash hands open packages...the virus needs PERFECT environment survive surfaces homes/outside/cars etc dont environment need. least Cheney pretty transparent lust power desire run world according neoconservative viewpoint. didn’t really try hide behind inane, medieval-grade religious bullshit. Maybe volunteer parents? honestly think people like don’t good relationships family members, responsible people capacity, simply won’t understand telling 400 million people die get haircut makes look like giant piece shit.

And, like, people know Facebook whatever know don’t care whether live die. Hopefully karma bite dicks. However, maybe enough people get sick class action lawsuit since unnecessary people come in. Hope stay well tho. Good luck! Bunch bullshit dad keeps *begging* come visit; ""Flights cheap, now's time!"". event want within mile airport, let alone plane, one headed *Florida* places. maybe ones gaslit makes coronavirus third largest death toll US History behind 1918 pandemic WW2.

Also 55,000 WW1 deaths due combat due Spanish Flu. see mentioned time wishing cast doubt seriousness pandemic.

i understand arriving number. 2.2 million confirmed cases. 118,740 deaths. 5.4 percent. 

the world 8,034,461 confirmed cases 436,899 fatalities. 5.4 percent. 

what missing here? pretty sure achieve success first wave second wave. Trump Administration's inaction guarantees second wave - truly massive mega fuck first wave last longer first wave second wave combined. Oh, wow, could see ""Make America Great Again"" masks wear every time appear TV. definitely miss opportunity. We're still first wave. Lol imagine stupid enough believe god. can’t even pretend. odd see people masks hoodlum rob bank. However, I've noticed trend US towards selfishness/self absorption. Entitled self seekers. People caring actions effect others. Impatient things way. say dramatic increase narcissistic personality America. believe make lot sense. % right we've roughly 40 million infections US, would much higher serology would indicate. 

also, adjusting age, overall health quality medical care, one would expect WORLD health organization different number CDC, focused US. Sounds like you’re justifying adventure non sever symptoms. 

As health care worker, could passed vulnerable people may exhibited symptoms. various participants could’ve passed along family members, coworkers, someone grocery store. 

But hey, got night bar. like entitled do. really fell Democratic Governors, think pressured reopening, sooner would like to. Probally afraid lockdown backclash. simply assuming every single person world get infected? heard before. People avoiding fresh produce. Wash veg, bruh. you’re golden. Fuck pious, them. Tourists coming snowbirds Florida,are way back North. Lol interesting. fox friends wear masks? know would never watch seems get direction them. popularity TV ratings. beginning understand risk regardless age. Death risk. lol like many inorganic accounts reddit posting histories line inorganic accounts? Yeah, trusting all. Lettuce
Boycott! Swedish numbers heavily backlogged. Approximately 90%. relevant comparison cannot really made another two weeks so. understand hard know first, kind makes comment misleading. deaths happen them, care. Pretty simple.

It's *""I got mine""* attitude existed USA long time. affects someone know, exist bbqs on, speak. Jackson go high enough food-chain influence. folks going mask 45 Pepé frog does. Refresh Luke 15:3-7 Mathew 18:12-24. 

It’s have. Live want come Exactly - would taken behaving \*slightly\* presidential man seen \*really stepping up\*. Instead blabbered ratings postured shamed people taking basic precautions deadly pandemic. incompetence boggles mind. 

To clear, I'm glad anything lessen chances another term him. even I'm astounded depth incompetence displayed.  neighbor who's lived next door since moved driving car Florida plates right now... explaining difference somebody chooses considerate, somebody chooses massive dick due minor minor discomfort.

To people like wear mask, massive dick inconsiderate. 

Again may minor discomfort you, mean major discomfort don’t give nonsense excuse it’s major discomfort. It’s mild annoyance best, grown deal it.

Yes mild annoyance you, acknowledge everyone different. think everyone fell like ? you’re different leech takes takes suits you, decides give nothing back fake excuse uncomfortable 15 gram piece cloth is.

I may may prefer wear mask force people wear mask want it, respect choice.

Bizarre overreacted blow proportion. Go it, hope place ICU They're literally political beliefs advocate same. Moving higher level generality typical defense move people. Ah, last disney probably around daughter's age. Honestly leave much impression, maybe better now. Busch Gardens remember. Also camping near outer banks North Carolina.

A good compromise might trip SW. Parks like Disneyland Anaheim, drive many natural wonders like Grand Canyon there. course over. know everyone forgets New Orleans/Louisiana. fastest decline cases country.

Now we've opened Phase Monday, Phase 2. second wave. wish gym rules masks such. There’s disinfectant entry PSA posters guidelines nobody except lunatic looking motherfucker wears mask.

Make 47k dead Mr King. bout returning 10 million father stole, way ceremony. won't, Trump problem.  present issues mostly began end World War II, changes made US enable us win war left us much corporate influence government military.  Companies never gave power gained war, that's continued feed direction country takes ever since. need one leopards Congratulation Sweden. one step closer herd immunity.
Their death could avoided. west village one desirable expensive places live NYC, I’m surprised.

Hint, grad students rich mean still works almost every day. Living proof working every day leads long life health opposes everything could potentially save ass come November. Good riddance orange piece shit. ""Arnold's exit meant political stance.""


What shame needs clarified. We're middle global pandemic taking small step protect others seen political. :\_\_( Dr. Gupta CNN literally said opposite this. fraud. Yes. invited person home live there. Also, wearing mask nose sticking like wearing condom tip cut off. Even without spitting incident, risk. 

Why wouldn’t y’all clean yourselves? Ventilate area wipe everything down. What’s done done point. Given many older people dying right now, plenty homes coming available year. find **factually** wrong comment

My comments regards emotion behind words. really 'woe us' tried. Begging people avoid Americans... sake?? lmao. guys radioactive? Guess what, worse outbreaks Russia, Brazil Euro countries per capita, let's even discuss china, might get banned.

Maybe absolute numbers throw guys off, population much larger countries fair comparison.

Get rid defeatist attitued eh, seriously. prevail.  personal conspiracy theory : got vaccinated one vaccines. I'm thinking Oxford one, since started phase III clinical trials, 10'000 doses given healthy patients UK. I'm impression Arkansas becoming less ""Southern"" now?

Am incorrect? Exactly..   Studies shown even hardest hit areas, 65, risk dying covid driving September/October Hmm wonder way it’s written doesn’t even make clear whether doctor saying patients getting younger he’s always seen “plenty” young patients Captain Obvious here. confirm. think really depends area.

Fun fact 2: know supposed episode apple tree apple fall head caused think issue came theory gravity? supposedly happened Great Plague London 1665, Newton stuck home social distancing. Yeah, month fed support UI ends demand still cratered half south overrun hospitals going get real ugly. fuck That's true. It'd cool see study kind ventilation systems exists areas superspreader events. Like town Westchester county spots north Jersey OP’s defence. 4.3 million using subway everyday. That’s 4 times population Stockholm. civil unrest incoming. Yes, Werlabs private actor conducted study. Karolinska universitetslaboratoriet owned run Stockholm county. Actually Arizona 2300 plus new cases Well ableist... ashamed problems never over. think positive rate totally fair number since targeted testing vs general population testing. tested people lived worked close proximity people tested positive before.

Still. good. want see protective measures working better that... want government lie you? hope vote election. Americans need people like you. Ah thank you. Biomedical Research Engineer here. tactical equivalent announcing terrorists found building months hostage situation without determining whether they’re alive plotting phase II air ducts walls SWAT cleanup crew forgot dead body elevator shaft. one scenario, that’s horrifying, other, that’s weird.

Stockholm density still less half NYC: 4800 vs 10000. countless threads people respecting distancing wearing masks US. Again, NYC failed detect outbreak rules put place happened countries.

I find weird. want make comparison lockdown choose area entered lockdown late. gives better comparison stockholm. easy, reason religion sticks around adult. 

You get told going outside kill you, go outside nothing happens ( anecdotal evidence), subconscious brain learns dead going outside, can't comprehend high level thinking like time, statistics even basic science. 

Her autopilot says fine go outside, died last times. Thinking stops ( never really started anyway people). 

Same reason religion sticks, lived whole life ( therefore died) must good/correct. 

There massive disconnect conscious thinking subconscious primal reactions people. one worried disease 0.26% IFR tons false positives. That’s I’m leaving Reddit

Ok I’m back Lol think Denmark near zero deaths per day massive backlog deaths can’t get to? Please People die time dude.

But site OP link needs fix article thats case thats huge discrepancy report. Clever- yes can! started decided train contact tracer could something semi useful. One best parts information public policy, greater good, preserving autonomy individuals possible balance others. 

Practically speaking, plastic visor would impossible provide everyone. reasonably obtainable. decent cloth mask (think tightly woven cotton high thread count sheets even surgical masks) much available, could reduce spread covid one (out R0 2-3) enough create positive impact toward slowing/ending cluster. mask makes something like visor less necessary public. preserves quite bit autonomy protecting community readily available.

Everyone knew enough, everyone made choice. cost saving real people would impossible bear produce zero return. Bullshit March, April, May June... Less 4 months surpassing milestones. eye-opener anyone thinking ""returning normal"". alternative 3k+ deaths per day (which reached *during shutdown*), increasing exponentially. opened up, would literally reach 10k+ deaths day, hospitals would overwhelmed, even would die every illness stopped covid. people able get treatment also die.

There magical solution this, opening completely definitely *not* one. get that, it’s legitimate concern. I’m pointing it’s scientific term political one. Yep. bodies might memory cells fighting future infections instead. think number total infected probably much higher currently based serological surveys.

I see seasonal dropoff, since we're going wrong way behaviors. Best case US - 400,000 dead year. Worst case, millions ""first wave"" keeps building continue lick insides other's nostrils bars restaurants political rallies. Portland empty June pretty uncommon, it’s exactly bustling normally. Where’s scamdemic now? 🤷🏻‍♂️ USAs GDP 50% higher next highest country. 10th GDP per capita behind 9 countries less 10 million people. say arent one greatest inaccurate. Downvote want USA hate control here. Hi, NYC - test positive? City Councilmen businessmen. want businesses open. hell workers, long get caught video actually saying so.  want citizens spending money bars restaurants. 

Go around council. Doctors go TV.  City Councilmen get sick, family members get sick. Hospitals fill up. Reporters visit businesses owned council members.  reported TV. God. Humans hard understand. Really. Human behavior. Inexplicable. doesn’t look like it’s dropped Utah. anything, rent still going up. Housing prices still steadily rising property values. Minimum wage SF $15 hour, pay room outskirts bay. They’re talking directly inside city, expensive part Bay Area. can’t take hashtag seriously. laugh every time see it. keep telling people.

Your exactly right response US frustrating. virus proven multiple countries even US put significant strain healthcare systems. Yet, half country still seems think pandemic sort conspiracy. divided managed politicize public health issue. Prevalence mask wearing seems divided right party lines. makes sense whatsoever. Basically lot really fucking stupid people here.

Everyone go back normal then. That's theory, people come sorts excuses special need follow rules. Narcissism kills.  businesses lost 73% revenue Upper East Side New York, compared 14% East Bronx; 

My take given non-essential businesses closed last two weeks, small businesses Bronx essential like food sellers pharmacies. 

On East Side, small businesses might tend clothes shops, makeup, hair, toys, etc well essential businesses. 

Otherwise dont understand nonessential small businesses closed Governor Mayor, regardless location city. 

It could also people left upper east side droves. people coming back new tenants moving in. able negotiate rent $250 month. Things weird people. I’ll take it, $1500 room / welcome bermuda People posting salaries post rent give everyone reference. Paying $2400 month making $100k bad. paying $550 month make $30k rough.

Assuming 25% tax brackets (for easy numbers)

$100k = $75k, rent walking away $46,200 ($3,850/month) annual living expenses.

$30k = $22,500, rent walking away $15,900 ($1,325/month)

Hell even $60k good deal. $60k = $45k, rent walking $38,400. ($3,200/month)

the rough break even would around $70k musk fan listen says
. Transportation definitely cheaper without car, entertainment expensive. Yes, spend Friday walking Manhattan buy anything entertained people sights. want anything, like see movie, it'll much expensive. cocktail NYC $15 guessing case Midwest/otherwise.

But yeah sometimes feel like balance out? Though feel buying home much expensive suburbs right outside major cities (SF, NY, Boston) whereas probably cheaper smaller cities. think Bay Area techcommuters going relocate San Diego. Slightly cheaper Bay Area 45 min flight away office Nevada fucking gorgeous. Get city breathe fresh air.  coal confirm - also i’m NYC - also saw many young millennial/gen z friends move back home Yeah heard unlimited QE cures virus . . .

Currently, Ive following stay home orders havent traveling keep fam safe. going essentials every 2 weeks so

But normal times usually use public restrooms work, stores, etc shot down? Probably. let's make mistake: past time make wannabe patriots uncomfortable interest public health. racism that's almost sure follow another black mark among thousands state. Oddly Boston usually 70+ wearing masks here, ratio people wearing masks extremely high here. Bingo! travel NYC working TaskRabbit. know city like back hand. That’s say move one three C’s. Ohio actually rocks. it’s sexy city lot offer. rural parts, however.... No, false positives would true original number.

You clearly understand math. position, respecting Ive seen, make call. Masks scarce. frighten people including essential workers, still quite bit unknown, couldnt even due said scarcity. mean position thats almost understandable area gets paved strip malls, fast food, parking lots. urban spawl hell thing. easily throw advantage window stop giving fuck. Disclaimer: US YMMV. I've never seen many new listings advertised social media country. Portugal btw. They're clearly desperate sponsored ads nobody's buying. what's funny they're dropping prices. always look post comments laugh. many people saying: i'll buy drop 50%. Serves right. curious: how? 

Even Sweden's FHM still saying used determine immune yet, recently. God damn, freakishly point. way like Fucked word comes mind.


Can get vaccine shit please? Meds? 

Its 5 months got dick Username checks cumulative deaths

So Norway declining cumulative deaths per capita?

But how!  

I believe either discovered miracle completely misinterpreting graph. r/oddlyspecific Fuck you, I’m coming even harder Yes. Covid 19 may may anything went 10 mile bike ride Boston suburbs saw 2 people without masks, maybe 500-600 people seen.

So politicians worried career serving public, sounds like business usual. key actual hard soft skills keep employable. Good companies start outsourcing bad companies keep outsourcing. $35k year $750 month rent, assuming state income tax, less $1,000 savings month. save double month consider middle income SF.

Also find cheaper places big cities. pay $950 month share rent I'm SF proper. raise rent $10/year.m right tenant. It’s important right person make bigger profit. I’d say it’ll newsworthy don’t set daily records point. sweet deal rent $900 month live three people, one niece fucking time. hate it. specifically talking earnings tech industry Bay area

90k would quite low total compensation many roles (a non-technical entry level ones) many bay area tech companies, someone lower likely balanced equity degree

Obviously plenty people tech Bay area earn &lt;90k children? Numbers go people still it. think that's first time I've ever called something right. tin foil hat fire early masks recommended. made sense. Well yeah places blowing upnin cases first wave yeah....... 16% capacity remaining exactly comfortable buffer numbers clearly slow things getting worse. ""We enough beds"", ghoulish is, still works **actually enough beds** going enforce it? backwards. mitigation scenario, every restaurant going sales year go business. assuming month lockdown followed reopening suppression way worse year nobody money going restaurants.

It's entirely possible service industry go business regardless do. you, like seemingly everyone else wants criticize lockdowns without thinking things through, comparing lockdown business-as-usual. opportunity business-as-usual went window decided January try contain border.

Also, understand relevance Cuomo refusing say came idea Order. end day, signed it, buck stops - admitted many times. really sure getting here?

Edit: also worth noting [NYs care home death rates similar found Italy, Spain, France, Germany likely little Cuomo's EO.    Smart person!  What's game choice lately? Eh shit news keeps getting worse every day....its like lied Looks like good news got posted look mortgage payments haven’t changed much given interest rates. 

It’s especially amazing consider we’ve added 100+ million people time, entire population Canada Italy combined (or two Spain’s, slightly less entire population Japan Mexico, entire population Germany).  think gonna happen unless there's urban exodus. Literally everyone know afford house bought one yet spent last 5 years ""waiting dip"". people scrambling buy 10% dip guarantees 30% dip like 2007. Fuck Greg Abbot wheelchair rode on. really understand difference deaths cause contagious virus deaths auto accidents? Comparing two is.....retarded. Instead blaming media, would blame people like try pretend global pandemic thats killed 100K+ people USA alone big deal. Car accidents? Really? Absolutely pathetic take.

TX excess deaths aren’t accounted for, exceptional % compared states. guess lower mortality rate may due face tsunami cases right shutting like early hard hit states did, knows. Foodstamps aren’t practical use online, sometimes even store pickup, convoluted mess. Another way “indiscriminate” virus dangerous us poors ! Nobody seems ever grasp hospital bill required billed maximum charges according Chargemaster. properly billed Insurance.

If initially bill reduced rate, insurers could state it’s true billing rate force cost.

Is good system? it’s trash, it’s good thing all.

However, clickbait needs stop lot bills see negotiated prices insurance payout prices FAR less.

For singular anecdotal example. surgery billed $130,000. Insurance covered $74,000, hospital absorbed $52,000 cost. end payment requirement $3500.

We haven’t done shit! think Beaverton anyway similar Portland, need research better. Portland metro far insular local area place I've ever seen. Yeah apples oranges comparison. anything, we're greater frequency pandemics modern age throughout recorded history, globalized connected modern world gotten, despite advances medical science.

And like said, downplay pandemic, US casualties WWI, anything really. detracts point. U.S., world, could seen coming, didn't, especially U.S. disinformation campaign, incompetence leaders, finger pointing posturing making issue far worse needs be. point comparing Texas.

Everyone Texas Governor one first States open. 

As others stated, population density seems big factor typical ""*we must flatten curve first*"" statement. Love That’s insane. Long Island NY cant find studio 1600. utilities extras included. usual, shit rolls downhill NY room rental around 1k that's outside city Ya tend agree take. sick February (in Canada) almost impossible get anyone even accept idea could COVID. reporting single digit cases country testing cough, shortness breath, China Iran. clearly lot community spread throughout North America time, idea could get test actually confirmed positive without traveled internationally ridiculous. like 6 test kits available per state February.

Pandemics cost big, matter do, nature beast. Unfortunately NZ media susceptible manipulation vested interests sorts lies misleading information published so-called evils lock down, crazy stuff actually gullible believing lockdown would kill people pandemic (all-cause mortality tends drop community locked down, obvious reasons). even apparent 'scientist' claiming job loss would cause rocketing PTSD - impossible, can't get PTSD lock down, definition. Public health crises extremely, eye-wateringly expensive money drain lasts decades, plus there's morbidity contend with, likely given physical damage virus does. translates billions dollars decades come. There's also demographics take account, sobering terms added impact pandemic country. Sure, bet, good one, highly likely effective treatments found vaccine developed. economy 'suffering terribly' date certainly countries everything taken account. run several businesses they're fine pause. I'm thankful NZ Govt actually maths, looked evidence including good quality historical analyses, and, critically, balls say lobbyists. Someone please tell landlord 😂🤣 use property manager directly deal tenants schedule repairs yourself? disagree. think logical self-protection seal lesser infected areas greater infection burdens. internal (like finland sealed Uusimaa) international (how every Nordic region borders closed Sweden). populism, common sense. countries closed borders China start maybe damn mess first place. disease unstoppable many thought back start pity done stem spread. 

As Skåne harder hit regional solution make sense: Skåne also recently came said variant 'we're gonna kick virus' ass' hopefully get better control soon. 

As Q&amp;A anyone ask questions knows represent broad public opinion skewed way. Mmost peole know Denmark REALLY want borders open angry Swedes bucking Nordic consensus. samarbedje broken down, yes, that's one brother thought going Special put siblings jeopardy risky, harmful strategy. completely untrue.  could probably debated whether exemption exist given current circumstances. Risking hundreds even thousands lives grieving couple say goodbyes seem rational me.

Disneyland rented corporations prior 1992, first time individual rented personal non celeb could pay enough it. Hahahahahahahaha Tell employee never come back. Find someone else cover shift. shut tell one. Would unsurprising response situation restaurant business. bottom 75% suddenly increased income overnight, wouldnt make 75th percentile suddenly poor. 

Also, huge difference median mean incomes America. first 4 paragraphs article literally New York

In relatively uninformed opinion issue specific city, type housing looking for. person article got deal rent looking luxury buildings area highly desirable non-COVID times. got benefit far less people looking apartments price point, West Village isn’t nearly desirable barely take advantage city. Suddenly proximity work, bars, restaurants basically irrelevant, pricing reflect Buying house West Village cost far 5k/mo. turns out, different people different wants needs want compare flu something? Ditto Northwest. Rent prices control Oregon.

And process going ads finding one scam incredibly frustrating. 

This modern class way played out. Many people can't see forest trees. that's whole lotta masks I'm seeing web design awful? Funny sub pick click bait headline pretend ""swedens strategy"" goes different headline, Swedens fault... like 19/20 wearing masks. least public. Even store today another guy line said believe virus, wearing mask still complying asked stand back line floor marking. assume that?
After first infection: even donated plasma testing positive antibodies. Honestly, think Texas going hot mess schools won’t opening fall. schools might though. They’ve talked “Covid positive” dorm people stay they’re quarantining. sounds terrible.  Correct begun return normal used masks center strategy. Masks simplest effective measure use mitigate spread vaccine available. God. live New Jersey. I'm jealous everyone else paying rent/mortgage. expensive here. Yeah, understand part it. wife going nuts. She’s isolated house isn’t allowed go anywhere (autoimmune Deficiency) man, people could take extra steps would quicker. one considers diabetes epidemic, kills 80k per year. Many times heart disease. get there's disconnect ""infectious"" systemic policy cultural factors contribute things. could even sold them,... something ANYTHING! attacking specifically, made think this: everyone assume herd immunity magical number virus disappears? 57% people antibodies huge problem, reach 60% huzzah done! idea people get recover, less people spread it. virus spreads exponentially, recedes exponentially. Lockdowns, masks, distancing, serve flatten curve. hospital capacity problem, we're dragging out. show calculations? trying figure got different number you. 

My assumptions:

\- 7580 people age 15-54 died coronavirus fatality driving 1.22 deaths / 100 million vehicle miles population US age 15-54 172 million chance dying coronavirus 7580/172e6 = 4.4e-5

X miles \* 1.22 deaths / 100 million miles = 4.4e-5, solve X

I get 3606 miles. 

Sanity check: 172e6 people drives 3606 miles \* 1.22 deaths / 100e6 miles = 7566 deaths, equal number started with. Again, everyone agrees cause virus spread. That's really even question. protesters putting others risk. There's plenty difference ""I'm spreading virus right police need stop beating murdering people"" ""I'm spreading virus right want job back"", least one things chance actually effective. 

It's beyond stupid protest virus (which prevents getting job back) spreading virus prolonging amount time takes get virus control people go back work safely. virus cannot convinced go away protesting. Governments however convinced hold police accountable crimes abuses. 

*Everyone* wants lives go back normal. many people stupid protests police even biggest thing holding recovery back. Protests something avoiding pandemic, partly tragic they've take place. LA supply *extremely* constrained. I'm looking getting couple hits week Zillow filters. area ten million people. Sweden: Hold Corona-beer... see masks bar would work unless chugging drink waiting getting another one.

if guzzling keep moving mask sips handling time best practices. would interesting compare countries losses war too. course likely bigger roles wars.

Maybe US hit half million end year. Assuming exponential spread. major stretch, given viruses tend spread quickly start (among vulnerable, mobile) - stretch predicted 15x number deaths currently seen Sweden. rent typically going up? much? C Agreed points. think things change fall winter, hang then. always seem worst success needing sell buyers markets needing buy sellers markets. 

There ate still fair deals, least state, want put sweat equity fixer, know that's everyone's thing. banks really tightened lending requirements COVID. Took three months! Got email today I'm paid finally!!! pay $1009/mo 775 sqft miles outside Philadelphia. I've actually discounted $889 monthly rent paying time crisis. There's subs covering covid nobody forcing sub here. many young middle aged people scarred lungs life?

Capacity issues may contributed elective surgeries

From article.

Houston-area health officials say plenty room hospitals, whole. However, say individual hospitals overwhelmed.

""Yesterday morning 9 a.m., four hospitals saying saturated already, 9 o’clock morning Monday, usually see summertime,"" Dr. David Persse, Houston Public Health Authority said.

Persse says two things leading this.

""**The governor allows elective surgeries return**, they're ramping again, that’s filling hospitals, time COVID happening, it’s COVID, it’s fact hospitals opening back up,” Persse said.

He's also noticed another disturbing trend – young people getting virus.

""That’s consistent we're seeing we're walking driving around town, it’s younger folks gathering, it’s huge surprise,"" Persse said Lots human life go away piss here. whole disinfectant craze bogus. air room wipe doorknobs common surfaces. looking SGV, South Pas... wish applied suburbs Denver.

I’m fucking pissed. Interesting. wonder never raised price landlords dont make much $. do, that's norm. sure shit would never want one. 

 choice- live business... wow single-issue voter! always works out! certainly strategy, else regulations etc. set place there. I'd suggest read matter bit somehow gotten impression one.

I'm also kind confused stating strategy, literally next line saying herd immunity strategy bullshit.

There strategy not, going make decision there, I'm afraid.

I never asked give example Asian country. think Sweden Korea really comparable. Culture different, geographical situation pop. density.

And mean, yeah. Sweden has, far, failed contain virus. naturally puts country countries failed so. People want Sweden fail. Well, outside trolls possibly lower COLA; DC-area rent $2k-ish/mo nice area great amenities, $24k payment nowhere near DCMA. Like, aren’t even places $120k rougher parts town within 2-hr commute really.

But FL, COLA lower, opposite — could probably also gotten mortgage less rent. (I didn’t want put roots there.)

There also calculators online buying vs renting based COLAs, anyone thinking it. Personally feel upkeep/hidden maintenance costs really insidious parts home ownership lot first-time buyers get blindsided by.  sound like decent landlord. Hope find one like start looking. 

Most people aware costs landlord. run type problem hiring employee. take time explain presence creates cost much greater salary (employer side taxes, health insurance, office space compensation work home resources, equipment, overhead and, importantly building cash reserve keep employed downturns. )

The economics running business eye-opener people employees life.

I wish best luck hope always good tenants. wouldn’t put beneath them. Oh man, I’m sorry hear that. hope everything works out. Thanks response. Keep updated! bit tough much higher since excess deaths going almost within normal levels now. Thank makes sense!   That’s going stop people living normally. people get crazy side effects people underlying health conditions. trying downplay virus, acting like way live permanently changed virus permanently affect people ridiculous. me, that's argument *for* wearing them.

You every right reckless comes personal risks, much endanger others. I’m surprised way Sweden approached this. would expected country known generous welfare state take far comprehensive approach. attribute to? Nope. wwe. probably still use dvcpro Well he's botched deal badly well he's neither got anywhere near top dog wealth absolute power (given many initiatives rejected).

I live abusive family. want nightmare over. funny. forever, sound stupid saying ""Hey I'm going China next week!"" Also good luck locals think kind douche. current death rate PA still like twice California per capita? Overall think like 3.5x. apparent 1.0 transmission rate great, nothing get excited many cases still traced. 

PA like 9th highest deaths per captia among states 5th worst testing rate. perhaps hard hit state implement widespread testing. fine virus get's control again, fucked. Aka vaccine 2-3 times expensive afford it. Middle class gets fucked again. Notwithstanding that, shutting days going eliminate virus location without “deep clean”. virus survive surfaces maybe 1-3 days depending type surface. ""all"" disappear mean stock market gains 100% agree democratic country fine, several others. Nobody backed sure things science,” said senior Trump administration official, asked named, conference call reporters Tuesday. “We cannot promise 100 percent chance success.

Obviously can't promise 100% chance success. new information changes nothing. think US losing 10B/day vaccine worth us.  government footing bill. They're desperate vaccine they're telling manufacturers ramp production now, works, they'll ready go, work, taxpayer cover expense.

Cynicism aside, think that's bad plan. COVID-19 bad enough I'm board drastic steps get people vaccinated soon possible. We're best! still things could done save lives that's happening, like widespread encouragement wearing masks, starting president leading example. point motivation intensive test beginning, everyone thinks meat? Throwing ball catching ball extremely important.  Think it.

They're marketing. sell idea virus nothing.

If wear mask, gives credence idea virus may actually dangerous thing. Everything opened back  Like, safety trials fail billions doses hands?!

You destroy them. promising vaccine candidates manufactured ahead time, even though know may usable.

Given enormity problem facing world, afford spend billion dollars manufacturing vaccines even know usable. get back live? ""But....bu..but masks!!!""

The link use google web translation translate watch Yeah, seriously reaching say that. Denmark basically lag anymore, even peak death toll lag bad (maybe week cases). Denmark problems lag right *start* outbreak hey figured pretty quick. 

They also ever 6% rise excess mortality worst part outbreak, compared Sweden hit least 29% overall: Sweden also quite excess mortality deaths probably attributable COVID, tune least 1,000: Good him. I’m leave office one wears masks hand washing policy lax. Oh yeah, nazism left wing racism exist./s Perhaps surpassed long time ago due deaths weren’t recorded People weren’t inside multiple strangers... looks like cautious Cuomo right go along best public health advice could get experts anid paid off. Even stikingly active co-operation people public health measures beaten virus. hope Governers Association paying attention sucess taking advice public health experts replicated across America. That’s needed feels like separate issue. It’s going stop virus. Even well trained nurses doctors infected that’s proper PPE use. fact CNAs, housekeepers, kitchen, support staff, office staff never going practiced well trained nurses regardless much pay. there’s still issue visitors training even hostile toward precautions. 

And workers lives outside work. Lives aren’t PPE constantly contact people contact others, on. long daily, reliable, rapid effective test way know one picks virus. takes one shedding virus window asymptomatic. 

I don’t like lockdowns far they’re real viable option. Maybe nationwide least city city county county cases develop. Nursing homes take precautions been, it’s unrealistic expect facilities launch effective measures even well funded governments can. Putin extremely careful health. visited hospital full hazmat oxygen supply.

Funny Trump follow idol respect. spend 2-4 hours gym every week years, really living longer? spend time exercising. exercising, extra 8-16 hours every month whatever want. Sure, Jan.  
By taking pensions, maybe. Yeah, Orange County health director driven office, death threats. matter convenience. differences parts world North America too. Places higher number kids per family less burden. Also I've seen dementia happens 3-10 times much North America parts world. family pretty much guaranteed, looking family member dementia enormous toll. Ask Cuomo goons purposely sent sick patients nursing homes. take data suddenly 50k death toll. Sounds like people trying increase death rate selfish purposes. Set edge table walk away. official phone number report type things. beyond irresponsible. comment section 🔥 least he's correct really fighting who! 

(Saying quiet part loud, divide young vs old.) Move on, nothing see (except 5k deaths)... hope all. need tourism He's probably top 10 famous people time.

""*Living*"" might something. Democraic governors least tried bring virus control. Michigan New York State, way better before. southern states hand.... Holy shit. mortgage three bedroom house $500/month. Wow. rented, never paid $600 2 bed 2 bath. 

This makes super angry. understand cost living must high, yet wages proportionate cost living. WOOSH Thank comment! Seeing everyday would make week Houston, meet, 'Bama.

Yes, agree completely. really need start learning actual Greek/Hebrew meanings often! make huge difference clarification. Thanks reply. haha universe ***SO*** big Yet deaths still remain magically low even 2 weeks spikes started. Florida 7 day rolling average deaths impossibly flat many old people live there. like brace doubters go like never pandemic begin with, see NY’s crowded bars last weekend go existence... This, much. Good ol’ Governor Duece responded concerns verifying amount ICU beds ventilators have, rather suggesting even potential another lockdown social distancing regulation.

I understand economy stay afloat considering livelihoods could face ruin, really feels like blatant disregard spike happening state’s concern welfare people. It’s frustrating. Get this, saw least three doctors/nurses/techs gym (they enter scrubs) also without masks. comes calculated risk - virus widely circulated town. gym still offering group classes babysitting, everyone pretty good sanitizing equipment usage. 

I'm trying find work safe masks washed. passing weighted kettle ball squats go ER even bigger risk letting work corner room remains locked occupied trainer. I've asked renewal contract three never asked anything

Hmmm... ;) WHATABOUTISM: Whataboutism, also known whataboutery, variant tu quoque logical fallacy attempts discredit opponent's position charging hypocrisy without directly refuting disproving argument. Whataboutism particularly associated Soviet Russian propaganda.

Logic: Logical fallacy


Tactic: Propaganda technique


Active period: Cold War–present Damn right is. Living SE Asia changed plans. way hell parents going home. We’re making plans move back next decade start caring them. Doubtful. follow lot real estate forums facebook groups. many people actually following guidelines. Whatever takes make sell type attitude. 

People listing. Wish true real estate. Property prices actually gone anything decent selling week less.  Swede, spitting truth 21 states downward trends. get point hospital capacity spare, look re-opening step. 

Lots places US showing reverse spikes, control outbreaks, re-open phases even new case numbers decline. Michigan got slammed hard still top 10 number cases/deaths, almost fully re-opened barely broke 200 new cases Monday Tuesday combined (today yet reported). 

Florida's tougher spot reliant tourism that's industry various elements high risk. strategies different know they'll be, clearly policy shift question if. honest think country like Idiocracy. Coronavirus exposed almost industries run grifters cant formulate single plan things get little dicey. think classifying ""events American life loss"" Coronavirus Wars would considered events. 9/11 list well.  ones watched live-streams of. Lots people taking masks yell louder putting back on. Ok know isn’t haircuts intentionally straw manning. 

And right. lucky alive. disease bears risk. However, world full risks can’t removed entirely want live lives. Take driving example. Motor vehicle deaths still leading Covid-19 deaths world wide year likely still hby end year current projections. isn’t spike like Covid-19. every year pretty much. yet, risks almost us willing assume. “essential” tasks, like going grocery store, also deem risks acceptable pleasure, like traveling vacation. thing driving, like Covid-19, isn’t put risk. put pedestrians motorists risk well. risk can’t fully control either. matter careful are, still someone heart attack drift lane. get people accept risk. living life also important. isn’t deny risk, downplay it, realize certain things important totally risk free life. 

And isn’t impossible get rid risk driving. could ban driving together. would save 1.5 million people year dying auto accidents, countless form maimed disabled.Why people don’t feel way this?  Visiting dying parent acceptable reason travel days. can’t wave 2 wave 1 never ends... someone late stages getting student visa master's degree, feel pain.

Doesn't help 2 idiots made public sentiment people would responsibly quarantine worse too. work hospital Florida. Elective surgeries banned ordered stay half capacity prepare influx COVID patients. last 3 months profits down.

CEO sick making money. back full capacity since restrictions lifted. available beds. seeing record number cases Florida. scares Could reword English, please? Put piece shit back prison belongs! Well, virus free nz lasted days least.... People coughing repeatedly need stay home, put mask venture out. theories states seeing consistent increases cases easing restrictions? expecting every state eased restrictions start seeing cases climb again, seem happening. definitely contribute doctor's research programs. GI doctor receives $450k per year Janssen (maker Remicade) ""associated research funding"" according openpaymentsdata.cms.gov. reasons legitimate, seems like could abuse this. someone like home gym?  missing point. dude replying saying actual numbers article. There's zero data go of. put ""hospitalized patients getting younger"" headline, would really helpful provide reader numbers rather quick quote doctor used word ""plenty"". Like dude seen 8 younger patients past couple days? 50 younger patients? 73? kind important quantify ""plenty"" going make article's headline. part modern journalism though. Bring headline minimal substance within article itself. island makes much easier. one in, one out, eliminate COVID home, keep “no one in/out” rule long necessary. similar feelings PA going worse trust me, get hopes day day trends. Arizona entering storm, think next NY, place country will. two weeks least virus cools AZ, possibly month. Masks really help seems. NYC went lockdown month started. test, know. Sounds little like Canada going Neighbors South. keeping lid things things states place. states act together others falling short effectively given up.   happy border closed hope closed handle this.

However talk people using ""Alaska exemption"" cross.  obviously Obama’s fault. cupboards bare. 

Trump gave 1/2 trillion dollars rich need patient money trickles down

And honestly pull boot straps like great man did. happened New York able move patients field hospitals hospitals overwhelmed way hospital beds ICU beds per capita sounds like "" got little bit pregnant "" type Right? one wants mention fact massive protests, one seemed wearing masks definitely social distancing. 

The people screaming “shut America down” ones streets shoulder shoulder burning small businesses. Hypocrisy. I'm reminded dinning example spread several months ago. everyone wants reopen; seems everyone ""forgotten"". god truly simpleton. Texas best per capita deaths world certainly US.

I know claims Texas exceptionalism regards protecting elderly. 

But sadly think likely using pneumonia residency requirements hide 20-30 deaths day overall totals. Church bible meaning ""fellowship"" greek word starts ""ecla"" cant remember it. say jesus says ""church"" means group people building itself. Thats says synagogue such. meet small groups, take proper precautions stay away building hes telling you. fair, US burning cities setting autonomous zones. Kind usurps one's attention somewhat. like micro-manage everything. Fauci must reports going different parts government.  disagree ER Chief? telling truth, may may applicable wider scale, data age patients would nice fully believing headlines make generalizations. \[citation needed\] found ground glass opacities lungs asymptomatic Covid carriers, could wrong. believe you, giving random reason came mind. Never believed pertained specifically situation. Well opinion worth crumbs. seen many folks TV commenting black population hit harder white population Covid US.  

Racism could said cause due resulting poverty, crowded living conditions, use public transportation, less access good healthcare, need continue work ""essential"" workers, etc.  

Basically poverty issue pandemic african-americans tend poverty proportionally whites.  Navaho similar situation whatever reason.  

If living bunch people, perhaps multi-generational, small space like apartment small house adult two keep working time likely get infected. Well like still there. mean worried taking precautions Texas little 1000 beds per million inhabitants. New York little 1500. someone lies, people die   wait till home owners start dying off. Grow get back work.  helping insisting masks live Southern California can’t even afford live County work(ed?) in. Trueeeeeeeeeee ain’t neva lie
I already forgot talking covid19 it’s good need things distract us. guys great day! Mortality many nursing homes 60% *In first year*. financial planner part job evaluating recommending different LTC (Long term care plans/products), stats something like 95% time dead five years passed nursing home. mortality US up, much basically 'front loading' due people nursing homes harder-hit something people really considering  Yes. needs reported. we've reduced to? even citing statewide stats, citywide stats?

And everyone knows numbers going up. They're going we're testing, tracking tracing. Keep mind ICU Beds available Covid-19 patients - people without Covid also need ICU treatment already there.

Experience says “not long”. Well, even without full herd immunity eradicate disease, people population immune disease/similar diseases still reduce potential spread (and thus death toll). think that’s poster getting “partial herd immunity.” date give that? Amazing transparent media is. Protest , riots problem die suddenly concerned again. think different way, people followers elected leaders tell elected leaders telling people everything fine people going assume everything fine news told fine, mayor told fine governor told fine. root problem think comes defunding education, make population stupid way question doing. educated population think threat people power. Exactly staying fit, active eating well. Garden, walk, Tai chi, dancing, going gym. Gotta wanna get old. bike path morning yelling people

A mentally ill person. Overreacting sure. I'm saying impossible likely bigger exchange that. Indeed, absolutely terrible lets certain groups create false narrative. Yep lease ended bought house May. landlord listed place 250 paying. northern VA workers working remote, likelihood earlier return since many people living area support government clients they’re stuck face-to-face preference working.

Also know fact like 7 offers place since landlord kept asking ok show house (and got showing landlord paid $100 application).

This like fire exit explicitly constructed.

Read Manafort indictments. lays insanely EASY launder money $1M.

Basically, get $1M outside US buy house.

Go person selling house say $900k.. . Offer $100k selling price take cash ask questions.

They LITERALLY give title house.

Then go bank say title want loan secured house.

They give loan... laundered money.

And reference, here’s another article side crazy seeing political motivations. saying can’t dig find contrary examples, articles published less 24 hours apart.

Wake “Natural immunity” buzzword created anti-vaxxers. There’s thing. 

You develop immunity something exposed (or something looks similar enough immune system can’t tell difference). you’ve never exposed it, immune it. negotiated, agreed :/ Yeah. almost think that's better though since cheerleaders lost credibility lately. thought would grabbed attention people understand seeming skepticism gives pause. We'll see new data released effective company makes saying. That's real 'view' have. source? Makes sense. job makes WFH permanent, I'll find plot land Midwest build hut there! :D read herd immunity 70% bench mark computer modeling data point used infectious diseases. take anything actual disease consideration. assumes everyone level susceptibility, infectiousness, exact social behaviors. Recent research show case.

Using variable data, statisticians placed level something akin herd immunity ( phrase like herd immunology biological fact effects herd immunity two entirely separate things) could effect transmission levels low 20-40%.

Best practices would assume somewhere middle realize know enough say definitively either way. taught school Civil War fought 1 reason:

The southern states wanted weak centralized government give power make whatever laws want northern states wanted alternative.

A modern example result perspective federal drinking age raised 21. Instead age summarily raised 21 funding tied States individually. Prior Civil War south wanted basically federal laws done way instead universal mandate. Even today government structured make awkward laws tying desired result agreed upon central government function (ACA tax another example).

The result war North ""won"" South agreed law changes North also compromised considerably leaving us inefficiencies today.


It mentioned right slaves primary law southern states wanted.

My main point starve economy perpetually. end sight virus, best minimize damage allowing people make ends meet.  renewing lease eviction. tenants numerous noise complaints denied renewal. yes guess make easier ""evict"" someone necessarily correct terminology. 

If understand case, landlords failed renew lease provide safe housing renovation. well within right can't provide alternative unit, I'd even go far see legally obligated renew lease can't provide safe housing. I’m sure would sell necessity could longer afford mortgage, face foreclosure/eviction. think mean rents going be. recently renew. tried raising rent $60/month.

I asked nicely could reconsider lower amount given world's circumstances. came back raising $30/month. signed. Since want move.


Then month later, got notice city/state made apartment complexes unable raise rent renewals. paid back increase last couple months locked last years rent while(not sure long city/state mandated this).


While sounds like good news now, worry next year raise rent even try 'back fill' reduced/locked price time. reluctant rent earn enough - affordable rent long 1/4 monthly salary tilted (especially metropolitan areas like Zurich, Geneva Lausanne) 1/3 income considered “normal” - however also rental companies tell flat-out earn “too much” flat (happened once, offered expensive one instead... declined thou) live hours north city pretty rural area. housing market skyrocketed. I’m happy got house did. may end priced keeps up. Food prices rising exactly what’s needed now... “ ...so hopefully curb it.” councilman (Brantley Lyons), also lawyer, saying things like wearing mask “violating constitutional rights.” ordinance voted 5 4 Obama coronavirus animal vaccines. We've never one humans we've never needed one. SARS contained got anywhere near point, MERS technically still exists, spread efficiently humans unlikely cause true pandemic. me?  Rents increasing metropolitan areas every year? That’s close enough apology me; I’ll take it. Deaths lag infections two weeks. seen overall increase new cases past week. Rest assured decreasing death toll (which result northeast Michigan/Louisiana improving) start swing direction. really, still know people died, gets reported different day. look adjusted graphs, decline clear. 

 

""Avlidna/dag"" understood mean diagnosed based symptoms. February, could get test anywhere US unless recent travel history China Europe. Maybe using diagnosed tested positive interchangeably, maybe travelled weird mention article.

One key overlooked point cut transmission rate, far fewer cases would've meant overwhelmed hospitals enabled far healthcare workers focus victim. long term, still adds supply side equation. supply begins outpace demand, luxury units longer profitable make affordable developments start built.

The masks help tremendously everyone wearing correctly. global warming gigantic threat

indeed. counterpoint moving. clear, Moderate Party Ulf Kristersson opposition speaking decision. cut quote awkward Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson says seeing government's proposal directive think completely unreasonable. goes without saying must come election. go year year half. tsunami commission managed year, excluded land Ulf Kristersson. go home give parents big fat kiss. renting 12 years 4 different apartments always rent go up. I'm almost scrambling buy home deal arbitrary rent increases. hate much. I've gone renting 20% income 35% literally existing. That's kinda irrelevant. point there's clear trend data: higher income, larger spending cut. Whatever threshold ""the rich"" is, they've probably cut spending people lower income groups. Ok, so, again, exponential growth halted. mean, id believe started w pentagon. I'm surprised survey results predictive facility outcomes. That's interesting. also appreciate link calls regulators necessary sufficient, hope pushes power act collaboratively crisis punitively (which I've seen date). too. fact invested home gym I'm rich old. 

But sounds like part routine maybe deal them. opinion pieces, studies stanford researchers :)

i can't bothered wade 20 links find one citing. Dunno live that's what's happening Idaho really sucks us residents much equity. Paid 310k house, years ago would've like 200.  Bc impact would cost/prices services, goods even housing, yeah probably would. Remember Wuhan first locked down, redditors saying: Could never happen New York... Counterpoint: many pandemics US even had? They're fairly rare Black Swan event. wrongfully acting like pandemics common events. They're not.


The US also exceptionally lucky wars. We've nowhere near casualty lists Asian European nations. 


Another point runaway epidemic. exceptional event modern world outside unlucky Africa. Almost diseases kill far fewer folks, particularly modern age. mean would nice (China) little transparent initial outbreak. 

That said control. [Tuskegee syphilis ended 48 years ago 1972. exactly distant past unlikely types unethical treatments would occur again, impossible. bit conspiratorial part? think interesting think people taking covid seriously following false narrative narrative presenting seems fairly far fetched me. Exactly. Even ignoring Asia, clear elderly dying huge numbers hit Italy. One earliest outbreaks nursing home WA.

The lack targeted nursing home interventions many states shameful. Florida top NY ffs. Maybe user name. :-) landlord put everybody who's lease expire month-to-month existing rates without explaining why. called office it, said actually due large increase $150 per month due ""hot market"" landlord, kindness heart, want slam us increase hard times.

The office said wanted renew immediately, rent would go $75/month would ""doing landlord real favor"".??? (Our rent increased yearly $100/month past 4 years.) obviously said yes, let's that.

Landlords gonna landlord. Can't wait hopefully buy house next year. Tired renting. NYC fine thank you. I'd far worried states continue deny problem Eh, three weeks. makes sense wait bit longer sure, looking good. assumes immunity virus outside getting virus recovering. Recent studies showing previous infections Coronaviruses (common colds) confer protection. residents back dying parent photo op? scary dumb people working healthcare are. understanding infections proper safety procedures. Yet seen women nursing scrubs following safety precautions. incredible fear instilled non logical thinking.

Isolating people healthy necessary. Social isolation proven deadly heart disease.

Everyone experiences daily lives hundreds exposures pathogens deemed cause infections. using washroom, grocery shopping, using phone etc


""""Even hand-washing isn’t obvious solution seems.  A much-quoted study American Journal Infection Control reported that anesthesiologists nurse anesthetists poorly compliant with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines hand hygiene (HH).  However, full compliance guidelines impossible.  An average 149 “HH opportunities” identified observers hour anesthesia care.""

149 Hand washing opportunities hour 149 opportunities cause infection.

While Im advocate reasonable avoiding social situations ill, need take opportunity start taking better care health overall point means none would physically distancing anymore.

Its far better going bar, fool thinking that's still safe small home parties. friends probably also small groups ""safe, small home parties"" with.  wife closing 3 bedroom 2.5 bath house $208k north Charlotte. Places going fast, though. Every place looked market within days. 1400 700 SF right Atlanta, relatively low COL city size. protests pretty adamant masks. Even going far water, hand sanitizer masks give people attending. Still early tell people smart quality often found gop “leaders” I'm suburbia Cal, see prices like that. Might well move NYC cool. yeah it’s unrealistic expect shut entire season cases. they’re safer bubble real world, it’s almost beneficial Question though - salaries adjusted accordingly? Part reason SF workers paid much cost living. drops longer relevant people arent living there, company ability attract talent much broader scope locations, doubt pay remain is. may stay already there, would expect drop salary offers new hires. end day people better off/saving money net same? hearing church friends live fear God handled. believe government. 

It’s pretty depressing careful living fear. MD eventually tested nursing home staff mid april  seen news story today Dallas woman re-tested positive 4 months? nightmare level stuff story way firsthand info obscure stuff Korea earlier.

I guess Dallas woman sick clear obvious symptoms February, tested positive.  recovered even donated plasma. Now, 4 months later, 4 months recovered symptom free, back hospital due headache high blood pressure tested positive virus again.

I don’t like posting links Google find multiple articles “Dallas woman coronavirus.” town! probably asymptomatic cases symptomatic, scary asymptomatic case dont know infected unless tested. know infected came contact someone infected, still going normal lives, social gatherings, say like joining Trumps shitty rally, walking time bombs spread virus. cause butterfly effect spread symptomatic cases rise hell breaks loose. describing self fulfilling prophecy  would expect double number silent speaking it. knows? US charge? Certainly mistake, I'm sure look us USA UK call going New Zealand ""shitshow"". 

I wish shitshow. Silver Edge has disclaimer bottom site reads “Products distributed Silver Edge intended diagnose, treat, cure prevent disease.”

So one study 2009. Anything since then? Anything shows organizations conducted study see results line Trump. Get now. send thoughts prayers there, vanish like miracle. think risk dying car crash higher percentage death corona virus. something called wall street us money printing body gets first. :( White House unhappy taking long get herd immunity. disagree much government's strategy really mistaken. 

The curve flattened long ago. stopping exponential spread, stabilising number new infections day. happened long ago, since number ICU places occupied declined.

Then main strategy making sure hospitals we're overwhelmed limiting spread. successful. 

Reaching herd immunity strategy, knew little might happen. Still, know relatively little. 

However, they've openly saying examining possibility reach herd immunity. Again, strategy. strategy making sure hospitals overwhelmed. 

Source: I've watched read summaries almost every daily briefing since march. family 18. turn 18 move out. Mostly 18 year old deciding moving, parents pressuring anything. fact, daughter decided move out, tried get stay (she wanted go boyfriend. turned good, safe better boyfriend now). That's true ok.


Edit: we've 1000 deaths per day time we'd well short 200,000 end July ""at rate."" Even deaths/day increased 1000 we'd well short. projection projects less 150,000 end July. trust IHME dude reads fear mongering articles reddit. define dumping? many countries solely depend imported goods vast part consumption. example Mexico's agriculture destroyed US agriculture industry. well defined term internationally. aren’t going change them. Don’t bother Consider lucky. rent gone order $150-$200/month last several years. year first offered renewal increase. 365,000+ Union soldiers 290,000+ Confederate soldiers died. 1 5 soldiers fought Civil War died. 2.5% US population time.

WW2 407,000+ deaths, 0.3% US population.

Neither numbers count injuries. responsible need blame, react unified whole instead trying isolate...it work facilities incorporate ages operations.

Well look hospitals. staff going hospitals manage good job keeping sickness away vulnerable patients.

So somehow blame ""all us"" seems bit unnecessary. possible protect places. reason I’m approaching entirely theoretical discussion don’t believe second trials fail get black participants. think it’s difficult get people say yes demographics, really think sufficient percentage people asked say yes. US substantial educated black middle class population, multiple African American schools thought historical narratives. really thought experiment IMO. wondering stole it... economy nowhere go [but] up

This definitely true. There's reason Warren Buffet buying stocks. nowhere near bottom. frustrating many people think like dad. people could get heads asses, things bad. I'm seriously worried see what's coming next month so. lease suburban Houston set expire August 31. planned renewing moving PITA (especially now) mentioned anything office staff. got nice surprise two weeks ago office left renewal notice door saying renewed now, there'd rent increase. I've rented Houston 20 years first. renewed lease next day. saying close 1.1% though? Well CDC says infected 0.26% chance death. obviously varies depending age health go down.

1 7 die heart disease cancer

1 114 die car crash Hey seen around well? Market (Appraisal) value tax collectors real thing, usually reassessed every 7 years, generally still less sell place for, upward trending market least. Moving work couple months super pleased affordable living rent prices  randomly cherry picked nordic baltic states, weird coincedence. Literally countries world better deaths per capita comparison, sweden happily sitting position 7. duh Face shields don’t really anything aerosol particules- mouth eyes aren’t covered. basically splash guard. aren’t safe aerosols office unless respirator etc. dead fuck LOL No, think majority would even want able. think form harm reduction would least move needle. Like steps take, need start something productive think police riots bad, ain't seen shit yet. 

Imagine streets gonna look like people can't eat going lose everything have. I'll moving apt next month, opposite mindset - used covid low mortgage rates buy house. Finally chance ladies LOL, another intelligent rebuttal. Crested hundred degrees May first time years. Mighty chilly here. reopening schedule? hospitalizations start spiking California, get pass. moment, cases going California hospitalizations yet, % positive rate decreasing, lot increase cases may coming increased testing, remains seen. cant said states like Texas Arizona, seeing huge increases cases, also hospitalizations % positive rates. We'll see week California's hospitalization stands. fucked Trump, cases outpacing testing, spreading fast. Good luck. Seriously. I’ve gone twice patios solid amount space, wearing mask going bathroom, etc. Plenty safer options one feels need leave house. spot you. Buyers 10%, supply 25%. starting pick bit, get 8 houses list look week 2 left Sunday. Houses built 3 years ago sold $275k market $320k selling days.

The big issue many realtors. Since put information see house ""for covid tracing reasons"", get multiple messages multiple realtors every house come market.

I'll wait out. right house important playing games. privilege paying $1k/month live 5 bedroom house 8 people San Francisco. WAY Outer Sunset. tell people live used live five blocks beach, figure luxury. let believe it.

The upside furthest MUNI stop, got pick seat way downtown every morning. Unfortunately chances winning presidency 2020 always slim-to-none; however, really fresh important ideas. hope runs form office get government experience tries years. multi-generational homes going bad scenario.

Although part wonders perhaps younger generations cautious worry bringing home killing family. 

Then again, may giving people much credit. Highest antibody numbers I’ve seen coming NYC 21%. source 70% Italy? Let's go _____ get free 2 weeks hotel - hybrid staycation vacation? But..but..college football NFL coming right up! could possibly go wrong? /s stating UK US rely tourism economy. New Zealand small economy, tourism rich western tourists show big way country. making statement raw amount travelers. 

Also, People travel US UK much vacation. Business traveling much bigger countries new zealand moment time. reliance tourism take away another users statement made geographical advantage island though containing virus Zealand kinda lucky way, island able impose strict border controls. He's 72 heart surgery. Good him. He's risk category risk managing fitness. Salute. failed country many pay lives getting sick I'm Brazilian thought exactly same, USA country. thought Trump Bolsonaro would present hero ""war-time presidents"", experiencing insane (and unjustified) approval boost Bush Jr got 9/11, essentially getting free reelection. pretend care would go history heroes fighting unbeatable odds. uniquely Trump, though. However bad party is, normally smart enough set aside partisan politics crisis. Trump takes everything personally, cannot stand criticized without attacking critics.

He right thing someone criticizes wrong thing, can't admit he's ever done anything wrong. he's done something, automatically right thing, keep it, screaming vice virtue top lungs. think may also depend people renting help pay mortgage, renting business/major source income.  Maybe it’s different per state, counties/municipalities near reassess every 7 years. Depending market could average that, really dependent local comps. agencies certified antibody tests enough specificity general use, private. article joke. live studio wanted upgrade one bedroom better neighborhood. ended finding one quickly two months free rent deal waived fees would cut additional $100 month signed autopay. said done new apartment ended price I’m paying studio.

Anyone interested moving, research find incredible deals there! No, obviously number factors contributing spikes... but...

I think what's giving people perception absolute inconsistency media reporting stuff, 180 degree mixed messages experts one day say we're dead someone wants reopen small business, next day saying healthy safe go crowd outside business shout cops. fact always tell 100% accuracy media likes doesnt like people depending whether activity ""kill everyone coronavirus"" not. 

Why Reddit Twitter get rid ""Stay Home"" tabs soon BLM protests happened? longer care promoting ""Stay Home"" message, want bring card anyone anything like (like running competing brick-and-mortar businesses)? 

See, suddenly 180 degree turns rhetoric start making sense. They're using pandemic advantage, plain simple, calling us ""granny killers"" whatever stand way and... know... want jobs back. generally courteous. stay 6 feet away, wear mask required (certainly outdoors), wash hands way often. Therse voluntary concessions help keep strangers comfortable safe.

But I'm going stop hanging friends, stop going bars restaurants, scared tiny chance becoming seriously ill. virus concern much.  That's question local Department Labor I'm SF Bay, rules could stricter No. Especially, protestors people want listen follow safe distancing. Even vaccine coming soon, expect years going dealing virus. prepare going come fall. think going another lockdown might something worse. Correlation? think not. 🤪 love landlords tell us end net drain resources / 'the economy' like still fresh pandemic got 2 bed luxury apartment 10 mins ATL $1700. Last year viewed apt. $2250.  called March ask still interested prices dropped much. sounds like son man gets rocks off. Picture playing mitigation efforts ever another 2 weeks, month, half year... it’s insane.

The world look horror doubt. Either way - lock hard possible, give time figure proceed. Every country done this. Let’s see fuck end this. said states laws this. otherwise every landlord would wait one week move date send renewal letters. also, always good idea options case. many deals would happily look get ready sign use leverage. end day, tenant moving costs weeks possibly months lost revenue. pisses most. wear damn mask could take care this. I’ve gotten point wearing N95 P100 mask public help protect maskless idiots. recommending everyone know easily obtainable (at least locally.) Every time see supportive comments like think marvel zombies. became self aware started trying manage situation. 


Of course devouring universe several others. I'd venture completely uninformed ad-hoc reckon probably half virus itself, half could Excuses what? walked said back people wearing masks there's vaccine stance political.  


That's 'leaves legendary gym' that's ""isn't currently going favorite gym"" Oh, worry. Texas time catch up. context it. Saying, ""I left work"" ""I left wife"" different meanings. ambiguity headline could mean left gym disassociating it, left gym leaving building. Usually bodybuilders professional athletes, one gym go that's it. leave gym, going another one now.

You right interpretation headline, see replies, could worded better clarity. feel guilty stop anything workout like day two. many freedumbs. Whats psychological term that? Group think? 

It’s really weird Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Shhh. people watch networks, soundbites reinforce beliefs. networks hosted many many debates trade-off public health peaceful demonstration. Yes, working vaccine would amazing, even isn’t one there’s still many reasons optimistic.

1. Deaths continue fall
2. Doctors getting better treatment 
3. Virus could getting weaker close borders US visitors business people. travel China.
That save .... Proportionally totality Civil War bloodiest conflict US history even close. want live society, must infringe people's right \*by wearing fucking mask\* getting sick.

Your claim rights infringes people's rights. GET IT? B L U E

F L U Boy pesky constitutions “rules” love man miss 100% shots take. Oof. misreas. I'm saying sound like church goers criticize. Thinking cause special one science apply. 

Did read indoor groups wrote due protests. Carpoolerd, bathrooms, etc. guess like ignore like hear.

Masks even mostly N95 solve eveeything. Add that, see lot people like wear masks around chins protests. pretty freaking ridiculous that. Getting instagram photo guess. can't believe dude still alive. mom buying tabloids filled misadventures child, 400 years ago. guess cocaine fact hell drug. precedent set long ago. government corporations lie people result, many trust them. understandably so. causes enormous problems. okay got joke hear regarding shutdown pointless point. Ontario Canada, neighbors sides parties(teenagers 20 somethings) Phase 1, gone Phase 2 know sacrifices made nothing month back shutting know it, damn depressing... 9-month old understands object permanence. Trump Boss Baby IRL stop reading articles tuning broadcasts Wow, cats weird, right. That's super weird. Agreed extent. However, previous rallies done people specifically flaunting virus protective measures. masks, ""free hugs rona"" conspiracy theorists. Whereas every BLM protest I've 99% people wearing masks, organizers specifically telling people wary virus giving free masks needed. sneaking suspicion least cops secretly given hydroxysnakeoil. look federal police dc see N95 masks don’t rank uniform formation difference masked unmasked. masks optional. optional cops take them, do? one other? They’re optionally wearing uniforms.

Because cops think immune. ones wear masks cops don’t want take drug. Considering every single antibody study Germany, Sweden, Japan west coast produced IFR less 0.4% strange use one clearly outlier state questionable recording methods. Ya know, smart people staying home spite bars restaurants reopening. poor staff dealing Karen’s get fix spite fact endangering everyone around them. 

I feel bad staff places. Damn. cold one ya? War ""another cause death"". frontline workers suffered much higher casualty rate also voluntarily. difference war affect young disproportionately pandemic affects everyone. relationship terminated. Yes, US. article. Oh, saying basketball, actually mentioned that, sorry. saying baseball seems less like likely place contract since played outside. 

Yeah... basketball... one seems like pretty bad idea. guess players get tested every game, viral load sufficient test positive? One thing STILL confused likelihood testing positive pre-symptomatic. still don’t get people think fake. U.S. simply make fact 116k people dead? country pull dead bodies ass? mass graves NYC? must fake right? /s 

Fucking people man. hate place. get cyclical years people damn stupid. We're healthcare workers. Even food service folks custodial staff. yes, even techs. Anyone shred intelligence ability think able figure out. Unfortunately, USA lot people think they're free thinkers parrot talking heads say. It’s few. 3 states struggling biggest states country, Florida Texas Cali. course that’s gonna talked man could could say overtly biased social media posters. Please read latest stats likely affect per CDC. 50, approximately 1 5000 chance killing you. Less, probably, drive take get there. Prisoners people, don’t really contribute spread wider community. could made profit like dumbass hats!

The problem Trump terrible businessman can't let ego get way greed.  Seems reasonable, wouldn’t go gym currently would definitely leave store people weren’t wearing masks. 

Then idiots like Joe Rogan says “masks bitches.” lift finger.
Too busy finding scapegoats. No. stance masks. countries allow travel sweden.
It interesting see happens. least portion protestors wearing masks, outdoors. GOP convention 4 people total masks indoors. covered previous post forgive quoting myself.

""  

WELL fair.. white house adopted mask wearing would much harder claim virus hoax, blown, media conspiracy oust president, testing needed , ready open threat passed etc etc. Actions speak louder words... gets hard spin things wearing mask.

Edit: Feel free add list.. quotes welcome encouraged. Would interesting look direct quotes would undermined speaker wearing mask time."" Another way I've heard clarification phrased effect ""Evolution tend towards best solution, trends towards sets traits work."" That’s actually good point. first wave doesn’t actually fully end second wave come. Aha...confirmation knows Rapture apply (; give many fucks...It's rest idiots live egocentric. sad truth want continue keep virus indefinitely, New Zealand need keep borders closed much longer that.

As long cases world, population completely susceptible could spread like wildfire.  right, are. I'm sure asymptomatic totally spreading it, right CDC? joke.  hopped history see always stupid caught bad day. clearly former. 4,400 new cases yesterday Texas.

And ass face decides blame anyone wrong, problem people refuse masks, people refuse contact tracing, people still told wash fucking hands. 

Our elected officials top bottom pretending shit big deal. Meanwhile doctors scientists getting death threats leaving jobs. 

Idiocracy winning. China Flu poster. Ignore him. Well, fair, he's also committing crimes humanity 4 years now, like outright refusing believe climate change, backimg paris climate accords could stop selling coal china use ourselves. makes sense

Remember 2009 UN Climate Change Conference Copenhagen, Denmark, Obama barged meeting attended leaders China, India, Brazil, South Africa, attended Wen Jiabao, insisted negotiations (which resulted agreement principle).
As Chinese, definitely support Premier Wen, time, marvel Obama's drive respectable opponent cares long-term interests world perspective.
And Trump personally torn America apart, making China's adversary profit-minded villain
I know Americans may want hear it, general consensus China Trump simply worth China targeting for, long China nothing wrong even nothing, US government go deep end own. can't get past ""It'll make look weak"" what's best people around them.  really bad? policies one outdoor restaurant went to? source? Fauci every single government official said case since day 1.

It also single mistake, took list names people died testing positive corona happened one happened notable ongoing homicide case immediately noticed.

There doctor planet would suggest 120,000 died US corona. true expert going know media well enough know message without snazzy soundbite accompany get drowned probably even picked first place. Famous last words. Wait till fall. idea Reddit lol following now, thanks mean cite? citation? article? quote? many backing downsides... Here's some:

Social isolatoon effect immune system:
- effect lockdown state lockdown extremely dangerous point view vulnerability entire population new pathogens,” peer-reviewed simulations agreement studies current epidemic wave UK Italy absence interventions approximate duration 2-3 months, numbers deaths lagging behind time relative overall infections. Importantly, results present suggest ongoing epidemics UK Italy started least month first reported death already led accumulation significant levels herd immunity countries.

Describing hunger risks: result coronavirus outbreak subsequent economic ramifications, food agency found additional 130 million people could brink starvation end year. working poor would hit hardest result decline tourism exports, collapse oil prices declines foreign aid.

Interview Arif Husain, chief economist director research, assessment, monitoring United Nations World Food wish people said something understand clinging onto 3.4% figure like life depends it. Let tell number comes from, apparantely need research you...

[WHO Director-General's opening remarks media briefing COVID-19 - 3 March info 3rd Globally, 3.4% reported COVID-19 cases died. comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer 1% infected. 

This CASE fatality ratio. We're arguing IFR remember? 

Now let's look says IFR shall we...

[In February, World Health Organization reported estimates IFR 0.33% onto sources... 

T[he University Oxford Centre Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated global CFR 0.8 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) IFR 0.10 0.41 percent (last revised 2 1 May antibody testing New York suggested IFR credible source suggests IFR even 2%. median IFR based antibody studies 0.26%, ranged **0.02% 0.86%.**

There scientific basis IFR 3.4%. mod r/COVID19 r/science, know Spanish Flu 2.5%. 

This literally lowest low estimates, heavily disputed. range 3-18%, taking lowest estimate purporting fact disingenous.

Meanwhile even considering using median 0.26%, supported CDC, Oxford Centre Evidence-Based Medicine. also somehow ignoring study cited, hilarious. article:

 

This one travel helped spread virus includes New York residents left city non-New Yorkers visited passed city. infections dispersed around country, travel New York longer main factor shaping progression epidemic, researchers said. 

The fact insist acting NYC residents fault shows specific beef NYC, seem incapable accepting later reality. 

Keep prejudices yo yourself. There's hope Arkansas! moved back state honestly much potential beauty sacrifice racists, fanatics, pure, unfiltered idiocy. climate change refugees need place go, state gonna become lit AF. Yeah, Christians need SEEN really point them. None, doom wishes Bro, smart enough figure yourself. knew hey first saying it. think even said sub months ago told us wear masks ""Turns freedom tastes lot like ventilator tube"" - u/Nurse_Hatchet willing make bet? What’s under? California mostly increased testing. went barely 60k day. hospitalization rate stayed fairly level. anti body data data new york correct, is.

do anti body test data suggest lower number used? Yeah ... That's don't. Americans love war. also see images thousands dead bodies look like. deaths mostly hidden private. overwhelming be. use people know care try make understand numbers talking actually mean. Yeah watched live-streams home looters masks protestors. even protestors masks would take shout share microphones hug stuff. support cause even 7 year old looking screen asking idiots.

(Which problem me, without even thinking mutter “idiots” see unmasked people public started need stop lol) New Zealand failed again? sounds like let one slip, execute proper protocol contain issue further. 

Meanwhile, greatest country world /s. Nero twiddles twitter  Wishing well surgery recovery, imagine nerve wracking must time... One day, covid go away. goes away matters way more. think so? small business hires 5 independent contractors, work part time I'm full-time doctoral student. point I'm pushing back insisting &amp; clients wear masks. concern clients start complaining ppl work arent requiring masks. people honestly worse. It’s like know wrong don’t give fuck it, someone speaks get high horse totally lose shit. many videos online people cursing, insulting, even coughing others faces, called wearing masks.

These people fucking normal, something wrong head. Yeah real, people country problem able admit “hey maybe wrong” education fuckeddd taught learned Christopher Columbus landed Plymouth Rock. kind shit that? they’d stop prescribing shit like benzos. Would better comparison India Brazil then? US? countries smaller deaths per capita maybe Swedish brigade’s view... Fucking hell. Read “ar-kansas” instead way it’s supposed pronounced live states. That's fucking lie lol interested seeing source code, app open source: also separated part fetches formats data library use: Good know. Thank better reporting news CNN. increased TTI obviously really good thing, bad news summer travel restrictions lifted. mean increase cases ultimately deaths, know would, sadly.

If TTI ambitious enough suppose could hinder spread telling ill people isolate, still lot regions Sweden lot contagion, probably managed protect elderly, suddenly people start moving around country chances protected elderly people regions big cities get infected might well increase - apply TTI ambitiously enough, and/or solid plan going protect elderly homes. course oldest elderly risk. Middle aged people too. younger people well. Sorry ... I'm thinking loud discussing, worrisome say least.

Let's hope works somehow ... Murica listens political wind bags rather science. Yeah struggle enough influenza Viruses already need deadly Coronaviruses like one circulating addition. would get crazy idea like that? almost nobody wears on, asians. became mandatory public transport, put soon walk door. NETHERLANDS here. thing individuals likely fine. lot people's parents grandparents not. use half face P100 easy breathe cardio. little fine get winded climbing stares. Note wear masks MUST cover exhale valve sealed fabric layer exhales filtered (no reason filter exhale work mask). yes, would less dangerous.  compassionate release clause all

The issue New Zealand citizens allowed see dying relatives months, sudden government allows non-citizens tested go public. sarcasm Swedish authorities acting surprised people gotten sick. opening back curve flattened. plan never eliminate virus, spread cases hospitals get overwhelmed. plan stay inside virus eliminated, never going leave house again. According analysis, “Alabama’s new cases rose 97% 5,115 week ended June 14” compared prior week. There's time effort. automated. pay fixed percentage charges charges preapproved. said, still ton worthless bureaucracy. think healthcare socialized agree spirit saying. I'm clarifying system actually works. Captain Obvious Strikes Again! misspelled That's barely even comprehensible sentence. would refused wear trump 2020 mask. would burned wore sock, panty shield, torn piece underwear, anything $\*&amp;@( trump 2020 mask! factor 10 more


lets assume true. also true folks passed away covid books?

i seen estimates number anywhere .12 1 percent.....i think going vary based local population....

for worth, new york city 8,400,000 residents. 

as today, taking confirmed covid deaths probable ones 22,145/8,400,000 x 100 = .26 percent knows. estimate might right nose. haven’t explained it’s ‘major discomfort’ wear piece cloth lighter clothes anyway wear. 

‘Preferring’ wear mask pandemic comes dick, personal preference. Nobody ‘wants’ wear mask, adult put it. 

Again, it’s personal preference style statement affects you, could literally kill people including parents grandparents. Deliberately daft pretending hugely inconvenienced small piece cloth thing, sorry. 

Those ‘prefer wear mask’ sort protected class, you’re bunch dicks. “XYZ State isn’t never New York!”

... mean: Boy sure convenient excuse rationale Sweden whenever country region better, region worse proves superior strategy handling Sweden... many mixed feelings this. First foremost: tragedy terrible depressing, made worse like natural disasters could avoided, rather one created terrible policies Swedish officials.

On action one hand good honor recognize dead. hand: maybe instead holding symbolic memorials *parliment get ass gear take action stop Swedes dying uncessarily*. guess one mutually exclusive. maybe helps cause want turn ship around. 

DN recently heart wrenching memorial dead. read bits sad: 

Hopefully awareness grows, pressure # grow course corretion towards TEst, Trace, Isolate, currently seems finally happening, slow motion, speed up. wasnt saying cant done prisoners little control protections prisons often didnt institute good safeguards, hence rapid spread. guess numbers registered accurately country. includes *over* reporting (US) under-reporting (China).

Just opinion course.  much longer. Florida, past 2 weeks number tests week (~230k) first week May tests (~245k) performed now. 7 day moving average new cases first week May around ~650, today ~2000. Sources official Florida covid testing numbers, 7 day moving average. can't speak states, Florida's numbers product increased testing. haven’t answered question.. you’re wearing N95 mask, gloves staying home isolating going essentials, get infected?

None doomsayers sub answer it. You’re end day, responsible safety.  it’s damn caravan! Moooooooo.. moooo... moo? Herd, hello? “Practicing social distancing months” ...and? doesn’t change fact monstrously stupid go bar 15 friends precautions pandemic. Social distancing doesn’t give immunity virus. US still increasing numbers cases. literally brain dead fucking idiot believe going right large groups way good idea. thought okay doesn’t change fact exposed dozens people virus cause permanent brain lung damage reason literally fucking stupid comprehend staying inside couple months doesn’t magically gift 100% viral immunity. news sky appears blue sometimes positive percent tests going up. florida testing more. 30k day 2 weeks. totally see comment made comic/cartoon. Big huge babies american flags semi automatic weapons. can’t, that’s bad statistics

It’s reasonable Sweden happened cases neighbours pure chance. 

In country dozens regions, often almost identical culture population density, one regions hit much worse others, primarily random chance. Viruses spread chaotic. 

You conclude death numbers alone tiny sample size countries Sweden’s response worse. say went recommendations, implies worse use different strategy, can’t look neighbouring countries. agree completely. people cant help guess. mean, place people huff puff sweats *most likely* wipe machines probably dangerous place COVID pandemic. absolutely correct, hate reality. Take upvote... think world needs shut orders US Brasil least year. one allowed leave countries go in. county brought us pandemic, laughable came Uk visiting dying father also family New Zealand. /r/noshit aint much honest work honest, ever Sweden? people already stand 2 meters apart waiting line grocery store bus, physically intimate friends acquaintance. considerate, Swedish culture... high risk category generally unhealthy obese, probably worried C-19.

For 80% general population, little risk. either symptoms mild, cold-like symptoms. minority develop something akin bad dose flu bed-ridden 2-3 weeks discovered myself. 

If higher risk category, chance require hospitalisation, also good chance recover. would prudent cocoon risk.

**How slaughterhouses became breeding grounds coronavirus**

High infection rates among employees worldwide put working practices renewed scrutiny

*Emiko Terazono London Andres Schipani São Paulo JUNE 8 2020*

It hectic time Brazilian prosecutors negotiating country’s meat suppliers implement measures protect slaughterhouse workers coronavirus. 

“Abattoirs hotspots Covid-19,” said Priscila Dibi Schvarcz, labour prosecutor highlighted unsafe conditions faced employees, including “many people working shoulder shoulder without \[social\] distancing” slow spread virus.

For years, critics accused industrial meat industry — supplying global meat market estimated worth $1.4tn, according Barclays — practices cause range health, animal welfare environmental issues. outsized infection rate among slaughterhouse workers coronavirus crisis shone light working practices facilities. 

From Americas Europe Australia, abattoirs become important vectors infection, plants around world forced close infection breakouts. US 20,000 meat-packing plant workers fallen ill, according Food Environment Reporting Network, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, France UK faced similar issues slaughterhouses. 

The problem exacerbated meat-processing employees designated essential many countries. meant generally carried working close-confines, helping spread disease wider community. 

Marion Nestlé, NYU Marion Nestle, professor emerita nutrition, food studies public health New York University, said many consumers aghast learn meat-packing plants operated. “People horrified working conditions sector,” said. 

“A lot people going get sick get meat table. \[Meat processors\] interested getting meat \[workers\] helpless,” added. 

The background crisis consolidation aggressive cost-cutting caused fierce competition among meat groups domestic export market share, said Enrico Somaglia, deputy general secretary European Federation Food, Agriculture Tourism Trade Unions. “It race bottom,” said. 

Ms Dibi Schvarcz, prosecutor, said highest concentrations cases state Rio Grande Sul slaughterhouses located. prosecutors sued JBS, world’s largest meat-packer, failed agree deal improve conditions employees, said. 

Her observations line analysis US Centers Disease Control Prevention, pointed cramped working conditions processing lines long working hours part reason disease spread rapidly plants. 

Unions blamed low-cost business model reliant high production levels. This, turn, led increased speed lines process carcasses, requiring employees work close proximity. Medical leave policies remuneration structures industry also incentivised employees keep working even experienced symptoms virus, CDC said. 

In Germany, number-two pork exporter US, meat industry come intense scrutiny following series slaughterhouse closures virus outbreaks. 

The sector traditionally relied cheap migrant labour brought subcontractors remain competitive. Working 60 hours week, migrants live seven eight per accommodation provided subcontracting agencies — conditions one European meat company executive privately acknowledged “modern slavery”. 

“The common factor \[globally\] tough working conditions, workers often sub-contracted or . . . temporary contracts,” said Mr Somaglia. 

Stung outcry, German government announced proposals tighten regulation industry, banning subcontracting workers meat plants setting minimum standards accommodation employees. 

Farmers meat industry reject demonisation sector. North American Meat Institute, represents processors, said: “The health safety men women work facilities first priority. challenge keep employees safe fulfilling special responsibility make food.” 

JBS said employee health “priority” regretted way prosecutors holding responsible spread Covid-19 Brazil. country’s big meat groups Brazil Foods Marfrig settled country’s authorities. 

Denmark, large pork exporter, notable outlier amid wave slaughterhouse outbreaks, handful workers becoming ill. 

Lars Hinrichsen Danish Meat Research Institute, said country’s meat plants boasted high levels automation manned well-paid workers. “If cheap labour, don’t incentive automate,” said. 

Jais Valeur, chief executive Danish Crown, Europe’s largest meat producer, said workers paid $30 hour, compared $14 hour US. “Part answer reduce labour automate,” said. 

The business practices meat industry remained largely opaque partly due lack curiosity among consumers, also suited many companies keep way. 

Danish Crown, however, stressed transparency plants. “We’ve got nothing hide,” Mr Valeur said. “It’s important people know actually involves produce what’s table also willing pay it.” 

Amy Fitzgerald, associate professor University Windsor Ontario, Canada, written social history slaughterhouses, said good came pandemic meat industry, would heighten awareness industrial production process. 

“No one really wanted think meat produced attention that’s brought industry culture helpful,” said. Keep believing lies...  didnt also change number get heaven apparent believers could get heaven. states appear slowly converging towards other.

Thank you. think know mean.
I really appreciate it. Point? Deaths always lag behind cases. jobs letting work remotely making permanent option people leaving expensive areas less expensive save money. demand shifting crazy expensive areas less expensive areas. [Shit y'all caught I? 1,239 new cases and 102 new deaths today already did. 95% people party herd immunity per se, stats down.

No, really. stats mostly bullshit.

At end March, Sweden stopped testing suspected cases, meaning seriously ill high risk groups tested. Everyone else told isolate without illness ever confirmed.

What mean beginning April end May, number cases kept artificially low. result making case fatality ratio high. Globally, CFR stands 5.4%. Sweden, even couple weeks expanded testing criteria, CFR 9.2%.

This artificial suppression case numbers lead apparent ""flattened curve"". started testing people mild symptoms again, rate growth daily number cases returned March.

As numbers receiving intensive care, also kept artificially low due many patients groups likely need intensive care simply denied it. even got point government opened investigation find many people denied treatment, despite apparently plenty free beds available. easy maintain low numbers ICU simply refuse send people ICU old kidney problems.

Finally, get deaths. sure seems like drop number deaths... except one thing... takes average 20 days deaths occurred one day reported. example, today's data release added death total May 20 (28 days) May 24 (24 days).

Basically, none numbers May 28 onwards trusted, *will* change, way knowing much change.

The Swedish government vested interest keeping numbers low possible long possible, hope second wave strike nations make numbers climb closer levels Sweden. can, open incognito mode. feel like problem people talking death. dying covid ending hospital. wait til mass evictions Covid pay runs July.

Serious question: specific constitutional right think applies situation? dont know located area, people already freaking buying everything. Fucking toilet paper, alcohol pads, hand sanitizer, etc stock MONTHS small shipment would go hour. Imagine said masks necessary. Even still costly get. Packs $30+ stores here. 

**HOPSITALS** low point reuse them. google lol depends live. know are, city one lowest costs living US. 

It lot, though. I'll give that. depends living, bills, kinds things factor in. probably give cut Yes sure. mean get paid probably 2 3 times people get states cost living takes much anyway. No, said wants seem like 120K people dying day normal.

Because correct. could actually see Abbot something meaningful November Trump loses. Abbot election 2022 he's got cover, Trump wins there's chance Abbot crosses him. last two weeks I've several restaurants bars. Masks enter patrons sit wear mask. Watching local news even know there's virus going around right lines thoughts well. northeast everyone gathering indoors (heated) air conditioning exploded winter months there.  I'd wager humidity also plays role. Orlando airport elsewhere? Congrats testing negative. DeSantis moron Economy lives. Actually 20 year old prisoners wearing masks. test, case. test, find something wrong people. didn’t testing, would cases roughly 70,000 students rolling town 2 months incubation anywhere two days 14 days, generally death occur (not fact average) three weeks symptoms onset I've read possible waves deaths happen month outbreaks.

Yea lives Staten Island? lol. Place terrible. Flying safe respirator, cloth procedure masks completely inadequate. hurt you? said wants seem like 120K people dying day normal. *know* he's itching wartime powers That’s I’m it.... Hmm people forced wear masks, maybe things would get better. lot people realize govt raises property taxes year too. Usually $50-$100... that's good argument increase. Nope people criticized, you’re really good generalizing people wonder learned that. like coping mechanism information like, blame left young. That’s exactly here, example wrong. Good him. Setting example rest us. Unlike coward Joe Rogan preaches anti-mask rhetoric hiding ivory tower tested daily. locker room production staff going ""the bubble"" luxeries. reminds Harold Camping. would declare world would end, nothing happens, revises new date. think 6th prediction suffered stroke.

Get ready USA. Soon see new #1 state ranks dead last country education (US News &amp; World Report). Surely trust people research make responsible decisions based scientific evidence presented. could possibly go wrong? 

On top that, Montgomery's city council voted making masks mandatory, councilman Lyon saying """"At end day, illness pandemic comes throw constitutional rights window."" I'm glad hear constitutional right spread disease remains intact... /s

I'm temporary transplant Montgomery amazed every day stubbornness blissful willful ignorance current situation residents taking. think I'll ride one home finally time leave.

Edited spelling. Testing drastically increased recently. ICU hospitalizations deaths probably better metrics watch since many cases get caught. Even non-profits need break even cover operating expenses.

That's nationalized healthcare system probably better pandemics; hospital even need make money supported state. Spoke friend week flew there. said people airport wear mask. However told put masks allowed board plane. maybe it’s airline requirement rather airport requirement? dentists always use masks would propose doing? could possible propose target X amount businesses ruin people's lives. terrible catch-22 dilemma face governor. absolutely winners, losers government tries control this. government simply money handle crisis like this, spent years left nothing rainy day fund. faults allowing government spend every dime give leave nothing reserve. going take trillions come this.

I'm starting accept fact I'm going get virus, regardless happens. kids, come contact kids/etc give me. matter time get it, hope send ER. Prices always go up, way things are. found unsustainable bought house, many people means buy house (I means qualify zero-down mortgages).

However, nice nightmare rental tenancy, sucks. update data day /r/CoronavirusAZ Would love better job, got one me?

Not many options 20somthing poor go college interesting enough get grants scholarships fulfil diversity quotas.

How supposed go school pick extra job pay it? debt rest life? I'd worse position now. much this. people crowding streets people called lockdown protestors idiots. It’s hypocritical. ""nobody could genuine care people, therefor they're pretending order raise social status... believe everyone, deep down, psychopath like me"" Yeah, thinks pandemic control? NASCAR race Talladega, Alabama week. track mandating fans wear masks allowing tailgating infield first track since sport resumed post COVID. Sure help things. even close knowing many younger people essentially disabled life this.

Think first responders 9/11 effected, death toll  gradual still happening. possible effects Floyd riot reopening schedule? ""Swindled"" podcast great episode him. actually listened morning.

I looking one couple months ago, I’ve decided holding tech better athletics, I’ve heard that’s it’s weak point. Horrible :/ work guys did! Nah, middle ground raising minimum wage people income compatible cost goods. $600/40hrs=$15/hr. People want go back work unemployment they're making twice federal minimum wage finally seeing lives could better little extra money. hope Hannity goes history badly this.

7 may : 821 new cases, 99 new deaths. 
5 June: 1143 new cases, 77 new deaths. 


5 days ago:
Sweden announced highest daily tally novel coronavirus infections, record 1,474 new cases authorities said due long-delayed surge testing.

Today : 1239 new cases, 102 new deaths. 


You think goes that's looking 5 ago record Sweden surge testing. people enforcing masking policies unionized, pretty much old boomers, give shit one way another. That's policies talk start see serious bans people complying. Inflation gentrification. Even nothing changes, prices go every year simply due inflation.

The apartment rented 2010 $1550/mo Seattle currently $4500/mo. happened interim Amazon moved neighborhood. Yeah stupid American Paper money would ruined GOV. Cuomo. cumstain ordered nursing homes take covid patients upped death numbers put money rich people's pockets cost sick elderly. Nothing like pumping numbers keep us scared 🤪 Backlogged cases deaths. Sorry honey, wrong. could even say statement **false easily verifiable.** Canadians flying back forth every day months. US allowing in, Canada allowing citizens return country *promise* quarantine. fact, **your link even contradict wish would take twenty seconds google shit.**  Agreed. ridiculous people point fingers nursing homes fault highly infectious disease getting in. impossible track every staff member every minute every day. majority facilities get infected, staff asymptomatic bring in. time first case even confirmed late spread quick far-reaching. people pointing fingers ones lot times wear masks public argue need open economy back up. forget yes, nursing facilities population elderly, however, staff not. staff ones interacting freely society bringing in. responsible need blame, react unified whole instead trying isolate...it work facilities incorporate ages operations. Yes. gathering people households inside, whether it’s restaurants, church, put graduation party wedding.  herd immunity take 70percent.

400k cases. 20 million people?? 

not even close herd immunity. 

morgue trailers full dead people keep real enough stay home. I'm surprised r n g e automodded locked new york spreading amongst essential workers. Arizona, Florida, Texas spreading amongst everyone. Remember, locked social distancing measures all. asked question answered it. 

More dancing around form you. I've got mobile app worry Right. Absolutely. long term costs make short term costs throwing trillion problem seem absolutely insignificant.

Giving every meat packers ICU employee Full face PAPR gas mask thousands got sick would cost lot, secondary spread would prevented would huge.

The main problem mind didn’t declare world war 3 stupid virus January. Even march would made huge difference.

Really though, people willing wear mask next year-ish we’re likely superfucked anyways. It’s third country decided we’re going herd immunity horrifyingly painful way. get there? North FL started opening early May Miami Dade May 20 May 27 opening dates different things. c.nñ coming bt cc h back hug b Chicco CV b Phase 3 lasts long infection rate low. large epidemic, take nearly long Never ending lol so...it's dangerous need mask...but dangerous eating?

Lets honest - need mask eating, danger magically go away sticking food mouth. actually apologize, numbers off. Populations close, FL double. this? NYC cannot get 1 bedroom less 1800 generally. Including outer boroughs. Minimum 2k Manhattan that's way fuck uptown. Right? Maybe China hadn’t tried cover long WORLD wouldn’t shitstorm first place. that. living near washington dc 1 bedroom basement apartment paying $1000 paying considerably less others unless living group home 30% man... stubborn.  context trump’s idiot compared pandemics?

Which ones? F Antifa bogeyman now. COVID april 2020! saying millionaires play NBA going sit back let owners F life ruin careers taking precautions McDonalds seedy bar Orlando would take covid?  Putin may disinfectant tunnels, trump injectant bleach, hydroxychloroquine, UV lights, fast food. handle shit. state county nowhere near that. Dishonest answer, sidestepping question. Sounds lot like Abbott TBH. Fellow Portlander here. called protests. look what’s driving disproportionate number COVID-19 cases black non-black communities, you’ll understand protesters demanding actually improve chances survival future outbreaks. options available staying healthy safe COVID-19 constructed socioeconomics, choices communities color never simple working home physical distancing (or even mail ordering groceries). health professionals condemned protests, understand importance equality improving health safety. banging drum long time remember last night talking spiking cases southern states, sounded pretty alarmed, also talking outbreaks industral plants weeks, nobody else mentioning much. cal resident here. ex gf contacted last Monday. mother lives nursing home, mom 21 people tested positive Covid. taken hospital yesterday.

That 1 nursing home. consider many nursing home city (Long Beach, CA) alone. consider entire LA County Orange County.

Where originate? someone facility? supplier/driver going loc tin location? 

We're fucked. personal theory states hit harder retained social distancing better mask use. People aware bad virus could get knows someone personally contracted disease real them. 

Here Texas, hit much April. personally know anyone sick. bet that's case vast majority people here. easier people justify thinking overblown. wish was. selfishness mind blowing. could seen coming? favorite part cases get high enough people stop packing restaurants cause another crash demand. Texas governor pretty much opened everything 75% (which basically 100%) tells us it’s fault, we’re own, closes eyes pretends it’s happening. told us enough hospital beds everyone (even beds hundreds miles away). state handling better least chance

All sounds little top it’s true. Sources:

Governor Abbot saying enough hospital beds state everyone: saying everybody responsible mask wearing, also mayors urging change stance: restaurants opening 75% : blaming young adults: wearing Dallas become frowned upon. Social places open 75% easily packing people past normal 100% capacity. Bars packed people argue try mention that’s best idea now. I’m staying inside next months. Baiting much fun, always work :'( something. Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer DeSalvo, chief health Perhaps sue leaders ignore negligence. Yeah, indicates bad NE states reached number well pandemic, long time lockdown, new states *starting* numbers, nothing control spread going outstrip us quickly.  That’s wayyyy long. 1000 deaths per day NY multiple times FL double population... go. 16th century? think Governor necessary keep hospital demand covid cases manageable level. That's happening IL. We're apparently one states best numbers, yet amount people screaming Governor needs removed they're suing state insane. Meanwhile, us millennials terrified leaving homes, obsessively sanitizing groceries, naming plants, making sourdough starters. People like ones talking about. I’m making joke. comment 100% belief people carrying specifically hoping something happens around “save day.” made mention people victimized traumatized. 

But thanks trying put words mouth! guys remember back break 100k cases worldwide, least half comments Reddit ""it's growing fast"", ""100k almost nobody, nearly bad flu!""

Well we've getting 100k cases per day, ever day, since May 27th. wait...
heaven max capacity? 

that...seems less like domain omnipotent like DMV.  Ok, yeah, actually makes sense. infection. Duh. Actually another term death-by-government, murder person people government, including genocide, politicide, mass murder. would great instead going ignore let inmates get sick bad people.

\-US society November coming. Aw man hoping they’d give us trusty ol’ big brained reply. Alas, delete Costco pizza pretty bad. agree. numbers made governments best effort hide 'em. Obviously fake much higher reality.

Edit: thought guy /s'ing. wrong. base sees Second Coming Christ, real something Simpson? Jk I'm guessing freeway something. Coming soon american city near Wow, author worked Cigna even understand talking about.  reality self-funded plan employer insurance company.  Cigna/Aetna claims paperwork (Third Party Administrator jargon - TPA) actual insurer - can't even cover claims wanted legally.  one gripe situation TPA name insurance cards right employees realize this.  claims get paid situation, employee needs angry employer TPA TPA employer ordered do.

Also, 7 figure hospital bill. article saw, bill end person ended paying zero dollars (like $50).  People read clickbait headlines ignore details undermined headline. Well hell that? I’m politician. zero power. fix then. herd doesn’t want get culled fast enough, frustration herd leader wishes acquire herd immunity... Sucks. state tried best stuck two states shit's going trickle sides. vast majority cases going undetected. 

You don’t know that. Yes duh obviously cases going undetected it’s nowhere near factor 10. doubt much it’s even factor 1.5 Heavy lifting certain exertion level general. least good while.

So maintenance stuff iirc get rusty. Oregon month month lease ends... think convenience sides feel comfortable one leaving situation lease terms. owner worry finding new tenant, tenant concerns kicked agree [x-group political sides encourage us HATE] responsible spreading virus call day?

For libs, white men cops spread virus, that's hateful towards.

For cons, blacks gays, that's hateful towards. 

/thread  I’ve really wondering happen get highly effective monoclonal antibody treatment fall. know regeneron companies saying could see couple hundred thousand like October. becomes new standard care hospitals, manage get death rate like .1%, general population stop caring? Alabama one obese states country gonna help either..... Yes, that's rapid acquisition herd immunity works there's higher mortality rate.

Hence somewhere foolish homicidal idea. Wow! Jesus fucking Christ people dumber rocks. apples oranges Hold on, trade war going two countries, one initiated US?

Why China taking advantage instance? shoe foot would US take advantage crisis? recall certain Wilbur Ross bragging outbreak China would bring jobs back US? lung transplant considered Vietnam's critically ill Covid-19 patient, British pilot, longer necessary following slow recovery.

Luong Ngoc Khue, head Ministry Health's department diagnosis treatment, said Wednesday 43-year-old man HCMC, beat Covid-19 two months remains treatment due lung infection, recovering well breathe own.

He's fully conscious capable coherent verbal communication, Khue said.

His limb muscle strength respiratory functions returned. infection also cleared up, Khue said.

""At stage, lung transplant longer necessary,"" said.

In May, health ministry considered lung transplant British pilot condition time much severe. Computed tomography scan results showed fibrosis solidified lungs, constantly relied ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) stay alive.

But condition progressed, lungs slowly got better. finally taken ventilators last week, breathed since.

When Khue expressed wish patient could soon return U.K., he quickly responded saying hometown Scotland.

""It showed reflexes neurological recovery normal levels. one would thought coma two months,"" said Khue.

The patient, pilot Vietnam Airlines, using phone entire week, getting touch friends several countries. Khue left, patient also showed scarf word ""Motherwell"" woven it. scarf gift friends Scotland, sent Cho Ray Hospital last week, he’s treated. received ""Patient 91.""

""The name ‘Patient 91’ known whole world,"" said Khue.

""Motherwell"" name football team back hometown, said patient. words also served thank-you many Vietnamese medical workers saved life.

The patient said family member left, would endeavor recover soon.

While doctors said could go home, important thing moment continue physical therapy prevent infection.

He treatment three months, longest period Covid-19 patient Vietnam.

The country recorded 335 Covid-19 cases far, ten active infections left deaths. gone two months without community transmission. California horrible yet proactive. LA cases rising despite mandatory mask. yet least. sadly normal while. parents grandparents call ""[boomerang caused high student debt, low paying jobs, wage stagnation inability children save enough afford house payment. still parents pay cell phone plans Netflix / Disney Plus / Hulu too. returning New Zealand citizens seriously try extrapolate data based 3 randomly picked days 60 day interval, use draw conclusion?

That’s embarrassing even “avlidna per dag” stop spreading absolutely blatant misinformation. Well people would stop racist none would happened would it? don’t condone killing innocent people, please keep mind protesters, people fuck shit up. it’s quite clear comment doesn’t matter someone says this, sound like don’t actually understand what’s happening people angry. trolling ignoring everything wrote. Good day. Imagine seeing crystal clearly instead there. like imprisoned nut house. plenty individuals, social groups, small towns dotted across country understand exacty what's going on, national leadership working us. citizens, we're own. Death rate completely variable depends ton different factors. country even state death rate COVID.

The thing focus killed 400k since last winter, makes pretty bad course way worse flu. got herd immunity Spanish flu right? 

Most virologists epidemiologists think mutated less deadly form, herd immunity achieved. fact, Influenza pandemics descended Spanish Flu never went away. got less deadly. That's herd immunity that's luck. give B12 shots weekly (not Covid related). nurse teaching it, told make sure alcohol clean skin dry give shot. noticed sometimes would really hurt times much nurse gave shot. Apparently alcohol still wet give shot get little alcohol inside burns. it’s dry hurts lot less. Hope helps feel better soon. one needs unnecessary pain! I'm tuscaloosa I'm terrified football season. players already started testing positive, may happen. again, plenty fresh bodies willing step in. cry wolf yell sky falling many times people realize screeching mostly political purposes. I'm still confused reversal values tests free US cost money countries socialized medicine. Social media use 60% believe virus linked 5G radiation get information YouTube, compared 14% think that’s 56% people believe there’s hard evidence Covid-19 exists use Facebook key information source, almost three times higher proportion non-believers 45% believe Covid-19 deaths exaggerated get lot information Facebook, twice 19% non-believers say same

Social media use breaking lockdown 58% gone outside Covid-19 symptoms use YouTube main information source, compared 16% 18% obeyed 2-metre rule get lot information video streaming site, contrast 42% among haven’t obeyed 37% people friends family visit home list Facebook key source, compared 23% haven’t  see political thing? natural immunity, mean said parenthesis, people immune Covid probably exposure coronavirus similar enough COVID body’s can’t tell difference. It’s people immune right Covid. “Natural” means it’s unknown source can’t identify, happened living naturally, vaccine, it, witch doctor magic lol

We see Dutch study clearly exposure something, maybe one common cold coronaviruses, maybe missing SARS-1.5, whatever else, provided immunity. mean, blood sample 2015 clearly would never exposed covid, killed like did. estimated came close contact least 320 people. Also believe tested days ago testing still completely optional citizens coming like punchline bad comfortable extrapolating five Wednesday's worth deaths. I'd need look overall trend I've thinking doing. fact, think I'll start now. "" toy ignorant fools can't even form decent argument, fun.""

Do understand arrogance makes whole world hate country? truly hate now, clear.

Why take opinons back Weibo. even get onto Reddit government blocked access?

Use VPN? break government rules comes outside tell everybody great lmao, seriously weak. Time illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. not. still agree anyone saying ""AZ next NY"" low population density essentially zero public transit.

The density may affect speed virus spreads, won’t affect overall number people get end. many people making real effort curb virus, current rate spread plenty cause problems hospital capacity. Oh ok, protest nothing it. real world did. Lol.  keep bay area wages fuck Texas something, plenty people will.

You get mansion states $500K 2 factors driving this:
1. States resuming ""elective"" procedures testing everyone comes in.
2. Dwell times increasing. think important remember people were. 25 year old white kids got back living parents house 3 months. certainly majority us New Yorkers. CCP owned company mass exporting pork back China cost workers lives?

Companies owned CCP need extra scrutiny. funny thing is, faithful supposed taken heaven apocalypse.

2. imagine lot people like idea possibly dying suffering lifelong complications. Seattle building. tons new condo buildings neighborhood. definitely helps, taking land mostly abandoned warehouses building huge urban corporate campus restaurants things do, prices naturally going rise demand grows. hell? Ontario recently expanded 20,000 tests day 25,000 day. testing went lowest Canada highest. we're still seeing declines cases despite increased testing. Imagine: 60qm apartment 6 workers living (10qm per person minimum - says one city ex). guess is, since tönnies relies heavily workers abroad, someone got Covid-19 vacation (visiting family, original home) somewhere else, came back cramped conditions, could spread easily workers. 
And common practice house foreign workers like this. agree, it’s surprising businesses don’t want turn away customers. Also surprising someone making 12 dollars hour doesn’t want confront people day wearing masks. yeah re-open get nice dollars nice meal theres nice hospital bed waiting (if lucky) Literal propaganda anti-red party crowd pretend journalists literal propaganda authoritarian tyrannical government effect gaslighting section population susceptible confirmation bias. Awesome, thanks! correct. Yeah, US apartheid state monopolistic robber barons buying political system point history WW2 

I say wasn't. said present problems caused corporate influence slowly corrupting government.

Corruption racism existed WWII, they're really cause problems we're now, they're sort accessory issues coming light government able hide pay lip service opposing more. God. stupidity mind blowing.  Public safety political. 

It's always political. Seat belts political. Clean water political. Speed limits school zones political.

We clear: public health political, comes COVID19 one two political parties come clearly ""fuck public safety"" side things. young state isn’t hotspot right would it. Texas would probably wait out. talking guy day. told turn news, people line food way nicer cars me. said Dad volunteered years ago giving away food. really homework keep people taking advantage. I'm saying people people hurting- think lot people overextended put bad position. anti-lockdown person know leased new cars spent every penny. Retired nothing. definitely could save tho. Today, South Korea’s covid-19 response strategy sits atop three pillars: fast free testing, expansive tracing technology, mandatory isolation severe cases. 

 

[South Korea: 12,198 cases, 279 sitting less 100 new cases per day since beginning April, although slight bounce back number active cases since end May.

South Korea lock either, South Korean strategy could used Sweden (for like mention lock would Swedish Constitution).

Instead testing tracing, Sweden instead chose tell people suspected infected, require hospital treatment, isolate - although legal mandate, recommendation.

They tested. contacts traced. Sweden 4 times many cases 18 times many deaths population 1/5th size. title bit attention seeking. passed death toll WW1, passed death toll American WW1 soldiers, extremely small number loses scale WW1 due around help things. Calm fuck snowflake clearly joke five-week data looks like new cases going deaths trending down. thoughts why? trouble understanding pathogens exist everywhere scientific studies prove this.

The best defense strong immune system, wearing mask avoiding people.

Are denying immune system? Amazon full face shields, worn addition masks goggles, inadequate themselves. You’re going you’re “programmed say” ignoring inequities expose black communities, urban rural, greater danger white counterparts.

There inequities class well trying ignore racial inequities direct connection economic impact racial inequities draw attention problem properly address fix issues society. Also, since we’re fixing title, word “legendary” useful here? article doesn’t say anything makes gold gym legendary (other Schwarzenegger goes lot, “legendary”?), certainly don’t know legend gold gym. following might rules civil all. Sometimes difficult confronted complete idiocy. Everyone else please forgive me.

You're dumb fuck. protest thousands standing shoulder shoulder shouting screaming? nothing correct piper coming collect due.  Brazil much worse healthcare infrastructure still done anything despite hospitals overcrowded. high hopes south. Agreed. Add cannot predict alcohol people’s decision making skills right now. went outdoor spot guy leaning friend’s shoulder screaming talking us wanted shake hands. disaster. See 2021. lean pretty far left hard ignore biased many people are. politics matter truth. would help media use logarythmic charts. people know interpret those. linear chart obvious anyone COVID cases Florida *doubled* last two weeks.  Even partly due testing, raw numbers high enough back April everything closed down, meagre testing. daily numbers *higher* back then. close-down necessary then, now? Right? read going planet fitness b4 started, they've officially reopened yet cause smart. places like golds gym ymca open parking lots packed. Imma need remove couch make home gym lmao Yeah would take like 10 years way. Real curious Nevada / Vegas does, especially casinos opening up...I think still ok/ok category... wrong, early, initial hysteria behind COVID caused tons people avoid hospital, waiting rooms empty. surge yet started. also bad sense means overloaded ICU. People dying street pouring hospital doors. They'll dying waiting ambulance. They'll dying makeshift ICU suite normal wards.

People expect wartime imagery based media initially said. told us cases would rise ICUs would overflow. built hospitals. brought Comfort. projections wrong. People followed orders way better epidemiologist predicted.  moneys guy 5 reasonable expectation. Things used got married 16-20 started family. Asking 22 year old support within capabilities taught life skills. I'm passing moral ethical judgement do, people living young age throughout human history. Heat could slow spread pretty difficult tell factors make contagious anyway. Here’s little light reading you.

Basically makes point large sample sizes needed accurate results. general rule thumb sample size grad school never go less 30 unless you’re studying rare thing. opposite true well, large studies drown findings. 

All people think studies thousands thousands participants don’t understand sampling populations work statistics math Besides problem pride, real, there's also fact Swedes one highest amounts trust authorities whole world. video pride pretty good, article too: basically, think way: mom, who's always loving kind could trust implicitly least try right thing keep safe happy slowly, subltly insane starts putting harms' way abusing trust. hurts tells hurting you, trying protect good. first want even think mother's behavior bad is. Maybe time come accept aspects bad, still rationalize behavior since love trust much. takes long time many react abuse put foot down. never able make leap. 

What Swedish people going right traumatizing many levels. government has, alone Europe, decided pursue herd immunity (see [both Tegnell Giesecke outright admitting among others) gaslighting people thinking that's what's happened Sweden, alone world., chosen One True Strategy strategies inferior ultimately leave stupid countries pursued much worse Sweden Sweden herd immunity won't. Many accept narrative government feeding since can't imagine could betrayed manner. really sad. Especially since already clinical practice led toa reduction death rate got new (old) drug substantial reduce death rate. never excuse frontloading deaths like Sweden did, strategy demonstrably failure. many can't admit part sometimes due pride, also often due able accept betray authorities. Bold assume Razorback fans find message. Arkansas upset work advertised. Cultural brinkmanship. he’s new celebrated hero now... Murdoch news orgs time.

The pot slowly rises temp, frog notice late. lot flattery convenient lies help people believe wrong things - hate experts (""the elite"") uppity facts education.

Equality law (arguable) mean opinion good mine. That's intellectually lazy version democracy I've seen.

Fox/Sky news need go away. reason things opening back economy doesnt completely crash

This times million.  Everywhere go people reopening things ""are safe."" Total bullshit.  

Things reopening ""muh economy."" Incorrect. 64,500 figure comprises registered deaths pandemic. widespread view U.S China virus control. Doesn’t home gym?

I'm sure does, seen exercising encouraging others kinda thing, can't easily home. safe eat General Tso chicken? Dude look hospitals southern states now, panicking. Keep talking empty hospitals, really current information working here. focused positive outcome. consider opposite 20% serious disease still concerning. haircuts. truuu kinds stories confuse me. read ""15 friends test positive roughly week night bar""?

Meaning person who's already living loose likely shortage exposures could yielded infection?

In words, reliably really blame one event infection? feel like owe us apology showing government eventually acts. Yeah. 24,000-62,000 deaths widespread vaccinations 100 years partial herd 

there thing partial herd immunity, deluded americans making things Unfortunately, I’ve always buying planting flowers (perennials), suck maintaining garden gets hot life busy, gets pushed back list. though? spend time working something almost every single day I’ve actually bought FEWER plants year year past. fortune came together many perennials I’ve bought grown I’ve dividing moving.

I hear home improvement store nurseries plain old nurseries busy. one nursery follow FB posts every week showing stock, explaining plants, etc., seem ton stuff, take everything go buy carload. Gyms opened back norway. mask required use looooot antibac wipe equipment mats use. Good bit sucks. Yes? Florida, don’t think see jurisdiction roll back. new norm living covid, many die governments longer willing shut economies. need act dense, friend. already know full well pretend to, mask prevent spreading virus, catching it. wear mask, coughs, sneezes, spittles pronouning 'Pacific' caught mask instead landing neighbor's steak. Arden stated would cases future. knew battle within war. believe return valid green card, would look it.

And feel able go Canada. though. 100% true. live River Oaks Houston neighbors think it’s huge conspiracy. Shilling China? said hope brought justice did. even hear countries saying that? report came today said locked 2 weeks earlier deaths would 90% less. 1 week earlier 60% less. Instead chose head sand hope goes away strategy. didn't. someone works university, we've many problems administration faculty adopting online solutions online classes. Faculty refusing teach online coursework, *absurd*. Yes, classes programs translate well, keep students campus, it? Oh, that's right: money fear new software. Housing meal plans = $$$ keeping dorm rooms single-occupant solve anything. Working mask don’t think it’s healthy specially cardio specially people type cardiac, respiratory allergic diseases. 

Going gym won’t good idea anyway, vaccine found need risk health. Hundreds touching equipments inside gym, think everyone responsible wipe equipments use , doubt that, even l wipe everything house still won’t 100% effective hundred using equipments. N95 disposables back stock many industrial supply stores FYI. mean, lick toilet seat, you’re asking lot things.  people America call impingement civil liberties totally beyond me.

You won’t civil liberties you’re dead, asshole. Also everyone would get infected time Well don’t know tell you, cuz it’s degree good states? would scary People incredibly poor sense odds. Look popular lotteries Vegas are. could anyone possibly known going happen?

/s lot country 83 million people Agree it’s percent population comparison would valid however compare recent events caused significant public blowback across US recent years reaction certainly non proportional.

If compare largest death event otherwise US Millennial history, 9/11, eclipsed body count 40x. 

These numbers astounding heartbreaking regardless proportional population percentages. people like Arnold, virus might actually get terminated. Unfortunately, evident people gym, that's going happen.

My school district put post mask policy coming school year, filled parents throwing hissy fits kids possibly wear masks.  We're doomed. really bad all. favorite little beer garden/Greek food apot spot right beach cal that's pretty much open air. high low walls, super breezy.

They take temp (probs accurate.. 96° times I've gone far) everyone masked/obeys rules. Tables far apart plastic dividers.

GF went one couple quarantining whole time too.

I know much needed get like little kid Disney Land. literally getting point dreaming ordering beer hearing background noise bar. someone permanent health issues virus that’s around 4 months? totalitarian government sheep can’t kept healthy government US doesn’t stand chance. Keep family healthy it’s responsibility. Whatever happened monkeys stole vial virus? thinking last night, unlikely football season take place. People going LOSE. THEIR. SHIT. can’t handle wearing mask “muh freedoms”, imagine reaction football canceled?! 

Honestly, though, worry lot students, course student athletes. can’t imagine effects futures, athletes due need time field order get picked NFL post-collegiate careers. Death cult. “Yikes Spikes” new state motto? Exactly, needed money live, company kept employed, audacity say ""forced"" continue working.

What hell supposed do? every company supposed lay everybody government money, absolutely destroy country process? long make $33k something year combined.

And was, wondering many furloughed/let go americans government $help higher old salaries.

Only Murica: Low salary = win/win employer, employee. ""loopholes"".  RemindMe! 45 days ""Tell guy wrong was"" wrong. I’m concerned American. seasonal kids go back school fall... mean, I'm sure someone ventilator would dialing urgent care u parrot let’s fuck technically afford paper... still struggling put food table, put kid college.

Hmmm eat week get Covid vaccine.... Correct, related nothing particular context. Trying view united states single entity container fools errand. Whenever sweden reports 0-10 deaths posts random opinion pieces blogs instead.  Omg thank reminding DISGRACEFUL individual cases difficult many. Though considering people 120K died car accidents homicides little easier.

Given average age dead 83.

The average number comorbidities 2.7

And 96% another primary cause death.

It's fair say alive even without Covid. - Dr. Fauci, February 15, 2020  Flattening curve making room ventilator you, manage consequences spread hopefully reduce mortality. course, people vents (albeit severe cases) 80%-90% mortality. recent figures. I'm familiar specific Law Murphy. describe take big risks, might face unpleasant consequences?

Must admit, Murphy's brightest observation. bought balaclavas. big beard wanted something little flush nose mouth.

Love them. I'll toss disposable mask it, let balaclava tighten mask works pretty well.

It's airtight N95, better loose fitting cloth draped across face. wish places would far Trader Joes Costco two stores requiring anything. Every store want kind situation. 

I add Target seem disinfect lot thats it. never tested specifically COVID February - place testing COVID done US Washington.

That according source. leads believe, said, might something else going on. Lol wish, live England! Don’t need expert realize highly infectious virus done us. People deny pretend doesn’t exist long time. key learning adapt push forward seems limited people capable of. Travel destination spend 14 day quarantine,why would travel general mindset obedience New Zealanders Americans quite different hope wife going okay financially. Trump’s useful idiot! Yes, good point one used make every time discussed issue. remmeber always make point itøs red flag necessarily damn account anything. 

One look aspects well, discourse pattern. Another big red flag account constantly using ad hominems. Ofc also organic, people cranky ofc lol! 

Still, see couple red flags together, good bit cautions. Eh posted late night CCP members active. can’t post truth country’s government they’re asleep without bombarded downvotes Pandemic? Pssh past that, blood, time anarchy. 😩👌💦 comparisons completely possible two countries, logic weird Sweden is, main comment, compared Nordic Balkan countries? Especially Balkan ones, similar way, reminiscent eastern European countries it’s gotta someone else’s fault!!! Seeing articles kinda make upset. want respect pandemic, want best humanity, can't stop going work? support decision wholeheartedly:) (Fauci) personally lied public month February March mask wearing telling wear masks, public doesn’t think it’s important wear masks.

He’s done good things he’s complicit disaster federal response. Firstly exhale carbon dioxide I'd take anything person said fat grain pink Himalayan salt 😉 they're another thing carry like going die damp. dry out. I'm engineer literally living STILL found boring... Sounds like live warm place can't freeze death getting wet. He’s probably quarantining stupidity 2020. Also Asia. It’s annoying take precautions, ventilation, closing machines, sanitizing regularly, mask policy, etc. people wear mouths noses out. Completely defeats purpose. Hospitals empty, bleeding red ink laying workers. hardest hit areas like NY never used field hospitals never ran ventilators. else waiting for? vaccine? never plan. managing lol. infection numbers tripled today. hospitalizations deaths either. Many long term damage simply got infected either without symptoms None countries' situation control yet. know someone failed medical school. got medical degree Caribbean I'm suprised changed mind want go. 
I gotten impression British usually cheerfully choose leave disaster zone without solid plan all. Usually also trying drag unwilling Scottish people along ride. 
Then again, atleast old pudgy gnarly-blond-haired right-wing uncompassionate lunatic leading country like U.S. Yeah minister interior crying Finland Norway keeping borders closed Sweden. wonder /s. country give shit elderly population cost lot money. asked nurse phone symptoms get tested risk-group; ""There tests. Stay home.""  haven’t explained it’s ‘major discomfort’ wear piece cloth lighter clothes anyway wear. 

I'm could million reason, may weight. people like chocolate, people hate wear mask pandemic comes dick, personal preference

Then people prefer wear mask, dick. define personal preference Nobody ‘wants’ wear mask, adult put it

So self centered, thinking everyone think like you.

Likewise wanting people want wear mask wear mask affect either.

For people wearing mask hugely inconvenience, thing, sorry.

Similarly, trying force wear mask even though want bunch dicks. live neighborhood - know him, people posting facebook. 

There's video leaving hospital light rehab house. Covid took toll otherwise active father. Dude looks like different person, know lot simply ventilator sedation/coma, let warning need virus do. 

There lot angry mask-deniers city - dense city (you could probably rooftop jump houses half mile hit gap big jump). 

And he's 43. 

Take seriously. can't believe we're 3 months serious shit 5 months shit US, people still knuckleheads this. Change 'anyone' 'most' remove 'anymore' entirely right. Depends laws restrictions currently place man. I’m Clemson student contact someone whose roommate Covid workplace. waiting test results, showing major symptoms virus. month ago less ten cases Greenville surrounding areas, since downtown areas opened, hearing cases pop small college town known reputable bar restaurant closing it’s doors. expect in-class lectures football season fall semester early openings. shutdown March May showing pointless day day Sweden then... Based data? ""The website added Arnold's exit meant political stance — simply concerned other's safety."" 

WHY FUCK EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED. Mask wearing political, clarified. sad people confuse two. Let's forget mass grave dug Bronx April. US we'll COVID free weeks, I've heard.

- cannot make total lockdown society, appeal parties take responsibility. serious, Nieminen adds.

SVT Norrbotten reported yesterday infection spreading among elderly residents, units sick leave 70 percent.

Inside. think “leaves” acceptable...you’d walk gym whether worked not. left permanently, I’d think “quits” would better word. 

If absolutely go walking, I’d choose “walks on” famous gym. mean we've yellow 3 weeks now. Sadly, can't open article, get 'Access Denied' (May location, I'm Austria).

Could anyone provide summary something? would vey helpful. guy joined mass protests? There’s point wasting money. scientific backing. Please link some. I'll wait. color-coding phases best idea. People hear ""green"" automatically assume ""green means go"", restrictions/requirements off. fuck cares China thinks. due many Vietnam veterans troop reduction dissolution Soviet Union? Conservative response managing crisis incredibly inept. don’t deny Britain isn’t New Zealand, Boris isn’t Jacinda. Maybe couldn’t successful NZ could definitely successful were. I've seen handful within last week apartment complex. Dead ass I'm like rather quit job continue working point time, unsafe. already mold horror stories tell working Ross comes bio hazards pandemic. Multiple cases feces random spots floor, urine floor clothes, bitches putting numbers get fitting rooms mouths handing kids chew (then required take back gloves sanitizer provided)

Now stores opened (3 weeks) finally closed 2 stall padlocked bathroom public. finally clean. Finally diarrhea floor period Blood seats, actually enough toilet paper etc. suddenly everyone company like open bathrooms fitting rooms make employees clean bathrooms every hour hundreds mofos already abiding social distancing regulations cause ""need buy clothes"" going trapped non air filtered bathroom suddenly , who's asthma attacks since coming back work, clean behind disgusting women men? Noooo I'm paid enough janitor semi apocalypse. family's Rus need put danger again.

Boy get started there's dip shits opening petri dish gyms woooo need move middle woods definitely worried. We're told go back work end month, nearly every day worse last comes case counts, deaths, hospitalizations. Reopening schools fall going make things worse. Unfortunately, money businesses. advice someone pressured return work *explicitly wearing mask* ""our hospitalization numbers dropping""? I'm independent contractor job offer sick pay health insurance. Exercise scientist here: that’s thought behind them, really works practice. masks zero scientific backing, training hour two fake high-altitude conditions completely negated 22-23 hours day spend normal oxygen conditions. blame Gov Abbott refusing insure public safety met first profits second. Gyms may shared contact points, depending someone doing, there's lot social distancing happens naturally far equipment spread out.  machines six feet diameter already, folks spend 5-10 minutes given weight equipment. Wipe thoroughly using it.

Weight racks treadmills, someone hangs longer period time, people closed other, sound bit dangerous.  actual job pass strict anti-pandemic laws? looking moving Canada US years ago. husband offered job significant pay raise cost living increased salary difference would living like kings. would total financial freedom. 

And started talking kids, education system, health care guns. decided stay put grateful good sense everyday. 

We even stepped foot States since shortly Trump took office. moment scared left people wearing masks. I’m glad wasn’t case. Beating dead horse here, people AZ don’t give shit anymore aren’t wearing masks, social distancing, going crowded bars clubs etc. real “survival fittest” attitude going on. Aren’t rumblings they’re going announce whether Oxford vaccine good go next day so?

That news going put really great really depressed mood depending outcome. banned state state travel can’t blame residents Arizona every week I’ve new friends town wish joking there’s coming way 4th July Arizona open everyone pouring in. Maybe ban state state travel unless it’s strictly business emergency. gov close old town seems main problem. Everyone wants party Scottsdale lol. looks like lot sick possibly dying young people. hey, money. thought would take longer see two Uhauls two PODS street today. moving. mom severe anxiety. tries avoid wearing mask often causes panic attack due limited capacity breathing. still wears forced to. Deaths going keep declining. seen worst yet. protests, rallies, people bucking quarantine, etc. gonna get much worse. 11 days 210% average 5 day incubation period. plausible alone, documented cases, infection would show last possible days. I'm done nice here.

Let go rallies, infect other, go home, infect families. May many die possible. can't vote shitheel they're dead. Could something morons chiefs refusing masks dude 3 months ago. prob bro. Funny af. Like nurses smoke. can’t explain it’s major discomfort? Lol

I like chocolate people hate chocolate ? could many reason, I'm person hate chocolate, can't feel feeling chocolate. know exactly like chocolate force prefer chocolate. prefer wear mask” isn’t real thing

What mean real thing ? plenty people like that. self centred expect adults act like adults, clearly struggle with

Which adults? Every adult different. Clearly struggle adults think alike.

And cry people wear mask, dick too. People took seriously followed recommendations helps. Politics aside Aussies mostly reasonable. suspicions subreddit full leftists.  Probably cares Swedish brigade downplay everything... backdated errors actual deaths yesterday 300 something.

You're damn site better us UK moment. guys per capita deaths us youd 800,000 deaths around 20,000 day! confirm also view Ireland. doubt. live Twin Cities place blame Trump.

Several cities requirement persons must wear mask public. governor overrode rule stated cities cannot force people wear masks. seeing highest cases ever he's blaming local officials enough. joke. People downvoting point fallacy/hypocrisy. point. trump rallies bad BLM protests good? 

Seems like double standard me. public gatherings effective treatment vaccine? true, Trump list way bigger others  article two Clemson football players basketball player tested positive virus. However, likely survive virus, stuck lung damage may affect futures sports. Considering players close proximity other, outbreak happens within team season, losing many players virus likely forfeit. 

The majority revenue generated small businesses come influx people coming sporting events town especially football fall. small businesses taking large hit closures since small business bailouts government small business loan. expect many businesses permanently close doors year change dynamic town many alumni students love. guess focus “facts”, cling feel righteous indignation. 

Can guarantee everyone experience mild symptoms? seems projecting severity experiences brave souls everyone else expect fortunate enough catch virus. 

You presented nothing “fact” based all. course not! wouldn’t fit narrative! I’ve Gibraltar country 20x smaller city live in. Yes, are. Requiring masks public. Testing tracing. excused pirate. Arrr. Judgement Day inevitable Florida government’s mix messages Covid altogether DeSantis’ fault entirely Whatever want say Arnold, man knows value leading example. comparing risk dying C-19 risk US soldiers dying combat Iraq Afghanistan.

I comparing risk people Iraq Afghanistan dying C-19 risk dying hands US military. 

Either comparsions relative neither are.  lives equal. disproportionate number lives taken specific cause. 

Your argument keeps moving goal post. First, WWI-era lives matter 3.25 less them, it’s impact society greater. But, took 4.4 time reach milestone WWI, accounting that, greater loss life present day society. 

So, second reason spread Covid19, wondering. But, made relative argument bringing size population. 

You get that, right? point 3.25 people now. So, it: lives matter relative? ad hominems dash begging question. that's call bad faith! Hard disagree. 2-3 meters wiping surfaces going adequately protect indoor gym people working intensely. good ventilation is, anything. Breathing heavily without mask confined space that's poorly ventilated extended period time going make people sick even 2-3 meters apart wiping surfaces. Yeah mean doesn’t mean less wrong it.

We humans tend biased way incapable seeing villains anything good competent, heroes anything bad incompetent. BLM protestors think it’s apparently Well US, went back work three weeks ago, that's governor idiot hosting rnc. Except it’s really 1/100 that’s average across age ranges. Saying 1/100 chance dying contract Covid pretty misleading. That's completely different thing know it.


They told citizens dying relatives. told UNTESTED foreigners heavy hit country could go dying relatives.


That situation, fact people UK New Zealand safe say compassion WORSE person. One side got compassion, others didn't.  8 10 Americans think first wave over. It’s not. Omfg must record. Tell protestors main campus average around 45,000 students within 2 mile square campus. already seeing cases going (small still increasing) want know fall looks like. Thats true except case... half listen ones want keep states closed. half causing phase pandemic ones align him. People spent 3 months home stir crazy joke, explains lot well lol 50% tests positive. real number probably multiple one. sad watch Bolsonaro kill people. enough money home gym. sure would even show public gym pandemic. Aussie stuck India pandemic. 8 really surprised lucky got. Barely restrictions. Schools opening again. Scott Morison barely lockdown got lucky. article covid numbers. clear enough reference covid hospitalizations. Seems like want whine perceived nits rather discussing substantive issue, I'll leave pointless complaining.  something foolish. Made mistake. amusing reading comments relentlessly blasting people, never done something foolish lives regretted it. morons, idiots, Floriduh, etc. Pretty fucking lame. American, fed healthy diet pro-US propaganda growing up, fuck happened.

Did watch disaster movie propaganda did? 

1.	The US rocking free world, people eating cheeseburgers, listening Aerosmith, fucking hot chicks.
2.	Some smarty smart pants chilling science place when, bloop bloop bloop, what’s that, uh oh, thankfully someone programmed software pop giant message, Disaster Detected: 26 hours 42 minutes 15 seconds goes boom, countdown animation starts, science dude rushes car.
3.	Driving fast dialing phone trope, “Get three-letter acronym government agency address problem”
4.	Science dude, general dude, director lady meet three letter acronym, bold plan devised.
5.	Throw away seen nations impotently pleading big daddy USA USA USA save day
6.	Macho-profession man rough around edges one pull bold plan

11. Earth saved

Independence Day, Armageddon, Deep Impact, Outbreak, every disaster movie last 30 years followed rough plot outline.

Here though, science person telling us asteroid hurtling towards earth, Bruce Willis character shouting fake news chugging bleach... roll credits. That's amazing... think could rent couch price... like they're blaming workplace people's actions leave said workplace. Roughly 50 75% usage stores places like subway.

Maybe 2 10 wear one outside near others, that's mostly paranoia required.

Spread really indoors cramped areas people interacting close quarters. beach front property going cheap soon? I'm honestly shocked. would've thought protests would've caused huge spark cases, even effect. Strange. 

But I'm complaining. *whispers* currency already ruined, need bleach. 

Too soon? fair, she’s paying $60k year herself. roommate, she’s probably paying like $30k year. 

That said, someone lives NYC - $2500/month live roommate is... lot. Especially grad student. NYU students know pay closer $1500/month 2br within walking/biking distance school. could probably get $1200/month commute train. Rent expensive here, especially West Village, *damn* must living nice building. could easily get nice studio pretty decent 1br kind money.

In experience best negotiating power building people stay longest. buildings would rather long term renters pay consistently deal high turn rates. restricting quantities, still amounts thing.

In local real estate market, low inventory, realtors I've talked think much impact. 2008-2009 area Midwest saw property prices basically stagnant growing. Real estate trends super localized even huge national events going on.

Do pathogens phone keyboard typing bedroom?

You naive believe dont encounter pathogens daily life Pfft.

South Korea. Compare contrast.

South Korea 5 times population Sweden. South Korea also lock down. South Korea took aggressive approach testing, tracing isolating infected.

End result? South Korea 1/4 number cases, 1/18 number deaths Sweden.

Even take lock downs picture (yeah, know, would Constitution Sweden...) Sweden horrible job.

Simply telling infected isolate themselves, without bothering test trace contacts means basically strategy all.

They (secretly) relying herd immunity hoping would sort out.

And ""strategy"" failed miserably. Disengaging do. would take much time explain basic science reasoning behind it, already dont basic understanding age either stupid willfully ignorant. arent going receptive new information anyways. would wasting time.

I'm sure data publicly available somewhere, check out. Like jobs insurance, best way get good rate change. fun moving, companies always take advantage don't. Really?

Better truly random representative sample

That said, think unfortunately take lot overcome distrust Tuskegee, rightfully Depends State. Michigan failing issue renewal lease implies contract continued similar commitment before, far tenant occupation goes. think still leave month month though. apartment downtown Omaha rented $550 month. time left seven years later rent $620 month. Ten dollar increase year. [Pandemic key points article are:

- Based pattern spread 14 different influenza pandemics past 500 years, *there little evidence support likelihood second third lethal wave H1N1 influenza*.
- term “wave” entered common use influenza pandemic spread Asia 1889. 1890 1894 many four annual, seasonal peaks mortality flu reported main pandemic passed.
- 1918 influenza pandemic thought killed 50 million people worldwide. However, *there little evidence outbreak started first wave milder illness followed second, deadly wave virus mutated transmissible virulent form.*
- also *little convincing evidence* 1957 1968 pandemics support idea viruses start relatively mild turning lethal mutations. bravado before. hospitals start filling up, choice unless wants face revolution. evidence work political.

Statutory policy responses evidence political.

It's good remember dichotomy. one day increase ever ""troubling."" overall agree AZ bad shape right now. think find average trend lower coming years.  bit dated, 50% deaths calculated rising. So, read bit, saw trend line counted isn’t reality, moved on. 

The White House predicting 200,000 deaths October. bit far out, let’s look little closer, say July. July 4th, June 12th. 

We still haven’t peaked. wars compare years long. Even WWI 580 days US involvement (then stayed Europe around another 2 years). Deaths per day, seeing time average per day WWI 4.4. But, midst first wave, number could drastically change next 400+ days reach days WWI. 

The likely average continue older Americans. professional athletes impacted, healthiest individuals planet. 

I’m saying let’s shut things down, little reason much acknowledge Americans died died WWI realistic think surpass American deaths WWII next years. 

Unlike wars though, deaths much likely largely preventable, especially deaths happened yet. really hard compare two situations based positive tests, little testing done around March 22nd NY. ratio actual cases tested positive cases probably magnitudes higher NY Texas now. 

I suspect R0 lower Texas New York NYC, unless population Texas makes rapid behavioral changes NY time, probably long opposite. arent wearing masks. University Pennsylvania quit stalking ya dumb freak Tracing contacts testing great maybe 300 cases state citizens cautious contact. climbing toward 3,000 citizens largely defiant precautions (packing beaches &amp; bars, etc) viable. 

I agree corona months. know people 99% got visiting Disney Feb. Yeah. went protest town, 90% people masks personally made sure stay near back socially distanced chanting near front. Went Saturday I'm still monitoring case. goes ways. tenant looking places calls bluff says oh increase budget, I’ll moving out. landlord minimal time find new tenant potentially empty apartment pandemic. protest minor issue compared reopening.

Please understand that. one side Americans.  others traitors.  counted? One correction, self funded plans frequently carrier serve stop loss well, company ever hook total premium Aetna would cover anything beyond that. generally true small medium businesses. [what somebody needs Greg Abbott right point? Fauci talking misrepresented mask efficacy : Interesting source, thank you!! thread here? Got link? fix that. antibody test results representative.....big yikes. suggests 2 million exposed. definitely American thing. part Christian culture literally since beginning, long United States ever country. Long New World ever discovered. Blame local politicians voting increase taxes every year. i'm still alive, got Lmao one adhering social distancing anymore. think there's gonna revolution demanding it? body process? absorbed intestinal tract. silver ions..

And? Again, body process. Yes, body take silver. question was, process exists body utilizes silver? body silver would ""help body immune system"" claimed? point ways vitamin C &amp; utilized human body comparison. silver.

Let's specific information. Let's sources. think Amy Acton resigned Ohio reason. Sweden issue state guidance isolate seniors. problem made recommendations voluntary.  reason

Oh hell no. decision leave schools open literally killed teachers. Non senior deaths population centers (eg Stockholm) among worst world. failed every level stuck hell US much Asia Europe reopening tiny fraction loss life.

""Because would long."" manager flying Texas ATL Monday making whole team go lunch. Lol wild ""Football"" meant ""soccer"" two bedroom, 960 square foot apartment Brooklyn 3 stops Manhattan $2,000 month. Well, ever visited would know huge difference hospital nursing home. Nursing homes staffed long term residents much lower acuity. pretty standard 1:10+ ratio CNAs higher nurses. hospital much staff ratio usually 1:1 higher acuity areas, like ICU. Hospitals also typically employ RNs nursing home LPNs. RNs education typically training. seem like probably think know all, though, I'll let continue spread bullshit. *because medical condition exists* 

Youre literally defending people's ability lie disabled get something reason dont feel like it. 

You know whats worse ableism? Committing fraud pretending disabled special treatment. kind huge ""fuck you"" people legitimate handicaps actually require special accommodations. believe everyone worn masks correctly consistently distanced two complete months, novel coronavirus would completely gone away now? would possible? ""If stop testing right now, we’d cases, any” TX FL able hide excess deaths bookkeeping forever. Five days federal minimum? stares better protections. Sigh. wonder NYC last saw September still exists ever again. Deflation...I think things get cheaper stay flat awhile. people understand many people ... die?

54,000 week US. Every week. every month.

We're 110,000 four+ months near-unchecked spread virus without vaccine. 

Context, people. one bedroom $400-600 month

Based what? took ideas. Never heard 1000 befor yang. Right. Like point loaded gun head pull trigger... Oops, I'm dead. Murphy's Law, amiright?  Good question.

Since masks 100% effective contagious without symptoms.....it really matter. Lock room proven vaccine developed. 

Now hear Stanford Researchers ""lock down"" nothing save lives. High school likely since everyone afford college. US federal guidance start, countries, global pandemic. However, also think Agent Orange charge maybe saved lives. Arizona 42k known cases. Assuming 50% asymptomatic rate 50% symptomatic people tested (to estimate upper band), AZ would 168k known cases, 2.3% chance endemic. 1400 big apartment considered cheap...? ridiculous. can't build way problem either - new units vulnerable used AirBnB, standing empty act safety deposit box overseas capital outflows, used offices creative agencies - building fuel speculation. 

In city, think dozen record labels, agencies, publishers least 2 homes: one work of, one use parties visiting executives. set New York, L.A., often Portland Austin Nashville well. 

These residences never show official vacancy figures, however, vacancy rates capture homes sale available rent - homes lack full time resident. can't even imagine high real vacancy rates are. from? take data directly Public Health Agency Sweden

From Public health agency's press is, almost exactly growth rates so-called ""flattened curve"".

So took detailed graph showed made exact conclusion before, even categorized data. clearly clue looking at. cannot compare growth rate two time periods clear latter increase due increased testing mild cases. data severe cases right still unable see ""severe"" ""mild"" cases... exactly counting mild cases even testing people unless ""seriously ill"" part ""at risk"" group?

They testing healthcare workers truth simply counting cases lead ""flattened curve"" obvious chart based data Public Health Agency... chart.

There literally evidence points towards this. saying virus mutated suddenly turned less severe? Cause that's explanation misinterpretation data.

There half many severe cases peak. nothing discuss wrong according relevant published even investigation people denied treatment, even apparently plenty beds available

Are aware concept palliative sorry trust Intensive Care numbers accurate representation spread disease Sweden. people denied treatment reason age, aged likely need treatment, numbers actually receive mean nothing.

The numbers line every statistic, like severe cases, hospitalizations deaths. ground stand got owned graph Swedish media articles. wonder prefer comment bullshit.

Big issue isn’t people turning houses year. It’s people aren’t comfortable sell people sitting houses waiting, maybe waiting next year. knows. hillary comes across horribly completely fake. thats it. trust 80% ""what see get"" lot people. people thini get Hillary lying, cheating, backroom dealing estalblishment front fake smiles empty words. fact seems competent makes threatening. Sociopaths like it. blame refusing wear masks public dumbasses well. yes Abbott primary person take blame Texas. . surprised number daily Covid deaths USA steadily decreased continues downward trend despite not-locking-down, protests, re-opening would expect less you, Florida. anyone tested positive corona virus..and recovered almost 100% start feeling sick around day 17 18? don’t know caught cold corona coming back. Anxiety roof probably isn’t helping.  Thats tge weird part, 40 million work, current renters take hit people work. grew Bay Area lived San Francisco last year knew someone cheap sublet. It’s common knowledge don’t make $100k/year minimum, can’t live comfortably unless special circumstance. 

No one city making $45k/year unless 12 roommates “diamond rough” situation hookup.

Thank tech companies ruining best city ever. think true. see dashboard tab ""Total cases"", 82,719. next tab lists ""Total People Tested"" 1,486,759. see reports total number tests. Looks like people positive / people tested. virus care. care getting together fight injustice watch baseball. spread that's does.

Now, say important protest get together personal purposes, get support science. get claim side ""science deniers"" always accept facts. rational; rationalizing. America, sue. That's way life Americans. *gasp* Fwiw usually avoid rent increases pretty easily saying ""we're moving cheaper alternatives area things like move-in bonuses, would renew pay more?""

Literally every time went approach, either got rental increase, free 1-2 months rent.

And doubt, move.

Landlords increasing rent understandable. Landlords offering 2 months free people moving in, INCREASING RENT, red flag signal find new place. ‘The military’. even read article? There’s one guy put charge overseeing reviewing procedures. He’ll resources needs. ‘the military’ mostly peacekeepers. That’s we’re ‘shrieking’ put it. RemindMe! October 1 That’s true insurance jobs, always felt like renting operated like cartel. could swear calculate much moving expenses are, raise rent exactly much every year won’t move place even matches current rent expense moving swamp gains save rent. I’ve never found anywhere CHEAPER rent am. 🤣 bad I'm s.f. born raised. living vallejo ca past 7 years B.c. priced out. see glimmer hope returning city work family friends. cut 1.5 hr commute fro. 54,000 people die every week US, context. Important. I've heard Ohio, places got hit harder early like Cleveland trending parts trending up. like many states big city drives numbers masks smaller outbreaks (e.g. Los Angeles CA). really checked maybe tell there's truth it.

I think right outside part, least one factor. predicted spring break surge never really happened. Protests seemed change general trends, least yet. Outdoor transmission always question mark among scientists despite click bait pictures outdoor gatherings. ""Someone personally know, maybe even they're really old.""

/s they’re wrong. damn fault, right? yes let’s isolate years. also, someone going work interacting people there, whats harm interacting small group friends? CDC literally said groups 10 fine. used live SF knew pain NYC. yea knew SoCal increasing too. least get better amenities hundred year old buildings. said ""a dine-in restaurant necessary."" 

Which true. else life actually necessary? Honest question. want take responsibility stupid decision. live area low viral presence right leave go work (I work hospital's ICU, COVID cases 4 days!), grocery store, pharmacy. wear masks everywhere home. wear gloves pharmacy grocery store. want upswing cases... watching people ICU dying agonal breathing. suffocating nothing. end day, illness pandemic comes throw constitutional rights window""

They get lost. Masks seem help massively. anti lockdown come, masks seem key getting us mess.

People may constitutional right wear mask. People also human right live life see fit. can't live dead. wear fucking mask. Desantis misrepresenting info. surprise!! guys buy rent high? info available m² way cheaper Western Europe lower rents.
Doesn't help greedy space course live larger city places I've seen go month month least upcharge (they prefer yearly renewal income steadier). Currently I'm paying extra $100 month want move partner able 2 months. Totally legal far know. becomes seasonal, ajust? lockdown three months every year, treatment found? Maybe high school college credit part required course ethics. lease another 2 years. fuck I'm getting pandemic renegotiation. Remember people looked Indians chasing healthcare workers back April comments about, ""man India backwards savage, people unscientific crazy""?

Now someone tell ANYONE CNN orchestrate yet ""virtuous"" super spreading events... Says much article. get downvoted.

\-Edit got downvoted! Good luck. SF 2Bed/1BA $4k/month apartments built 1910 (before WWI), still looks like 100 years old. Yes blame people media putting information. Makes sense. Wow! Australia emerged COVID Crisis gained admiration 3 reasons.

1. Enforcing strict lock saving citizens infection, country track elimination sports activities within borders resume normal basis. 
2. Closing borders Tourism 2021 - thus putting value citizens lives money. going hurt, priorities right.
3. Standing China regarding origin COVID-19. Almost like David, battling Goliath. first push issue backed down. national courage looks like - willingness suffer economic pain principle. that's case, landlord increasing $10 month, $100, routine. Good. many cities keep building commercial real estate empty space throughout city. Phoenix full shopping centers built across street empty shopping centers. Iran's initial spike March, may hot legally enforceable anyway, like someone never prove single business definitely caught giant waste time.

Not average Joe idea enforceability contract.

It may help win lawsuit, likely prevent one first place. Lmao Airlines cutting alcohol they've wanted long time. good number flyers would choose another airline announced policy.  excuse. `Way future` WTO defines dumping. dont think dont? That's reason occurs goods exported price less normal value, generally meaning exported less sold domestic market third-country markets, less production cost.


It dumping goods like steel years. Countries putting extra tariffs PRC trying skirt via intermediary countries. Texas, Dallas area, see though go grocery store every 2 weeks, anywhere else yet. I'm staying home, right thing people care about. wear mask I'm store, I've found going right close gets quickly run many people - least neighborhood. wearing mask nightly late walks (around 2 am) really see anyone then, said hello distance crossed street distancing. guess good neighborhood. I'm lucky far work home, though business (I company) okay. reliable source? talking folks like Newsom Roy Cooper, got hands forced, Evers well. Honest question here, wearing mask I’m getting food drive through? typically don’t wanted know others doing. Half million guess tipping point is. Maybe 350,000 distribution right. also including antibody tests test total, despite fact antibody test never generate “positive” infection result. little troubling, I'm going need one case start getting alarmed. vaping cannabis 14 years tolerance breaks. Luckily kids wife stress there. need stop sedentary piece shit time. fault know is. Sometimes action easy take. I've come back depression, need bounce back weight gain. That's pretty awesome. BK? Fortunately unfortunately, PDX rise long coronavirus. probably looking attractive people still cool before. live? two bedroom apartment costs twice that. Yeah it’s six figure mark. Want sell 600k? GONE INSTANTLY, 700, 800, still sold slower, 900, give two months. 1 mil dot? Six months least. It’s mental barrier too. Every place different zone people full stop comfortable pool afford already small.  Wait wasn’t goats for?  That’s get owning money goes towards something blazing furnace U impeach confidence? got multiple friends NYC paying 3500 studio one bedroom. I’m curious see rent drops. public meeting Orange County Board Supervisors, Leigh Dundas, anti-vaccination attorney, **gave intimately personal details Quick, boyfriend’s name home address,** Cal Matters needs fired,” Dundas told held outside Quick’s home sheriff announced would enforce order, SFGate reported. **Dundas also threatened invite residents work Quick’s front yard masks** passed out, according Cal Matters.

What actual fuck? didn’t make claim deleted, saying 600k cases/day yesterday. seem correct you? Hard spend money quarantine Yachts billion dollar doomsday bunkers. took occasion reinstitute job search requirements Unemployment.

Not even joking. gonna get even worse. tell covid check global stats 800 employees employed directly GOAA, balance work employers, airlines, concessionaires, ramp crew, contractors etc. happen link name, author groundbreaking game changing study would you? side? mask sufficient solution, every country would done that.

It's not. know authorities use death counts track viral prevalence right? use live numbers like hospitalizations ICU occupation. paid little rent 1 bedroom nearly 20 years. shitty apartment great part Houston area.

Where living things cheap 2020? universal basic income would last longer media discourse. spending habits really hope take pandemic, society. Eating less, spending money things like bars movie theatres. house started baking muffins rather buying them, it\`s healthier cheaper. loved store bought muffins, surprised found walking without second thought. They\`re part life anymore. think lot casual careless spending stopped. 


There\`s also habits hope don\`t take forward. There\`s lot isolationist moves (understandably, pandemic!) community sharing way go lot things. don\`t need private pools, set tools, anything use rarely. concerns viruses, worry balance going tip people\`s minds towards hoarding supplies. are, however show people think corona serious virus prove wrong.

For example chance healthy person 30 dying Covid-19 infected less chance dying driving test centre. Soon announced smaller seat sizes. know, make middle seat keep empty. mean, serious enough leave fly private, probably home middle hunkered down. people leave hot zones, equipped stay fuck society. would anyone ever sign new lease rent increase?  cases keep increasing could turn city carch virus....thats huge problem tourist town never said herpes virus. Herpes also virus hides nervous system. HIV also. chickenpox. 

Supposedly hepatitis C also hide non-liver cells go dormant years also. (People ""cured"" it, later receiving liver transplant come back years later.)

I'm virologist I'm expert. I'm saying SARS-CoV-2 hides like others, scale 1-10, would level 10 bad did.... that, worth keeping eye anyone tests positive especially early learning stages virus. likely viral fragments still triggering highly sensitive PCR test, much cost harm involved additional followup tests occasion. (Especially since regular followups people virus keeping eye long term issues.) Right, live Ohio. pay move Ohio. Yeah well rent went took away trash service door dumpster painted entire complex ugly 2 tone

It’s mountain mole hill, many respects. think devolving, actually! ideas currently normal established century less. nuclear family single home idea came fifties, normal humans. think right. airlines flying? might need fly work next couple months given news stories people taking masks plane, I'd love know airlines enforcing rule. Tomato Jones Rosemary’s Baby happy others naming plants talk later Probably took occasion reinstitute job search requirements Unemployment.

Not even joking. Well said. think emphasis masks beginning rather locking everything would found much sustainable place right now. Unfortunately think one cases know know information kept swinging back forth saying masks were/weren't effective. think would reduced transmission 60 80% like Nations practice kind procedure did. go cdc's coronavirus dashboard look places like South Korea New Zealand many Asian Nations used using masks regular flu pandemics. death rates per capita far lower. gone, raging two months ago. got PTSD style flashback apartment shopping Manhattan reading this. Spot on. *i can’t quit you, reddit...* sharp increase what? Daily reported numbers? relevant? call 0 figure last sunday sharp decrease? nah slowly going see here

 arguement disagreed psychology study boy downvoted. Yes, it’s like event adjusted due outbreak highly contagious virus anything like that. 

I’m glad changed tune, throwing around lot threats hit wallet. Haven’t ever heard issue mea culpa either. battle huge! bad Neanderthals lost. Number daily deaths continues decrease! Constant uninterrupted steady improvement since generally courteous.

I define courteous. I've flew 7 times last 2 months.

There strategy. That's point. ""Do nothing"" strategy, lack strategy. nothing worked exactly expected - resulted many cases deaths herd earth flat either

No shit, Sherlock... first bringing South Korea?

Because logic weird Sweden is, main comment, compared Nordic Balkan countries?

So gave comparison involved Asian country. even chose one also lock population.

I mean, obvious going - country compared Sweden... unless terribly. case, regardless location, demographics strategy, ""good comparison"".

Apparently cohort, nations failed contain virus compared Sweden.

Which rather strange group *want* in... mean, saying goes, real-estate location.

Also, things dangerous necessities (going hospital heart attack, getting groceries, etc). 

The choice ""go dangerous things unnecessary"" ""Let's holed rooms fed like hamsters rest lives."" people would morons. even read wrote? People take want others see post online.

/r/selfawarewolves live Orange County, CA. placed mask mandate May 23. week straight, former Chief Health Officer received pushback Board Supervisors public. even received death threats public. believe resignation result pressure difficult keep right thing. 

Prior mask mandate rescinded, started petition - [change.org/mask-up-OC](www.change.org/mask-up-oc). started petition feared mask mandate would get rescinded - that’s exactly happened. 

What concerns opponents mask mandate saying (which appears based conspiracies false information). Rather, appears they’ve rescinded mask mandate result opponents saying. things opponents saying - 

As leaders county, look right thing. right thing, case, use facts govern community - conspiracy theories baseless arguments.

I, along many others, going speak Board Supervisors June 23. signatures have, even beyond county lines, impact effort make.  fair amount people literally think virus type hoax. idea come reason people would think actually believe this. Others still stick narrative worse flu. Especially young people dont think susceptible. often people think earth flat voted Donald Trump. 

I think large part comes lack knowledge rest world. pay attention typical american media outlets rarely give much insight happening around world outside country. education system gives hardly history outside states. learn american history us influence world wars etc. maybe basic touch major events like french revolution etc even applies Europe. Coupled fact country big different kinds landscapes many people travel within country. 

I think explains least big part many americans live bubble thinking different superior everyone else. literally concept life like countries. dont follow world events idea virus rest world. know see hear american media friends / family social media. see health care system overwhelmed right front dont think issue. dont comprehend gravity situation think virus ""over"" never existed first place. dont bother learn situation concerned day day lives. 

Of course, majority americans concerned things like this. minority large enough cause problems, they're large enough put Donald Trump office. yes, lot stupidity lack critical thinking problem solving skills. I'm sure common. Even concerned much global knowledge impact American bubble isnt much knowledge reality life parts world contributes idea thinking americans better different rest world. dont think change much world history taught school curriculums media pays focus world events, maybe international travel becomes common.

New Zealand hardly ""outbreak"".  2 returning travelers test positive caught cases screening. hilarious thing - Christians desperate pray together fancy circumstances, rather alone, privately, EXACTLY opposite Jesus told do:

""And thou prayest, thou shalt hypocrites are: love pray standing synagogues corners streets, may seen men. Verily say unto you, reward.""

So, church-going covid cases literally hypocrites despised entity claim worship!

I find absolutely laughable thing. got Covid - rather way got infected inherently angers deity working please. Asshats. large gatherings first place?? Indefinitely, soul care people die. numbers cares $$$ Kinda think political theatre beginning. Asking produce effective vaccine well make available mass quantity small time frame pipe dream get go. Saying it’ll happen track sure good feeling story people rally behind though  Device fingerprinting temporary 30% mis-correlation rates even provider IP. Assuming can’t access cookies/private data run nefarious scripts. that's easy! Medical professionals without N95 masks nursing homes strict quarantine protocols since January.... there, 60% deaths avoided. 

If &lt;90 IQ dumb know this, eggheads didn't? like repeat history here. Sometimes genuinely wonder literally situation we're in. Unlimited power exchange damning many people possible.  Good them! That’s joke, yes. maybe complete breakdown society. still shocked none trumps inner circle yet. Abbott = Two-faced Texan. panders lies. Exactly. yet, almost everyone claim Didn’t Texas Lt Governor say would rather old folks die rather effect economy?!? Seems like shouldn’t mad young people, thanking stimulating economy quietly dying!! already quaratine seeing full 14 days.

I believe so. govt yet acknowledge community transmission

Because India community spread, acknowledge major cities phase

Chennai, Mumbai Chennai major cities like Ahmedabad phase places make best 5 10 percent India. 

90 percent India community spread India community Heck even prime minister yet face media since pandemic began (he done total 0 press conferences unscripted interviews since coming power 2014)

I want know anything Pandemic. mentioned Modi never gives pressers. see needs one nown afrer all. mean many getting though, really matter spreading?  80% lifetime. However, 20% population US huge number. maybe whole Europe hoping Trump elected next season. guys see things like possibility crap pulled total jerk manages get tables turned? can't imagine single person voting him... That's *should* end / ended. think like can't come shit throw you, life, uh, finds way. longer free. Funny land actually get presented menu different hotels difference price levels, pay nicer place quarantine less want save cost.

Although test still free basic insurance China, Chinese nationals returning China overseas might have. 'Peak lizard brain' lol... I'll using one sure.

I guess I'm thankful careful community actually cares masks distancing tho.  That's actually really good question. No, SHOULD, in, feel morally ethically obligated to. thought knew that. didn’t realize many. point you’re ostracized following quarantine. That’s poor trend occurring doesn’t help many media outlets “influencers” pushing narrative. especially doesn’t help protest public health citing haircuts important lives people, another protest times doesn’t follow public health considered “backseat issue”. Churches death traps. Ah, wrong time make light things, see. indeed case kind seen. Cytokine storm causes damage due exaggerated immune response, saying caused COVID-19 (disease, virus) like saying pneumonia deaths caused COVID-19, either. It’s enough succeed – others fail. UK lot talk danger locking early, based scientific advice pp would lock long. Oh shit didn’t even notice thanks!

But also year people decided taking GF dinner worth Grans life waiters health life savings. (Assuming waiter America) We’re gaslighted. it. Device fingerprint temporary. store information server-side little restrictions cannot store based software using. information available, retrieve it.

You spoof anonymize, sure, plenty people idea even means. Nothing learned. agent hostile foreign power waging biological warfare. would anyone want assholes stop this? Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence, associated, please *DO* continue meeting large groups people US wearing mask. Patriotic duty!!

Please continue behavior everywhere go everyone meet! higher calling ""right"" side political position! Sad dude. due flying next week 4-week vacation. Love states, dumb folks sure. sound like one patting back think you’re smart, gotta say.  new clusters.

Which easily go online find reported on? 

This happens remove science decision making policies, sheep. see discouraging mask use. People opposed wearing mask talk like think wearing mask represents fear, really represents caring people's welfare. think people much less likely resent wearing mask see way, they're terrified people thinking they're afraid anything. Beijing cases hundreds, we’ve got cases tens thousands 40% flights Beijing crowded desire to, yes right, people allowed change minds anything. say it, stance rest life. It’s sort good news thought already past 200,000 deaths! Yeah, politics seem create much division days sadly. help so-called ""leader"" causes lot it. Even Spokane County, recent outbreak subsiding. I’m denier; thing deadly pandemic killed hundred thousand Americans kill many thousands more. I’ve pleasantly surprised even Eastern WA apparently cool wear masks except Costco, numbers still exploding. Mask implies ill, that's why. saying mock BLM protestors? ""for can't afford it"".

I hate country much. Oregon too! much empathy sometimes really wish could turn off. able see counselor since March. offered telephone/video appointments whatever reason, stress like 10x going talking person I've kind trying make due without. better initially said vaccine long way off, meaning sit lock vaccine ready, we'd get economy back running. Steroid use cause liver, kidney, heart problems- things attacked covid?

On top he’s large man 70s even fit large isn’t great life expectancy could least wear mask. rightfully so. Maybe Chinese unleash ANOTHER plague upon world, deep shut worldwide 

They forced pay every penny damages caused. mandatory quarantine incoming travelers, two managed evade qurantine IDK, point really think he's dumb enough believe he's tremendous beautiful catch it.

Or, conversely he's already it, sadly, desired effect.  think that's shocking tbh. I'm ""sue everyone"" person I'm US, putting someone family danger outrageous. 

She would prosecuted Spain I'm sure. quite strict privacy laws. case kind iirc mention due immune response called cytokin storm? Let’s hope do. stop fking going socialize! Smfh. forgot much jabs hurt. wish painless! necessarily put inject shot. well worth say. Literally every network news channel me. CBS, NBC, ABC. None ever seemed bothered potential health risks it. Heartless fuck. think people stealing american jobs. one going steal job McDonalds Bill. 

Name 1 white dude would want pick apples 100 degree minimum wage californian sun 10 hours, tell would want clean public restrooms. Certainly black people lol. Scrolled see someone would say something Sweden... live small town (less 3000 inhabitants), absolutely one ever respected social distance, since March seen one person wearing mask. went Stockholm yesterday, spent 4 hours walking city (I want use transport free time) saw exactly two persons wearing masks. one respecting social distance. Lot people clustered together parks, families babies close people.

Just like country, Sweden also share stupid people. I'm pretty impressed stupid people are. midsommar weekend, entire family elderly grandma wants go summer house days one seems understand still middle pandemic... Seattle. news, China widespread view water wet. Yup. U.S. failed state objective observer. Ha.

I'll sanitize hands putting on, I'll sanitize disinfect gloves go whatever I'm doing. point gloves much protect touching things, save hands directly washed/sanitized dozen times.

So yes, sanitize gloves properly, could cross contaminate, could cross contaminate bare hands sanitize hands properly.

If gloves break, throw away new pair, skin dry cracked, can't throw hands away.

Also, gloves take random bonus squirt sanitizer even disinfectant then. logic really hold never set plan long would take first place. assumed take long solve decided worth realized long actually was. revise history lie lack will/care others. Well guy WH thing reverse direction, throughout March April, so... economic bad news surely there, know it’s lesser two evils lord gonna catch I'm Spain said start would catastrophic US. taken bit longer expected though. Wear masks guys, work. would call ask normal doctor, least county testing anyone close contact known case. gyms. Im talking exercise mask make. Guess supposed make breathing difficult. sure helps though exercising lungs. Everyone needs wear mask! even amazing considering many people personally know someone died covid. Scotland, don’t see lot umbrellas bad virus doesn’t give crap 2020 campaign Oklahoman, would legit pay part salary host rally Saturday. terrified repercussions going be. Nope, everyone gonna pay stupid tax. Also PPP money restrictions it, designed used keep paying employees, check owner pocket. That’s nothing

I nearly shit pants saw Brazil 35k one day....

So probably 100k day really Americans NEED wear mask stop pandemic said doesn’t get paid gym? even arguing? even know point? really believes that, stop testing White House? location...you tell me...he gets paid show bro....and paid golds general. Probably younger people getting tested. reporting they're least tested based percentages, probably adequately show significant changes testing. way manipulate statistics make look worse are. You’re thread saying it’s joke, stock Golds Gym something? action Arnold’s triggering hard? *zing* Wait India new China? Nü Wave Arizona hospitals capacity? saying Trump taking life preparing exact moment! Ultimate long game! Deep cleaning counters won’t help. gotta deep clean customers coming disinfectant possibly injecting Yeah that's thing, can't labelled stupidity. Stupid thing expecting different result, everyone surely must know going make worse. superiority complex United States people seem drenched make believe different everyone else super interesting (as outsider, understand must suck surrounded it). global view. Chinese. wrong either. mean poor middle class. wealthy got PPP ran it. Honestly, dont let us come bsck til vaccine lol  assume you’re originally California since called “Cali”. Lecture president really want play joke, it’s Arnie making statement. He’s right making statement knows show people stands issue You’re solid 2 months since lockdown protests ([mid-April biggest ones Michigan, Texas Florida Arizona. Weird. 

I’m US, I’ve never flu vaccine take like 5 minutes. Usually get done whatever random pharmacy closest. boss denial. First ""Covid come here"". Next ""Even governor puts stay home order close"". came "" well closed two weeks"" denial every step. Funny jobs still closed! think that. believe shit. believe anything says. says thing votes. Nothing more. Arnold high risk age. 

He seems decent shape though. Think worst dudes went high school with, likely filled fake alpha tough guy nonsense. That's people White House now. Apparently Murphy guy's regular gets around lot. exactly? learn something Rob Manfred People keep saying China must lying, there's way huge population cases. Probabily kind overly dramatic reaction managed 80k cases across whole country? I’m quite sure you’re one arguing here. literally disagreed fact seem saying nowhere country improving, agreed rest statement. think need get sleep something.

First time that’s ever happened renting decade. think people saying vaccines ever work, rather vaccines exactly easy 100% foolproof, THAT... early rushed vaccines may confer 100% ""immunity"", vaccine provides good amount resistance, weakens symptoms may still provide long term lasting resistance.

Some common cold coronaviruses get again, since antibody resistance lasts months. LIKELY SARS-CoV-2? No.   way 2020 going, prepared possibility chunk population may get 5-10+ year resistance/immunity early vaccine.

No difference really Probably much need point. Still good Thank you. I'll look harder. We're still first wave spikes happen around events holidays. Memorial Day created spike. Protesting created spike. suspect 4th July create one. Ad Victoriam! Lol could downvoting this??? truly good news. Unless confirmed covid infection wear mask public (especially enclosed spaces). 
There might argument even recovered patients wear mask pretty quiet Illinois numbers going quite bit well, exception course GOP party members panties twist gathering restrictions suing.  reached peak reason far reason goes idiots. Thats POTUS bored longer exists Trumps negligence disgraceful soon former president indicted he's office? Could NYC completely shut protests therefore exponential spread take longer. lot places priests much faster bigger It’s possible anyways.

If case still seeing uptick positive coronavirus test results. 

NYC numbers falling precipitously. SO, works medical field, essentially said done stopped using masks cases. 

I hand, trying avoid returning office long humanly possibly spite management trying force us back in. problem that, company could work 100% remotely. Yet, somehow think forcing us back close quarters offices great idea.  I'm sorry country slowly dying. condolences. 

And I'm sorry living delusion. Ugh, yeah, kinda can’t refuse service. It’s weird. According management I’m supposed bend backwards even shop don’t mask. can’t refuse serve Lmao fucking what? They're ones losing money this, us. news outlets... Narcity?  get it... 4 years!? Ok. fun Trump rally Saturday. sure wear mask scream load it’s hoax Sorry Florida healthcare workers.... idiots?  guy's lobsters shit sound cool able deal weather.

I live San Diego fucking love it. That’s southern fatalism you. sympathy victims predatory economy long Covid-19 thing. I'm little skeptical sympathy comes ""Grandma's gotta die save economy"" people. Yeah. Could really simple blood type latest research correct.

I mean exactly new unexpected given original SARS virus behaved exactly It’s simple: tell get fuck refuse serve wear one. Man GOP convention corona bomb Jacksonville. could be? masks, social distancing, enclosed air conditioned building. mean that's asking right there. may common USA, normal healthy. Unless least 6'4"" bodybuilder, even 200lbs considered overweight terms BMI. Thinking 200lbs extreme ""thin"" ever right. 

Not trying shit you. fact accept kind lifestyle ""hey, happens"" - normal, average, everyday - fact many many Americans would agree really phased it... exactly 100 million Americans could high risk. Since first wave ended nothing fear. I’d probably pretend wasn’t happening invite bunch people neighbor’s house celebrate presidential campaign, telling bring fire extinguishers boss literally said, ""I've decided I'm done coronavirus "" today. call anything want, fact whatever want nothing it. Millions us ignoring mask requirement US Central PA. They’ll go get shotgun tell I’m violating rights Airborne means transmitted airborne particles remain infective time distance. speaks whether transmitted air. 

Why think it’s related it’s reproduction number? die COVID-19 twice happens rate he's putting original GoT material past 9 years. So, know ignorant lazy rural guy youtube never wears mask. says doesn’t like virus probably big deal. high-risk. really kind ignorant oblivious anything news.     
Today posts video mail received insurance company - sent mask hand-washing info sheets. seemed interested said mask, wear goes out.    
    
I’m wondering would people wearing masks handed/mailed one. Surprised gov hasn’t done this. gallows humor worried Texan. Sent sources explanation end another commenter. also found New York Times, paid send them. could go back share links well interested. still think there's chance Trump might throw Pence ""trash"" goes south. Crazy? Sure! 2020... Nothing surprises point. 1. can’t actually that.

2. lived OKC two years ago. might flights direct DTW, go Chicago anyways. ban could would effect.

Her statement grandstanding. Uh, yeah, that's China starting [test imported  protested online  may something there. 

Maybe needs mask won’t show makeup. Something looks tough. Maybe black leather little gold spikes... bar coronavirus test girl shooter belt full tests? fast?? love showed to
your thread prove right. Lockdown deaths already happening. Look India many migrant workers died long walk home shut shut trains down. died exhaustion trying walk hundreds miles home possessions backs income food were.

And disaster hasn’t happened yet doesn’t mean shouldn’t change course prevent happening. experts like UN, WFP tell us happen, people refuse believe happen, continue doing, like pulling Trump, credible organizations told kept doing, people would die Covid-19 dismissed looming threat. Imagine Trump saying January “sure people COULD die Covid,”... 

But isn’t 300k deaths predicting, 300k PER DAY!!

There aren’t millions deaths Covid yet globally, don’t think 500,000 yet. 25,000 daily cases coming somewhere new york new jersey. Arizona. confirm. I’m fine opening everything means stupid people go watch inside home..... 6 feet away go out. think realistic, even pessimistic. Yes please wear mask, wash sanitise hands constantly not, touch face without cleaning hands. help. wish keep safe. Take care. 9 10 Americans also waste time taking surveys. mall work at, stores still limiting number people allowed even though longer required. people crowd outside stores, right other, maskless. call corona conga lines. Alcoholism doesn’t care profession Thanks! know, keep hearing we'll know better two weeks, week week week...

At point, know better refusing learn. I'm dead yet! Trump rally Tulsa coming that. anyone still trying shit? Hasn’t completely debunked like thousand times?? local news still covering Coronavirus nonstop AZ. forest fires. could still millions deaths Eh happens. I've thin 200lbs much 400lbs middle school middle adult life. I've lost 100lbs 3 months, gain back 60lbs year later. go periods depression usually stop exercise become sedentary, times go hard, diet lose weight really easily. Lost mother last year gained weight. Feeling better I'm back exercise diet. One day may get steady weight, way long remember. I've always yoyo'ed weight one extreme other. think white house started realize one giving fuck said unless money helping cause. they're trying get reelected keep positions. Remember shit November hard go find information instead demanding someone hold hand lead like you’re child? 

The CDC website incredibly large. Trying distill correct information own, claim specific information website, rather pointless. supply choose comply hoax

Which hoax that? 200 countries reported deaths. 200 governments can't agree day is, let alone come hoax agree with. So, I'm afraid arguement without merit.

Now... relevant information, POST IT. Otherwise, stop trying pass false information truth. guy 49. using happened 49 year old justify saying younger generations? nobody actually bother check old dude was? better worse interstate travel guaranteed US constitution. 

I'm favor strong, coordinated responses virus US, I'm sure want fighting supreme court case order so. Honestly, ""them"". Sad say. wasn’t meaning argue but, India despite arable land, health care systems won’t able handle massive surges, I’ll impressed 

Comparing China’s 60k+ Billion USD worth India’s 13k+ bullion USD worth, health care system isn’t gonna cope well, either cases India gonna effected way worse China able control spread. (Yes realize it’s one fastest growing economies yet doesn’t change fact it’s still rich care 10s millions infections (how many ever hospitalized that... let play out)  They’re saying people’s decision “over quarantine” based nothing. figures stand stark contrast perceptions United States, recent survey found **Americans rate risk China U.S. largely equivalent.**

Can confirm. told couple American friends I'm planning trip east Asia later year, immediate responses 'it's dangerous go' - folks went Florida memorial's day weekend cheese 🧀 flat true guess bright side...sad face better moon face? think cause going gym regular mask (not N95) really going help.

Unless go really empty gym. Congress also doesnt want give money working people gonna get burned I’m willing pay long profits go folks worked hard invent it, research it, distribute think meant ""based nothing, people decided done quarantine"". many protested rioted ? talking point trying fob rise cases protests. moving, saying, intent create appearance rational governance. New Braunfels doesn’t get it. fact masks political thing seen thing “pussies” wear peak lizard brain.

Hopefully dumb ones removed gene pool innocent people die, course thats goes Supreme court ruled 5-4 churches this. agree 4. I'm religious person but, I'm always reminded poem ""First came"".

End day, main point can; mean should. Yeah even Chicago, Illinois, biggest city one states took lockdown seriously, pretty much nobody wearing masks outside anymore (except me) see exhumed JFK raise one benevolent AI mastermind Take breath read sentence again. He's saying people's decision done based nothing, quarantine. Cool blames youngins one like ""oh haha time open Texas back up, could go wrong?"" due awesome job states testing - VP quit assholes wear masks church

Mask wearing reduces likelihood spreading virus, eliminate it. got good point there.

We got multi purpose toilet lids. Can't follow whatever Taiwan, Korea, New Zealand T? something unique US work? Everyone wears mask &amp; keeps distance control far, right? He's saying ending quarantine based nothing, quarantine based nothing. Whenever people mention second wave don’t think understand it’s inevitable without vaccine you’re squashing curve, America. 
Edit: first wave naturally ends without new quarantine measures won’t second wave mean, reason try model paths hurricanes? color coding terrible. Trending 2% 148% red...

Hand sanitizer one barrier many matter it’s percentage effectiveness. barrier cuts *any* percentage cases makes impact. Quarantine barrier, hand washing/sanitation barrier, outside closed areas barrier, masks barrier. get idea.

Oh hand sanitizer makes masks effective. (You know everybody complaining using masks incorrectly that’s they’re super duper effective whatever)

I really nervous first protest two went saw mask rate 90% (really 95+ I’m conservative) lot less fears alleviated. case spreading going come protesters thrown paddy wagons, jails kettled small areas. 

The blame police. guy Governor President seem downplay really blame young people taking seriously. mean government generally taking major action prevent spread would individual assume should. (talking average people ""average"" intelligence people take educated subject) Texan here. I’ve seen tons people restaurants parks zero PPE last several weeks. may well spitting other’s mouths point. Hey now. Oregon too! That’s institutionalised way thinking. ... Beijing blows fuck Well technically yed that's genocide USA yet

The USA big place, plenty areas absolutely while.

NY seeing 1,000 deaths per day peak, yesterday? 46. front page news yet everyone media pointing small number outlier states seeing spikes. states take extra precautions, places seeing many new cases open. Actually thing Belgium mixing confirmed cases suspected cases, whereas european countries confirmed case count several studies statistics excess mortality 2020, published available providing rather clear view IMO I'm providing example 1% risk mortality. comparing 1% mortality civilian deaths explicable reason, since purpose comparison emphasize individual perception risk face similar odds. Yeah. It’s called chaos theory. models lack strong predictive power. They’re representation best assumptions. T-shirt. website added Arnold's exit meant political stance — simply concerned other's safety.

We need many people possible saying this. fucking political, public safety. Murdoch news orgs time.


Exactly this. more, less. full time propaganda outlets believed 40% people. bad situation. Love name. Yeah know someone medical professional VA. Leadership similar federal government (weak) go buy outdated policies procedures, frown upon scold anyone ""thinks outside box"" Hey like military!
They also tight PPE make staff reuse masks. 1st temp checks staff, anymore. facility NC GOP voters PA literal mouth breathing morons. Might well Alabama. people represent better. live North end NH. People stopped wearing masks distancing 4 weeks ago so, whenever restaurants we're allowed reopen outdoor dining. 

The reason slammed, need tourists actually re-introduce virus since mostly subsided. people NY expect us boom near future. I’ll give hint—they don’t need see it, *like* it. strongman hurting people don’t like, that’s matters them. Stay safe friend! isn't. dad 73 year looks lot like Arnold. got bodybuilding/weight lifting 1970's literally worked every single day since then, barring illness travel. he's aged longer lifts heavy focuses cardio more, possible keep muscle long work it. here’s problem, states different things reopen people begin traveling within US again. What’s stopping someone traveling states hard hit place somewhere got control? There’s restrictions travel, limitations states etc. 
For example dad works food industry facilities multiple states including hard hit ones (AZ SC). traveling states within past weeks/a month. said flight (to AZ) definitely empty either.

Imo US failed, unified national response administration basically telling states individually handle it. virus continues circulate country.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Florida reported another 2,610 cases COVID-19 Wednesday morning saw coronavirus death toll rise 3,000. numbers come one day state set record 2,783 new cases. 

173 less yesterday. See “open cuntry back” people don’t understand. Yes open, correctly. going enforce mask social distancing basic thing prevent spread 2783 two days ago 2610 yesterday. cases dropping! Florida great job /s Ah yes see facebook posts crying masks liberty definitely younger crowd. live Philly. I'm walking dogs hanging patio, park, I'm wearing mask. go building/store, wear mask. I've seen residents here. 52% positive rate. Jesus Christ. 

But hey, make masks mandatory, people could medical conditions like itchy nose cant scratch mask on, cant force vulnerable people put comfort risk wear mask hours. don’t know man, feel like would? It’s soaked w DNA. corona, mask also. doctor anything. feel like would limit effectiveness? statics coming Brazil mess... governor local municipalities pressuring doctors report fake covid19 cases... became political virus I’m surprised Arnold doesn’t gym inside one mansions. mistake. could swear Cuba factored education somewhere.

Anjali Ramkissonis former University Miami medical resident. January 2016, Anjali videotaped attacking Uber driver drunk. University taken pages mentioning Anjali's name since incident. Centre county. Significant drop mask use, especially students trickling in. Kids pull shirts barely front mouth get door laugh drop walk around store. (Retail employee). 
We line checkout store probably 8-10 people absolutely masks. corporate office let us enforce mask wearing (and verbatim) ""employees could shot spit asking customer wear mask leave store."" 
People begun harassing employees""Do wear mask?! going physically remove me?!""
I get paid nearly enough shit. ignorance mind boggling.
I feeling fall get nasty. -Michael Scott I’m denying that, I’m saying can’t conclude death numbers alone. you’ve seen simulations virus spread, you’ll see randomness plays massive role, going beyond first week cases.

Look Ontario vs Quebec (in Canada). Similar population density, similar culture, similar breakout cases start pandemic. Also critically, response provinces almost identical. 

Quebec almost 3 times many cases per person. 

I’m responding OP claiming directly conclude death totals Sweden’s response worse. was/is worse, thats huge part reason Sweden poorly right now. seems almost random, sick get. I'm fitness coach. tell people that's mostly head feel like that. takes order months dramatically lose strength often longer dramatically lose muscle unless serious calorie deficit. Like building foundation house, solid foundation lean muscle mass really makes big difference. GOP state feckless. either extremely religious nutcase neocons idea properly govern. weasel words?! honesty words... Would count natural artificial selection? think tourist going think twice traveling states rising uptick cases. Exactly! friends refuse wear one baffles me. family won’t go eat can’t trust health restaurant staff, mostly due people. thought nz citizens, living abroad. Can’t leave alone die out? Yes doubt 31 cases reality. probably multiply 10x even 100x. Still better numbers see USA. visited Allentown weekend. People businesses taking seriously, bit culture shock coming Williamsport. friend didn’t think advance every restaurant booked reservations. decided see could find place Bethlehem. don’t know, Allentown home lot POCs there’s lot poverty.

Bethlehem surreal, turned corner onto one Bethlehem’s main downtown streets sight absolutely absurd. Bougie white people crammed outdoor seating everywhere. Masks rare. saw couple blocks get intersection end street two cops horseback saunter intersection traffic stacked behind them. icing cake absurdity downtown Bethlehem. friend felt really uncomfortable decided return back place attempt go another restaurant Allentown. surreal see juxtaposition two adjacent communities. One wh ite priv ilege one without. many easily claim second wave.. first one never ended. Matthew 6: 5-8 Yes! great voyage pre-paid ticket for. 

I'm Buddhist death topic forefront meditation. meant morbid. Someone hear word death think morbid even think say anything it. 'If stop testing right now, we'd cases, any' like wearing masks, good Arnold, sincerely. work, assessed risk chose go elsewhere. Maybe lead gym change policy enforce mask wearing times, maybe won't. Either way fine outcome.

The issue gym's policies could clearly explained. fact piece shit isn’t already behind bars life blows mind. One coworkers daughter works nursing home. said cases kept increasing stopped allowing outside visitors, temperature checks implemented social distancing, etc. daughter even got Covid almost symptoms.

Basically health care workers asymptomatic, minor symptoms brought nursing homes early testing PPE. blame anyone, know enough enough testing 3 months ago. bet brush teeth either. suppose appropriate compare death toll war casualties, considering virus going start one. Thanks, haven’t taught link like that. Someday, yes stories scary af. answer is: depends. someone coronavirus walks packed gym AC blasting proceeds breath everyone absolutely safe. state low amount cases, gym reduced occupancy, sanitation/masks handled properly? risk minimal. Yep far 3 states... transmission possible difficult - would need big crowd people close together chanting singing yelling lot dangerous.

Like protests hours every day three weeks. going spread virus.

On hand, protests, people freaking briefly walked past someone, outdoors, wearing mask. widespread testing done employers? good news. Well wrong... mean especially compare China.  Thankgod right side history. idiots want kill themselves, that’s deal with. Could way isn’t going take random people them? Disney still okay open right?  69 year old aunt lost sense smell low fever week. coworkers 31 year old girlfriend put ventilator, strange virus cares waves, US facing tsunami.. tell someone state that’s crushed virus, people take seriously here. Sure businesses closed, people didn’t follow stay home order largely didn’t wear masks. yet, cases continued fall testing increased. Odds aren’t guarantees. sounds like got lucky roll dice — that’s wonderful. subreddit coronavirus news. news related coronavirus belongs here. content desire see, may suggest unsubscribing subreddit? every pathogen ever existed works world. countries approaching second. Murtica first! Texas: coming Florida. saw man kill three men pencil. Hmm.. must cold one Florida, since heat kills virus 🤔 /s Looks like wheels falling off. Thank you, today day 7 since test done, believe took 5 days get results back me?! far I've yet cough, fever, fatigue, shortness breath, classic covid symptoms. easy go life like nothing happening. 

I'm glad dad ok. prisoners Wait, thought due seasonal effects, moves across hemispheres cooler wetter months. Could also taken one look south east asia, pretty easy see common denominator was. actually Barron Trump Yea know, easier said done. pisses end. Exactly...we 75+ year olds front lines WWI Deaths lag time new cases. Check back 10 days. protester gets virus dies despite wearing masks social distancing need charge maskless cops around murder COPS spreading virus protesters. absolutely fucking shameful people still attacking protesters without one critical word monsters law enforcement. Exactly guess already ripped community early never got locked harder younger groups. Kinda sad, lot people poor fuck areas simply never financially recover need hospitalized. Years voting interests. guy said needed sacrifice people economy? another state official? Nba planning starting next season December. Welcome America telling people wear respirators? masks?

Because words suggest telling regular people wear respirators. 2 worried rioters burning stuff Gavin Newsom's mistake gave rural counties wanted end lockdown early.

Once part state re-opened, rest state became impatient started breaking lockdown.

Newsom seems like he's decided go instead fighting it, praying California's hype ER capacity medical staffing real. trying convince people longer problem. maybe we've built resistance due repeat sinus infections. steroids antinflamatories could also help. Can't second wave first never ended. Yep, is. proof Karen meme nothing misogyny ageism. Hi Chinese owned Reddit 👋🏻 man wish could. big name store would probably get fired. I’m allowed refuse service according management, tell policy must wear one. information getting CIDRAPs report researchers noted three pandemics since 1918 characterized initial wave cases spring, followed larger wave fall.  mind good reason, work home play videogames day happily enough reason point.  would today plan lock country 100% get virus, isn't. Even food, could packaging, people gotten sick virus clinging packages. got argument nurse (a fucking nurse) said face masks don’t work. also doesn’t vaccinate. fuck wrong people? feel that. stress making physically ill alternative? Acting like Trump pretending happening? Probably won’t help much. Look China. Everyone wears masks, Beijing still hit second wave really plausible many people would protesting masks basic safety measures... guess one metaphorical/ exaggerated movies like snow peircer I’d say protestors moderate blip aren’t already showcased here. protests got shut fairly quickly curfew place (which REALLY prohibited protesting). Also weren’t large would happen shorter amount time (too hot). 
This gonna coupled people that, time, huddled inside heat, either restaurants, bars, stores. inside anywhere refuge desert, that’s significant factor we’re seeing numbers. !RemindMe 1/1/2021 amount denial America shocking. months people saying, Americans 1 million cases, way China 80k. 

It goes way beyond ""China lying"". denial badly, well.

Going comments, Americans can't even accept New Zealand done well, allies. needs mutate Ebola-like symptoms.

People take respiratory diseases seriously, clam moment blood starts gushing every hole. Lol lost. Wrong sub bud. Possibly he’s giving mixed statements public President COVID. 1990's hondas run forever. Lawnmower engine metal box minimal electrical / control points. doesn’t cure anything, haven’t done it. tell sick bullshit proceed kick store? I'm sure majority would back. Rally goers parties bad they're willing put others risk they're selfish. protests important cause much bigger scale. mind asking state? peaked curiosity! yes western beautiful! I'd live that's long commute ha! work remotely, employer HQ'd California intentions returning office least September probably January.  Matlock Totally. data saw recently, worst quality masks prevent wearer virus 30% prevent wearer spreading virus others 90%. Better masks wearing masks correctly improve numbers seem prevalent America. I'm mad. I've pandemic TWICE, Korea, Texas. 

The difference responses populations night day. literally mocked older Texans wearing mask.

I say fuck em. They're putting life danger selfishness. Let em catch they'll singing different tune, still sing. 

Kill base he's gone next election cycle. one things piss off. hate hearing people say can't breathe them. last time heard patient dying surgical theater full doctors nurses passed breath?

They designed breathed through. purpose. That's China hu Jin tao era

.... Meh proper food handling cooking kill it. Oh wait get salmonella improper food handling. people would acknowledge there's still huge risk willing modify activities things would much manageable. There's lots churches done well masks distancing, outdoor services, etc. find new normal still provides us lots freedom. Trying make everything exactly like going downfall. *not* like was, still good. 700 Alabama likely lot considering they've reporting issues two major hospitals area. Texas hospitalizations increased 200 today - keep going up. problem - goal make sure get worse - neither state seems interested preventing. countries ""humans"" too, nearly ridiculous.

This brand ignorance seems uniquely American. far gun safety issue. one tell can't do, even kills others. Magic Gloves! favorite lazy people everywhere. 

My personal favorite magic gloves sanitize taking money handling food. one single fucking word law enforcement wearing masks social distancing. Absolutely fucking unbelievable.  Soon cases exceed 1 million Thursday, 1.5 million end month. Thanks United. Appreciate it. Something wicked way comes Absolutely. tend wonder connect primate tendency survival? Maybe simply illusion everything fine, fuel confidence catharsis? I've outbursts, threats violence. benefits liberal(ish) city suppose. small handful people leave informed mask required (we note door effect), people put one they're told asked.  people north/west wore masks.

But going downvoted reddit echo chamber fear cures stupidity? vaccine trial work worldwide hospitals. masks nature's way warning visually human-type danger present.

""Caution, potential hazard existence well-being.""

Treat accordingly avoiding gently shooing away forced engage expect poisoned/stung/shot/infected things go bad.  I'll stop argument. Looks like neither us gain anything this. think agree fact hope pandemic ends soon many casualties occur. hope stay safe well! even read comment get mad called everyday people wearing masks? Lmfao. whole point I’m telling people wear masks... lmao better hope don’t see me. means you’re hospital, that’s spend time. U.S. State Trends

Yes, decline US states, Michigan, say, epidemic New York.

But fact due different policies various states United States, lead serious inconsistencies difficult get information perspective.

I'll give example, people coming China foreign countries (including Chinese citizens) uniformly tested concentrated quarantine sites Quarantine 14 days, followed home quarantine 7 days. policy clear implemented provinces China. Policies initially different province (e.g., current policy Beijing) unified later central government.

And message United States sends feds basically care, individual states govern themselves, individual states make policies differently

The message receive several states U.S. declined, time, several states reached new highs new cases, looks like rock plunged calm lake, creating diffuse ripples highs lows still spreading

I know understand analogy.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate willingness talk me. Also real Texans wear masks. already made point. trying win pissing contest see whose point relevant? understand sued. get different religious solution sold. mom giving away social security check able afford care perfectly fine. Suspect we'll come realize trying crush virus inter-connected world folly, efforts directed towards protecting vulnerable letting rest us move lives. agree. should’ve mentioned NYC 1st comment point we’re still declining even # protesters out. think biggest factor attitude. NYC hit hardest, know seen effects virus take guidelines seriously. Also, we’re densely populated one hotspot send us back started. We’re given daily briefings facts/data everyday, us want test get test free. Especially protesters urged test isolate. Even Staten Island predominately red, know get tested, masks take distancing seriously.

To many outside NYC, it’s like distant event; don’t think Covid affect them.... does. news yesterday, girl FL thought Covid over, went bar friends 15 caught virus. need start showing graphs country leave NYC show increasing cases hospitalizations. they’re saying test less dumb. even thought check post history right, stopped posting month ago. claimed COVID19 recovered already people relapsing. knows!

I hope he's okay... I'm willing give 5% virus, even guy. Maybe he's abandoned account pretty bad denial staunch it. I’d love better it’s yet many people Texas need reality check. coworker yesterday (who never wears mask) taking never hear Italy New York anymore Covid really bad media drama? Well, live Texas it’s getting worse precautions. 

I don’t want people panic would nice least believed virus real liberal hoax. mask reduce spread airborne virus mouth nose. breathe goes mask. meant filter. slow spread breath reach every single person come near.

Having web piece fabric going similarly effective dry piece fabric, it'll uncomfortable face. state’s 1,600 available ICU beds, Tuesday morning, 268 available, lowest since COVID-19 crisis began.*

This sounds good, realize counties literally jam packed simply can't accept patients.

Keep mind ICU Beds available Covid-19 patients - people without Covid also need ICU treatment already there. 

You want pick choose whose life important, reaching point here. Anybody total tests % positive yesterday? rate, 2021 going repeat 2020. Introverts must thriving! trying help people get death threats would say fuck too. Let ungrateful fucks die ventilator. thinks masks make us look weak. never going go it

Because China wearing masks pollution corona even thing. China it, trumps sheer spite. Can't seen anything first. saw last night governor request rally go forward, mostly huge number people expected travel parts unknown, expense cleaning facility he's gone (we know campaign shell that.) amount people going bars restaurants fun

You look that. look elected Trump. dinner last night overheard gentleman, assumed lawyer, tell table he’s currently making mint writing five-day notices. July 1 eviction moratorium ending he’s post dating second. 

I imagine lot people going moving next two weeks. Except people higher risk single resident crisis. Major universities people attending state though. Unless you’re proposing complete testing seclusion students moving campus housing attending classes, would support. original comment literally said ""People dont seem understand reason things opening back economy doesnt completely crash, people actually think things opening ""safe"".

How clear? Yes, think bad idea reopen areas case numbers low enough support reopening. never said alluded COVID-19 needs eradicated leave homes. That's great point well something i'd considered right let's honest issue last quite long companies trying reduce pay emmployees sacrificed risked lives profits deserve .

However unfortunately right aspects workforce could replaced eventually even  protest demand higher wages .

I thin key collective working together though.

Replacing 5 6 employees challenge, replacing training entire new store staff would nightmare executives. 

I'd imagine they'd begrudgingly raised salries replace staff know ? Really? 2000 positive single day number tests last month Man empathise. sniff health insurance here, £28 month add wife's free work insurance, want pay NHS worked within find fantastic. went documents I, someone working healthcare, found complicate hell. showed wife health insurance worth us took good half hour poring documents find caps, deductibles, fine print stipulations.

I can't imagine that. guys choice matter. God damn. two things news right now. way article get page clicks both! could somehow work China/India conflict, would help article even more! Agreed, also disagree it’s regional based

I live ontario, Kitchener waterloo seems ratio 2/3-10 wearing masks, tell people dont really care masks

On hand 15 mins away Guelph Ontario, everyone wears masks already ruled businesses must make customers wear masks... literally 15
Mins away demograph completely different. 

Guelph proactive hipster ish. 

Kw mostly older people students Unless balling, good luck bench weights. exactly right. Bad readership, -- I'm going get downvoted -- adequate leadership. Telling everyone wear masks enough health care workers would set panic. government lie us sometimes. take they're still refusing lock despite strategy working? Yeah gotta rot pile first. Nice. Anytime go store overrun maskless white boomer dads humpty dumptying around mouths hanging open sure lets blame kids. there's specific gene that's switched switched directly controls sick get specific virus. know yet. still speculation. travel NZ, spend two weeks indoors pretty much like would home hard-hit area, spend two three weeks visiting country knowledge whatever want, literally zero cases. company policy anyone traveling different county state self-quarantine home 2 weeks. one that. people going vacation coming back bragging vacation normal one wearing masks. Great. Sorry, non-residents. really change point people upset about.

Those people higher risk positive resident crisis, let testing compassion? Hey, judge book license plate. I'd much rather share space someone upstate NY area we've 139 cases total, someone Philly. Lol OK, fine -- long exceed capacity ambulances take pedestrians getting run over. rather remarkable. 

NYC went intense lockdown minute started, 21% antibodies 3 weeks pandemic 

Stockholm 14% 3 months pandemic despite much less aggressive lockdown   Mask wearing policy best option actually. proven heavily dampens infection rate. Like HK asian countries mask-wearing normal virus. even need lockdown mask wearing policy indoors even better everywhere. China's version control lying numbers theory nonsense, IMO.

You consider contacts locals tourists undirected graph, whenever local X contact tourist Y, tourist contact local X. coronavirus care direction transmit, tourist local, whether tourists whether none is.

The difference type vacation. go Sweden, probably going crammed places. probably visiting secluded vacation home, going supermarket twice, otherwise low number local contacts. Swedes come London, visit London Bridge, Piccadilly Circus etc. etc., high number contacts.

More real-world examples theory:

I'm certain people living Ischgl (Austria) time become infected elsewhere January fell ill spread February, live short winter season suspect take vacation days summertime. Instead, served tourists crammed ski huts, infected tourists, infected tourists.

Similar cruise ships, count destination, consider sailors ""locals"" passengers tourists.

Wherever many tourists crammed small spaces, infection risk high. tourists spread out, risk lower. watching yesterday (resident Florida) went different “hot spots” high positivity rates. mentioned central Florida airport, didn’t say one. [It can, often is, reported know 30 year olds moving back parents. 

This normal. wild feeling see childhood hero's turn senior citizens. life trip. Oregon sub praising kind behavior? Oregon redditors love nothing shit churches covid deniers. Ah, grocery store processed foods last long enough. *special* preserved goods take mid-trib is, scientifically, True Believers get raptured.

I wish joking brother law fallen several expensive processed food thingies. keeps telling us frozen food lasts month canned goods year. wondering hell full grown adult life experience know bull, lives fast food, can't cook save life, generally naive incapable. Becouse others faster making masks, they(Trump &amp; freinds) go route. Namely ceasing(robbing) masks reselling huge markup forcing states bid masks. 
Since worked them, vary much interested prolonging moneymaking scheme long posible. Eg. longer pandemic runs money make. second thought sarcastic... figured meant people yelling faces/ears therefore spreading droplets. Ugh.

Not enough people grew watching Seaseme Street guess. lot people vote all. elected stupid much people voted Trump. Looking way, huge amount people either wanted Trump president, care would President. housing market could drop next, that'd great... Gov. Ron DeSantis said 260 workers Orlando International Airport tested positive coronavirus nearly 500 employees tested.

More 50% positivity rate. great. Sweet! justifies death penalty books. man vile sick creature gets. One thing live state pnw different counties different phases reopening say youre phase 2 cant yet eat sit restaurants shopping malls still closed still restrictions. next county phase 3 things people flock next counties makes sense opening county different phase helpful. near control virus, cases rising people living isnt real. masks, social distancing.. Public transport back normal week ago entered back doors 3 people max bus. cant tell american thats stepping rights well right keep virus going pride stupidity. lie got healthcare workers infected. Many hospitals cited CDC policy refused provide PPE. Wow!

Welcome Disney World (COUGH) SEPA people generally pretty good still, slowly getting lax. feel bad saying this, looking surging southern states gives little hope PA. states behaved terribly many weeks reach point now, things going keep getting worse reaches crisis levels, even eventually realize mistake take corrective measures, it'll take work. Obviously tragic situation, someone relatives SC, I'm afraid well-being.

But things get really bad south next weeks, COVID return news cycle people hopefully pay attention again. Pennsylvanians see people suffering dying Arizona, Texas, South Carolina, I'm hoping they'll start taking situation seriously things reach crisis level here. still chance learn mistakes. Really? happen? thought everyone forgotten Tony tiger. Remember commercials actually catchy jingles totally unfunny unmemorable gap times shows? There's use logic here. majority people sub want stay lockdown forever. absolutely correct - long continue masks/distancing reason start opening. People hoarded supplies supplies back stock everywhere. Hospital capacity fine. time. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* It’s personality. went cousins birthday cousin/her husband there. see like year excited catch up... nope, spent whole time outside smoking/shooting shit strangers. It’s like people want go bar bullshit people. Well, let's see. Graduated High School 69, college 69 71, business administration computer programing. Paid working full time going school full time.

Got married 71 went work paper mill. Military 73 79 high voltage electrician. Back mill 79 86. 

In late 80's, started whole sale business consigned novelty goods 200 convenient stores morphed auction house. 86 89, earned around 100k per year. 

I sold 89 friend created new tool die manufacturing business. sold share 91 went S. Dakota work high steel. earned around 90k per year. 

Came back Michigan 96 worked heavy construction, around 60k per year. 99, started repairing forging stamping presses traveling anywhere Northern Canada South America. earned around 120k per year. company went 03 created pilot car business guiding oversize loads around US, Canada, Mexico. 

I sold business 4 pilot cars drivers 09 175k came back home base Michigan. 

Our parents passed 2012 bought sisters share 60 acre farm 2 houses 2 large commercial buildings paid 6 years growing medical marijuana. Starting 2010, also began building commercial grows clients still build today. I've built financed 17 builds thus far. Today earn around 200k per year. 

As proof, every state reopened early major spikes Covid. According you, probably coincidence. Got it. 

Last year, remodeled one commercial buildings farm become light manufacturing facility. decided want manufacture yet. 

Starting last year, also planted farm wild flowers bees started tree planting project within 10 years, farm entirely trees flowers.

By way, life experiences think went missed on? think people pay 90k 100k looks?

I owe money anyone, work hours, roughly 6 12 per day, employ 20 people, helped 7 employees buy homes. next three employees slated buy homes paid within 7 years.

I fail see words value use me, way. continued going hard cardio / HIIT since pandemic started wearing mask whole time. first couple weeks difficult take easier normally do. that, feels normal able work hard. 

This purely anecdotal, take grain salt, think cardio endurance best ever been. think mask something it. follow user? people visiting dying parent, going holiday.  point relevant here? mean, it’s clearly obvious anyone ask question, like author particular article.

And it’s confirmed publicly, fits definition conspiracy hypothesis. actually misread agree you, sorry that!! Sauce? Yeah, downfall northeast think. Leave us get cocky ruin great progress we’ve made far. 

Or I’m wrong whole thing over. Source false positives? It’s supposed extremely rare PCR test (the one looks current infection). ambiguity arises *what* leaving. Leaving house office physical space particular point time (so may easily return). also ""leave"" abstract entities, like organizations (e.g. ""so-and-so left Republican party""), tends bigger deal: might return, generally going simple walking door.

The interesting thing case gym *both* physical location *and* organization - ""leaving gym"" could either refer walking front door go rest day (e.g. ""I'm leaving gym home time dinner"") cancelling membership (e.g. ""I'm leaving gym can't afford fees anymore).

I say headline *definitely* means stopped member gym, definitely ambiguous side. exciting!/s Exactly - end game? virus part human condition permanently. going try exist bubble forever? Florida plates welcome fool thinks countries backlog. do, ignore it. Lol plenty nyc protests you’re full shit. think maybe they’re jumping ahead here...[companies forcing employees sign event get COVID-19 believe trying pass legislation protect corporations well. 4. cough, can't exactly cover mouth lifting weights hands. saw article twitter yesterday. I’ll try find now. one advanced countries world, it’s embarrassing stupid citizens be. Doucey. It’s 3 way race right Workers close together. spaced apart line slowed down. I’ve inhaled corticosteroids since 1997. I’ve lucky enough good insurance, manufacturers coupons offset (the Symbicort free coupon, would’ve $50 insurance), yeah. sucks. looking Craigslist, Bay Area studios going $2100/mo couple hundred dollars already. think lot tech companies working home though. people know companies return office January all. horrible summary data. Mask wearing useful combined social distancing. Masks alone aren’t key ridiculous 5 different families know vacationing AZ plan month. seems like everyone headed AZ “escape”. would easy track anyone tried - know exactly flight. Rachel Maddow following weeks....no surprise here.... Greg Abbott go prison coronavirus deaths Texas. damn shame! Probably well US took 3 years decide join war then. way reach 2 million .6% IFR. number people recover (produce antibodies) increases, less number people virus would able infect, reduces infection rate. 2 million deaths reached t.6% rate, everyone would infected time. obviously happened would increase IFR recommendations 

Hmm... Unfortunately nothing 100% protective masks help wearer some, n95 highest level, filtering 95% particles. yeah, maybe kind quarantine/restriction would impossible, think would helped ban travel states March/early April. but, like say, probably would led terrible legal wrangling. Japan, people voluntarily travel outside prefectures...if New Yorkers could shown responsibility. steroid shrinks balls breast.

dont it. Pretty embarrassing post. hard anyone accept good news? Yes, situation awful things getting *better* it’s ok admit that. confirm. Canadian living 5 min border crossing. Happy see stay closed! usa host tv show? Humans general seem huge capacity things like denial. 

I amazed early March HR laughed asking policy virus spreads lot, week later mailing laptop apartment could work home.  seems happening again, right now. way early. even vaccine deployed beginning October, inoculating 8 billion people take longer 7 months. Imagine testing 8 billion people, nowhere near capacity, vaccine distribution different? 

I know joking though :) figured i'd put concepts afraid of. virus sucks wish never happened :( Policy law different. may fired job arrested. I’ll never understand people like you... course there’s risk everything world. even said it’s risk versus reward. Drive ice cream minuscule risk doesn’t even really count. one person covid could possibly infect 100’s hundreds could possible thousands. 

“Worldwide deaths motor vehicle accidents still leading deaths auto accidents”.... well shit He's focused law enforcement getting neutered military questioning ""leadership"". want know 140,000 Americans died propaganda inaction. Hey, good looks. Thanks :) There's always people discipline hold out, happen scale uniquely American trait. Australia lot people that's daily local transmitions counted fingers we're going phased re-opening. like parallel universe, went 21st century middle ages 6 months. Next burning ""witches"" accused spreading Rona. So? China order factories stay open. US government did. Masks magically eradicate spread places people wear masks - like home. They're also 100% effective.

So getting rid last bits virus hard. look countries like South Korea who've 30 cases/day months now. border Austin Pville/RR/Cedar Park, masks definitely fading away circumstances. Every time went HEB past weeks like clockwork like 5-10% less people wearing masks. I’ve ended saying fuck curbside only. disagree. I've terrible experiences absolutely fire One wonders many families held close detentions got infected him. Ohhh haha read wrong! Yikes! lady come w/o mask asked one put on. response? “God no. haven’t worn one weeks job I’m nurse.” .... Hope best, plan worst. **SARS**-CoV-2 violate fuck lungs too, even kill you.

We'd fucked 18.8k places like NYC, won't. lot buildings owned hedge funds care rent spaces. walk avenue NYC see many storefronts rent signs (sometimes) years hedge funds take tax writeoff lost rent. want charge astronomical rent get it, leave aren’t. haven’t seen single person wearing mask public.
We aren’t that.

Sincerely, dissappointed Swede. going cut pay. work Las Vegas strip. let property work know concerns. included sources news articles government recommendations back feelings. Never got response back. 

The casinos run executives. executives motivated quarterly bonuses. means Vegas terribly short-sighted decisions. 

It's normally comical, right now. Ignite ... freedom? earth would think that? hitting three weeks since surge, people dying pre-surge patients. interest rates 6% again, people would likely paying exact amount per month they're paying today, banks would get money. People tend buy limit afford demand adjusts accordingly.

The bigger problem building fast enough since last recession hit. Look housing starts pre post bubble worst harass evict you. Goddamn happened day Costco. shouting teenager (in mask) end aisle. Right past me, like seven foot distance. forget covid-19 spread course three months numbers list spread entire lifetime  everyone caught virus 

GOD subreddit insufferable  sentence, ""you"" mean whichever audience wants mean. mean, U.S. mean alleged countries. both. deliberately vague, accurate reading part anyone's really.

I think context surrounding makes pretty clear, wrong people chose fits existing he's bragging testing administration neglected deferred states. words, Trump administration's actions undermine words.

Again, said many times, guy dumb dumb saying dumb stuff. bragging something help with, mean isn't' bragging it, saw total numbers, US 26 Million, next largest single country testing amount 15 million, 3rd place 7 million. Germany less 5 million... lots testing, bad trump meaningful ways looking testing absolute number. Trying really hard break nose? guys failed us. becomes norm save $60k income taxes marginal cost $4000/month housing cost increases. Basically wash also worth it. fucking shit-show been. New Zealander, I'm extremely disappointed border control. Whether called herd immunity controlled spread, whether considered herd immunity possible side effect stratgey whether drove strategy, largely irrelevant.

You consider Sweden's approach out-and-out disaster consider qualified success, depending point view. Either viewpoint opinion, either neither viewpoints largely relevant either. 

The fact virus spread expotentially Sweden, health care systems collapse vast majority people unnafected it. 

Their major fuck dealing properly nursing homes, 60% deaths occurred. guilty - UK, Italy Ireland. 

While mortality rate higher neighbours, lower countries imposed strictest lockdowns look mortality rates since February, pattern across Europe - peaking April decling steadily since then. 

Would stricter lockdown measures prevented deaths Sweden? Possibly. hard determine actually case not. far many variables. 

Their strategy perfect, again, could said countries. mortality rates tell one side story many negative repercussions hit across board due dranconian steps taken. Great news! really. time record testing.. lower positive percentages... going good, QUIT GOING FUCKING CHURCH!!! JESUS WOULD ACCUSE SELFISH TWAT Companies shut time night. I’ve two Microsoft events Hollywood Studios. Yeah, exactly apartments going 60% used to? listings look basically me. Studios live listed 3-4k still. Portugal around number Oh, it’s almost always used incorrectly. 

It sort redundant guess. *Told* imply *literally*, that’s true. Virus basically natural disaster, almost definition threat. virus stops threat completely eradicated. 

With natural disasters, goal stop threat, reduce damage cause. go mentality ""We win"" pretty much guaranteed lose. Yeah landlord charges mortgage cost pretty much getting free $400k+ end assumed 30 yrs. Pretty common story Colorado hear people work make 2 grand profit month renting house mortgage hasnt changed 2005 rent area tripled. ya know house sell that. Definitely story everywhere damn pretty much taking money hand fist people. Ah makes sense now, thanks! Yep! Exactly. tegnell said pretty clear.

It's weird deny even though they've admitted past (the link bunch sources gave also contains video Giesecke outright saying well: ). many also deny strategy. really like gaslighitng tbh. 

Well, guess weird *authorities* deny Tegnell said like using gives wrong impression. weird many population still deny despite evidence what's going on. tool There's whole different world Wuhan style lockdown basic social distancing instead cramming one picnic table spread little bit barbecue rent went up.... Charleston wants know Charlotte cheapening Market Jesus Christ.....I pay $750 2400sqft house......and that's 10 year note agree, totally deserves it. still better ways get back throwing stuff. remember say goodbye loved ones drop ER.  Second wave going flush ton people holding onto AirBnBs hopes quick recovery. Like made bed lay Testing compulsory.

They travelled 9+ hours. Obviously stopping along way gas, food toilet stops. Also stopping friends house got lost. friend hugged kissed them, attending gym class.

If reading concern given exponential growth starts, I'm sure will. wouldn’t want generalize fans contrarians see coming  worry... Darwin soon prove right Wish move last week.

That said, moved much central cool part town exact rent. Smaller space would easily expected extra $500 month here. huge mess. reporting numbers twice day, morning late afternoon, changed reporting 10am. Yesterday incomplete data come til much later day. several days late noisy data. much difficult follow. guy near Huntsville tracker lot folks follow. months ago, Yang probably 20 years early policies really take US. Now, I'd say 4-8 years early. inadvertently misleading. may may become aerosol definitely get around air normal breathing/talking, coughs, exertion sneezes. think 6-8 feet right money airplanes. say 3 rows ahead behind you.

CDC currently saying one three symptoms all, what's gradient mild symptoms pretty wide anything losing sense taste smell barely avoiding hospital stay would still considered mild I'm also excited see decline sexual harassment everyone working home. There's lot negative behaviors eliminated night. I’m sure I’m downvoted, previous commenter tried imply small percentage wearing mask wouldn’t catch coronavirus. understand completely masks help stop spread, agree places like malls, stores, etc. enforce mask policies. suggest wearing mask problems blatant lie. Someone forgot tell landlord.. I'm Texas pay 1500 shitty 2 bedroom 750 sqft updated since built 70s, except got rid avocado green appliances replaced cheapest appliances avaiable decade ago.

It's cheapest apartment around started renting around $1300. pay almost $2200 8 years. Well, yes, takes time die. Today's new cases dying another threee weeks, today's death rate associated cases 3+ weeks ago.

I started pandemic concern them, I'm legitimately waiting die off. country better without toxic influence. Official number Texas Department Health Human Services 4,098 (!)**.** almost 1,600 previous highest daily new case count.

 Coronavirus wants this... big dexamethasone exist, generic decades tested positive today. Felt bit shitty last week days, feel fine now. Based people study things, genetic markers point natural virus. can't argue conspiracy theorists everything evidence conspiracy. ""A 40-year-old health care worker 10 friends tested positive COVID-19 one thing common spent evening Jacksonville Beach bar, several bar staffers also tested positive, according media reports her Facebook posts""

Well, expecting 40 year old healthcare worker.

Sorry? friends loved ones Mexico. I've lived Mexico favorite country planet. said, Mexico done little testing relied mathematical models estimate coronavirus spread.

More recent studies peer reviewed journals starting come droplets touching surfaces primary source infection. plainly obvious look contact traced study outbreaks MUST airborne transmission spending lot time enclosed space infected individual causes outbreaks. show graph shows cases trending down.

instead giving diatribe opinion, prove jackass. current rules applied land border. Canadians still fly USA visit anytime reason, quaratine 14 days returning Canada. 

I shocked learn too, US border confirmed 

I long term partner lives Texas seen since Feb. sure back yet. Better safe side. fact never occurs people billions pay taxes every year could used address issues shows bad really is.  People lost sight fact government works us serves us way around. money. right it. Pretty much. Yup.  Lol sure is..your type saying ""shits fucked"" months now. Yet declining everywhere hospitals overrun etc.

""Experts"" like others overhyped problem promote mask usage. always choice closing completely open full stop. open masks contact tracing? Seems like good compromise me. Pretty good, Netflix tho it’s TNT many things brand new infectious disease? Nationally down. metrics nationally. matter opinion. Coronavirus nodding approval... mean makes perfect sense cost-benefit perspective. 


What consequences pessimistic virus?? joined sub late january, mid February pulled everything market sold 2nd car, cut spending bare bones cancelled/sold event tickets including Coachella tickets Hawaii May. end February stocked months food, medicine, masks, gloves even oxygen tanks got filled Mexico (turns buy tanks US need prescription fill them). March telling everyone job save much $ possible ready shutdown, laughed... two weeks later everyone laid off. told everyone knew hospitality/restaurant industry find new jobs ASAP 


Everything made next months much easier, maybe wasted $ oxygen extra meds I'll probably never use, keeping case 2nd wave disaster. furloughed job month honestly great time, bunch working reading running around last minute waiting 1hr lines costco already EVERYTHING needed home. Quarantine honestly pretty relaxing me.  


I prepared worst one people know surprised shut markets tanked. I'm telling people dead cat bounce markets tank again, we'll either enter 2nd shut hundreds thousands Americans die we'll effectively shut voluntarily anyways. I'm wrong?? consequences?? 3x savings I'm used to? needlessly spent hundred $ medical supplies use?? Thats it... 


Now consequences optimist getting blindsided like almost everyone know was?? best, poor planning even financially fucked would've been... worst, literally fucking dead.  


So yeah think I'll stick pessimism working pretty well far :) LOL. Shades gray? practically preaching we're edge apocalypse.

I'm saying everything's gonna turn roses gotta bring notch health dude. Finally good news. think change Linda Dianne. needed wear mask prevent spread.

just saying. Nobody cares think. people weaker immune systems, also experienced immune systems variety disease, may mean bodies “recognizing” threats acting (shooting shadows), whereas younger people haven’t encountered many diseases don’t respond much. Maybe. hypothesis. 

Is hypothesis backed medical literature? attacking you, medical student curious concept. Best wishes That's Argentina's total cases (32,785) I've never heard CNBG could least checked see ""owned source"".

CNBG's parent company Sinopharm, creator ""vaccine"". 

Science press releases really science works. Gonna chaos Jade Helm training. Libertarianism work, New Zealand. unless already Elysium built. antibody tests positive tests? can't find they're calculating them. People die time due various diseases..doesn't mean shut world hotspots need sort lockdown, way around it. places country need be. lockdowns dont last long people obey them. lockdown eased, people still need wear masks social distance much possible. many states rising cases done this. many citizens sacrifice money considered traitor? would fail paper ever used article research poorly conducted.... end world? No. bad? Yes. try keep people getting infected know actually does? Yeah sounds like good idea. yeah people want blame protesters fact timing cases coincides memorial day weekend parties/re-openings. Personally think *fear* leading resistance and/or ignorance. Yep, huge retiree population here... Why? people realizing overhyped used politics.

Its even obvious since protests * Jan 23, China locked Wuhan Hubei regionally.

* Jan 25, China locked entire country.

Obviously, China trying avoid another large outbreak. Hopefully, current measures sufficient. ssshhhhhhhh. Let keep 😉  disinfectant thing job. hoping help keep pathogens bay. Can't get person though. yet life doesn’t change many ways. Didn’t already end two months ago? isn’t me. UN CNN reported People fucking full shit full panic. 

Have seen bullshit propaganda /r/covid19positive everyone hypochondriac friends post brain damage, heart failure, neck cramps, hair loss, hearing issues, finger nail biting habbit. real posts last week dozens hundreds votes, like IDK TESTED NEGATIVE TWICE NEGATIVE ANTIBODIES SWEAR GOD GUYS going get WHOLE lot worse 2 week lag time infections.  surprised see 4-5,000 counts day couple weeks.  last weeks state opened, people complete idiots.  see posts FB friends hitting crowded bars Scottsdale couple times weekend. *The ‘rona...uh...finds way* videos first ones watched. pleasantly surprised everything done. walkways super open, people mostly wearing mask, super aggressive sanitizing, one mentioned trains weren’t allowed leave station everyone put masks. Yeah people crucify put edit disclaimer lol. nearly 6 months point think time retire talking point valid since many months ago.  People wearing masks simply flat fucking care need held accountable it. Cowards want look tough front stupid followers. real Trump cowered eagle, whines like diva twitter. room level nuance 2020, either believe corona kill every person earth don’t believe exists. Look bright side: Spanish influenza killed people WW1, Stalin famine, riots, WW2 combined. [click specular roast, like ""why idiot"" response suppose consider UN CNN credible US-centric site county long know existed, long china ignored silenced whistleblowers, well based cremation data basic math, way hell whopping 80k cases.

Do doubt done since January, no, used totalitarian lockdown numbers since certainly reasonable given measures took.

But 80k total, no, that's literally mathematically impossible data Wuhan bullshit really seen anyone outside working CCP claim anything fact

EDIT: Ah 7:46 Bejing, good morning members CCP joining threads Covid: “I can’t wait...” Kroger shit company. worked 6 years. hope comment upvoted top. Psychosis? exactly? certain President would better polls true. don’t understand skepticism. I’m mistaken claim drug could potentially save 1 person dying 25.

Oh feel bad her. want get many epidural steroid injections degenerative disc disease... makes bones brittle Federal government tried delay change methodologies, media using numbers state report too, putting together hides protests bunker Yeah it’s everywhere lol. comment didn’t age well 6 yr old understands need mask, complain wearing cute one, adults STILL throw fit it. 

My 6 yr old knows better adults. 🙄 didn’t hear name yet lasted like two days courts ruled illegal decision  majority National media located Northeast virus essentially dead. really baffling don't. dumped many trillions programs handle lockdown. Mass vaccines permanently end lockdowns nonsense. give someone reason second guess getting vaccine? asked would issue statwide mask order deflected question saying reason put law required people wear masks beaches evidence transmitted outside. 

The reporter asking wearing masks beaches. completely ignored people going inside businesses wearing there. Thanks. Maybe Trump demonstrate proper use ventilator.

It’s plague, partly difficult control. viruses kill people ones sort Goldilocks fatality rate. SarsCov2 Goldilocks virus. spreads really easily, especially indoors. 

Here’s main problem position. people like dismiss virus, likely stick around. 

The virus wants say it’s big deal. wants complacent. keeping alive. Please keep us out, don’t want shit show leaders shutting country teach people it’s serious, doesn’t make sense leaders choosing open back indicates it’s longer serious?

Leaders sending wrong message now. ...why

Are thinking people going back vaccines? Shrewd one last adjectives would use describe Trump. wasn’t born obscene wealth, probably would flunked high school spent rest life working drive through. think fairer comparison would use life expectancy drop measure many years (months?) life humans average lose due calamities. WWI Spanish flu followed would clear winners. Stupidity. elected stupid. get live die stupid get severely bad mood swings/mania I'm already depression meds anxiety meds I'm always afraid I'm going something crazy. feel like incredible hulk open 3 months ago. made sense all. involves Charlize Theron starters. Oh passed? Nevermind, everything fine, business usual. Jesus Christ. That's baffles me, GOP crying fake outrage, downplaying entire situation, wants use position blame young people, get fucked dude. Orgies limited 10 fewer people! 

But Georgia, ***fifty*** person orgies! yet see actual epidemiologist lockdown. Maybe disciplines motivated personal politics finances. people devoted lives studying handling far tell opening up. Rich asking question. Menwhile youre perfectly fine sacrificing 115k Americans *already* died three months, save unspecified amounts ""lockdown deaths"" abroad? fuck off. confirm. idea border opening virus denying loonies come play tourist mid pandemic terrifying.

This belongs r/iamatotalpieceofshit places outside America proper lids public toilets yes, America thing. Aaaand afford it, it’s $299. south needs get crud together. I’m glad I’m Northeast seeing great decreases mask compliance. references bottom numbers gets, using calculate excess categories. 

I agree rest saying. People Canada happy hear think bill says opening business lawfully considered reasonable negligence can’t found “solely basis” reopening.

Considering written proof evidence worker pushing ""reasonable"" covid protections, denied, individual died, family would likely case legal recourse even GOP bill. isn’t going baseball anyway. “Christmas busy time us, Mr. Cratchit.

Fauci continued say wanted give many masks possible front line workers emergency wanted make sure people, namely health care workers, brave enough put harm way, take care people know infected coronavirus danger getting infected,” Fauci concluded. Seems like Americans put freedom want benefit society. token, people don’t want exposed virus return normal life, means economy never get back vaccine. So, unfortunately situation, individual freedom result prolonged epidemic America, detriment society whole. Uh oh! said word police! Downvote! Fucking reddit morons. Go fuck CA course...

That's solution, that's cruel unusual. listening podcast mentioned thing. noted past companies adjusted salaries moved different areas country already working home. keep everyone separated never anything bad! good.... anything matter. Agree- I’m uptown (moved 5 months ago) monitoring prices since then. far haven’t seen drop equivalent unit style dollar price.

But guess question becomes people stay area/similar knowing could maybe move cheaper farther part DFW WFH. leases end presumably lower prices knows

I know say speaking convenience everything downtown nice. knew I’d working home foreseeable future? Might taken opportunity cheaper rent elsewhere trying get enough negative tests dilute increasing number positive tests, keep positivity percent rising.  lost cause, course. actual new infections rising exponential rate. cannot increase testing faster rate, virus win race. stupid strategy european countries following.

edit: LA though. $70K per household means maybe little savings, live slightly better neighborhood etc. etc. doesn’t free bills, mortgages, child expenses, car payments etc. impact long term recession medical bills major health crisis.

As young professionals children, household income frankly quite lot still don’t feel “obligated” spend part moral duty keep economy going. economy ups downs, convinced devastating second wave, it’s true personal finance goals save usual, pay mortgage much possible, front load retirement contributions 2020, bulk emergency fund case job loss.

I understand many people things. absolutely refuse guilted economic scale prioritizing personal finance instead obligation “rich” person go charging buy new boat new car fancy clothes whatever time uncertainty. Maybe indirectly causes economic outcome worse, there’s much I’m willing spend reason alone. Sure I’ve ordering takeout buying gift cards etc. support local businesses, never ever match come close pre-COVID-19 spending reality changed. spend things truly enjoy - like travel, long dining/drinking evenings out, etc. future outlook different too.

I could well lose job. husband could lose his. could lose jobs lose health coverage go marketplace COBRA get sick COVID-19 big hospital bill get long term illness unable return work etc. etc. realize that’s facing everyone else well *very very* rich immune things turning one’s life upside down. I’m scared anyone else fortunate position plan much possible exactly do. honestly possibly simply anomaly, woman happened get infected twice, haven’t seen widespread therefore it’s probably exception. stay safe. opening Texas utter shit show. Mask usage virtually non existent. Restaurants bars packed. 

At worst protests going accelerate already doomed fail.  hope so. would rather move elsewhere threatens worldview. psychological principle getting angry someone vegan. People acting believe right make uncomfortable. believe Texas Florida competing become new NY. We'll see evolves. $3800 1100 hate paying attention stuff. frustrates me. I'm hoping somebody following answer question.

How Wisconsin since dropping restrictions? Basically I'm expecting Wisconsin explode virus I'm wondering we're starting see happen yet not. worse. what's going all. basing assessment NZ lockdown protocol. Alert level 4. advocate US kept measures similar level 2 3 community transmission control. think New York ever something strict Level 3 harder tell here. Haha came say this. Genuinely re-read got it. There’s generally clause lease saying won’t discount rent lack amenities, sort general disturbance living situation. Totally natural virus ten yards biolab... American mentality one (on lot things one especially right now). never political. reality tv show live right now. watch conference live. governor said something along lines ""a couple new cases airport week. They've 2xx cases (meaning far)."" spit something non sensical 50% infection rate. initial reaction assume last part error previous two sentences sound right. press's reaction ask clarification start immediately spewing fear claiming 200+ cases week. Completely ridiculous interpretation every press outlet reported immediately apologize sitting back blaming governor. still wouldnt matter since heard immunity would require 70-80% population infected. balance. dog helps. think without keep us going outside, wife would much worse state. although remedy principle wrong, actual threat materialized job done collecting payment. bigger story Texas , least, pre-covid world lots going get CV die unneccesarily. Refreshing see someone enlightened actually happening America. 

The system used continue divide long others’ throats reason look everyone getting screwed over. leadership try rise squashed...this far beyond simple presidential issue reaches facets life. 

From management place employment up...work home / come offices wearing new N95s medical staff reusing mask month, know things broken. It’s happening everywhere U.S. yet nothing it. announcement didnt' shit, people already hoarded masks. start see protest infections roll around now. biggest protest/riot areas also interruptions Covid testing/reporting probably backlogged. may take couple days, weekend, spike appear publicly reported data. good paper predicting IFR African countries - 

This literally second source. least could look links fact check stuff fact checked like 30 seconds (yes, I'm referring median age think comes whether consider IFR magnitude higher normal seasonal flu, whether that's magnitude 2, 10 500, serious (at individual societal level), 'meh'. I'm sure figures throw going change other's mind that. 

I'm sure believe think coronavirus serious. gripe thing I've ever critized comments originally implied IFRs COVID spanish flu comparable. nothing thinking COVID far greater threat normal flu is. comments simply goal proving claims true. think link cited settles debate. Even lowest estimate spanish flu IFR 3x higher COVID19, source linked.

Both Bubonic plague (the virus killed third worlds population) spanish flu serious viruses. change fact bubonic plague much worse spanish flu ever was. Saying bubonic plague dangerous virus make think less severity spanish started disagreeing specifically whether pandemic remembered future anything footnote history (in fact like Asian Flu 50s/60s Spanish Flu) 

That literally never point. Maybe confusing someone, never said anything historical significance. Feel free look comments. 

You seem arguing someone else. thing relevant argument directly comment study cite, directly disproves original comments. again, support protests about, glad reform done, media suddenly pretending COVID 19 exist, covering protests, probally gave people supporting lockdown distancing measures, impression pandemic over,and caused drop guard. give Maddow credit continuing bang drum COVID 19 last weeks. someone unfortunately lives here, curious confused ""love"" country. There's nothing love see. believe necessarily giant waste time.

The waivers include details measures business taking (or promises take) reduce risk business fails follows measures presumed source infection. likely state-owned company, power utility, travelers probably exempted ""official business."" many people really remember swine flu. 10 years ago killed ~500K.

Or hong kong flu killed ~2-3 million, even knew happening *when happening*

AIDS killed millions, still ongoing mich part public discourse unless something unusual happens.

A lot people aren’t enforcing masks, really surprised customers started store it’s real situation guys locked cage 24/7 knows many years hear world might ending unimaginable happens get released prison.. they’ll make put mask.

But back point, type person sock everything me. don’t even understand many people putting risk. say something like Donald Trump president really need source common knowledge. thing here. honest facts beginning instead trying gamify everything. Thinking lie public via agencies required maintain level trust giant repercussions. Correct. Still wear mask regardless. low number reported deaths last 7 days, unfortunately surprising.

Still quite lot higher hoped for. Make mf put mask company send someone will. maintenance guy apartment luckily understanding faith community ""experts"" eroded time low around believe particular thing, soon tempted share belief employees wearing masks like fucking chin straps. issue efficacy N95s much higher probably figured better say ""no masks!"" opposed ""well, really want N95, can't get enough, maybe wear bandana might help still, little bit, kinda""

Our supply issues regard PPE really disappointing. really hope re-evaluate supply things future pandemics. really think Americans would've listened that? chance, would hoarded every single N95 surgical mask could get hands on, medical personnel would've even screwed already were. Toilet paper sold everywhere months, really think American public would've listened command hoarding medical grade masks??? chance. Nope, remember that. arent handling number rule either, lot say allow 50% capacity, actually take 100%. virus evolving. Well indication CDC site actually ""back dating data""? 

You cant look another graph say ""Well must back dating June first that's numbers would match up"".

The CDC data seems say current updated, showing different numbers people using. Yes. forgot also Alabama, North Carolina, Iowa, Tennesee, South Carolina. states delt with, going see virus expand beyond hotspots, reinfecting states brought virus control. want bunch Southern States becoming like New York State April, want New York State become like April? retard lied estimated deaths too, course. illegal use flag monetary gain.but well go sneeze whatever ye like. read this: - keep mind snopes lenient administration number year, day. know whole 6ft thing?

They’re*, one event indoors one wearing masks outdoors large majority wearing masks wonder spread at? mean, part wanting leave Britain changed :p live MN, confirm happening. We’d like think we’re good job here, we’re not. I’m going guess new spike coming soon. obviously don’t understand supply distribution chains think legitimate point Interesting. know is? There's already exponential increase infections here. We've time high cases like 5 last 7 days. This. Fauci mass murderer guys worship him. Honestly though expect. anyone comfortable going that’s one thing. states golds policy...you wear mask common area required working out. people going wear mask heavy workout session. Yeah, hard people fathom seems. least someone know dies. ""Meanwhile, Snyder said doesn’t think people worried getting virus protesting. said plans rejoin movement soon quarantine period over."" Bergamo 60% infection antibody testing, yes Midsommar, think next Wednesday look quite high well. 

Are building stash rituals? median 5 days 50%a people develop symptoms 5 less days. Add let's say worst 2 days get tested 4 days get results. That's 11 days. yeah, seen bump now. already knew this, great finally admit reason getting downvoted providing link resource back comment. meanwhile /u/ufovideo352 says feel like explaining rationale comment positive.

it's sub turned complete doomer circlejerk absolute ass. bunch insecure dumbasses. girly, man children. could get hands on

Hospitals buy masks Home Depot. Unfortunately true. Schools planning happening unfortunately, infection already started. Everyone says kids fine...but lot risk parents homes adults working schools pay price. US globally? Yeah do, it’s exactly type ‘personal preference’, it’s common courtesy. You’re exactly type victimised protected class know 😂

Bullying? calling out? 👀

‘Care wearing mask’ WHAT? 😂😂😂. Again, can’t personality. It’s something even though it’s minor minor discomfort. 

You don’t leg stand don’t care wearing masks ‘personal responsibility’, also rely society around cater needs wants. You’re beaten daily basis, nobody spits you, people stop cross road, fire department shows house fire. 

Why don’t take personal responsibility things stop expecting things you’re fine killing? I'd choose mask feeling pissed protection virus day believe infected UK couple going see dying relative. qualify compassionate release 14 days, compassionate release clause government actually taken time build medical PPE supplies medical professionals would 100% worth it. reason wasn’t worth government didn’t shit, like didn’t use lockdown time make kind contract tracing network, pretty much anything except act like bumbling idiots (which apparently people wanted judging voted for) Response bar: “Lynch’s general manager said pub reopen 11 a.m. Tuesday.” Another article link one suggests employees tested positive too.

What want know is, came first? friends bring bar contract bar? latter, bar people working sick know? Black guy pointing head. Lol faulting Chinese believing even true thing now? XD #Translation:

The number coronavirus deaths Sweden passed 5,000 Wednesday, according Swedish National Board Health. 102 new ones listed dead, writes TV station SVT. 

#There sharp increase.

#The death toll stands 5041.

The increase comes, Sweden heated debate strategy government authorities chosen corona crisis.

There also criticism Nordic neighbors closed borders Sweden Swedes opportunity vacation north neighboring countries.

The neighboring countries pointed Sweden continues many infected dead coronavirus, Denmark, Norway, Finland Iceland largely reduced daily death rates zero.

Today's new figures bad news Sweden regard. bad. Good job Sweden! ruin economy either! seems trending lower every day. Absolutely anytime spoke negatively EXPERTS surrounding president blame well, get downvoted hell. political statement defense. leaders dipshits right voting different party isn’t going change things. suppose exhert wearing mask?

If talking masks making harder breathe (might true n95/ffp2/ffp3 masks, surgical masks cloth masks that's case), HELP exert faster ? think people conflate two. wasn’t disagreeing you, point we’re getting state tourism general.  saying numbers true

Who believes official numbers point? country (Spain) deaths estimated 1.5-2 times official number we've pretty much given registering infections correctly. Apart fact many governments lying, straight impossible gather enough empyrical data say ""there exactly X deaths"" yet. We'll need time test bodies figure hell going on, right got clue. course is. worthy cause. people wearing masks blm protests. true ""I want wear mask take necessary steps avoid getting sick"" protests. Xi mostly quiet throughout whole outbreak. use think cowardly again, letting scientists doctors instead politicians getting spot light seems like good idea.

You know Xi one time visited Wuhan mostly died down? set example wore mask whole time. LIE. Well comment **116,963** 100% need vaccine. packaging comes ""wash hands eat"" advice. ""Pence also published [**op-ed Wall Street insisting verge second wave coronavirus""

To fair largely clear second wave states, current plan never let first one die off. mean try eating mask lmao. first weekend Metro Detroit bars restaurants able reopen welcome back customers, industry reporting less-than-polite behavior among customers. stem refusals wear masks. Danny's Irish Pub bartender Brook Windorf faced profanity weekend customers got huffy wearing mask, required inside Ferndale One customer goofy around plastic shield set bar's ordering station, sticking head around wearing mask. pair customers responded profanity toward Windorf asked put mask buy one bar couple dollars. Sure. 

The full study goes 2 years 10 appointments time happy come back update. noticed Minnesota reported ridiculously low infection rates riots. Green here. went drive-thru Sunday near grocery store. saw least ten people exit without masks on. Well ignorant misinformed really showing cards well Funny.. Trudeau done us statement 45 done months bunch manbabies cried wait 3 months haircut. 


A lot people live month month. can't afford work. can't afford get paycheck. aware group people fighting stop unmerited slaughtering minorities protect them. watches watchmen? do. 

George Floyd died. Still, look police records, objectively good man.

But America burns.

The dude got killed near Wendy's fought policemen, told several times stop fighting, took policeman's weapon shot. that's DRIVING intoxicated. could killed someone. Would fine?

Before say something like ""he talking police peacefully half hour"" - policemen talking him.

But Wendy's got burned. for? Really. Please tell me. fuck burn Wendy's. do? perspective moderate person strong political preferences, makes sense certainly giving rioters bonus points.

But that's all! black policeman served 40 something years incident, accounts good fair man, got killed rioters. happens? NOBODY CARES!

The world truly gone protesting lives danger. protesting lives INCONVENIENCED. know difference hard spot it’s friend. go hungry. Delivery grocery stores open entirety lockdown.

See bring psychological absurdities nothing left stand on. Oh yea man know what’s real psychological trauma? Watching president rape country grew loved. 

I dunno, think watching bunch misguided people looting burning place work/building/neighbourhood might worse. call *you* misguided *you're* social distancing, social right one thing though, you’re American. think sit sidelines outsider perspective accurately depict happening country asinine. You’re worth time downvote, far misguided.

I'm saying see, say see. Perspectives different. Truth somewhere middle. I'm willing admit that, you? feel like end Republic moment. Trump shit still voted in.

At point there's going US president corrupt enough grab dictatorship powers stay two terms support armed forces. Tennessee young people take seriously 🤷‍♂️  know 99.5% people die, Doomers keep going absolute worst case scenario? growing old. I, one, welcome new not-human overlords. Can't seem find Trump seizing buddies like OP claimed.   COVID 19 actually killed Amercians amount died first world war. think around 120 thousand Amercians died it, today. Better odds lottery, shitty reverse consequences America since hospital stay likely mean hundreds thousands dollars complications stories looks like people months long (hopefully lifelong) recoveries. point analysis, stage? Especially given source gave number cases 55,000. 

We 132 days since first Covid19 death. still first wave. Let’s wait least til first wave ends remarking month old data age lives lost. like anti-vaxxer doesn’t understand choices affect people’s health, longer choices alone. Umm, people regions figuratively jump ship? I’m tired people done everything, making kids wear masks (gasp- it’s considered child abuse area), schools better start back normal. literally two months.

Death even less viable solution. I'd honestly start checking vitamin levels. covid drive levels lower, people staying inside without taking supplements, could actually explain new joint pain.

I found hard way couple months ago joint pain symptom low vitamin blood work showed vitamin levels nearly non-existent. Pain went away supplements.

Let’s focus first wave start worrying sequel feel bad kids seen friends months, may see friends another year parents keep school fall, especially children. would guess point lot families let kids go see friends least little bit too, I'm sure there's ton jealousy kids out.

Texas big areas affected time. argument ""i feel sick, therefore can't possibly contagious.""

you third rate idiot. link sent shows flatlining cases. realize testing rapidly increased right? April positively rate 20%. far June 5%.

Also ignore deaths hospitalizations still declining nationally. Deaths going slowly hospitalizations starting totally plummet. must live OC. Covid-19 seems become snake oil race. uncorroborated claims. involved possible jail sentence large fine worked. Houston enforcing governor stuck nose notify HR. told comes back positive start showing symptoms call back. idea all. fine Saturday, called Sunday seemed ok. texted Monday mention feeling sick may been. Nah, read unbiased news make opinion

thank god spew bullshit go? people want see world burn. least overhyped virus lifetime OK. ovehyped every western government began downplay late Feb early March choice take seriously. think study needs check it’s math. 

I’m one dismiss risk virus, utter nonsense. 

Literally 98% KNOWN cases worldwide classified “mild”

And know even infected completely asymptomatic

1/3 population severe risk? Gtfo lancet Haha, problem Based though? disagree pro protest doctors, basis wearing mask indoors help prevent spread? actually thought behind it, rights things? make sense me. Wow really? missed disaster.

How many people deny ventilators? many died couldn’t access ICU care? long ago put massive field hospitals point excess capacity also used up? Wear cheap medical mask hold droplets in.  protect better serve protect others droplets. Second Wave may piles bodies streets. That's way World works. economies interconnected. Today’s economy hyper globalized. Effects shutdown never contained happen only. think places like Florida shutting doesn’t effect things like causing sudden shock price oil, poor countries like Nigeria rely main source income, don’t know global economy works days. 

Picture this: one family Florida loses business due shutdown. don’t take vacation next year Jamaica, poor country dependent tourism. Many people Jamaica miss part livelihood...etc etc... LOL thought let go? defensive snowflake.

You somehow think telling day changes fact everything diminish death 100k Americans.

You worst kind person. mass gatherings obvious potential super spreader events. case earlier Europe soccer matches found super spreader events. Re-openings lot small risk increased spread. know worse overall, think pretty obvious helping increase infections. good thing hasnt happened wont ever happen problem word ""claim"". Without data, claims useless. church LaGrande ( eastern Oregon) went 6 cases 8 days ago 240. increases 99 120 last two days.

curious many cases church know someone church. read first part, good news. Gotta positive. Ducey’s Executive Order “Stay Healthy, Return Smarter, Return Stronger.” 

Seems virus took latter two. hot Although valved masks mean they're good protecting others infected, still better nothing. Every single valved mask I've seen valve directs exhaust downwards.

On top valved masks still fulfils function protecting yourself. wear PPE properly vigilant donning doffing get infected first place valve makes difference.  really, no. able save (and critical patients) becuz could control covid without letting infection spread many people. 400 cases able keep hospitals overwhelmed thus could dedicate 100% resources cases like this.

If overwhelmed like Wuhan, Italy, US, would dead long time ago. races = ~1200 per year past year, 1,000 people killed police, according Mapping Police Violence, research group. think required people would it? require people kill other. Unfortunately work. individual must still comply. parties fault. know....

A long life lot experience taught first person call names always loser argument. They're using anesthesia residents CRNAs RTs ICU RNs. worry /s What's dipping sauce choice? _Proceeds blame Israel 1,2,..._ op-ed age well. Like milk, I'd guess. :-(  directly. Would parent company also interest freezer trucks. No, NY NJ screwed locking sooner. lockdown (and don’t robust TTI program, probably sort lockdown) want *have* lockdown.  time Dollywood open back start welcoming hordes senior park guests young unmasked rollercoaster enthusiasts. mention bills ""out network"" doctors $300 Tylenols, aggravation woken every couple hours nurse taking vitals. 

Anyone staying US hospital necessary is, definition, sufficiently deranged merit bed nearest mental health facility. people think would save day active shooter situation concealed handguns refuse potentially save hundreds people wearing mask minutes enclosed space. Well right he..your type shut anti lockdown protests ""killing"" grandma protesting fine.

Ouch think understand. 

If 100 people treated oxygen, 25 die. 

But 100 people treated oxygen dexamethasone 20 die.

In words, every 25 (or 20?) people treated oxygen dexamethasone, 1 life saved.

This also Relative Risk reduction 0.8 (20% fewer deaths i.e. 20% rather 25% fatality rate).

So stats right, different ways expressing thing. Makes sense. always presence feels like grabbed foothold. pitch idea anywhere else.

You may joking.

But there's decent chance get institualized somewhere. !RemindMe 6 months don’t need show symptoms transmit. quote WHO, keep mind CDC says false. 

The Trump defunded making claim back January disease wasn’t transmit-able people. 

Trump continuously said virus “just go away”.

Trump touted BS drugs miracle cures.

Trump caught wearing mask factory tour asked response was, “I don’t want give media satisfaction seeing wear one.”

Trump Pence say defeated virus, yet asking rally attendees sign COVID waiver (and don’t symptoms order sign it).

And lastly, Trump actually suggest consuming bleach shooting UV rays people cure virus. 

Simply put, think science fake drinking bleach stuffing UV bulbs ass solve problems. Florida #1 lets beat New York!! pharma companies.

I say original post. edit headline, make shorter. post title written passive voice. I'm saying Fauci alone failed recommend masks. methotrexate injections week kid (we home), also hurt quite bit, prescribed emla cream put hour prior, numb area, made difference. idea would work B-12, imagine probably would, might worth discussing w/ doctor possibility. Good luck everything! makes sad, I’m sorry. isn’t. many people don’t want told do. many people completely utterly selfish. It’s infuriating. people crying like babies world isn’t pre-COVID people acting like spoiled brat told wear face masks, ironically, would GET BACK NORMAL QUICKER. fifth shall named Leeloo Dallas Multipass. widespread view US control, too. Depending go, probably alright

*offer valid Arizona, Texas, Georgia Florida* ironic. Looks like understand infectious diseases work. I've got idea, listen countless doctors epidemiologists who've spent entire lives studying infectious disease instead politicians economists? saying *you* this.. getting ridiculed somebody wearing mask, I'd say ""Yeah, right"", take off, stand next them, start coughing like crazy.

..but I'm kinda asshole. Way build trust Lol you’re dense. thought wanted pay virus off. gf wants grab something eat typically get befuddled explain eating involves chewing almost grabbing? Die what? Certainly coronavirus. Hopefully you’re dumb think virus .1% death rate kill us all. knew stood told people wear lost credibility. upstate NY, unfortunately. Bars opening breeding ground virus. may take month, cases likely start snowballing again. Luckily, trust local state govt take seriously. Depends state, PA, NY downward trajectory 42 days, new spike would certainly 2nd wave, places never even saw spike 1st wave since never even shut down. purposeful. beginning May, major incident epidemiologists UofA ASU advising state said way don’t get right back exponential growth waited beginning June reopened. This, governor actually accelerated reopening timeline reopen week earlier. day told state this, fired advisement positions told stop sharing findings public. insane that? rehired public outcry, still.

If take consideration along governor government addressing outbreak, it’s obvious it’s purposeful. reopened everything around time, never enforceable safety protocols put place. Businesses whatever want; don’t follow sort guidelines. many restaurants see customers employees wearing masks—even handling food—and social distancing. state made clear going minimum amount possible. saw places like around here, would understand it’s getting bad.

It’s Arizona deliberately obscuring extent situation. thing obviously happening many states, like Florida instance.

I honestly don’t know people expected happen. could see coming mile away. It’s good.  Ok, don’t really know, explain you’re allowed watch forbidden? No, saying Jim Bakker lying.

I'm best. Thank you, though. Even movie theatres made strict usage masks, people eat popcorn drink soda? Interesting. I’d certainly like know case - PM you’d comfortable that. 

One things lot people 10 years nearing end stay - usually 30-90 days they’re Ms Ls. automatic two month extension, go 30 day extension process within PSB get another 30+60 days. It’s question mark lot folks process that.

 It’s sad many people trying claim protests spread virus. much magical thinking America days.. Gyms weird position right day saw lady public bathroom come stall gloves on, proceeded wash sink. Absolutely. top rejection science, brainwashed lifetime 'merica propaganda. enough critical thinking notice system using them. 

And current misinformation purposely spread social media domestic foreign sources made angry hell. see anger body language them. leaders speak triggering language. matter makes little sense, long elicits strong emotional reaction. Puppet strings getting pulled precisely. wearing masks.  could be? getting he's responsible saying.

He said ""we"" taking collective responsibility medical community... say that's said that's it. Important distinction. world insane, welcome. South East Asian countries wear masks time. Look well got control. honestly understand Georgia there. Seems really fishy people wearing masks anywhere. Grocery stores like 20% masks thankfully, elsewhere much. Corona virus antibodies short-lived anytime bet antibody resistance probably talking ass.

not immunity short-lived drops wildly varying rates different people means highly unstable can't rely much anything.

Antibody testing see many people gotten virus, real use determine immunity predict risk. 

you even know immune response works long antibodies last immunity talk still pretty much worthless. tried treat adults like children adults trust . 


I know message simply "" possible donating masks struggling health workers benefit us . protection matters protection fighting take care us ."" 


Easy , let people know MASKS MATTER highlight medical professionals need priority masks , even people buy expect decent number donate well . 


Lying correct move ShockedPikachu basically saying send others peoples lives like animals, mysterious suffering? euthanasia legal Sweden? Relatives person person decide take suffering not. doctors decide live die. best disposal. sub said can’t trust China’s numbers? Especially considering countries summer perfectly cardio outside. Depends entirely live. would risk transmission. new daily cases live high, risk worth better running yourself. virus suppressed risk negligible. seems precisely happen come October. Infact feel like certainty. Probably, LOT old people compared california, nursing homes run well all. coherent national response: US Senate blocked aid save state budgets. Everything that’s happened since (ie eart reopening) coherent unavoidable response one political decision. really delegate everything Fauci tell department heads give whatever needs. still speeches shit let Fauci's staff prepare remarks give. Boom. Crisis solved talk he's smart jumping this. no. idiot act like unique genius hope ignores Fauci's advice. probably take look Arizona, Lombardy, NYC, etc...this virus laid blueprint attacking, still people think threatening. Ignorance comforting, cost us lives. Current cases protests Memorial Day weekend right protests (GF died Monday) see next week’s covid numbers. wouldn’t people like fair society built imperialism, slavery, xenophobia, racism, bigotry, booze idiocracy.

2 MILLION. actual link article: yet forms media government actively telling dumbasses want hear (c.f. bleach injection man) thereby making think they're smart. economic fallout would happen without shutdowns, yes. induced.

I agree. pro mask, anti-shutdown.

But let’s keep mind lot luck optics well. People lambasting Florida’s response whole time. lambasted staying open spring break, opening beaches early. time praising Denmark response. crisis, Denmark lauded Florida criticized, Denmark deaths per capita Florida. recently passed Denmark reason, even though Denmark isn’t even recommending mask usage nobody using them. Restaurants open full capacity, advising 3 feet physical distancing US’ 6. population density well, Florida Denmark. Fucking lying sack shit. even recommend shit masks guys made us wear shirt hair ties? Well, since people actually things relation virus neither two people maybe fucking matter. Tell protestors. exactly case im at. So, right... Given US running trials Oxfords vaccine despite UK US relationship Oxfords prestige, way hell would get vaccine China (or really anywhere else) without running trials disease must send away southern border Mexico poor Mexicans must kill disease Americans must protected combat virus using fortified border wall. mean, makes sense. wants wear mask sneezed in, eww. assume political goal (of smarter politicians engineering this) get many people sick possible push herd immunity. Masks don’t help that. also hope realize ""helping 99.5%"" they'll get virus instead sacrificed 0.5% essentially sacrificed 100%. 

Take statistics class! Except people choose sex others, therefore make choice want expose STIs may have.

If rape wasn’t illegal, yeah - people forced wear condoms.

I mean everyone didn’t want wear mask forced stay home wearing mask wouldn’t issue anyone else.

Nobody asking wear mask alone home. Basically Putin team wants say. *""The units full critically-ill COVID patients,"" Saliski said. 90% Black.*

Gee I'm sure race 90% victims nothing city council's anti-science decision right? /s 70% may high, too. Truth is- one knows. likely virus would burn reaching herd immunity. Spanish Flu infected 1/3 world seemingly vanishing. Even though Coronaviruses typically mutate slower, there's evidence virus may weakening areas like Sweden Italy aka ones hit hard.

Obviously it'd wise wear masks social distance, idiotic reason people that. shame governors throwing away lives. Still, interesting conversation point. think something like half US states seeing uptick lot major hot spots still control makes look like control really is. said thing others saying 100k might die months ago, tell..

How instead focusing silver fucking linings get people ACTUALLY stay home THREE weeks shut haircuts freedom stop walking around guns threatening kill everyone asked wear mask?

Literally way solve problem make EVERYONE go home short time. Americans think that’s “impossible” instead destroyed economy benefit.

Is good idea wear mask, wash hands maintain distance? Yes. afraid? That’s bit much. Maybe there's misconception second wave going happen everywhere time. Oh see, apologies. say states’ fault counties fault. perfectly fine. /s thats lot Even Harvard expert giving snazzy soundbite.

Flu occurred almost zero international travel. 

Wrong. end WWI, considerable international travel precisely lead spread disease across world. Returning troops dispersed quickly countries. people lived rural areas. Cars almost non-existent. People rarely traveled outside village town. 

Wrong - see above. split rural urban high today, many people lived and/or worked urban areas. Wales first country world 50% population employed industry rather agriculture good 50 years WWI. comparing COVID-19 Spanish Flu pure asinine dribble. like ""Spanish Flu 2x bad"". like Spanish Flu 500x worse.

Wrong again. Current estimates case fatality rates putting par Spanish Flu - Even accounting differences demographics, least comparable serious disease. Yes, less elderly people 1918 also less younger people living chronic conditions created underlying health issues. fewer overcrowded megacities spread through. 

The world already nearly half million deaths we're six months in. 1918-19 influenza outbreak lasted year. long way yet. 

This one defining events 21st Century. 647,000 people died heart disease last year. What’s point? difference make make rich pay vaccine give free increase taxes amount? fact, latter less administrative overhead, actually cheaper. so, wrong mentality have. let guard virus pork you, don’t undo 3 months work get thinking threat gone everything What’s point study? immunity less 2 months would seen people getting reinfected infectious time 5 bars florida voluntarily closed.

Take me, Ohioan either mild symptoms symptoms all. chance antibodies would low, let’s say 1.5% (Ohio total maybe 3%). run numbers 1,000,000 people, would get following results:

982,045 (True Negative)

15,000 - Positive Pop 
3,000 (False Negative 20%)

Currently less 500 people died. I’m saying isn’t big deal, TN isn’t bad moment. little whistleblower part. popular narrative, first whistleblower Zhang Jixian Dec 27. alarm led initial Wuhan Health Commission investigation culminated warning Dec 31. never punished far know, certainly ignored.

You read early  ignore hard enough it’ll go away... level stupid US fire. Important note 50-70% new cases Lombardy -- true every day. Italy's lockdowns banned travel outside one's region peak pandemic. result, vast majority Italy -- especially south Rome -- basically serious epidemics, excess mortality. contrast, New Yorkers free travel wherever wanted -- head Miami Los Angeles ""quarantine"" -- federal government questioned whether allowed Cuomo said would ""civil war"" block travel New York. this, New York Times reported, New Yorkers seeded nation coronavirus. 

More blocking people leaving homes couple months, think Italian lockdown approach successful banned travel Italian regions. Misinformation.

Countering 500x deadlier thing (which clearly hyperbolic, whatever) clearly false interpretation doesn‘t make correct is.

Half spanish flu deaths 20-40 years bracket. Saying spanish flu death average didn‘t prevent years living covid another laughably wrong thing, matter wanna spin it.

Also, talking nationally. states nationally kept going rapidly. changing metrics.

Sadly true. 120kish deaths country this. argue precautions taken unless also argue done? get it. sure? Trump trouble walking ramp, problems pronouncing words can't even make complete sentences. Half assed lockdown, yeah. realize two things: 
 - ~3% people infected die it.
 - high infection rate leading overcrowded hospitals raising death rate much higher, worst places seen 15% Lol source? Every stream nyc 50:50 mask use best. know thats watered statement.

Is still thing? available everywhere Germany weeks now. Lol government intervene -- mandate everything shut strict protocols social distancing guidelines, reportedly people followed really well compared NA. 

With Sweden, compare similar neighbours: Finland, Norway, Denmark, see similar countries similar attitudes similar cultures react situation. 

All countries opted mandatory stricter physical distancing, three reopened one another since viruses controlled one detected case. turn around border show without passport country going reason entry fits rules. Yeah 2.5% still pretty high. great. original post coming invincible aware none us are. seem aware. Blows mind well see things like that. can’t even trust healthcare workers.

Pick expected start infected population, table give rough estimate expect things happen. put doubling time 5 days seen begin pandemic, could lower higher. Deaths strong component population composition (age mainly), comorbidities spread pattern. time probably begin younger population spread older population. ""But mah religus freadum!!"" Welsh/UK citizen, impression America becoming worse since this. UK shamefully act fast enough (I told work place working home 2 weeks shut office) got hit hard atleast seem quite reasonably keeping distance wearing PPE. Even checkouts plastic shielding.
But see Americans kicking fuss petty things time - even massive recorded deaths - really makes feel bad people know better. really feel that, like myself, respect threat want keep others safe untill overcome it.
Truly mind boggling. People seem need reminded constantly people researching vaccine China smart brilliant hero’s want best world, it’s like Xi Jingping mixing chemicals That's good news least! Well told people still social distancing  understand saying here. agree people would've hoarded masks lie told? Clearly important. That's using it. Lol right, useless reference point. here. apartment building rent risen $110 annually last 4 years. really thought ""Oh due everything, raise more. even knocked $80 $1075 rent 3 months now"".

&amp;#x200B;

Then nopeeeeee. see sign outside building listing new rent $1250. 2 months new rate hits us. one room studio insane nearly price throughout area. way find $900 place renting small room house, almost places require live solely room (aka usage house social rooms kitchen).

&amp;#x200B;

I glad everyone else's rents going down.... SoCals.... thoroughly support mask wearing, requirements them, paper ain't it. shoddy science, here's one expert [debunking here's want advocate masks mask requirements, here's much better document I'm glad arent extending $600 dollar bonus. error penalized still working many people making unemployed working WalMart risking health. Add that, ton job opening rough work sectors (pizza places fast food) cant fill positions people dont want return work. better way stimulate economy giving unemployed punishing work. governor go date... That's really good point Yeah there’s basically comparison. also much closer running beds. country really circle jerk chaos. I'm really stumped done (while waiting vaccine) everyone would willing do, slow spread? 
Ironically, freedom one primary drivers spread.
I wonder person/group, gain people's attention make realize need work together, us alive tomorrow.

As sit type this, think teens-20 something, powerful voice, motivate other, groups well. People may like it, future leaders. Heck old farts today it, get power youth shot. Fan =/= blind obedience Yep. study sailors infected aboard aircraft carrier separate study old people cruise ship Japan confirms vast majority cases require hospitalization. aircraft carrier's case, one fifth sailors report symptoms. 2 287 sailors tested positive required hospitalization kind. 

For cruise ship Japan, believe mostly elderly people it. 712 tested positive, 14 died. Please tell Best Death Metal Band love them.  Good! 99% dont die.. 

Just know, that's astronomically high number respiratory disease. Something like 10x higher seasonal flu, less contagious, vaccine for. Holy shit guys lazy. 

[Here 4,500 **recovering** coronavirus patients sent New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes controversial state directive ultimately scrapped amid criticisms accelerating nation’s deadliest outbreaks, according count Associated Press. 

This first thing comes google ""ny sent recovering covid patients nursing homes"" Yeah, wearing mask without covering nose great. mask might catch cough sneeze, air/moisture/virus come nose time.

I see people wearing gloves adjusting masks, taking gloves putting again. see people take masks outside, transferring possible contamination hands gloves. There's lack training general.

On hand, use gloves masks least shows awareness transmission virus. Poor glove usage may make less effective good glove usage, little bit improvement wearing gloves.

The PH folks problem: virus first started spreading, recommended people wear masks, first, short supply, second, said using mask would lead transmission hands face people adjusting masks. And, N95 masks, need fitted tightly effective. difficult train everyone put take gloves masks hospital. do? Tell people wear masks gloves, knowing thew likely cross-contaminate? Tell people wear them, hope best? Tell everyone need take 15 30-min video class masks gloves? Mexico backwards, prices going really fast, theres guys got overpriced apartments houses, make airbnb.

Now one renting theyre trying rent month, high prices got really expensive mortages theyre fully furnished.

Other people apartments house see prices,and raise accordingly, apartment like mine( 2bd) went US $220 month $400 month, (minimum wage 300 month), guy trying rent house $250us per day sell whole property 200k, even mentioned got 250 6 months ago. $100/month increase year California. Every year. stay place raise like $50 ever move paying $100 x however many years since last moved extra. made money this? live, millions desire live there. Supply demand. Danish TTI wasn’t really raging success story till now. it? 10 100 cases traced? think posted article (and made Sweden per usual). Hopefully Denmark bettered now. Good work. Kind sad requires much explanation obvious. /u/GovSchwarzenegger Thank setting great example encourage people mask up! raised rent June. Actually, Njere right. say ""there's evidence linking protests second wave"" 

there's evidence procuring evidence prohibited collecting it, case. 

cunning, really rent $500? $15 would 3% industry standard. around 1%,which agree high. hospitals end getting overwhelmed, could see happen. that's cheap room Another thing many events cancelled postponed. Things people would spend money new clothes, gifts, jewelry cancelled. three friends whose official big wedding (300 person type) postponed small, immediate family weddings outside. 

Vacations cancelled. Art sales cancelled. Pretty much last 3 months cancelled summer too. Yes, there's always risk, short doomsday bunker. meltdown shut shudders society every fatal risk, quite society. people actually read articles headlines? Testing still ramped quite significantly quicker. visit flu results. testing still behind many aspects increased randomly needed quicker results contact tracing.

Thearaputics. finding new stuff everyday. Eventually stuff helps. Along testing relax stuff catch early reduce severity length time.

Social distancing still impacts long term. Everyone wants give easily, without vaccine still alot new practices avoid spread. nothing approach. 

People need stop impatient selfish everyone get creative find new ways assess risk. winter could significant issue adjust summer shown outdoors significantly less impact.

People wear mask random people (it's honestly end world), need concerts jammed pack full people, huge sports gatherings every state location. 

As testing ramps possible reduce things more, people wear mask less. testing numbers could controlled, therapeutics could become like Illneses.

With around 20 different vaccines tested, aspect could 1-3 years possibly. Again, sucks adapt, nothing! one three selfish idiots, every damn one crowds Walmart every afternoon like herds feral pigs.  would one 5 densely populated cities US

Well that's true all, it?

Here's population densities Stockholm even close list. thanks moved apartment similarly jacked rent. went discuss lady office explained started attracting younger affluent residents instead retirees raised rent. 

She talking me. raised rent moved in. person 60 apt complex. people it, less people spread slow down. 70% herd immunity complete eradication disease. people immune slower spread. seeing NYC sure understand. everyone trying move July? Plug /r/loseit! Mission accomplished. sold entire supply. /s I’m sure. Ton death NY early doctors quick go ventilator. quickly hit densely packed large city America. firestorm. know lot more, treatments available. don’t think 200k August happen. Mickey, Police Department. investigators analyzed urine sample concluded Goofy pee'd Mickey Sucks outside house, Minnie's handwriting. Yeah elevation masks thing Sweden today daily cases deaths per million countries hit hard even space buring corpses.

Not admitting ICU elderly good way keep ICUs free. actually hospitalize people prevent death. let die home nursing homes exactly happened areas got situation control.

Sweden time examples good job like norway did. Unfortunately strategy (and is) total disaster.

This narrative typical people problem alcohol. sooner realize problem better. first step fix problem admit problem.  Correct. timing could coincidence.

Although published yet. researcher coming saying big news. Researchers coming ahead publication happens sometimes.

See, thought published too. study peer reviewed yet. Although numbers patients controls seems like fine. Sometimes studies get math wrong though...

My worry control age health patients. cannot compare 50 yo dex treatment survivor 75 yo without treatment survive. Always match controls patients. randomized controls. even considering going airport? would right. thinking, morning, Asian countries animosity toward us even need declare war us. We'll kill weaken ourselves. kind think they're laughing us, right now. I'm Dallas well boat. shit fucked surefire way make sure okay anything.

My building mgmt refused budge. signed renewal. could likely contract covid, hear you.

My insane level obsession contract covid hopefully help avoid medical research continues 

So far I:
-Fought really hard stay working remotely

-Grocery shop weekday mornings small unpopular market 

-shower immediately basically going anywhere wash clothes

-wipe everything perishable enters home

-wipe non perishables let sit outside day sun

-have went camping fiance outside house

-only wear N95 (painters masks work) KN95 masks basically everywhere

-never use common exit building

-purchased car contactless manner (i ubered everywhere past life)

-avoid people costs

-packages sanitized wearing mask packaging never enters home

-wash hands often dry fuckin awful 

Basically, yes may get covid kind think odds avoiding illness better most. Uh sorry break March 3 months ago think testing improving 100% sensitive doesn’t mean 100% test results accurate. [Here’s includes troubles testing, including failure tests UK detect lower levels antibodies. There’s risk young people infected older family members showing symptoms start seeing influx older people getting hospitalised next week two. Yeah, sums fairly well Laughs Texas 2750 sqft 4bd 3ba 1850/mo certainly skewed, going much lower mean. 

But, want calculate total YLL due COVID, easiest take mean multiply number deaths. least NY got shit together prevented worst case scenario. chucklefucks give two shits

You mean Cuomo de Blasio said everything would okay go restaurants bars support local businesses? NY?   agree immunity lasts it’ll pretty much burn then, you’ll see occasional outbreak county county English 3rd least important language, you? Second council member tested positive. 🤦🏼‍♀️ spreading NYC since least January. pretty self evident many cases suburbs imported commuters working city, especially beginning community spread took hold. I'm aware, thank clarifying point What's point wearing mask restaurant take eat drink? Agree early TTI could avoided lockdown measures, least strong ones. 

Worldometers shows countries mentioned testing decent amounts. super high like Denmark anything pretty good. 

Antibody tests really accurate enough useful research purposes imo. Uncle welfare would always throw rich dad slur. Cousins would think fancy clothes came cheap stores mall their's came Goodwill. ton jealousy Uncle tried argue dad need inheritance parents died already ""rich"".

🧛🏼 Repeatedly riding motorcycle without helmet far dangerous living day day life without concern catching coronavirus.

I taking calculated risk. Let's say there's 100% percent chance catch it. healthy 30 year old, little chance die (&lt; .1%). higher chance hospitalized bad time, relatively unknown risk long term complications. I've decided benefits hanging friends, going bars restaurants, living life unconcerned catching virus outweigh potential risk described above.

That seems calculated far stupid. Los Angeles, 1,900sq foot townhome tiny backyard two-car garage $750k. suburbs, 30 miles north city. Unreal. Yeah, definitely bad news, thankfully they're even open yet, going think July 11. knew things going done, knew needed wait DeSantis reopened Florida economy see stupid we'd get. got stupid. Florida trended upward cases since days started easing restrictions. We've set record record cases per day last week. Maybe that's people getting tested, think death rate flattening instead continuing drop really bad sign.

Disney knew. Universal Orlando SeaWorld already open. close I'll surprised. world fucked. us takes lot credit it. well, pretty much 'developed' world does. would funny idiots taking money us people eat shit like that... impossible, different. reproduction number well one, meaning virus limited spread. also one highest populations antibodies, limited susceptible.

The truly miserable thing scenario near total isolation since March - killed her. literally gave life since visit half deaf blind, Zoom etc useless. finally allowed visit day died - comatose yet one person allowed visit *for full day* 15 minutes. ended watching father sit beside glass window died of, essentially, loneliness. 

Meanwhile talking people work there, none tested. 

It's fuckin' backwards. “Through extensive research, determined weather modeling could potentially explain spread COVID-19, making possible predict regions likely higher risk significant community spread near future.""

That “could” concluding statement important.

Argentinian I'm worried making things worse us. TBH; find hard believe one fully-equipped gym inside home. Nothing beats role modeling. Thank supporting community acting keep others safe. How? agree, think everyone public right without mask selfish POS. can't handle it, work out. lot people saying it'll go away April warmer weather. It'll like miracle. Aye, Tesco one way paths aisles arrows floor, people pay attention that? course not. Ask way.

Is Trump really starved attention ok risk possibly thousands lives ""rally""? yea it‘s implying gym following rules arnie isn‘t. isn‘t case. can‘t really blame gym imposing stricter rules too. though. Everyone wear mask right halt spread dramatically. There' nothing stopping them. That's systemic issue lot option wear mask personal one something everyone choose now. Kinda like US funerals limited 10 people 2 weeks later 10k attend one problem probably better mental health way. Time move next phase reopening then... bars generate billions dollars 
also millions people really care one bar Dang, realize even 4th graders using Reddit days. corona patients also consume prodigious amounts medications sedation/paralysis ventilators. NYC actually ran frontline medications purpose went second tier paralytics sedatives Putin 67 participate regularly Zoom wine beer tastings. new normal. protests really interesting. know seen cases linked protests, haven’t seen spikes Sorry really commenting difference numbers high numbers. seniors extremely vulnerable too, despite healthcare system. states wont like NYC....the population density nowhere near same.....anyone truly wants say ignoring basic fact kind knew matter time infections first started cropping U.S., make less disappointing. somehow politicized reckless asshole. Flu b.ootlickers Every protest went near universal mask usage amongst protesters. knew WW3 would virus would lose badly due ignorant people refusing wear masks distance couple months. suck.  ...and loling survive don’t! Right. 20% May 1 data get it! Lol downvotes. original context comment Pumping Iron! true bodybuilding fan. Vote man back up! Arnold awesome. Thanks sharing. don’t think tell crowd wear damn mask. it. 

For avoiding gyms posted full home workout beginning crisis. I’m great finding links I’m sure one geniuses share it!  Trump looks far better shape simply colors hair. He's overweight walks like old man. 

It surprising though hear lifestyle. This. Coming South Carolina consensus frustration shutting don’t really high rates infection. idea slow spread since barely cases nothing happens. Hospitals empty due invasive surgeries cancelled covid cases. MUSC actually laid nurses off. 

We shuttered closing North East infection rates rise addressing risk hospital overload. 

Now people fed pain lockdown said screw it. people consigned risk means stability income, work freedom. 

I think people talk think virus pretty hyped ready go heard immunity strategy. playing devil's advocate here, vaccine delayed never comes fruition? appreciate trying mitigate risk much possible, wonder collective risk tolerance go point. See Sweden think second peak come about? find factually wrong comment first replied to? saying ""it's fault"", addressing specific case people putting minor conveniences safety others.

Yes, virus spreading many Americans *is* fault Americans spreading virus. spread itself.

Yes, British walking around saying ... *because they're still lockdown*, badaboom. top rated comment yet completely veritably false. 500 past week, 2 positive. 260 since beginning March total. Number tested get 260 specified.

 gonna smartass say put seat down, saw thumbnail...  referring something specific?  Maybe defected coronavirus‘ ranks? valid point Herd immunity mean virus ceases exist nobody got sick, means enough people population immunity prevent virus spreading enough become epidemic. problem pre-vaccine herd immunity wore every years susceptible people born immune people lost immunity died.

Measles epidemics every years example, periods lower spread between. certainly allowance isnt going allowed anymore, regardless NZ citizens. important thing remember released level 1, level 2, 3 4, conditions release stringent enforced correctly. never given private car, chauffeured measures contact safety place meeting relatives controlled environment return quarantine. course would unneeded tested compassionate leave granted. True. One steals articles sites make easy money. Original story posted telegraph Yeah. feel like many people opinion nursing homes never one. 

They depressing, hopeless places. people biding time waiting die. good portion people long death. mean, think that's *extremely* unlikely. human disease we've ever eradicated smallpox, see would like smallpox (the first disease could inoculate against) vs every disease we've able vaccinate against. bit extreme?

they're likely get better own, need send slaughterhouse cause they're infected Message save lives: propaganda

Failed herd immunity: Swedish excellence... mention many potential vaccines works. masked/obeys rules.

How eat mask on? Lol, people aren’t going go it. Isle Man, 'rona free 4 weeks cases, virus got one nursing home counted 19 24 deaths. recorded diagnosed cases younger people though. shows ruthless old people. girl lives like hour away me! It’s scary. Even videos looting Soho people wore N95 masks. think NYC rest tri state area blockaded rest country point, save rest us.

All along saying things like “oh that’s big city problem don’t population density get large cluster” they’re claiming it’s Miami, among LatinX population. Exactly. live Florida almost one wears mask. Americans basically allergic anyone forcing anything (no matter is). make big deal wearing masks, refuse. ""While increased hospital occupancy raise concerns, state’s hospital capacity remains “the lowest threat level,” Abbott said. “We plenty room expand beds, thousands hospital beds available speak right now,” said""  mean suggest US completely fucked up, pandemics always killed far war. WW1 especially: US incredibly small number deaths. Asia take care parents home. lowers risk significantly. Definitely case - never asked anything, never complained about, always paid rent time. Studies shown China Italy Europe contain young/mild cases never going get ahead disease. 

Of course USA past disease, economy mah freedhom individualistic spoiled society. 

Easier forget something. 

Not enough people dead Americans care. directly effected, care. hahahahahaha bahahahhahaa bahahahahahhahaha stupid people win stupid prizes Funny story keeps changing... keep told herd immunity strategy Swedish government trying slow spread virus.

Now hear surprised virus spreading faster can't figure isn't?

They told us ""flattened curve""... obvious reason spread fast? lying always knew spreading faster telling us?

Seriously, pick story stick it... either Swedish government successfully slowed spread virus ""flattened curve"", infections spreading unchecked low antibody numbers surprise... way inject body? told USA TODAY Network could missed patients died COVID-19 February early March testing limited then.

So counting deaths presently, months testing available . Got it. I, too, thought dead. Guess got mixed another huckster. agree, hopeful sign Minnesota hasn’t shown spikes yet two weeks since protests started late May there. media outlets government officials said protests “could” “may” lead spike (not gaurentee), really hoping outdoors mask usage (pretty high NYC) mitigated potential spikes. also treatments developed make effects virus far less dangerous. 

But either way, dine-in restaurant necessary, ever. present example. fear mongering point phenomenon correct afraid of. 

Very kids drown pools, statistically. fear mongering warn parents extremely attentive children swimming, absolutely happen.  Lol people forget 100% New York saying got porked too. Apparently really “it’ll never happen us” mentality Damn cousin got admitted hospital Houston coronavirus. three roommates, normal, be. Recoveries general seem little tricky keep track of. I've seen, places even track recoveries first, sudden see surge recoveries. recoveries seemingly slow awhile, surge cycles. ""Masks worn times, except, know, sitting table.""  wonder people throwing tantrums - rules make fucking sense all. same.

But fair younger version ourself, US declined lot recent years. lot people holding selling right now. Looking recent article zillow listings definitely vs previous summers.

A big reason allowed show homes still occupied due COVID-19. Well, pretty much know exactly I'm from, I'm even closer hotspot guess.

Anyhow, measures adequate apart full quarantine, know.

Our measures alright accordance law.

Ventilation good. gym super small. Like 90 squaremeters so. Front door fulky opened one two giant vents (I look ceiling lot).

When train, 2 people working tops, plus two owners walking around sometimes, though masks.

I'm often completely alone there. workplace considering using one fogger/mister devices disinfect large spaces. good? long take ""mist"" ventilate area? want breathe stuff! Thanks. 80% humans die start yourself. change want see. keep taking precautions indoor spaces large numbers people. live traditional lifestyle Arizona (own house, car) relatively safe, provided stupid. link tell highest risk situations are:

 everything government says fact huh? Damn must one idiots believe Trump's bullshit believe original suggester referencing US government, virus itself.

At least been. Exactly. parents taking care grandmother paying sister's college working full time pandemic. 60s. 

They trying arrange extended family take turns grandma sick left alone. major undertaking entire family working full time, going school raising children. that's one grandparent! rest gone. got sick would try home care. got dementia would need professional help outside home.

We used live two houses block. live place. owner restaurant made mask wearing voluntary staff. thinks looks bad business wearing them. I'm one wearing one looked like Im idiot. large elderly community. Currently looking new job. quit! Yeah saw someone managed link working tweet. People continents traitors. saying ""lol sides"" matters, amirite?

It's almost like cautious often best choice even turns unknowns favor. Texas always big ""While increased hospital occupancy raise concerns, state’s hospital capacity remains “the lowest threat level,” Abbott said. “We plenty room expand beds, thousands hospital beds available speak right now,” said"" could also solution older family care childcare crises. 

It would absolutely wreck commercial office real estate sector, though, you’re going see strong pushback people financial stakes area. early epicenters seen second spike yet. Im gonna say forbidden word “herd immunity” close, spared second wave? surprising considering pensultucky (west philly, east pitt) full morons...  god sake man don’t give virus ideas! No. Look threads Sweden New Zealand basically country. see top comments ste respective countries discussed.

And top comments US threads Americans stupid. hate wearing masks. ""disappear April"". Hey fuckhead. supposed read anything past headline. /s Wow. like Elon Musk, huge fan Tesla SpaceX, I'm stupid enough think Elon Musk ""doesn't need money"", serious? 13 years old? Could suck dick harder? course wants money, noticed every tweet makes reference stock market? think that's cares human civilization? Theres billionaire planet want ""more money"". Tesla go under, think would negatively impact estate fortune? Good god dumbest argument I've reddit long time.

Instead blindly following anybody money you, maybe try looking data drawing conclusions. Yeah, keep mind hospitalizations typically lag 2-3 weeks. We've already guaranteed increasing hospitalizations weeks new lockdown.

As noted elsewhere, rate hospitalization equal NY locked - look much worse got there. fear mongering comes people expecting happens please post Yeah types dying go bar first ones opened again. suspicious, jaded anything, lot stories jump conclusions based teenager says? Public health officials lied severity Covid 19, fact. Billions funneled support social distancing studies. Yet public health officials advocated BLM protests saying important systemic racism, prove nonsense. Masks nothing viruses. known dental community primary factor good health even factor, strong immune systems proven biggest factor disease prevention pathogen infection.

Then think quote anatheiest

""Even hand-washing isn’t obvious solution seems.  A much-quoted study American Journal Infection Control reported that anesthesiologists nurse anesthetists poorly compliant with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines hand hygiene (HH).  However, full compliance guidelines impossible.  An average 149 “HH opportunities” identified observers hour anesthesia care.""

Think this. pertains clinical setting, rules apply homes, work place, grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants etc

Its essentially saying , impossible wash hands enough prevent pathogen exposure deemed enough get sick. 

On top this, pathogens reemerge hour cleaning. cant bleach home every hour, would probably make sick. impossible clean enough prevent pathogen exposure deemed enought get sick.

Think dirty cell phones people worried droplets people! according mentality Swedish subreddit we(Sweden) beat COVID! lmao believe, random redditor ER chief know say, first succeed, try, try again. Yall said crazy saying spike would happen following protests... protests... week later... spikes around US...

I'm wizard guess. Source? Proof impending “2ND WAVE”? work well Italy...... way works supposed address **BEFORE** run hospital beds ICU capacity. apartment complex gave increase plus first 6 weeks free. awesome deal. funny part bet whiners thread supporting protests. number reported Tuesday triple number June 5th, hmmmmmm happening? take long get posted hear? 

All seeing usa. What's alternative? Housing going go there's demand. build accommodate demand.

Some things like Amazon moving downtown Seattle bringing 40,000 high paid employees want live nearby absolutely result higher rents there's much it. Also, 2010 still recovering recession. So, prices abnormally low start with.

Other areas lower demand see prices drop. parent's old house midwest changed value since sold early 90s. effect, worth ~1/2 worth back thanks inflation. Absolutely! Hope helps! idiot think smart. willfully ignore facts spin doomsday scenario keep others afraid. Yeah, US apartheid state monopolistic robber barons buying political system point history WW2 

America mix violent shithole apparently verge collapse world leader many ways long time now. Sounds alchemic Pretty sure viruses can’t vote. Like things though, it’s educated guess. world’s largest field hospital going constructed. I'm honestly impressed California fucking ip badly, well. course would. problem fixed. overwhelming ***consensus*** professional medical community facemasks provide benefits preventing covid spread. 

Having consensus mean correct - simply means opinion majority vote. Justin Bieber may one biggest selling artists time mean shit - means he's popular. Donald Trump president mean right choice, majority choice. 

There solid science back drive wear masks. purely political based opinion experts. point is, something made mandatory, onus making mandatory prove effective. 

Why? 

Because otherwise, we're slippery path told things government simply say right thing do. that's one step away banana arse. using little science fact herd immunity exists encouraged some(I’m sure it’s debated topic comes covid clear right wrong answer(only speculation theories) whether herd immunity possible encouraged) sunlight good disinfectant children lower risk adults. it’s really bad science please find strong evidence it. never said masks don’t help social distancing bad kids never get transmit it. Everything else opinion government handling measures taken. putting anyone danger stating opinion making laws don’t know care I’m almost positive that’s sin Took hit nearly capacity days. Everything normal, masks, except crowds 1000. payments deferred employee salaries subsidised state, many fold need strong summer break even. 70% people say travel summer holidays domestic tourism could speed recovery. That's insane. Place moved raise rent years lady decided wanted start raising $5 year lol. 

Obviously complain goal people die horribly. Flattening curve first, obvious move effort.

After flattening curve idiots started thinking meant restrictions changes lifestyle. tens thousands lives saved wearing masks, example, still even hospitals overwhelmed. supposed rise challenge find ways business practicing harm reduction herd immunity established vaccine.

Also even thing care hospitals overwhelmed, made crystal clear public shut things reach certain point. made clear. There's certain degree truth here. know whether true cases actually going look like they're going increased testing, important keep mind cases numbers highly, highly dependent number tests conducted. statistician Nate Silver (who *not* fan current administration, FYI) going lot lately Twitter: 
 providing context increase testing basic error, widespread, revealing media's goals. interested telling plausibly-true stories (""narratives"") sound smart audience accuracy/truth per se. mean making stuff engaging fake news. contrary, facts relays generally accurate isolation. problems facts strung together emphasized. Often sins omission (e.g. context testing). 
 BTW, Trump figured out! focusing case counts, media creates disincentives testing makes numbers look superficially worse. One reason (not one) we're pushing testing much 
 misleading b/c testing roughly doubled past month non-NY states 2x testing, find lot cases. true numbers turned around NY, story states may encouraging chart implies.
 Experts estimate something like 1 10 coronavirus *infections* turning confirmed *cases* US. long that's case, number confirmed cases going sensitive much testing we're doing.
  positive test rate falling, know LEAST one two GOOD things happening.
Either infections falling we've figured widespread testing, both.
 Conversely, focusing raw case counts sometimes make GOOD news (more tests!) look like BAD news quite often, increase detected cases reflects increase testing, even disease steady/declining. That's huge 
 greatly expand testing—something CRUCIAL reopening SAFELY—and bunch news articles slam state finding cases result tests, they're actively misinforming people creating disincentives lol thought space aliens scheduled October. bad news, last long:

Basically, everyone faithful gets eternal life super special ones get go hang God's house. Absolutely. prepared blamed anything next year npc Thank correction. still expect trend continue. Either way, we're talking n=1 here. I'd love expert input bigger picture. Look [Roosevelt 60% antibodies 59% *of those* neutralizing antibodies. specimens couple months infection.

Blood hands. fucking loved turned around like ""wat?"" actually suggesting protesting mask social distance better going supermarket, bar restaurant without mask. Frankly speaking, belief irrelevant, required.

Not saying never ever spent moment 24 hour cycle health risks, less afterthought. ones likely die anyways, COVID-19 not? Look he’s acted year alone. He’s completely butchered corona response continues so. forcefully clearing streets peaceful protestors photo op church, holding bible, upside mind literally threatening people America? He’s stopped even talking Fauci virus, plans holding rallies current hot spots doubt cause cases looks like bumbling idiot anytime opens mouth. isn’t even getting nonsense circus spews regularly Twitter. 

You’re right don’t know fact, *do* know virtually everyone life voted 2016 disgusted said there’s way hell they’re voting time around. We’re also midst crisis that’s likely way worse November thanks small part actions, national crisis always advantage challenger...not sitting president. 

We’ll see. I’ve usually got pretty decent grasp stuff, even saw Trump winning 2016 media saying Hillary like 98% chance winning it. things stand don’t see feasible way winning November landlord, way hell upping rent right now; last thing want look new tenant middle pandemic. I'm sure give in, won't. avoid temptation lower risk activities partake in. Like maybe shop stores occasion. Maybe. eating restaurant very, long time. 

On upside saving so.much.money shopping eating meals out- even though cost groceries gone quite bit. oh, can't see people smile. weaklings. I’m gonna guess milder close relative disease circulating time, came went within last years. People made that, thinking bad cold mild case flu, getting virus without excessive immune response inflammation.  killers, virus. 

Beyond that, there’s threshold illness varies person person, vast middle range severity getting presented binary based upon subjective assessment personal illness, willingness seek medical help hospital. 

In US we’re seeing numbers new diagnoses hold steady, deaths declining. time that’s going give us fuller picture normal case COVID, common, severe mild cases fitting profile based upon age, preexisting conditions uncertain element, probably prior immunity. Depends flavor Christianity. believe they'll taken heaven beginning rapture, believe they'll live it. fucking grifter bullshit. propaganda corporate chodes 10% infection rate among tested today. Chances catch it. Sorry flunked high school math.  Same. live Silicon Valley even $130k/year salary, can't afford buy house here. plan move Portland lease next year houses cost half (and even less half) houses here. Brazil people suburbs commute city? care hologram ya think heard 20 ft more, conservative. 

And news well, heard friend works University Washington scientist researching treatment COVID19 again, education fault. 

True need true history arts critical thinking. 

Its true teachers input even assigned distorted materials approved Texas subsequently country. 

Racism existed since existence USA. also existence written word.

You seem made system. parents enlightened. Many siblings right wing nutjobs. I’d gladly go back work job merely furloughed. Instead, employer saw opportunity “trim fat”; save laughable $26k year business makes much day two...
So, unless state (Florida) actually grows brain ensures safety going back workforce - almost certainly “front-line” position since that’s type jobs somewhat available - rather stay safe house actually receive assistance unemployment first time life life-saving PUA (which also ever “made”, sadly). Poor lady. understand complete lack respect people one another. trying get subletters, landlandy going agent increased price $200. get keep paying doesn’t find anyone. Cold Texas too? Providing additional $600 week unemployment insurance partly incentive/assurance encourage people stay home. goal couple months ago reduce spread virus, keep people working unsafe conditions looking supplemental income. average Boomer 62. average American man live 76, average American woman live 81. Shit ain't going happen 14-19 years now. Reopening dumbass states doing, reopening sane states two entirely different things. Sane states watching data, sustained day day drop cases, start gradually open certain services carefully, strong social distancing, universal masking, lower capacities, watching numbers every day. get rise cases step backward reopening phases. fine, social distancing masking meant even hiccup continual drop numbers. track full reopening, masks social distancing.

Insane states saying fuck it, letting everyone whatever want spread virus everywhere. that’s absolutely scary.

i hope y’all reach soon. Narrator: ""He right"" brilliant! Yes actually bad investment, settling down.... moved US tropical country cannot get used humidity Florida 😂. Helth here's works:

First, there's surge cases;

Then, there's surge hospitalizations;

Finally, there's surge deaths. 

That's order things. Good making statement. 
I presume Arnold gym home? Must go local gym variety. mean protest going month so. COVID going least 4 number protesters getting COVID still doesn’t say much.

Educate yourself. Currently criss crossing Texas last weeks. Went Houston El Paso back last weekend. left morning Houston Amarillo pretty much stop every Bucees (Madisonville, Ennis, Katy). I’d say 90 percent aren’t wearing masks. It’s frustrating I’m dreading fallout already that. It’s sucked. anymore... 2020 turning around! HOPE. satisfied deliveries now.

And yes, know virus March. debate. Good make sure accurate data available. applicable California? Testing definitely going tracker, although looks like outpaced positive cases disappointing. seem like rapid increases big cities though, something. think Bay Area figured things early, LA seems least holding steady, although still ways go bring things down. CA probably borderline OK things getting worse, really going vary state side line on.  Extremely chilled environment protect meat. i.e. Working refrigerator. like pumping numbers keep us scared 🤪 

That's moronic theory. Lower numbers would make look better, far likely act incompetence malice. clear, cities, rent increase due housing shortages.

I’m sure enough people get flu herd immunity really factor in. suppose also depends infectious disease is. said, still wouldn’t say it’s “delusional” (quoting poster responded to) someone think “partial” herd immunity flu/similar strains flu might effect.

Escher think two fields merged way Obstetrics gynecology been. Psychiatry Neurology. Thanks. friend boarded United flight Florida NYC today said flight attendants board wearing masks improperly (noses hanging “best”, attendants masks hanging chin exposing entire face...). Social distancing also enforced, passengers instructed wipe seats disinfectants without specific guidelines offered surfaces specifically take care wipe down. know people different understandings means clean something, many passengers vaguely wiped arm rests whereas others scrubbing every nook cranny surroundings. Attendants actively overseeing passengers clean seats enforcing mask wearing policies. asked friend take videos hope share flight lands. 

THIS OK!!!! Maybe Bernie done best country endorse UBI flip flop it.

[Bernie Sanders Flip Flops Position Universal Basic Man hope so. adore San Francisco 10 years - home point - absurdly expensive. Well month ago told experts FLA NYC. never happened. could go twitter right pull dozen frantic threads better things do. 

We’ve people protesting streets three weeks now. course protests led increased spread. I’m skeptical going lead surge deaths. may wrong. start seeing soon. Thats it?? mother fucker billionaire.. Imagine lying teeth make chud like Donald Trump look good...also...Imagine Donald Trump black. I'm México, masks mandatory store (grocery stores, clothing stores, etc) allowed wearing one.

What's goal this? None accident. two main mechanisms immune response, humoral (antibodies), cellular immunity (t-cells). cases, people confirmed CV19 recovered show antibodies tested, especially less severe illness require (or seek) medical attention. 

What means people become infected recover virus without knowing infection evidence ever infected. may well countless people woke one day last months, feeling 100%, entire COVID19 experience. national law enforced police.

Or, alternatively, watch accept OP end SOL. Nothing life necessary except food water. Let's holed rooms fed like hamsters rest lives. least we'll safe! cases LA county, parts California starting slowly increase. 

I’m Northern California commute back forth Capitol Bay Area work. counties Bay Area taken things seriously, made mask mandatory. see lot mask counties. away get bay though, you’ll see 25-50% people wearing mask. Social distancing becoming less. 

My prediction new hot spot surrounding areas bay, aren’t taking precautions. let clarify don’t actually predict issue, think enough African American volunteers United States substantial black, educated middle class population. discussion theoretical.

I understand hesitation, don’t understand making big decisions based entirely surface level information. Making good decisions requires people look deeper mechanics what’s happening real time. Maybe Yang endorsed Bernie Biden. dementia elderly longer purpose life ship nursing home? jump ethnic cleansing? want people color cease exist, want control use them. Same, went first week February, cases yet. assuming people develop antibodies either exposed exposed developing antibodies reason prior immunity protection it.

Whereas appears based statistical analysis percentage population sort prior protection even need develop antibodies.

Two different things difference important. I'm confused, however, someone get illness, recover, develop antibodies contribute herd immunity. also someone even get first place exposed prior protections also contributing herd immunity. What's wrong vaccination? Funny, comments here. Wonder why? Imagine story actually, ""Orlando Airport CEO speaks actual positive test case count 500"". raise rent years go by? guess someone could argue inflation but??? cost living goes still seems like we’re making same..

Blame 5G/dems/Chinese/minorities it. many people either losing jobs working home due shutdowns, many tenants chosen leave apartments behind major US cities. 

So, becoming homeless becoming van dweller then. I'm leftist live US lmao Sorry, don’t assume every journalist, editor, whoever mega corporation best intentions prioritizing providing best information making money sensationalism, high standard making sure they’re very, clear they’re saying. happening California, rest us stand chance. Meanwhile I've asked renewal contract three times keep forgetting. -\_- New Braunfels majority people wearing masks, older. guess try scapegoat protestors youth. like bothering others I've called mocked street putting mask high enough nose saw holler friend afar wearing one immediately complied, ashamed :s

The single biggest reason idiots act like president said he's special wear one. since many think they're special too,...

If dictators start wearing US president doesn't, something wrong, man. heart crushing see Xi Jinping parading mask everywhere make population follow, see Trump like narcissist entitled buffon :'( perspective... 435,000 people died covid-19 *globally* less year.

No. 435,000 sum current official death tolls. final excess mortality known many countries, historians correct figures upwards. extrapolate based numbers UK Italy, real death toll Covid definitely already half million people, maybe around three quarters million. Thank fuck reasonable people around here. went shopping last night 90% people grocery store wearing mask, PLUS whole staff still every day. Nounadjective# 2 months old. Abbott competing who's state becomes next NY. considering going outdoor patio bar, im saying fuck it.

This worked us take public masked, certainly far sensory-sensitive literally even able tolerate mask amount time. sort news generate clicks. Consequences exist outside political movements. Hopefully, widespread. Same! usually allow anyone claiming evangelist whatever want JFC America, time enter developed world. masks pussies.

Anyway, confirmed excess deaths circa 63k. Unless it’s life death situation say no. Protect people living first. 

I say person moved Australia alone 17. work live here. family country besides partner family overseas too. tough gotta gotta do. It’s like don’t technology would help lighten emotional load away family. It’s best certainly worst. Schools don’t open summer numb nuts. NYC fine wearing masks part covered concerns protests would spread virus. also big retiree population like Florida Texas widespread view US World US pandemic control. So..... fully sharpened pencil? small use keeps ending back backpack? media wants people angry cause emotion, people read news. Later on, start reporting deaths caused protests die damage already dine. way anger grow.

Our media broken I'm sure fix them. actually grow lot hate have. possibility discussed, along business license food service licenses. beer board (which charge restaurant liquor licensing) had/is emergency meeting discuss it. fun running bar liquor license, asshole (yes, really like Steve Smith, owner). assume left masks required? left required throughout gym.

Thanks clarifying. Japan take similar precautions still wear mask. Fellow Arkansan, same! Leslie Rutledge right thing change? Whoa! problem there's implication referring physically leaving gym. would better implied title said Arnold enters leaves legendary gym.

Those work companies ride minimal layoffs, furloughs outright closing, regardless mitigation suppression.

Those work companies could ride could stay open mitigation, would forced significant layoffs, outright closing, suppression. 

Those work companies afford disruption business close even mitigation only.

Of 3, second really relevant discussion.

The fact is, job losses occurred category. Theaters (movie live show), restaurants, much wedding industry-related gig economy (photographers, etc.), business profits people congregating. Sure, dangerous open - open is, usually, better closed, economically individual businesses

Plus secondary effect able pay rent/mortgage/utilities/whatever, impacts landlords utility companies, lay *their* staff. 

And sure, federal/state governments could provide assistance, (whether *should have* another matter) even funds finite anyway.

You're going people wanting stay home longer people pretend phase 2/3 freedoms irrelevant ""had freedom along"", neither really bother me, people whatever.

You sound like going wearing mask distancing it, really anything worry - end, looking yourself, really. worry much others, they'll like. Fear-mongering past racism partly blame. published data every single nursing home, see bad outbreaks were. 75% deaths county nursing homes. beyond horrific. Stop incorrect. Population density huge factor. NY Italy come mind. California state wide rent control go effect Jan 1. Buildings least 15 years old cannot raised 5% annually + inflation, 10% max. So, move right place costs much less usual right now, can't raise prices back old rate year up. actually realized SF already rent control that's capped even lower percentage, though. move apartment SF previously $4k $3.2k moment, I'd rate essentially locked small increase per year, would take several years climb back $4k. rebound, total spending remained 6.1% pre-coronavirus levels year-over-year basis.

Assuming June saw growth well, we're back previous levels retail sales. wild statement. People shifted consumption different products lockdowns well found new ways consume products normally purchased via traditional channels. Hospitality still down, airlines still down, retail strong.

Anecdotally LA NYC feel much cheaper despite technically higher prices paper. teach goddamn home again. already late. curve cut actions take now. next month already decided, far hospitalization rate goes. also ""Florida can't even blame increased testing higher numbers positive COVID-19 cases number tests administered daily peaked 10 days ago. ""  someone lived nursing home longer required hospital care sent ""home"" I've saving buy house since last fall house prices budged either According Worldometers Germany 1,797 new infections today - far highest daily increase they've since 24 April. probably linked slaughterhouse incident. People media kept encouraging protests, advising them, reason. NYC went intense lockdown minute started

No didn’t. waited weeks long even close schools restaurants.  use fema rolling morgue trailers dig mass graves. loss life appalling Diblasio (in wake complete failure US national response) waited long act. literally losing 5000 lives day. 

That exposure rate accompanied astonishing loss life. know probably inconvenient, since people recover avg like 3 weeks (too lazy search actual # roughly so), try conditioning tests past month instead all-time?

If look entire period could give hypothetical case 2 states 1 tested LOT early on, another barely any. 3 months later, testing roughly # one would probably tested 10+ times much other. Therefore say ""testing must keeping up"", accurate look recent numbers.

My point states tested less march till worse - indeed are. rather states currently worse wont grow anywhere near exponential rate NY/NJ etc.. back March original comment seemed imply. Sure! states need get this. state requirement since early April. taken good 2.5 months people finally understand properly. Finally looks right, took serious time. states dont people board fall/winter potential disaster. Good luck Fuck Abbott Trump pandering dollar focused politics. Houston getting rocked beginning many people work may habe industrues return to. people spending. Also rich people spending right now. Atleast thats keep reading. Last year (not year due covid) raised rent (Orange County, CA) almost $100, 5%. think 3% 5% increases per year pretty common. isn’t going one sized fits answer kind impact protests had. 

Some areas low number cases start protests may gotten lucky single person virus show (or did, person may spread virus much). areas may handful people infected protests, spike won’t really obvious second third rounds infection. areas (most likely ones already way spiraling control) already fucked haven’t realized yet. Wow. landlord wants mine 750 950 2 months. Says I'll OK stimulus check coming pipeline gave links places free food Philly. Ya sorry used broad brush. agree property taxes. instance based size land value home it. higher usage taxes. I’m sure could system like EBT card don’t pay taxes following year made poverty limit year could track it. Kind Tax Exempt cards work charities. 

I agree nuanced problem. I’m mainly pissed every year I’m charged vehicle drive total 30 miles week use bicycle rest time. I’m clearly anywhere close power user road system. guess still comes take out. makes infect breathing germs! /s #Ride em high cowboy  I’m Tokyo.

Prices going up. bought place tried last minute flex real estate agent due covid 19... work all.

It really depends market. go not.

Covid19 lowered interest rates lot places makes ppl want buy... overall prices homes hasn’t significantly dropped. I’ve lock downs since day one. I’m crazy masks wear work go stores that’s right get life back. really need come realization lockdowns serve delay infections cure virus. can’t lock forever think need move forward reopening. makes sense. husband (casually) looking starter home. prices seem really high area types homes. 

What’s strange, quite homes listed 20%+ purchased even less year two ago. Doesn’t seem like improvements made properties either warrant asking price increase.

My friend realtor said keep saving, might best time buy. (Semi-rural Midwest) feel too, it’s interesting horrifying feeling emotionally switch from, care people country care members “direct” tribe. assume conservative feels like time( don’t come everyone disagree, it’s true you’re changing mind.) 4995 month. deal. Wow. That’s crazy. Thanks response! Repost no. 71, sub loves articles. 'shut up, reinfection doomers' person long time, TWIV podcast folks (frontline doctors, virologists, etc) recently acknowledged happening, people demonstrably re-testing positive later, persistently testing positive months, sometimes still symptomatic appear get sick again. They've stopped saying obviously RNA fragments started using word reinfection.

The positive consensus point *seem* think they're contagious stage ... blm protests taking precautions haircut people didn't. Keep working hard maybe able afford kids one day. Lol! Darwinism. Yes, price changed 30-60 days notice.

That's entire point month month. think landlord can't change rent, need read lease closely.

The exception rent control like SF. would wrong friendly even polite him. rude law allows.

So agree, egging theater would wrong. deserve it, likely illegal Cute adding negative stereotype bullshit nice touch. Might even make idiot feel better hypocritical position. ( it). guy calling protesters ""rioting hoodrats didnduniffins breaking windows comeup"" two sides coin. probably stupid see that. 3% whatever house sells for. Looking avg home prices quarter mill, that’s fat check little work. Always comes money, thought we’ve established subreddit. Unfortunately government still recommending masks. biggest thing I'd changed. US it’s golph. change mil rate year, though, places...  That’s awesome company taking serious. think company vast majority believes can’t possibly happen them. Believe many many many people situation. mentality anywhere near majority renters would prefer absurd. Ron ""don't monkey up"" DeSantis gunna shit except try gaslight entire state say ""everything perfect, fine, testing"" Many countries Europe universal Healthcare Sweden follow totally different path. matter fact, Sweden lot health service last years. Wait, negotiate rent? Wtf. live temporarily US, tried negotiate landlord said spicily negotiating rent “is really thing”, considered “rude”. feel like idiot now.   No, [none became **seriously 

“Flu-like symptoms” motivated get tested. idea whether mildly moderately ill. 

We know weren’t hospitalized. removed Pennsylvania New Jersey continental United States, remaining states would divided two discontiguous parts. northwest corner Pennsylvania borders Lake Erie / Great Lakes, New Jersey borders Atlantic Ocean. two states recently experienced large decrease new confirmed Covid cases.

There may connection observations, they're true. work Texas Roadhouse, seat 50% least almost customers wear masks one makes them. kitchen/Front house staff wear masks view customers. I'm immunosuppressive makes nervous go work tbh. donate kidney stranger. two. greedy keep both. donate part liver too. grows back donate again. right thing. landlord applaud this, I'd much prefer work tenant happy work system engage one decides stop paying. Tired arguments deflecting real issues countries have. Gap large, less people would angry think. renewed mine. Base same, total went $10 fees. think going thorough cleaning they're properties. Luckily I'm really financially impacted anyway. work grocery store austin. lot people wearing masks. young old. people never heard free before.

Sure, that's cultural differences come in: trusting, compliant population followed teh regulations (Sweden) vs. distrusting, rebellious population poured streets protest regulations (Michigan). Sweden huge cultural advantage regard. Sweden's strategy tried US, would gone, much much worse Sweden due cultural demographic differences. Churches. Always churches.

Unless party clubs. Well, DUH !!! Yes! would see foreign students Asia masks US sick. ones. feel like I'm gaslit right now. numbers state (KS) indicate number cases percentage positive tests rising. Yet people acting like nothing wrong everything fine. local college hosting baseball games crowds. Bars downtown open large crowds people partying like normal. Vast majority people wearing masks. got invited big BBQ 70-80 people that's supposed happen two weeks. People acting like everything back normal covid something happened couple weeks ago over. Hmm, seems like guy might position something couple months ago. guess #2 tells everyone old people willing die economy worry things much. actually read fucking article? practiced social distancing months, wanted get out, thought ok, wrong. admitted wrong remorseful. take chill pill. take way quite frankly probably reflects social shortcomings. i'm talking end pandemic, current moment Arizona resident here......

He left health, news? Lol  stunned saw guy Costco last week literally pull mask look oranges! like wtf dude, hot breath produce! I’m sure pulling mask helped choose oranges, I’m sure stare expressed idiot. would even compare war virus first place? See, that’s actually useful information. really hard CNN include that?

And didn’t say testing factor. Good lack will, *not* wear mask. Florida lol . food prices volatile. 

local grocer one point sold dozen jumbo eggs close 5 dollars...but get dozen mediums buck now.

they must serious glut bacon one point, selling 2 packages 7 dollars normal price local grocer 6 dollars.

chicken seems expensive, still seeing decent prices pork. is. think implies leaving membership well. defaulted assuming pro mask, stay healthy. county Central PA started opening really anything inside past Friday. really hope community state serve example right somebody punished going outside flu well? true. vasty majority US voters cast vote HRC. US true democracy, we'd different president different coronavirus trajectory. anachronistic electoral college needs go.   dont care grandparents, pieces shit. explains whole ramp debacle actually.

Similar stories states well.
Sure testing plays role, contributing factor. People refuse wear mask 2nd worst thing wrong America people choose enable telling choices 100% valid get something 1st Yes 97% Sweden uninhabited. They'd end wearing chin, forehead, necks like already normal masks. Surprisingly...yes, totally. one could possibly predicted path set results, ever. Complete shocker. see hundreds people allowed exit early? can't find anything states this. I'm sure two since beginning this, I'm seeing hundreds anywhere.   

It really sounds like compassionate exemption terrible idea. testing two left protocol exemption problem. good way write title... definitely wondering 15 year old woman going local bar requiring masks theater. Precisely want people buy food, drinks. can't mask on. 45 wins.. may never see true numbers Thanks trumpf. Good luck proving court sarcastic? (Using global numbers) 

If true every life equal (which *agree* with), equally upset ~27 *million* people died cause mortality ~6 months covid. (Or - take step further- billions upon billions deaths human history)

Instead everyone casually *ignoring* deaths focusing ~450K covid deaths.

Further, every life equal, *survivors* lives *also* equal, casually ignoring too. Thats ~7.7995 billion.

So every life equal need actually treat such, give special place certain kind death.

This quite worrying, esp. since DK apparently world's largest mink farming industry (maybe per capita, heard friend). Hopefully taking action they've nipped problem bud, remains seen. Personally, think mink farming crap generally practice stopped time ago. possible outbreaks NL DK, happen EU.

That said, think Europe paying lip service EU this.

In Ireland, there's virtually testing done outside capital. Italy, UK Belgium - hard - lagging way behind. Germany, even less testing done.

The difference Sweden many places shut actually different. 

First all, Sweden enforce certain rules. shut bars social distancing, instance. Moreover, PEOPLE Sweden extent. 30% children taken schools. Movie theaters shut government orders, lack customers due pandemic. 

Meanwhile, places (looking you, United States), people defied orders extent patchwork laws orders. 

So far apart people like think, get similar death rates similar economic destruction.

In terms ""slow"" rate, pretty universal. spreads like spreads, slowed people distancing, wearing masks, etc. Bfe Ohio. hour major metropolitan area.

Disregarding that, already country it’s social cohesion, public trust competence (both government everyone else society), people choosing sacrifice little common, collective good. requires everyone either educated virus it’s effects stop spread, willing listen people are.

That's rude! right, n95 exhale valves protect others,

however want protect N95 properly fitted way go probability emergency vaccine trials used commit ethnic cleansing United States? would make sense policy level currently elected official medical professional’s perspective?

It doesn’t take history major critically analyze compare COVID vaccine trials Tuskegee experiment. anyone wants doesn’t know start, I’d happy give tips research analyze historical topics come conclusion degree history (yes I’m 100% serious). hell would even go this? sister works nursing home coworker tested positive. tested residents. staff tried applying test approval program denied. restaurants offer curbside pickup. safer customer employees. neighbors actually nuclear family I'm building bunker. sure made laugh. getting Covid Disney takes cake.

 story? Umm, I'm left.

Swing miss. like posts far. I’m unsure it’s necessarily hotspot kept breaking daily new case record, hospitalizations also went 11% today Since landlord owns property, they're still ones power situation.

If tennant calls bluff, worst happens landlord lost revenue. landlord calls tenants bluff, could homeless. situation improving steadily government probably expects 4/5 dead people resurrected time. would put Sweden roughly level neighbours. I'm mandatory furlough state paying state federal taxes 16 years essentially left homeless?

Probably combination really near end + sudden change environment. governor says mask required exercising, went gym hoping people would still single person did.

Except me, care think I'm weird, six month old baby boy home I'm going safe possible. theory companies realize save money smaller work spaces, allow employees work home. imagine able work anywhere - you’d probably want separate room office use (hello ergonomics) paying $$ live close work seems wasteful. They’ll move less expensive areas. still people stay live fun area don’t want give up. Sure, it’s first time concrete idea look for. Well, needed hear you, also think free different point view.

Of course, think they'll saved live it. However, treat Bible like Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book ignore anything like... ""They're protesting civil rights means they're virtue signalling"" would literally take landlord court tried charge penny unless kind major work building. Sure whatever. LOL Thanks. RemindMe! 1 year ""Is US already 407k covid deaths?"" NY also 47 deaths yesterday compared peak 1000 per day. Medford babyyyyy

The toothless stepchild oregon far least, math translated increases deaths Florida.

Here's latest graph Florida still well terms per capita deaths. currently ranked #27, 13.82 deaths per 100k. US average 34.89. (And worst-affected state NJ 142.65) Newsom get pass? There’s also fact gets sick incapacitated extended period, oligarchs make moves grab power. Yeah, it’s real puzzle.

The 'across Tennesee' make statewide statistic. numbers ***hospitalized patients***, numbers people testing positive.

People sick already overburdened system admitting putting O2, instead telling self-quarantine home.

The true Georgia, posted Tuesday show Georgia reported average 777 infections last 14 days, highest level since April, widespread transmission peak led statewide lockdown. falling, ***the number infected people hospital*** rising past 10 days, reaching 875 Tuesday.

Hospitalizations statewide increasing Georgia, too.

['From bad worse': Georgia's COVID cases, **hospitalizations** rise state argument u/DressShoeFighter . sent lots evidence infections spiking 21 days Memorial Day weekend, said hospitalizations counted. sent even links showing hospitalizations up, disappeared.

Actually twice population. depends landlord/owners. situation renting 20s 30s took one shitty owner pull constant rent increases crap realize really terrible landlords need watch for.

So landlords demand rent values sleep night? mUh tRuMpF!  website pretty awesome. I've looking something like this. Thanks. Yeah riots looting killed panic cooled, people want hope back coronavirus fear train doom. One thing note too, CA ramped testing lot, positivity rate tests actually gone 4.5% (unlike places positivity rates gone testing goes up). anyways, spread pretty steady CA, increased testing catching cases. could change soon though CA recently opened bars, hotels, casinos, etc, surge would surprising me. live Sacramento county far done well county 1.5 million people, I'm convinced remain way. good do? mean, nice he's talking masks gloves social distancing, without applying power office enforce mandate things, nothing happens. People still clog clubs beaches churches without taking precautions, leading spikes we're seeing today.

Again, I'm certainly calling lock people homes another 2 months. I'm calling actually *do* something talk.

I know expensive, can, would recommend shopping whole foods (if Costco membership). 70% customers employees wear masks whole foods. Yeah, seem think magically different time somehow, deaths eventually follow cases. 

It's kind thinking saw early stages pandemic people assumed US different somehow get us here. testing widespread like employees contact tracing gets positives may never tested otherwise. Also, prisons nursing homes ripe this. didn’t (rather know had) Covid problem nursing home deaths Seattle. Corona percolating months hit nursing home came light. Really? Source?

Except football. really ""hibernate"" summer, though? seems me, based upon Fauci described it, virus much migrate, always distributing globally, easier spread we're already huddled tiny spaces closed windows dribbly noses. least stands reason.

Though course correlation != causation impossible really tell places seeing declines actually people taking precautions distancing, wearing masks, washing skin right hands, etc, R0 might same. knows? I've never TSA agents grab crotch. must thinking so-called President. percent people polled

Most would think breathing knee pressing neck uncomfortable wearing mask.  wish Florida hospitilzation numbers available, supressed. even need specifically COVID numbers - graph showing hospitalizations year compared times last year would enough. Canadian, among many others, seen threat was. clear proper way act event. 

U.S. Citizens clearly held political agendas, money/economy, personal Stupidity welfare, neighbors welfare, future nation.

To older brother nation.

""What fuck?"" I’d expect FDA too. standing outside gyro shop waiting food passed door, another dude waiting. mask, not. could see wearing mask making uneasy, started anxiety talking me.

He says, ""what's mask going do? air everyone it?""

I told ""I think that's works"", left that.

He stood silence. CEO sick making money. 

The massive fail profit health care system explained one sentence. athiest, nice learning bible supposed translated greek hebrew roots lot gets lost english translation. makes teachings parables make sense. What's alternative?

I would suggest local governments pulling NIMBY stick backside approving housing construction, ideally dense variety, try slow growth rents something near inflationary rates. We've people die hospital young healthy. Virus care Advice? young man. Stop afraid. Dismissed ! Due dumb ass. Leaves hurt Golds bottom line harder general public thinking actually left good.  see think smarter everyone else ... covid flu = asshole.

edit: sound like Trump ""sad stuff"" ... maybe that's take cues. did. went lots detail. Even recommended wearing masks gloves maintaining social distancing (mentioned going NASCAR event Homestead servers wearing masks gloves).

He also expressly addressed lockdown idea. noted Florida deaths people 90 65 see point locking people risk virus.

If time, I'd recommend listening press conference. know reasonable person could listen come away idea ""we need lock people homes another 2 months"" correct strategy. pay 10 dollars test, everything bullshit nothing free country (USA) joke moment. Russia won. arrived. Basically acted six years old. Oh want this, can't make me! Since showing minimum amount compassion fellow human-beings make ,""sheep"". Pretty pathetic. Realistically, numbers reflective policies behaviors started 4-6 weeks ago. need waves infection spread exponentially show meaningful data curve. *multi*-generational? Thank you! Okay enclosed restaurant someone COVID 19. mask helping wear it. Yes less exposure taken eat exposing virus anyway. Part economic pressure, part idea reopen, plan, followed herd. 

Newsome (correctly) scared fucking up, don’t know know literally nothing isn’t option, try follow around you. Population density starts mattering less taking completely unrestricted, asymptomatic transfer virus changed testing setup Stockholm past week. Everyone registered Stockholm address get tested virus antibodies free. thought thing. Crises much golden opportunity politicians curse. Instead tackling problem head on, claimed hoax even though people literally losing friends family virus. Oh totally agree you. lifting travel restrictions quite bad analysis likely outcome sadly quite accurate. 

One thing *generally* irking corona responses globally one seems talking disability burden-- [Disability Adjusted Life Deaths terrible, yes, course worst outcome. sense probable IFR, I've basically never seen anyone try quantify DALY. Probably point possible so. I've read, there's increasing number Swedish people suffering longer term COVID. often able get care. think that, well deaths. I'll post bunch links below. 

But yeah, still hope works somehow, even though like suspect summer go badly. One saving grace may experts wrong disease big seasonal fluctuation (declining heavily summer). Data really show southerly regions, though, maybe *behavioral* patterns north due summer help lot. I'm sort grasping there. doubt TTI time help much summer, let's hope is. Yeah agree kind hypocritical compare country performing better. wrong per se though, long countries actually fully comparable never understood constant critic Florida states like NY. Florida 10% deaths NY 10% deaths/million NY. seem managing better older population. see uptick deaths currently, number active cases gone need handle cases seriously. wave anymore, mobious strip They've already told us expect 200K deaths August coronavirus (in US). places taking seriously, aren't. Even though many died still lot people know one died it. us flee to. sane country going accept bunch Covid-19 infected Americans? know this? differentiate someone died corona vs corona? SARS COVID19!

SARS nearly killed 25yrs old made autoimmune. dropped knees!

It hit chest like Mac truck lungs filled fluid and...i fibroid.

Fast forward 20yrs fibroids gone. (Some times fast, sometimes decade sometimes never goes away)

COVID19 similar another strain SARS. Literally.

When family sick March? last show symptoms immediate family.

My husband worst. mild saw doc chest xrays within 48hrs first symptoms.

So stayed mild. 
The fight preventing fluid building lungs.

We pneumonia PT other. Learned OG SARS survived. Australia still outbreak summer. hot Italy cases still spread.

So, basically, wrong. Heh.

I see ego let say ""yeah wrong"". Sad stuff. Need blame bar opening early too. Strenous activity doesnt cause heart problems wtf talking about? SAME! Although I’d lying said wasn’t concerned still could get re-elected.

Please GET VOTE!!  sure youre downvoted ccp reddit users unaware chinas government years? obviously shilling China call conspiracy theories. also acting like decision imprison entire cities virus somehow model rest world follow. people would rather take chances getting sick experience people Wuhan go through, that's main reason US governments forcing people quarantine 6 months. based irresponsibility, fact way slow spread human rights violation people value freedom highly enough want lock downs. Considering numbers people - including civilians - killed US army Iraq Afghanistan, likelihood dying C-19 countries far less risk dying hands US military. flu. COVID existed independently flu, point would merit. doesn't, point ignorant. don’t compare us neighbors anyone better, it’s early judge. Look Belgium/Italy there! strategy sure superior, everyone imitate us because... getting biased perspective. People genuinely concerned others less representative public isolating. People genuinely care likely thus see more.

Virus doesn’t care sort thing. Im curious, abouts from? I'm North England every morning leave house every evening return. Sorry America world. lots older people Arizona well, love dry heat! live Orlando even went protest (drove/saw multiple them), lucky see even half people masked. 

Absolutely social distancing obviously. Acting like everyone protested perfect insane. Go look protests youtube see yourself.  mean, already knew case since spread like crazy plenty countries like Iran Brazil despite warm temperatures time. Record number cases far... ""It important note Pastor Bakker never said silver solution prevented cured COVID-19. Silver solution similar supplements also commonly sold Walmart, GNC, CVS Amazon, without legal action Arkansas Attorney General.” 

That, right there, case going end. Attorneys General cannot pick choose fraudsters prosecute. prosecution must include *all* similar fraud within state borders.

This going go well court Attorney General. North America. don’t think see another lockdown here. joke say would attend riots Right, bodybuilders whole cut bulk cycle stupid dangerous done improperly (read: steroids.)

I've got friend natural bodybuilder, pattern gain 30 lbs October late Feb (3-4 months bulk) cut least 20 lbs next 8-9 months. (The cutting usually happens lot quicker that, maintains duration.) come holidays he's allowed feast..... also spends ridiculous amount time gym year round. pointless waste money, thing nonetheless. guys get hammered like Philly even suggestion IFR close 1%

I genuinely can't believe arguing June. seen recent R0 number estimates per state, seems least states climbed somewhat 1.

I dug methodology all, [rt.live](http://rt.live) good resource this. assume true. also true folks passed away covid books?

Sure near many. Think hundred people sniffles, many seek treatment? hundred people experiencing severe difficulty breathing due pneumonia, many doe think avoid treatment?

Please also consider following:

\- people sniffles strong incentive seek treatment test positive corona locked two weeks everyone contact with, never mind social stigma. 

\- people pneumonia strong incentive seek treatment experiencing pain likely die without treatment

\- Even people pneumonia die alone homes bodies found, often within weeks likelihood tested Coronavirus. I’m sorry you’re scared world reason. actually many recorded cases latter. I'm almost feeling like U.S big dumb ever get page anything ever again. avoid pissing core demographic idiots believe conspiracies? People said would lower rate transmission protests, people masked, social gatherings going since Memorial Day, people unmasked, spikes originally reported states opened early protests, don’t recall anyone saying would “no transmission” protests. can't believe schools going bring students back fall helping. never said helping. laugh. important laugh crisis. thought subreddit covid updates, celebrities doung make laugh bro. world complicated. 

Seriously, understand words guideline, like ""AND"" may cause deviations interpretation. provide report show actually practice. two cases translated finally defined asymptomatic counted 36 confirmed cases. result proved opinion. hope find proofs detailed enough too.

The reason believe report interpret ""guideline"" way, even simple. based **personal experience**. 

 took flight Bangkok Shanghai March quarantined 14 days. quarantine centralized specific hotel. 14-day quarantine, despite criteria guideline, **everyone treated suspected case**. PCR tests blood tests taken day 1 day 13. PCR positive, sent specific fever clinic, tests like CT scan antibody tests determine whether confirmed case. 

See? processes nothing symptoms! symptoms still experienced life suspected case 14 days. Whether ""asymptomatic"" decided sent fever clinic. believe cases Beijing traced confirmed procedure mine. me, confirmed cases confirmed, suspected cases quarantine, waiting tests. simple.

I don\`t know countries treat suspected cases, make comments China does. guess ""free press"" cover details quarantine policy China misunderstanding sprout. mean, ludicrous see someone making weird comments, denying personal experience using bunch political conspiracy theories imagination. really, really ludicrous. That’s odd Lol I'll take mask split second breathe take drink water. complain, fuck em, especially wearing mask themselves. even 1 100. would 1%.

Its 0.09% 1 1000. whole population 0-69yrs old. know virus, younger better chances likely number go even lower this.

Also question infected, thats gonna happen everyone. heck yeah, lower numbers even more. Texas. executive order Arizona’s governor prevented mayors anything. Moron Chief sets bad example country morons follow suit. Empowered spoiled overaged children. new cold vaccine still quite know best treat. case common respiratory infections can’t explain it’s major discomfort? Lol

Im dick expecting leeches contribute society. ‘’People prefer wear mask” isn’t real thing, you’re part sort social movement lmao. 

Not self centred expect adults act like adults, clearly struggle with. 

How ‘major discomfort’ ‘huge inconvenience’ you? expand that, you’re making excuses lol. 

During pandemic? Yeah no, don’t get spread disease cry people think you’re dick. Plus way easier 4 million people island. Iceland even managed death rate .05% 300k people deal with. didn't. myth routinely debunked every time comes up. Taiwan evidence anything would announced world. anything SEA countries time.  Death pretty permanent know sure mutated, think probably did. rest wrong influenza pandemics since time, indeed almost cases influenza worldwide (excepting human infections avian viruses H5N1 H7N7), caused descendants 1918 virus, including ""drifted"" H1N1 viruses reassorted H2N2 H3N2 viruses. latter composed key genes 1918 virus, updated subsequently incorporated avian influenza genes code novel surface proteins, making 1918 virus indeed ""mother"" pandemics.

It never went away. Calm down, report posted (if bothered read) Defense Threat Reduction Agency United States, DOD (Department Defense / US Defense Department). Ok, column E spreadsheet shows 7 day death average. appears trending late May high. could number reasons likely combination as:

1. Deaths always lag spikes we'd see increase deaths coming days weeks.

2. Improved treatment protocols.

3. younger people getting sick old. part due better processes care homes.

I'm sure potential variables immediately come mind. tests pay sold private companies.

Never hears surgeons nurses bitching wearing masks 8-12 hours time. 

Firefighters: ""im going building!"" 
... ""why?""
""Because wear respirator hard breathe ): ): "" Gyms never allowed open vaccine. gyms, even mask protect you, Don’t try reason majority people subreddit. worship virus Indeed. think reality ongoing outbreaks extend time need wear masks start school.

then bets off. Remember, say 'I responsible anything' mean fucking responsible everything. like Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy. DeSantis, Abbott, Kemp, Trump, still fucking responsible matter lame excuses are. fear mongering. real. talking doctors case covid lung damage learned many damage virus body, especially lungs kidneys, severe likely never fully go away. 

In case likely never recover full function lungs. Looking damage virus CT scan, even weeks later, shows extensive scarring baseline oxygen level reflects it. 

There things right afraid of. Oh gtfo write elegantly great story! Well. Everyone healthcare experience knows masks (and gloves gowns) effective, they've standard equipment professionals nearly century, worldwide. 

For come spew obvious lies garbage like lit red lights alarm bells throughout world, public health policy circles, private healthcare. 

It's akin making statement like ""seatbelts save lives, cigarette smoking cause cancer."" clarify, masks enforced don’t wear correctly talk without one. got virus back April exact symptoms. Never got sick, cold week. Hoping best you! right there's debate around asymptomatics ability spread virus still treating risk. means someone coughing mean treat healthy.

O.O

Wtf? depends Maryland.

Baltimore City reopened. 11,000/1,000,000 tested positive. 

that 1 percent population CONFIRMED case. Yeah don’t sit beach day. go tiki bar get surf turf dinner **PUBLIC HEALTH WARNING**

People mislead thinking ""mild"" virus everyone really dangerous. Think again:

1) virus widespread like media speculated, India Japan showing less 1% 0.1% infected, respectively. - [Source [Source [Source Older antibody tests, used inflate infected numbers lower IFR, dont work. 15% known cases UK, European countries, dead. Brazil Florida hide numbers bad. 0.25% NYC already dead, containment measures. 0.25%. *entire* city. Pop 8 million. Ryan, Ryan said Monday concerned talk tests future show people infected world could return normal. **Clinical studies actually shown opposite**, insisted. told briefing Monday worried “this narrative, assumption disease spread around, really seeing severe cases difficult cases”.  Always churches slaughterhouses. Sorry make disappointed treatment won’t anything global scale corona. effective worst cases still require weeks ventilator. Sure, lives saved need get infected want medicine help. Contraproductive. move Canada, particularly work requires buy house eventually apply citizenship. going plan. obvious veg aisle Tesco, free all. He's legend. Take everything. Probably October November.  means take 164 weeks, 3 years 2 months

And think what? disease *won't* hang around long? world reach herd immunity then? thing going anywhere 3 years long time mutating virus.

Perspective: Chickenpox vaccine (not sars-covid virus, mucho mucho less *deadly*) isolated forward **TWENTY FIVE YEARS** 1995 first vaccine chickenpox. right, can't say anything know since outcome hindsight. Trends say much, need know what's behind (like criteria amount testing). admit I'm somewhat biased FHM spokesperson really instilled confidence constant shifting positions never admitting fault doubt methods. fiasco tests one many gaffs given doubts handling, go paragraphs. Thanks info. Exactly. people listen him. Even lied everyone else, himself, almost moral duty least tell truth supporters literally believe everything said definitely gonna pay price mind wearing mask would make look weak. yesterday. Another 2600 today. 10% total positive cases happened last 3 days. Oh, know. far aware, biological process identified us uses silver. Nobody can, need extended family work.

We need start valuing unpaid labor start. There's lot shame status lost taking care people dependency position think many AirBnBs, honestly. L.A., median \*household\* income around $60,000 average rent $2500. Yes. know average median different cant find median rent L.A. give shit people dying every day Covid? course sympathetic, it’s like prior Covid mourning every single unfair untimely death. Humans don’t energy offer “that’s sad” deaths never know. Mostly LA Fucking insane still elective surgeries. Insane. let us cope surge, could turn hospital 75% covid heart attacks stuff rest. Manhattan, NYC. Take walk hood part Bronx rent. I'm going evicted along wife 3 kids paying half rent last 3 months. I. Am. Fucked. actual numbers provided? miss them? Practically speaking though... virus ""going dormant"" months coming back incredibly ominous. know 100% certainty wont happen people? you’d looked Sympathy card section stores NYC - shelves bare. That’s happens 30,000 people die 3 months. call bullshit this.

if attorney general wrote letter Dallas County ( pop. 2.3 million people) asking cease desist plan technical basis wanted come own...*freaking pick phone talk them*. pussies wear masks. 😂 reason shouldnt significant lockdowns. k rate low That’s happens all.

Doctors clue insurance have, ICU’s full “mass casualty” protocols inplace people best chance recovery given priority. really question people continue live cities expensive. pay $750 month share rent, I'd freak out. Living city rent prices affordable opens world much. live pretty nice lifestyle making 35k year. start making 55k  year rounding credentials, I'm going really start accruing wealth. There's merit moving big city first job college get bag, point people need move smaller towns. Cutting rent expense frees finances like nothing else. PLEASE LET HAPPEN IM 23 WANT MOVE thats wear mask... kind stupid strawman comparison this?

It’s like saying 1000 people die home invasions every year COVID killing 100x let’s lock doors anymore. What?? I've wondering this. Especially rent retail spaces. businesses close, landlords rent to? mean, might NEED UBI right now, i'm genuinely curious, what's solution increasing amount jobless workers due automation coming decades? people get replaced machines going enough jobs go around. Many people change fields, possibly becoming service technicians robots themselves. likely always need trade jobs; plumbers, electricians, like. enough everyone. mass unemployment. Workers already compensated well enough work bottom end, minimum wage employees areas needing work 40 hours week cover (meager) expenses. sure, make supply/demand argument that, fact workers lower rungs company generate wealth top.

UBI meant provide lavish lifestyle, meant cover basic necessities like food/shelter. UBI systems, qualified trained able work well afford luxuries. that, whether someone ""earned"" it, what's solution impending problem automation? See, makes glad live state masks required. want enter business? Mask up. Nobody cares think virus- shoes, shirt, *no mask*- service. think pandemic might result WFH employees globally. span overall rating plane fullness, well rules followed, etc

United - B-

American - B

Allegiant- A

Sun Country - A- Affordable homes available everywhere. live city affordable homes here. incorrect.

Your advice ridiculous. feel like people terrible negotiations. I’ve people try “negotiate” usually terrible offers:

“I want apartment $95 less per month want 10 months lease” 

...okay whatcha gonna do? There’s 4 people applications right now, there’s incentive go less rent non standard time? ...since Joe Weider Died. winds shit must blowing That's keep coming back best explanation places struggling sustained drops, too. looks like there's threshold (and much lower think herd immunity) point infection rate drops drastically. Ok, well bad taste aside - since seem stop - legalities - since also stop - could encourage behaviour commissioning mass production provision masks public, claim kind patriotic credit time. Trump mask presidential seal it, he's taken stance strength = mask chance communicate strength = mask. would interested see state data comparing increase/decrease cases based strict shutdowns were, compare states governors R see 50-60%? highest number I've seen 20% NYC hardest hit part US. like Pro-Virus. read right?

""A delayed Public Health England review reasons BAME people disproportionately affected [pointed historical review role diet vitamin D.""

Has someone actually tried tie death rate covid19 historical racism? Could anyone possibly take seriously? virus, someone actually think racism linked cahoots? Could mean covid19 released kill darker skin(this joke totally unthinkable).

I'm stunned PHE even put public domain. Ah, you’re probably good go! Honestly secret love plants like pets make sure you’re everything give good lives. Seeds tedious they’re babies! problem. hope degree gender studies serves well. won’t hits home him. word selfish doesn’t even begin cover actions. exacerbated symptoms! Thanks morning laugh! Working conditions. several workers working close quarters, sharing equipment, circulation slaughtered livestock different parts  slaughterhouse hands different workers, perfect place outbreak. California actually increase testing. Look positivity hospitalization rates. Can't shutdown. Trump mad him. people came contact church? USA opening back (too quickly areas) support economy COVID free.

Right, always plan. never going free COVID-19. original comment unclear think following original plan bad rather stay locked forever. Oregon sub praising kind behavior? Oregon redditors love nothing sh*t churches covidiots. think herd immunity. need upwards 70% infected recovered order build herd immunity. Maine that's 900,000 people ~9,000 dead.

You're **2,800 cases now**. Even NYC, worst hit, ""only"" 400k cases. Remember second wave Spanish Flu devastating even though many people got first wave. Herd immunity something try get. wife half-joking friends south, us getting divorce, remarrying others could move here. going happen, getting less less ""joking"".

Also; ""favour"". got start somewhere. :-) fault. must blame ~~immigrants~~ young people! Show **one** Randomized Control Trial study verified outcome shows benefit health care workers community members households wearing mask respirator.

'If stop testing right now, we'd cases, any' People lock down, first hit US It’s frustrating gives perception entire United States hellscape right now, know that’s true all. headlines “cases spiking US” gives false perception reality situation. 

It speaks fact sub completely ignores good news whatever reason, people don’t seem want things get better. feel horrible states going spikes, doesn’t mean ignore many states much better.

Good news good reason. help people realize there’s light end tunnel. Yes, cost minimising sacrifice people wars made New York testing record amounts every day getting less positive cases March? consider cases infections weeks decent job?

No, write that. Zealand may done decent job keeping infection rates lower compared countries

Which something completely different. Lol! might want indoctrinate yourself
Into statistics class actually believe 119K deaths 300 million people worth killing jobs/economy top damage fed/govt last 70 years currency inflation...

Here’s hint you’d notice adequate statistics clearly aren’t... Less .05% people US died this, less 1 every 2000 people... Almost certainly not. Also aren’t asking people went protests testing.

My concern bottleneck capacity - people working labs didn’t work days curfews riots whatever would create large backlog would take time work through. New York says kept test processing throughout riots might believe (because went thru) Minnesota? don’t think level organization, they? Ohio:

We never hit hard. opened retail stores month ago, bars almost four weeks ago. time hospitalizations slightly downwards trend. Cases deaths stable slightly downwards well.

Mask usage continues decrease well. truth logical explanation fits 100%. closest guess able come time spent outside. south people inclined spend time inside right due heat. Right live everyone spending much time outside possible. Scenes pictures protests emerge...

I’m scared anyone else fortunate position plan much possible exactly do. Even suffers, change position. already knows better. 1000% image pandering ignorance constituents. I'm sarcastic. means Americans eager get everyone sick. woke turned American news looks like warnings right. would Americans take guns rally demanding go work clear everyone going sick? blm protest end result black people get sick die. easy tell declining States ppe etc live Arizona... hardly anybody wearing masks. staying home. Please share happens fingers 🤞 you. Try stay home get results - safe side - don’t want viral exposure - adds up. gladly pay extra taxes high quality “Trump 2020” masks given free all.

It’s ultimate way libs like myself, use tax dollars pay Trumps ad campaign keep ton Trump voters alive.

What get it?

I mean less fellow Americans dying, clearly that’s enough.

My wife gets super bummed people die hospital, that’s fun.
