0,2020-11-21," similarly outraged 7000 B737s worth people died TB last year, virus vaccine? fair, Japan Taiwan. Changes way life 9/11: tighter security airports, allow government spy us previously. Changes due Covid-19: almost every aspect daily lives affected, huge economic impact still unfolding. think current situation temporary, depends think ""normal"" like couple years now. Lol. 

Western countries really handling pandemic well ways... Honestly, it‚Äôs hard tell internet days Match 13th last day school kids michigan many us go back office day. Unless you‚Äôre AutoModerator you‚Äôre following thread correctly. logic UK would COVID free also elected incompetent government work out. Canada/France works marginally better US, suffer still forms similar problems. miss yellow shirt protests? middle class countries phased out. Living standards generation parents.

Singapore's governance always considered second none world stage. real income middle class grown decade upon decade, 90% people houses, dealt efficiently COVID less 40 death population 4 million. life expectancy ranks one world's highest, two universities World Top 50 (despite country 4 million!), healthcare ranks among best world crime rate one lowest.

But fine... stay drinking corporate media pits middle class vs poor politicians sell country corporate masters.  Breathing heavily deeply enclosed room many randos thing - could possibly go wrong?

Paging Mr. Darwin!.... paging Mr. Darwin! Hello? Actually probably trying fast track hearing like impeachment hearing protect trump office. believe worried covid shenanigans tax fraud  What!? Ever heard Edward Snowden know lives Russia now? arbitrary time period, would think lot would known year one day one. least know we're free?..../s sit back let us That's thing. one guy. must talking point somewhere.

These people say Covid-19 *exist*. big brain time state closed borders infected states, kept us clean 7 months. Europe can't this. think probably depends densely populated area is, saturated virus is. place like NYC earlier year, made sense mandate mask-wearing outdoors. 

Here midwest, never wore mask outdoors summer, town saturated covid, do. nbd wear mask. uncomfortable wear bra mask. potential infect others myself, makes lot sense it. Sorry people downvoting you. gave upvote. saw news report O‚ÄôHare packed Friday. People visiting family going vacations. can‚Äôt believe selfish people are. tell .65% month, bud. Triple H, knew it! Nope. It‚Äôll remembered China virus ""We really can't escape effects virus"" says Dallas Fed Economist.

Truer words never spoken. Lockdowns, lockdowns, path irrelevant: virus cause economy collapse unless cases get control outbreaks effectively managed. Shut Airlines Trains. Simple. live isolation life bud Bad fair assessment yep. Autonomous Ultra Fuckedstinct Careful, gotta step around boner reddit public transportation Wow, asking, need rude making sense here, ok. particular website check every day tracks numbers helpful graph, last month infected numbers skyrocketed last days death number followed suit. fact death graph looks exactly like two week period immediately New York City reached 4000 deaths day.

Except time it‚Äôs going happen New York City, it‚Äôs going happen country, once. 

All next week Americans going go everywhere Thanksgiving make 100 times worse. People understand massive scale disaster going hit. point cannot see way avoid nationwide Katrina.

We could taken steps, could taking steps right now, instead we‚Äôre opposite. It‚Äôs like, hitting iceberg, titanic turned around rammed full speed spite. 

All events next months someone‚Äôs history test decades, probably even centuries now. case legitimately confused, vaccine effective percentiles hearing would effectively provide herd immunity, killing injuring Less People (by Lot). seriousness, feel adding risk someone else's job? weird order protect level feel necessary, forcing work.

I think hypocritical wrong per se, weird thing me, holding home people work low wages bring stuff. highest estimates 10% US population contracted Covid. least 70% needed benefits herd immunity. still years, millions deaths away number. look believe governments matter rules game encourage behaviour 'capitalist' countries good job well. goes much deep aspects culture. posted they‚Äôre anti-Chinese propaganda arm, response say it‚Äôs bullshit evidenced fact ‚Äúthey written plenty anti china anti ccp articles‚Äù?

What? Already flattening out. We‚Äôve hit peak. link BNO‚Äôs reinfection includes **genomically-confirmed** reinfections (a high bar evidence), shows total 26 far. bottom page (in timeline section) lists many hundreds *suspected* reinfections currently investigation. Idiots Well hit million cases, 12,000 day people dumb fuck. Probably worst metric wise it‚Äôs BAD get test soon next day Indy. I've done times. ISDH website. need revisit later trumps longer president senate run Paywall California needs secede man, sick dumb fascists. Excellent advice  It‚Äôs reopening problem with. places really open safely. anti-mask people US bad anyone. believe government created virus control people making wear mask. Equally importantly, Chinese government one ignored it. important distinction, evidence cover-up really based actions local officials, central government became aware, shit got clamped down, hard fast. Shudder. infected leaning towards younger groups, reasonable assume US currently something like 500k infections day. vaccines prove curbing spread applied scale months, find reasonable assume 1 3 US citizens Covid-19 point. eligible, sadly - thank you! everyone, no. there‚Äôs tons people positive/presymptomatic/asymptomatic walking around infecting others. even portion knew contagious stayed home, would help. Still, using representation, U.S. COVID deaths equivalent 1,250 planes crashing 10 months since ~February - due cause didn‚Äôt exist last year. state test atomic bombs in? think really understanding, problem enough born one countries social safety net.

*Most* developed countries social safety net. Seriously, USA complete anomaly. needs created government care people. That's rest us looking cock-eyed using quotation marks around ""needs."" make sense us.

Lots people know furloughed, destitute end needing medical care. still scary, people downsizing without income can't afford huge homes, good gracious, eat healthy without working, that's government do. trying times, phrase ""grim milestone"" become new normal, we're together opposed Trumpsters made supporting specific candidate entire personality 4 years, almost like *cult personality*?

God guys actual, non-ironic NPCs. Well said. Offensive hard hearing people. like people won‚Äôt wear clear mask help deaf hard hearing people understand speech. guess people don‚Äôt care doesn‚Äôt affect /r/boottoobig Fauci closest thing ‚Äúscientist warning apocalypse one pays attention him‚Äù beginning apocalypse movie. 

This guy deserves motherfucking shrine end this. don‚Äôt know one man much endurance much stupidity. Thank Fauci never giving informing public, one public figures humble enough answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù hope understands rational people understand beyond gone us. :( Meanwhile million plus passengers going traveling Thanksgiving got test says 100% safe üôÉü•¥ No... got forced return people (German here) Let's say, sake argument, correct, CCP covered pandemic beginning. Conceding that, world governments known covid since December 2019, know contagious since early February. supposed CCP cover-up cause current situation US? you‚Äôre eligible donate blood Red Cross free. Fuck Mitch McConnell.  Damn, felt good say. normally little taste smell. Whenever can‚Äôt tell milk going bad, like normally do, worry covid. feel fine. hope she‚Äôs okay WTF lottery maybe nothing time science actually functioning government help people it. 

We Americas know government doesn‚Äôt capability pull feat. 

So instead ‚Äúharsh‚Äù eight week lock supplies needed, cluster fuck. Yeah right. Always asshole scientist stopping things. pass, merrier, world crowded, easily lose 1-5b people okay. would almost say 6-8b liberally, lot emotions right now. moment allow type movement, virus spreads. can't lock everyone homes, there's unfortunately way fully stop spread.  real January, likely. guess one selfish lockdown skeptics can't math think going dead Christmas. absolutely nuts article suggests 5 million travelled overseas, incorrect. first couple cases Australia come China earliest cases, came Europe. I'm damn frustrated. can't visit family meal Thanksgiving, Wife could go eat restaurant around strangers?  


Wife can't go grocery store \_together\_ get large trips done cut amount times need go month family 5 heightens risk exposure others, hundreds thousands people year streets signs cities country seemingly worry.  
Couldn't take kids Trick Treating year Disneyland open. 

Neighbors sick year staying home. either side us. sick since March. 3 families got together since can't visit families Thanksgiving? Wear masks inside social distance? Possibly face fines? 

I already expect Cancel Christmas New Year's also tell us even though get Vaccines (when available) STILL can't go out.  
I'm probably going hit mental breaking point then.  
I mean, VA appointments cancelled year. annual physical new Doctor, mental health checks, meds, therapy. rough.  
But hey, started open gyms movie theaters.... Well hope wrong friend correct? found portal web page, web portal speak. Michigan trying pause see least somewhat mitigate Thanksgiving. Hoping partial shutdown last three weeks.

We'll need shutdown till next year least.. Christmas better, holiday season catastrophe. definition low risk gathering may different... see average thanksgiving day gathering high risk.

- Family members unlikely wear masks distance

- Family elders likely present, high risk

- Children likely present, high probability asymptomatic carriers, especially attend in-person schooling. Contact children likely especially close -- little buggers stay off, lol.

- Duration likely prolonged; several hours least cases

- False sense security due testing probably questionable measures

I hope I'm wrong, expect spike cases 1st/2nd week Dec. definitely something hope I'm full shit about, but.. decision severe lock Adelaide based people lying contract tracers. embarrassed government little makes worried lock downs future Adelaide needs them. predictable. preventable. point, equivalent cigarette companies arguing causal link smoking lung cancer. used think *modestly* intelligent 50% population....after election COVID know I‚Äôm easily, EASILY smarter 80% Americans.

Shit...makes feel good man. know work acquaintances traveling like nothing wrong. 

They cite United put CDC study airplane one safest indoor places measurements. Even it‚Äôs true. 

I know two Medellin Colombia right tourism. 
To some, it‚Äôs like doesn‚Äôt exist it‚Äôs life normal borders open. Apparently question survey extremely poorly worded. basically asked going go events less 10 people, combined group going event 10 people along people staying home single statistic.  Standard: ""False Negative"". Fuck. I'm hungry right now. Send hel- sorry, think journalists write articles genuinely retarded really feel population. government horrifies me: anti Jewish, anti lgbt, anti freedom. virus government doesn‚Äôt put funding testing anything. really screwed Tonight, first time since started, entered (unknowingly) business board masks. blown away. Signs place, inside out; ""No Mask? ask!?"", ""Mask not, decision!"". Nice sign register saying cleared County Health Dept./We exempt state regs.

The 2 workers, masks (owner wife). Father son come (maybe 12 yo), masks. 

This small local pizza shop. fuck, people? fuck. sense cohesion US. Long term effects poor education system. serious question? Traveling extremely risky.  IHME never right once, projected 25 deaths state 3,000 deaths. shocking President ducks G20 pandemic meeting go play golf.  immune, express symptoms. People carry viruses show symptoms, word asymptomatic carrier. people still get others sick regardless health.

So yeah, going universe judge negligently homicidal idiot. soul worth that. Lol.  God, saying sub beginning. huge numbers people asymptomatic, studies followed shown carriers presymptomatic. Planning wearing full biohazard suit , take it? What's frustrating many liars reddit claim same. right, except ‚Äúdoes work‚Äù answered now. works. You‚Äôre paranoid, live someone caught way. max hangs air 3 hours controlled environment. windows air place time. small condo chill room door shut AC prevent AC spread 3 hours following outsiders, hang porch. run ac fan normal mop floor were. People thinking cloth masks enough doesn‚Äôt help either problem attitudes like work don‚Äôt, time discover truth, it‚Äôs late. logic goes: since got away before, must always ok. It‚Äôs psychological fallacy, trick mind plays you. It‚Äôs behind many major even everyday disasters. It‚Äôs related boiling frog story.

For example, big explosion Beirut August. stored explosives years without anything bad happening, one day, Boom! hindsight, it‚Äôs obvious bad idea, heck, even it‚Äôs happening it‚Äôs bad idea. people say whatever man, hasn‚Äôt happened yet, must ok. Sometimes you‚Äôll never get second chance. 2020-03-16

\*sigh\* SVD article 15:th simply said current approach working, clearly not.

You‚Äôre implying things go back normal live consequences it‚Äôs grandma who‚Äôs going die. words.

Your logic fucking horrendous. IHME? Really?

Y‚Äôall gonna fall again? going Warp speed! Thought would years Normal could possibility. I've learned average intelligence scary. believe internet gave stupid people reason get involved politics...I'm waiting lesson learn from...it's coming one learning shit millionaire closer homeless billionaire.

To become homeless, millionaire merely needs lose 90% wealth.

But become billionaire millionaire must increase wealth 100000%.

I understand people can't see basic math works think they're closer Bezos homeless. it‚Äôs easy don‚Äôt position. situation requires people stay home help stop spread, least increase spread. Left Wuhan where?

If stay less 6 ft apart it‚Äôs less 10 people germ group don‚Äôt see problem.

Those 5 million could‚Äôve went US Europe anywhere else China wasn‚Äôt infected. 

So what‚Äôs point? didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm immune. I‚Äôm fine. please worries. 

It‚Äôs pretty great.

Also. old people, according Reddit, fucked planet...now care them? Executive orders complicated implying. Otherwise single individual could overthrow entire government executive orders. close effective treatment COVID-19? I'm reading great news vaccines prevent virus treatment? treatment compared vaccines? going take longer vaccines? already shown safe large Phase 3 trial; that‚Äôs data they‚Äôre reviewing. can‚Äôt fault optimism. Glad able get full refund.  article really say, fewer people spread virus... right? It‚Äôs education problem US. People learn read math fine. problem social media propaganda. right wing started decades ago radio, Fox News, social media. part starting spread throughout world. Brazil got taste Bolsonaro. Europe seeing rise populism groups often similarly right wing. guess technically could say it‚Äôs education problem identifying propaganda learning trust internet sources aren‚Äôt taught everyone, really are. People write papers high school learn source quality various classes. It‚Äôs end day people like hearing want hear. country well enough basic needs met, luxury voting conspiracy theories. education system isn‚Äôt failing America. F) Results need 24-48 turnaround time (but ideally less 24 hours) essential workers need compensated prevents going work. Regardless PTO, any.


G) Testing free without needing dispute surprise copay (uncooperative) insurance company.


H) two conditions apply even person keeps testing ‚Äòfalse alarms‚Äô because.  Sorry, playing Russian Roulette old people built nation you. I'm willing responsible someone's grandma's death, justice universe's court stars, depravity gross disregard human life would end eternity among supernovas. might say fuckiest Unfortunately did. site bunch insane right wing bullshit. Wake up. lol whoops forgot ‚Äúrally‚Äù. nothing motorcycles.  prefer Monday mornings. way right behind ‚Äúafter church‚Äù crowd Sunday. I'm looking Oregon daily deaths fairly regularly. seem 70+ often 80s. data state's age demographic breakdown? I'm curious skews older. stores 2 reasons:

1) know hoarding unnecessary 

2) stock, people shop clearly control feelings experiencing great deal rage. great day! Again, wish nothing best. thing year, sucks people don‚Äôt live west coast though Election's over, covid hoax

/s ""No purely political comments""

""Magafucked cool though."" Lmao automatic renewal lease perfectly legal. renter sucks ""Degeneracy""

Yeah? Like what, maybe he'll cheat pregnant wife porn star? kind degeneracy? research came ""The Italian Association Cancer Research"" China nothing study. countries, even Asia, good job. countries good job Vietnam, Taiwan Thailand.

I call China's handling success. Even Singapore Hong Kong mediocre best. South Korea struggling

And Japan handling biggest mystery. test less people many developing countries. clubs open Georgia im surprised long term...wouldn‚Äôt better patients too? Positive tests high Ct values usually reflective stage infection rather infectious someone is. example, expect high Ct values someone recently recovered disease.

Asymptomatic individuals extremely infectious. ability COVID silently spread makes dangerous. Selfish. even bother Thanksgiving. big deal. suck seeing family? Sure get it. Oregon two weeks paid sick leave. 9 states. getting slowly. don‚Äôt even think all, bud. Glad live rent free head though! Enjoy obsessing griping country don‚Äôt even live :) Why? mean English mother tongue hear quite often Whaaat? works great china. make sure post anti-trump rhetoric social media lose 30 points! Jfc think that, right actual fuck wrong people. sister annoyed want see niece. Niece coastguard, stationed CA, husband still living Seattle. flew (to east coast) last week. Yeah, no, want see them. I'm fucking high risk know, 75 year old father also lives me. Hey. knock it. $20... spending probably $100... win... Oh noooesss we're going die!!!! work! lazy rest life! go things love doing! stay inside stay depressed big scary virus going get yooouuu!! always hope best. Booked 6 months ago hoping things exploding like today. fine, got full refund hope best Christmas. (yes know looking great right now) catch STD? advocating spread disease? New births per day greatly numbers COVID deaths. going put dent population all. everyone homes minority may compromised? Learn support opinions facts reasons, otherwise look like fucking idiot. Better luck next time. would people canceled still counted? go hospital get one vaccine proved 90% effective must stored -80 degC - hope go vaccine need distributed like flu shots, pharmacy, vans like portable blood donation vans, even mailbox. Even then, insurance expensive majority healthy people never go down, vaccines need cheaper meal McDonalds. keep saying Americans dumbest people is. Hate country   Ironic given immigration rates countries *into* US magnitudes larger US citizens immigrating *into* countries.  Willful ignorance hell drug okay Americans it.
Freedom that, know. Murican way. mean, bought 21 lb. Butterball Safeway $20. I've struggled understand thing. Yes, sucks, emotionally hard, temporary. grand scheme life, nothing. mention staying home getting numbers would actually benefit economy, damage like everyone seems think. Keeping things open numbers high making everything worse. BS Wynn Dixie Florida Keys!! everyone's interest learn came from, tbf. people want live life. tough convince people put entire life hold 9 months see family. sucks lead spread easy completely isolate oneself  nationalistic conservative tendencies (at least compared comparably developed Europe), weaker labour rights EU members affiliates, significant territorial disputes neighbours. Wow, tough dude. Good luck. sub honestly pisses doom gloom blaming people. quarantined like 9 months done little nothing. Wore masks everywhere I‚Äôve gone. I‚Äôve done everything right prevent spread.

But fuck god damn terrible decide see family first time year. Fuck reddit sometimes, man. watch international news, people every country behave less responsible way. excuse Virus care. like drunk driver kill's family. hindsight made poor decision, late now. kind shows stupid people are. seem understand, need 15 min test 100% accurate testing go event matters. white house understand either, maybe much masses get. problem still need people care patients. Nurses generally would love better work style, patients come first none us want put patients risk strike. Yeah, that's thought crossed mind. mean, get lockdowns effective, US also human rights building codes, ""just weld shut doors"" violates those. get gets results, it'd still super unconstitutional US. Stay safe! first wave NYC. US. That's difference. Fucked\^3 Well wearing mask skipping hollidays oppression can‚Äôt even talk you. sucks. bag tax Anchorage waved also let use reusable bags bagging. want vaccinate 70% population saying want talking 252 days.

This sadly realistic number. People saying everyone get spring summer normal kidding themselves. Even people make vaccines saying it'll ~8 months till hit 70%. means cases continue rise relatively next 8 months (relatively appears seasonal factor) haven‚Äôt shut since initial shutdown back like March Let's honest. Many, probably most, people completely self-isolating 9 months. Plenty people going bars, restaurants attending private gatherings since late spring/early summer lockdown ended. would guess people traveling attending large medium-sized Thanksgiving gatherings already seeing families months. we're middle one biggest surges we've far many states seeing record-breaking infection rates. *not* time traveling partying. One year without Thanksgiving Christmas parties going kill anyone. Actually, opposite -- traveling parties definitely wind killing people. would imagine yes. even Sooners fan, lol. people rushing towards tornado get closer look, acting surprised get swept away... would expect someone paid spread disinformation post every day. literally job. lol right ""covet"" right vote remove peoples' voice take away right express opinion form vote invite nothing violence revolution

Violence revolution happens people discontent.  People content without right vote. 

Not opinions equal, economist expert medical subjects voting medical policies.  haven‚Äôt shut since real shutdown back like March Washington State. FDA nod 
Such bad ""journalism"" I‚Äôve twice already.... lol

I know people claim they‚Äôd 3 times well... ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm hoping MSNBC CNN changed ads. Fox shuttered... disagree? you‚Äôve conducted studies data support disagreement, means, show us them. disagreement merely uninformed opinion without evidence, rejected without evidence.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty obvious . . . doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù. Please provide sources support statement. it‚Äôs obvious, easy understand. enlighten us. 2 made more. cases shipped counties, enough room staff problem?

I saying New York ffs.

But come wear mask. good citizen hard working people quit getting close contact letters jobs every week. Not. Very. Safe. Unfortunately see vaccination becoming political thing. Sure using protection mean guaranteed kids, odds hell lot lower.

This stance basically abstinence education disease. need include time questions reviewers responses Pfizer. assumption review involves lot trial results. 

The application probably includes measures plan take distribution steps taking prevent degradation cross contamination vaccine. 

The application probably lot complex people imagine. 

Finally, critical aspect vaccine rollout earning public trust. 95 percent efficacy data great, vaccine effective enough people willing take it. people willing take process companies FDA transparent thorough, pay long run. Covid altered view towards Americans general: Smart safe stupid spreading. Totally free (if pay insurance) logical conclusion countries testing past sample investigate. people learn!!!!!!!! Attending outdoor events pretty low risk. necessarily attend, long stay away people fine. snap fingers people tell pull mask do. must crazy eyes something. mean say ‚Äúwe fucking make obey us‚Äù? Vaccines important. super expensive too. Spanish flu death toll reported 50 100 million dead. mere 100 per cent variation. expect similar guess. Come dude, clearly messed meant. come Australia considered west Indonesia Singapore within longitude I'll real you. entirely correct wanna sit prove wanna see whats done hold up. her,its sides. Give Google. think countless people got second time much sooner may disagree. I‚Äôm still undulate worse easier second time around. I‚Äôm seeing cases sides. Again. Well 6 months.

Every BODY different. Stop putting timelines shit. makes people know Covid fee invincible, even though months ago could easily get spread again.

Taking step back, it‚Äôs obvious months fueling fire. It‚Äôs articles like get feel immune... go out... get it... spread. Ah. Makes sense you‚Äôre side line what‚Äôs happening US. Like said another comment, entirely unprecedented, top minds world working nonstop speak order end fast fucking possible. 

Yes, science takes time vaccines take time, meantime; let‚Äôs listen people dedicated entire lives this. It‚Äôs okay take good news give break. remember first came back high school. He's talented artist songs like. yes, importantly I'm glad hear he's getting better Right likely number people side won‚Äôt take hate Trump much believe said wrong. Good luck! Sounds right, unfortunately CDC lost credibility Redfield. It‚Äôs almost like timing planned...hmm?!! green Monday indeed Yes, measurable countries. Also deaths per capita we're pretty damn well. Yes covid policy shitty, confusion atrocious. beginning virus 10% mortality rate, dropped 5% 2% 1%. virus caused effects, didn't. virus lived surfaces weeks, hours, transmit surfaces airborne live air hours, reported UV kills instantly. reporting awful too, beginning everything ended mortality patient covid documented covid death even car accidents. reported pneumonia cases documented covid. released hospitals getting government HMO payouts flagging patients covid even flagged covid deaths, numbers got fudged. Non stop confusion past year subreddit contributing confusion news networks. subreddit needs go. It‚Äôs pretty bad Kansas say yet don‚Äôt know many people infected haven‚Äôt infected despite relatively high risk areas, it‚Äôs strange. would expected catch now. It‚Äôs hard tell bad really is. notice someone counting mine today. hadn‚Äôt seen months. I‚Äôve felt different awhile , years actually...and don‚Äôt watch YouTube ... mind seeing way world going last 20years... can‚Äôt tell told truth anything... using example... none bullshit bothers could really careless who‚Äôs president it... hasn‚Äôt change life ... going I‚Äôve experienced seen... realist honestly... it‚Äôs deeper know care know... opinion maybe none us know wtf talking about. I'm bind. live Washington state dad lives Chicago. He's recovering alcoholic me, wife, daughter family see Thanksgiving he's coming Chicago. Luckily live sticks going anywhere. know chance spread transmit me, better mental health us Thanksgiving. told might better come sounded really depressed brought up. sure right answer is. It‚Äôs pretty bad Kansas say yet don‚Äôt know many people infected haven‚Äôt infected despite relatively high risk areas, it‚Äôs strange. would expected catch now. It‚Äôs hard tell bad really is. start you? 
srsly, terrible thing say. rural counties hit yet spiked cities flattened dropped... Great detective work Johnson. Understood. also remove post replied to? Hey california already... except HIV.-. One rule life: Follow money Yeah showing symptoms testing positive 10 days good go I‚Äôm introvert already worked home, hasn‚Äôt bad me. got good using grocery pickup wear mask times go out. problem people feel like tested enough. family keeps saying want new test subjects somehow. People scared possible side effects ""vaccine take years made never one coronavirus"". people know part research mers SARS used h1n1 vaccine pretty bad reputation (which I'm even sure earned).

Add previous medical scandal around levothyroxine France gave breeding ground people full antivax gradually become sceptical vaccines medicine. 

While may appear stupid think quite make sense see reactions among population neither truly aware research works vaccines developed. ok Damn. read ‚Äúat bowling last night‚Äù. ‚ÄúI wOn‚ÄôT sToP LiViNg LiFe!‚Äù 

Uh, excuse me, there, wearing mask? Miss Rona would like word you. People selfish. Tired hearing bull shit rights violated. sucked weeks, it'd done. Actually, 95% certain paid propaganda account. 3 year old account ever posted past 3 months. Almost posts support common right wing talking points except bunch filler bullshit posts sports. 

I calling posts bullshit propaganda. Get fuck troll. scientific group thinks 12 million people infected. That's confirmed cases. actual count least 3x higher that, estimates go much further. long take prevention measures come effect? websites could link information? know. doesn‚Äôt make sense surface, playing long-game here. Zero reason shut now. likely yelled insufferable idiot. us murderers. Death coming

Hunker get swept fooled eye... non-obese half non-male half? got wondering [the real data Puerto and... can't make heads tails it.

If take ""Patients Tested Positive COVID-19, Test Type"" / ""Patients Tested COVID-19, Test Type"", get 10.3%... almost rows indicate percent positive say 99-100%. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Seriously?!   makes much sense, AMERICA style:

Give richers first
Give upper middle class next
Poor immune affected get last idea one talking this, huge news. Yeah directly following ruling protest. pretty even split area mandates even area hospitals begged it. cities surroundings joplin, Webb city, Carthage, Carl junction released going make mandatory. understand it, depressing hell  don‚Äôt know good place ask I‚Äôll try luck.

The masks simple white cotton. work fridge day. warm moist breath makes feel damp awhile. eventually makes nose stuffy it‚Äôs uncomfortable.

Are masks better chance feeling like wet tidy Whiteys face. good choice surrendered virus. Jesus wont help them. Whats funny people stupid huge reason antibiotic resistance. Tuberculosis particular long antibiotic treatment (6 months), people stop taking that, multi-drug resistant strains TB still infects 1/3 world. I'm worried future MRSA coming VRSA well.



Also 67 year old Mom recovering secondary bacterial pneumonia right now, works COSTCO. feel like matter time gets covid, body definitely can't fight right now. kind? Well, stubbornness lead undoing. hate looking way, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs going happen whether believe not. I‚Äôm Indiana surrounded idiots Walmart today. Everyone masks, lot noses. guilty Walmart employees. know, hope right. know much shit take. per article, that's 40 million doses take two doses, 20 enough 20 million people. 

Amazing - enough probably 10% adult population. Light end tunnel (but tunnel going claim another 50,000 lives get there) sounds like logistical nightmare. imagine lines cars outside grocery stores? don‚Äôt think staff.

The realistic answer no, can‚Äôt shut businesses. Society can‚Äôt function way. Yeah ok, need step back YouTube streamers seriously consider checking mental institution. must crazy believe agenda 2‚Äù3‚Äù deep state plot.  (i know ridiculous even mention fun fact: 'heathens' middle ages, namely Danes call vikings, bathed far often Christians whos lands invaded middle ages, took good care long hair.) Except vaccine released speak. mutated drastically...the vaccine wouldn‚Äôt anything. evidence drastic mutations make immunity irrelevant. 

Nice try though. 

Also crystals must need charging. Quick. Get window sill! vibrations getting low. ‚Äî people wearing face masks coverings COVID-19 ‚Äî often ‚Äúblack white thinkers‚Äù believe government health officials lied misled instead simply skeptical, automatically jump to: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt believe anything State University Londrina found people reported ‚Äúantisocial traits,‚Äù low levels empathy high levels callousness risk-taking, less-likely comply Covid-19 prevention measures, wearing mask social distancing. literally anything us election year half country refuse right thing. even referring to? I‚Äôm Michigan they‚Äôre much enforced part Midwest. haven‚Äôt seen anyone Costco, Meijer, Kroger, TJ Maxx, Target without mask.  flown Colorado Orlando spring break.

Yeah it‚Äôs like flipped 9 states red oooh yeah republicans racist scary obvious people buying yachts pandemic relief funds got? actually predict it'll higher - like 650k 750k range. three reasons:

1. Tens millions still travelling Thanksgiving. Household mixing big way viruses transmit.

2. Black Friday absolute fucking chaos year. really think virus many Americans think hoax stop people rioting full blown fist-fights discounted TV? going spread virus even harder injuries occurring fights going overload hospitals.

3. seen worst second wave yet. temperatures get colder, virus going spread harder. believe devil, admit first thought upon seeing photo devil could concocted better timing goal assure maximum spread virus Thanksgiving holiday, many kids going dining multiple generations older relatives. article claim arrived shipment clothing. likely that, compared likelihood low level community spread, like almost everywhere else planet? people quick trot 'greater good' line typically little sacrificed taken agree. vacation got cancelled year I've days since March. I'm runner races got cancelled obvious reasons can't even that. lost several people hugged nieces since March. miss many things. Quarantine sucks big gigantic sweaty monkey balls. want people die **HAD** eat sit restaurant. Well hopefully Biden says do, student loan forgiven. Makes ya wonder huh? Ugh. millisecond see ten cars parking lot large store(I shopping right opening) I'm nope-ing away place warp speed. fucking frustrating see people living best 2020 life family locked since school closed April. Feels like we‚Äôre punished right thing majority people know living consequence free carrying like life normal. brag *my* neutrality, born Canada first word ""Eh."" employer too.

Can't wait anti-vaxers quit announce Covid vaccine mandatory. real feeling will. I'm pretty sure already saw articles hospitals already received vaccine waiting approval. Probably ones got freezers -70¬∞C storage requirement already got it. high priority locations likely sent like described within hours approval since able store months without special freezers. blood bearded sapien may benefit goals hive  Like right 12% positivity rate? Definitely majority reddit way, would think I‚Äôm surprised thought thing would last forever. sounds curiously like saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt live life fear‚Äù justifying eating inside restaurant. Rural communities ones hit hardest least amount resources contain it. Y‚Äôall literally going risk pretty awful circumstances would‚Äôve year two wait out. Really strange decision making process Exactly. ones bitcching loudest shut downs ones causing them!! Pure insanity, selfishness stupidity!  Make America diseased wasteland 2020 odds soooo much higher covid..... America‚Äôs don‚Äôt give fuck. don‚Äôt know people keep questioning America‚Äôs keep things spread Covid. It‚Äôs one gives fuck. It‚Äôs reason system corrupt is. one gives fuck. pandemic shown many USA alcoholics. Yeah many times western sources going keep discounting this? Well, haven‚Äôt anywhere except work grocery store months, would welcome judgement. I‚Äôm also glad don‚Äôt know anyone real life like blatantly excusing selfish behavior others fucking pandemic :)  Apparently not. whole chain comments making think that's wrong think morbidly obese covid would considered comorbidities. still think get covid morbidly obese comorbidities. true?

Edit: Though obviously good reminder Reddit place try learn anything. Test, Trace, Isolate - added comment, thanks. What‚Äôs special June July? people think shutdown worse mitigating disaster. Like, guy, congress abandoned, propagandized defunded education even understand streets demanding action every god damn country automatically. run corporate robber barons turning country mindless plantation.  I'm sitting waiting get second dose shingles vaccine. 

Not paying one cent.

Actually, true. Since insurance covers shot costs $5K year. skipped easter 4th July part flatten curve. government part lock things well enough stop contact trace enforce quarantines.

But even hospitals empty kept things locked enough kill businesses extinguish spread.

And we've continuously told vaccine enough remove restrictions.

So socially isolate forever what's plan?

I'll happy part plan ends crisis. I'm going avoid interacting handful family members hospitals around fewer people normal. observing? testing arm started March. difference three months make? already nine months observation.

Your sentiment dangerous inevitably prolong pandemic. Sorry make political 0 personality look parties Biden New York, Chicago, San Diego??? guess that‚Äôs okay agree political views lol could Trump actually done anything? like COVID forever, virus cycles two weeks, Biden circuit breaker lockdown mitigate spread? already creating excuses Biden? might dumb question, likely see vaccine get licensed manufacturers get faster? Republicans horrified that. I've started see trend people arguing less several hours wait ER normal. not.

7 ridiculous. 4 long, thats people consider normal. true A) need facilities nearby B) need head urgent care unless life threatening. 

If ER literally place nearby, time write local representatives. Hopefully Musk aims sun. America- ""we make china pay virus since fault"" lot US concerns alleviated vaccines nothing Trumps operation warp speed election. Don‚Äôt worry much Germany something help Trump lying effectiveness.

agent orange wonderful job tho

doubt needs assist pooh bear  3 mos seems short IMO we'd swamped re-infections given we're 8-9 mos this. possible people infected back March getting again. also possible really know since testing pretty shit back March. scary. folks freedom ends mine begins. deserve decrease safe. 

We, people, USofA...are village idiots now. friend got figured out. long fair free elections path better free world. Trump said unlimited supply it‚Äôs free... gives? /s Again. selfish? traveling come contact people traveling people entered social contract. ‚ÄúWe decided travel despite risks. families also know risks‚Äù

Everyone traveling won‚Äôt come contact them. 

That‚Äôs works eh? Wont take long. doubling took 18 days. time two doublings new years. üá∫üá∏ ‚ù§Ô∏è Rona Thanks. recall hearing similar explanation back fall. makes sense supply chain can‚Äôt changed easily. ""being frugal longer effective lifestyle used be."" 

You fake cry make fun point. also say ""late stage capitalism."" Everyone knows much expensive housing is. Everyone knows much expensive education is. 

Simple frugality cannot save me, I've done math household budget. Food, entertainment, luxury costs thing cut. House, taxes, medical fixed make budget. 

If think stopping audible subscription getting books library going really help build wealth retire early, wrong. 300,000 dead Christmas go Yes .. again, nothing people. control life. going irresponsible .. going go counter-protest .. going stay home far away them. simple staying home entire country (NOT world) becomes braindead around makes existence 1000x dangerous receive government help? exactly right. Also, probably tell, running short food would nightmare me. mother always wants bring stuffing, brings tiny casserole dish it, one made small family little. make anyway.

Not we'd probably following Africa, India, Brazil.

These places perfectly covered. Use search engine. right wrong reason basically wrong.

 

You understand that, yeah? America nation over-entitled whiners hypocrites. Unfortunately half morons drag rest us them. Let's hope judged way judge others.
Your thinking cruel &amp; inhuman.
You fucking give shit we're fucking human.
There's nothing 'clearly' this.
I'm glad know people like real life. Yes, actually does. Thanksgiving big holiday. always going biggest test people‚Äôs willpower. 

And honestly, get it. I‚Äôve super responsible whole pandemic, fucking *love* Thanksgiving. It‚Äôs favorite day year. family going ahead normal dinner matter say it. know dumb big dinner right now, first event year I‚Äôve tempted turn brain day. Interesting got sick within 24 hours. means likely got infected time days (\~4-5) symptom onset, one caught first gave everyone else home, there'd delay 5 days first one getting ill three. ""Can't happen me!"" ü§† whole lot people empathize more. Apart work(truck driver) supply runs there(groceries cat), I've staying away groups people since March. still friends states taking seriously phone arguments sound like bickering couple.(them telling go out. telling go kick rocks.)


I imagine whenever finally brought form control, going cat. Probably switch back home every night back 3-4 nights regionals. people encounter dispatch shipping clerk same, one three milk plants deliver to. 


Might also see working towards private pilot license new set ""loner hobbies"" take on. barely coming shell several years year. pandemic less made back-step significantly becoming socially distant monster more. Got embrace suck. can't shit .. thing control life. yes .. break leg, matters. staying home .. also reduce risks accident outside. everyone right thing essential overcoming COVID-19 people refusing comply CDC guidelines, America inevitably worst period pandemic!ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíîüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüöë Unfortunately bus long left USA. chance USA go China solution NY first wave. Seal NYC like Wuhan testing, tracing quarantine everywhere else. window USA had. almost beg parents cancel trip Puerto Rico December 26th, even got mom cancel Thanksgiving dinner (I believe invited brother sister, still, absolutely not) I'm opening idea cancelling Christmas (I think brothers sisters, course, absolutely fucking not) saying stuff like ""oh well come Christmas! eat back porch blah blah blah"" I'm going get cancel it, need work slowly.

I want say parents extremely careful take every precaution necessary, never going unless necessities go masks/gloves/sanitizer/the works. honestly think they've enough figured one time holidays couple family members would okay, take risk? vaccine close top it?

It genuinely feels like full time job taking care family keeping informed, idk would happen here. brothers sisters clearly find problem coming holidays, hell would happened moved back year? guess that's glass-half-full way looking moving back in. understand jobs pushed public eye more. Temperature part seasonality, way drives people indoors affects droplet temperatures lead drier air, may dehydrate mucous membranes, preventing body effectively defending respiratory virus infections. I'm even sure start mess word blob. one, cases, deaths also increasing hospitals starting feel it. Secondly, really matter guy reddit thinks China, life back normal took measures needed contain it. someone explain this? Moderna part warp speed? Moderna get tax money make vaccine charging vaccine? Freelancers without employers live directly income needed pay back aid aid expenditures. one less expenditures use mostly income living almost got nothing Germany. Small businesses struggle much medium sized ones. Democratic society lives dies capability pragmatism people. Education critical enough I‚Äôd liken Food, Water, Shelter, government isn‚Äôt able function effective without. 

Ideally, Europe America work toward cultural shift emphasizes education point reverence. Knowledge provides civilians power, exercised via voting. Makes glad I'm 50 boring. individual sellers operating black market, might well make N95 masks require prescription. Doctors like it, pharmacists like it, would bring order situation. 1920s post Spanish Flu war say differently. People gonna go wild. wish optimism. Look amount people traveling thanksgiving. Isn‚Äôt thanksgiving travel 10% last year? 

I work medicine. seen nurses go lives taking precautions - going out, eating restaurants, kids come home thanksgiving going eat arrive air. course attendings engaging too. seems much common work among people know outside that, anecdotal. results people infected week ago need wait days see really today. True. read genetic tracing it‚Äôs really interesting. Thanks clarification. 5 bucks grocery store gets entire already cooked rotisserie chicken, saying. think lot problem since much right moved away cable news gets info from... questionable sources... even really understand what's asked them.

One friends (who moved midwest) says people saying ""they want us wear masks FOREVARR!!"" (because smarter people) assumed meant way avoid covid, even vaccine likely forever (but nowhere near threat now) but... get it. masks protect pregnant working nursing home.

People think they're afraid get it, what's point? course already gotten expect everyone comfortable them...

But truth is, CDC even recommend concept using masks PPE last month so. done beginning, chance relative containment. truly kindness virtues I'm honestly sick narrative... literally slow shit hospitals get overcrowded (yes, happened while, way things looking looks like winter gonna get worse...)

The people live areas high distrust government, media general. I'm northeast... rural areas around different. people connected part they're fine that. Exponential growth friend.. going linear. change way behave.. 1 million cases day .. .. days eating uncooked chicken come middle. Ok, let's reduce taxes get rid healthcare. Might well get rid education

""This, unironically""

-America Bro density Seoul insane. tired argument that's actually factual? Lmao Christ one ignorant posts I've ever read Reddit. Staggering lack education knowledge world recent world history East deal multiple outbreaks past 30 years. 

But what's almost embarrassing go spouting bullshit arrogantly. easy see US lost quarter million read miserable excuses political, social community failure world's richest country. hoped excuse might young deep know not. affect would matter!! pay taxes America Canada business split two. tell you. American taxes more. every tax Bracket I've in. amount deduct less america. cost actually file cause way complicated US accountant charge it. Im Military.

But point Military logistical capability long first vaccination ""officially"" immune virus? Even 1 million day, take another year infect every one reach Herd immunity. South Korea actually large population. handled well beginning wirh mass testing contact tracing. rad. wondering looking exact thing day looking NYTimes data. time think work it.. wonder could drop county level data I'm seeing outbreaks state rural counties seem dramatically higher per capita. Rounding state level fully capture (in math terms) rural areas seem getting hit substantially harder, probably due mask mandate social distancing political. agree premise political too.

I think visualize split state bar horizontally red blue show factors state add whole state's % compared other.

Just thought. Cool site. ancestors founders nation would shake heads disgust. 

The rest world looks pity. laugh. 

American exceptionalism needs wound back. Heroin. Can't speak elsewhere, every delivery person who's brought stuff immunocompromised mother since beginning hell-demic worn mask oftentimes even gloves. exceedingly grateful delivery folks taking care themselves, others. eyes. odds offering? danger obviously people chewing frozen meat, people might come contact infectious material handling meat, whether might selling, buying preparing it. 

tldr maintain personal hygiene handling frozen meats, anyway dont spank touch keyboard afterwards lol. need tempted. going 100% correct choice. working convince cancel too. probably able convince them, glad part staying away. daily bouts parents. really budge holidays year,we family coming states; wish luck I'll see guys survive winter. herd immunity without mostly vaccinated people herd, create herd immunity blunt spread. Spread without vaccine plague. fiancee, technically healthcare worker (works food service elderly living facility), told required receive vaccine. Weird requiring get since actual healthcare worker. people US see one article news report Melbourne lockdown decide whole country living like year continue rest time virus around. fail realise Australia living normal life quite time Victoria joined them. don‚Äôt worry infecting loved ones overwhelming health care system. live haven‚Äôt even asked wear masks unless it‚Äôs get tested go doctor hasn‚Äôt recorded cases long. wife it. sister husband it. still decided drive parents house thanksgiving. It‚Äôs easy far apart do. 

My grandfather died past spring found old ration stamps WWII going things. laughed thought Americans today sacrifice anything like that. can‚Äôt even stay home wear mask protect someone‚Äôs life, we‚Äôre capable uniting common enemy anymore flit means give comfort. We‚Äôve fallen far.  people hard-hit areas power tell covidiotic neighbors that. :( 'Same here.

If vaccine/any vaccine approved regulatory bodies England, I'll research providing risk outweighed benefits get jab. expect vaccine risk free, time desire take significant risk.

I reading summary Pfizer/BioNTech trials Washington Post, I'm close I'm simply repeating said article. account 100 children included trials start finish, ages 12-15. basis think would irresponsible parent young child put child forward jab without boat load research beforehand.

I listening scientist/vaccine type person Radio 4 day, claimed safety issues new vaccine generally known within 2 3 months uptake population. he's correct, time vaccine gets safety issues seen light day, irony people trying keep safe exposed safety risks front queue vaccine. Excellent communication VIC premier too. Early likened health bushfire. used analogy fighting ember attacks suburbs began testing blitz start lockdown. sort messaging motivated community pull together. Thanks this. I'm California feel like I'm taking fucking crazy pills mother f@#$ers. young people: mostly fucking people forties fifties posting pics either going every night little house parties constantly.

We fucked. Abhorrent experimentation US government (*coughcoughcough*Tuskegeesyphilisexperiment*coughcough*) also tons Black people US super-wary getting COVID vaccine, even tons Black people landing hospital and/or outright dying due virus members demographics (notice said **most**, **all**) US. 

Good job, US government! managed kill people's trust use science make sick! serious?! find YouTube link? almost can't believe people damn stupid. Video report includes clip attack Synopsis: We're fucked. birthday (11/21) ended midnight today. Looks like may ""alone"", alone. Also ton time direct Sun, people general spend time outside. Im South Africa worn masks since began hardly anyone idiot losing freedoms, also hard lockdown well 6 weeks wrecked economy didnt act like babies, needed grewter good. come better west countries (well that's dont fuck us prevent us getting vaccines available) Depends told keep quiet. national government planning lockdown whole city province getting pieces place lock down, telling say word would make sense. lots conflicting information regarding disease early on. So, bother allowed disclose information without permission. 

As far know, local health authorities mandating masks telling people stay indoors time.

Also, read rumors second national health team visited Wuhan, confirmed H2H transmission happening, report also mentioned local government officials hiding something. So, feeling, true, national government officials like.. know hiding this, highly suggest keep quiet. think 30 conex cooler/freezer combos old unit ft Carson. saw real use state side food use Iraq. One could easily think they‚Äôre driving circles fact. Coronavirus capable getting *inside chicken egg*, unassisted, we've got problems. hate question delved deserves most. real, frontline workers, fuck yes, can‚Äôt fight shit real get sick die. Y‚Äôall care sometimes shows. 2 tests done, rapid urgent care PCR th ER next day. Urgent care informed false negativity rate checked in. xrays done negative. gave z-pak prednisone plus inhaler worked wonders. turned lovely drive! protesting elections (which suspended account COVID) original protest due criminal extradition bill. 

So pure legal terms still great deal liberty Beijing‚Äôs new security law may threaten security practice - correct regard. It‚Äôs almost foregone conclusion continue lose rights years come. right free assembly local elections already come attack new law. 

But still conflating democratic elections civil liberties. related, exclusionary, concepts. 

The example Trump democratic country wannabe autocrat - assertion fact shouldn‚Äôt controversial. Italy Germany democratic countries prior Mussolini Hitler. contrast, Russia China democratic prior Stalin Mao. Hence comparison Trump. previous employer mine paid everyone's shots even company's offensively expensive insurance. logic cheaper people call flu. guess cost job, kind needed one anyways. US really reacted beige alert Perhaps not. article looking democracies East comparison. South Korea, etc. Yup know. pick friend quarantine hotel long ago. need apologize skepticism, rarity days. read data. Shit takes time  Pffft denied quickly, trump yet give $1200 stimulus fiance  point numbers stop going maximum testing capacity? maybe you‚Äôre right go local subreddit level ignorance post staggering. it‚Äôs like aren‚Äôt 50 million people traveling time. surely nobody countries traveling either. article looking specific demographic fear monger. ‚ÄúJust one holiday man, selfish!??, yeah ten vaccines four cases last month get zero.‚Äù Thanksgiving 2025 lived Florida almost 2 years tell fact entitled people aren‚Äôt coming town. Florida far entitled place ever been. old rich assholes think world revolves around them. poetic years ago watched anxiously marketing Winter Coming now... well, it‚Äôs truly here. Eh, get enough deaths disease cause war violence. Two years, ended 18 months something stuff going around Franken's seat. no, Obama could passed socialized medicine then. Break wind I'm sorry, defending China? investigating virus since December earlier, consistently fed misinformation came wet market. Seriously, defend China? Imagine banned smoking restaurants public places fought reduce number smokers year year. : / Well leadership ( HA) wont stay put lead example.... benefit/risk ratio vaccinating children incredibly lower vaccinating at-risk adults. surprise studies far along kids complete quarantine last exposure another human 14 days negates need test all. infected last exposure taking account 3-4day incubation period, day 14 would isolated ten days therefore infectious. need test all. makes money. 

UAE requires testing order *leave* country, among many situations require testing. 

Testing gives one clue might going on. really needs done conjunction quarantine. polls done first phase III results? think numbers ought changed, probably keep increasing people think enough testing. 100% false Wow, people better job Thanos ever did.  McDonalds ditched artisan chicken sandwich still it. could possibly going thru December 9th that‚Äôs important right now? mean, bump one front line, please. I'm pretty sure minister health said indirect ""mandatory"" vaccination. I'm sure since bought vaccines 3 million people... None skill useful delivering frozen vaccine glass vials. hey. You‚Äôre cool. get it. think testing abilities would able even show that. think we've hit daily cap. West likes think bastion individual choice individual rights. Looking facts US prison detention rates UKs response NI Troubles, France Algeria tells reality something quite different. UK currently aiming repeal Human Rights Act take military frame. go outside something, maybe visit family.  guy looks like evil rich villain generic tv show always chance people asymptomatic wake one day blood clot working sway brain. People may continue die even pandemic over. I'm pretty sure vaccine that's temperature controlled GPS tracked would delivered better run mill amazon package. Looking North South Dakota's death rates, hell matter population density is? appears stupidity density far relevant. I‚Äôll report back remember. neither effective enough definitively say don‚Äôt Covid. 

Presymptomatic people rarely likely test positive. usually come false negatives. compare cases deaths per capita. Compare equivalent sized cities. Sydney Melbourne 4+ million people each. 12th consecutive day! Swedes better following ""recommendations"" peoples... likely helping bit. Sounds like mods job. Since when?! get that. right call keep live drive get food. guess poor people would move public transport, townships. reason people insist fake news makes feel good themselves. feel superior people fooled government. deathrate disease high enough trigger fear death people, nothing override desire validation. it, focused shit become, leads strange moments like dying patients denying covid exists even though what's killing them. outliers. people pretending covid exist survive this. seriously debating ever safe enough justify grabbing energy drinks normally rely work like April. 

What hell happened Kansas? Honest question, mortality rate virus definitely low enough understand people looking afraid. 

Old people, people pre-existing condition ones vulnerable it. problem though wherever goes, overwhelms local health services. 

If unchecked, get point people could've saved die. include individuals sick Covid-19

Where I'm from, non-emergency surgeries cancelled. people surgeries postponed would've improved day day lives.

Have ever considered these? century pandemic, they've already made vaccine it. needs mass produced, enough population inoculated. really care this? Please. stopped reporting htu transmission later. yes country free flow information. wouldn‚Äôt arrested doctor discussing colleagues online either. mean, could link you, article Romanian. Anyways, [in case want use Google shitshow really - imagine giving anti-COVID / anti-vaxxers news football team (that actually best team) 23 fake positives. Pretty much gave arguments needed take seriously. 200,000 cases day time bump numbers Thanksgiving, give us enough time bump numbers office Christmas parties, give us enough time bump numbers New Years parties.

On plus side, able get Valentine‚Äôs Day reservations pretty easy next year. think Philippines 1.2M cases, testing much less? dormitories reason Singapore many cases: testing reason found all. False. Taiwan repeated internet speculating. document. I'll enjoying family. already, actually work living. may comfort Europeans even incompetent European governments seem like models public-health management compared reckless ineptitude Trump administration US. bigger international picture far less flattering. Europeans like think societies epitome global sophistication progress, governments economies dealing pandemic much worse China East Asia catalogue failures long. European governments unduly complacent Covid beginning year. failed prevent virus‚Äôs spread Europe, forced economically devastating lockdowns prevent hospitals overwhelmed. Confinements eased virus fully Worse, summer months infections low, governments failed develop effective mass testing contact tracing systems would prevented resurgence cases. Now, face second wave threatens overwhelm healthcare systems, governments imposing painful new social economic restrictions every European societies seem offer enviable combination freedom, security quality life. also associated unenviable mix shambolic governance draconian lockdowns, creaking public healthcare systems, individual irresponsibility unnecessary deaths.

Ouch drivers need license. Lab jobs office jobs. Yeah, really hospital beds. filled mortality rate diseases conditions related COVID increase. beyond people get heads around this. One year? deserve downvote, case. everyone else decides think like you, that's additional year death, wrecked economies despair. 

Do research, read vaccine science, make decision yourself. set arbitrary timeline one year. That‚Äôs true United States though. enough food feed everyone, even despite factory farming. Food insecurity United States result food shortages. It‚Äôs Fcking sad beyond belief badly west mangled things. Truly horrific. 23 false positives, I'd suggest test person tested football team. Perhaps virus one person. completely get it, said people risk, avoid types situations. reality is, can‚Äôt force masks, try you‚Äôll never succeed. 

I‚Äôm Arkansas work right now, I‚Äôd say chances someone wearing mask 50/50 (says lot people here). I‚Äôm NY it‚Äôs odds someone wearing mask 99.9%.

What think masks strongly encouraged, NEVER forced. decent human wear them, shitty/stupid person won‚Äôt. judge. Hey wouldn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre welcome. takes time investigate never-seen-before virus. expect China instantly know let know? country that? people literally already died covid reinfection  January? Try middle December rate. googled it, sure enough even 6 Springfields across Canada fairness, Elon Musk seemed interested helping pandemic approached whole thing scientist. actually quit job healthcare asked work day fever. Half job covid swabs. Also missing might possibly covid would give points warning. ALSO, test positive covid symptoms expected work. covid hospital capacity co workers dropping like flies.  Yes. shitstains!  motherfuckers think hoax beyond me.

Pretend 0% fatality rate treatment, required hospitalization rate. We'd still fucked. Hospitals still going fill up, doctors going forced perform triage medicine, people car accidents going nowhere go. I'm worried winter. people still think ""it's flu"" think safe age group care risk put others in. 

The interesting question lot governments continue allow flights. it‚Äôs absolutely insane. aren‚Äôt really planning, hoping. won‚Äôt near low enough numbers safely open things early December like talking about. It‚Äôs stupidity. way. We‚Äôre downvoted bc people DONT like truth. happen. initial wave New York, people stay home relative's bodies, days, could picked unexpected sudden high rate death. MONTHS ago. think we're stupid? think we're fools? That‚Äôs thinking.

If focus economy, produce lot goods services deliver dead grandma need actual lockdown, need close damn bars. tangent that, need pay bar owners employees one wants that. deal illness like 100 years

And pathetic thing handled WAAAAAAY better then, ya know stupidity nearly bad today people actually trusted medical professionals  short civil liberties worth deaths Sweden say Norway... constitutional standpoint. That's rather interesting.

But explain big popular support policies Sweden, whilst comparable countries seen borderline lunacy. asked pandemic started one would look Sweden, would thought Sweden would pushed eradication followed Nordic bubble. sort civil discipline see Scandinavia would made possible.  Across France Germany people aren‚Äôt listening lockdown rules, actual laws, vs suggestions travel US. 
  
This isn‚Äôt uniquely american problem. Doesnt take 3-4 days get results? disgraceful ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running room.¬† COVID patients, acute patients well. ask again:¬† patients go, care them?‚Äù Brown said.


On Friday, Brown joined chorus local government health care leaders implore public change behavior wearing masks, keeping distance staying home possible.


‚ÄúI know we‚Äôve heard statements made hospitals overwhelmed, ICUs full.¬† untrue. misleading. think provides false sense security community. representing reality really is.¬†


The reality beds cannot occupied without staff care patients. beds available full,‚Äù said.



Many COVID patients Springfield hospitals reside rural counties outside Springfield area. think pretty obvious previous comment governments least recommend use masks indoor environments. Even 2 meter distancing rule place - environments grocery stores indoor environments air circulation high-risk, even assuming everyone perfectly follows 2 meter distance rule. Laughs future robot society know US ever able say regionally again. Like ever. know things get better vaccine, apparently us.  need identify behaviour patterns. vaccinate everyone groups. Look bright side, cases plateau testing supplies run One positives getting watch science technology work. mRNA adenovirus vaccines, genomic sequencing, large scale testing, statistical models tracking databases, digital contact tracing/monitoring even teleconferencing. 

In 1918 even know virus. time around know much it. 

I also believe things much better result. 1918 flu horrendously deadly probably spread much easily due lack knowledge precautions. 

It shame though doomed repeat lot mistakes again. lot criticism Belgiums policy. Noone holding Belgian model. People, including Swedes, holding Sweden model follow.

Thats why. point probably heading herd immunity.

I don‚Äôt believe without effective vaccine near-ubiquitous vaccination. Ah yes, man made whole pandemic story eventually chip us vaccine.

/s help trump murder 250,000 americans far counting know right... scary shit Yes, measuring this? following everyone positive time asking symptoms? That's pretty important distinction. Comorbidity. _Morbidly_ obese. doctor, done research, sound like one might related other. verification 1 month antibody test, closest thing ‚Äúofficial‚Äù 2 weeks plenty antibodies Nope! NW 90 miles agree consider pandemic matter public health. responsible you, wear mask risk health others, regardless others wear mask not. surgical masks wearing protecting others yourself. 

But, think damage inordinately hitting anti-maskers protecting themselves. 

Forcing masks right seems way inflame situation that's already boiling point. Unfortunately France country highest proportion antivaxers. 54% even plan getting  second time kinda proves first time misfortune either. No, Florida. Florida went Trump. Well drivers license already stops :(  waves combined rogue wave. That‚Äôs actually current theory rogue waves formed ocean. Ah ok sorry troll message there. Hope get plusher back good day! reddit too. think part problem true crime imagining people like Ted Bundy much smarter others. No, he‚Äôs special. People don‚Äôt pay attention reward sociopathy country. Strictly Amazon prime now. damm fast r0 rate 2.7 &amp; 5.7 (depending government cite) that's entire period one person infectious.

Infecting 4 people 18 hours 10 times rate. restaurants higher risk, notice closed countries. Liberals really feel superior covid don‚Äôt they? They‚Äôre loving every second sad several doctors gotten accused falsifying charts patient covid believe it. flights airbnbs cheaper usual that's people taking opportunity? Rebels makes sound cool. 

We need find something makes sound idiotic. way planet see hitting 500K day USA. way. hits 500K something done pandemic response team + vaccine closer. 

I mean 200K already crazy, think 500K allowed happen. would destroy every single thing US stands for. world never see leader again. implications pertain meat processing facilities. unfortunately, explaining joke always ruins joke  Well I'm woman lol, husband one US. I'm Germany sadly drivers license.  got free 5lb one Ibotta Walmart pickup, supposed like rebated said sold didn‚Äôt charge card still picked up. figure cook turkey. child due June condescending, cold, uneducated thing say. sounds like rough time pandemic I‚Äôm really sorry that. 

I‚Äôll repost said 

We 20 month old wanted another. live rural area spend lot time hiking pandemic hasn‚Äôt really effected us much. (Our state early adopter masks mandates) don‚Äôt go eat see family/friends activities relatively same. jobs let us work home.

My wife open mental health actively make sure doesn‚Äôt get overwhelmed (although, days that‚Äôs granny babysitting day - quarantine bubble)

Our logic - always plan. Let‚Äôs safe let covid stop lives. sat around waited - that‚Äôs chunk life wasted won‚Äôt get back.

Edit: also discovered new hobbies, things enjoy, wife closer ever. get chose come pandemic - that‚Äôs choice. wife chose self-betterment expanding family. Someone told imagine rich work get poverty. 

It worked yet. mean really get worse? I‚Äôm nearish ohio one. exact thought. Dayton ohio isn‚Äôt well number right now. children‚Äôs hospital taking adults since hospitals running room kid‚Äôs daycare closed week next. another baby coming around Christmas, we‚Äôre going keep toddler indefinitely next week parental leave. I‚Äôm seeing horrific consequences rebuttal, even anything doesn‚Äôt apply kids able school. Teachers school hellish many children. happen Menards near you, they‚Äôve company policy masks must worn stores months least good compliance it, sell masks door $1 don‚Äôt allow without one. I‚Äôd second going early even *must* go. somehow could chill six months, let science take course, re-emerge 6 months brave new world. US really bad going get worse. France ia also terribly.


This pandemic Wests finest hour. People buying lottery tickets: ‚ÄúHey, ya never know!‚Äù

Getting dying covid lot likely winning lottery. No, good thing think beforehand. good thing apply measures early course, plan future never bad thing. Guess we'll find dumb 70 million Well days away getting visa. medical exam February 25, interview consulate March 4th would've visa two weeks after. interview man said everything good documents. 
But March 11th everything shut down. consulate told can't issue visas moment ask 30 days later, April. did, trump issued proclamation denied visa given out. 
So visa stuck right issuance entire time already. Mathematically, makes sense health care workers nursing homes get first. scheduled be. nurse CNA two oftentimes entire wing care.

I know checking words, thorough. POTUS idiot. people support still ALSO mindless idiots. unfortunately leads conclusion bot mindless, irrefutable, idiot defending person let 200.000 people die commanding 'most powerful country world'. 

Where people would condemn savagery would speak manners tones programming unable comprehend stupidity choice, wish defend person caused 200000 deaths, little done control covid pandemic ignoring everything going yet another game golf calling critics Fake News. 

The POTUSs actions clearly childish retarded. Calling SUCKER diminutives curse words unbecoming good taste, morals etiquette, considering target probably plainly understated.... surely entitled calling uncivilized immature, concept world instead linear programming.

As mindful consider decisions let verified human moderators sleuth instead. would wiser go search react judge opinions, carried majority people globe.

I hope one creators reads place exception foul language Trump mentioned Direct indirevt need this. Great Dune reference! Jesus Christ Fun fact, initial shutdown kept liquor stores open essential businesses. couldn‚Äôt risk alcoholics needing hospitalization withdrawals. article like shoot guy ladder, say kill died falling ladder.  good side - less vaccines needed Yes, possibly, 5-6 approved vaccines January so, seems possible. number cases meaningless stat.

Testing shown WILDLY inaccurate. watching 'daily counts' libtards new game show... means nothing give something cower fear about, hilarious, thinking doddering old fool Biden whore VP 'fix it'.

You currently .00078% chance death (78 per 100,000) CV-19.

Tell people scared? agree, even drive across town... I'd shop elsewhere. started testing children. Someone another sub kid enrolled trials.  feeling we'll continue see headline repeated least next months.

This holiday season could definitely boost deaths stringent containment measures taken now. Warmer weather plus whole Vitamin thing means Florida won‚Äôt bad behavior colder states, good ill. live Florida many people acting like covid doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt bad ‚Äòthey‚Äô predicted‚Äù must mean it‚Äôs ok. American hospitals collapse millions die preventable diseases. think upper middle class drives economy? buy stuff? stuff produced them? risk getting sick exposed impoverished workers get items desire? Surely feel entirely safe. 10%?! Yeah won‚Äôt stupid people get hit hardest?  charge healthcare providers mark administration $25-37 end consumer pays? like get dose Ibuprofen hospital bill insurance $72? wish could understand article it‚Äôs Greek me. kind think necessary us. way US take seriously, someone love gets seriously messed killed it.

If dont get painfully wrecked it, next time happens, wont take seriously either, could easily worse deadly.

Asia learned bird flu, ones take seriously. need traumatic event. Apparently 250k dead isnt traumatic enough. Maybe hit close 1mil people willl wake up.  honestly don‚Äôt believe it.  fucked thing even busy. Doctors take time Nope, 'at least' 'at most'. Second, demographics earlier later inflections likely different. Misleading isn‚Äôt population adjusted. quote emergency physicians journal,
In would today, present population, 1,400,000 people die

So calculations around .18 population adjusted Spanish flu‚Äôs use 250,000/1,400,000. could get 1-pound turkey $4. single, get 8-ounce turkey $2. you‚Äôre making sandwich, buy 4-ounce turkey. also know wear mask, hard, yet can't even manage that. So, many sources need see believe it? last times shot China-made fake news... American here, China atrocious job handling virus hiding months world. saying China ""told us bullets"" bullshit. Pfizer estimating 50 million doses available December produce 1.3 billion doses 2021. lot logistics work look like vaccine broadly available quickly. Link [here.  Lol...I needed that, thank you. You‚Äôve got figured Good joke, make anything said less factual. fantasize buying ad billboard near hospital ""Was turkey dinner worth it?"" posted it. True, death rate climb well. (Redditors) willing argue deaths caused covid two months? 600+ cases Selangor worrisome. think reading something I'm saying there. I'm sure bringing median income trying shame people using convenient deliver service sells everything groceries clothing, know, pandemic. prefer everyone shop offend sensibilities? What's useless? Everything? person gets mad someone using food stamps cell phone? 

There's several countries higher median incomes US. Median income account cost living, proportion payment production, anything else offset it. median income US rises $2000 everything costs increase eaten up, means nothing. 

I'm talking various ways people use income fulfilled. range acceptable jobs (ie jobs provide enough cover basic needs) lower was. Trying expand range jobs requires taking huge amounts debt. Property ownership terms housing was. debt. alternative college longer results able work way part time job, even full time job. People supplement one job meet basic needs. There's less time work leisure time family. work job never wanted order home, finance car get job. retirement. suddenly medical debt fall down. paying half rent bank tried improve situation great invisible hand deem ""marketable skill"" despite one started. joys eating socializing, maybe buying $10 candle Amazon crummy apartment smells little better. 

I can't really explain clearer. I'm interested reddit argument premises someone thinks there's problem economy people buying video games Amazon. reason said anything US live can't speak places. can't tell mad insulted America, didn't, American somehow offended you. countries handled better leaders willing intervene ways government wasn't. in, things necessary help people. US helping people bad might create expectation help future. hero wear mask!! Yeah that's said like 98% economy oil exports like Iraq/Afghanistan nothing disaster. healthcare worker, I‚Äôm fucking sick (covididiots) shit. can‚Äôt anymore. can‚Äôt deny absence. seems like people don‚Äôt give shit anymore. They‚Äôll take risk that‚Äôs takes families. need less freedom, enforced government?  I‚Äôve self isolating since April. I‚Äôve probably left house less 20 times, non covid related doctors visits. really don‚Äôt want catch virus travel Tuesday something can‚Äôt miss come right back home. I‚Äôm pretty anxious airport. selfish prick. bet turn car headlights dusk ""I see fine"" without first clue stick everyone else road may well poorer eyesight you. Many people already got virus probably think immune   ""Some us right thing... fuck selfish pieces shit aren‚Äôt. even virus already.""  that's opinion. guess quicker way actually meet God. Free testing CA American contact tracing apps phones? Fairly easy prove exposure several confirmed cases reinfection. driven fear much unknown. know know. Yeah, basically like people Spanish Flu pandemic, barely know anything, words CGP Grey: actions judged now, judged future, based current knowledge, based knowledge future people have. confused going moment, someone may enlighten I‚Äôm struggling understand they‚Äôre still allowing people travel? 

I‚Äôm UK although haven‚Äôt best reaction, least told travel. holiday booked end year swiftly cancelled travel company due UK travel restrictions.

I feel like never ending US. Air Raid Shelter? dare tell do, impinging freedoms...... mentality people stockpiling toilet paper baked beans doomsday cannot spend 5 mins house without protesting rights. autoimmune disease feel like doctors really ignore issues autoimmune diseases, brain fog overlooked can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù test.

It‚Äôs terrible people may issues too, one semi positive thing come could medical community may invest treating autoimmune diseases. taking mask actually spitting people objectively worse wearing mask? Fuk china. almost unlimited sick leave Germany. average workers sick 10.9 days (2019 data)

So tiny step 2 weeks ""unlimited"" It‚Äôs decent prediction FUNCTIONAL world would react pandemic. Governments job, crook advertising false medicine arrested, etc. way went real world much worse - crook advertising false medicine US president! WWJD Maybe bit resigning fate. 

""Sooner later going happen irrespective do. best I'm delaying inevitable. Maybe mild, maybe bad, maybe I'll die. going happen anyway may well go ahead like.""

Of course vaccine announcements give hope somewhat control 12 months so. seems like fairly reasonable price actually. thought would gouging everyone thousands. Also, reinfection dead. use amount. point everyone buys toilet paper every time go grocery store, now, staring extended lockdown, everyone buying pack time.

And fuck, going buy one, might well buy two... people think that, *panic*. objection headline people buying paper again, really panic involved. much freedom people comment needs upvotes obey higher authority.""

Try telling COVID. Yet COVID defeats 'divinely ordained' germfests, know they'll claim god's died miserably, never admitting they're wrong. enjoy this, give ‚ÄúThe Undoing Project‚Äù Micheal Lewis listen. 

It‚Äôs got sections feel like filler, helps tease *why* people react way. *The hospitals done find oil there...* aren‚Äôt going get herd immunity. get 90 days. 

It‚Äôs humanities new ‚Äúseasonal virus‚Äù kind way flu future, won‚Äôt able eradicate covid without global support year you‚Äôll get current covid vaccine prevent it. It‚Äôll probably mutate we‚Äôll see like flu, try predict strain prevalent year. really hope gets less lethal favor infecting hosts we‚Äôve fucked year I‚Äôve lost hope.

There‚Äôs evidence currently suggests get anything temporary immunity covid. Invading China wrong size war, need liberate someone resource rich ideally can't really shoot back soon find right country hold responsible we're gonna liberate fuck I'm sure. promise brightest minds Boeing, Halliburton, KBR, others searching diligently country behind virus. Clever... üôÑ People terrified this. It‚Äôs Covid patients affected. Minor shit suddenly becomes life-threatening. 

I spent two nights hospital tiny cut hand got infected. local hospital Wales pretty full right came full lockdown. took 7hrs get IV antibiotics infection spreading arm. situation full healthcare collapse, suddenly minor cuts become fatal. Empathised think like is, do. thing country (Spain). sentence quote makes sense unless equate ""technocrats"" ""economists"". indeed, West shown run economists ilk - i.e., dogmatic, indoctrinated, non-scientific short-term optimizers.

Actually Eastern countries sound much closer ""run technocrats"" West - since COVID, before. guess sentence nothing one example Western hubris (""hey, make technical decisions, unlike Asian unwashed savages!"") main culprit situation West. can't believe it. Feeling disbelief reading that, almost nervous laugh. Europe, point second wave surge, countries closing again, lockdowns, stay home mandates, travel bans etc. even hard measures avoid second wave crush hospital system mass death event.

And Americans organising Thanksgiving. mad lads.

Hey epidemic dynamic quite simple beggining, happens Europe happens US weeks later. See already deadly wave first one. That's currently least another 100k deaths pile up. additional people already statistically dead, can't anything that, people catching disease last weeks today.

The question remaining America chooses hit brake hard RIGHT NOW. continue total madness, 100k additional deaths rather 300k more.

Please something. distressing. know Senate controls government? little bit late rather late never. National wide measures could save hundreds thousands lives. worth it. MD here, neither colleagues feel way. It‚Äôs rushed, it‚Äôs proven safe. Meanwhile COVID wiping millions, leaving others likely long lasting organ damage. Nurses country receive exactly 0 vaccinology/virology/epidemiology, yet always first give ‚Äòprofessional opinion‚Äô. really - lose benefits would struggle send kid preschool. yes...

Like masks wont work 100% - work 80% (random number) social distance reduces odds 80% (random again... odd same...) also, get protection 96%... wrong people

Lol, vietnam infinitely better geographical position germany. There's basically China, shut shit extremely fast, locked people homes on. border NOTHING compared Germany/France, Germany/Austria, Germany/Poland, Germany/Czech, Germany/Netherlands borders on.

There factors involved too.

If truly believe reason country like India Cambodia better Germany, better response lost mind.

Go take look Delhi looks compared Berlin. think officially Delhi fewer cases per capita Berlin. Maaayyybe something else also going Indian culture superior handling disease outbreaks compared German.

You're welcome explain India fewer deaths per capita Germany, one countries Europe best. Seriously, try give explanation.

New Zealand also done better almost asian country, maybe factors besides sort mystical east asian culture. also thought vaccine would take least 18 months (from March) along without knowing risk-production would take place.

This also little data come yet make accurate predictions. end first wave start second wave. Tards rise again. America gonna break million dead Covid. that's vaccine highly visible horizon, care. nation instant gratification they'd rather kill family miss big turkey dinner.

However, significant minority U.S. concerned notion Liberty unwilling sacrifice anything, hell everyone else consequence. people want around everyone forced take flu, pneumonia covid vaccines, opting out. volunteered sister's family 1st, calling everyone trying get everyone come Thanksgiving!!!! agree theory Sweden's divergence neighbors contributed higher death rates next door unfortunately.

What's sources statement?  scenario could see people get rather combative try tell happen, (it used ‚Äúcould happen‚Äù couple weeks ago, believe happen). don‚Äôt want let imagery enter reality. looks like reality going enter reality. people time test Corona, travelling, dont belive it? sorry native english speaker give **** recommendations. another record shattered :( sick yet?

See wrong.

We always assumed disease spread country people would want avoid it.

Not brain dead fucking morons screaming ""freedom"" asked wear fucking mask.

The biggest issue people keep parties indoor gatherings. opinion? think general distancing masks work. may anecdotal seems rare anyone known others known sick going store eating distanced. parties, packed bars, close contact house gatherings. family get vaccinated, I‚Äôm longer taking precautions. anti-vaxxers shouldn‚Äôt rely society protect them.

Only because, shit hits fan, want sociopaths think agreed end. want ""Told so"". Lower cased hospital bothered Mankind invented thing called straw vain. lead horse water but... Well, hopefully means distribute virus anyone wants it, sooner. people see safe, willing take coincide availability. literally moving goalposts. want order push bullshit narrative reduce one 250k minimum, America 100% underreporting death toll, mere percentages comparison overall population. 

We even recorded proof nation's leader calling someone notify intentionally downplaying severity virus.

Excess deaths nation 30 percent due one fucking cause that's virus.

So say, dont look number cases influence hospitalization rates turn death rates, look death rates put head sand like I'm doing.

Nope. vote benefits know game played.

If smart, maybe learn next election cycle matter side political aisle say we're on. actually give fuck - vote!

Oh, keep ""sense community"" shit for...well, immediate physical community people realistically held accountable. God help poor suckers actually believe people care others they'll never actually meet real life!

Kindest regards,

P.S. Dont forget vote me!  Unpopular opinion American population disadvantaged, future, utterly hopeless. simply care. that's top hyper individualism. also say obsessive masker borderline hermit point absolutely understand need staying home, etc. life shit care dying, rich fuck think world pleasure, nothing matters. Show sources claims preventative measures taken killing virus itself... Really doubt anything back up. fine. need people. mean technically they're great business paying 300% markup product available grocery store.

so maybe need beginning look lot like PLAGUE! Makes glad live Australia. hoping natural selection. Looks like shut down. Eh, could use culling keep saying it, everyone whatever fuck want pandemic aint nobody going choices next one. one enforced extreme prejudice. Well reply removed purely political which, frankly, think ridiculous given said context. So, herein repost redacting reference particular color. Fair enough. test either. point anecdotally - even [location less testing locations] - complete testing. IMHO, pretty crazy really want data.  don‚Äôt understand point lockdown don‚Äôt faith logic prevail. 

They wouldn‚Äôt even necessary people would follow basic instructions yet 250k+ new cases every day. Yeah would want move Texas.

Poor governance worth it. late teens 20s, think live forever. remember. age, pandemic either.

Glad hear Wharf Ft. Lauderdale closed, even though reopened two days. Perhaps near future consistent guidelines (and/or laws) regarding COVID-19 disaster. expect post commonplace soon. feel guilty gathering': 15 members Arlington family got COVID family party*   Chinese Land Reform

you mean mass murder? I've hit 170 going hard 9% grade bike. I'm 65 pretty much heart has. Meanwhile here's current list US states, ranked per capita Northeast states still top, many states moving fast (go North/South Dakota!). interesting see looks like month now. checkpoints right?! One things complicated picture place ethnically uigher, least definitely non han chinese guard standing crisp black uniform mirrored silver aviators looking like cool side authoritarianism.

And mean yeah, they've partially admitted international pressure. 2015 already closed cities. admitting shit back then. boring

You mean smart. better place shit lungs floating sea? You‚Äôre retarded. vaccines gone much make sure viable help country. Trump power force vaccine through. Stop spreading fear Yep fucking sucks. ex still Thanksgiving moms dinner anyone outside house, I've tell son he's going stay dad 2 weeks Thanksgiving make sure bringing covid back house. Fucking sucks. get son first Thanksgiving new house bought. real, got lot help whole pandemic, one countries helped citizens most, sure could better americans think money given away like that? hate people get downvoted tell us government help citizens. thyroid problems? There's lot stories re-infections virus mutations we've told everyday New Normal. also told us almost 50% people polled said take vaccine. planning worst case taking another year two, might putting family risk. I'm saying is, nobody knows. could dangerous damaging mental health let guards decided everything going great summer. isn't? They're paying people attend, they're compensating bypass guidelines. aware payment after. Kinda like bars sell PB&amp;J operate restaurants, they're still bars.  That's got (possibly). everything right, except bad day mom visited comfort me, keep mask stop crying, and... rest history. fine though. manner condoms effective used properly, PCR tests. take PCR test day potential exposure, catch exposure. isolated five days taking PCR test, then, no, 30% false negative rate.  Except Greece already established 300 Mobile Emergency Units today tackle growing number patients need intensive care. though? Lololol
I dont think vaccine supposed give disease supposed prevent. 
Its extremely relevant. actually fan-made Fallout 4 story expansion mod works, speak, called [Fallout Louisiana. People selfish

You've spelled ""freedom"" wrong. /s LGBT people stopped family Thanksgivings years ago: like born  numbers may inflated college students going home semester. Many schools flipping virtual Thanksgiving. numbers disturbing might factors leisure travel. Try dick bitten alligator Seriously. goal stay 140 bpm triathlon. woman's body fighting lying there. terrifying. still know long term effects.  


I hope makes it, hopefully story reaches people.... we've seeing since beginning. stupid. people blame explosion new infections. 18-49 year old demographic 50% total infections reported...and people sere sick enough able get tested. Many symptomatic individuals age group, largest majority bar patrons, recklessly spreading virus everywhere go.

We really need kind enforceable mandate close types businesses tight going flagrantly ignore well-being communities.

Many younger people traveling visit family members Thanksgiving...only days exposed risky behavior.

Unfortunately likely nasty 
‚ÄúChristmas gift‚Äù year. Christmas, I‚Äôm concerned may see exponentially higher infection rate...just time many people ignore health officials gather Christmas!

I hope wrong, I‚Äôm afraid won‚Äôt be. things happen believe well may, see extremely unfortunate days ahead move New Year. many people commented hope 2021 ‚Äúbetter year‚Äù...and among us would argue that? just,turning page calendar going eradicate virus. take cooperation simply we,are,going successful.

In meantime, us paying attention recommendations health professionals continue lives disrupted as,we avoid social gatherings go necessary! rest country - well sadly, people get sick hardest hit among die! Oh good know one assholes emptying shelves reason That's Dr Atlas saying. idiot! thought mantra trump rushing fast? it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt pushing enough? Trump definitely pushing vaccine. whole press conference week ago. general public need pay individual vaccine? guys probably fucked what? Yea, 0.1% chance survival rate they‚Äôll still get sick fill hospital beds already scarce hospital workers busting asses people stupid, find back beds. grandmother died covid days ago Feel free stay inside rest life. nasty virus kind rhetoric weakens position people trying careful aligned actual severity situation. people hear opinions like reality situation much less serious, won‚Äôt believe people telling it‚Äôs serious all. Greece development n creating new ICU bed rather fast year.

And whole Europe second phase, since Greece went full Lockdown less first wave. Greece rapidly creating new spaces.

They established 300 new ***Mobile Emergency Units.*** 

Greece far tackling pandemic rather well. things considered. still pandemic fucks country. wanted let know alone. optimism faith humanity shattered COVID. special type evil pull kind shit. folks kept denying 9/11 first responders benefits  always bring individuals like Jeff Bezos incredible breadth wealth, get money taxing people like him.

The entire net worth billionaires USA $3.2 trillion. federal budget 2019 $4.4 trillion. able seize 100% billionaire's assets able somehow sell assets face value without tanking prevailing price stock/property, able fund federal government time September. Vaccine ‚Äûpill form‚Äú ü§¶üèªü§£ take granted 1/3 people morons. different systems different effects lingering idiocy. places, dumb people follow better crowd, whole system sort works.

And cultures ~~freedom~~ stupid selfishness, everyone thinks they've figured everything out. think worse? Partying bar maskless, going riot mask? Dumbasses  I‚Äôm saying disgusting part opinion. It‚Äôs fact virus started China China tried cover up. doubt Wikipedia? don‚Äôt try edit Wikipedia article sources then. didn‚Äôt give everyone gap year? seemed obvious me, back February March. thought would NEVER open universities high schools year. dumbassery. stopped going convenient supermarket protocol shit show back April/May. literally never happen. cant check vaccination fucking grocery store. point start suing people negligent? stayed awake biology class, kid. fact spread virus others despite vaccinated. known fact still see measles whooping cough communities high vaccination rate. google California, New York, Colorado anti-vaxx see yourself. data there. Unless 95% population vaccinated, thus achieved herd immunity, weakest unvaccinated still contract illness. 

It mechanically impossible 700 million doses administered once, poster correct. people unprotected COVID-19 *can* *will* exposed immune. actually thinking countries get priority others mad. 

As american, ever interacted us? course US going try get fair share, pretty much basis entire society.

I agree madness, almost guarantee US going try. well, plenty us cracked empathy  Less 1% death rate, won‚Äôt happen. Church missionaries used open hospitals poor places none, hospitals actual doctors used real medical science time. churches give medical science? Big hug, stay sane, keep marbles Oh love of...

The point is. I‚Äôve learned live good bad times.  

I understand struggle. 

I understand wanting get bed. Letting house go crap feel nothing matters. dealing alarm bells follow know you‚Äôre normal thinking process isn‚Äôt right. Florida Florida'ing COVID again, could guessed? 1.	NO MATTER SHIT GIVERNMENT IS, STILL GO THINGS LIKE DAMN FAULT New Zealand eliminated came back possibly packaged goods? certain determined cause. state NSW got 13 days free came back via quarantine escape Victoria. lack arable land? I‚Äôve heard lot China‚Äôs domestic food woes lately? articles I've read, seen one federal government said could get vaccine shipments 2020. term I've seen thrown around first quarter 2021, could mean January March.

So way, Health Canada knows urgency like countries? Oddly enough first submit vaccine approval didn‚Äôt take single cent. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Based current outbreak levels, size planes, case statistically, there's 99% chance someone given commercial flight currently infected COVID? Operation Warp Speed Trump thing, right? sure trust information. know say mixed feelings

 one side harmful block access online courses, another side- pass test others? jokes according statistics ""Thin Blue Line""-snorting

fantastic Racism good look. lockdown protesters seem careful.  So, exactly happens staff left take care another bed someone comes bad car wreck? another 10 Covid patients? Especially people need intensive care? They‚Äôve ban foreign journos since 2010 so. There‚Äôs great deal unrest centuries. say that. Federal government suggesting January. Canada likely begin receiving doses anyway, there's probably less rush US UK better supply. makes feel normal introvert friend pregnant hooking throughout pandemic says tired hearing politics. love government can‚Äôt fight virus they‚Äôre busy fighting Democracy. He'll probably encourage cult minions take whichever vaccine financial interest in. normal cremation costs 6500 NYC? literally cannot even afford burned alive/dead there. I‚Äôm Australia mass shootings Port Arthur massacre government banned lot guns put restrictions sales others haven‚Äôt massacre since 1996 

Giving rights willingingly tragedy something worth bragging about. anything lesson react. It‚Äôs important distinction though, lot people believing outbreaks super reckless. Don‚Äôt black white judgment. important story share  right insurance. (they're network), year cost $36, really 31 consider got back $5 coupon. agree conceptually wish could work. 

But many people bar photo probably work nurses, physical therapists, delivery people, cleaning staff, grocery clerks etc. 

If could easily sequester old people (or high risk people) literally dont interact anyone else , idea could work.

Unfortunately that‚Äôs impossible. Without rights trampled on. know Florida feels that.... lot places called Arlington. Apparently there's one Texas. know. Narrow skimming Title. The¬†coronavirus pandemic¬†has brought¬†hunger¬†to millions people around world. National lockdowns social distancing measures drying work incomes, likely disrupt agricultural production supply routes ‚Äî leaving millions worry get enough eat. They're people querdenk.

Or wait, maybe they're people ***from*** Querdenk? Keep mind too; distribution vaccinated people even. Areas well well national average. bars closed are? everything wide open. Toothless local mask mandate, screwed here. infuriating, insisting traveling, entitlement. coming (pre-covid) frequent traveler. get it. number important. What's important mid December tens hundred cities look like Bergamo worst state. make sure need hospital next two months. gotta gotta do, Joel speak show breaker basement, ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù, husband wearing mask repair guy not. Husband come upstairs repair guy worked dishwasher wasn‚Äôt around 5 mins contact I‚Äôm still unsettled unmasked stranger home 50 mins. Also- disinfected surfaces repair guy touched. nothing lives actually matters. control feel superior general public, feeling like they're part group.

It's reason lot people comment reddit. Yep Yes, odds much higher inside family friends sharing meal. Keep real, man. Even show, isn‚Äôt worth it? He‚Äôs sending message people don‚Äôt know whether he‚Äôs immune not. Keeping schools open food child care it‚Äôs essential doesn‚Äôt negate amount exposure, much more, gym, bar, hospital. Exposing children, families, educators virus schools essential, non-negotiable. Bless you. think I'm sadist keep trying point people social media simply telling everyone cancel social contact spring 2021 disingenuous approach lacks nuance good way make people say fuck everything power proverbially piss solid advice. get barrage downvotes angry messages, yet keep choosing engage. don‚Äôt one.

This tragic inevitable reality failed leadership pandemic. health system inexorably collapses community spread managed. Online ordering great option shopping near closing/after 8pm weekday. Particularly really busy places like costco Thanks! Fuck world charge become entitled, making real people miss grrrr! spate UK. Cretins. Hmm. Potential slogan? ‚ÄúKeep Texas red. Wear mask.‚Äù rather predictable' would better headline methinks. Can't order groceries delivered house? I'd respectfully disagree say one human being's personal choice. somehow equate anyone supports women's right chose slavery mental, can't possibly expect anyone listen say going jump ridiculous hyperbole.  seems contingent people love this. mean love it. husband home quarantine see parents next week same. tests scheduled well Monday. don‚Äôt see risk way. knowingly part ideologies clash.

Having unprotected sex know whether AIDS illegal, knowingly passing AIDS sexual partner illegal.

It's principle COVID: tested positive illegal socialize w/o mask. know whether not, illegal socialize w/o mask.

If strongly believe Governments punish know still socialize w/o mask must also strongly believe Governments punish unprotected sex. know. sucks. pandemic taught three favorite things indoor dining, non-essential shopping, touching face. tossed salads? Thanks, appreciate you! I'm not. mean wish was, know... know general public part.

Just seems like Trump cultists ignoring point. Pretty hard ignore numbers recently. ? 100%. horrible! individuals sacrificing liberty freedom comfort help society? must crazy believe anyone would that, stupid sheep, useful idiot chinese russiian bot! Obviously totalitarian opressive government hiding millions death, chinese people work governnment never post video pic actual pandemic china cause would shame china would never hurt society...oh wait Project much? \- Economy-crippiling lockdowns

\- Small businesses closing

\- People like Pelosi Newsom following rules

\- Panic instilled media

\- entirely different thing (BLM) overtaking covid midway through, completely smashing restrictions process, yet somehow okay

\- Media whining people seeing families going outside

\- blame unfairly placed one person

\- People freaking someone pulling mask two seconds That's handy way explaining it, get particular source could send me? name checks  Thanks - I'm confident memories pandemic. always makes feel better. acting. Observing behaviors eyes. must live area much higher level median education levels do.  Also, since already it, mind waiting line vaccine 

Why would people who've recovered Covid need vaccinated? good would do? good question. parents, already COVID bubble think good. course that's also sides taking precautions flying anywhere. gotta a: make long, b: lose job (as engineer, lol) meantime. one time tax mega rich pay massive bonus every nurse worked covid patients, pro-rated progressively long (meaning get much longer). 

I'd love see republicans vote this. mean, probably still will. Seroprevalence studies areas went unchecked showed burnt around 67% population. like want told something. rebel whatever authority saying something want hear. Glad hear it! see people literally remove mask caugh sneeze. zero hope us. Masks lockdowns do. could Biden let happen! /s mean, ‚ÄúYou must starve death nurses doctors‚Äù really winning message? Probably not. 

The issue shutdowns push people poverty death. 

The issue people want starve death lose everything. 

You aren‚Äôt going pep talk sacrificing lockdowns. Love kindness. Doesn‚Äôt exponential growth mean amount infected goes exponentially? 100 people today would 10,000 tomorrow 100,000,000 next day? ain't gonna happen Agreed. constant refrain. thought shocked people anymore, depth people's selfishness guise ""freedom"" something could never imagined five years ago. Okay, fat people? awful lot US. say fat person myself. would maintain China middle class residents USA citizens. 

In regard, shift already occurred. stock market artificially boosted - economy all. You‚Äôre pro-life, you‚Äôre pro-birth. Looks bad right. clarifying stance, respect position. There‚Äôs nothing prove ignorant people. 
I already know enough one comment kind bimbo I‚Äôm dealing with. feels like US hates doctors nurses Oh hang there. tough ride we're on, we're together get side. least us...  nurse, orderly staff would prefer put risk catching covid employer forcing ill people whilst working...  They‚Äôre gonna approved emergency use end phase 3 trial way drugs vaccines would be. situation bit different though I‚Äôd certainly still first line access first doses. 10-percent confirmed PCR test. people multiplier actual infection rate somewhere 3 8 depending upon test surveillance quantity, percent positive, factors. SD probably closer 40% population infected. actually abstinence based corona education.

""Just tested self isolate mean go others!"" ""Those contraceptives work effectively even try sex use them!""

People say ""ah work inconveniences me?"" Guess wont A) people feel need get tested, even symptoms 

b) people anything get results

c) people believe results

d) people employers realize need quarantine, positive

e) yolo states. feels like full decade ago.

It does...and still scared shitless. Countries trying hard find way destabilise usa, know. Dude fuck Yes. Ah, finally! Something made smile. exactly would say, too, implanting chips people. Highway hell capitalism. 

something deeper going on.

Australia NZ pretty social democracies right thing - Sweden social democracy wrong things. admit single ruling party able quickly effectively deal pandemic major plus.

Imagine single party's head Trump. China would royally fucked. So, nope. It‚Äôs helping celebrities politicians seeming socialize (even it‚Äôs work) claiming it‚Äôs safe testing time. see people appear functioning normally precautions, it‚Äôs reasonable assume would true anyone. Monday night rehabilitation style Yes...which um. they‚Äôre going review data, right? get downvoted saying experts endorsing it? didn‚Äôt lie anywhere government welds doors apartment buildings! Magafucked? going grocery store essential places still get it.

Thank Instacart deal that. mom taking vitamin supplements since start pandemic

She got physical blood test revealed low vitamin d

Make sure supplements take good ones also make sure body absorbs vitamin efficiently Yeah, science. stimulus package coming months. think, perhaps, don‚Äôt know great example problem. everyone. look around. plenty countries right. saw news report Atlanta airport NBC. Every person interviewed mask nose. strategic edit let people know stupid travelers are.... Yes, unfortunately it‚Äôs somewhat catch-22. drugs expensive dangerous way. protective effects (if indeed any) might due drug level blood crohns patients first infected COVID. 

Either way don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs possible treat general pop stuff. dose costs 18k every 8 weeks. requires doctor nurse supervision infusion. take meds prevent allergic reaction. Cancer risks small exist. Heart, liver kidney side effects possible. Maybe one dose fine, maybe triggers auto-immune disease. 

So basically.. save treatment need late? treat everyone first become positive even feasible? afford that, many would suffer serious side effects could ultimately mild case COVID. 

In IBD land talk risks vs rewards biologics lot. risks dangers unchecked IBD much MUCH worse remicade. Suppressing immune system obviously consequences unchecked auto immune disorder ravage body (and cause cancer itself). goal always avoid delay surgery steroids, biologics help minor cost. 

But COVID.. knows. don‚Äôt know compare risks like IBD. It‚Äôs much tougher decision. people year die flu!

Thought number even lower: 34,000 Prove it. I'm British-Australian BTW. fun living parents basement next decade Yeah. Diabetes Belt soon renamed Surveillance Belt. Fucked! Nah definitely embargoed oil steel sales axis.

We however sell FUCKLOAD STUFF lease Russians. Like... several million pairs boots. thousand tanks, airplanes, etc. don‚Äôt disagree. however think would place enough care themselves. least us mentally prepared it.

Gonna long winter Ok please? whole family--all 5 us house--caught COVID. us mild and/or asymptomatic cases. tested positive 11/3 amd cleared go back work/school past Monday. four people state want come visit. None COVID.  think danger catching based folks seem immunity least while. 

How risk though, drive straight hole house week? state (Iowa) absolutely batshit cases right now.  gotten swabbed get results Monday leave drive here.  also coming areas heavy cases. worried family much worried them. already told come going ANYTHING.  well stocked food games go anywhere walk dogs. Good luck everyone, you‚Äôre going need it

-Someone Australia Honestly everyone distanced wearing masks, odds getting grocery store fairly low. Much, much higher indoor gathering, sharing meal distancing. Oh no, kill grandma... must stay inside forever, living life killing people. reason covid spreading. god I'm glad general population share opinion reddit. 
 pretty obvious whole avoid people stay inside thing fucking work. get water guys high horses they're locked inside? Taiwan would greater world recognition agreements countries would create liberal flow increasing international visitors workers like Australia well incorporate issues, would make existing covid-19 figures highly unrealistic towards numbers Australia would given population. Unlike US, UK several countries, Australia took covid-19 seriously implement stringent rules early enough prevent 907 deaths could easily avoided. 100 deaths quite time virus became politicised. Tuesday definitely slowest day store work at. Tuesday time past 7:00 may well place unless there's crazy ad. Completely disagree. fatigued copping take.

The people dying ones deserving confront need short term satisfaction outweighing death others

This virus exposes human condition ""kicking social problem road"" - similar attitude german citizens 30s 40s

It's ageless, timeless human flaw: fact thankless hard empathetic self-serving still getting ones needs met.

Another one sniffing nose, allegedly exempt wearing mask, wiped nose finger proceeded pick put several items settling smoked salmon. gave fish miss day buy groceries online often can. issue trump competent leader took seriously, people sides aisle would take seriously. 

Trump's lack leadership leads people denying virus, also apathy among many others. There‚Äôs way we‚Äôre going lockdown right? Fucking thank you. real Anyone know lab affordable antibody test? insurance cover unless medically necessary (which isn't, case). switch person positivity test positivity? I‚Äôve seen several states start lately, like Wisconsin Illinois. Happens viruses low rate Assuming that's true, everyone got sick today need vaccinated vaccines widely distributed several months. Instacart, initially give high tip order likely immediately picked up. get food, you‚Äôre allowed go back app change high tip lower tip (even $0). reasoning functionality, guess, could bad service lower tip good service give tip. yeah. Really terrible people that.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs do? little shit.‚Äù done re: metabolic health know democracies USA ?? Canada, France , uk

Now we're here. virtually guarantees Christmas see absolute explosion cases month lag January likely see deaths, possibly 3,000 day. 

It's going brutal months. wonder holiday going impact reporting? think masks oppression people seem think governments using virus excuse grasp power. way ever government said ""we gained much power, let's return power gained back people""? It‚Äôs weird experience something huge part human history. knowing descendants al thinking thing ‚Äúwhy fucking dumb?‚Äù 

Honestly, public view health look pretty similar people believed Plague Doctors bird masks Bubonic Plague. We‚Äôve sent men moon, many areas humans depressingly similar 400 damn years  course traveled countries - think spread ?????? would felt welded apartment Trump's order... I'm guess may something negative say... used think easy game modifiers Plague Inc joke. realize reality. think comment person, thing. pulled kid March 15th definitely fair-share TP hand. 

Things going pretty well us though, considering circumstances. prepared understood going March, assume probably smart enough still average. loved show!!!! can't traveling holidays year, wearing masks, hosting large gatherings.

We cannot allow medical services strained like this.

You know fucking problem, Medceines sans frontieres sent grand ol' USofA abuse putting medical community.

Wear mask. Social distance. Think countless people know, selfish actions lead someone else getting sick. check sub often... post Gates always upvoted front page. mean, that‚Äôs country started... Military, sports teams, medical industry, hopefully long things like retail, food service, public facing workers.  live Los Angeles testing sites everywhere, little waiting line, results back anywhere 1 hour 36 hours. Yeah shit. way framing it, rare occurrence community spread. still get grocery store. am. math. dangerous 50 without pre existing conditions. downvote delete comments fucking true. lockdowns hurting helping point. coronavirus never eliminated. could achieve herd immunity (this strategy outcome infectuous diseases) faster healthy people got virus became immune( reinfections extremely unlikely exception) . Lol. Like American passport worth anything right us modern plague pit. world closed American travelers.   sound like great person. Yeah I‚Äôm strategic planning next year leader nonprofit it‚Äôs painful making plans optimistic based best case scenarios next several months. don‚Äôt want give apathy really feasible assume things may better spring? Entitled US currency encapsulates everything wrong. Infinity butt fucked isn‚Äôt lot evidence mother-to-fetus transfer virus, however, read placental damage mom gets sick it. see that, sure. like office operated past 5 months so, maintain 50% office capacity staggered days office remote working. 

For example, work 3 days in, 2 home start next week 3 home 2 office. nice compromise bustle interaction office quiet uninterrupted flow working remotely (i.e. fewer phone calls, walk ups, etc). understand, blame Trump! One million travelled Friday Thanksgiving American airports. CDC estimates 50 million Americans travel Thanksgiving total.  

Wuhan spread virus around world 5 million Chinese New Years.

We doomed. 4-6k per day dying Xmas possible. Ex nurse traveling like nothing going on. us, 10 people two households. already bubble together anyway, quarantine pretty efficiently outside that. One person still goes grocery stores instead delivery, that's it. lot families, 10 people really many. Thats collectively we're maroons. like we're even anywhere close diagnosing actual amount cases anyways. Numbers probably 5x higher confirmed cases say. Gates Foundation incidentally funds lot global healthcare research whole US Federal government. would know things healthcare. Yes did, don‚Äôt admit reality I've biggest D-word rhymes Loomer, sub way much. partner going book tickets Japan next week June.

At least US Europe, vaccine coming. December going bad, really bad, we're almost out..... would think night clubs would one worst - people tits party drugs packed dance floor hours. tell Biden street celebrations last week. Yet ex NICU nurse traveling like nothing ever happening.... Free speech != Free election. means corporate propaganda, fake news, foreign interference politicians sale Murdoch. problems US democracy. Singapore stract fact-based media, international news channel, ChannelNewsAsia best awards strict laws fake news mean elections fact-based, politicians stressing policy making shit dissing opponents. also means suffer team vs team syndrome plagues US democracy. young youngest trial participant?

Insanity. hope nurses US forgive guys...  Unless something trial data don‚Äôt like would expect Moderna Pfizer receive decision amazing ancestors 100 years ago made much sense. Human beings race get much dumber? believe 5 million people left Wuhan Chinese New year, still strict lockdown time. capitalists forcing people offices 8 hours minimum. Nah, fine go statistics.

Jesus Christ. No, guidelines - literally since _April_ - indicate asymptomatic people _may_ spread Covid.

The caveat deeply, deeply unlikely, especially compared symptomatic patient.

This based actual case studies Singapore, nothing come since really disprove guidance. Wuhan proof asymptomatic spread unlikely, still cannot ruled out.

This countries sensible Covid policies limited resources focus effort symptomatic patients - especially potential super spreaders. ironically due anticollectivist society understand mean it‚Äôs really possible free elections without free speech. don‚Äôt believe independent media outside Singapore would agree you.

Thanks! husband COVID nurse it‚Äôs shocking often gets told ‚Äúit‚Äôs hoax‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs real, test again‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre liar‚Äù literally full PPE suit trying save lives. patients family great quantity patients family berate COVID staff ridiculous.  sure facetious husband flew help mom severe medical emergency literally family friends. We're traveling thanksgiving though Covid-19 comparable SARS/swine flu - way infectious despite virus family. 

‚ÄòTaking chances fun‚Äô kill million people. health care system overwhelmed numerous areas cases continue increase exponentially. Without care fatality rates Italy spring closer 3-4%, rather 1%(ish) we‚Äôve we‚Äôve got better treatments. Even Phizer Moderna vaccines approved next 2 weeks still take months get even half population vaccinated. 

Lets see... first 5 months virus US: 100k known covid deaths. Second 5 months: additional 150k. fast infection rates spiking I‚Äôm hoping next 5 months additional 225k, fear 300k deaths time period. already know oct 1 we‚Äôre averaging 1 extra death tied covid every 2 known covid. Thats less 1/3rd US population catching wild. read article? Sure, walk past someone grocery aisle it, less likely get grand nephew picked class shows house sits talking 6 hours Thursday afternoon.

Why hard understand? Even pre pandemic, would go Costco mostly close closing time. Fewer people, fast, lines. Major downside never catch free samples. article makes think conversation recently someone gone medical leave work pay due COVID concerns. person respiratory issues considered high-risk. said ‚Äúlook, don‚Äôt really think die virus. think got it, there‚Äôs real good chance would wind hospital. go hospital, bankrupt. don‚Äôt go work, bankrupt. would rather bankrupt healthy bankrupt sick.‚Äù

My guess lot people thinking along lines hunkering down, really participating economy all. won‚Äôt come feel safe. Apparently. Thanksgiving. ‚Äòancient‚Äô 244 year old ritual. important thing right now. 

America less 300 years old. angsty teenager world. 

Get fucking grip!!!  That's quite right. polls saw said 60% people said would take 20% said would not.

Also people lie pollsters themselves. Especially something political. bet 80% people end taking it. many u think inflected COVID‚Äôs birthdays think virus spreading? know virus spreads? think people power (health officials, scientists, doctors) wrong corrupt lying us? 

You think you, close friends/acquaintances followed rules two weeks didn‚Äôt work means doesn‚Äôt work? There‚Äôs scary number people didn‚Äôt - ever. amount people consequences renders anecdotes completely minuscule. 

Yeah, good job us, ‚Äúlot people‚Äù know Facebook read followed rules month doesn‚Äôt mean shit. much larger group never even tried polluted views. basically fuck health care workers well. wish group people would die already. Selfish fucks chance even originate China. We'll wait see.

There's agreement ""asymptomatic"" used refer someone's current status, entire course illness.

You read context determine word used.

A lot misunderstandings -- probably deliberate -- happened scientist used one meaning word (often obvious context meaning used) reported meaning. Sorry seemed like coming you. intent. 

Best wishes stay safe.  Ehh American defined rebellious fuck attitude. 

I think best leader America would still pretty bad. 

If dealing pandemic exam, Trump got solid 0% good leadership we'd best get 20%. 

Slightly worse European countries. People deserve die? Get fucking grip.

Choosing miss that, last holiday season fact last time see loved one, incredibly hard. last time saw grandfather fact last Thanksgiving, lost earlier year due covid. grandmother handling well.

Yet choosing go could thing causes kills (or other) relative.

It's win, shitty situation. go, someone anticipate dying near future, going happen regardless pandemic, missed opportunity final memory; go, potentially kill (or even die yourself) decision. 

This end. Please, everyone begin right things end pandemic starting now. lose to. gets worse continue path we're on. site responsible one accurate models total infections estimated 60 million Enjoy field hospitals amd makeshift morgues, then.

It‚Äôs principle. bag tax, incentive make people act sustainably bring bag. allowed incentivized, still taxed explicitly told wrong. Like, ‚Äúthank obeying covid restrictions. We‚Äôll tax 7 cents following rules‚Äù bad messaging too.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* data refers people currently infected.

Way 2 prevent Colorado/US infected. anti-vax one first get vaccine. 2 current top vaccines new type vaccine. know short term safety. way know bad side effects happen years administration. vaccine rushed get approved risk hopefully worth taking. still risk. Nice try ccp get car, risk run someone cause car accident. Driving poses risk me, passengers everyone else road. think mean potentially exponential impact virus present driving.

From statistical perspective, precaustions outlined, dinner 10 less low risk. Given includes 10 days self isolation vigilent mask wearing, PCR test, probably less risk someone skipping thanks giving, getting tested, continuing grocery shop/etc.

When evaluating risk poses attend around us, fair comparison. Assuming they‚Äôre taking precautions getting tested big deal.   Hmmm. Mixed feelings. Flying special occasion people. get concern. empty seats / places throughout plane? coughing gross?  going lead Christmas healthcare workers previous takes manufacturing relatively easy what‚Äôs hard storing-shipping exc grew military dad see 6m year time. celebrations came back. Holidays dates. Nope, that‚Äôs projection US. 40-60 million actual infections falls line best estimates IFR. Bill stalled congress since July. gonna happen. watched single game year. I'm one viewer getting view year. People dying can't justify watching something could cause spreading deadly virus. meh, think vaccines really like band-aid...there really thing 'immunity' virus, like there's thing immunity flu, flu shot instance lower likelihood get it, STILL get though...gonna thing here, people going around thinking vaccine cure it'll make immune...NOPE, sorry folks, thing immunity, it'll still 30/70 whether get taking ""vaccine""...much better odds, doubt, still band-aid require safety guidelines remain effect quite time come...but nobody wants talk ***that*** they? Covid-19 comparable SARS/swine flu - way infectious despite virus family. 

Covid-19 comparable SARS even though genus? Yeah buddy, that's called mutation. Though, mutation change genetic makeup much longer recognizable SARS, still makes SARS(more specifically mutation labelled ""SARS-cov-2"").

Your quoted statement scientifically inaccurate. problem term, also problem countries studied scientist still calling SARS COVID-19. amount people view issues black white blows away. Various nuances thing many people think nothing. problem since everyone laissez-faire attitudes summer, hard lockdowns required again. stupidity mind boggling. stupid in-laws literally covid, got diagnosis. still about, planning attend big family thanksgiving, love much. gonna love lot less kills one them. Final result: Mass strike healthcare workers. hope. Nope. increase rate people began protesting. I‚Äôm scared return work holidays. coworkers, doctors office less, don‚Äôt give fuck comes travel. I've following Singapore's COVID response since March I've absolutely wowed efficient government's measures been.

I question: gathering restrictions still place, people socializing? people wear masks indoors home family people social bubbles? ever part official advice? I've seen Americans post weird ideas mask-wearing here. Read rights renter state IL. Contact lawyer consultation. Inquire consultation free beforehand. so, talk them. not, contact another law firm. plenty lawyers represent you, pro bono sometimes, case seemingly falls favor. Walmart? bother. people engage kind stuff, people years later cry crocodile tears lie (perhaps even themselves, less) hard them.

People super warped perceptions themselves. endanger countless people actions, pretend never happened, even express awful person would that. flew really bad, esp get one remaining airlines blocking middle seats (SWA, Delta). could also redeye really worried. people good masks airport, stay away bars.

From experienced, likely safer driving 15 hours w/gas food stops overnight stay somewhere. healthcare workers deserve hope every single one walks out. deserve it. seriously want cry right now. stupidity starting get me. idea people dumb. vaccine solve everything Considering 50 million people still traveling obvious many people still traveling. 

The problem ""more local"" gatherings, reason them, multi fold reason recommended celebrate household members year.

You negative one day positive next. essential activity. people going feel pressured go one place next. eating/drinking hard encourage mask use times, hard keep distance eating drinking. can't control extra girlfriend/boyfriend/cousin/aunt/uncle shows up. 

It's hard. skip one holiday year guys. hard I'm glad I'm one feels way. year breaking point what's going much worse. Don‚Äôt listen assholes. Visit dad enjoy life. asshole virus played fair, contagious asymptomatic people. totally fair know something long correct actions learn it. :) Jesus 



Between June 4 June 29th went 25000 cases day 41000. slope climbing July 4th Yeah said last time Connecticut probably next hotspot, weird think Hawaii one states 10% decrease new cases since last week. Let know see Florida starting get worse truly hope healthcare workers stage walkout. country deserves it. That's bummer reality well! got back February office insisted going continue operate usual. would fine werent new age fucking open office concept germs fly EVERYWHERE. Working home love miss coworkers 

I miss playing soccer basketball much. Every passing day financial support relief, old Carlin bit country bought sold long time ago politicians becomes sharper true. They'll say ""This bad, stayed locked forever!"" 

As two choices: mass death year long lockdown. know, that's they're saying already. course be. actual data support 30% simping US right now? don‚Äôt understand increase cases. We‚Äôve mask mandates. go often, see compliance. Shouldn‚Äôt political I've saying years. Dems literally want everyone able maximum liberty whatever want lives...except guns, control tightly make people felons overnight owning inanimate object. Meanwhile that's exact situation we're already regarding drug possession (catch felony owning inanimate object that's harming one) say wrong create felons little. Interesting works things others. easily quarantine better safe sorry. Ruh roh raggy also dont buy argument shrugs covid deaths people who've exceed life expectancy. people dying covid 70s 80s may otherwise lived another decade more. Ironically, even people died national life expectancy, life expectancy would still drop life expectancy distribution which, sense, raised higher people greatly surpass life expectancy. mention number people 70s continue work increasing hence cant discount economic impact losing workers either. Lol Democrats spend 4 years talking Trump Manchurian candidate Putin? That's fear based messaging? No. false. restaurant would easily infected 50 - 80 people. fact infected 4 testament safe airplanes are. zero supply. That‚Äôs problem. people consistently go houses school rotate around closed bubble. reasonably common model lot people right now. often called pods cohorts. 

If real lock would end pandemic much sooner economic impact would less long run. Practically speaking would address economic disparities make happen everyone. one would gladly give stimulus moneys another family could stay home could get faster safely. India one poorly well

Hopefully fellow Americans won‚Äôt get first. world wide, talking infections USA Germany could even effective weather pandemic neighboring nations followed similar protocols.
Sadly, America‚Äôs poor example mixed messages affect many Europeans perceived public health advice. distancing mask mandates accompanied fines, enforced (as countries) would reduced spread.

I don‚Äôt say upset anyone. say (we are) living tiny world. hard empathize understand someone might make choice making travel- end day, actually know little someone making decision so.

I relate kind pissed mention... we're gonna get pumped spicy monkey juice?...

I'm NZ? Aussie, like slowly driving past terrible car accident. watch horror hope best, knowing pointless.

And? experience also. harassed threatened times wearing mask. management stores much help, really enforcing masks. longer pick orders areas. kroger ones worst cat fishing. Yikes. sounds absolutely frustrating. Thanks sharing story though, wish family best. Maybe 100m total? think people referring initial supply, day-0 supply Population 800,000. quite good now, due border travel restrictions early consistent mask mandate. Indoor living cold weather helping. news, minor seems given stories posted every day, lineups stores yesterday, people stocking expected shut-down. Keep mind, that's Nationwide local minima Maxima obscured.

Some states hit testing capacity national numbers look bad. Yes possible. emergency law passed spring would allow close places like malls restaurants. government let expire. compliance unenforceable recommendations bad getting multiple government press conferences week talking much worse is. say don‚Äôt need to. 

Oh, do. They're already facing capacity issues hospitals (not even first time) fraction Europe's cases. again, staunchly keep pretending virus exist, like Japan's since March, sell whatever number point?

My point ""Europe"" ""Asia"" stupid generalizations mean nothing explain even less. Oh, especially bar owners. Scum. Harassing, tax-cheating, customer-cheating, employee-cheating slimy scum. I've known bar owners would even water liquor bottles water add food coloring would look like liquor.

Lockdowns kill people too. suicides, rising unemployment (which know takes away life years), cancer treatment suddenly stop covid important. realise people die TIME right?? heart disease, cancer, car crashes. change dying car crash way higher covid victim, younger age. ban cars? Every life matters right?

How many 40 year old cancer patients would slowly torture death convenience? 

SEE THERE??? Absolutely. get vaccine, I‚Äôll go see movie theatre... movie, don‚Äôt care what. I‚Äôll go dinner nice sit-down restaurant. I‚Äôll go weekend road trip. nerd, I‚Äôll go first sci-fi con happens near me.

 I‚Äôll still wear mask wear possible, others feel comfortable (at least large numbers people get vaccinated). Everybody worried Turkey gatherings. I‚Äôm concerned reunions always take place Wednesday. It‚Äôs probably 4th/5th biggest party day year. New year‚Äôs, Halloween, St. Patty‚Äôs, &amp; Wednesday. family (on dads side) holidays.

I don‚Äôt say upset anyone. say (we are) living tiny world. hard empathize understand someone might make choice making. Especially it‚Äôs inherently irresponsible. time know 20% story, it‚Äôs probably best judge. couple things favor:

And country best fanciest smartest exceptional brilliant medical system pluckiest hardest working people much worse covid.

Delusion, much?

It doesn‚Äôt really matter bunch fancy shit nation state filled horrible people. wish magafucked point pandemic everyone complacent Everyonefucked. liberal buddies beerlympics party last weekend upwards 40ish people. guess celebrate rise cases area? banned travel China United States labeled xenophobic, yet problem calling bans traveling across states. We're fucked husband friend non-masker. died covid last week. actual funeral notice said ""no mask required.  WTF. told hubby goes isolate holidays.  car social club belong 12 13 cases. (2 deaths.)  decided yet canceling Christmas party. tired worrying this. I'm bummed believe right. see Skynet came conclusions did. wonder going that, since needs -70C cooling? commandeer fleet deep cooling trucks containers? hospitals full. got we‚Äôre playing move patients night get icu beds open Sure. clear Im talking authority. 

I live France, another country seems put effort PR effective policy. idea many people parroted mantra, ""We live lives"", tell maybe sightseeing / spending day museum / going Disneyland / making effort self isolate good ideas global pandemic. Ugh idk go parents. Thanksgiving would me, live alone. they're... bubble.  Gotta love fungible currency health minister said get 100 million doses wouldn‚Äôt talk details deal: Wikipedia says likely started processing bats Guano traditional Chinese Medicine. Chinese people ingesting bat poop, that‚Äôs started. Chinese government tried cover found pandemic.

And said done, probably American technology puts end worlds problem. mad? 7am weekend rules live. morons asleep celebrating rage. free. pay huge amount money shot. kind source unilad lol That's cool way think it. please stay home one get sick. need people taking hospital beds stupidity.




























If could agree care people did. people kind hatred towards medical health personnel? Even would strange behaviour given many might meet soon (or perhaps many people waiting line). Ski season open here, constantly mind.

Of myself, want end hospital bunch covid patients. Probably naw, need take easy. Masks certainly help, worn *consistently correctly,* apparently beyond ability Americans do. How? 71 million Americans lived past 4 years still decided Republican way... time wake smell lack healthcare, propaganda, xenophobia year. yet. every government EU. Bulgarian made deal Pfizer 16 million (Since much smaller population). 

That mean one country gets full others wait. orders get fulfilled years come, European union decided let every country get proportion vaccines original order met. Meaning let's say Germany would probably get 1mil first, Bulgaria get something like 100k, etc... front line workers (Doctors, Nurses, Critical patients, whatever countries government decides on) actually thinking countries get priority others mad. treat pandemic.

edit: Also forget Pfizer factories Europe Turkey. stationed Germany. Quit letting airlines make calls. Shut down. New Yorkers least, part, seen firsthand bad things get. You‚Äôll always selfish folks, one denying existence science it. fed unemployment extension runs right Christmas 10s millions americans SOL can't find job then. No, social distancing hardly guessing. It‚Äôs repeated throughout pandemic. bet money it. could avoided least half deaths, too, neighbors could done similar us (maybe except Italy). comparison good. case make epic case-control study aspiring epidemiology PhD students coming years comb data see effects segments population got vaccine versus refused. source? sound plausable Google find decent source. Correct I'm wrong, CDC suggest reopening schools little period run certain virus-denying types packed CDC? remember little period last summer CDC officials saying pretty crazy shit, dangerous shit, people loyal certain somebody packed it. Tested positive yesterday. Hello quarantine. TN, common sense lack of, also blame. RemindMe! 33 days feel like would put undue stress already bad situation: manufacture get 40 million second doses distributed time lead first doses going waste second one given time? Sweden, Florida, Texas started sub's guinea pigs. 
Each place took different approaches people hanging see strategies works.

For awhile people surprised Sweden but, course, even now, game over. 

If better coverage we'd probably following Africa, India, Brazil. Loaded metaphorical bombs ü§£ rhetoric uses corona-sketchers really fun people chime ""hErD iMmUnItY nEvEr sTrAtEgY"", record us not-strategizing: Greatest Fucked Fucks huh peak highes point goes (in difference plateau see germany) title ""may already reached peak"" fine. Depending case count ""lockdown"" lifted might know second wave peak picks back might see new peak (making first peak inflection point). liars morons? üò¨ü§Ø people stop pretending pandemic fatigue isn‚Äôt thing? I‚Äôm sick seeing people shamed anything staying home making essential trips...aggressively quarantining months end bad physical mental health. I'm New Zealand tended inverse relationship education concern virus here. runny nose something concerned cough shortness breath? work homes businesses Texas. always wear masks. YESTERDAY, hired work church. one masks there. (preachers family) walking around talking tomorrow‚Äôs service. Texas doomed.  Australia we've told want jump queue able buy dose available (and approved) vaccine yourself. Australia least Pfizer (assuming passes Phase III) Oxford vaccines initially available options later next year.  close damn airports. sensible thing discourage travel? working SARS vaccine? figured first two vaccines reverse engineering virus attacking part allows vaccine enter cells. 100% agreed. vote together get candidates policies 

That's way democracy works. there's divide 60% 40%, 60 get permanently control 40. wonder there‚Äôs Venn diagram two. !RemindMe least everyone wearing masks take 6 days get 13 mil, probably 5 days 14 mil. rates USA billion cases March!!! 50 million doses includes countries. believe US gets 25, enough 12.5 million people.

Moderna‚Äôs far behind, also 2 dose vaccine. Last heard total possible (not guaranteed) enough vaccine 20 million people Moderna Pfizer US end December. Enough make difference hospital overload since they‚Äôll vaccinate vulnerable elderly healthcare workers first.

But won‚Äôt help much half country gets infected next four weeks idiotic travel group gatherings holidays. already knew going cases winter, like seasonal flu. really news. understand this. people driving pandemic? understand people dying *with* Covid *of* Covid doctors making extra money fraudulently misclassifying deaths Covid. 

Giant /S. Paywall.  supply chain issue much anything. pandemic, toilet paper manufactured business. that's people poop - office.

Overnight changed, supply chain configured wrong. Stock got depleted way replenish demand.

The question is, much change supply chain? People went back office. stayed home. ratio now?

Interestingly, Sam's Club day packs home toilet paper paper towels nearly bare. Boxes commercial toilet paper right next looked untouched. Well least access affordable mental healthcare amirite? would they. Covid ain‚Äôt fault. always you.

My parents generation called us weak, spoke us given series raw deals started right around time lives. Nevermind never deal faced/continue face. they're old dying, they're terrified - still fight us. dismiss us like children. never stopped underestimating us.

Talk someone feel. feel important thing is. Every single one help change world. case: can't lose play! fatality ratio 0.0002 &lt; 49 0.005 &lt; 69's - probably harder pessimistic optimistic honesty. understand sentiment all. plenty free tools available meet virtually. like can't contact family all. 

You miss one year holidays. save lives. Maybe own, maybe neighbor, co worker, parents, people even know. 

Is really hard enough empathy realize slowing spread covid important holidays? really easy trigger people viewpoint except selfish ""me me"" attitude. I‚Äôd personally wear mask bc promotes mask wearing generally public.

This am. probably back March. church initial outbreak spot week initial shutdown started. testing anyone back then. still wear mask, stay home much possible, etc.... encourages behaviors others may vulnerable. county provides free testing city. world fallacy! way. California already banned sale animal furs. make sure none clothing buy made animal parts. rise low-cost synthetic materials, becoming easier easier that.  Cases, cases, cases hear, even though vast majority asymptomatic, therefore truly cases. Imagine last year done mass testing flu. symptoms scratchy throat sniffles? Come get test! single symptom all? Come get test! think able find 100,000 cases US every single day that? Hell, would probably find 200-300k cases day did. Testing covid like testing cold flu virus...except treating ebola, case 50% chance dying. absolutely bizarre thing modern history. policy based this, still talking containment... one mentions pink purple elephant room...that 1. highly contagious, mild respiratory virus. 2. cannot control contain highly contagious mild respiratory virus real significant way. would understood last year...now ""scientists"" magically forgotten. Why? become China's Manchurian candidates, thus brainwashed China's bullshit claim eradicated cold virus lockdowns? dug gigantic hole back March going route lockdowns mass psychosis... see way get still save face, except Orwellian dystopian tactic keeping false narrative long possible? study CDC linked back May going give answer, that's sure.

And might've missed front page yesterday. study think pretty damning evidence mask used eat restaurants like ten times week ball tip high. I‚Äôve gotten takeout 3 times since March One reason small children less likely spread school probably many countries 12 smaller groups mix classes. I've also noticed small children tend really good wearing masks washing hands. need learn new things every day, hygiene rules nothing special them. 100% compliant agree restrictions still find whole situation hard. suffer depression social interaction always good me. hard. But, I‚Äôm everything part solution, problem. But, make mistake, able hug Mom, see Grandmother waning years, real interactions friends loved ones difficult. also lost everything months. I‚Äôve lucky, can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs easy either. Black Friday, cyber monday, boxing week company christmas parties. Wait currently 115,180 cases moment. lot. Anti-Mask people mostly hypocrites selfish bastards. would thought? /s Time really embrace Christmas Cards. Everyone complains it‚Äôs dying tradition anyway True, make really nice carpets. tried here, work. people congregated restaurants. closed restaurants people congregated stores house parties. closed stores banned guests home.  Ugh, ignorant point view. People may seen families long time. havent seen grandparents half year. grandfather cancer anyway. might get another thanksgiving together regardless stupid virus. Lots young rich assholes block access, tell they're allowed, listen. good kids, guess. fact China 86,000 cases less 5,000 deaths country 1.3 billion sound fishy anyone?? Meme I‚Äôve seen times.

Sometimes swabs taken together end different batches test machine. mean much, worry low chance =/= chance.  


what someone farts bell peppers covid? shortages *because of* panic buying. I‚Äôm sure whether Thanos reference (The sentence end) I‚Äôm it. daughter covid mid-March still significant antibodies 6 months later. didnt cost $$, I'd get retested antibodies again.  Frequent testing risk-management strategy. take everybody tests positive circulation put isolation, can't infect anybody anymore. stop people tested got false negatives walking around infectious, *lower* number infectious people even totally eliminate it. us are. may run fever yet. probably back March. ran fever 3-4 hours several days it. felt like dog shit long ran fever. time ran fever already get bed surviving delivery pizza. think majority try right thing, it‚Äôs minority don‚Äôt incredibly vocal oppressed are.

Yep. people internet access ounce media literacy, one use obliviousness excuse. know we‚Äôre pandemic, it‚Äôs responsibility educate listening doctors scientists. course it‚Äôs new. You‚Äôre ridiculous you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs new. 
There never final sars vaccine. disease died vaccine created funding dried never got one. never mrna vaccine before. also new. 

Thousands equal billions. Every vaccine candidate 30,000 volunteers less 6 months. That‚Äôs vs 4 years previous quickest approved vaccine. 

I would love vaccine proven safe. think it‚Äôs probably safe. hasn‚Äôt proven safe say it‚Äôs safe real proof jumping gun. you‚Äôre dealing vaccine 8 billion people taking, need sure ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably safe‚Äù. People haven‚Äôt left houses months done choice. never time hiking outdoors, quick shopping trips, outdoor dining, small distanced gatherings outdoors prohibited months months end. activities shown low risk, especially lower transmission times. Complete long term Isolation never asked expected. Limitations been, limitations loosened tightened based local conditions. one releasing free. partner strike til spring It‚Äôs worth risk. savings take hit I‚Äôm catching covid heard PLAN so, nothing concrete, I'm going go yes.

Part seatbelt law executive order, (not lawyer) seems similar mask  work inpatient pharmacy local hospital tell right maybe 60 people covid.

Resources strained. 

People dropping like flies. 

The hospital run patients....

I‚Äôm Miami. Also normal day day operations hospital. Full day surgery‚Äôs plenty chemotherapy patients. 

No medication shortage...

Now I‚Äôm downplaying what‚Äôs happening stating I‚Äôm seeing every day. LOL. formidable death stare too. Wish managers work would this. intimidate workers fine want to, event customer conflict, like hide.

I admire much. look top post, woke up, lol. Still got enough toilet paper paper towels carry 2021 (mainly acquired started coming back first mad rush). want fR3edOm ! Username checks Individual freedom isn‚Äôt part democracy though right? US get üò£ tractors initially created follow main tractor (with driver). would allow one driver twice much work using called ""follow-me"" technology. driverless tractor would follow lead tractor fields like hired hand would. driverless tractor technologies moved toward autonomy, independent driverless tractor part move increase automation farming.** autonomous technologies currently utilized farming include automatic milking automatic strawberry pickers. manager, cashier. waiting checkout defeats purpose.

Let shop whole time ready leave ask leave? That's dumb. again, manager let's employees handle situations like deserve position power. never let employees handle angry upset customers.  insane? 

No, government full corrupt assholes, guys asking simply happen, matter many times downvote factually correct statement. 

I'd support people staying home bills paid, sadly reality America. Everything expensive. see bill cause paid government. still costs money. case, actually $0 US people well insurance company figures cheaper pay everyone's flu shots long run pay less flu related hospital bills. Thanksgiving favorite time year thanks!

(In seriousness, thanksgiving isn‚Äôt problem, travel is). issue east west thing 

No, absolutely is. Primarily 'The US full ignorant entitled morons' thing.  feeling one way other. understand comment correctly, you‚Äôre lamenting fact people don‚Äôt get travel world house heated pool tennis court? are, always be, ultra-luxuries. think it‚Äôs ‚Äúshame‚Äù average American doesn‚Äôt tennis court home gym, World View pretty sick. seems like you‚Äôre using sort excuse bad behavior... You‚Äôre saying: ‚Äúsince average Americans don‚Äôt get live lavish luxurious lifestyle, can‚Äôt expect stay Red Robin 9 months‚Äù.

You‚Äôre point absurd. Sustaining life cost inhumane. Fewer people thriving better people existing suffering. 800 million people abject poverty good thing...but somehow think is.  hope last party lives memorable one. hope immunity lasts freaking eons. 


On agree real shame number people lack empathy able come conclusions without experience first-hand first. Never got flu shot I've never gotten flu. I'm planning get covid vaccine either. nothing Bill Gates, want it. work people actually it, *everyone*. virus isn‚Äôt magical. can‚Äôt survive week two without new human hosts spread to.

If lockdown universal, enforced properly, works (see: Australia, NZ). it‚Äôs chaotic piecemeal approach whole load exceptions exemptions, isn‚Äôt actually enforced properly, yeah it‚Äôs useless. got really cool Dita Von Teese masks. actually really like wearing it. gets colder MI, warm mask sorta nice. 


Oh, don‚Äôt want get sick get anyone else sick. Also that. post plain truth, get downvoted. least give try mention White House. Convenient. First one huh ? What. A. Coincidence. course Yes... they‚Äôre actually taking seriously need better tests. Iran 44,000 death covid, health minister fk'd months ago. Rebab facility friend. Rapid tests daily Doctors nurses follow guidelines still get infected. guidelines help guarantee, ever. really want low possible chance, would drive. Flying, even done perfectly, still much higher risk. Well, soon one living one world, there's that. Yelp similar, would give bad review call company complain. we'll comply. live. sound like wild assumption March 8 -- could predicted country would go 9 months restrictions, quarantines, widespread mask usage? would vaccines record-breaking time? 

If gone varying degrees lockdown, looking another year virus, 70-150 million infected sounds right. not, part party shows primaries *pissed* admitting Coronavirus thing bare minimum back March/April.

He obviously eyes future national stage, able get loses primary. wish someone would break amount pretending COVID exist make fucking morons mad right thing long time ago. Contact tracer California here.

I'm speaking county, offering insight someone trained conversations people. regularly help people figure safest way balance risk circumstances health dept recognizes people's lives one-size-fits-all.

#Best Option

Use remote video stay touch throughout day (Zoom, Facetime, Google Hangout, Whereby, etc).

I know same, many positive cases exposed contacts talk tell really helps. There's something seeing person's eyes smile (and seeing react real time) significantly mitigates loneliness depression come isolation lockdowns. Even contact tracers know live alone starting regular video chats *with other* days connection.

That said, place say that's enough situation. So...

#Next-Best Option

Quarantine. Remember:

-	A negative test mean either coronavirus-free. infected test miss virus reproduced enough detectable level. Even person tests positive, reliable tests (PCR) work replicating virus material days get detectable level.
-	It take two weeks infection result symptoms, infectious even never see symptoms. Sit calendar figure last interacted people. Assume infected date, calculate dad, within six feet two weeks whichever date later.
-	Wear masks time room past two week period. Remember masks eliminate risk. *reduce* risk significantly, zero. cumulatively spent 15 minutes within 6 feet other, even masks, considered exposed. CDC says 15 minute limit resets every 24 hours, health department recently changed guidance reason believe reset. could get minor infection today struggles take hold, exposed infected person day later could give minor infection boost needs turn tide spread. I'm providing guidelines consider make best decision family.
-	Your dad probably stop gas somewhere way Baltimore. wear mask thoroughly clean hands hand sanitizer operating pump. Eating home packing lunch probably preferable stopping food minimize interactions public. That‚Äôs dead point. 

That rhetoric purely politically motivated. serious scientific expert actually believed that. fact, first article ever read first week ‚Äútwo week‚Äù quarantine pandemic scenario pandemic trajectory could last years without intervention. science clear, cut dry start. people field change opinions projections presented new information. That‚Äôs terrifying. can‚Äôt properly plan response without reliable accurate data. comply lockdown. Melbourne Australia, stayed fully locked down, obeyed govt police, 112 days, think was.

Don't worry, moment get another case they'll lock another 112 days. ‚ÄúPermanently cured,‚Äù mean immune? Don‚Äôt count it. Sweden tried herd strategy failed. taking proper precautions. need vaccine. Nah, mum killed previous pandemic 60-odd years ago. recommend. definitely Western countries getting deaths per million, got thought LAX fly internationally. fly work stay there, highly doubt people saw flying work, too. putting restrictions sane people getting scared

But people running money, stimulus horizon. sane people feel need go back work. ... repeatedly chose work jobs expressly forbidden take.

Locking jail might better option.

Tbf, case, govt done help pay losses needing take less lucrative work. Telling someone live abject poverty really sustainable decision. That's restaurants lobby receive restrictive health codes preclude street food taking off. Look see much money costs street vendor NYC: license literally 6 figures. comply lockdown. Melbourne Australia, stayed fully locked down, obeyed govt police, 112 days, think was.

It worked. single positive test covid death, 23 days now. lockdown lifted, masks longer needed outside.

We complied, won.

Stay way virus, individual. Thanksgiving. Thats kills me. took Epidemiology Spring, textbook says over, outbreaks certain viruses pathogens, novel ones- wear mask, social distance, close stuff necessary. Book written 2014, obviously shit standard 100 years.


Yet, entitled people think completely unheard 1984. Fucking morons. ignorance stance. dude 'cough snot... ...all day work', mask no, need see doctor.  I'm Canadian Thanksgiving too, October. nearly big deal US. 
Usually there's big turkey dinner, that's far goes. someone can't make it, one makes big deal it. I'm curious talks kinds masks worn long taken food beverage. believe requiring N95 masks air travel... Maybe next wave hits us SNL audience? watched want hear jokes related pandemic, wow expect they'd audience. Good. I'm tired seeing stupid ""meme"" everywhere. unrealistic lockdown makes snowflake huh? Keep hiding bed scarywery virus. Trump followers definitely dumbest US population, says vaccine ok drink kool aid First off: [the actual research indicates spread SARS-CoV-2 started italy, started September 2019. September 2019 simply earliest samples set, virus detected outset.

What likely means SARS-CoV-2 circulation potentially across wide area significantly longer Wuhan turned initial detected outbreak zone virus.

If ask me, seems virus around well Wuhan outbreak, testing stored samples previously-unknown community acquired pneumonia prior September 2019 probably required specific.

That seems logical, viruses appear suddenly cause large scale outbreaks -- especially viruses largely asymptomatic mild cases like one. takes correct conditions bit luck large-scale outbreak foment existence. feel much. I‚Äôve super worried We'll need far 6 months, since even able vaccine everyone time period.

But person vaccinated help slow would least slow it. also get soon test negative it. Russia part Asia, Europe WELL DONE! Yeah 0.1% population dying really gonna dramatic demographic shift... called battery, might want educate Think this, 2000 Americans going dying Christmas. 

I fucking hate people think covid-19 joke. Good luck family! Yes, there. idea reinforced nearly everywhere American culture. We're society individuals, islands even, wonder we're good collective action necessary. like common sense answers ways get downvoted oblivion. shows elite want think. dont think thats correct. safety employees genuine concern.

sad pickle in. walmart pharmacy area probably putting patients risk enforcing masks. patients already probably list pre existing conditions lol closely following pandemic, know surprise. next months one darkest periods modern human history. everyone computer phone even internet service. better idea limit number people stores one time. 

In state, limits based size store, even width aisles. Go Trader Joe‚Äôs, there‚Äôs always line get smaller bigger grocery stores. 

Masks also required can‚Äôt remember last time saw someone store wearing mask. 

Personally, hate shopping groceries online. given regulations know Covid, I‚Äôm concerned getting sick well-ventilated grocery store multitude social distancing i‚Äôm 20 minutes.  im pretty sure mask mandate San Francisco two weeks stop spread, remember that? we've lied start, would different now?  Suppose rolling corpse semis state yet? whole lot people large gatherings. forty percent people said so. People keep saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine recycled air myth‚Äù ‚Äúthey every seat.‚Äù like pullout method... Sorry. That‚Äôs impinging freedom swing arms wherever feel like. nose there, it‚Äôs damned fault. health doesn‚Äôt trump freedoms. yet we'll get comments deleted specific idiots get drift. 5 millions went around world social distancing. vaccines 4-5 months wide availability general public yet. Don‚Äôt get excited...  shame Reported mods. don‚Äôt allow good news subüò§üò§ King Shrimps right, take account age health involved, total amount covid deaths, also location, ability afford healthcare etc. much likely die accident covid 19. long stick together, ok.

Well nice knowing you. king dropped ~tinfoil hat~ things help protect people. everyone always thinks themselves. That's wrong. misspelled tequila Seriously, even word choice screams ‚Äúmade someone something doesn‚Äôt want pay something.‚Äù I'm puzzled want happen here. Shut downs designed kick road, end pandemic. useful situation afraid hospitals can't keep counter-productive - make pandemic last longer. vaccines coming change situation though; maybe worth kick road allow people time vaccinate. loop hole takes 72 hours get Negative test result Walgreens. take test now, go catch corona 3 days, collect Negative test result board plan actually positive. Yea friend complying 2 hour Covid wait. someone else chipped line SNAP Medicaid offices always long sometime make come back next day.  help receive requires 2/3 hour wait given time I'm gonna go visit family covid March spreader. reason wasn‚Äôt true mandate due horrible legislature thing recently done Ohio‚Äôs governor. quite simple estimate numbers. Yesterday, US hit 200k+ day, took less three weeks cases reached 100k+ day. Christmas due four weeks. virus spread exponentially, doubling stats three weeks based happened yesterday days past.

God forbid, 400k+ new cases 2.5k daily deaths quite likely happen, stay safe. don‚Äôt discount models, beginning exponential growth. I‚Äôm projecting 550k - 600k :( Even countries control that. thought pretty much everywhere implementing this. need another flood trim town idiots

Teton Dam Flood like DJ style over-the-ear headphones. dont even playing anything, enough. felt way back March covid infections US shot past Italy China. told coworker possible way US considered best country world now, we're supposed better this. knew country lacking lot ways, truly believed nation would never let virus get control.

Now know there's large enough chunk country made containment impossible. one result decay we've experienced decades. read different strain. Involved how? rate infection still higher masked counties end timeframe. 

Two counties went 0 cases 1 case timeframe. infinity increase? Whenever we've go Lowe's Home Depot, get opening time, hardly customers, get need, get out. anything else can't easily get curbside pickup. even make sense. can't look TOFI. Thats point. Something like, increasing case numbers make vaccine testing quicker. It'll also reduce demand vaccine, we've simplified distribution process! shit ton people die. insane number people die.

Hopefully enough refrigerated trucks. 

This fear mongering. I've accused that. 

It collapse nurses left travel hospitals need, healthcare workers burned keep going, get sick, nearest available bed states away patients neglected (not heartlessness malice, enough people help them)

Yeah. guys think happens worst case scenario? 

How fucking rapidly approaching that? 

I hear alarm bells, government? easy change mind social welfare programs realize instant: job/industry gone. Maybe child going college. Maybe bought house /started new business put everything it.

Maybe none above, regardless. force pure, unrelenting biology came nowhere pulled rug underneath you; realize things like universal basic income, non premium based Healthcare, basic social service programs shouldnt something wished government stopped trying access too. still don‚Äôt understand people can‚Äôt wear mask, go unless necessary, considerate.

But realize wrong is. kind panic porn 

While 135 million people faced acute food insecurity COVID-19, number expected almost double year, 270 million people. World Bank expects number people extreme poverty rise first time since 1990s.

Please, tell more. 60 Minutes interview, said FedEx UPS handling delivery. Military built brand new software track vaccines track vaccinated when. Pfizer keeps insisting things built supply lines things like dry ice able keep vaccines cold shipping, military keeps claiming part too. Also McKesson lot too.

Brand new software + everyone involved giving different answers = hold breath smooth launch.

I believe confusing things. 

Yes, intense development research going described, still development readily available end user. 

See, education important. one urgent care. get ER, it‚Äôs $2352. also get free CVS. Zuck seriously fucked dude can't imagine dude trying fix issues platforms create. Didn‚Äôt lockdown start 2 weeks ago thought would lot longer considering case numbers still fairly high 
Either everybody preparing vaccine scared lose jobs think deserve credit first one taking extreme measure. Let's honest here, started anywhere else around world, government thought completely cutting traffic 10m people outside. Hell, even never lockdown harsh theirs. 3d printer, look thingiverse account printable mask uses slice surgical mask filter. No, per capita better Europe, despite almsot nothing, that's point. least Santa safe! spirit giving (especially giving Coronavirus) strong American predatory zeitgeist. Interesting giving Americans accessible healthcare always dead water. Many probably never traveled bit told something go travel.  India shit all. probably one highest number deaths world.  Thank you! Halloween? Good point, money election... kids trick treat usually aren‚Äôt standing front person asking candy 15 minutes straight get enough exposure. adults attending party gatherings that‚Äôs different situation. I‚Äôm guessing elections. Either way bad timing super spreaders pandemic 

Thank healthcare worker. Don‚Äôt quit everyone‚Äôs stupidity safe. Extrapolating current numbers exponential progression, nothing done, look 470,000+ deaths end February, 650,000+ mandate easing . 6 months put us May, even giving last month decline allow disparition, 2 months exponential progression last month decline amount roughly 700,000 1M deaths, 1.5M 2M mandate easing. potentially 10 times long-term severe health conditions.

But sure, worth it. covered previously. 

Let ask - think Australia NZ's success 0% geography? 2 countries happen islands population centres miles apart better European nation Accurate vaccines largely prevent transmission, could well eradicate pro-vax countries, leaving small outbreaks anti-vax groups there.

Also, goal aim for: become endemic, make immune-modulating therapies illnesses deadly, perhaps undoing decades medical progress. Number 1 Australian here. reaction Canadian Euro cousins. 

You're fucked head. Really? flew week ago people wearing masks everyone keeping distance. international, still, thought handled rather well. makes nervous bc I‚Äôm required travel holidays Perhaps know they‚Äôre going die covid Romulan approach. like it!  Slovakia Greece dominated first waves. May ask cow? 

There easier solution, use chip instruct mammary glands already house produce milk. Efficient convenient! 'enemy' needs human form obvious enough, we're going deep trouble future. including rent/lease calculation ? Malevolent: showing wish evil others makes nervous bc travel home holidays fucks like 900% casualty rate. great government commits crimes humanity country think heavily affect political opponents?

I hope entire administration spends rest lives behind bars. Pure evil. Wow seems like huge mistake thinking easing restrictions point. Cold flu season coming. Better lock everyone again. See spring. 

## Abstract

The devastating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due SARS-CoV-2, caused 47 million confirmed cases 1.2 million human deaths around globe, severe cases COVID-19 humans associated neurological symptoms anosmia ageusia, uncontrolled inflammatory immune response. Among therapeutic options, use anti-parasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), proposed, given possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Ivermectin positive allosteric modulator alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suggested represent target control Covid-19 infection, potential immunomodulatory activity. assessed effects IVM SARS-CoV-2-intranasally-inoculated golden Syrian hamsters. Even though ivermectin effect viral load, SARS-Cov-2-associated pathology greatly attenuated. IVM sex-dependent compartmentalized immunomodulatory effect, preventing clinical deterioration reducing olfactory deficit infected animals. Importantly, ivermectin dramatically reduced Il-6/Il-10 ratio lung tissue, likely accounts favorable clinical presentation treated animals. data support IVM promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate.  Florida 7 hour wait ER pre pandemic normal. That's messed here. Yeah, know better anyone much coming ;) comparable Asian city. OP talking shit. Cannot work.

Business cannot expand ever decreasing prices human psychology stop spending think money worth money later sitting nothing. Meanwhile people huge cash hoard get real value free coming cash get nothing. Meanwhile never raise prices account quality expansion ""money worth more"" goods services enter neverending death spiral price wars lowest price winning quality service.

Deflation would kill economy civilization. Ben Bernanke protector defender hero civilization know it. Whether want admit not. Within 24 hours surcharges announced, every single electric vehicle, possibly 6 months future, sold. would drastically re-calibrate people's list need every week, it. Mass transit (with COVID exposure issues) might make comeback. freedom jump car/truck go anywhere/anytime what's right what's wrong USA. America bigger better! swathes basically like big Asian cities. 

Not sure drinking truth serum. Small areas Melbourne/Sydney lot Chinese. say large swathes untrue.

&amp;#x200B;

I live Melbourne. culturally Australian far closer America Asia.

And generation two Asian areas like Box Hill/Chatswood Ozzie fuck mine's fourth completely share sentiment Masks cure-all.

Sweden compared directly southern European countries significant differences population density cohabitation patterns, instance. Yeah observations, FAR, say short term immunity still. couple articles change all. That's kind point repeating speculative BS global health crisis!

You're overly hopefully gets people killed. talk unfounded immunity claims people justify skipping mitigation efforts skipping vaccine.

How anyone even remotely understand article realize that?

There's already comments say OH WELL means need get vaccinated. killing people real time spreading BS wishful thinking. use implanted chips shut people down.... like computer!

-facebook tomorrow. Wow, shit take. seen oppressive idiots, led murderer, doesnt matter churches care little deity parishioners. care revenue. confirm causation? correlation study? Hats you.

But, even begin trace contacts it‚Äôs insanely huge? Legend Curly's Gold Belgian authorities claiming strategy better everybody else wrong. Belgian government ministers claiming rest Europe following Belgian strategy.

Can provide links statements Swedish officials saying strategy best? I've watched probably 80% Swedish press conferences foreign reporters try get authorities speak countries strategies almost uniformly say ""every country needs use tools think applicable population, Sweden worked voluntary measures continue so."" 

[It's nothing like video Czech Republic released March telling everyone great masks right thing everyone don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking about, suits narrative. mean already weak people care about? people want stay fuck away most. someone death‚Äôs doorstep like say, probably won‚Äôt survive catching virus. 
I miss days thought average person common sense. sometimes tell stupid people bots/trolls make go insane. problem world people live impression strong ego make lack knowledge openness. need evolve civilization dysfunctional ever wish reach new technological age.  Yeah going Costco almost always use Google maps mobile app. tells busy times based people visit. Another way looking individuals 9 months freed time less socialization could spent learning new skill educating new field order change careers. *regime **See, right here. proof people interpret speculative BS fact simply would like true refuse vaccine skip mitigation efforts more.**

**THIS exactly posting articles like this. exact real time effect predicted RIGHT COMMENTS!** recommending masks dumb, believeing masks reason Sweden well think 2021 happen, 2022 potential.  Yes, anyone knows must Dr. Med. Bill Gates. lol. picked bad time start walking store 2 3 times week exercise... Normally vaccines takes years testing make sure safe see long protects people. Covid vaccines developed much faster there's risk Also China going fuck Australia hard ""Health status"" 124 patients ""was generally poor, particularly domains functional impairment (64%), fatigue (69%) QoL (72%)."" QoL - Quality life.

They mention research needed findings distressing. I‚Äôve heard talk putting teachers list number 2 3 schools open back up. I‚Äôm first grade teacher already told remain distance entire school year. I‚Äôd love vaccine get back classroom kids 2021. Y'all remember homeless doom sign guys? causes people take mitigation less seriously cause people take vaccine cuz internet said immune years!!!!

It's clickbait bullshit vast majority data points short term immunity. articles also calling resistance would still spread disease immunity YA'LL KEEP UPVOTING ANYWAY! 

It's stupid, naive taking human behavior account global crisis. reality there‚Äôs really substantial public transportation outside New York, DC major cities. Atlanta, capital state two train lines spread bus lines that‚Äôs it. Nowhere else entire state even much. never supposed _prevent_ second wave. They're another tool box _reducing_ spread, help situations keeping enough distance impossible. people think they're cure-all silver bullet either-or thing? They're hazmat suits cheat code real life. bit like claiming washing hands could stop second wave. stay home go symptoms don‚Äôt 100s people Combined misinformation anti-vaccine sentiment US, Covid-19 part America despite working vaccine roll out. Yo, americans stupid fuuuuuck. places takes longer get results, anyway.  comment uncivil? offer wipe student debt frontline staff levels ‚ÄúResidual pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities present 91% discharged patients, correlated reduced lung diffusion capacity. Twenty-two percent low exercise capacity, 19% low fat-free mass index, problems mental and/or cognitive function found 36% patients. Health status generally poor, particularly domains functional impairment (64%), fatigue (69%) QoL (72%).‚Äù drop aligned Summer holiday I‚Äôve saying along. Two weeks slow spread.....flatten curve. Great, let's lock in. need shut flights til February know downvoted. covid patients west coast February. think quite US collective consciousness yet. challenging freedom though say wear ounce paper face stay 6ft apart while? perhaps wealthy large corporations pay fair share. like may average immunity 6 months. clearly last least six months people. forced give estimate think doctors tell 6-12 months average immunity, mean right, current educated guess. 

Anybody says LEAST X months idea talking wants clickbait fame.

Speculating immunity last year people also pretty much useless likely counterproductive getting people actually listen. Immunity really useful point vaccine coming out, articles hurting ability get people take things seriously next months.

Long term immunity, short term immunity, really matter much. attempt actually get enough people immunity usually overwhelm hospitals, cause mass panic, screw economy, kill people achieve significant herd immunity.

**These articles also cause people take vaccine. stop voting crap. matter scientifically interested, right TIME.** would 21 days manufacture, distribute administer 40 million doses second shot. Risky. Electric cars positive impact air quality cities. that's it. I'm sure Mars, seem like nice place live in. Bb, captain trying tell winter already happened side globe. defeated Covid-19 WINTER. remarkable that? time Jan 20th comes along much Biden realistically try change course sort certainty speed millions unwilling comply reasonable health directives, rogue Govs likely even Senate side passing legislation assist. got $20 duck sub full Belgian redditors posting stories daily statistics Belgium. 

Because Belgian authorities claiming strategy better everybody else wrong. 

Because Belgian government ministers claiming rest Europe following Belgian strategy.  Nah Victoria screwed got second-wave.

Everyone gets top marks though. Idjit personal favorite. riiiights!! * lot Wait, you‚Äôre saying 100 400,000 high number?! 0.00025% people high number?! One 57x greater chance getting struck lightening that. Ok wish could like ten thousands times.

It‚Äôs moral failure poor America. lost ‚Äúreal‚Äù job spring. already hours cut since January due supply chain slowdown overseas. started turning sex work side year previous barely getting made slightly poverty wages wasn‚Äôt qualified aid programs. 

And pandemic, couldn‚Äôt sex work anymore. tried online stuff. Okay well don‚Äôt huge user base (mind you, people make $100 OnlyFans! camming, it‚Äôs oversaturated hard make much shit deal with) wasn‚Äôt making lot. I‚Äôm also mid-30s frank subpar looking best- can‚Äôt compete college girls online market. I‚Äôm hot takes huge toll mental health told ugly unattractive are.

Then lost room house due landlord declining renew (he knew lost job rented paying.) couldn‚Äôt rent anywhere else due unemployment. (Lots landlords restrictions like must current employment year, well unemployed 2 months point.) thought okay well I‚Äôll stay Airbnb‚Äôs blows summer. 

Obviously didn‚Äôt. Airbnbs doubles price start realizing isn‚Äôt ending need save every dime case hits winter. ended everything couldn‚Äôt sell storage unit life keepsakes know like clothes ha. lived campgrounds summer cheapest, safest place live. Plus showers. got one job interview, online work tried motel room WiFi connection bad, wasn‚Äôt accepted job.

I try rotate camps, motels, car it‚Äôs obviously getting colder woman it‚Äôs obviously safe. homeless population exploded county. shelters max capacity. housing vouchers five year waiting list pandemic. next time major housing charity org town even opening appt discuss options isn‚Äôt March. others shit luck.

The kicker former employer got six figures ppp grant money. still open. Hasn‚Äôt lost thing. fact hiring supposedly magically don‚Äôt fit roles exactly don‚Äôt bring others laid back. I‚Äôve people tell well that‚Äôs fair- good smart kind person potential would‚Äôve started business done fine too. quarter mil given parents start his. grew foster care. feel like ‚Äúif parents loved maybe wouldn‚Äôt ended streets sex worker.‚Äù actually problems sex work. know I‚Äôm statistic happens foster care kids (more half end homeless point lifetimes.)  Many foster kids end sex work kind associates painful abuse danger, kind associated e-girls already solid safety net. tried life reflective statistics yet am. 

And point: hate *myself* poor person don‚Äôt think deserve compassion. wish would‚Äôve ended better. loved enough others maybe wouldn‚Äôt place that‚Äôs obviously fault. It‚Äôs deeply entrenched country every societal failure personal moral failure even understand fact, still can‚Äôt apply brain continues beat churches want convert get aide people took pictures others food bank line pointed laugh us standing waiting box full mostly expired groceries covered mold stale. Here's source, guess February downvoted. 1000% facts. Texas hardest dick riding state Trump. think gonna let NYC nations highest infection rate one less densely populated areas world.

My wife open mental health actively make sure doesn‚Äôt get overwhelmed (although, days that‚Äôs granny babysitting day - quarantine bubble)

Our logic - always plan. Let‚Äôs safe let covid stop lives. sat around waited - that‚Äôs chunk life wasted won‚Äôt get back.  Stay home stay safe. closing year going horrific open form fall.

Online education anyone like 12 joke delusional pretend otherwise. Kids poorer families always access internet. Kids learning disabilities going worse. think back kid ton emotional problems somewhat unhappy home life, adults parents help super important me. would closed 3 past 8 months anyway.

If 8 years old substandard 2 semesters like third education. Somehow humanity managed tens thousands years without public schools, could manage one now.

What silly argument. also lived tens thousands years without modern medicine mean people getting medical treatment okay. ‚ÄúThe study also noted infected food handler could index case new outbreak, event - though unlikely - could still occur time time.‚Äù

Basically it‚Äôs unlikely spread way, wash damn hands handling raw foods, wear gloves. interesting switch recent death (last 14 days) pretty much flips. yeah fuck landlord wouldn‚Äôt budge. Vaccines contain adjuvants, additional ingredients cause stronger immune response real infection might. lead longer lasting immunity. know around remember chicken pox parties. Chicken pox thought harmless parents would little parties infect kids chickenpox could hurry get get infection way adult chickenpox apparently severe. 

We know chicken pox causes shingles. !00% effective would nice, everyone wears mask 2-weeks covid19 would become extinct /s need vaccine.

The masks drop r-rate 1.0 best get without vaccine. fellow german getting sadder sadder. rezo made new video summing current situation Aha interesting. hope stay well! *if Thanks helping shut professionals panickers. We've hearing since *January* thing would infect people twice, second infection much worse first one etc., (which obviously ridiculous since January early significant number people infected twice). Also note that, British study, number twice-infected people (all asymptomatic) perfectly explainable false positives, number essentially zero. Ohh, wish could immediately figure way fix it... Anger still emotion, there's plenty here. Fear, too. know, pandemic that's killing people basically completely unchecked. moment tell ‚Äúbut muh freedom!

It like switched President court process something along lines? Waiting whilst playing golf...wtf going USA? shit would never fly say decade ago. I‚Äôm addicted scratch offs. win sometimes. It‚Äôs real rush get card seems keep winning end hundreds dollars. keep track every dollar spend despite nice hundred dollar wins years, I‚Äôm overall $450. enjoy though. given vaccines approved emergency use provisions, traditional approval process used FDA, could concerns possible civil lawsuit consequences employer employee required (rather choose) receive vaccine experienced adverse effect?

there sure hell ought be. noone coerced taking vaccine like this. everyone sure singing different tune looked like approval might happen election. newsflash people fda month ago. real, statistical probability maths person likely hit lightning winning fucking lotto swap air anyone outside tiny bubble

I fucking wish! totally isolating except job, nightmare health care system one can't afford unemployed uninsured, jobs can't done remotely. sucks. Fingers crossed masks, air filters, staying far coworkers possible enough make get vaccine another mandated shutdown.

People wanting ‚Äúwait months‚Äù may hilarious simply secures fact you‚Äôre hopeless I‚Äôm sorry. I'm convinced timeline, I'd say likely year call things normal enough people get vaccine.

All know right Fort Detrik BSL4 leak happened last summer, Event 201 simulating coronavirus pandemic happened last October, classified NATO briefing coronavirus happened November, Europe US restricted testing Asian travelers March, genome tracing found earliest strain US.

Oh fact Trump IMAX level projector.

Don't worry, guilty ones pay reparation, China historically known forgiveness. Totally agree. 

I wonder, though, beyond recklessness selfishness (which also think probably main driving factors) many weird media/social media bubble barely ever even hear virus maybe dismissive memes. 

Sometimes talk parents anything substance I'm shocked they've never heard spend like unhealthy amount time worrying about. vulcan mind? virus hurts economy much restrictions. xenophobic weirdo.  Yes, started collapse NY, NJ Louisiana locked hard places (as society) sure whether would enough. NY able get healthcare workers travel help, people listened experts, system probably would collapsed.

If want find happens health care system collapses, keep eye Dakotas next couple weeks. midwest. Well said I‚Äôve never paid flu shot. CVS, Target, hell even Walmart given free flu shots USA. honestly even show schools give free. saw posts covid Facebook bringing new treatment PA still lot people thinking hoax one guy saying vitamin c actually read attached article he'd know that's is. People dumb. list criteria package insert hospital following now. Basically geared towards high risk patients hopes keeping hospital (we usually operating around capacity is). vials got federal government free given patients free (there could still charges room, nursing time, etc idk). 

Once becomes regularly approved medication purchase, yes, patients charged. correct. cannot lockdown. need national plan, mask mandate, lockdown (let's face it, US badly needs one) also proper follow after. Can't lockdown, watch case numbers drop, everybody prematurely celebrates though forget safety protocols.

Won't happen though. US also far gone point rest world shaking collective heads. bloody paper said that? Strike light. wear masks 2 rule can't enforced? samples harvested specified time points reflecting food transport timelines. found virus able survive remain infectious refrigeration freezer temperatures, 4 deg C -20 deg C respectively, three weeks. People also forget dental health plays huge role overall health. One infected tooth gumline go septic real fast. Dental health regular cleanings essential! Climate crisis make look like child's play. salad days. too. Let degeneracy begin! Busts drugs Maybe US, everyone else, say european. someone said Lenin, right Bolshevik revolution. Actually thought implement deploy preemptive attack risk infection detected.  can‚Äôt wait know serious case.  instance got positive test 70yo obese diabetic would show house call give IV. likely 40% less chance something like hospitalized.  

The primary proposed deployment preventative triggered factors.  drug might actually save crap ton money spent hospital icu treatment long run.  Actuaries might see bargain. Way Remdesovere.

I'll driving 8 hours home instead flying. Everything perfect balance. Health care workers long term care facilities getting first. risk dying. protects elderly us. get weekly testing takes anywhere 3 10 days get results back.

3. Somehow humanity managed tens thousands years without public schools, could manage one now. Seems like would easier cashier refuse someone checking employees chasing shoppers telling put mask leave. generally always I've sloppy levels checked recently. Careful now, might called communist. Though that's know right track. Got one April, amazing.  trump. Everyone knows what's now. People entitled selfish. Sorry, soon get vaccine, I'm going relax little. I've work in-person throughout this, I'll still mask public places required, I'm done freaking bullshit. Yes difference 5 million wearing masks, saftey procedures existed.
......That said, agree, stay f**k home, help flatten curve. Especially cause bet anti-maskers won't, that's unnecessary exposure. Oh, joking. least joke deep fry ice cream delicious.  fair,the CDC said Thanksgiving gatherings bad. family gathering weekend day must A-Ok. disobeying Ten Commandments decades, stop there.

If believe made mistake, please [message cooperation. guys want records 1. National mask mandate

Instead public health issue, became political issue President Trump trying benefit politically upcoming election.

He believed wearing mask unproven science maybe worse, showed weakness wore them. instead setting example, undermined severity disease attacked science justify position. Millions Americans followed quickly became nothing proposition, didn‚Äôt way. 

Rather take logical approach, attacked fully. Yeah, masks aren‚Äôt 100% effective. Social distancing isn‚Äôt 100% effective. Neither soap, use it. use things together, greatly reduce transmission virus. avoid lockdowns quarantines part protect fellow Americans. That‚Äôs message should‚Äôve - instead got complete total opposite, can‚Äôt put toothpaste back tube message got out. I'm disappointed humanity. remember 8 years ago spring world rallying, coming together fight virus. small glimmer hope human race disintegrated quickly appeared Yup. That's side state.

As turns out, though, CoS taking virus pretty seriously. put sorts restrictions visit stopped local Sea Org public activity. also cancelled remaining public charity community outreach events year. heard lot testing, too. 

Source: work Clearwater.  unbelievable. 200 000 DAILY infections, 250,000 dead , figures climbing. Want know happens hit ICU saturation?

It's scared; responsible. That‚Äôs ridiculous idea - even foreign press (such France24 interview ironically) tries push Tegnell FHM comment countries, careful giving advice countries. work Sweden, model based Swedish society, it‚Äôs ridiculous think would giving guidance countries. 

People view Sweden‚Äôs approach different, see affront towards decisions governments took year. I‚Äôm sure who‚Äôs right, big pathetic sub tries turn American style party politics. honestly probably higher know basic math cover this, it‚Äôs crazy Halloween three weeks ago. feels like couple months election crammed between.

Thanks suggestion ‚ù§Ô∏è truth there, know? Clearly many fans afraid wearing mask sounds like George Carlin would say show. governor still implement mask mandate. ::facepalm:: numbers like time last year, covid? That‚Äôs prime example cognitive dissonance. ton evidence smoking bad evidence kills thousands millions people year, also examples people smoked whole life ill effects. focus examples paint smoking bad light ignore bad. 

This smoking scenario often used example cognitive dissonance.  know ever feel comfortable traveling Florida again. Seeing awful decisions made pandemic questioning cleanliness general region. Forget bathing suit, Florida Hazmat season fans could. mother law ""I saw go around denying truth ""I saw reddit.""

It‚Äôs retarded MIL is. would similar MIL read subreddits like r/conservative worse.  pandemic end socially ends medically. think people tired restrictions now, wait till summer. new normal crew Twitter virtue signalers still care then. certainty, certainly. Although fear gone far rails, parties move house parties. Lolwat. Every time go ER US chest pain, supposed get seen instantly, wait 8 12 hours seen. 

Then charge extra day stay lasted past midnight.

You'd rather pay private insurance still go that? like everywhere here.  Thanks talking us racial features made clear unabashed xenophobe  Lol way could know .

Having vaccine awesome still people don‚Äôt believe matter? virus live among idiots long enough become something new. first time human history mass exodus science collective group. health care system doesn‚Äôt stand chance US. Used tol work convenience store, people would spend $700 sometimes $1,000 finally hit $500 $2 jumbo something, would post Facebook text call friends family bragging much money won.

Way go guys holding us back, slow slow clap. conspiracist makes less intelligent people picture. 

You extra chromosome.


And since hereditary, well get picture. ... happens spread control curve flattened. future consider Greek Tragedy. Seven senators tested positive: GOP senators. think examples like show taking covid seriously works. It‚Äôs perfect average joe trying hard protect likely work. Aside health care workers frontline workers, don‚Äôt think many people getting covid genuinely reasonably avoid it. Invest refrigerated semi trailers, like used transport refrigerated foods. They‚Äôre using [store places morgues already full. guess spreading disease vulnerable authentic Thanksgiving reenactment.....  similar situation summer someone works university. self isolating month PTO hoping riding big wave (egg face) went back work. demanded break isolation go nearby student hospital covid test wait line thousands people. make sense angle.

They want lot cheap, theatrical bullshit limited effectiveness. Anything actually shutting things giving refunds. friend! Cowboy fans kinda dumb af personal experience. really even follow football. know Cowboys fanbase laughing stock sports world.  agree ridiculous idea. Unfortunately doesnt make Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised Anders Tegnell, man behind Sweden's decision impose full coronavirus lockdown, rejecting tougher new restrictions United September. lot people would saved listened scientists. vaccine widely distributed spring. Stop dooming _lot_ people disinformed. Every time talk family rants hoax, flu, etc etc. Considering nobody cares stopping virus US, local, state, federal government leaders can't stop acting like children fighting playground, put much faith estimate. Get beta Obviously do. YEP! started trying discourage. ""Can even drive snow? plan use public transport (and link RTD saying making alternate plans cannot rely RTD buses full)."" I'd ask proper winter gear remind ""That make fun people ski Jeans"" link memes. 

And summer ""But everything fire, smoke air quality bad."" trying discourage people. 

Doesn't seem helping.

I also tried whole Covid = bad. Mountains = much hospitals etc. still keep getting more. Say louder politicians back. seem surprisingly low.  ratios active covid19 cases bed capacity look different  people missing Sweden test public spring. blockade texas off? Everything bigger texas including fuck ups essentially 0.01% chance getting conditions COVID, since ham young health conditions affect COVID symptoms. tired quarantine, even things open up, stay home wear mask go essentials/distanced walks. absolutely HATE staying home wearing masks passion, know there‚Äôs people vulnerable vulnerable family members would like protect them. I‚Äôd rather take bad experience staying home wearing masks/distancing someone else bad experience dying grieving family member friend passed away. I‚Äôd rather take -1 save someone -1,000. Lmao would much rather live America regardless many people get Covid Haiti. fucking delusional think Haiti better controlling Covid magically means better country live in. Get fuck require competent government getting shots out, hard believe last 4 years Well know it‚Äôs actually exact opposite want go Darwin theory.

99.5% people pictured bar survive, means fittest natural advantages surviving pandemic. people go kill ones won‚Äôt survive thus aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfittest‚Äù.

So really, estimation, vast majority people bar ‚Äúevolutionary superior‚Äù since vast majority survive. Obviously care.

You want quietly die alone. WHOEVER CONTROLS TP CONTROLS UNIVERSE! Thanks info, aware limitations. leading vaccines looking incredibly promising, I'm pretty optimistic summer next year life much normal. vaccinated enough people outbreaks smaller manageable. happening regards bathroom, weather conditions food preparation? Obviously staying home safest option truly considering going please take consideration happen weather cold and/or wet-will people throw caution wind gather inside? Also, using bathroom-will people gather coming going restroom, start chatting end doors? theory, believe types gathering safe, reality people behave cut corners start normalize breaking rules mean end actually safe. Excellent. gets better better. 

/s LOL. give up. makes even less sense going back forth on. They've always shut schools security issues associated general public school campus. idea they'd allow public security concern also public health concern shows little planning forethought is.

Here Florida mandated stop people entering polling location wearing face covering. went polling location, sign ""please wear one"" couple people line one on...  Even 100% party goers got covid might one two, probably 0, died Scam? one gaining anything shutting bars. literally meant save people's lives.

But go one conspiracy theories like self-proclaimed ""individual thinkers"" think 11th people. probably day told wfh, day school/daycare decided go virtual, day lost job, etc. me, day March 13. First, goal isn‚Äôt workers best. goal upper middle class feel safe leave homes spend money again.

Second, there‚Äôs pretty huge difference one-time cost billion dollars vaccine, pocket change kinds organizations significant stock pharmaceutical companies, funding public healthcare everyone, ongoing trillions-of-dollars cost.

edit: adjective still demands tuition, right?

Listen, I‚Äôm saying precautions bad universities first line scolded contributing spread. could gone remote students campus. know didn‚Äôt name money. Thanks, actually looking link correct appears show totals cases past 7 days. mistake. Generally seems states hit hard initially seeing larger spike now, hit hard better. Go Mike, death conscience rest life. Idc nuts run around saying SEE!! ""might"" help lawyers defending murder suspect.
"" Yes, honor, deceased multiple bullet holes appear come clients gun, victim covid positive, covid killed him"" 1. That‚Äôs definitely fire hazard. 

2. ones outside, guys ones supposedly never leave house unless need to. This.

It hit day life won‚Äôt change much over, aside feeling comfortable going store movies something. patience people general busted year don‚Äôt really want anything even Covid issue anymore. eat clean eat processed crap like everyone else .

If want get fat eat shit food . maybe care people. That's also major reason take precautions. witnessing embodiment American exceptionalism.

The good news longer pretend country isn‚Äôt broken. see clearly really going on.

Stay safe - hopefully explore options move someplace isn‚Äôt dysfunctional. reckless/stupid/selfish enough go like this, reckless/stupid/selfish enough alter holiday plans. stupid fall far tree. SF? DUH - (You forgot add duh end) Yes, correct. However, impacts Chinese Land Reform still strong terms resetting wealth China WW2.

Think you‚Äôre doing. think anyone suggesting virtually social interaction replacing person contact (it fine me, different strokes). 

However, midst global pandemic killing hundreds thousands US. 

If suck deal social isolation, many die necessary. 

Virtual contact better nothing valid option want put others danger recklessly traveling pandemic. deserve consequences. people complain got covid despite wearing mask smh idiots saying masks don‚Äôt work January, walked Lowe‚Äôs easily bought 5 N-95 masks. walked Home Depot bought 5 more. Back then, even Fauci saying masks don‚Äôt work. Even March saying this. average American ate lie up, are... take picture people bar. cannot take picture millions people, quietly right thing homes.

Source: 20-49 .0002 best estimate. .9998 survival rate, 99.98%. That's much government pay, American healthcare system could end charging know. I'm sure better government actually price less. 

I trust want see price consumers pay end. give treatment people caught something unnecessary without mask, hospitals wont overflowing. sidestep obvious assertion money literally traded commodity FOREX, also seem dug concept fiat currencies currency, fact medium exchange two parties literally currency.

Your assertion requirement wide acceptance ridiculous. American businessman, I'm going accept Chinese Yuan, Russian Rubles, Vietnamese Dong value me. currency not? They're me. value gold somebody wanted use medium trade would definitely take daily value. valued otter pelts accepted payment something would currency too, back day.

If simple facts that

1. Gold used currency millennia.
2. easily find someone today 2020 sell something want exchange gold Bitcoin.
3. every business near gold silver mine scale people could pay goods gold silver .

Are enough know tell ya. misinformed opinion make right. trade links day support side same... I'm really interested wasting time here. It‚Äôs funny people can‚Äôt accept certain age groups death rate indeed quite low.

People scared new vaccine rushed market normal good thing people skeptical something like something normally we've never really tested mRNA vaccine given mandate OMG hurry get one out.

On top testing mainly done corporations develop them, like drugs. SOoo another reason doubt anyone common sense come corporations already history pushing drugs shouldn't, reputation happily earned hundreds billions dollars achieving. 

You whine OMG could people mindset, really, already knew mindset pandemic hell surprised now? 

Imagine people chronic health problems making higher risk COVID lethality. Imagine people eat organic food avoid adding unknown stuff body. Imagine religious anti-science people.

There one mindset reasons here, many entirely unjustified

I think 30% people delaying going matter all. vaccine distribution probably plenty delay meet needs anyway even 20% people get it, that's going matter much RO goes since spread 20-30% unvaccinated people.

What's big problem there? vaccines want first. like enough like another 20 million doses ready next week. Someone forgot take Geodon pills morning. herd immunity can‚Äôt happen wit covid antibodies may even last body 3 months

That's pure speculation, possibly motivated fear. Got link? experience, everyone tells they're travelling city / state car ""safer."" Never mind still putting others risk... I'm sorry but:

Bum-dum-tiss nurse US, won‚Äôt able forgive many fellow Americans. caught covid earlier year, worry every day loved ones also healthcare. disgusted mortified pandemic played out. rest life never forget government people failed responding pandemic. US failing state eyes said better Strange capitalist dystopia guess.

Obviously real dystopia - different expected (where actually pretty well COVID

I'm wondering - makes say LA well? 5.9% positivity rate, good. feel sorry Americans follow scientific advice directions. many people outside wrongly assume reckless idiots, selfishly caring all. Studies already coming now. Data actually indicates immunity long-lasting. research needed, yadda-yadda, far encouraging. Anyone boat turn anywhere along huge NZ coast. 

Covid leaking US across borders. trying say? 

My advice would actually stop idiots start starve virus. US never this. Total failure leadership. Yeah there‚Äôs always sects violent extremist Buddhists. different religion, suppose. Roads cross state boarders like every half mile lot places, that‚Äôs even close do-able shit. Hopefully family comes fine. :( lock whole Australian State prevent spread states. can't Europe people live, work commute across states. Australia sparsely populated. course put side side. And, said, show Australia well Europe isn't. 

What responding to, statement implement measures Australia Europe would get effect. can't say that, many differences. can't compare numbers way. comparing numbers fall Europe spring Australia useful. LIBERATE TOILET PAPER!  I've already done that. quit old job April bad. well becoming political thing common sense thing (which people dont even seem capable thinking anymore).  $600 week people qualified unemployment.

all saying trumpets love trump despite behaviour , dont sitll love spite shit does, love EXACTLY annoy provoke people go Honestly anywhere northern Europe you‚Äôll fine. Plenty jobs higher fields need. think projection says outlook things real world. way things going, realistically looking April-May enough people vaccinated (plus residual immunity infections) see numbers slow dramatically. don‚Äôt know everyone thinks black white, after. going variation, general looking 10%-15% us population per month getting pricks based current production contractual obligations. back napkin - 12% four months (48% End April) plus immunity infections vaccination done December probably ~55% that‚Äôs enough significantly slow spread effectiveness current vaccines. Thanks polite reply. exchanges I've involved two angry sides.

I imagine bad outgoing people. I'm pretty much shut-in. lockdown I'm big deal started. end last summer, I'm pretty sick too. want things go back normal. feel acting normal make so.

I know change mind, wish love ones stay safe. Happy US thanks giving! Take 5000IU-10,000IU per day vit D3 April. flu shot expensive guys happy corona shot ""just"" price. Asian cities comparable to? feel like going worse finale of

And also senior public servant public servant charge health department. inquiry yet report expectation findings scathing likely lead heads rolling. Twice much, 2 dose series. Time day actually important factor whole thing. don‚Äôt think China really cares people Reddit think since things back normal there. Australia really sparsely populated everyone lives cities.  people low risk get virus worlds first mRNA virus. seems entirely normal fairly large percent would want wait see, that's normal response new things.

I can't really blame experimental vaccine rushed market. every right scared regardless aren't. much argument that, predictable human nature personal right adding risk factors acknowledge rapid vaccine roll like this.

I see matters much, need everyone get vaccinated get main benefit vaccine never going eradicate it. People protect well enough getting vaccine take risk direction, neither likely result significant amount people dying virus lethal main goal vaccine lower infection rate low enough becomes background noise pandemic one shut nations down.

I mean, like heart disease leading killer, yet America land meat grease too. People take lot risk tastes good vaccines people deny delay mostly bringing long vaccines really somewhere around 90% effective amount people spread drop dramatically get enough people vaccinated.

**Beyond really talking 20 million highest risk exposure people getting now, delay people guinea pigs watch anyway. always going happened.** US? Ya u guys beyond fked sorry u guys go thru this. think ultimately places open much possible upto u try avoid anyone high risk ur life. /r/titlegore None said helps poor Americans any. Nothing I've said inaccurate. make statements like ""Stimulus. lead wealth transfer"", clearly due billions pumped stock market ordinary Americans got $1200 check hmm ok ""Mr Facts"".

I'm shocked partisan are. actually believe party ""good guys"" lol literally unable see much USG failed! even discuss substance called stimulus bill, care passed team blocked America nation opposition party. nations able overcome partisanship wasn't?

Refusing blame entire system protect vulnerable Americans results system produces even faction within system heart gold. I'm sure insist blaming belligerent factions within Chinese government failed protect Chinese people crisis. shouting top lungs Chinese dictatorship failed! insisting nuance government designed assert USG good hearted despite failure protect citizens.

Anyway, take bare minimum go. Australia mandatory vaccine. fine. shit that's coming better prepared. China Singapore level human rights Germany, would still performed same? Germany's death toll German government's failure containing spread effectively China? Agreed. complete lack self-awareness scary. post perfect description yourself. surrender, tactical retreat! Reported breaking r/Coronavirus rules.

""Keep information high quality"" article idiotic, seasonal respiratory virus Northern hemisphere, US, Europe, Russia always gets hammered every year virus like this. There's bunch westerners live China reports business usual since earlier year, exception places needed quash outbreaks. 

Getting cases surviving pandemic source national pride, vast majority people obey lockdown rules without local government needing weld in.

Critics say CCP heavy handed dictatorship, personally think people fucking retarded understand little pain better potential shit storm they'd face later. Luxembourg already hit equivalent 400k cases US.

We also equivalent 4000deaths day.

Currently nearly 10% population actively infected still dont lockdown icu still 35% eventough highest numbers per capita europe since weeks. (1500/100k) UV kills covid19 expose chicken minimum 8h sunlight consuming it. Remember idea go fall 10k cases day?

Long time ago, galaxy, far, far away... it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm sure pessimism right term you‚Äôre describing. I‚Äôve lot reading uncertainty nihilism lately. really think optimism/pessimism include third option nihilism (which inherently negative although tends perception). put context I‚Äôll use test example:

You didn‚Äôt study test. feel optimistic results? Pessimistic? you‚Äôre feeling nihilistic, perhaps outlook might matter what, sit test, receive results, life continue onwards matter result is. saying East's success NOTHING human rights? hand heart going tell that? far I've heard countries claim: NZ, China S'pore. Pretty solid evidence reckon. lot getting 911 every day bit even invaded Chad revenge yet? Must true...I'm Canary Island I've never seen german partyin name whatever. always say, ""If worried catching COVID, wear mask. We're free make choice."" Sure, sounds great, want walk potentially infections exhalations go store."" fair read article recently talking airplanes environment extremely low transmission chance.

I read study article pointed (done department defense) seems legit. Also known halfwits shit brains. new fave calling fucking walnut. Idk calling walnut feels right. tighter restrictions recommendations Spring. Finland, bars, cafes, schools, gyms etc. closed Norway even slightly tighter restrictions. Gatherings 10 people banned Sweden limit 50. summer relaxed restrictions long time Sweden tighter restrictions goal restrictions could place long time without constantly adjust them. 

None Nordic countries recommended masks Spring short supply. Sweden one without recommendation. Finland recommendations think Denmark Norway masks mandatory circumstances.

As late, cases bit rise hope get bad Sweden. recorded 400 cases (we half Sweden's population) two days week, highest numbers since start pandemic. Smaller provinces able curb bad local outbreaks tight restrictions, spread happening capital area, officials seem sluggish act. 

Now banned team contact sports, gyms swimming pools stay open. Bars restaurants open, although sale alcohol must stopped early think capacity limited. though loophole lets night clubs operate night cafes, people party normally either drink home beforehand smuggle booze in. much Americans pay health insurance month? pay $0. Global pandemic fancy way saying spread across globe. says nothing real danger, IFR really low. Australia 12% Asian compared US 6%.

I think going 6 12% sort magical tipping point changes response pandemic among worst world among best. Australia NZ clear reason COVID success. extremely sparsely populated Islands middle nowhere. delusional think could plop Australia middle Central Europe level success cook ice cream, make sure... friend (a scientist course)started working vaccine February, companies ranging January March.

So approximately year. little less cases almost dead others. Yes reported protocol. Understand governments multiple centers power, often conflicting short-term interests. CCP example system get ahead loyalty, faithfully following party doctrine, rocking boat crucial millions careers. 

Emperor Xi clearly want early prudent closing air routes, otherwise China would done itself. 

And yes, virus circulating least Wuhan mid November. Despite this, restricting movement asap would helped great deal easing early rapid growth. Sweden really healthy population. knocking park.

Also, Belgium loosened mask mandate mid-September, Czechia reopened schools September 1st. Masks definitely work, Sweden's failure acknowledge mandate borderline criminal. Thank friendo! C: I'm definitely going it. one good thing pandemic I'm able save lot eating pay public transit haha stupid question fake breeze China, people masks turning backs God's Wonderful Breathing System‚Ñ¢.

I still can't believe someone said second part real. wonder still alive now. realize talking part company, German company, founded immigrant couple later bought Pfizer? Constructing differences based US private tenuous especially second vaccine got funded massive US government cash injection. Understandable. good day. It‚Äôs spread 3 months, number deaths one day 12 recently, yes it‚Äôs double digits.   still worst first mRNA vaccine still cautious. know viral risks better vaccine risks point. Small scale testing rolling tens millions people people take vaccine low risk virus ever hurt them, ever get mild cases. 

Since people get mild cases, far, still experimental vaccine framework, risks still significant. short term studies cannot possible find long term risks like everyone getting experiment treatment old people, many many decades life left genetic vaccine screw something up. equally frightening strange. Good day. Sure, lot days 1 28. people start media hype gets vaccines internationally. preventable? People r/COVIDpositive always post everything book despite still got sick. Tell spread preventable?  seeing unity states, tbh.

Also, good disagreeing civil manner, unlike posters here. always go pessimistic + prepper way im right im ready, im wrong im happy. Death part life, yes. What's odds covid one cut life short. fucking airborne Ebola.

Umm... though? missed part covid19 global pandemic? Common sense military massive contracting function wartime. Part set contracts use trucks stuff contingency begins contracts ready. probably  Cases decreasing US, talking about? literally said nobody cares weirdo something similar Thanksgiving. strict quarantine well 2 weeks got tested (spit) negative results. pulled son daycare 3 weeks. parents also quarantined several weeks prepare gathering. mean literally gone anywhere. grocery stores. Nothing. walks around block dog kid, pulled daycare. people within 50 ft us walks. feel 100% confident gather safely. Like you, quarantining well. 

Have taking vitamin keeping immune system strong? Odds slim would kill you... cases young folk mild. must acknowledge risk. fact you‚Äôre quarantining visit makes ok book. You‚Äôre putting risk one else. feel need post 500 different subreddits even belong? Dude Europe September

Honestly health care worker covid unit savings would quit right now.

I'd spend nice Christmas season holed home safe, wait couple months wave die down, walk new job vaccines available.

Whilst majority posters subreddits probably American, big minority elsewhere. Trump got votes 2016. still claims 2020. becoming supreme leader instead president Hey give Reddit awards! Canadian thanksgiving also nearly big deal states children vaccinated everyone else. time trials observation effects others. 

Can‚Äôt see reason would vaccinate children 2021. Hello darkness old friend... take vitamin K help prevent getting much, take something fatty since vitamin one 4 fat soluble vitamins. Oh I'll stay fuck home, alone. Like always. ... still blaming Chinese people want feds do? ruled dictatorship. Americans, part, still charge destinies (for better worse). First off, sincerely say thank you. 

And mean back wearing mask everything humanly slow spread. 

Please take care best satay safe. Conversely: he‚Äôs also saying it‚Äôs hoax barely affects anyone might sceptical it. Anyone capable believing it‚Äôs hoax get vaccine quite nutter. Thy Done üëäüèª agree this. Also, wife health issues make us vulnerable, but... also plenty cash. Cash allows us stay home, everything delivered, make sure everything coming house disinfected. 

I know tons (health) vulnerable people situation, categorizing one priority group make sense.

So addition enforceable rules prioritization (healthcare workers first), also guidelines people follow old people getting vaccinated go cruise ships people want get vaccinated safe essential jobs. May best go side caution get bigger one? 
IF left over, used dishes afterwards. Win win really. picked information divers (OWD - vacation myself)... 

They get fucked get it. Overly dramatic headline. someone buys toilet paper mean panicked it. planning go store weeks, makes sense buy pack toilet paper. would dumb break effective lockdown *just* buy tp. So, go store, many people get pack since want come back.

Multiply thought process everyone, suddenly shelves empty again. people freaking out, want come back store get toilet paper.

My family milk eggs delivered house weekly, well bi-weekly delivery veggies community farm. stock canned goods, etc, need grocery trip every 2-3 weeks. ready Destroy Democracy December? That‚Äôs interesting That's good understand that. again, better axe one 30 risk everything die.

They sacrifice others live comfort.  asking one thing us. throw big gatherings.  

We absolutely ONE year. others chance many more.  Man models end-of-days level scary. Let's hope ""Average model"" accurate,

But personally I'd making daily plans based pessimistic view, since sh!t get really bad places really soon.

Stay home can. Avoid people. Skip thanskgiving. Wear mask.

^1 
^2 can't right? vaccines developed years years studies? 

Considering health effects swine flu vaccine people think dumb bit skeptic vaccine that's developed distributed fast possible. 

I've taken vaccines offer, i've vaccinated kids i'm gonna lie, i'm teeny bit worried one unlike vaccines know anything yet read safe getting it. I'm guessing health care workers risk groups first line time read turn. would best birthday gift I've ever received.  Never said cases going June 18th, saying decreasing well. made seem like cases decreasing/low summer, simply true. Everyone work Med/Surg floors. We‚Äôll send critically ill patients ‚Äúcovid hole‚Äù RN 5 actively dying patients proper PPE allied health support. Since we‚Äôre going low acuity areas hospital new ICU standard strict triage care; don‚Äôt staff everyone wants work ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù covid patients. So, 3 nurses ‚Äúcovid hole‚Äù- three rounds CPR patient max, pushing code meds, need stocked healthier patients Med/Surg may issue, help turning cleaning (those techs needed help ambulate Med/Surg patients.) w find like 9 stuck up, holier thou, superiority complex RN‚Äôs work critical care need ego stroked rotate ‚Äúhole.‚Äù cares? didn‚Äôt want get PTSD moved Med/Surg.

Well, see now: craved fast paced high demand environment forfeited right object ongoing increasing nightmare communicable disease ravaging country. 

I‚Äôll say again, didn‚Äôt want PTSD shouldn‚Äôt become critical care nurse! Duh! 

Having proper equipment, reasonable break schedules, coverage time missed due covid sickness, certainly increased staffing levels across unit share burden due! chose ICU, there‚Äôs pandemic; obviously can‚Äôt expect less critically ill patients mixed assignment emergency, shouldn‚Äôt expect staffing techs, aids, social workers, chaplains physicians/NP‚Äôs address drastic increase acuity mortality unit, ‚Äútoo smart Med/Surg‚Äù moron! 

I seldom heard cynical, abrasive, patronizing, victim-blaming take nurse staffing, stress, PTSD, burnout outside upper level admin meeting CNO, CMO, next unit manager bucking comfy senior management role hospital, finance, comptroller Human Resources managers discuss upper management bonuses tied keeping staffing full time FTE levels quarter increased federal reimbursement patient satisfaction quarter.

The hospital hiring lots important roles past 15 years, like new HR position ‚Äúmorale retention focused‚Äù - order address turnover hospital baskets chocolates Friday mornings, half smoothie sundays cafe, ‚Äúgeneric hospital role day‚Äù one underpaid understaffed job type/field gets nice ‚Äúthank you‚Äù message sent PA system $15 gift cards Target free cookies coffee every morning week cafeteria!

Could invest pension plan would cover employees golden years? Sure! 

Could lower astronomical health insurance premiums? Sure! 

Could push back private insurance industry whole foisted ever increasing asinine charting requirements eat time floor directly take away patient care/interaction? Sure! 

Could advocate appropriate pay, hours, staffing, mandatory time off/paid vacation scheduling every quarter, support nurses, doctors, allied health professionals clinical judgment indicates patient needs care, transfer higher acuity, new consultant, two three days inpatient ensure recovery? Yeah could! 

Maybe hospital administration could stop purchasing newest unproven, untested electronic health record/charting/notation/ordering/Med administration software/hardware/ecosystem instead invest money ‚Äúpeople power‚Äù wield ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù care for, treat, educate, comfort, confront, instruct, evaluate, assess, laugh, cry, connect, etc. walking ATM‚Äôs us calling ‚Äúclients‚Äù force us approach script, interact series menu prompts EHR eject facility warp speed clear bed next table customers?

Here one got leader (with mean, doctors explaining gaps testing patients? Rip money ignore bit cultural influence? mention fact 2019, 30% Australians born overseas, addition almost half least one parent born overseas. ...cutting Quixotic path towards herd immunity via natural infection goal

When get past straw man argument?! never true, never be! many times debunked get real discussion Sweden do?

No Sweden herd immunity strategy, Sweden legally lockdown, Sweden willfully killing old people. things said true subreddit, despite Swedes say. try argue (and downvote falsehoods) get called ""the Swedish brigade"" ""Swedish trolls"". 

There still plenty things discussed Sweden without spreading falsehoods. demanding masks situations difficult keep distance? financial support people risk groups staying home took long get trough government? Swedish regions thought good idea reduce capacity public transport fewer people travelled work? privately run nursing homes allowed deteriorate far last couple decades? Etc.

There's loads things worth discussing! seem stuck straw man argument since March. really 20 million since person needs two doses. would expert big impact yet go medical staff others likely spread vs much larger group vulnerable lethality.

People nursing homes get infection rates much higher that's really medical staff anything else. That's stopping spreaders usually important. 

There vulnerability death get vulnerability infection due living conditions career. Vulnerability infection target people vulnerable lethality, likely spread vulnerable provide service require regularly cannot done safe way ensure low infection rates.

Lethality down, infection rate still quite high. seems obvious want target infection rate impact. land border, never completely keep virus out.

According reports, even North Korea (the isolationist country world, country one wants break into) couldn‚Äôt keep virus out.

New Zealand literally island (well, two islands) even couldn‚Äôt stop virus re-entering country (and never find got back in). That's thing, COVID spread asymptomatically. someone might sick even though know it. think called Normalcy Bias something like that. exponentially easier stomp new outbreaks many cases begin with. guys lot things right, unwillingness even acknowledge geographical advantages played role tiresome. Shelbyville Ky here. That's happening. leaving topic, Valentine's day specifically, really need designated day tell S.O. love them? Like said, day - DAYS - work; heck, S.O. know everyday we're talking words affirmation. Interesting many drugs prescribed ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù children meaning clinical trial adults doctors prescribe children can't imagine true. shitty is, pandemic not, seeing SNL dream many. people dumb enough eat inside restaurants right now, see shortage wanting see SNL live. sheriff Governor isn't? side. 

Well, you. page's update nov 19 2020

here's full cdc article actually enough population americans keep hitting 200k cases day without hitting point basically every american infected? Joe recently said Democrats didn‚Äôt enough people last couple decades. that‚Äôs veep. sort mea culpa rare among politicians. gives hope president people.

I understand cynical response that, fucked times, know realizes unless addresses underlying issues we‚Äôll right back long. We‚Äôll find soon enough. vaccine *inhales...*

The two vaccines already announced efficacy rates BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna vaccines. two vaccines what's called mRNA vaccines, new type vaccine proposed 1990. initially proposed, one benefits mRNA vaccine discussed quickly developed.

Essentially, mRNA vaccine uses ribonucleic acid engineered genetic code peplomers used SARS-COV-2 invade cells. invaded cell, SARS-COV-2, coronavirus causes COVID-19, leaks genetic code SARS-COV-2 envelope proteins, command cell create clones virus. Eventually, cell inflated new SARS-COV-2 viruses within bursts. viruses continue process cells. Eventually, immune system overwhelms trying combat process, damaging body collection symptoms labeled COVID-19.

By using RNA train body fight peplomers, SARS-COV-2 unable invade cells, first step causing COVID-19. vaccine literally composed RNA, engineered help body create peplomer glycoproteins, body fights off. RNA, short ribonucleic acid, vital, naturally-occurring acid found within every cell body assists bodies creating protein. Fearing vaccine like fearing blood water.  someone explain why:
1.) people stupid America still socialising, travelling, etc? And,
2.) government isn‚Äôt locking EVERYTHING? Australia, Melbourne locked completely months fight WORKED. 

Sorry seem like dumb questions. don‚Äôt understand America letting thing run wild? people even care people dying healthcare workers suffering getting sick/dying people‚Äôs selfish idiotic actions? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Asia maybe. Australia nz memory draw upon There's lot anger thread.  come back finger-pointing here. China first acknowledged could wet markets, never found patient zero. 

I know people dismissed theory, considering Italy report United States summer prior global pandemic people hospitalized exact covid symptoms claimed caused THC oil vape cartridges.. also increase unexplained pneumonia elderly along lot people getting extremely sick testing negative flu.. sisters family got sick 2019 went emergency care.. tested negative influenza

That‚Äôs one heck coincidence. lot holes stories vape cases Fuck every one people, individually, great abandon. hate people can't drink alcohol. true. remember also hearing companies go decent lengths obscure ownership make think you‚Äôre dealing mom pop shop stuff like keeping old ‚Äúfamily‚Äù owners contracted public face home etc. like reversed natural selection stupids cause one die Stupidity article: ""At time, number new daily cases per capita¬†‚Äì calculated 7-day rolling average¬†‚Äì had¬†decreased average 6%¬†among counties mask mandate increased 100% counties without mandate."" advancements treatment time. cannot take forever number cases forever number deaths. look demographics recent numbers (once treatments emerged).

I would also add examples abject policy failure reliant upon foundational miscalculations human behavior.

Namely, neoliberal ‚Äúfree market‚Äù anti-regulatory thinking. entire theory predicated human interest rational guided best outcome pure self-interest. need regulate, people inherently capable self-governance.

What load garbage. People need form regulation placed society safe. Case point. It‚Äôs called FREEDOM baby point timescale purely arbitrary measure. work clinical research working non-stop since March.

It‚Äôs kind fellow Georgians issue people selfish ridiculous, raising numbers prolonging this. I'm sick ""covid fatigue"" bullshit. go work terrified catching dying or, worse, passing older mother lives die people ""tired"" wearing mask need get socialize like irresponsible child. Frankly, hard time believing people took proper precautions first place time I've pressed anyone (including plenty healthcare professionals) part, I'm always disappointed. People traveling, gathering, wearing masks know should, simply finding ways justify behavior. Increasing testing solve issues. Hell, good luck getting half people submit regular testing let along abide sort rules positive tests. talking senior advisor Corona yes talking resisting travel advice travel Wuhan shut prevent 5 millions people moving around China . . 

50 million Americans traveling Thanksgiving probably Christmas.

All Hospitals mobile morgues stack bodies..... sign waiver can‚Äôt seek medical attention? Why? risk spreaders (potential hosts act way may spread it) ones need vaccinate reduce spread rates? 

You looking vaccines selfish commodity medical tool are. 

Unfortunately psychology people ignoring virus drinking without masks public disobeying social distancing likely apt lend wanting vaccine first place. 

So worries, probably readily available smart people! number people think Obama didn‚Äôt enough 9/11 isn‚Äôt zero know 24 year old woman (should lowest risk group) asymptomatically. used damn close maxing army physical fitness exam. can't finish two mile.

I‚Äôm trying explain counties didn‚Äôt mask mandate hardly cases time. info comparing apples oranges assumptions people making population density, initial infection rates, test rates, population changes due colleges starting, starting dates K-12 schools, etc incorrect. Please look comment history explain actually happening Kansas time. perspective seem lacking. person making claim here. claim relies using single value low end estimates provided. need give additional sources sources illustrate claim 70 million already infected 1.2 million new cases per day way high. Delusions Grandeur? voted Kanye, lost. realize live like forever. means lockdowns masks forever. want walk around bubble forever? way effective restrictions people want follow them.

That's nonsense. Restrictions ever effect people want follow them. completely missed point ignored questions. answer yours?

None relate talking about. I'm anti-Vax get flu shot every year, I'm sure fuck hopping board barely tested vaccine day 1. amount shit know long term effects even effective makes cautious. normal drug release kind. I've done perfectly fine working home isolation year. Hell I've thrived. I'll stick strategy bit. I'm rush return social shit friends blast playing tabletop simulator games online. College student relate. you‚Äôre feeling down, please reach friends family even me. indeed super wrong. everyone catches Covid covid denier. friendly reminder others may similar judgement. people may luxury stay home global pandemic. may ringing groceries, teaching kids, caring sick. great attitude. know stopped want reminder people. tryna victim blame anything like... dumb people are, company leadership dumb definitely resources place prevent 1000 people inside store aren‚Äôt utilizing profits people apparently Mask wearing seems par turn signal use, 20%. could jave worded said much nicer would affect.

You rude OP expressing feelings *a lot* people feeling. Enough people shown interest work I'm thinking thing time plot [like gets pretty crowded super informative. really become ""frightening"" people actually want live? valid literally everything Dieing ICU without family around pretty alienating too. Maybe wasn‚Äôt super clear... literally working. fam visits me. We‚Äôve cancelled everything planned new year. membersJoin

luckily probably less 70% people need take herd immunity, think polling said 70% people would take vaccine today available. right this. goal isn‚Äôt eradicating it. goal eliminating disruptive public health threat, vaccines play enormous role accomplishing I've helped spatchcock turkey pretty brutal affair tbh.

Worth effort, something ordinary poultry shears. They're retarded so, blood hands too. become dem vs conserv issue could common sense all. course since political people side ""just cuz"" tribalism. wouldnt. virus. going transmit, matter guidelines seen. also avoiding large gatherings. people go every day super markers, schools. daily life. again. mask mandate social distancing doesnt work long term.  know sympathy meets criteria.

According mods, yes, does. Still think we‚Äôre greatest country world? people catching possibility subreddit influence impression management operation. y‚Äôall miss big ass signs right front?! ‚ÄúGET FLU SHOT TODAY FREE GET FUCKIN‚Äô GIFT CARD‚Äù right walk probably like 3 signs. Plus Walgreens across grocery store moving banner says same, plenty time read 5 minute red light intersection. missed it‚Äôs 497 pieces mail receive per week ads them. Haha ur right lets let healthcare system collapse lol. stories others like seen constantly beginning outbreak - remember tragic New Jersey family- people need stay home.

I can‚Äôt imagine grief guilt would feel part gathering family members got infected.

In party, 12 got sick. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. TP must flow. Actually does. everyone travels sees family time, it‚Äôs gonna lead way infections people spaced visits more. Americans refuse vaccine? Sweden ""herd immunity"" strategy literally misinformation.  No, he‚Äôs gross person. trust first kind vaccine rushed out. Especially considering also gonna edit RNA body fight covid. I've gotten vaccines past want need vaccine something survival rate 99.75%.

And based last post went, I'm expecting downvoted this. you, know people subreddit downvote cause agree views. paper work done 6 months ago. bit late, well ... Academic papers... Law enforcement across country openly saying they're enforcing social gathering complaints mask complaints lmao admittedly downside, yes. Proper Vaccine 5 months around right? Even whatever good news getting. Yuppppp. People anxious edge due pandemic. people anxious angry. People always want place blame somewhere. Who/What blame? stub toe you‚Äôre hurt. goes car accident unless willingly collide someone. choice people make could impact innocent people. may well get COVID-19 symptoms may spread people may fare well.  want go concentration camp Xinjiang? not? go parks beaches ordering groceries/takeout online delivery, COVID's going get you. ""Snowbirds"" far likely slip fall ice get COVID Florida outdoor activities. temporary ink stamp one thing buddy, I'm advocating going Full Nazi. Never go full Nazi. stay away nursing homes people 55 older Nah right, let‚Äôs let enough old people die till maybe semblance grief starts collectively striking people. art regretting stuff. true. patients hospitals receive oxygen. depending region, they'll steroids, maybe makes patients better temporarily probably causes harm good overall, remdesivir, proven anything. maybe places still clinging hydroxychloroquine help either. everyone DEFINITELY gets way higher concentration virus, patients put wards packed sick covid patients. air areas dense covid particles.  course, keeping sugars blood pressure controlled patients underlying severe comorbidities help some, that's pass existing diseases (heart failure etc). antibiotics patients develop superimposed pneumonia.. again, pills people easily get pharmacy.
AS NOW--- NOTHING HOSPITALS TREAT COVID (that actually works). Well, quite - cases left managed isolation, none community right now, think.

COVID-cases meant, although I‚Äôm favour isolating stupidity well, tbh. said 8 months ago. going get 300 million people agree something.

Downvote me. Maybe military fly jets Fort Lauderdale ‚ÄúThank Essential Workers‚Äú gesture. make Fort Lauderdale politicians citizens feel good this. Yeah, we're meeting family friends, seen 8 months Millennial echoes experience too, I'm sorry things worse Gen Z. get internship 2007 2008 - recession, money pay interns, full time staff. 2009 graduated, money new full time staff! got literally one interview, one offer, accepted it. always quit, no? lumping several things one pot be.

1. Pandemic fatigue real. 
2. low risk activities mitigate fatigue. Balancing personal health public health.
3. absolutely judge idiots responsible type behavior made whole thing clusterfuck. Sign petition governor statewide mask 99.9% survive given look young. 99% even need hospital bed. Using current CDC infection rate, created 36,350 new cases cause additional 778 deaths. ""AAA anticipates least 10% drop travel ‚Äì largest one-year decrease since Great Recession 2008.""  would annoy too, outraged don‚Äôt even know lol least respect! Every mask mandate I‚Äôve seen says take you‚Äôre eating drinking  Why? hunkering protection, presumably, virtue signal. long staying safe, nothing else matter.

If abstained alcohol health reasons, would complain people drink much? Probably not. job choice tho? Lol one forcing anyone medical worker. 

Your argument essentially ""oh forcing things well inside realm possibilities knew signing started career!"" good would knowing people routinely ignore safety fellow humans thought infecting others? get bad facsimile troll, willfully stupid? get red stamp. Congratulations. Idiot. right get together families Thanksgiving. Real smart. Let reminder everyone: leaving things ""personal responsibility"" means giving widespread irresponsibility.  Depends think governor's executive order carriers weight not. stupid people risking lives, shoot them? Isnt kind worse? Ditto feel pain. left old job, partly lack common sense wearing masks/social distancing amongst old coworkers. politicized top company think 80% unwillingness came pressure appear liberal. It‚Äôs annoying due failure right-leaning leadership support science actually set good examples people. nonsense trickles creates mayhem shouldn‚Äôt be... it‚Äôs gross. Young people fucking selfish stupid Meanwhile Texas' senator gloating fights left's ""culture war Thanksgiving"" Twitter.

This pandemic described failure every level. Federal, state, local. He's really given people permission structure air ignorance selfishness they've hiding shame. many disparate groups idolize him: religious nuts feel empowered, nationalists validated, racists dogwhistled, anti-intellectuals vindicated, selfishness virtue, xenophobia makes patriotic.

Considering 10,000,000+ people voted Trump 2020 2016, I'd say learning ""what put charge"" exact opposite what's happening. got banned expressing shock group people used concerned prospect panels people deciding gets healthcare dies seem nonplussed happening real life around country now.

Interesting We‚Äôre headed towards herd immunity well vaccine release...lol honest clear direction coming several sources americans want cake eat well. 

so Fauci says, 'don't go restaurant get plane' look like funny little man - local councilman knows nothing epidemiology decides wants mcdonalds open.

Fucking take responsibility either listening real scientists public health officials deal dead bodies. TAIWAN NUMBER ONE miss EMT. cool lot ways, getting regular sleep, worrying infections, getting attacked, coming home entire days time, constantly testing back seem worth amount pay getting. me, know lot people like irregularity job, time EMS taught I'm 9 5 office job kind person. gone April think people forgetting ccp wants shit bed long vilify you.

High rate positives test almost medical workers probable cases. Go figure. woodda thunk? fuck CDC fail Florence Nightingale 101? That's actually debating driving versus flying visit dad Christmas. probably drive quarantine 14 days risk one two bathroom stops, probably riskier drive fly. Riskier fly, though. Well, it‚Äôs consolation, weird year last came from. Next Christmas certainly normal. whole week forever etched mind. I‚Äôm teacher no-student day Monday, school cancelled mid-day Thursday. went school June clean up, March 12 still written board. Infinity fucked Must testing.

Unless husband made plumber, paranoid. fine. matter

They literally innocent defenseless human beings

But keep trying defend voluntarily killing innocent innocent defenseless human beings convenient

Your mentality allowed slavery thrive. Blacks viewed human beings. viewed nuisances objects

Not good look. Contact tracing never happened mean? 2000 per day... big deal right? Good good good! hope healthcare workers US walk out. Serves us right Wrong. First wave started back november, second wave june, 3d wave 3 weeks ago. problem many would consider 5% low.

Even people still understand concept Exponential Growth time lag.

I believe Trump supporters would behaved differently IFR % higher. People acting like never family gathering again. Restrictions lasting forever.

But get used CONTOLLLLLLED! 

/s, case tell. Im talking worldwide tool. Taiwan pay anything China. country.  Give trying make part china's shitty communist ways.  would ruin everything good Taiwan. say use ""formidable landmark"" instead! Pretty tortured reasoning twist like reinforced, guess.

There go acting like people agree subhuman idiots can't even type something search bar.

I arguing anti-maskwr earlier 20+ high quality studies showing masks work. went back forth benefits limitations studies versus studies show work.

Many intelligent people media bubble, present amplify studies, media bubble present downplays them. 

Lying reinforces bubble, trying coax pop it. causes people behave properly pandemic, could save lives long run ‚Äì lot people dying US good chance hitting 4k deaths per day. Either way, healthcare professionals completely reasonable tell everyone go fuck leave, opinion. Everyone gets tested quarantine New Zealand. Same, wife 5 months pregnant. We‚Äôre going doctors appointments. I‚Äôve bought treadmill. Good luck you! Hi Key West. 

Ditto! Chinese New Year quite phenomena. period absolutely everyone would go back home state China celebrate occasion families friends, leaving many major cities significantly less populated. 5 million people left Wuhan, travel countries, went provinces. Despite complications rest China outside hubei early onset virus, remarkably well contain quickly. I'm sorry youre fatigued adjectives nouns  proud this, family member actually said heard shot turn 5g antenna.... fuck even related? Stop getting news FaceFuck. I‚Äôve two (UK) drive nurses. first operation September wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. second scare 3 weeks later nearly puked twice procedure painful. I‚Äôd another second nurse would ask sedated. I‚Äôd shit administering Yeah, BC Canada, we've mandated masks public spaces, advise nobody visitors home, congregate anyone outside bubble, etc. bars still open, gyms, dine-in restaurants, cafes. ridiculous. Constant half measures feet dragging. lunatic take point beyond understanding. 

The US response complete abject failure every level. ccp welding people apartments still asking people pretty pretty please wear mask public quarter million dead. fucking hilarious party personal responsibility still shrieking communists fault government worse nothing. think become complicated participate society without proof vaccination. read it, read transcript cspan meeting. you? sure downvoting post: people masks, people social distancing people pro-selfish pricks. I'm guessing venn diagram looks like fried egg. ‚ÄúPeople advised walk cliff, opted walk cliff saw 100% rise deaths canyon floor‚Äù Hmmm seems inconclusive. tested people flight 4 got sick? rich friends work(ed) law, medical, IT/software, food. worked it. half, sure. 100% survival &lt; 20 yrs old

99.9 % survival rate 25- 35 yrs old

99.6% survival rate 35 - 55 yrs old. 

99% survuval rate 70 yrs old. sucks actually need research get bench warrant like anyone else pay fine. let's hope ski resorts open! think doctors probably appreciate funnel patients mobile morgues know? üòá I. Maybe walk people wake up. said this? Fauci? 

I thought Fauci pretty heavy ‚Äúmasks distancing stay while‚Äù ‚Äúwhile‚Äù undefined.

Can provide link? need look way. survive week long hospital stay, end long term debt. I'm fearful dying fear bankrupt. may seem egregious EMTs get paid more, thing realize paid little easy replace. EMT minimal training health care, involves getting BLS certified take classes. low salary reflects ease entry. way salaries go EMTs refuse work offered rates. training easy, easily replaced essentially entry level job, like nursing assistant registered nurse. 

Note: EMTs paramedics, highly trained also earn more. software detect COVID coughing it? I‚Äôd like app that. (as generally, I'm French) cannot allow people like delay reopening enough time given people get vaccinated. least, rights afforded people vaccinated. way. That‚Äôs 100 days away. would require million cases per day majority infected then. 

People stupid even stubborn Americans take personal action protect gets point. hope. one questions real answers 83 million people lived North Dakota North Dakota. one cosmopolitan areas America, likely Democrat/liberal/progressive state totally different reaction behave pandemic.

If someone could 83 million people North Dakota, still thought acted like rural North Dakotans, would worldwide epicenter everything bad pandemic. Bill Gates acccckkkkshually putting toxins vaccines make people infertile, crazy conspiracy theorists claiming wants implant chips people controlled opposition meant allow dismiss question crazy conspiracy theorists. fine, kids fine, unless husband distance plumber, he‚Äôs fine part number Americans travel Thanksgiving misleading. 5 million correct estimate amount people left Wuhan January lockdown, total number people travel Chinese New Year within China. 50 million Americans travel Thanksgiving small number compared 500 million people within China travel Chinese New Year, making combined 2 billion trips car, rail, plane. largest annual human migration kind world. 5 million Wuhan people left city, infected much larger crowds people travelled Chinese New Year spread people travelled overseas. flu guys chill South Dakota hospital CEO. Bill Gates already payed taxes life entire family lineage pay next 1000 years. 

Maybe something life use money good like does. grew santa, feel figured out? rewarding, like solving puzzle, religiously-life affirming, like Jesus spirit gift-giving, traumatizing, realizing magic lie everyone trusted lying swearing you?

(It's something strikes almost every year, feels rude ask someone person.) still clearly like flu.... Right everyone actually have, search herd immunity, get point :) logistics distribution vaccine candidates taken account making estimates.

it really bizarre seeing people say ""but freezers"" fauci made similar estimate article. pfizer's temp requirements public months, would real shock know did. dry ice shortage months ago already preparing  thing is, Australia shut border, also shut land border states. People prohibited leaving city outbreaks - much China's playbook.

UK land borders either... still shit-show there. awkward moment give state governor ticket huge fine.

Though Ulysses S. Grant arrested speeding DC (on horse), upon time police enforced laws even US President. believe repeat offender who'd gotten couple warnings. welcome. Wish speedy recovery! Peter North super spreader sisters NP got 10k raise due covid. virus would ended Vaccine work everyone gets it. way make everyone get make free. Trying mourn every stranger dies would quickly lose sanity. saw Facebook post one three uncles today. Mainly, railing tyrannical mask mandates (His word, mine) healthy side ""Don't tell many people home"".

From devolved screed socialism somehow twisted upon complaint government helping need most. Honestly, pretty accurate summary read.

I skipped tyranny freedom comments zeroed whole ""no one government helping us tough times"" thing. explained second pandemic relief bill passed house May, refined reoffered house Senate early October. told right angry lack support, needed aim anger proper direction. Namely, two Republican senators, Ted Cruz John Cornyn. told two versions relief bill republican-led Senate utterly refused even bring floor vote.

Then deleted whole thing moved on. honestly, see masks tyranny, can't piece together limited gatherings recommendation deadly highly contagious pandemic, finer points legislation works ever going hit home.

But circle back point, liberal wing Democratic party wants get financial relief people badly affected. folks want raise minimum wage something livable. never ceases amaze even access accurate information, people family support vote self interests. Yes. real reason. Yep. despise Tucker Carlson Sean Hannity done Fox news.   rural parts drive through, couple bars gyms never closed, even initial ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù. saw local story teen girl part trial. mother works hospital trial performed. Overly cautious fine, basing cautiousness something that's false claiming everyone wrong denier subscribing false premise.  countries get shit control holding rest us back. damaging global economy. need get fucking shit together actually squash virus nations done. Big Head says otherwise. Holy shit, seriously give Trump single fucking win? use Dolly fucking Parton place him?

It Trump‚Äôs fucking administration, Trump lead, fucking funded vaccines. Trump gave companies federal money create manufacture vaccines. It‚Äôs Trump helped set plan distributing vaccines they‚Äôre ready. even Trump said we‚Äôll probably vaccine ready end year, literally everyone said ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt done‚Äù Trump ‚Äúis dangerously misleading public,‚Äù etc.

But no. Dolly Parton one responsible that. JFC even hear yourself? Kagfucked Yes, less go chances drop. That's enough without getting closer..'  lol? course never beat virus, also never said did. done, far, manage contain control new cases they've had. I‚Äôve asking literally want answered still haven‚Äôt told me

They explained vaccines made they‚Äôve paused trials they‚Äôve started back again. point, need trust experts. personally want know? Genuinely curious  remember India almost broke 100,000 cases day peak? months ago..... Agree point. mean China evil highly competent. Trump/GOP evil highly incompetent. happened March 11?covid hit February. It‚Äôs longest corner anyone ever seen roflmao. potential human being. asked you. one needs bring evidence extraordinary claim, dismissed offhand.

So, evidence? credible sources? declarations dont interest me. making extraordinary claim, bring evidence sumarly dismissed like claims god

I know nation comparable size capital-IST USA. America awake. exactly organized do. 

Honestly, I'd rather New Zealand Shanghai Chongqing Vietnam anywhere sane Asia. can't get visa all. government takes pride public health issues run benefit people instead corporations. capitalist societies government run ruling class serves benefit them.  Taiwan province, nation. defacto state characteristics De Jure quantifiers considered country. Even ROC never declared Taiwan independent country still believe they're ruler China. important make distinction province, Taiwan's covid-19 measures consistent Chinese provinces experience similar number cases low death counts.  deal company China, since early year, always plead stay home, wear mask etc...In plant workers must wear masks. Every one office must wear well. one person company 4000 people get covid since March. try getting people company wear masks get told fuck go cry corner. 2 guys got covid people told off, wont come work place needs sanitized. real...hypocrites. Obviously even number still way high happy with, IFR .65% deaths would around 1.72M. need exaggerate already-grim numbers. family member voted Biden, flying Florida Texas Thanksgiving Trump-supporting mom. people silly, regardless vote for.  Grinch really feel like making epidemic joke bad idea. enough deniers already they'll latch top things ""proof"" serious problem. That‚Äôs hard believe. I've never heard distilled quite manner, spot on. No. Testing tells whether detectable levels COVID moment tested. could pre-symptomatic; public health authorities advise waiting five days known exposure test earlier false negatives.

Think White House outbreak proof: testing every single visitor entered every time, many people still infected.

I‚Äôm going say you‚Äôre scum bag, traveling simply isn‚Äôt safe right now. Even negative test everyone, you‚Äôre putting family substantial amount risk. know that, that's remarkable. able obt executive order? Make America Fucked Ohio, gop governor encouraged worn masks since beginning. happened? party turned him. hardly lecture us part. experience taught anything people selfish, entitled assholes ashamed call neighbors. It‚Äôs funny westerners talk about, none true. Read what‚Äôs going right now, read alternative media, read latest election. stop pedaling Reddit clings onto Asian countries inferior white supremacy continue feed false dichotomy. Huh? Thank you! americans reap sow anyone going actually give advice mitigation call paranoid?? problem even 1m cases per day, they'd never know. testing infrastructure would support that.  enjoy working home social distancing assume everyone else earth Indubitable carnal fornication. everyone work...I'm predicting increase. predict greatest feast season leopards faces.

I really sad see it. already happening - lots people think/thought big deal going face grim reality actions.  takes time review likely thousands pages worth information. matter much, vaccine production still going anything ramped since readouts. Ohio? remember picking daughter Thursday. started developing symptoms Friday. running head: people proud wear masks see sign individuality. China mass monitoring everyone‚Äôs cell phones. Americans would never want that. Imagine contact tracing automated....  Relax mate. already witnessed Britain conducted past US behaving. Imagine citing *Donald Trump's twitter* though actual source. accurate using prove opposite true. Man remember started watching John Hopkins tracker like 10k cases whole world. remember pretty concerned US reached 3k total cases.   AH SHOOT expert endorses mean people still questions answered. safe need answer common concerns say ""im expert, trust me."" Agree. live portugal gyms still open. get check temperature. wear mask working desinfect equipment finished. still chance get corona there. opinion, carefull still catch, fated get it. lockdown, gym thing keeping mind right place. shut down, pretty shitty state mind while... feel like we're arguing like hobbits. 

Covid still elevensies us. Losing sense taste smell specific Covid. I'd definitely self isolate get tested ASAP. Please try inform contacts might past days well.  think people prefer WFH many us prefer person work. i‚Äôm adjunct instructor would never continue online forever  wanted fucked first time covered disappeared doctors/scientists read news tested every single person 4 cities already. That‚Äôs multiple millions test tens infections. get countries closed borders everything import/export goods feel sorry 260k lives lost, families medical workers front-line due pandemic measures politicised, plus constant BS receive people claimed virus hoax. 

US, supposed pinnacle leaders democracy, medicine education could saved people, fire Trump incompetence beginning? Can‚Äôt imagine nurse doctor shortage. /s

There someway flag people ignore medical guidelines plague refused care. Wal-Mart wanted enforcement without dedicated guards, probably include Mask Enforcement job description (in bold letters), potential hazards may apply. Happy report one pregnant here. actually reasonable post! Eureka Sorry think country was/is already pretty stuffed vaccine  way beyond fixable.

And make double! Tooth fairy Easter bunny also. one those... WEAR DAMN MASK! truly fascinating. Crohns lot biologics used immunosuppresants. inhibit TNF-alpha (Humira Remicade), IL-6 (Stelara), immune pathways commonly initiate inflammation. 

I believe Primary care physician told IBD patients therapies actually pretty well Covid-19. Sometimes better. started diving literature seems somewhat convincing. Seems like immunosuppressive ability therapies somehow reduce chronic lung inflammation cytokine storms seem wrecking havoc baseline immune function. 

More learn still considering high-risk. nice know may immediately kick bucket get sick. impression arguing take vaccine covered get covid bad reaction. Disagree, though definitely showed weaknesses system we‚Äôre united STATES. refused see things higher level perspective. soviet union also Team Team B right point collapse. insisted seeing things level dishing blame level. matters outcome squabbles led there.

However, currently HUGE issue area parents believe Covid care. send sick kids school believing proving Covid fake, deadly, helping herd immunity. parents problem throwing money solve it.

Are new internet? Misleading false comments everywhere. Europe get place? yep.....u part problem sure. glad dont live country! people fine. cancelled Thanksgiving Christmas months ago.

I dont get it. There's nothing special dates, plan family gathering June July. really shame capitalism failed us badly. economy works people, like Vietnam‚Äôs, hardly worry it. Skin color alleged law breaker. Europeans call Americans racist, defend way treat Romani people sub-human without shred irony. I'm betting figured they'd travel early beat rush, wait days get tested enjoy nice meal family. Since lots people still working home anyway matter state long log work prob burn vacation time either. 

The Phoenix airport gates jammed full people video saw news morning. We're supposed rolling in-airport testing Monday results 20mins. Even people pop positive, doubt they'd make changes plans. mention testing facility place weeks ago. logic literally never allows public life ever again. Viruses going anywhere.

Try again. garbage. mom aparently ‚Äúa sinus infection‚Äù won‚Äôt take temperature. don‚Äôt know hear sound banging fucking head wall 150 miles away.

I lost absolutely faith humanity. broken, vile, selfish species. spend half time thinking deserve whatever death get. necessarily. started feel bad Saturday night.

Maybe account testing, vaccine companies absolutely fucking marketing/messaging. safe make video addressing FAQ type common concerns? honest, today I've struggled. moments felt sad things look different girls year. Itll first Christmas able family's usual traditions. 

Other that... handling things okay. Thanks asking. you? stay safe, friend. Lol somebody idea talking about. Bill Gates written plenty code provide proof extraordinary claim hasnt. Get lost muppet. weird. dad previously taken humira psoriasis. He's currently taking stelaria today got letter stating insurance longer cover drug price.

I don‚Äôt know many people - Reddit - hard time accepting good news - maybe get pandemic quicker thought. Maybe it‚Äôs desire wrong, look like idiot ‚Äúthis going last *yearsss*‚Äù takes. actually miscalculated anyway, it‚Äôs 350k it‚Äôs 50 days away 2k per day, extra 100k people. üò¨ TBH think mods strike nice balance. sassy person, let tell you.

On topic. covid vaccine news absolutely great news, still reasons cautious. people use vaccine excuse give up, believe been, basically going lead disaster.

TLDR: Make sure get sick die winter vaccine available.^also ^no ^ban ^thx ^this ^helps ^keep ^me ^sane. Pfizer hand patient pill. Pfizer stabbing patient. 

Plans states called federal money. money allocated distributed. 

Who how?

Who / seen. That‚Äôs pretty universal. Hospital / EMT / assisted senior living first. spelled out.

What seem TBD, par course. Province Alberta land boarder crossing closed non essential travel Dec. 21 extended till

But want implement Also stay Alberta 14 days get tested 6-7 days 

But quarantine get test results initial test (you basically quarantine 1-2 days). means potentially spreading virus community day 3 day 8 (when get results second test day 6-7). know, realise thatt walt disney docs lemmings running cliffs sea staged now, anyone else see similarity here? written plenty anti china anti ccp articles, go spread bullshit somewhere else. real. Many (understandably) upset spread due Chinese New Year.... rescind card damn thing Thanksgiving (and probably Christmas) used two-three years stage 3 trial, months approval process. four months stage 3 trial + three weeks approval process EXTREMELY fast.

Still, me, healthcare community, seems slow. goons still love him. hope go crash weren‚Äôt mocking educated smarter Chinese people, mocking they‚Äôre racist emotionally mature 12 year old fucked lot Americans behaving, low-key think deserve it. America, whole, got lazy spent last decades living past glory little improve us. Infrastructure failing, science vilified, devolving us vs. us society. masses getting poorer, rich getting richer, long distraction many satisfied. feel like already fucked, people seeing now. Hopefully eyes opened future generations suffer way currently. please explain mean this? Yes, teacher here. Friday, March 13 last day. surreal. true Friday 13th. You‚Äôre right. Now, say climbers don‚Äôt risks shot attacked (with nowhere run they‚Äôre hanging pole) especially crazy 5G conspiracy theorists. 

But, amount human interaction EMT gets faaaaaaaar greater.

Thank you! headline bit fear mongering. 5 million Chinese traveled knew virus really was. Maybe 50 million Americans travel, many take precautions least know bit now. interesting see bad ends comparison. case we‚Äôre driving bf pup cabin mountains. stopping rest stops, seeing anyone. going hike relax week. Quarantining two weeks get back. medical infrastructure shit enough beds everyone isn‚Äôt profitable. also didn‚Äôt give people enough assistance stay home, like tons countries did. done enough, family safe, good job, sleep well People immune life get covid vaccines work enough people get certain timeframe.  Americans want that...it patriot act virus happen anywhere world, people interact animals time (think mink farms danmark). mutation occured animal that's capable transmitting disease animals humans, sooner later going jump humans. Mutation natural phenomenon one control, certainly one's fault happened. Pretty sure America's plan ""let fight profit selling weapons them"".  Marked calendar, thank you!

**County raises social distancing third-highest military S. Korea tighten coronavirus 60,000 take teacher exam despite virus 100% - I'm proud countries came together, hope start damage control January. society perfect (I personally hate France's liberal policies somewhat stifling, example) long move forward together recognize correct time discuss issues, win. I‚Äôve couple family members catch COVID neither spouses children got somehow. virus odd. Still statewide mask mandate Missouri... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hatred anything China end you. worth it? Look bright side!

We smell overflow rotting corpses streets Winter arrived. fence thanksgiving since already moms house weekly bc she‚Äôs primary babysitter. But, wife‚Äôs family coming positive Covid I‚Äôve working home watching kids past week. got tested see I‚Äôll come positive even don‚Äôt I‚Äôm opting thanksgiving moms side staying away two weeks know exposure date. Sucks need keep parents safe Online good many children, hybrid bad too. teachers go near kids. Kids socialize. Lunch class, talking. sharing paper, crayons, books, computers, etc. Everyone wears mask. sports, clubs, assemblies. good luck enforcing kids refuse wear masks social distance. 
Learning hates hybrid model ever. hundreds thousands students per building, logistics scheduling bussing becomes confusing nightmare. Online hard little kids special ed kids, hybrid alternative bad too, people think is. I‚Äôm RN. grocery store workers absolute heroes: feeding us providing staples, exposing cruelty clouds COVID-19. Bless them. I‚Äôm seen hero go peoples homes provide care, one family time. Grocery workers staring hundreds angry hordes face. Much thanks curses shitbags give bunch bullshit much needed jobs. Australia coming summer sitting 36 flu deaths 907 covid. 

Last year 700 flu deaths flu season. 

So yeah. ""hard learning"" - love it, I'll borrowing 204K cases yesterday. that's confirmed. telling actual case counts really are. predictions long takes get 300K/daily? Place bets. say 2-3 weeks..... comment removed shit. It‚Äôs nothing subcultures isolation. It‚Äôs like every sub culture hospital. real reason work frontline jobs esp since lot immigrants brown black EUA entire population, depends FDA says.

In case likely almost everybody, exception special groups, example pregnant women, children 5, etc. It‚Äôs like Fauci right everything wrong exactly. remember said virus doesn‚Äôt get contained could possibly hit 100k cases daily, yesterday hit 200k one seems care. Yes. anything, like TP, people would bought more. resold eBay exorbitant prices. 

Oh right anyways. Republic China, Taiwan, AKA Taiwan, nation. someone says Taiwan country, fact. US called America even though that's official nation. thing ROC, Taiwan. CoxHealth Mercy begun prepare extraordinary measure rationing acute critical healthcare event must. That‚Äôs doctors withhold treatment patients order treat others due scarcity resources. 

stay home. wear mask. wash hands.  
skip thansksgiving dinner year work public building massive restrooms. can‚Äôt help noticing things you‚Äôre every day. amount adults kids don‚Äôt wash hands truly, deeply appalling. Even now, 5 seconds water soap frequent. fairness, 18 hour flight. right would definitely increase everyone's chances. People eat drink flight long, means masks come off. 

Last time flew waited till people around finished eating till started eating. true, things back normal cities. Shanghai ‚Äúsmall‚Äù lockdown recently outbreak life generally normal USA = selfish people world I‚Äôve ‚Äúquarantined‚Äù since March! Lol! 

I want know best way get aersolized virus house! I‚Äôve disinfected surfaces touch I‚Äôve opened windows. It‚Äôs 2 hrs since unmasked repair guy left house. Also, 100 article showing masks work 1 article showing masks work make "" evidence support claims masks‚Äù . Um yeah, we're fucking dumb. course. time, dissapointed china spreading initially... thinking country wouldnt stupid right? Yeah no. Dumbass fucking politicians taking next level making political battle, one make prosper, well time people thought great one come bunch secrets say ""oh yeah it, pandemic people wouldnt realize doesnt matter"". year solidified absolute disgust country majority live within act worst ways possible. Fuck fellow Americans. Youve become thing claim hate. 360,000 cases. great, terrible.  definitely does. don‚Äôt like Australia‚Äôs current conservative government feeling would like UK way state premiers (like governors) came together pressured PM take COVID seriously.

Now state territories take part national cabinet PM coordinate Australia‚Äôs approach. pandemic time play partisan politics. Statistically, doesn‚Äôt China people America? haven‚Äôt dined all, shopped, gone gym visited friends last 10 days (the guidelines say 14, studies shown 10 likely enough), that‚Äôs great start. people can‚Äôt say honestly, you‚Äôre one folks can, you‚Äôre starting much lower risk profile.

In travel process, place likely catch COVID would indeed terminal flight. People around eating drinking masks removed, gate areas crowded, mask compliance isn‚Äôt 100%. Restrooms also high-risk. help reduce risk eating drinking airport, avoiding many queues can. Find remote area hide boarding. Get dropped front door trusted housemate, park close avoid shuttle buses, trains rideshare vehicles much possible - time enclosed vehicles adds risk.

Onboard also somewhat risky, course, counterintuitively might slightly lower terminal: planes HEPA filters exchange lot air altitude. minimize risk aloft declining food beverage wearing mask *entire* flight... highest risk times everyone else masks eat drink. Open vents seat create air curtain around you. Ideally, wear N95 KN95, fly airline that‚Äôs blocking middle seats like Delta Alaska. extra careful ground - airflow isn‚Äôt always working full blast like air.

If catch COVID, likely won‚Äôt aware infectious return home, point late protect family. won‚Äôt know precautions worked two weeks later...

If you‚Äôre going disregard public health guidance travel anyway - know probably - take many precautions get away with. Open windows gathering increased airflow, pop outside nice fire pit time. Don‚Äôt invite anyone 65. Stay least 6ft away everyone else, ideally 10ft. Wear masks can. guests use separate bathroom at-risk older people. Keep sleeping arrangements separate can. 

Some tools may - lets estimate relative risk various - lets estimate probability someone aircraft COVID infected based county. (Check airline seating capacity, use 75 100 reasonable guess)

Hopefully useful summary, may also find CDC‚Äôs Thanksgiving page helpful too:  followed protocols distance capacity, different gym's cardio room? I'm rarely early adopter comes new medicine, assessment I'm making:

1) vaccines seem safe, serious adverse effects, vaccines general good track record. unlikely cause harm. biggest question is, work? long effective? virus mutate, rendering vaccine ineffective?

2) Covid known adverse effects to, including, death.

I'll one first people line, soon available area demographic (forty-something underlying health conditions.) I'll continue isolate know effective circulating strains. don‚Äôt even deny said you. Must I‚Äôm right.  state health care first, elderly high risk, non medical essential workers people 30, adults 30, children difference one deliberate attack posed threat way living.


And virus temporary thing. provides long term effect. honestly think every major health organization planet lying right now, forget before, right mask recommendations, they're lying. 

For reason, exactly? Like they're trying get wear mask to... what? They're slaves big mask? put mind controlling chips thousands mask brands there? it? ulterior motive? What's gotcha? us didn‚Äôt vote Abbott suffering consequences - hate guy Except happen. Look typhoid Mary forced quarantine ER 6 beds. One nurse duty area covering 10+ communities 16k people. Thanksgiving Christmas regularly scheduled days people. easy getting whole families together. see mine every 2-3 years schedules distances. I‚Äôm definitely excited return office setting. I‚Äôve working remote nearly 2 years 6 months. It‚Äôs nice accomplished NEVER back seat thriving person environment. tested Full Celiac panel? thousand deaths 9/11, collectively lost minds spent trillions dollars years-long response. can't even agree 250,000 deaths justifies coordinated effort. Clearly cure elf blood That‚Äôs exactly normal gym setting though sure - think problem people like politicize everything, put everything... starts arguments adds wood fire. someone involved activism think headache, know combat sort feeling many millennials US feel strongly about. Misleading headline. 5 million people leave Wuhan Chinese New Year. Guidance definition recommendation. There‚Äôs nothing enforce. Again, relevant fact country managed control Covid well? I‚Äôm neighboring country, living Singapore would never go back home country. Every time topic Asian countries controlling Covid well, people throw words like authoritarian communism, helping countries much. Newsflash - isn‚Äôt. 

Now you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôm going go take dog walk lush greenery around government subsidized apartment block going breakfast McDonald‚Äôs. Turns vote really consequences Right. vaccine won‚Äôt help you‚Äôre dead longhauler it‚Äôs turn receive it. always people politicise anything shift blame someone else cover problems. Stating facts align political views seems trigger types reactions, can't bothered explain why.

I complete sympathy towards people US suffered highly politicised pandemic effort killed 260k people well BS continue receive claiming virus hoax. finally got 2nd lockdown Australia worked would worked much earlier enforced back April instead October. second this. issue (just) lack beds ventilators. issue lack trained staff. went Ikea dollar store today

The lady front waiting line screamed sheep standing 6 feet markers outside

And dollar store 4 separate people convo government bored COVID released kill old people people government doesnt like

I honestly wanted cry post removed because:

This post may appropriate Daily Discussion thread, stickied front page.


*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Pfizer estimated delivery numbers US end December 2020. I‚Äôve seen 50 million worldwide doses, people assume that‚Äôs US, it‚Äôs not.

I believe 25 million them, 2 dose regimen means 12.5 million people. Add Moderna‚Äôs projections 2 dose vaccine, rises 40 million people protected year‚Äôs end US. vaccine production continuing fast possible that.

US population 387 million, get 40 million vaccinated mid January that‚Äôs nice chunk, especially since vulnerable elderly medical staff first. understand think money would come from. Even happy less (I actually live modest life) would still need work avoid hunger homelessness. could go 3 months without work lose housing, I'd money groceries month last paycheck. Everyone needs work unless independently wealthy, lucky enough born one countries social safety net. 
I've work buy groceries pay housing since 16. continue work die. would amazing government help. can't even imagine parents willing buy groceries teenager, Europeans act like governments feed there! Amazing! 
Please diminish lives saying needs real needs.   slaves. society willing takes protect care nurses, maybe deserve them.  done half multiple occasions. still here. Even if, happenstance survive this, going next round don‚Äôt stop denying science. trend going long it‚Äôs going keep escalating deny science reality. people getting tested They're seflish people. see low risk decide problem. 1% sacrificed unlucky guess.  Bit stretch ""Good News"" tag  I'm always reading they're ""nearly full"" ""projected run out"". never read actually running out. don‚Äôt know later.

Sure .. means fraction even people become infected actually pass infection.

Any models done far worked assumption asymptomatic people infectious.

IF *not* true, modelling radically different.

Maybe explains models bad? think issue people traveling. need travel visit family, ""bubble."" planet civilization get better large amount old people die free resources everyone else. life live and/or throw away one else make choice them.

I say let em pie Implying Australians don‚Äôt live dense cities you‚Äôre isolated would purpose additional quarantine? smart ass question, curious. Many states indeed running ICU beds. reading aren't? fly landlord heartless decided end lease even tho paying rent. Chicago airport shoulder shoulder 1000s people caring all. quarantine hotel waited test results...all family harassed daily dramatic. Im losing faith people. way 250 number true talk 5 weeks restriction. infection map eastern part France nightmare. 

The infection map France changed dark blue 450+/100k 600+/100k 1000+/100k ? mean communes surrounding Lyon, Paris everything close Belgian/Dutch border.

What's white low density rural regions. 


TBH ""France lucky western part France hit hard"" Exactly. Friends sibling mump bringer, I‚Äôve told sibling falls line sort behaviour Mildly infuriating Let's see disappointed. Yeah inconveniences? optimism seems

He used phrase, ""gradual return"", Sept. speaking re: live events NY's Broadway Wow, that‚Äôs fucked  seed ideas grow anti-vaxx. idea pretty scary one. People think potential getting covid safer vaccine ""rushed"". fine skeptical, dangerous thought could turn people anti-vaxx without challenged. know! months since local hy-vee Fred Flintstone Limited Edition Ranch Bleu Cheese Bacon Brontosaur Pork Loins Adelaide lockdown lasted like 48 hours, reason even happened first place someone lied contracted it. Covid-19 flu. immune system routinely surprises us. severe cases Covid-19 seem driven immune processes. 

Everybody hopes nothing happens. can't say expert communicable diseases. Wherever find answers, avoid Facebook bane existence.

I say people loud opinions much bullshit pandemic is, surely first line...

... like Trump conservative politicians cool $150k stem cell implants cure virus...

... voted stem cell research. There's definitely kids asking santa cure/vaccine. lost first part though. Hope arrives time kiddos. would fly PANDEMIC?! Right? want comrade Joe ""Seize means"" Biden. sounds pretty rad compared Joe ""Nothing fundamentally change"" Biden. Hilarious...I know anti-USA circle-jerk strong Reddit damn that‚Äôs diluted...

If USA stopped buying cheap shit China collapse overnight. China could maintain artificial bubble growth (which maintains thin ice manipulation currency, autocratic control economy, completely lacks innovation relies stealing intellectual property, list goes on) without USA. simply could progress without US. 

The USA absolutely COULD continue trajectory without China. ‚Äúpivot India‚Äù viable strategy albeit pro/cons. Vietnam, Thailand, SE Asian countries already becoming attractive options. 

It remains seen China truly transition modern society. certainly isn‚Äôt embracing free speech assembly anytime soon. (such myself) would say populace develops big brother tightens grip sand slips fingers. remains seen Hong Kong major issues play world stage. mention if/when pandemic ends world perceive China relationship it. 

You call China ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù comical. China cares China first, foremost, ONLY. Locking Wuhan allowing international flights really speaks mindset. 

The USA ‚Äúaddicted projecting force‚Äù kept many wolves bay lifetime. USA done bad stuff (particularly Latin America) fighting communism, facial, oppression still cause many see noble however flawed may be. 

Don‚Äôt think China isn‚Äôt looking project force want go ""Grimstone"" lately, seems treated like 'Pre-Christmas' anything else. Costco loaded christmas-y plants decorative centerpiece things right flying shelves. Man fucking dumb understand difference interactions grocery store interactions bar. Everything different. useless comparison made. Swell job. it‚Äôs one days Americans see families. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs reason. Americans don‚Äôt get many days off. shouldn‚Äôt downvoted, time you‚Äôre inside people run risk getting it. 

It‚Äôs obviously much higher you‚Äôre meal spending time closer proximity people, it‚Äôs like stops contagious simply you‚Äôre picking vegetables whatever starting vulnerable staying healthcare workers, vulnerable. Technically 1% us fucked. Ohh anyone healthcare industry fucked well. Thank service! Due triggered emotions Reddit respond comments Depends live maybe? got one Friday results back less 24 hrs. Ring around rosie

Pocket full posies

Ashes ashes

We fall down! Holy shit heard shit like 8 weeks ago said Sweden see rise deaths rest Europe downvoted. guys learn... Deaths lagging indicator. Agreed. elementary school child actively depressed going virtual school end school year last year beginning year. someone work home, saw first hand I‚Äôd conference call bedroom door shut would get call walk kitchen find 9am front TV. asked ‚Äúwhat doing?‚Äù said ‚ÄúI break‚Äù. said ‚Äúwhen break till?‚Äù said ‚ÄúI get back computer 11‚Äù. jaw hit ground. school board allowed option brick mortar online, talked explained experience class would different socially distant desks, strict rules, wear mask, playgrounds, etc. matter seconds enthusiastically said wanted go back school person. 1 day going different kid personality wise lights talking school now. She‚Äôs back brick mortar 2+ months it‚Äôs best decision her. could literally watch stagnate regress abysmal virtual offering. fair, virtual school curriculum isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs complete lack structure lack school environment bad. believe that‚Äôs virtual school work older kids (I partial online master‚Äôs degree) student already understands necessary structure environment isn‚Äôt necessary. I‚Äôm glad least got Brad Pitt SNL wish. deserves sort Brad Pitt exclusivity agreement lol. current rate deaths per day we'll break 400k end January use apples apples point using misleading statistics try prove point. Relax. Well, guess we're releasing Cyberpunk 2077 hope people stay home much possible throughout winter. ... still first wave gotcha. think rush whoever gets first gets contracts &amp; therefore makes profit. Idk, maybe there's altruistic reasons well, seems like profit probably driving motivator quickness. Simple solution: ask patients believe covid real, toss em not. 

Evil, maybe. people likely brought themselves. wearing masks, going pubic events, etc. fair people spread virus denied medical care. Plus, know, Darwin. Seriously lmao. ""Biden socialist wants make america socialist turn away Christian family values!"" 

Please, keep going, like I'm reading correct answer. need go store, place inside essential reason, dentist, doctor, go first thing open. There's less chance air contamination customers/patients/employees. good decided lock thought uncontrolled spread? Even though lie took hard line measure truth found, told public truth lie worth it. Much better Trumpian era. Yep, deaths going exceed 3,000 per day winter Capitalism kills. People wearing masks makes oligarchs money, people wearing masks gets way people making money. It‚Äôs fuckin omnishambles WoW healer, tank, 3 dps 5-man dungeon. Raids usually 2 tanks, healers vary fight raid size, rest dps.

Whenever switched tanking healing, still watch raid frames everything else going on, like healing. also get yelled same. difference can't necessarily save people things go south. 

Never played Overwatch. mom kinda shutdown online gaming could do, played WoW years either. first time never imagine. Yes also we're dumb. always thought ironic health care workers get laid pandemic unintended consequence overwhelmed health care system make room covid patients. husband happens medical specialty still needs function covid, including treating covid patients. one hand he‚Äôs taking small risk time walks hospital, hand, there‚Äôs dark humor aspect there‚Äôs job security him.
I hope two find something local hospitals, even it‚Äôs temporary. health care workers still needed many places. Unfortunately I‚Äôm northern Indiana I‚Äôve looked within hour radius, couldn‚Äôt find anything sooner appointment I‚Äôve made. island, Hawaii then? They‚Äôre road Marxist revolution, grip capital weakened places. Consumerism exceptionalism aren‚Äôt inherent immovable traits people USA UK, they‚Äôre traits conditioned encouraged capitalism. Imagine virus even lethal even worse symptoms. still people fight ''mask tyranny''. still risk, greatly reduced risk.

Tests aren‚Äôt perfect it‚Äôs also possible get infected taking test.

The foolproof mechanism full quarantine 14 days tests middle, countries doing. Even rare case slips by.

I totally understand though. Saturdays Mondays typically line seven day moving average. Sunday low day. Success stories - now. re-open borders point. force vaccinate population so? Maybe, maybe not, see.

(I one, btw.) Nobody talking support seen talk it. Snowden overestimated intelligence long-term memory caoabilities countrymen. sacrifice completed wasted America. think definitely part it. capitalistic system know. built weak foundation microscopic virus caused collapse. it‚Äôs falling apart, really pull bootstraps survive hardship, ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù people idea function. it. O'hare airport news filled people traveling Illinois

Not like state experiencing exponential growth cases hospitals capacity..... Honestly summer seem far away obvious whole avoid people stay inside thing fucking work.

It's quite obvious does? Go look country. Look Victoria. shit work 99% people part like America. Fight attendants? 15 minutes threshold include sitting nearby ‚Äúclose contacts‚Äù. 

21 cases leading 5 like 0.25 rt. That‚Äôs incredibly low. dont keep sucking corporate dick Let's fair. Contact tracing US pretty big failure general. people trying, contract tracing useful widespread community spread, pretty much whole time. Springfield Missouri people cheering govt 9/11 much freedom legit taken away. testing gene sequencing virus. Thanks source joke - honestly hard tell who‚Äôs serious nowadays Replace ‚ÄúChina‚Äù ‚ÄúFox News‚Äù government allows air travel...who's fault here? work dog boarding kennel 100 dogs next week. People definitely give shit here. covid hoax still.... gave friend that. sooner people accept fact Xmas cancelled, better.  dude try school socialism. 

yes - 'capitalist' countries better better social safety nets road marism - fuck, could make case Vietnam either.

The thing seems common failed countries rampant consumerism exceptionalism. Basically, everyone USA wants party everyone UK wanted go holiday Spain summer. China brought matches, Trump spread, continues spreading gasoline. Yeah fucked. everything I'm supposed continue so.

Yall fun playing Russian Roulette there. local Albertsons tried ""seniors hours"" times, many showed up. could also depend day. Sunday, Monday Friday mornings 6am quite devoid. course another variable could respective paydays. I'm paid weekly job, suspect typical ""1st month"" would also equate larger crowd hours couple days. right, maybe consider regulating driving automotive industry. 

Oh wait... make political reddit incredibly biased sense ppl either kids, students white collar workers fall liberal mindsets anything. current liberal rhetoric businesses evil, shutdowns good, stay home else kill people, ok open schools. I'm hating specifically since right wing attitude faults well (particularly US). contact tracing Southern Nevada. hiring organizations help. It‚Äôs still slow going, we‚Äôre generally behind 2 days, also use deloitte calls contacts. It‚Äôs still overwhelming time, we‚Äôre working hard says 10%? Gesundheitsamt

ah-choo


^^^^^sorry :( confused correlation covid motorcycle. trump handled it. turned US vs political argument heighten emotional state base. fault. Yes it‚Äôs bad headline. Times like I'm grateful social circle naturally less group 10 people. joke, Thanksgiving going 5 us. 

Cornish hens instead full Turkey. Less waste. Less sharing utensils. Easier stomach. fucking stupid  post satire, good. alluding becomes available, countries governments may likely push it. US people fight tooth nail get looking leaderboard upside down. *literally* ask anything. Check replying to.

Regardless, meant saying ""look, Trump said it"" prove true. Executive orders force law sheriffs deciding do. competent honest investigate anything? removed. nothing we're options!

Haha apparently üòÇ new roommate moved NJ place Waterloo region, Ontario. drove. issues crossing border, told moving post-doctorate university Waterloo (truth, is) let right without issues. stayed hotel 2 weeks moving place. Especially you‚Äôre planning outside particular group. It‚Äôs deadly everyone. Hate say it

And return home stay away everyone else, right? everyone still seem insist personal decision everyone decide risk level is? Instead everyone trying figure much get away with, asking help others stop spreading virus. Even travel family ok it, go activities Thanksgiving. odds people like perfectly willing take risk end taking risks areas probably less cautious be. means end giving others might vulnerable taking precautions protect families. See decisions go beyond chose themselves? 1st wave. number skyrocketing. I'm sorry, live nearby town thought helpful least one person reading article start taking seriously before, would worth it. least guys shut borders.

Flights today tomorrow saw many people voted Trump month part kinda sat back thought, welp, Americans deserve everything happens us. know virus started around November 2019? know China admitted 2020. math smart guy. Infections started way February. Well, I'm good. places since pandemic began. course, I'm still unemployed nine months lose unemployment payments day Christmas, playing rules done shit me. I'll keep wearing mask avoiding others, pretty infuriating. one people. employer decided bring everyone back office felt horrible knowing I'm risk get covid daily yet either possible tabboo take part regular pleasures used (socializing person, working gym, etc). think would mentally lost decided keep without taking part pleasures quit job (a luxury many ppl ofc). 

At first seeing governor's / premiers get TV supporting stopping thread nice think us it. government wants better signal people, using real people working everyday. encourage positive reinforcement. Socializing ok , emphasize outdoor things wear mask. Wear masks let u see faces bothers u. Find outlets like video games bond ur friends families. Positive signalling much potential told 'folks need stay home unless ur going work, sending ur kids school. fault'.

The irony I'm introvert. Extroverts lost long time ago like June throwing parties , travelling country everything. Yeah that‚Äôs loooong time. got October I‚Äôd rather take route. get damn thing you‚Äôre healthy.

Next week, may last weeks Sad thing people thread, despite criticizing others so, also traveling.  Charlotte flying home days ago. Absolutely nightmare. job construction management requires travel we're ""essential"" somewhat possible distance, airlines airports encouraging travel COVID damned. They'll sacrifice everyone profits. two realities here. one reality, one group people denying reality.  Dude same, same. I‚Äôve began lose faith pretty much every system currently place this. Personally it‚Äôs getting point think even democracy mistake. People stupid handle correctly. can‚Äôt go Lowe‚Äôs. sick March went seeing people wearing masks triggered anxiety. would say 1/3 doesn‚Äôt wear 1/3 wears nose. keep seeing comments people justifying travel plans saying they‚Äôre getting tested leave. How? exposed two weeks ago every place called around refusing testing without symptoms. Told quarantine that‚Äôs it. Luckily didn‚Äôt get asymptomatic see wasted tests dumb reasons people actually exposed can‚Äôt get tested. Christmas without doubt gonna biggest spike Coronavirus cases around world. attitude ""It's Christmas! make exception"" majority. matter Sally COVID hugged 80 year old gran killed week later. cracking Christmas matters, family!... controlling now. Let‚Äôs get lives back track there's vaccine, still antivax crowd. rip Rock roll baby It‚Äôs overwhelming year. Awful flu adults rsv last fall early winter. covid. Prone prone prone. Ards ards ards. People acting way they‚Äôve taught act. order community solve problem, people within ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù must see *in* community. Americans, least enough Americans make covid huge disaster, taught accept idea largely atomized actors. taught see LLCs basically, best minimal relationships family - even mostly making feel good (hence popularity cutting called ‚Äútoxic‚Äù family members). people atomized normal life, disconnected sense community concern well others, disease (which see dangerous personal level) different? Ideology serious consequences.

Being mad people selfish seems bizarre gussied selfishness often presented virtue, traditional sources community insulted objects scorn. know, that's always fantasy, sick twisted interpretation lol Italy centralized federal government?  possible indeed....  Remember asked America crowd fund transition Twitter? Good times Many congrats you!! inside store since March. order pick groceries. take cat vet, made arrangements drop him, pick afterwards. plan things, go contact everything. renew drivers license July, go that, trying minimize contact. # FREEDOM forget general cultural differences. Collectivism dirty word US extention 'caring fellow man' stupid. 

Americans understanding authority toddler, 'tyranny someone tells something'. Yep, We're 4% population already virus, likely much more. think fair say 8-10% coronavirus, since first wave little testing. Although, number nowhere close herd immunity champion him, figure there's always much viewpoint Vs viewpoint rhetoric world. intent pulls someone else's viewpoint back little.

I think true humanitarian means impact. going live unbalanced society, I'm glad someone like winning chair. local officials poster replied referring. later sacked roles cover up. Yeah, someone else mentioned above. bit shocked. realize Friday Thanksgiving busy day. that's encouraging! Oh get high horse something instead blame people proposed lack intelligence. much lube prepared purchase? Every year. 

What Phoenix in? People travelling Thanksgiving: ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt happen me!‚Äù

People buying lottery tickets: ‚ÄúHey, ya never know!‚Äù voted laying hard truths. makes people angry. want accept reality.

Keep going. ü§ò Incorrect. I, immune compromised individual, still go minor things local community. option ""just stay inside"". attempt grow little empathy? empathy difficult? Legit question I've wondering while: licking fingers worse eating takeout food? eat food get infected, licking fingers different? understand touching eyes transfer via eyes such...  Sorry can't afford Christmas year kids, mom hospital sick (might die) can't afford year ): good person. Thank you. won‚Äôt alone year. tiny immediate family 3 thinking others like same. We‚Äôre fucked know people carry again/spread others they've already? That's things become unclear me. It‚Äôs ok, there‚Äôs 12 million cases it‚Äôs like 50 million people bad /s doesn‚Äôt seem realize rationale, anyone could claim COVID get wearing mask. We're still babysitting brother sister-in-law's kids, they're covid bubble, they'll travelling (a short distance) visit us thanksgiving. It'll still less half size normal holiday gathering though. Y‚Äôall fucked one gives shit bullshit anymore

No, we're ""fucked"" people like understand cases rise hospital capacity rises going cause greater problems form increased deaths.

We're *also* ""fucked"" people like care little fellow Americans (and fellow humans *in general*) decided lives unimportant worth protecting/saving.

But know arguments flawed come across hateful towards others make comments throwaway. perhaps nod throwing away future case find throwing away future mean others okay others lack concern others' future. capitalism. freedom speech allows people spread misinformation distrust science. travel? There's chart case increase looks like [this recent (which worth read). sadly looks really bad. probably record high caseload days Sweden's future. :( Yes. Alabama beat Kentucky 63-3. Almost Al.com articles football. virus. man...people worried Thanksgiving next month going actual bloodbath. hate snarky disingenuous ""hMm CuRiOuS"" comments assuming they're actually personally affected 180'd based bad numbers state wide. Either way I'm happy they're finally following protocol we've followed long time. living Japan. recommend June country opens tourism April thought. I'd go September, case Olympics held all. That‚Äôs 2.5m last year, day. 10% way pessimistic like reduction well strict measures put place little notice I‚Äôm surprised see people force first afternoon restrictions lifted.

There‚Äôs also going sense complacency well state suppress cluster. 

Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre woods yet people are, it‚Äôs definitely looking promising Melbourne situation, infinitely better anything they‚Äôre crapping US. accept death hospital beds full one hand, see it. hand, think false dichotomy. 

We eat, drink, otherwise exposed great number chemicals daily basis less studied vaccines. that's often reasons convenience complacence. vaccines much necessary, much tested things. 

I mean, ever eaten piece fruit soap scrub yourself, probably consumed Roundup, well know bad effects. public get scared enough IMO put stop things like that, still overly wary something far safer beneficial. someone traveling, pain. decided drive 900 miles instead flying it, get COVID tests, we‚Äôre specifically booking place nobody while. TOUGH, hope travelers careful us week election, got hair cut Texas Cuban immigrant. absolutely convinced headed path Castro Chavez Biden. tried offer reassurance ask particular seen worried. seemed like 100% political fear mongering really taken hold.

Good NM. Meanwhile governor said lockdowns, passed 1M deaths even California did, despite larger population ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Human rights violations don‚Äôt mean shit you‚Äôve got good infrastructure. Political prisoners sure good hard labor. Yes LET TRACK SETTINGS! tired winning yet?!? Stop comparing driving risk. I'm downplaying benefit isolation testing masks, compare driving implies risk people involved. reality people getting infected screwing entire country result. Car crashes contagious.  It‚Äôs ironic person Florida got covid already terrible time lingering symptoms still months later. 

But yeah, gf much fed point too. Everyone shits China, think absent respective governments, Chinese citizens better Americans. No. I'm not. I'm saying due inaction, I'm indifferent deaths continually ignore, act direct defiance of, science. I'm wishing death, I'm taking action make die. 


I remember younger touted right wing ""facts feelings"" calling card, embarrassing see childish many are. might fall study... link bottom Exactly. I'd wager amount Nebraska fine money collected somewhat less $15. think confused. person responded offended someone referred ""needing"" work quotation marks believe working essential life. *They* think need. not. pointed countries obvious need.

My point need.

Also, vote me? That's petty, friend.  Funny say that. Tsunamis one wave, tons people die come back first wave hit second. Also, supposedly Walmart started limiting number people allowed stores again, went last weekend, one counting people coming in... totally acceptable people go protest BLM 

It totally acceptable go cheer streets biden 

It unacceptable go Thanksgiving family. 

Piss 

Where we're 538 articles articles happening. probably existing lines coordination Trump org foreign agents. Jr rejected secret service protection reason. Americans spoiled brats rich parents never taught discipline. medical system big fuck American people. get sick already know there's point going doctor dollar every time someone justified rationalized vacation since pandemic, I‚Äôd ballin like Bill Gates. ? holiday season America could hit herd immunity vaccine delivered significant portion population. Conversely, 1/15th people Chicago coronavirus likely engaged higher risk activities forms social gathering. People taking precautions likely travel right now. Meaning cohort people airport probably likely ‚Äúrisk-taking‚Äù, may higher proportion average population infected people. 

Combine outcomes, answer ‚Äúsome people covid.‚Äù Haha. Whether two things cancel anybody‚Äôs guess. justify Australian then? Taiwan? South Korea? stronger democracies US lol, look shit we're going through. Either massive election fraud, President attempting shitty coup. Either way, democracy looking real weak right compared Australia. neighbours denied existed came talk them? Taiwan's efficiency responding COVID nothing province though. left completely given support, simply implemented right measures (including banning Chinese people going Taiwan). 

Also, figures mentioned result PRC pressuring rest world, much powerful. work healthcare new protocols include anyone 90 days past positive test must tested. Last week positive test past need tested. Everyone tested negative gets weekly testing. get reinfected aren‚Äôt ‚Äúchampioning‚Äù him? He‚Äôs donated $45 billion dollars helped saved thousands upon thousands(if millions) lives. absolutely championed. Fuckity fucked up!! American resigned getting made peace banking contagious viruses generally, evolutionary trend towards becoming less virulent, immune system Corona viruses circulate, adaptive response. herd immunity future cases less severe. mothers husband, brother, father, two cousins niece contracted last three weeks other. mild symptoms around four days got better father needed go hospital one say 70 40 year alcoholic diabetic. strain seemed weak, here‚Äôs hoping! I'm confused, husband started showing symptoms Monday (I guess Sunday technically tell Monday) got tested Tuesday we've separated since then, he's basement. wear masks comes first floor. He's symptoms (fever, coughing, runny nose, congestion, loss taste, body aches) test came back negative, mine. really symptoms, except sore throat body aches. still isolate? Lol, want exactly. disagree says dumb shit, think would prevented this. Blame whoever want dude, rona around world. Expand horizons beyond 'trump bad"" giga fucked I‚Äôd like see reactions someone claimed gays unprotected sex selfish morons. They‚Äôd outraged rightly so. Oh, ok. thought testing totally funded state federal government? exactly believe insurance companies would foot bill millions Covid tests goodness hearts. post covid landlord. felt like provide good reason fly essay landlord. landlord legal rights. lease ended keep saying history books ultimately look back blame American people COVID spread well closing businesses. 

The American people ones partying, protesting, gatherings, refusing stop Thanksgiving travel. coincidence new infections happening 2 weeks Halloween. 

This Nazi Germany, anti-COVID gestapo. Donald Trump, governors, county health officials, mayors can't send police private house stop Thanksgiving parties. Freedom means responsibility- American people bad job freedom prevent COVID spread. 

There much news serious Chinese New Year's China, cases far lower today's cases US. much news Thanksgiving. Yah sorry, proudly continue going gym frequent basis. fact go gym puts position I‚Äôm really worried catching covid begin with. Muh freedoms. lot friends mostly good isolating generally responsible, making plans travel Thanksgiving. upsets much don‚Äôt even know talk them. One said going visit parents since knows Christmas like. least way she‚Äôll see one holidays. She‚Äôs seen family least couple times since March. am, hunkered plans absolutely anything foreseeable future. haven‚Äôt seen parents since March. Thankfully work home. blows mind kind attitude. I‚Äôm getting worked thinking now. ever Abbott's name spoken, always mention Lt Gov Dan 'murder grandmother' Patrick. rule remind us selfishness leaders. Lmao. got downvoted people claim ""listen science."" Bunch speds here. funny part OP typed hoping get bunch fake internet points  distant observer think best thing Dr Fauci could country time resign job go work Joe Biden.
He's far constrained official position message often muted, far forthright assertive without current shackles right support around him.
He's national treasure rightly say he's humble man, maybe humble current climate time short there's none waste. doc says naturemade whatever big brand one yellow top garbage. recommended OH HUMANITY lmao fucking snowflake. walk dog inside worst example come with, I'm sad bro. God happy county going soft lockdown, working home come Tuesday since offices limited 10%. Happy happening people potentially travel Thanksgiving home spike likely Christmas spike well Oof, that‚Äôs equivalent 40k Spain France Bread lines capitalist America...again. water wet. Learned Stop Worrying Love Virus?  Nup, official CDC stats. Exponential growth mutation suppose. want bill insurance. uninsured, would completely free. lunches never 5 dollars, HCL area. US ""win"" Korean War ""won"" WW2 Soviets softened Germans 10 million bodies. causal link it‚Äôs strong enough sue cigarette company getting cancer. still exceptions like Bernie, unfortunately exception proves rule... Also Baltimore dad visiting NY (driving). work home tested negative. dad Thanksgiving together long time. hope guys good time. Thanksgiving cautious/safe. Yeah. It‚Äôs pretty much orders food drive thru tho. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll 3 Big Macs, 2 large fries vanilla shake‚Äù. Yup. I‚Äôm fully preparing Jan worst numbers. Pizza turkey sausage still counts Thanksgiving dinner!! Haha rip Kate Winslet I‚Äôm annoyed people right now. Staying home one season really hard. ""There Republican Congress."" seen friends since march. plan ever seeing unless clears up. Getting ""sick it"" excuse selfish prick. ""Nearly billion people traveled air, 44 cases COVID linked direct transmission plane"" --Some Guy, house, videoconference.

The cases skyrocketing now, wait couple weeks Thanksgiving. Imagine many preventable deaths occurred Christmas.

Best luck people. Smart. Stay Healthy. Stay Safe. Well, pretty much everybody thought Spanish flu came Spain. history repeated 100 years. It‚Äôs favorite movie mine years naively found morbidly excited life imitating art that‚Äôs happened year don‚Äôt think ever watch movie ever again. almost like issue nuanced generalizing 330 million people makes look like idiot. embarassing ask source? I'd hate English teacher.

did say know Li Keqiang was? claiming said things say?

Anyhow, refering disposable income, total income, preceding statement referred 30k RMB disposable income per capita, also 'per worker', population also includes babies, retired, sick, etc.

and noticed retreated statement regarding 'hundreds millions left'.

it's OK accept made factual error, Trump. Especially Vegas seems closest exit mile away. air nowhere go Part hopes world doesn‚Äôt let thing go back normal Americans. want fuck around create trouble entire world, probably shouldn‚Äôt right travel live abroad without harsh scrutiny. entire world took seriously, US turned game. time embarrassed American. me, motherfucker. know anyone traveling. even ones travel lot. Weird think it, good weird!! Kinsa like degeneration x? It‚Äôs understandable she‚Äôs disappointed (and somewhat denial), still - health important feelings. spouse tell wants throw y‚Äôall baby shower, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll lol. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre wrong unless allow settings (I know Apple) won‚Äôt showing exposure info. China doesn‚Äôt care. China also consequences quarantining. governors saying oh there‚Äôs curfew local police say won‚Äôt enforcing curfew. countries Asia mass testing. places need take 2 hours day get tested many places won‚Äôt free without insurance. get tested regularly work. get tested like places (only college campuses), normal work place good luck. America set contain. America set politicize. 


Also idk curfew achieve. People getting covid 10pm 5am. People getting covid work. People getting covid thanksgiving travel bring home travel work. bad shit show winter... r word considered insulting applied people. phrase people use know developmentally disabled. thought past one now...  Greatest country world btw literally said failure leaders yeah Australian Government introduced Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment workers coronavirus. available eligible workers six Australian states. payment available workers  don‚Äôt paid sick leave can‚Äôt earn income self-isolate quarantine due positive coronavirus case,  caring someone coronavirus.

I pointing this. using thread shit USA? Oh, please. risk catching COVID Thanksgiving dying probably lower risk dying car accident way there. *How many vacation homes earned America spiraling control now...

Has POTUS attempted anything since trying falsely declare victory? Wtf plan here?

When vaccine drops everyone already divided masks convinced virus even exist... Shut scary. spread like wild fire. hell talking about? Reuteurs Article- ""Italian researchers told Reuters March reported higher usual number cases severe pneumonia flu Lombardy last quarter 2019 sign new coronavirus might circulated earlier previously thought."" spreading didnt know Covid yet. Holy shit edge sharp. I'm genuinely curious Fox classified terrorist support organization lose broadcast permit.

Would interesting one day week CNN go full Fox News far distance left. conscience, guilt, full Bat-Shit Crazy. (KVRR)¬† ‚Äì Sanford Health released statement following email CEO Kelby Krabbenhoft wrote Sanford employees **wearing mask COVID-19 ‚Äúwould merely show,‚Äù**  told employees recovered COVID-19 back office without mask. Yes. I'm genuinely sorry hear like that.

You must hundreds millions well-intentioned folk trying right thing, undermined selfish 10% aren't.

Let's hope 2021 brings better tidings. Washington here, exactly we're giving blankets time. Ugh... people losing vaccines come online. could understand people giving truly end sight saying fuck it. we're literally weeks away beginning end Covid... we're going absolutely brutal winter.
 
What. the. fuck. think us March babies getting birthday 2021 :( request military needed Maybe spike turkeys vaccine!!!! N95 + mask + goggles. Tbf, lot easier clamp state lower population density Wyoming, whole nation lower density North Dakota. Also, island, controlling dummies come lot easier.

The US controlling anything nationally, states open other, even ones trying getting fucked ones Trumped. 70 million people stupid fuck. Honestly, feel that. mentioned long ago nervous would find reason delay vaccine called conspiracy theorist. point I‚Äôll believe see it. Ohhhhh. Yeah work stand-alone, satellite ED. Like, it‚Äôs connected anything. It‚Äôs 7 ED beds. maintenance one guy travels sites need anything. 10 associated 2 hospitals, EDs need hospital full funnel patients build satellite EDs. think it‚Äôs good backup tho (ct/x-ray), doctor, two nurses sometimes ED tech. respiratory really anyone ask help like maintenance security, besides one registration girl.

Sucks understaffed! hope guys stay safe try get run down! pandemic began little faith fellow Americans since opinion worsened. Bingo. bunch things help reduce rate transmission, even none actions completely eliminate transmission, still better we‚Äôd done nothing. people partake helpful imperfect efforts, better effect. See, example, cloth masks. Well maybe partially.  real answer moving Mars! Fuck people even make irresponsible decision go see family fucking drive, grab pairs gloves use places like gas station outside long distances plan around trying make one day staying hotel, shit probably safer go hotel route sitting metal tube people packed around you. Bill Gates shut fuck stop fishing Nobel peace prize.

Yes, he's good. he's rich large part leveraged Microsoft's monopoly suppress competition (and innovation), causing prices customers higher been. Yes, stealing little money lot people -- dramatic big bank heist -- stealing nonetheless. stole wallet donated money cause *in name*, rightfully pissed: that's exactly Bill Gates done. oh shit lol NZ AUs also followed Asian model. would need suspend constitution US order implement half that. 

From governance standpoint, commonwealth countries parliamentary system.

Whereas US full-presidential republic constitution. Many people don‚Äôt realize US unique G7 OECD country system. constitution law land. 

Once suspend reason, bets table.

So closing, think implementing total response would trouble worth. fact is, large population, could afford screw early days, did. crucial moments. Seems totally reasonable me. somehow get test beforehand, even better. isolating 14 days seeing someone thanksgiving, would taken test last week. We're 7 days people this. people decorate yards inflatable santa reindeer suddenly yelling religious freedumb I'm completely this. government care whatsoever, half population self centered stupid. Thank :) Almost nothing would kill point. shut whole country real stay home orders long time ago. People turned soft anti vaccine, partly political. I'll take vaccine soon available It‚Äôs gonna 6 months so. worth it. Without end close I‚Äôd understand it. 21 pounds? Sounds sus let's keep watch person large gathering!!! Noted 5 million people left Wuhan Chinese New Year unaware social distancing, masks, safety measures. 50 million Americans much aware ready handle holiday. ‚ÄúSlams‚Äù little hyperbolic. comparison states, Georgia relatively okay Well, died already. probably would've died next years though.  article: 

Officials warned unless number infections drops substantially, may raise level social distancing regulations.

On Saturday, KDCA official said country ‚Äúa critical juncture‚Äù could facing large nationwide outbreak surpasses two earlier waves infections, fails block current spread. I‚Äôm going lie say enjoy wearing mask. come on, wearing one really big deal? feel like people digging heels sake it. Oh, Jesus. embarrassing. know is? Seriously?

Here's [full transcript speech](http://english.www.gov.cn/premier/news/202005/29/content_WS5ed058d2c6d0b3f0e9498f21.html). Feel free read it. get paid douchebag something makes feel like life meaning?  Seems pretty suspect one dude could kept entire rest Trump administration dark COVID month two. worst part surging Thanksgiving, going huge amount transmission everyone travels. People mingle infect others get infected go back home infect household. estimate somewhere around doubling daily rates. Knowing came helps knowing humans got it. start Italy, we've looking (and blaming) wrong animals people.  Exactly. won‚Äôt affect Covid-19 patients. whole system swamped ambulance/EMT way morgue. heart attack survivable year ago could kill now. Maybe EMT took long get you. Maybe weren‚Äôt enough staff ER get code timely manner. Covid-19 isn‚Äôt kind hearts. Maybe could saved emergency cardiac surgery, surgeons staff stretched far thin. maybe cardiac surgeon needed fighting life case Covid-19. Give money unemployed still things would change. pay bills I‚Äôd going work rather worrying spreading it. feel many people feel way well won‚Äôt honest dare adult understand sick act accordingly. /s

Fucking people acting like two people near cause COVID. Again. don‚Äôt mean everyone. mean non-essential. don‚Äôt need bureaucrat determining is. Always easy spend people‚Äôs money, AOC. original next time. Cleverness highly underrated elderly vaccinated Jan/Fen, March shall see deaths hopefully India 133k deaths one better performers world wide. think know numbers work. Thats intense hope everybody stays healthy, especially kids I've zero flu URTIs winter. hygiene measures social distancing kept far healthier would normally been. sarcastic, wish knew fucking charismatic awesome people's families they're desperate hang them.

Even family members like kinda okay. makes things even worse. household single ""middle class worker"" would almost definitely fall 1000 yuan/month per capita.

And think people countryside working fields small shops earning wage? earn whatever sell. Minimum wage apply them.

When last time rural China? comment would benefit including data/facts support position. Nature Yes, point that, covid ubiquitous now, America absolutely contact tracing. completely impossible prove gave you; since can't demonstrate first person spread work was. 

Similarly, smoking cause lung cancer shit ton complicated factors lead cancer developing difficult prove caused cancer. Trump fired people responsible ranking us #1 pandemic preparedness, people forgotten that? fly months ago due family emergency... person front noon flight ordered 2 beers. Like really? Afternoon flight middle pandemic need take mask drink fucking Heinekens? We‚Äôve got redneck sheriff Ohio who‚Äôs declared he‚Äôs enforcing governors orders mandate either masks curfew now. country headed chaos disintegration sheer fucking stupidity. say can't wait subreddit longer major purpose, much love subreddit, I'll relieved pandemic subsides. still cases around, bad probably time next year hear permanent ""new normal""  really enjoyed reading reply , thank . look New Zealand Utopia . countries leader intelligent compassionate. federal leader religious lazy buffoon state leader best , refused bow federal pressure lockdown instead listened doctors scientists that‚Äôs day 23 cases deaths ( affectionately called double doughnuts üç©üç©) Anyway hope get move NZ good life long virus makes back china americans? one saying started there, present September. interconnected world is, could started anywhere.

The article little misleading.

Check sources someone else posted. Yeah communists spread germs, capitalists.

/s Yes, trust US numbers unlike many edgy Redditors.

You literally look excess deaths see US numbers 30%. hey, basic numeracy edgy something guess. Mate saying good compared rest world isn‚Äôt normal. I‚Äôm glad done. Well ok tbh haven‚Äôt followed development English usage slurs closely. don‚Äôt know heard U.K. used relatively commonly, racial slurs nobody would use them.

Nvm, I‚Äôll delete. Definitely photoshop mean 30 like 0.03%. majority people hospitalized, let alone die, generally unhealthy already obesity/diabetes/etc. top like 40% cases supposedly completely asymptomatic. Plus many people mild symptoms couple days never got tested? number actual cases probably much higher (and mortality much lower). Honestly healthy young, driving work risk. telling people see families summer then, knew damn well people going gather? Plenty people shaming others outdoor BBQs, going beach, 4th July gatherings, mention attitudes towards protests, back spread far lower now. 

The time start thinking Thanksgiving back cases stable, middle rampant outbreak. problem Americans, lot Westerners, plan far ahead. say one holiday anything going much safer household mixing Christmas even New Year's. CDC wasted months advising case rampant outbreaks winter holidays, like they've wasted much time personally broke isolation period summer (yeah, yeah, I'm sorry complete isolation several months takes toll mental health) knew damn well second wave coming around October, CDC apparently didn't. Frontline healthcare workers absolutely first, early mid-December. 

- Elderly January/February. 

- ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù people general public March. 

- rest general public April. 

- Hopefully entire population June/July.

Just best guess point. China got hit first prior knowledge (no treatment, diagnosis, prevention). virus hit right winter lunar new year. 1,4 billion people. Yet virus pretty much control.

I'm talking interacted international community, rightfully success containing country. What's wrong that? Let's hope folks publish work change cancer treatment never shows up. Maybe largest one? read article?   talking Ohare? this? Ohare last weekend didn‚Äôt see single person socially distancing wearing mask least (like boarding). Well COVID-19 already spread, soooooooo ... like wave Interstellar thought mountain distance. could see someone like Blake Shelton taking part something like this, course Dolly Parton, Idk relevant country fans nowadays though. Maybe Garth Brooks would. Idk new country people, really genre I'm super familiar with. Charles Darwin. Natural Selection.

Edit: ok, maybe perfect fit. close enough. That‚Äôs magnitudes greater Asian countries. 13 thousand deaths isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfine‚Äù, definition word. Yeah makes think.

If China really want kill everyone America virus, good fuck Trump manage contract continue fight it?

What strongman, puts face fist level, gets punched, whines got punched. Thank you! keep saying people look like suggested using kittens target practice.  Boar's Head makes really good flavorful ones. local Publix sells manageable sizes. I've never looked packaging see reheat instructions, I'm sure feasible. weird title. negatives things described limited ethical questions regarding animal cruelty arbitrary sense parts animal think appetizing. negative eating bats anteater penises novel coronavirus developed humans spread across world. give fuck want eat sanitary. 

It's ignorant people's ""culture."" valid excuse something part someone's ""culture."" can't say ""it's fine dumb shit consequences"" hundreds years ago know bad. post assumes lot stance, none true. something say offend resort fallacious argument name-calling? Yeah that's whole 15 dollars local wholesale club charging members turkeys year. vote straight ticket. voted Democrat Presidency Republican couple things. trying go thought would better leader party lines. Voting conscience bad idea nowadays apparently, supposed vote party that's it. also registered independent I've taken flak well. want try judge candidates think lead better. wish people would vote independent enough votes means third party get funding next time around, actually platform instead media coverage dedicated two main parties. However understand people didnt want use vote time around independent. sides feel vitally important get guy office (or keep guy office) want waste vote. Maybe someday less contentious election cycle out. That's construct private insurance. rest world calls ""medical history"". problem *are* insulting people developmental disabilities say it. different words like racial slurs common usage retired. use slur describe someone associated slur, make less insulting people associated it. needs higher. fact treating different flu mean experts know big deal - wish everyone well. Yes! scary? really scary either. Hopefully 65 older able get soon. No, propensity coming ideas &amp; making connections. Wish way get ideas reality though. want know isn‚Äôt mandated airlines can‚Äôt fill middle seat, originally booking holiday ticket mind blown seats full. flying half capacity?! city Indiana river literally divides white black population city. enough guy perpetually one step ahead, due smarts, figure out. point, majority East thinks majority West brutal, callous, selfish, stupid. values aren‚Äôt fit 21st century. people egotistical narcissistic, unable think others. it‚Äôs flunked test civilization, protect vulnerable first.

Ok, ‚Äúthe East‚Äù going it? Gloat whiny articles like this? Fine, go ahead.

Also, East lower number deaths, still absolutely believe official COVID death count numbers compared death count numbers Western countries. Yes, trust US numbers unlike many edgy Redditors. *almost normal*

What think isn‚Äôt back normal, long get back normal well? we're xcom timeline lol can‚Äôt shut every store. everybody stockpile food, medicine, toiletries, gasoline. They're favorite charity. great mission they're on! remember though told narrative China implemented initial lockdown 60+ million people advance Chinese Nee Year order stop spread. Also, data 5 million leaving even coming from, well data 50 million Americans traveling holiday yet happen. Maybe. virus turn 1. Wasn‚Äôt consensus tho? Y‚Äôall need bum gun. never really understood whole obsession hoarding toilet paper anyway. love God something indeed glad also. I‚Äôm Aussie I‚Äôm sick people saying island. isolated required. remember sent messages everyone saying go outside cities (QLD).

And manage it? listened acted quarantined closed state boarders. STILL field hospital ready packed Brisbane haven‚Äôt local case month more. absolutely prepared every stage.

The UK much better island analogy compare us USA, didn‚Äôt even bother stopping international flights, quarantining, even considering mass testing keeping people home late.  I‚Äôve heard health care workers first line, don‚Äôt know sure. Yep. Right-of-way keep head attached body semi hits impotent think risking contaminate family deadly disease makes manly? Take viagra instead talking shit fuck sake. I‚Äôve getting groceries delivered month. Kinda concerned going outside someone porch though. Maybe leave deliveries outside 5-10 delivery person leaves. dunno. thing getting much worse it‚Äôs got panicking. someone US, I'd much rather move place like Vietnam point, whose government actually functioning capable taking care its' citizens  MASSIVE. 100% agree. would go step add we're (hopefully) learning valuable lesson social media valid replacement community, especially situation. Social pressure power here. people atomized normal life, disconnected sense community concern well others, disease (which see dangerous personal level) different?

Of course! individuals, we're constantly running risk assessments cost/benefit analyses actions take. well-being others simply factor calculations, balance risk COVID risk of, say, getting paid, easy strike. drum beat anti-quarantine crowd along - get COVID, variable, generally low, chance dying, work, _will_ starve. mad people selfish seems bizarre gussied selfishness often presented virtue, traditional sources community insulted objects scorn.

Absolutely. culture, reap sow. can't value personal freedom throw fit people want forced things. can't treat politicians liars, get angry people believe say. can't scorn churches neighborhood organizations, prizing insulation point many people never even meet neighbors, surprised sacrifice least keep neighbors safe. halloween kids comig neighbirhood ever. bet Thanksgiving travellers history. Yeah, mega fucked live? sound like insane self-loathing American can't think anything say get deleted. Even compare potential gap think would impact less dying becoming orphans. Lets solve smaller immediate problem ignoring bigger problem.

Also keep mind, everyone experiencing thing everyone given kind help next year. relatively equal footing. 

Not mention, even weren't... like there's equality education school districts normal circumstances. ‚ÄúGoing lead last christmas lot ppl‚Äù

FTFY  timeline pretty consistent gate. 50 million morons go fixing though? Voting answer current corporate government stronghold needs overthrowing. Leadership half issue. collective culture half. 

We act like citizens totally blameless, spreading disease fault unless office.

There cultures world would tolerate US leadership, never-mind vote whose behavior comparison would reduce spread casualty rates. 

US culture compared first world cultures straight bad handling things like this, regardless politicians economic system. 

These things inform influence one another. make lot assumptions spring summer likely be. whole ‚Äútwo weeks slow spread‚Äù ‚Äúok two weeks‚Äù fruitful attempt initially get things control. bring politics everything ? actual issue society blaming people blaming shitty ass government. per capita =/= per worker.

proof: place China minimum wage 1000 probably would saved lives overall. answer would tell you. cumulative effect people scared Black man president. went one extreme amplified hatred bigotry Trump came office really want waste time arguing - care much... admire impassioned response wish well.

Edit: Try better human :) Fuck isn‚Äôt. good food make delivery people bring minimum wage guess way low. Around end summer 10%+ US pegged infected. would assume we're closing 20% soon (actually probably surpassed to).

They're estimating 400k-500k actual infections per day right now. week we're ticking 1% pace, know growth exponential peak.

Still close herd immunity even exist coronaviruses infectious diseases (not without eradication effort global vaccination like saw Smallpox).   Yeah, 470k 220k more. 2k per day, 98 days March, would ~450k. basically assuming numbers stay steady go more. Seems optimistic me. ? remember allowed acknowledge spread due travel Wuhan racially insensitive Exactly. Chinese New Year helped spread across China, Thanksgiving spreading across US geographically since already everywhere; however, course connecting many people's bubbles (or non-bubbles). Quarantining contact anyone makes sense you? Remind me! 3 weeks Misery loves company. Strange   lot Americans behaving, low-key think deserve it. 

Fuck you. America greatest country history human civilization, reason American people greatest collection people world ever known, ever know.

The American people deserve best, God-given right Americans. fact temporary well fact covid hiccup due lousy leadership. Come January, lead world again. brace yourselves. could bad next weeks.

post-thanksgiving world outside houses going untenable actually *are* representative democracy. It‚Äôs long time ago, concept known redistricting (gerrymandering) conceived.

Georgia senator tests positive, senator pence yesterday Call son one time! mean, TBF, Thanksgiving always Thursday, many workplaces give everyone Friday well. often guaranteed four consecutive days many workers. That's people schedule stuff around Thanksgiving. would great essay Maybe I‚Äôm selfish, quarantine 8 months, barely ever seeing family, I‚Äôm gonna pass one chance finally see them.

 Mmm yes, grandfather Nurgle pleased. 98 percent currently contagious, many recovered. 3% US population tested positive experts estimated 5-10 times number infected, 15-30% likely infected.

Hell yeah, incredible democracy! ü§£ ... Also, yes election decided people decided election officials think know better American people. Amazing. MAFA? Coming Asian country living US years, noticed Asian folks deference authority. government scientists say serious, people agree follow orders. much US.

AFAIK majority hospitals overrun covid patients. Mainly hospitals densely populated metropolitan areas experiencing problem. may totally wrong idk. Flattening curve order prevent hospitals overwhelmed solid argument limited shutdowns.
I think question framed lives lost vs. livelihoods lost. choosing overarching lockdowns (all ages, health levels) saving lives sacrificing many livelihoods. survivability greater 99%. fact it‚Äôs 99.997% 0-19 years, 99.98% 20-49 years, 99.5% 50-69 years, 94.6% people 70+. numbers directly CDC. 
I willing take chances exchange livelihood. Also quick side note, majority immunocompromised people (high blood pressure, diabetes, obese) like bad decisions they‚Äôve made life. fault unhealthy. don‚Äôt care health, I? people need sacrifice ONE Thanksgiving. can't it. Americans selfish, arrogant ignorant. never chance beating thing. Welcome. ;) husband plans go San Antonio visit family friends seen year. Bought August cancelled month ago.

Hmmm short time stupid. like couldn‚Äôt pre order one you‚Äôre new excuse

We're talking medical workers here. uses analogy, people already 'PS5' bought paid waiting pick up... want one. They'd like wait next generation, games released.

What strange analogy. üòÇ upvoted Well it'd like City New York tried covering pandemic feds found out? exactly think virus spreads? It‚Äôs respiratory droplets. Coming mouth. mask pulled chin. every event I‚Äôve seen that‚Äôs percentage people wear masks. doesn‚Äôt take 10 50 people wearing masks spread virus ton people. know virus transmission works all? lot families going really, really sad Christmas. Dr. Michael Osterholm said podcast feels like he‚Äôs standing open field watching tornado get closer closer since summer. Right he‚Äôs feeling wind. can‚Äôt get imagery head. calling Americans bullshit still get downvoted hell.

Fucking disgusting hipocrisy. right. 

But point still stands. China exception here. Deathe growing fast hospitalizations higher April (and growing fast) Stability doesent equal freedom. measures many eastern countries used curb virus counterproductive freedom western countries crave. 

All dont support lockdowns, problem one education. People smart enough make decisions risk lives others, problem not. Yeah. don‚Äôt know thinking. get wants see family, Florida 80+ year olds doesn‚Äôt sound safe right now. first wave testing arm, tens thousands people vaccinated months. Stop buying antivax propaganda. guess don‚Äôt believe high blood pressure, won‚Äôt it? Cool. ? I'm flying US UK Christmas. complete 2 week quarantine arriving (which fine, visa 3 years).

_You died dysentery_ applies everyone meeting anybody, yet even low chances, many people died even got sick. Albertsons/Tom Thumb/affiliates gives 10% groceries coupon, $20 off, free insurances. pandemic tend buy bulk, 1 month supplies time always hit threshold. get one coupon per family member get shot!

It makes sense even outside pandemic - food stores don‚Äôt want gross sick people wandering coughing stuff. could even advance. could announce today national lockdown December 1-22 everyone would get shopping done right away, next week, stay home three weeks. Grocery stores close time. thing needs distributed food needy couldn‚Äôt afford three week supply.

There's gap people say do... 45% people take flu shot. would interesting see civil unrest handled expresses various countries. Perhaps main course action public gathering protest, generally hostile attitude towards government would also see spikes cases. Especially UK, US France might seem troubled this.

Plus would also suspect pure physical mobility people west far greater east. would think scare highly contagious virus imminent several eastern country. Like outbreak SARS must prepared eastern countries differently, western countries largely unaffected, little prepare similar outbreak occur. would also interesting see protections put place Ebola outbreak, later scaled down.

One could perhaps legitimately criticize western governments, certainly global community certainly failed many respects. seems like diplomatic situations exist similarly early 19th century. every country itself, seems lack collective effort. scientific community sort able perform miracles spite governmental support lack thereof.

My advice get 4 year degree local state university (or one another state prefer establish residency applying). give discounts tuition in-state students, even without those, get comparable education fraction cost private school.

Just remember want enter decent medical school need take certain courses like bio, anatomy physiology, organic chem, etc (and need good grades).

I‚Äôm basing reply Dr Anthony Fauci said. said vaccine may stop person person transfer. even immune system able neutralize 99% virus recover, get sick again, 1% still opens possibility shedding virus infecting people. it‚Äôs less safety helping stop spread.

I follow rules 100% want go eat.... get point though science saying I‚Äôm safe this. I'm dying go traveling vacation like used to. I'm not, know, literally going die go traveling vacation.

(Though wave, little warmer, might go hotel airbnb someplace walk around outside see stuff, maybe Savannah. maybe beach airbnb nice view water.) History lump together whole time period, school reopening, halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New years, look back ask could stupid. tired Covid-19 doesn‚Äôt get tired.

He's elf, even species. help us much. Dudes immortal something. Perhaps I‚Äôm misunderstanding comment, seems like nothing (staying home) actually better? Long-Term effects beyond 8 weeks demonstrated prevalent 2-2.2% symptomatic cases. number heavily leaning towards older age brackets, long-term effects result overpowered cytokine response damage bodies.

The long term effects nowhere near prevalent younger people warrant concern. say 21 year old, I‚Äôd comfortable catching COVID. think bigger group watch long term effects would 50-65. good chance surviving, still lots life years left, decent risk deregulated immune response. Rebellion.

You got problem answer? Yep. posted another comment state requires bilingual least associate's public health. BA psychology meet criteria yet state says understaffed. Last winter coworker threatening quit withdraw society US reached 100k.

the hippocratic oath exists. folks think way cruel inhuman. !remindme December 4 Let's see get comment through

This makes Blu look worse. Way positive cases red, also tests. Blu way deaths. need idiotic theory Chinese superior way living sub drools disprove China's horrific human rights track record.

I would argue allowing hundreds thousands people get infected millions get possible long-term tissue damage viral infection bigger human rights abuse whatever think perfidious Chinese ever done people. 

But it‚Äôs pretty clear boner western capitalism I‚Äôm sure focus hypocritical gaze shitty things evil Asians do. 

Life cheap West, know? good news... hopefully choose stay home circumcise still US, Hippocratic Oath doesnt mean shit.

Mink infected coronavirus found farm Eure-et-Loire region western France, 1,000 mink farm culled, French agriculture ministry said Sunday.

Cases mink also reported elsewhere Europe, notably Sweden, Greece Netherlands.

In Denmark, virus found mutated different strain, experts feared could render vaccine less effective transmitted back humans. Around 17 million mink due culled there.

France started testing four mink farms mid-November.

""At stage, tests shown virus circulating Eure-et-Loire farm,"" ministry said. ""A second farm unscathed. Tests still way last two farms, results expected week."" problem is,that regardless, become conspiracy theory.  People twisted evil world take scenario.  intended all.  conversation anyways.  There's plan.  world government's can't work together is, barely know they're pandemic. problem west

So yeah east west thing lol. PM I‚Äôll purchase one way flight :)  parents live general area good isolating. brother coming home uni one day Thanksgiving. parents demanding come I'm scared. viral load stores safe, low chance going store. Especially people wearing masks. People need get death rate. hospitalization rate matters. hospitalization rate high hospitals cope. Full hospitals mean lot death covid lot things.

 Talk history repeating itself, SMH. national outlook ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt it‚Äôs responsibility take care you‚Äù. point give let ""pandemic over"" folks crash burn. allocate hospital/medical resources patients first anything left covid patients get care.

I know cruel angry brother caught covid wearing masks unless forced to, social distance insisted living usual life ""its worse flu"" tends drive thoughts place go.

Thats tried preface saying. realized landlord way sounded seemed like landlord maybe/possibly something wrong there.

The way sounded paid month, still got kicked thought possible lease expired. I've seen people think (that landlord kick mid month/etc). Fucking christ, charge it, get government contract give free, fucking fuckbags! goddamned nation health crisis fucking grease smears! Sweden‚Äôs covid policy suicidal reckless, better mask mandating nations previously locked down?
And Sweden compared it‚Äôs neighbors? think controlled Trump...? CDC controlled Trump either, part executive branch.  Florida Georgia Line probably would. kinda surprised get lot people telling masks work stuff ig comments, shut real quick every time. area, NE Ohio, takes 4 days even get test + results take 2-5 days.

If people making decisions get sick cares? possible infect staying home. necessary everyone go outside people going get sick matter what. 

Either stay inside month one goes outside shit fuck everything else useless. Including bleeding heart bullshit. Nurses make lot. probably best job outside tech money. Especially get competitive nursing jobs. Well, that's actually true. google ventilation airplanes good air within plane changed 12 times per hour. Dead people don‚Äôt drive cars???

2018 Accidents (unintentional injuries): 167,127 deaths

The problem true statement. hospitals going ration care choose lives dies.

No one everything right, wore masks, stayed home essentials left die idiot called hoax spread others gets treatment instead. 

When comes rationing care, picking lives dies, innocent bystanders deserve priority. Screw China, US Stupidity! Come CO...vid! 1 week exponential growth holds trust Vietnam‚Äôs data.

Evil point view, ignorant would fit them, yes? Sooner better. site disturbing That‚Äôs different thing claiming healthcare system collapse. contingency plans disaster protocols haven‚Äôt even thought initiating yet.

The actual purpose lockdowns utilize properly completely lost Americans. National lockdowns, like ones lot people sub seem want, generally stopgap outbreaks designed eliminate COVID. people start mentioning NZ Melbourne, NZ island locked massive outbreaks also kept borders closed. Melbourne, locked severely almost 4 months, businesses citizens receiving financial compensation. Meanwhile, America can't even get stimulus passed get measly $300. Lockdowns work vacuum like Americans think do. could use martial law country get things back control big chuck redditors introverted shut ins. perfect them: stay inside avoid people hero! ben honest told truth plus history saying things make administration appear prejudiced. WILLFULLY IGNORANT!!!!! pandemic shown two types people:

Those think everything fine virus big deal

Those think humanity going end this

People addicted fake reality. Reddit likes fear mongering side. Probably not. probably heard reporters saying study time indicated lasts least months didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúat least‚Äù means. lot happening earlier year.

We don‚Äôt know sure long immunity last, course, Covid hasn‚Äôt us long enough test that. there‚Äôs enough experience similar viruses interactions immune systems start making educated projections based things like antibody titers T/B cell behavior, researchers doing. Yeah, sounds right. it‚Äôs ‚ÄúMe, me, ME! money, appearance.‚Äù That‚Äôs think about. link research instead shit tier propaganda? point I'm illegally cross Canadian border. know air still spreads, even outdoors, right? mitigates risk, absolutely catch covid breathing air someone waking feet away.

The virus doesn‚Äôt sit think ‚Äúoh, guess he‚Äôs outside, totally can‚Äôt infect him!‚Äù virus doesn‚Äôt give fuck whether you‚Äôre inside outside. Order tea towels. wash them. Conserve paper towels gross stuff. Nobody gives shit, shut fuck Completely agree. 

I isolated 9 months, leaving house every couple weeks. flight Wednesday. tested negative covid quarantined since moment took test. another test scheduled day return quarantine get test results. wearing N95 mask face shield plane. Thanksgiving dinner 4 people. 

But apparently I'm spawn satan something. think point. Everyone take good look.

April 8, 2020, mr supposedly closed border still allowed US citizens return wuhan &amp; everyone come parts China partial effort. already started coming east coast USA Europe proven tracking mutations.

addtionally tens thousands americans still allowed travel afflicted area followed got home, advised quarantine even freaking tempature taken HA Good Mr Gates...I I'll tell why:

this fastest drug ***ever*** pushed creation, human testing approval market, people worried that...bad shit happens things get rushed, something serious needs LOT testing ever approved use literally 100's millions people, perhaps billions...I, one, touching vaccines see others reacted good length time...I trust something created rushed matter couple months, medicinea/vaccine/etc generally take years trials approved public use

&amp;#x200B;

but sure, go ahead trust vaccine blindly Mr Gates, good luck you

&amp;#x200B;

jumps ahead time 6 months: R.I.P bill gates, remembered lol Pretty sure virus originated spread communist country 40% Americans plan traditional Thanksgiving. hard understand big family gatherings plus travel. really living two different Americas. evil, ask ICU nurse  Lol. Sadly crowd, yes. You‚Äôre great!!!! True. Wishing harm good, causing harm another thing, kinda following covid rules. Thank you, appreciate frequent posts situation there.

And agree theory Sweden's divergence neighbors contributed higher death rates next door unfortunately. remember stories summer Local pressure Sweden excluded Nordic travel bubbles reason eventually Sweden left specifically due death infection rates.

And yes, shocking sad. I've spent years referencing Sweden's leadership traffic safety car seat safety particular, watching government follow anti science policies just...strange. protests/riots/mass celebrations going completely socially distant, increasing covid risk going them. cure. Thanksgiving thing gonna infect lot people first even vaccine gets deployed guys still need go hospital. Thanks, parents live village rural UK. They've careful, isolating since February living China warned UK gonna bad Italy. told back assume people come contact asymptomatic presymptomatic. like $352 without insurance guy's point valid makes dumb statements. claims modern world seen catastrophe like this, atomic bombs Japan. Rwanda? Even Asian Flu 1968-69 death toll relatively comparable seeing (to fair, I'm speaking per capita basis, 2-4X longer timeline, nine months).


My view biggest way get virus levels low never let get high first place, mentions. West learn hard way first time. 


Once levels started get high, even now, believe best strategy massive age based awareness program. found way isolate/quarantine people 50 years old, either education incentives, toll would also close 85-95% less. That's something tried, maybe age discrimination kind Western principles. 

So that's recommendation next pandemic early lockdowns possible palatable - massive age based incentives/opportunites stay home shelter place - ""If hill, we'll pick bill"". sure. Cold = control spread. front page news, yeah get word Holmes ! ;) No.... they‚Äôre IGNORANT That‚Äôs likely government pay, obviously depending whether government pay. difference likely due size order placed government, I‚Äôm mistaken. U.S unemployed longer max allowed (this depends state live in, around 26 weeks) stop eligible money. 

It's bit mind blowing describe, someone could recieve money years without working disabled. Bold assume they're 70 state, free drive-in testing clinics. Also, people money always find way get tested. get concierge medicine physician area come give rapid covid test *at house* tomorrow pay $400. Can't wait see gavin newsomes Thanksgiving party like never bail private industry. Ever 
 
Other counties well either. countries entered active recessions. 


We cut military budget. cut lot stuff. Like lot. lot lot People keep streaming restaurant husband works. restaurant contact register adheres current COVID-19 regulations.

Of course means come restaurant husband works, there‚Äôs telling bring them, then, restaurant, order stay open, insist on

They‚Äôll shouting clouds though. have. Australia New Zealand two obvious examples. also essentially zero Covid too. coincidence.

(Note borders shut citizens - can‚Äôt legally refuse citizen entry country international law) identify know, want go back summer 300 cases per day :( large cross-section stabley-employed, ""it happen me"" labor market lost jobs blink eye. That's healthy dose perspective suggests everyone appears increased recognition situational causes poverty amidst pandemic, actually recognized negative impact COVID-19 poor change attributions poverty actually translate decreased support inequality increased support government intervention help poor.‚Äù

So people understand fault still think get help. /facepalm small population study little evidence anything presented! bad. Toilet paper lines... 2020, peoples' priorities now. Pretending Ignorance Ignorance? sure weird way spell ""idiots."" Thank you. Drug prices usually high R&amp;D costs huge demand low, cost per dose needs high enough pay back investors make kind profit (or least break even).

If drug going used way often, cost could negotiated down. Stop critical thinking! probably lot less miles driven. People meeting fewer people less travelling even travelling. populated counties east state. non mask counties west lightly populated. end study, 20 counties non mask area less 10 total cases each. Three counties one case each. Two got one case week ending study, one one case July 1 didn‚Äôt get another one whole time. 

Also, Wichita Sedgwick county. Wichita largest city state mask mandate Sedgwick county didn‚Äôt. counted towards non mask county increase, accounted 44% increase counties. Similarly, Hays, Salina, Manhattan, Emporia cities mandates counties not, major hubs commerce areas. 

Also, week study ends, 7 8 colleges started tested every person arriving campus. accounted large amount non mask spike well. 

This straightforward ‚Äúmask counties good, non mask counties stupid‚Äù everyone making be. Yeah, facility reason took lean mean never order anything item fully runs out, buy product contracted supplier, also sister location overnight us week's worth item, would also pay for. select regions near ICU capacity. vast majority country not. I‚Äôm pretty sure person earth ever thought ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like EMT cushy schedule.‚Äô saving gas money picking groceries? still drive grocery store. think even reading posts. bother.

See side. Private business, I‚Äôm CEO Founder. Let‚Äôs say US actually 30,000,000 real cases date. (just sake argument, could way could less)

If 500,000 people infected day, need 70% population infected, would mean would another 210,000,000 infected people. 

To reach number 500,000 cases per day, would take 420 days reach heard immunity. 

Now course certain areas reach 70% level whole lot faster country whole. would still far away heard immunity. mean virus. still it. Negative tests mean anything all. Besides virus time tested. get soon touch door handle way out. practicing lot restraint, prob start journal...so much anger reading this.

People spend two hours preparing easy mac 12:00 M-F clue. read ordered nine doses per person, that's lot! virus. I‚Äôm threat one. Congrats! hope happy life together. born part ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù *you* work hard enough achieve dreams? stay home 3 weeks, go that. can't believe people selfish enough stay home 3 weeks.

It's week 35 3 weeks. I‚Äôve similar thoughts them. costs won‚Äôt admit wrong. that, ultimately lead undoing continue. Tests mean anything. get virus soon walking door right getting test done. Antibodies may decline that‚Äôs ok because...the body still remembers. 

Not virus studies show immunity likely lasts years.

Provide link reputable plague. deadly comparison. 

The black plague Europe still around today people still get sick it. difference medical science LARP something. Obviously do

When die, see white, met judgement. universe beyond comprehension. believe god, believe energy converted, synaptic energy converts goes somewhere die. It'll free India bottom list what. treatment. grand majority people ""survive"" hospital would've survived anyway, ones really sick might last weeks longer hospital intubated, succumb anyway  - needs analysis sort things (too much speculation). Bottom line, go gatherings. Yes. baseline stupidity bit higher. Lmao little silly downvote this. Chris christie ben carson Also ballpark vaccine results. What's known whether level immune response affects it, whether certain people unluckily fail make right immune response ""first time"", whether higher viral dose responsible could happen anyone less often, combination true. like part talk much cost company manufacture distribute. Pharmaceutical companies charity business, going operate loss sake public relations. Worse good portion money paid government contracts go war chests future lobbying efforts.

Also inevitably complications widespread distribution new vaccines. freak deaths. imagine government contracts protect companies possible liabilities. Exactly, pretend won‚Äôt. know better deep down, play along narrative keep appearances people. may even convince repeating often enough. honest moment, know. don‚Äôt care. masks, helpful, 100 percent effective. think r/sciende supports view - weeks ago study found people rough/unsafe home conditions become conservative less open new ideas. People need safe good material conditions open progress. Yes... well... that's accurate. that's data reported.

I checked data hand Puerto Rico really bad reporting data. last weeks, they've reported equal number tests positive results. almost dropped Puerto Rico data set, but... need love. always get forgotten (That said, drop smaller US territories). watch. magically disappear. Hahahahahahaha

You simple stupid. 

1. Antibodies may decline that‚Äôs ok because...the body still remembers. 

2. Recent studies show immunity likely lasts years.

3. plague. deadly comparison. 

4. Go LARP something. Obviously India law either. 50 million Americans don‚Äôt give fuck we‚Äôre middle pandemic. Hopefully doesnt come super great part explosive exponential growth. Consider adding Trump maskless rallies battleground states, Sturgis motorcycle rally. Maybe feel lot better family. got covid week half ago flying. matter wear masks half people take drink eat airport full idiots noses people deem cell phone call worthy taking mask roaming airport. Dude live life. Yep, have, know anything stats, change rate demographic. aunt stored meantime? I'd rather cremated buried instead stored cold place somewhere. STFU, it‚Äôs bad. Washing hands interacting mask. Especially taking inevitable rub droplets outside mask got hands eyes nose. manage cemetery crematorium, already is. think everyone like them. think poor family 5 people one bedroom apartment, goodluck exercising ""training mind"" scenarios.  home tests 80%+ accuracy. work really well, negatives viral loads load really contagious. 

I could test 3 times week $1/test government would get way. 

It's perfect testing much effective widespread. know world begins ends borders US wish luck hope kill anyone care know deny could done anything extra saved american values. Yep Christmas push numbers even higher Autoimmune first go back /r/conservative? would measles mumps mumps measles? think fine. case risk low. think important slow spread, can't ignore fact people need spend time others, general well also physical health. good quarantining getting tested before. Almost like want happen... strange, don‚Äôt think? Yep perfect time go vacation üôÑ Intentional would Bill Gates bluescreens Coronavirus Conspiracy. ah, see. decline.  Dude quite, everyone you, can't people understand that. lot people truly unaware would like truly trouble want go hassle finding would really like

I think world rethink value certain jobs pandemic... grocery stores pay enough rent mortgage maybe should. afraid paying teenagers students ""living wage"" make student wage. Regulate business certain size minimum number full time employees full benefits making living wage (and punish companies bare minimum violate spirit laws). ban hiring cheap school hours.

A lot people idea anyone certain jobs especially low paid jobs. No, anyone certain jobs. Many people would horribly get fired right away including finger waggers. easy looks. noticed that, filtered ‚Äú% Positive‚Äù last 14 days, Puerto Rico 100%. accurate?? problem scale individual people try justify small journey. travelling dad need get fuel snacks? Physical interactions people virus spread. keep touch online? science points antibodies decaying within couple months, violent mutating virus achieve makes antibodies moot regardless.

You continuing proliferation makes chances mutations higher, well sickness spread.

Again, eat shit, die, plague-bearer. still monarchy around would drawn quartered now. Pfizer said they'll dispatch within 4 hours, however it'll workers, public roll could take upto feb numbers go higher expected thought bad couple months ago. That‚Äôs 50M entitled morons country. 

I‚Äôll home figuring grill Turkey wrapped bacon &amp; drinking hard seltzer‚Äôs Looks like third wave going one history books. look back fondly 200k day reminisce much better things back then. Tell people can't leave houses Australia. idiots say anything ppl partying pedophile chief got elected?  
Or ppl next day thanskgiving? black friday. 


If tongue quite issue, lashes familys...That's little hypocritical. mid late Jan, would hard find state thing. shit show top bottom. letting country burn. care them, care you. Quid pro quo. Probably is. despise them. thing is, don‚Äôt think kill people. least pretend won‚Äôt. posted link ""support"" claim immunity lasting months. link posted showed opposite claim. calmly explained got butthurt. [US military ready deliver 40 million doses Americans FDA Yep name shame PCR test waste time. ""rapid"" tests wrong 45% time. May well flip coin. don‚Äôt know personally, went effect today I‚Äôve seen posts already shared Facebook, wearing mask walking cars parking lot Walmart, one smoking outside different grocery store. Plus one cleaner mall work in. seems they‚Äôre enforcing quite strictly

Edit: I‚Äôm Atlantic Canada we‚Äôve cases compared nurses doctors countries get paid even less all/delayed (the case Philippines) quick shot took yes, way many people terminal. masked experience. Unfortunately population 150M US. see levels loss general population take 1M covid deaths.

Unfortunately, think start really paying attention problem gets point. big problem gets point anything anymore. mean, trust fact people overcrowding hospitals like are? ahhh okay wondering 20 seems cap would expect.  Le epic r/whoosh friend XD Wtf title? Hundreds millions traveling Chinese New Year. He‚Äôs asshole; emailed yesterday. couldn‚Äôt GAF us princess palace governors mansion SHUT DOWN! literally takes payments personal injury yet won‚Äôt mandate masks H‚ÄëE‚ÄëB frac Greg... crazy pandemic exactly 100 years ago everyone photos dont exist world anymore future people looking back time like future generation look back 2020 corona virus year us exist anymore world. Jesus, haughty dipshit. mean, you‚Äôre right attitude doesn‚Äôt help anyone. shit psychotic Yep figured out. Thanks agreeing bud high school ""friends"" (i.e. facebook friends never talk really like them) posting pictures weddings, corn mazes, pumpkin patches, brunch. Fuck them. I'm tempted start commenting posts. people US type people 1v1 Magnus Carlson, take pawn, say, 

""HA TOOK PAWN, HEY GUYS TOOK PAWN"" 

""but took queen""

""I TOOK PAWN HA"" Singapore top 20 countries lowest death per capita, similar NZ, 0 countries europe make list...So think well enough Perhaps never late start wearing masks stop spread. 

But late prevent anti-mask backlash encouraged Trump Republicans. Even enact mandate, useless people actively fight Sherifs cops refuse enforce them

That genie bottle going back (without severe military enforcement) mean think western countries well, it‚Äôs China India hiding fact terrible? TOILET PAPER!!!! Rich people bad. cannot believe fucking stupidly Americans behaving right now. Stay fuck home. That's kind thought... like, based many people republican ride-or-die like, damn... Biden would lost landslide, *so* depressing. think I'll go goth end year. India part East Asia. Keep killing grandmas? hell talking about? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 204,179 new cases two days ago. dumb half America Agolf Twitler? millions people ill virus told big deal. I've lost ill many friends family friends last two weeks can't even keep track more. Via facebook social media aware well 50 people. People KS hometown claiming Ft. Riley spraying rural towns chemtrails infect effort scare ""real patriots"" wearing masks. I'm still unclear months Liberals get making rednecks wear piece cloth nose &amp; mouth, apparently something quite insidious diabolical. Pretty sure it‚Äôs going take mandatory vaccination stomp thing out. many people know got ticket? city/state? Serious hopefully offensive question y‚Äôall get pregnant ? 1) children go school receive education
2) parents PAY childcare school
3) schools exist allow parents work. cannot believe seriously think that. 
4) even schools house community functions - primary purpose. example, church rents school Sundays mean school‚Äôs purpose church. absurd argument. regardless, month month rules pretty standard across states lol Illinois one friendlier ones surprisingly lol portraying target demographic- people like need read article most! ? hope quarantine 14 days prior Xmas. hope see parents confident spread them. following quarantine 14 days get back. going long 29 days feel worth wait, peace mind spread elderly parents. however curious, think plan? convinced bad idea. I'll risking getting I'm healthy young person. I'm one really taking risk scenario parents work non remote jobs. point opt out. Also point nationwide. Wtf happened. Y‚Äôall great beginning east ""figure out"" anything. Asia comprised large collectivist cultures thousands years old. They've well-positioned manage situation like one generations. 

The west entirely opposite, especially US individualism part every aspect culture. yes, hemisphere, much ""the dream"", continue many years come. I‚Äôve really fortunate keep able work remotely pandemic, natural homebody really hasn‚Äôt affected much. say nice able return going store movies without paranoia worry. trust photos videos China's people gathering living life normal.  Well do, US propaganda. definitely possible, percentage positive results way higher. fair millennials went 2008 crash probably comparatively frugal. üôÑ 

K. correct decision, impossible overstate much better even (still republican) state like Utah compared MS. told wife earlier felt like moved america third world country.  really don‚Äôt give shit protecting others anymore, I‚Äôm gonna protect shit, don‚Äôt expect locums prn staff come rushing Yes, absolutely real. cannot come without going quarantine two negative tests. Let put way: COVID WI already killed 50 people per 100,000 (that's typical reporting unit). typical year something like 730 total (per 100k): 160 heart disease, 150 cancer, 45 ""accidents"" 3rd place. So, 3/4 year COVID already third leading cause death Wisconsin 2020. Experts strongly expect COVID-19''s death rate WI surpass 5,000 New Year... would 10% **all** deaths year there. That's mask mandate, shutdowns, really get cooking state summer.

COVID-19 bad. People take whole week thanksgiving get 9 days price 3 vacation days. makes sense Friday heavy travel day. Modena, Pfizer, companies literally save world vaccines, exaggeration. need make little profit make worthwhile them, that's fine me, especially considering really expensive flu shot. Running large pharma company takes quite bit money, next disease rolls around, I'd rather financial position address one well.

Yeah, freak side effects sometimes, really saying companies liable something like that. vaccines treated according standards set world governments, we're kinda crisis mode right now. Obviously can't really know long-term effects are, pretty certain less people die freak deaths suggest, people would die waiting imaginary perfect 100% effective vaccine.

I'll first one call big pharma wrongdoing, it. literally complaining Trump voters going thanksgiving. family Trump voters not, opinion valid. \#alliwantforchristmas Agree would total loss. average middle class voter happy life doesn‚Äôt want massive change potentially wreck plans wouldn‚Äôt stoked massive changes could cause social upheavals. Bernie wanted raise wealth tax anyone 32 million (or number) net worth. Sure paper that‚Äôs great equality what‚Äôs stopping multimillionaires simply taking fortunes moving countries happy investments businesses? think Bernie sanders policies would caused brain drain country would terrible effects innovation employment. USA competitive encourage innovation many smart people around world come education stay here.

I can‚Äôt speak millions voters think plenty people like would realized much radical change quick bad thing. shut small mom pops? screw them? 70 million people stupid fuck. Pepperidge Farm remembers favourite ones spend $150 lottery tickets coz think change significantally improved.  know, long grandparents already dead anyways. Shows fucked social media FOX News really are. Healthcare worker here. Maybe time I'll die get relief. Sadly it‚Äôs freezer trucks - imagine they‚Äôre deployed deal bodies hospital staff overwhelmed right, wrong. Also assumed living. O'hare layover Last time flew guy next sipped drink 90% flight. think even swallowing, putting lips. think they've found loophole wear mask. Where‚Äôs source claim? Yes, nationwide news every time case. know they're from, got etc. cases border arrivals quarantine anyway - couple community cases week ago, (as someone general public unconnected border) major news, closed CBD largest city, contact tracing locations people visited. genomic testing find likely source outbreak - yes basically strain. huge deal here. mandatory masks flights public transport also. 

We've living ""normal"" life year nobody wants fuck up. don‚Äôt read propaganda  really nailed entire situation comment, agree 100% everything said. complete catastrophe getting insane every day. frustrated deniers! CNN that. help current situation. Instead, CNN news organizations campaign Twitter, Facebook reform Fox News OANN lose broadcast permits. Fox news terrorist organization, fear mongering one hurt society. 


Healing begins end Fox news, help people dissect feelings. need stop hating country men. However, think Biden kill Fox, we'll situation Trump nothing criticize Biden 4 years, people really buy it. hope Trump banned social media. mediocre steak keep mind footnote data. I've checked state archives. North Dakota, instance, correct 15%. Wyoming, however, reporting 6.8% website. insanely inflated 57% due data inconsistencies hard track down. even read article? think solution counties follow mandate ban non-residents entering county. Obvious exceptions supply trucks like. think probably refrigeration trucks ready start shipping hospitals pharmacies around country. doubt we‚Äôll see HUMVEEs MRAPs streets deliveries. free free go target stores. even give 5 dollar gift card incentive lol. Herd immunity requires whole lot people infected becomes effective. I'm liberal-leaning, I've working home 12hrs day weeks boyfriend, rare occasion leave house pick food something wear mask sanitize like crazy. I'm in-person Thanksgiving parents (who live pretty locally), patio heaters 10ft apart. touch go inside, food prepared individually ahead time.

Are entitled, stupid, reckless? (I know say that, I'm responding overall judgment towards people taking every precaution see family first time nearly year.) beginning this, critical anyone leaving home non-essential reasons whatsoever. work together flatten curve. there's coordinated plan. People taking precautions trying keep businesses afloat completely destroy mental health. could continue another year, idea. I'm longer judgmental resentful towards people feel like return lives somewhat long they're taking guidelines seriously. I'm going restrict going outside seeing loved ones responsibly either. hate Trump words accurately explain broken clock right twice day. also fan TikTok like download TikTok Trump also like TikTok. Thank you. really appreciate quick response information. quite impressive work! Thank sharing. America Targets Yep sympathy anyone votes self interest. close natural selection modern world deeply ingrained anti socialism goes here

Hatred towards poor obsession/worship wealthy deeply ingrained American culture. Wait, thought supposed disappear election? Guess fucking listened infectious disease experts spent careers understanding viruses instead fucktards posting Twitter. 

I graduated nursing school May started ER nurse July. much experience, already tired. I'm tired ""Hero"" talk meant placate people working frontlines. I'm tired people telling us ""bullshit"" can't let stay loved ones hospital, I'm tired people minimizing risks virus. everyone took seriously terribly frustrating, no, make selfish ideas personal freedom. Fuck core spread information downplaying threat virus, fuck lack common decency wear fucking mask order protect family, friends, community.

 pathetic difficult become people something simple could significant impact course pandemic. looking (and blaming) wrong animals people.

The ""blaming"" part worries most. know bats, camels, civets carry transmit coronaviruses Also dogs, cats, mink, known contract Covid. think study animals host pass viruses important preventing future outbreaks new strains and/or respiratory diseases. 

Maybe cause live states seen harm people blaming countries done science. 

Best wishes stay safe. 

p.s. thanks civil response. often get accused halfwit stating contrarian view. Gday mate. 15 days think NSW. literally doctor traveling Hope best, prep worst You‚Äôre right, guy said ‚ÄúAmerica deserves COVID‚Äù he‚Äôll get upvotes, maybe don‚Äôt understand much Reddit hates US. Target paid $5. Republicans. That‚Äôs true still criticize China withholding information beginning hold leaders accountable. reason us both! issue political. point mitigate spread coronavirus. mask helps that. Use polearm claim self-defense. Fucking thank you. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait months‚Äù mindset blows mind much Asian countries well prepared thanks experience SARS-1. knew right away do. mean, plastic bags super hard open (especially store also gives disposable gloves)... that‚Äôs excuse. rub fingers something moist, there‚Äôs tons grocery store Dont forget need two shots. Bingo. analysis here, opinion. shave before. Calm down, please seek mental health services Damn You‚Äôre cool dude thanks much delusional. Publix America. Yup. there‚Äôs one thing living different countries taught me, it‚Äôs humans dumb everywhere, get news coverage US. 100 years we‚Äôve advanced point exact thing - wear masks. would funny wasn‚Äôt sad. A/s/l? totally serious. Stop acting like older person reddit.

And don‚Äôt think fundamentalism hasn‚Äôt grown past 20 years actually might dementia Would trust anything confederate supporters say US? recall reading last winter/spring people likely end hospitalized &amp; ICA China one other.

this many countries encouraging people get flu vaccine prevent double infections worse outcomes *slinging clam chowder old ladies*

I idea uncomfortable statement... Deep South also delivered Georgia highest poverty rates well high concentrations minorities. Don‚Äôt hate Deep South entirely government ridiculous, hate lack federal assistance get negative feedback loops. It‚Äôs really classist throw whole Deep South, lot people here. Something like 40% AL usually goes blue locale based problem, versus planet wide medical issues much population? Specifically poorer people unbelievably good proud Australian Medicare... fucking national treasure right there, that's Star Trek economy right there. Transitioning efficient distribution surplus actually next major challenge, fighting lame border battle in. mean, 1918 still full crowds attending sporting events. aware. pay hella lot taxes Canada get ""free"" flu shot Wow nearly year since corona stuck head out. time last year. Fuck staying home Honestly, know one could say. Everyone know could find way work every day. M-F time school session standard work hours. Schools session weekends. know this?

Yes, people find someone day watch kids, every weekday year? Nope. People lives responsibilities cannot drop everything watch someone else‚Äôs kids year. yes. 
according sub, family skype Thanksgiving dinner separate bunkers, worse Hitler.  think there's growing number people doubting honesty 95%. They're anti vax alarmists. skeptical kind envisioned military's role cause anyone call FEDEX say need package delivered thank you. Changing topic eh cuz losing argument? Good idea! wouldn‚Äôt able come back. Cut loses try again! Obviously didnt poll Congress...... We'd need research know sure, strains like danish mink strains harder selective pressure without much effect immunity, probably unlikely would make much difference vaccine effectiveness. Definitely keep eye animal reservoirs long term. Lol give heart disease others breathing them? you‚Äôre going troll account you‚Äôre supposed clever. Maybe evil punchable looking faces. Tragicomedically ironically, many public/visible faces Christianity society.

Largely we've transformed Christianity message ""make world better place uplift one another create Kingdom God Earth"" ""save yourself"".  Can‚Äôt colleges form bubble similar nba did?, bring students campus 2 weeks early, test, quarantine everyone 14 days, that, test students regularly, nobody goes campus whole semester  That's fair request. I'm anti vax rushing take vaccine.

It's normal cautious new vaccine don‚Äôt disagree. America west messed up. it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt excuse withholding info start Hospital work said priority be:

1) staff long term care/nursing homes, since patients much higher fatality rate otherwise isolated
2) hospital staff (not mandatory point think end being)
3) vulnerable person (so elderly, secondary conditions)
4) general public think that's lot folks tend forget. experience, I've seen people take virus seriously way August/September, eventually stop. Many people start seeing covid thing that's mentioned news. know anybody who's gotten it, taken hospital, easy forget about. I'm saying good thing, human nature adapt live things to. response people ""if Trump says vaccine good mean shit whether take it"". Trump telling people take vaccine much persuade left take it, said Vaccine recommended approved FDA, WHO, CDC, Fauci pushed politicians like Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Bernie Sanders etc. people left much reason reject it.  We'd need another year even approach levels, would saturate capacity care sick well then.

Plenty people still get sick months months yet, could easily hit another doubling case rate (and would break backs many hospitals) winter over. silver lining Thanksgiving may bad enough keep people thing month later, ""Christmas important"". Even worse lungs. Don‚Äôt ask. appears people learned nothing China cancelling Chinese New Year Agreed Took bit longer decipher would like admit add point, example Labour UK, Corbyn lost historic number seats basically handed whole country Johnson conservative Tories least 5 years. lots factors play, yes, reality is, Sanders like progressive leader ostensibly liberal country (but still close analog American body politic) got absolutely hammered general election. capitalism problem. cultural government response issue

Wait find that‚Äôs thing US 1/4 million dead 1/2 million dead. Keep coping. Numbers insane weeks. states pointless curfew switch lockdown again. get ready 96 deaths 3 days ago. I‚Äôm used point. almost always sort comments threads |*Controversial*| that‚Äôs generally find unbiased viewpoints. Nice. includes Moderna vaccine. assume get approved 40m number. Nobody seems know many doses we're making monthly, probably even important. figure losing 900k going make millionaire homeless? make sense. logic, assume everyone ever millionaire going buy super expensive house super expensive crap. that's ignorant say like that. Someone definition millionaire, needs million. could lose 900k, 45k house. still barely okay home. There's great effort made disguise/invisible-ize huge governmental assistance benefits programs geared toward middle class time publicizing, politicizing, making humiliating governmental assistance benefits geared toward working/poverty class. Minnesota that, tell, many care keeping plans. fact, night bars closed lockdown, ton morons went ""last chance"". maddening. 

My husband uninvited family mom's, told mom we're coming. children over, attending. 

These scary uncertain times. neighbor 16 people house month ago. Nine ended positive COVID, including wife. ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù running Lowe‚Äôs Home Depot supplies redo porch.  I‚Äôd say India certainly fuck containment nearly hard west take massive differences poverty rates account, yeah article iffy simple Excellent! Ya scary. recently recovered antibody test came back positive negative covid test. sure long immunity last, I‚Äôll definitely see get vaccinated. virus literally ruin couple weeks, addition long term effects take time heal. Pot calling kettle black here. I'm curious, there's 12 million confirmed cases US, there's probably least 60-80 million actual cases.

how much impact expect 20 million vaccinations pandemic? seems ramping quite quickly. could round vaccines put fire out, take time that? downplay/stall first, put lot pressure WHO, EU etc restrict air land travel, thus ensuring speedier early international spread. 

Facts. 

May due pure incompetence childish face saving, plenty ""nothing see here"". Mind you, excuse governments could see mess coming planes nothing...for months proved one fact, 
There dumb people West East. New York outbreak March. long take figure asymptomatic people transmit covid? virus airborne? time making sure hospitals collapse? 


The beginning chaos. may delayed telling world maybe month due understanding asymptomatic, incubation time, designing tests, keeping hospitals tanking, getting PPE. 

But locked January step basically guys shit hitting fan move. 

They locked 8 billion people. Everybody basically stayed home three months. yet armed information, praised Xi sat hands. literally took CDC single handed lay go off, liar. Yeah. well probably bit stretch. certainly staggeringly failed though. Taiwan full anti China propaganda can't trusted. here, stocked 2 weeks rush, partly mum lives Christchurch earthquake realized need stay home 2 weeks need go anything could strike time. [laughs Vietnam‚Äôs China‚Äôs vastly lower death rates per capita] existential crisis looking void. Thank you!! awesome! I‚Äôm sure contrast going grow bigger time. vaccinate COVID-19, can't cure stupid.

Even family, I've staying away months insisting come (locally) Thanksgiving dinner. Two seriously immunocompromised. One mom, 70s. One's pregnant, last one husband. me, guy works mass transit daily praying none people get sick.

I'm seriously considering telling making story one co-workers tested positive. far (we quarantine one person already exposed, tested negative week quarantined good measure).

This kill thousands more, travel people mixing desperately sake family gathering followed another one funerals. Louisiana made big trip early March. First aid supplies, whatnot. checkout lady said ""I know for, ready."" honestly, never changed here. People glad over, cases time high. Unfortunately people unable act best interests outside immediate circle. Absolutely people need care close token yearly visit time peak pandemic (so far) good time it. 

Dying hospital without visitors +/- tube throat pretty shit way go well. 

Reschedule. another time year hospitals already overwhelmed. Use technology. care someone creative ways meaningful token dinner. 

The real issue US guidance, responsible adults make tough decisions. can't contain certainly could controlled more. worst already inevitable moment looks like things get much worse it'll go months. 

Spare thought healthcare workers Christmas. work grocery retail independent mostly sells natural channel. Many manufacturers reducing offerings focusing top 15-25% dollar earners. supply chain mostly in-tact, less variety shelves categories. article mentioned ripples supply chain, would agree with. chain relies many people, people get sick, things slow down.

There also shortage packaging materials jars, cans, plastic containers. vendors everything need make products, preferred containers put in. Related, usually sell flats mason jars, unable source several months now. am, understand completely. AMEN funeral homes raking cash 2020 wouldn‚Äôt consider ‚Äúvery well‚Äù, certainly passable especially consider response economic downturn terms wage subsidies bit discipline

Full blown lock months ""just bit discipline"". add Ken 'You can't close schools pandemic' Paxton hamstringing TEA list. moment mean nothing job, job begins mean nothing you. see lot career changes 2021. Good thing Nancy held relief get $1.2 trillion friends. know communist motto 1 100 me. Nah man heard antivaxxers? mean could let die, worst idea  really look like going get worse worse vaccine saves day. failure human cooperation. haven't. great point! I'm one dismissing people's problems here... lol OP actually right redditors cannot handle wrong

Every redditor armchair XYZ-ologist thinks IQ median That‚Äôs good point. hope determine previously infected people don‚Äôt need save people. Would really cut timeline down. Guerilla marketing sounds right alley üòä European here. Can't agree more. requires discipline, whether little lot. attack smallest aspect miss main point. Many Americans discipline what's needed manage corona virus.

Why try learn mistakes successes countries? Instead Americans saying right want need follow corona virus regulations... affect next person? taking pride country people, take hour inconvenience (at best) wearing masks out. traveling exposing many people. things keep fellow country people safe?  come.

But children really much less risk serious complications far know. problem could also solved empathy rather fewer rights. first hand access review data. pretty solid background dabbling medical science. 

Sorry I‚Äôm gunna go scientist one. kidding. know woman makes teddy bears. made big deal calling essential worker kids hard time pandemic teddy bears make feel better, hence practically first responder. that's said here. close end. that's said, response this. realistic, start unsafe think near end aren't. absolutely scariest, chilling part analogy 200,000 cases *the wind* tornado, actual monster itself. Things bad right haven‚Äôt seen truly terrible going get average age African residents barely 20, obesity epidemic. There's probably millions asymptomatic cases throughout Africa, overall youth continent results low death rate compared rest world. well .. virus surge more. going travel time soon. Heck, even decide virtual thanksgiving. 

But others want take risks, freedom, long affect me. can't get stay home ... thing avoid crowds much can. least amazon doordash. won‚Äôt help point, anyone isn‚Äôt convinced yet call ‚Äúfake news‚Äù what‚Äôs problem that? Slow steady wins race mate... get one step time. Pfizer begun trials children another one (I think J&amp;J) Things lot easier execute impunity people listen you. hard take seriously article written vampire. Please refer previous comment. Lol 

What know top epidemiologists vaccine developers, don‚Äôt know? 

Seriously, wanna know. qualifications make statement. want inheritances spent effing swear family 3 hour drive away want daughter come Thanksgiving since it'll 3 families worth people (my mom &amp; grandfather live together, uncle wife kids, sister husband kids) I'm far away.

I've declined invitation 4 times already. many times Thursday? Probably least 4 more.  Right, article people getting PTSD struggling us ICUS patients dying. That‚Äôs fucking point. mild symptom covid floor. fuck reading right now? I'm talking obesity epidemic case. referring ""needs"" potentially met wherein totally feasible us grow crop feed everyone choose not.  Link  Rite Aids Walgreens now, granted I've heard too. insisted vaccine would cost thousands &amp; government would sit idly subsidize anything.

lol, move money around fund wall, move around fund vaccinations well. military delivering vaccines FedEx UPS bungle deliveries time. I'm sure people know this, vaccines adult consumption only. Kids - even 18 apparently small children - make one fifth population US. Therefore, talk ""not everyone needing vaccinate slow down"" becomes, adults need vaccinate there's nothing yet kids. 

As parent toddler assumed we'd get three needle pricks. Appreciate info suggestions. rule currently, I'm one allowed, need bring everything possible needed, can't leave come back, cant provide food. I've packed everything suggested, plus more. Since cant feed I've got bread, meat, cheese sandwiches. Pepperoni sticks, yogurt, trail mix, drinks, crackers, etc. 

We're worried Covid hospital, problem family members understand we're pandemic. Upset us gone anyone's house since March. Upset get hold baby although whatever go wherever please care current rules.

They're worried getting baby sick, would hold baby second let them, they're worried missing holding it. 

So, we're going lock winter, thing, visit backyards March April nice enough out. Let's settle 'they're malevolent.' unknowingly asymptomatic pass someone dies serious case getting less 65 good health.

you're (not) good egg... Dude ahead time. agree. Hospitals still crisis. Pfff, government seriously, wonder wasted money expensive lock downs work well. Ok, let's reduce taxes get rid healthcare. Might well get rid education, police fire services :) capitalism fill void. person replied asked question answered. 

Most people know this. Everyone know caught haven‚Äôt died experienced mild symptoms. I‚Äôve many situations pandemic (going beach, spending time around family/friends, traveling) haven‚Äôt sick once.

This virus doesn‚Äôt make people afraid enough stay house time. Deal it. Brushing teeth goes human nature. Going medical check ups goes nature. go way eat balanced diet goes human nature. Shopping inside grocery store rather gathering/hunting/foraging outside goes human nature.

We things time goes human nature. That's makes us higher beings animals. override Natural part things think need done: brushing teeth building cities. Social Distancing, year, around world, simply another great feat accomplish. Anyone saying ""Yeah goes human nature"" never seen majesty Great Pyramids. go nature accomplish 8 Wonder World: socially isolating world beat global pandemic.

However, research also shows children catch virus shed viral particles, older children likely young kids pass others. Scientists say reasons trends unclear, policy implications older children article also Washington post sources.

WHO: still understand makes Bill Gates authority pandemic. funds science help. *do* work, funds it. Fuck you, shit talk like that? Judging spelled centre- perhaps countries tests differently. US nose swab standard - flu. Vaccines take years perfect. everything slow this. attitude part problem told many people negative tests means absolutely nothing. possible test positive within hours negative test. life-long medical lockdown way compares struggles European Jews World War 2 trapped basements attics camps constant fear persecution. maybe one needs perspective? Yep got lighting, felt lucky. going back school soon That's kinda point though, it? Smart people know really hard. simple-minded people trouble giving normal routine view ""hard"". fuckin easy. Stay home. Cover Face. Respect people's lives. New Zealand, Taiwan Australia nailed it. someway implement done countries. UK shambles since way hit shores. prime minister hiding fridges dodging meetings months. 

We weren‚Äôt required wear masks 5 months original lockdown. Airports weren‚Äôt closed still aren‚Äôt testing airports, asked isolate two weeks returning certain countries. 

Our contact tracing systems waste time ¬£12 Billion (with ‚ÄòB‚Äô).

To honest I‚Äôm surprised numbers low are. last days average ~2,000K/day. Thanksgiving coming, think safe say number rise ~3,000/day middle December. see. thanks explanation YES. I'm tired covid deniers people calling fear mongering. people need denied medical care. think big deal, deal home get infected covid, medical emergency hospitals space deal with. states living like normal since April Lol, like medical system? Come across border break leg... see much lie xray costs XD sure can‚Äôt reply without comment getting removed again. guess need explain couldn‚Äôt care less think am, thanks sending Buzzfeed article really drive home point ~100 people side effects 100% fucking dipshit. also can't ignore fact people may hesitant go restaurant anyway, acting like keeping everything open going save places kinda foolish imo. Holy shit Tom Hanks!? give up. really don‚Äôt understand difference going school sitting front screen nothing day, don‚Äôt know else say you. Yes, 5.5 hours common elementary school time length. A: disagree content law well regardless, happened person spreading content put disclaimer government's ""fact-checking"" rather completely censored, similar disinformation markers twitter dishing daily president trump. Nobody went jail it, let alone political opposition unless US free speech well, dont see makes us less democratic. 2nd criticism reddit also local forums HWZ(Singaporean LIKHG) facebook, government must seriously blind havent caught on, watch-out statement needed.

B: 2nd mentioned, difference members government sue slander, like members public other, person question shared link accusation PM, thus prepared defend court presenting evidence, dont see issues that.

C: read article know forbidden host Joshua Wong, needed police permit since holding political event. deliberately ignored advice opted serve sentence instead paying fine. agree sentence little harsh, clearly case self-martyrdom rather political oppression, followed police's advice gotten paperwork order wont happened. think cause government pro-beijing, also deported pro-beijing personalities holding events here. want neutral take sides. Springfield, Springfield, hell town! COVID rates life expectancy down!!! (Props know) Europe, many countries masks mandated since weeks months, yet cases still continued rise.

I know there's argument people wear properly, according article, either people USA obedient obeying mask mandates, secret US cases started decrease there. New Zealand must ""the East"" then. Despite 'leaks' border, quickly stamped out, everything open since early June. Kids school. Life essentially normal except travel outside NZ anymore. Anyone coming NZ mandatory 14-day quarantine nice hotels converted quarantine residences managed military. capacity around 6500 people quarantine one time. Slots must booked online, try get flight match. 

This sustainable there's vaccine. works. COVID-19 seems disabling young healthy people higher rates flu, though. I'd really rather risk reason someone else becomes disabled. Covid-mink virus extinct Yup pretty bs. Reminds white people think Asians woke zen many Buddhists. üòÇüòÇ okay ur obviously fucking around first, I‚Äôm gunna lie. Crisis happen naturally, global pandemic happen administration. Thank wisdom mr president antimaskers main reason test gives information level virus one point time. person could infected enough virus yet register test. Or, person may become infected hours days taking test. Also, tests 100 percent accuracy. saying makes sense, sense younger people older people get vaccinated order stop spread.

&amp;#x200B;

But we're talking get first, older people/at risk people.

&amp;#x200B;

Think large family, grandma, mom dad, 5 children household. 3 vaccines available. would give vaccines to?   Honestly wtf even get twice? I'm fucking Healthcare clinic well home visits. Abide masks whatever takes minimize risks gotten sick. picture March borders started closing... least got airport right guess. didn‚Äôt test 304 people. 
There may 7 people infected. least case, 304 people quarantined. hadn‚Äôt been, significantly seven people may capable spreading virus across country. 

My husband day 8 quarantine right now. He‚Äôs tested total far 15 times, work, last one 24 hours flew, like several people article. Nobody flew identified Covid, never Covid symptoms. still, wait one week go public, sleep room join meals. sucks lot ways, like country way. 

Testing substitute quarantine. 

Testing substitute quarantine. Omg preach it. Lol, even read you? Pathetic. China contain Covid. rude kinda deserve lol Dude smoking it? see numbers japan Korea lately? Even hk mini outbreak.  I'm telling lockdown Victorians experienced way compares life-long medical lockdown many patients around world. know like, attempt spokesperson Victorian Victims hilarious. now, imagine another 20 years it, worldwide. Yet cheerleading whole ""you understand"" bullshit. Hundreds thousands dead summer 2021, countless rendered disabled aftereffects virus, say nothing ruined families missing one family members healthy one year ago, even entire families make all.

Things never get anywhere near normal ever again. Things going lot worse normal possibly rest lives, considering bad normal was, awful times live through, die during.  opportunity take vaccine, Trump said worked, would experts said would. reason take HCQ, experts said best drug take. They'll claim fake nurses intentionally killed grandma get funding something. dog died day :( Okay vaccine rollout plan regards to?

There several, lol. specific.

Those generalized estimated dates. way dated phase three trial data released explicitly states subject change (because it‚Äôs reference anything üòÇ)

So, run along guess. Lol Well, we're halfway there.. thankfully yet, vaccines hopefully way less incompetent president incoming, might see light day. Thank creating this! made chart like manually photoshop months ago lol work healthcare scared. Even patients traveling planning big family events. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hoax, simply cannot see COVID real touched them. It‚Äôs like watching blind people walking cliff. hope wrong miracle, Christmas nightmare. statistic IHME hasn‚Äôt right once. Also, things go back normal relatively safe so, nobody likes masking distancing.  Thank service, telling person go fuck themselves. Taiwan fuck per press release released themselves. confirmes limited h2h mid jan via PRC intel taiwan wont happen normal brain defense mechanism.

Saw document 2WW old tank commander recalled battles told, well. Theyve got orders attack heavily defended hill? ""Oh fuck me, poor bastards, shitload kick bucket"". us. Them.

Its normal healthy. cant live constant pressure fear. Optimism drives us forward, drives inventions progress. Dude, tell BS explanation already. incredibly thankful did, especially family ends fine even Thanksgiving dinner. Yep thats exactly done. 14 day quarantines. Covid tests tell exposed coronavirus. reveal positive coronavirus. negative test means nothing. Testing negative means **time test** test positive coronavirus. negative test substitute masks distancing, White House, aka dangerous place earth, shown us. would definitely absent-mindedly wearing mask. Instead use disinfectant wipe wet fingers or, leaving that... go refrigerated meats section rub plastic one packages lol absolute brainless nonsense gets upvoted sub! Think it‚Äôs safe thanksgiving 3 people? compare neighbours ok? BOring there. Gotta entertain somehow. way nicer huge reason see family newborn. Newborns stressful learning means things get want other. 

Family thinks know better add pressure perform better know baby wants better fucking nightmare. 

My father law newborn would cry ""maybe hungry?! feeding her?! What's wrong?! colick?!"" almost killed him. 

A super helpful app used ""Baby Tracker"" (it outline parent holding baby icon). set alarms making sure kid eats, sleeps changes diapers. helps keep track days newborns wild helps figure child wants little faster see ate hour ago diaper 4 hours. Life saver. Oh! sync data multiple phones everyone page! looking pure totals, bit bad shape totals. Infection per capita, terribly that. percentage people's test coming back positive, terrible. People right compare situation countries point much crappier doing. statistics take account differences population, do, numbers still terrible.

Edit:. Grammer RemindMe! 90 days Ask /u/totalriches97 winter went.

Predictions -

* someone close get sick significant impact you. 
* thinking pandemic shift oh come, always show up, i'm truly amazed dedication. That's amazing. Hopefully &amp; NZ's luck continues holiday season &amp; beyond! :D super-shitty news you: 50's early 60's, CIA ran secret program Army spray radioactive particles entire cities - east St. Louis Winnipeg among - experiment.

Think cockamamie internet weirdness? Go ahead, saying agree agitated imbeciles - thought I'd sling interesting side dish horrifying reality accompany entree mass hysteria. live half hour drive away anything, public transport here. people, car absolutely necessity need afford car want survive. I‚Äôve watched multiple family members slowly painfully die cancer brought habits many others partake ‚ÄúI want body.‚Äù many people agonize every covid death still partake bad habits. hypocritical. No, didn‚Äôt. pretty sure information Covid even within China‚Äôs borders absolutely biased, unreliable, manipulated controlled CCP. don‚Äôt believe anything government tell me.  Maybe lowering cost living cost housing cost houses. talk inflationary policies also hurt middle class. Get it? want win perspective make topic lowering cost living deflationary policies. increases purchasing power time money worth instead LESS. within four rows, yes. It‚Äôs really airflow problem. airflow plane far Covid concerned probably good restaurant movie theater. Fly responsibly, dine responsibly, watch movies responsibly. 

The problem negative test doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre infected. means didn‚Äôt sufficient viral load indicate positive test. happens 100% people tested day get infected. Remember though IHME model wrong EVERY SINGLE prediction far. I've sub since March constantly producing nonsense predictions come true Well brag neutrality born Switzerland first word was, ""Meh."" free you‚Äôre one grubby socialist countries keep telling about.  ROC claims independent PRC. KMT DPP agree that. Taiwan follow province measures instead sent crew evaluate situation independently decided do. results super similar. Taiwan better result vast majority provinces Ahh. fun comment revisit Total misinformation/propaganda Trump's mouth bit ""let people leave Wuhan internationally"". Jan 23rd, last flights widely reported, day cancelled New Years. expect that? ""A strange game. winning move play."" Stay home Christmas parents another. I‚Äôm T1D. Really hoping March group. one september. Starvation increasing globally real devastating. I'm also anti vaxer keep getting voted saying want wait 1 year everyone else first get theirs. People understand first anything especially rushed good thing least one revision real world real world variables perfect lab setting. add ""silent majority"" bit. 
Melbourne city little 5 million people, handful protests four month lockdown..none couple hundred people... Sometimes less 50.

I theory population's willingness endure lockdown peacefully directly linked much goodwill bank started. Although like complain best them, Australians whole pretty satisfied way live governed.. lot goodwill spend. awesome Honestly quite shocked news Myanmar year... Buddhists violence, fighting!? Aye aye, crazy neighbor. literally everything open test cities millions cases pop up. doesn‚Äôt matter person Reddit ‚Äúbelieves‚Äù. got test says 100% safe

lol, bought test results. Trust nothing, trust one.  Yeah it‚Äôs stupid fucking article honestly. way could even test even test many?  Yep. Can't wait see 50-70+% positive like 300,000 new positive tests every day! bar stayed open...

Seriously thing fauci warns seriously indoor congregation. country 95 million sharing land border China 35 deaths. How‚Äôs geographical position, Germany many deaths? Source? (Not don‚Äôt believe you.) I‚Äôm sorry hear Meanwhile America hear Europe things somewhat control decided ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù traveled summer went bars. Doesn‚Äôt seem like either place much right last months. Seriously, Thank done. pneumonia 5 years ago knocked ass. know easy! Shot went much earlier that. Evidence showing abnormal increases pneumonia states much January. China spoke already possible contain it. ""stories"" like foment proud, ignorant displays. ""See mah story tha nooz?""

Americans crave attention momentary pleasure anything. Good job, America. contained covid China. responsibility contain country, falls leaders. country blame. paper suggests potentially less severity covid. says nothing immunity. saying yikes even know define scientist is? literally think software developer 80s-90s means understand lab science. person putting stock opinions rich guy (Gates) scientist spend entire career focusing one thing (Fauci), saying yikes *me* talking ""girl"" shit? Give fucking break. talk like god damn misogynistic teenager air superiority even Donald fucking Trump would envy. ""yikes?"" I'm fucking yikes squared. 5 year old online kindergarten year follow teachers instructions get back later assignment do, needs help time still hangs like trooper never misses meeting tries best engage. sucks president can‚Äôt take G20 well 5 year could, glad he‚Äôs way out. remember Applebee‚Äôs group 3 friends. Last social interaction restaurant many months ""The first cases detected U.S. March year, growing exponentially fall. October, virus burned nation""

Damn, history repeats 102 years later. learn. Nurses spend far, far time providing actual patient care typical doctor comes in, asks questions, orders test medication, they‚Äôre next one.

Doctors wouldn‚Äôt SHIT without nursing staff behind them. show week, Chris Hedges talks Dr. Margaret Flowers Covid-19 pandemic catastrophic response public health crisis America's for-profit driven healthcare system. Without national coordination, universal free national health care, Americans faced uneven absent care due hospital closings, reductions hospital beds services. 

Lawmakers hospitals administrators compete purchase basic supplies leading manufacturers jack prices. mercenary nature for-profit health care system also means many Americans distrustful health guidelines refuse get tested.  

Dr. Margaret Flowers retired pediatrician advocate public universal health care, advisor board Physicians National Health Program. going difficult doubt 95% publish peer-reviewed study data It‚Äôs standard lot countries contact people seated within six rows person test positive. That‚Äôs falls line similar guidelines contact tracing. Normally people you‚Äôve within 6 feet ten minutes contacted. 

I think everyone quarantine taking flight. don‚Äôt make rules. No. think there's anything death thats bad, though believe we'd prefer stay alive. False optimistic understand obstacles still get time. currently looking across United States find nurses help care patients,‚Äù said.

They‚Äôre gonna find virus surging everywhere. Providers choose won‚Äôt work state doesn‚Äôt even take basic steps slow spread. folks r/conservative say people sub sadists.. lol. 

Should give clue gotten bad done (I'm Australian) leaders every state territory taking advice best scientists country. straightforward path taking constantly evolving. science evolves, decision makeing. cracks system, followed hard lockdowns. people generally willing follow advice, know beating virus done successfully seen New Zealand.

And lifting mask requirements state, sick wearing masks, 20 days without new covid case. I‚Äôm stealing dumb Facebook thanks.  I'm going dead, unique issue, it? wife it, got two days later. Social isolation hard adjust spend life. spend time changes. time yourself. time home. time immediate family. Pick one two people keep ‚Äòbubble‚Äô stay sane. FaceTime / hangout / Skype calls. life hold? Racist say someone resistance covid? That's odd kind racism. Groups resistance based history pandemics area. There's paper U Tokyo suggesting this. Google around. picture black white understanding it.

No shit, nothing ever black white. amazing civil liberties lack democracy (Hong Kong, ranked freest place world ten year running). 

...You mean Hong Kong currently dealing massive riots amounts civil unrest **because freedoms population wants?** Hong Kong? really great example great place lack democracy. literally rioting shit right want able control leaders. three people used democracy amass power political legitimacy.

And say right head take away used ""to amass power"". Two people committed mass genocide became dictators, third got voted office largely back gross mishandling pandemic. bad Trump may be, way even remotely comparable Hitler Mussolini. Seriously. human being. US currently around 12.4 million cases still rapidly rising 7 day average new cases approximately 173000 new cases per day. even without amount new cases rising anymore around 6.75 million additional new cases end years. Considering need 2 doses vaccine believe 20 days apart least years vaccine hardly measurable influence amount infections. around 20 million cases US easily possible end year. confirmed cases assuming rate new infections change. Currently rapidly rising. Add undetected infections fact still take vaccine becomes widely available would guess 70 million completely realistic. 70 million? always say ‚Äî I'm optimistic pessimistic. I'm realistic. person never said overcome this. will. However, talk vaccine close seems give lot people sense woods. Hundreds thousands people likely die vaccinations go wide enough things get somewhat back normal. woods. hope, can't let people think start letting guards unfortunately lot suffering way gets better. rip I‚Äôll never forget day. work read NBA season cancelled. city announced schools would closed 2 weeks March Break. boss told wouldn‚Äôt coming tomorrow. I‚Äôve working home since, back office once. It‚Äôs fucking crazy. Dad COPD vented tonight. Mother too, mild. Pregnant sister drove state.

This virus fuckin bullshit, get friend. states (apart SA NSW managing small outbreaks back 0/single digits per day) forgotten covid exists. kind headlines coming (Perth hasn‚Äôt single case community transmission months) know getting vaccines pregnant nursing yet either? newborn go back teaching person maternity leave I'm hoping need quit pumping milk get vaccine. Even better would milk passed amount protection.

I imagine plenty healthcare workers otherwise front line vaccine might pregnant nursing hope one lacks opportunity get lack data. purpose? seems trump attempting use China kid sheild criticism. calling Chyna Flu spurred attacks Asian Americans. Trump withdrew American pandemic experts China years ago he's really blame many levels. world knew years ago China likely hotspot new viruses. Even Hollywood knew making movie Contagion. west people ground China help contain it. Trump fired guys. blame game there's lots blame share.

Edit : adding Rick flair woooooooooo! rest would clear way people like would much better. reason there. people traveling pleasure ramp pandemic.   Kern County California (one Republican counties state), county legislator unanimously voted fund [a $300K+ program offer $25 gift cards every covid test taken stipulations person must lowest 35th percentile income-wise county take test day, take test many days like earn money day.

This probably case Kern California strict limitations reopening whole, county voted 54% Trump election. People absolutely don‚Äôt care. Even Bay Area, took pretty seriously low-ish numbers people done caring. They‚Äôll wear mask they‚Äôll still go eat three times day. 

I think people like ‚Äúwell, there‚Äôs stimulus coming, everything back open, hospitals capacity, haven‚Äôt gone hospital 10 years.‚Äù It‚Äôs stupid can‚Äôt blame anyone fatigued, given $2000 month since March really wanted keep us home, federal gov not. Shit...which city? I've saying something like months. pandemic shined harsh light things wrong American society. complex system symptoms contributing collapse. majority workforce lives paycheck paycheck, little savings, can't afford lockdown. affordable childcare, everything privatized, working parents put pressure schools open need someone care kids. Food deserts thing, kids eat they're school. schools shut down, municipalities know there's chance many students eat, especially parents work. Companies convinced workers virtuous come even sick, want pay sick time deal covering absences, visibly ill people still going work. Couple rampant anti-intellectualism, generations defunded school systems churning barely literate kids test-heavy for-profit education system, media functioning substitute critical thinking skills, general disdain told seems core belief system end shit storm. really covid19; monumental failings society. No, sadly not. summer Europe much better, last month we've done much worse. Cases deaths exploded. moment we're even (per capita) look day day. US still rising though, whilst Europe stabilized may going bit. look totals start, US still worse. yes control. think, controlLing pandemic lunatic  California trip to, live start school soon (for college)

I plan wearing mask faceshield airport hope im fine Alternative science.  long pay insurance) Man, would think plague inc game mine would real. Leaving ""personal responsibility"" clearly abject policy failure. Turns millions millions people recklessly irresponsible selfish.

And entirely predictable. know they‚Äôre lying? telling much important issues getting people wear masks? already freaked f watching China build hospitals days. stocked last 2 weeks February. one noticed disinfectant wipes hand sanitizer scarce. 

My last in-person day work last day February freaked eff meeting many people in-person. shake anyone's hand. hermited home stockpile. 

So missed craziness March 11. already going crazy awful everyone else thought **I** crazy February. craziness outside finally matched craziness felt alone inside. Every country border. happens airport instead gate house highway.

It‚Äôs literally requirement accreditation, it‚Äôs also useful mechanism theoretically making things easier students. Many us surprised hear students would prefer three hour lecture three multiple choice quizzes instead 1.5 hour lectures low stakes assignments alongside exams (so bad exam grade isn‚Äôt badly affected). sucks we‚Äôre struggling ways help students beyond going ‚Äúok don‚Äôt turn anything!‚Äù

So really, it‚Äôs going noticeable effect genes carrying on. there‚Äôs optimism subreddit thriving Supposedly anticipate 10% year compared last. militarily? think Australia.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Shoot, right death rate. misread that. another link past 7 days. Florida indeed appear better average. midwest insane. Stay safe. Meanwhile, city shooting cell phones inside illegal warehouse parties, hanging crowded bars restuarants without masks. - feel safe cause servers masked up.

I sincerely hope everyone tells friends loved ones much mean Tgiving, cause lot people wont ever see again. get it, don‚Äôt care human death suffering completely selfish lack compassion empathy. understand this, don‚Äôt keep emphasizing this. Canada got half Michigan day. revenue injections offset losses due coronavirus.

What losses illnesses US already neglects? losses lacking mandatory paid sick leave? think people thinking economy way are? don't. Thanks insight, spoke someone recently concerned enough ask physical violence home safe. Thankfully safe still would say verbally abusive relationship. 

My take away stressors pandemic, restrictions, financial hardship etc paired fact horrible job mental health country, surprising see DV rise. Glad hear people willing get counseling/therapy. defending abusers recognizing dont teaching people deal stress anger result crossing line emotional/verbal abuse put current pressure cooker pandemic. Yep . 100 people . Petition rename Fart Lauderdale. Culture one explanation, it. Iran's complete shambles they're best described 'If USA couped megachurches, complete controlled clerical democracy would result'. Culture help explain things else equal; else really equal. East Asia really. r/COVID19 also another reasonable place. kidding. concept hard people wrap heads around? Stay fuck home, full stop. applies everyone, ""everyone else"".  Currently Florida not. rate really bad bad midwest Florida currently better off. last days huge spikes though, likely state weeks behind curve Nice concern trolling Jerry Jones cares putting people seats fantasy world. Everything else comes second presumed higher, there's tell, 10x floating around solid basis, especially number tests done. even so, know even 10x true, still projects US 600,000+ deaths without counter measures. still extremely bad scenario (well, worse already is). 200 people would die could expect everyone know someone died. lot suffering go yet takes type personal knowledge prompt action.

People always way. huge motivator getting involved charities. Ask someone number one charity donate bet someone close died it. article refers two specific hospital systems one city. dashboard entire state specific regions. even read article? Oh remember exact moment read headlines forget anytime soon Place like too. see terrifying numbers 2 weeks. Hospitals gonna screwed guys know well anybody, Good News permitted r/coronavirus. know even leave daily thread anymore. place reasonable people gather. Sounds like sweet birthday gift! take it! they‚Äôre country letting everyone in. travel vloggers it‚Äôs country get hope right, careful still need leave home. try best mask sometimes visor ontop. Less half, they‚Äôre willfully ignorant would argue 99% news isn‚Äôt going affect much. Obviously 1% probably important, it‚Äôs important enough hear means. 

This entire post perfect counterpoint logic dangerous followed adults.

These oblivious people may ""happier"" they're killing everyone happiness. heard ""other 1%"" elsewhere, actually they're doing. Look, working government Wow , scary people want actually live don‚Äôt hide basements Anyone needing medical help reason harmed overcrowded hospitals. It‚Äôs like feeling lump somewhere thinking ‚Äúoh no, might cancer, better go doctor.‚Äù case, though, need work harder together, half population thinks it‚Äôs choice follow mandates not. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's large part population feel falls susceptible idea ""fuck future self"". people refuse eat healthy cause *feel* fine now. People refuse exercise problem now. people barely sleep due refusal go bed still things wake (general bad sleeping habits). 

I feel like safe say vast majority people, least states, take lot preventative care health life decisions. often easier let *future* deal problems present leaves later. 

Same shit happens people eat shit know fuck tastes good now. people know they'll regret last couple drinks, anyway despite huge hangover next day. 

In situation, people whole accept reality dangerous unless everybody knows least one person close extremely struggling died. That's see least. then, people given much fuck pandemic write ""it's flu"" ""everyone exaggerating everything, bad all"". 

They listen evidence listen scientific proof. anecdotal  read book April quarantine everything describes true! might seem morbid, comforting read makes feel less alone situation now. here. work 800+ bed hospital city hit HARD last time. understand whole ""well change careers pandemic economic collapse"" response.

Good luck loved ones. That‚Äôll make lot first time snow drivers well world telling decades: american stereotype. Loud, dumb hopelessly naive comes great country is. stereotype rules country. working covid areas giving n95s wear, need take news. want lockdown never go out, nobody stopping you. get safe want be. we're together stuff died back April. what's even crazier deathtoll MEASURES TAKEN.

The fact people still get rotted brains fucking insane me. talk ""it's deadly."" 

First all, much deadlier flu everything shutting down. fucking morons. (not talking btw) west acted like east would shootings streets considering people called attack personal freedom gently asked wear masks.  Freeduuumb !! *Everyone wants know location* It‚Äôs results clinical trial get evaluated.

They‚Äôre reviewing manufacturing process, batches, quality testing, labeling, stability studies, animal studies data, raw materials data, lots information.

It‚Äôs vitally important order too. Floridian here. definitely approve this, one thing consider lot us already covid recovered, often little discomfort. I'm sure level bar occupancy example, 20 people coming thanks giving place papers showing antibody. lot people got moved on. sure contributes kind disregard. bad there? way see it, every job pay enough cover basic expenses. giving 40 hours time week, absolutely worth enough money provide decent, safe place live, decent food table, cover basic expenses. Whatever level pay - would differ depending location - minimum wage. cant keep running around like anything either. going kill people attitude. Fuck economy, let burn. Europe decided mobilise major threat, could achieved same.

Heck, *state* I'm divided 7 regions people could travel fair weeks there. time, UK still running air travel like normal. absolute madness stubbornness Europe, trying pretend living going big deal. Madness. ""They're going destroy virus exposing heat burning bodies!""

 - Futurama, ""Cold Warriors"". horrified amount damage virus (200k people getting sick every day, 2k people dying, thanksgiving coming...) I‚Äôm trying find one positive side this: regard herd immunity, ‚Äúas if‚Äù vaccinated 200k people day? Hey, remember time republican politicians got Rona took advantage tax payer funded Healthcare apprehend screamingly expensive drug therapies unironically systematically vote fetal cells? 99%+ survival rate. Give time. We're even November yet. $0 stimulus bailouts. Full tuition prices. Limited work availability. Gen Z getting screwed like millennials boomers raiding country dry.   Heh, saw bit.

Was Ronny Chiang? guy Daily Show?  guess forgot /s ;) told two friends...and told two friends...and on.... already seen bunch that. details hammered months ago. point unlikely manufacturers going looking competitors production capacity. 

Unless bunch vaccines fail and/or much less effective Moderna/Biontech vaccines. may see companies building capacity make instead start making effective vaccines instead. masks difference success failure lol. 

That's exactly say Sweden.   
Until they'll change mind pretend ""Sweden always encouraged masks usage"".  99%+ survival rate.  Okay, thanks. issue posting there, thought would let know thoughts: 

My intent behind posting may help people skeptical taking vaccine. know organization reasons like keep videos Daily Discussion thread, however, I ªm bit worried posting won ªt provide nearly much exposure. willing make exception, would really appreciate it. not, problem post instead. 

Thanks time! Looks fun Yup. 30 ICU beds. ICU stepdown/cardiac used another hotzone maybe another 30. problem ICU nurses. specialized nurse med/surg, ER, surgery, clinic, etc dropped even months training. Takes get beyond ""what fuck supposed this?"" stage. peak times dip back time? weather holiday holiday? mean start going back eventually right? chain hospitals infected nurses still working? going leftover turkey? rest world sure take note.

Oh, did. Pulling Paris climate accords Iran nuclear deal clear signal. Ugh, depressing.

I moved D.C. couple months ago work really wanted we‚Äôll remote 2021. already signed year lease feel stuck miss family much mom finished chemo March risk it.

I miss family cannot, good conscience, plan trip see family holidays. miss fucking much. responsible killing family member I‚Äôm surprised many people willing that. Hate thy neighbor Yup, horrifying, yet Texas continues vote people perpetuate disaster. safe WFH desk job, husband bartender. looking work probably another year. I'm trying figure out, folks like 100 days cases, cases again? happen island quarantine 14 days come back? I'm puzzled transmission days, ect. thought quite time much longer early reports limiting factor testing. expect see linear spread positivity rates go up.

In extreme short term may actually see cases go positivity go given people getting tested attend Thanksgiving events. 99%+ survival rate. least surge won‚Äôt say middle pandemic anymore, maybe like three fifths, 13/20ths vaccines. Statistical outliers. follow science not? hope immunization tracker well is, indeed. sure understood that, yes, Tux called Gentoo loves distro. Also this... hope get help people pick groceries pool items snot goblin touching, FYI. 

Just cook everything wash hands food prep (and *one more* smartass asks cooking salad). Cooked food safer pandemic anyways, COVID handle heat well. needlessly gendered line common misperception. college sending everyone home week.
We've planning since start semester. really wanted go holidays could left 2 weeks early, even bad idea. travel holidays, haven‚Äôt seen parents since day left boot camp sucks Yeah thats article. come batches, doses.  user name checks  bar restaurant, potential lock downs public health part business. Don‚Äôt like can‚Äôt afford lock down? Find another business. Yup. wish would go route studio decided Wonder Woman 1984. Debuts Christmas Day HBO Max for, think, month, standard theatrical release later. 

As spending Christmas alone year, like Thanksgiving, particularly happy news. think lot studios might surprised well would work long run short streaming window sometime next couple months, whether free subscription service like HBO pay rent individually theatrical release later truly safe. fact is, people need escape right things getting awful... can‚Äôt keep delaying way back normal fucking morons like üñïüèΩ . vaccine comes mask social distancing gone. you‚Äôre still scared could care less everyone else going back normalcy. Buckle up. ‚ÄúPersonal responsibility‚Äù always talking point. never made taken seriously. evidence conclusive can‚Äôt count people right thing. Enforcement necessary almost level cancer. directly affected it, loved ones yourself, become desensitized existence.

What worse witnessed shrug minor needed hospitalization.

Mom September. barely noticed super ill. Barely even cold. Yet lost sense taste smell, neither returned.

Having experience could change people's minds taking seriously. No, use ER insurance. Exactly. ok. Sometimes livelihood, quality life, connections others valuable elimination risk.

That allow things like driving cars, even though know roughly many people kill. Show happens often isn‚Äôt anomaly maybe I‚Äôll take seriously enough stop usually do. referring COVID bad, relatives 250,000 Americans might disagree you.  Old news. US military sent now.   literally $10k broke shit car died. know I'm helping make point happen, rarely. Wagyu turkey COVID? happened months ago. Clearly gone now! /s ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£ ¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•¬• tunnel going claim another 50,000 lives get there

That‚Äôs incredibly optimistic. United States‚Äô current death rate (1,510 per day last seven days according worldometers), 50,000 people die COVID United States Christmas. even that‚Äôs optimistic given rapidly cases rising fact deaths lag cases.

With FDA approval expected around May, 300,000 additional deaths United States current rate pointing to. plenty dollars home already. Bezos alone buy year's worth Australia's exports godsake, 7wks worth GDP.

Don't let distract thinking can't afford continual wars too, simple misdirection play. This. seems like Reddit full kind people tend promote views liberal way, making come irrational ideas beliefs. seemed get info news social media sources without questioning first even though things make article flat wrong.

I‚Äôm young don‚Äôt believe everything internet tells me. think it‚Äôs better listen actually scientist, researchers, experts say something like rather always listening media tells you. provide links statements Swedish officials saying strategy best?

[""The rest world went says Sweden‚Äôs Covid Expert.

It May. time Sweden 2,6x cases Denmark, 3x cases Norway 5x cases Finland.

[""Sweden says made 'total mistake' including

Unless course trying become PE teacher AG major. folks shit besides party. natural selection point reason? ones wearing masks excellent social distancing safety measures? *Void prohibited, exclusions may apply.* I'm sure that's plan. reading yesterday lot time needed vaccine development due actual work researchers, raising funds, recruiting enough volunteers, pushing paperwork bureaucracy. Part reason COVID-19 vaccines moved fast drug companies, governments, researchers basically dropped everything else focused COVID-19 vaccines. amazing bottomless funding worldwide attention scientific community. pay taxes US insurance $400 dollars month. also copays clinics deductible pay well insurance covers anything.

I'm told insurance coverage one better ones. 

Is canada like all? Whatever - I'm telling article said:

""The 40 million doses military distribute enough vaccinate approximately 20 million Americans. "" Yeah, we‚Äôll get honesty answers China, right? Ikr? true literally everywhere US. One thing Fed lead pandemic would would set ways measure report data, nation-wide.

It take thousands PhD candidates years sort stuff come solid stats. Glad finally realized mistake problem. admit, I've done ""heavy breath"" mask moisten fingers open plastic bag. I've also wiped moisture produce (and bought said produce, I'm monster, already planning buy it).

I feel bad that, I'm sick (I'm not, everyone says that) worry transfer via touch. buying nothing, last time bought pre-packaged stuff already starting go bad, money worse produce. first time incompetence? Apparently one realizes minute give fear, that's virus attacks beats you. fear real cause death. Ah ok, reason hate don‚Äôt look like you. Gotcha. One sister‚Äôs sons got sick week half ago tested positive. husband sick, too, refused tested. smartest thing could think of. took youngest son 4 day mini vacation, two sick, leaving fend themselves. came back Monday started exhibiting symptoms tested positive Wednesday. definitely already contagious decided go vacation. One friends church elderly lot underlying health conditions. He‚Äôs ventilator, doctors can‚Äôt keep oxygen levels even ventilator, he‚Äôs unresponsive. doctors told wife *will not* make *will* lose unless God gives miracle. 

His wife hospital COVID-19 wrecked body badly. relearn walk got better, rehabilitation center last month. gets come home Thursday, husband badly ... 

Some people won‚Äôt even get last thanksgiving. new case study New Zealand‚Äôs Ministry Health finds Covid-19 spread long-haul flights.  September, two international studies came conclusion. last month, Irish study linked 59 Covid-19 cases one seven-hour flight.  New Zealand researchers looked outbreak among passengers traveled 18-hour Emirates flight Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Auckland, New Zealand late September. Seven 86 passengers onboard later tested positive managed 14-day quarantine.  unfriendly skies! Would shake head commit genocide natives ? Support coups south america, list goes  number would exponential too...lotta patients, lotta beds/docs No, theres never extra supplement stimulus payments.

In opinion situation quite managed compared countries. Plenty ICU capacity, high mask compliance, low deaths. People seem split perfectly fine lockdown, understanding annoyed restrictions. understand depends shopping pattern personal preference. TP buy comes 9 packs. could buy 24pack different brand bottom says that. Gotta love racism Healthcare worker well. Already caught back April, probably work. second worst hit hospital state, absolutly dreadful chaotic. something want go I'm starting panic bit do. keep food table guess chief epidemiologist ""official"" enough 

Here saying strategy **It's better let seep slowly**. keep control take care harm society necessary. immunity could thus also relevant Sweden.  **We bit cautious using word** breathes little given question of, says Anders Tegnell.  basic idea probably starting become relevant see virus, **this need get**. control way.  demands action believes fire allowed burn?  like forest fires things, **if make burn little slowly carefully, make burn admitted herd immunity approach results approach became apparent. changed tune. abandoned holiday travel plans stories like this. could close half population according 
It's due conspiracies. low risk, decision harder high risk complications. Alright slickyslickslick calm many simiple matter availability 

Many rural hospitals frig capacity necessary RNA vax's J n J vax likely available area should.

1861 new cases yesterday. Yeah I'll take one available doctor's office/pharmacy (assuming effective, safe , etc) I‚Äôd put money people minimum wage workers never amount shit life. worthless fucks also going won‚Äôt take vaccine, rushed. millions millions people recklessly irresponsible selfish.

This whole ordeal quite mirror society.  Time start denying treatment anyone antimask Facebook posts. virus mutate season like flu, one vaccine protect us long time, maybe forever, similarly tetanus, hepatitis A&amp;B, chicken pox TBC vaccines. right seems like current vaccines work forever. aged well.

1861 new cases yesterday.

Has Slovakia started trace infections, plans new country wide tests, again? long schools open virus spread like wildfire. precautions matter kids school. It‚Äôs choice starve? Yes totally. Vaccines cause 5% death rate well life long complications many others. can‚Äôt say no, it‚Äôs safe, period. lie reason aren‚Äôt coming bc exposure positive coworker, aren‚Äôt sending message hadn‚Äôt known exposure , would ok gather? Good. hope gets spread around world. feel pro-humanity means sharing knowledge benefits us all. goal complete suppression virus virtually zero cases need worry modes transmission matter rare unlikely. get millions items frozen food week one contaminated enough virus goes infect worker important.

In west much person person airborne/droplet transmission couple people month catching virus packet fish fingers going move needle. worth worrying about.  Remember last time China tried hide coronavirus? Wuhan‚Äôs hospitals got destroyed number sick patients.  Well, me. Staying Thanksgiving seeing anyone that's video voice call. rest country risk lives want, me. Well, Florida. surprise. airlines offering free re-scheduling cancellations? idea small businesses work unemployment. guess small business loans too, big businesses gobbled lot claiming physical location small business.

And know state (Georgia) people applied ultimately approved took weeks months straighten out. people still trying fight unemployment they're owed spring. imagine elsewhere too, unemployment systems overwhelmed. Fuel air bomb. show up?  aware NY led democrats right? That's problem America, everyone wants blame cool thing blame moment. question ask much misinformation East (China/Russia) spread. Kroger offer option tip employees FYI, contactless can't give cash. yet. Thank sharing experience. hope things turn well family Frightening insane, people good time. Tut tut, whatever next. holiday perhaps.... meant: many deaths acceptable means LOCKING DOWN?

Saying ""zero"" fantasy land. still yet provide yours. Applying stats testing May NYC meaningful understanding testing numbers across country.

An ifr 0.23% nonsense. That's roughly percentage NYC population already dead time antibody testing cited.

The numbers using self-contradictory. Nice try George Soros. virus exposed flaws people system.. everyone complied would saying system succeeded Wakefield partially flooded army corps engineers. old road leads directly lake. man. It‚Äôs alienating. trust one bit help relieve student debt burden. hope I‚Äôm proven wrong, feel like people bliss Trump way office (which good thing, course) forgotten Joe Biden politically priorities not. problem ""basic expenses"" changes depending person. take train transit 1 hour 1 half hours out, changes cost living dramatically. people 1.5 hour commute acceptable especially gigantic house others 20 minute commute acceptable. Another problem lot people think 2-3 vacations year ""basic cost living"" others nightmare. people absolutely need car people don't. there's question lifestyle choices, like kids. really mind someone kids making money work mostly hope courtesy extended one day choose have. someone never chooses kids. disadvantaged. Many subjective factors like this. could use objective metric like CPI, count housing.

The fighters $15 minimum wage stupid. know enough money especially since $15 Canada USA countries. want clear consistent message pushes political change. least match inflation. get idea everybody's head minimum wage match inflation minimum rest elections debates over. What's true a) system rigged people top people bottom see real wages decrease year b) want give fighting chance.

When/if building house takes almost man hours. That's we'll see real change. robots build houses middle nowhere, even bungalows cut rates. Also. Since 50% people stocks never get ups (and downs) capital. Maybe government take away percent everyone's pay put indexed fund, seems people given financial education know this. poorer need literally cannot wait buy house, get emergency fund, pay debts etc., investing. need market right away every spare dollar touching 5+ years that's way lifted rising tide. implicitly saying dude trying hard enough. feels like personal attack already trying hard make situation better. lot people, said sounds like ""look, poor money"".

To try explain he's objecting to, concept frugality applies mainly disposable income non-fixed costs. frugal means choosing get Starbucks luxury car choosing buy smaller house. already point fixed expenses (healthcare, utilities, student loans, rent tiny apartment) taking 100% income, can't frugal way that. Costs risen wages not. year younger meaningfully harder time affording basics do. year younger going less less able apply concept frugality finances actually get ahead. I'm 40 shit sandwich people 25 eating right makes heartbroken because, bad dealing 2007-2008 meltdown early career, worse now. Meh. internet points. Thanks comment. certainly intend sound judgey holier thou must hit sore point. dealt way did. worked.

Right life back normal Wuhan - things live?

Funny ignored countries list ran China...... tho..... question ask much misinformation East (China/Russia) spread. Maybe, dual citizenship, would gotten hell Dodge months ago. They're cautious. mom got work new trainee sat right next her. Thx links really interesting. know honest. assume Denmark testing also asimptomatic persons well Germany countries tests simptomatic cases. places go test free simptoms (but contact infected) summer could get tested arrival airports railway station, sure still possible , thus maybe cases Germany reported. One possibility Denmark reports deaths delay ? Usually fatality numbers trail number cases weeks. Okay still... nothing. someone autoimmune disorder I‚Äôm pretty disgusted ownership. feel like little action take without jeopardizing job, ownership doesn‚Äôt take seriously. Contacting health department maybe? Vaccines supposed start administered mid Dec. help slow spread vulnerable Well people like pessimistic think bad things possible could may happen, anything good probably won‚Äôt. call realistic. tend agree, we've heard isolated reinfections mass reinfections. Zero. includes deaths consequence social disruption attempt slow spread. many deaths ok with?

And many years like you‚Äôd feel would take equal impact Spanish flu? stopped selling Lotto 649 deemed 'not essential' 

like matters, assholes Quebec Ontario always win big prizes anyways. Welcome....... real world. mention people think ok say ""I'm bad math.""  knew better avoid Black Friday shopping, even pre-pandemic times. current generation harder generation. 

I'm tired seeing said around Reddit. boomers white men. Even then, imagine expected support family + maybe staying married someone hated (divorce ok back then). 

Minorities, gays, trans, women easier previous generations. lot easier now. news, ICU beds germany almost full. know, ""did right way"", whatever fuck. I've China myself, expect go smell coronavirus there?

I Xinjiang pass cities we're ""closed today due bad smog"" wink wink nudge nudge. Unless kind investigative journalist there's much write home general suspicions. NICU.

Fucking outrageous. idiotic state idiotic country. Covid US years come Don‚Äôt remember happened last time China community spread? Given China‚Äôs density poor public health infrastructure, ability hide community spread. 1.2K month / 2 weeks / week, time frames could afford, plus proper federal plan would saved many people lives. goal Prez. mean, unicorn farts Europe either. UK elect Boris Johnson, basically Trump charming buffoon instead infuriating one (but still racist buffoon). like countries morons charge.

If could switch different voting style like Instant Runoff (which think would easier understand people - rank candidates best worst, unranked candidates ""I want person all) might better, nobody power wants that. current system favors them, easy get people worried ""the guy"" hard get fired ""your guy"". elderly people get information news (most local news controlled sinclair broadcast group), also don‚Äôt grasp concept photoshop deep fakes. Daniel Defoe Journal Plague Year, published 1722, described major personality types behaviors, limited awareness due 298 years ago. One subset believed this, ""Eat, drink, merry tomorrow may die."" bar/restaurants often. Life continued, like now; money enough. necessary manifest personality type minds concerned, startle effect gone, issues involved public policy set review, analyze, draw conclusions? time like yesterday.   Ahh yes classic, job stupid.if denied everyone health problem due personal choices , hospitals would empty ... People dumb . Except reason brains hardwired negative outlook world. apologize wanting family...

Just take precautions ensure carry there.  Sure plays role, scale mandated solution needs proportional scale problem. can‚Äôt simply pretend harm comes attempts slow spread this.

If guess, many years like would take Covid exact population-adjusted loss life compared Spanish Flu? Turds well apparently not. two interviews lined Monday I'm hopeful. One lab assistant I'll still get something like without actually around sick people. really wish could find job working home though. Dude stop. Yes, wearing mask simple thing do, change fact hate able see peoples faces, incredibly uncomftorble, depressing reminder whole pandemic.

Stop belittling people fatigued this. Exactly. Yep. similar two friends mine doing. work home kids supposed school home. it‚Äôs ‚Äúdifficult work‚Äù kids home day send local daycare sit front laptops masks on. It‚Äôs much worse kids every day much dangerous lot people can‚Äôt bothered actually parents. might also play it: signs point lauderdale...for epicenter Interesting, aware posted picture reddit. Exactly. Sacrifice one single day enjoy many many many days loved ones. tough choice average educated citizen. 

We‚Äôre find many uneducated average citizens are, sadly.

It‚Äôs inevitable... picture history books (digital) 50 years entire section Thanksgiving 2021 largest super-spreading event US rolls right Christmas, results begins show mid-Jan roaring February cold grips US.

We setting perfect storm perfect storms.

Too many think vaccine approval makes game many saying ‚Äúthe cure coming, matter?‚Äù 

This pandemic taught level uneducated citizens, regardless income/race/background/education levels etc. staggering. I‚Äôm fully aware it‚Äôs mental capacity issues, it‚Äôs still shocking sheer number people still side fence, completely ignoring proven science. Enjoy turkey legs.   good. get spend many future Thanksgiving together loved ones. well *in spite* capitalism, it. Plus also socialized medicine you‚Äôre helping ‚Äúcapitalism good‚Äù argument here. EU said countries getting proportional vaccines. Meaning can't give Germany none rest. I've heard really want overload reply totalriches97. 

I family members asthma, diabetes, old triple combos. point, actually care anymore, I'm worried them.

I curious many people taking pandemic seriously.  Fully depends carrier hubs. know North East seen major depression traffic hubs like ORD LAX. regional carrier work numbers remain relatively stable slowly increasing since August. TSA numbers want check bookings overall health air travel. 

I know least one regional carrier can‚Äôt keep demand, historically issues keeping demand. Let‚Äôs hope doesn‚Äôt age like milk estimated 50 million americans travel Thanksgiving. 

50 fucking million. crazy alot people dont get fact don¬¥t know clearly never tried crossing Tasman Sea small boat. 8 meter waves regularly windy. plenty cyclones approach NZ north. Yeah, USA anything close technocratic leadership since... Shit... 1920's back actual thing America? 


Apparently far off. looked check. gained strength later 30's 40's.  


But far namesake technocracy goes, really thing long time.  


NOW, authoritarian digital state encroached upon us via Silicon valley... It'll matter break leg can't get hospital treatment full people give fuck. That's exactly point. People getting help need lockdown make amicable. February would much better place right now. point people simply must fly around country next week cough other's mouths they're poor. people tired shit, they've gotten help, contextualize everything like reddit. want see families, want feel normal done shit. wish wouldn't. understand why. 

As shit goes get worse need turn other. already politics enough. blame people vote right think right live right places right brain power. I'm trying get early morning tirades root cause neighbor, leaders country system runs unwilling intervene way gives people expectations help future. 

If hand money right people sitting home, people wonder there's pandemic. that's bad. means changing system operate way means people going see 0.5% increase stock portfolio next quarter. They're willing let people die get sick maintain idea federal government can't intervene. Despite us getting new government next year, feel that's going remain case. hope happens, turn anger people top rather other. Yup. ""Live good, thirty years shorter expected, hey, thanksgiving/christmas dinner awesome"".  50 million ey? Seems like future elections divided then.

Darwinism say

1/2 * /s authorities force something, people fault dumb lot sub 90 IQ‚Äôs die much better position fix get ready COVID-2* Bringing deadly disease people little immunity authentic Thanksgiving reenactment.  people dying hospitalised they've vaccinated that's important. There's intention eliminate sars-cov-2. would possible. going become another seasonal virus milder course population develops pre-existing immunity vaccination infection. important thing vaccinate vulnerable adults risk complications. 

The seasonal coronaviruses cause common cold likely began coronavirus pandemics one point.  Walmart cancel black Friday last year? billionaires afford make less profit one fucking day? Yeah, US west. Germany example 100% people wearing masks public spaces, even work. would also argue Australia part west. point vaccines may best. fact lot low quality clinical research coming Asia beginning Pandemic. Research conducted western pharma academic medical centers ultimately led reductions 50% terms hospital days mortality. Seemed evil though hold secret meetings could spread virus around. ""higher authority"" say killing fellow church members fine? Depend, easier make distribute amazing step forward. reduce r number half using far better situation now. Depends storage manufacture though. starting set now, needed. That's late. Better overprepared all. starting set now, needed. That's late. Better overprepared all. Sweden followed neighbors, would lost 567 Swedes Norway‚Äôs death rate 56 per million vs toll 6,406 686 per million. Following Finland‚Äôs example would led 688 deaths rate 68 per million.

That‚Äôs ignorant statement don‚Äôt even know start. country (poland) able travel town town Christmas. hard able see family person least we've got zoom Mostly school children. cannot tell annoying airline commercials right now. Jesus Christ Well mainly referring china hey want see authoritarian regimes thats fine one would've ""put life hold"" 9 months everyone took seriously first months

but nope turn political issue US. even ppl still trying debate real lmao. ""refuse live fear""

This said last night. told them, like respect. see large snake, afraid give respectful distance. Need tell can't take vaccine then. remember Tom Sawyer getting pals paint wall something conning thinking fun (I need reread; decades). Anyway, Mark Twain knew American mind apparently.   able cancel plane tickets? dad bought sister plane tickets visit seem dodging concerns travelling visit them. noted fly mid-December Christmas time. Yet somehow population poltiticse virus claim hoax got relatively unscathed. Thats awesome can't wait feel relieved getting better ‚ò∫ celebration beer me! 70m voted trump despite pandemic. sort brushing away actually concrete facts better. Cambodia better Finland? ""they knew do, before"" actually list real measures took guessing.

Subsaharan Africa MUCH better Europe, even better much Asia. that? Sure they're young, even taking account much better.

There evidence may also genetic factor Japan example pretty high rates infection cell study. deaths. studies Japan far seem suggest coronavirus actually spread quite rapidly there, effect nothing like Italy example. Imo better name calling making remarks people's intelligence. Im going try positive recruit people implying good qualities. Australian Melbourne here. came lockdown restrictions slowly lifting. bad went 100 days. recording 23 contiguous day ZERO cases.

Sorry, boast.

Good luck mate! Don‚Äôt listen people man lol. Enjoy time family. Nah, there¬¥s big spectrum different opinions values East West conclusion doesn¬¥t make much sense. individualist collectivist countries. profits healthcare industries going huge though... Can't yank soft? Rookie. South Korea authoritarian guess? Taiwan too? According uncle something controlled evil shadow government created totally fake virus keep current potus plucky St Nigel Farage saving us all. something. Also vaccine made mind controlling nanotech dead babies change DNA, masks actually cause COVID (that's real) get fake vaccine.

He looks sane. fooled. Absolutely horrible. I'm sorry deal that. arrested putting danger. try October little effect? think fellow countrymen women need explain themselves. right thing. dont great luck dont want tempt fate. children one small percentage deaths. something happened done thst could would die broken heart. Well Sweden can't legally lockdown, economic impact never factor Sweden didn't.

The rest agree with. think actual economic impact (for countries) seen near future, take years entire picture. mean least getting tested. That‚Äôs hell lot people getting together thanksgiving doing. thing stopping number upper limits testing are. number people conceivably tested single day?  Churches secretly gathering along. don‚Äôt need vaccinate children protect them, need vaccinate children raise overall immunity levels.

We know best 50 percent people get flu shots. probably 40 percent US given damage leadership.

The goal make vaccine mandatory students, including college students, fall 2021. Put virus bed one want , wonder specifically request brand Upcoming vaccines approved safe kids, super-spreaders. November rain üò∑ agree. could we've gone made worse absolutely right could fixed toughing beginning month max continued travel restrictions mask wearing afterward. refuse believe people would incapable staying home month help stimulus check netflix. much time passed nobody cares anymore. general decadence West thing. includes (apart lack memory) hubris, ignorance dogmatism. say European.

Hubris: China totally locking city population 11 million, country seeing low increasing cases, official version big problem, get many cases, spread here, bad, measures needed. pure hubris. way believe unless believed Chinese (1) kind third-world savages need lockdowns stop simple virus wonderful Western healthcare would stomp like fly, (2) morons make mountain molehill. position similar throughout Europe.

Ignorance: one positions power West (and honest, people outside positions power) seems understand exponential is. see straight upwards trend logarithmic plot, even absolute values still low, means screwed nothing. rocket science know mathematics, really. yet, couple weeks hospitals overrun March-April, everyone saying problem, ICUs 40% whatever number, everyone saying ""wow, suddenly exploded, one could known!"" - trend change all: normal behavior exponential - growth accelerates point time, cannot keep it. summer, thing: one seemed notice lines logarithmic scale graphs regularly trending European countries, October/November things begin get hairy, people (including politicians) say ""wow, situation changed suddenly unexpectedly, seemed everything control getting new wave, need measures now!"" - normal exponential behavior.

Dogmatism: political thought West engulfed utopian capitalist thinking extent behaving like fanatics. seems like takes thousands deaths even think closing bars weeks, hey, individual freedom economy government close anything. criticized Communist utopian thinking, course good reasons, honestly kind thinking much better? opening totally non-essential leisure business become important significant loss human lives? system apparently, stop productivity (in non-essential sectors) months, totally screwed face horrible recession? sensible system? would say person's economic situation brittle bankrupted need stop working 6 months reason? normal theoretically richest, powerful countries world exactly situation (and again, I'm talking non-essential sectors, normal still need food, etc.)? Intelligence often defined ability adapt environment, system (Western liberal capitalism) cannot make even basic adaptations face change environment (closing businesses *on time*, dragging feet months lifting restrictions soon) intelligent system utterly dumb? society criticizing capitalism way seen fringe view?

As mentioned: utter decadence West whole. learning Chinese 5 years (although hard hell). fear things may get worse may need migrate point. hear you. really good hit hard spring.

This round, seems much intent saving businesses instead lives. Guess we‚Äôll see costs üò£ incompetent bunch assholes. Trying deflect blame people caught virus rather shitty hotel quarantine system implemented. didn‚Äôt learn Victoria‚Äôs mistake hardest deflect blame grand standing ‚Äúoh we‚Äôve done incredible job stopping nuclear corona blast decimating South Australia‚Äôs population‚Äù.

Oh please see smoke mirrors. good run USA.

At rate, Canada Mexico build walls keep guys in. Yes geographic advantage, Australia also got lucky. pandemic hit month later, 10,000s students China (Before China started lockdown virus running wild) would arrived border still open. botched Ruby Princess decision could ended lot worse did.

It nothing % Asians population everything geographic advantages, luck, serious lockdown attitude much Europe. Haha good thinking guys. Covid never find us here, weally weally qwiet telling masks don‚Äôt work

 would never say masks work.

I said seem stopped second wave Europe. mean SARS first detected '03, first eradicated, I'm guessing fairly similar. main reason Vietnam 35 deaths outbreak hospital. I'm fan homeschooling, I'm sure glad option year. Massive riots, protests, celebrations gatherings? good fam

Going see family thanksgiving? DARE Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha.

Messiah complex much? Better socialism!

/s  think it‚Äôs already happening, like week long waits get tested live. this, April? religion politics, public health. quarantining community otherwise? someone Taiwan, baffled CDC adopted system US Japan.

Why US behaving way REALLY shocked here. leave Even long covid cases, they're generally happening people age 25. Covid undoubtedly dangerous, fortunately vast majority kids handle ease, time even know they've it. risk side effect vaccine dangerous risk virus, tell us everything need know. trials see whether works effectively children would take years Look experience, always better make look like nutjobs. Unless idea never ever make public, never made disappear. Also, disappear gives sort legitimacy. 

Instead add even nuttier ideas associate fake nuttier ideas original ideas. nobody takes seriously. ones saying never keep virus out, contact tracing squash outbreak ASAP. There‚Äôs currently 5000 people 14 day quarantine due outbreak cluster 25. hundred thousands cases now, many countries keep contact tracing level required, far gone them. This. Even basic job would support decent family life. Nowadays, even two incomes push precariat. better? seem cartoonish idea military actually does. majority actually logistical. Sure they‚Äôre ringing doorbells, moving way shit around country everyday seem realize. 

It‚Äôs called industrial complex nothing. happens money, billionaires, hedge funds corporate empires run show drive decision making. politicians know well butter comes from. best fire season next 20 years

How optimistic. positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts asymptomatic cases.
 
Thats encouraging! freedom, long affect me

This remarkably short-sighted. people get infected, greater chance *you* get it. That's epidemiology 101.

As Amazon DoorDash, people infected, services suffer personnel overworked become infected well. Much worse happens medical staff. hospitals overwhelmed, people die can't get needed medical attention.

Do see that? Dunno worse.

What's happening US, Chinese governement tell Yeah right. New Zealand greatest government world supplant given European country would COVID free ""Where two three gathered, God there.""

Like, Christianity designed survive. Worship congregation important, important faith deeds. Pray secret, let God touch lives others actions. Heal sick. perpetuate plague.

Historically, Christians called lives ministry communities. They've served leper colonies, but, so, elect cut rest world. secret worship right, especially since livestream Mass service. need extraordinary ministers make housecalls deliver Sacrament Communion. think stop aunt Margaret yapping pooch. problem scale, thing save lock down. Masks fuck all. Best way spread Covid across country country full idiots. Link dont work live thousands miles away family accept see Thanksgiving likely Christmas well really hard me, do.

Lots people saying careful. what's careful staying home. know fuck Zenz I've Xinjiang, I've seen closed cities. Incredibly irresponsible. look forward going parties like next year, post vaccine, absolutely right now. Exactly. Lock doors two weeks nobody infected free leave. Infection breaks out? Looks like going get deal bar. Good luck! nonsensical hyperbole. might well said nothing yeah go rightfully Or, maybe point risk low enough, accept risk order see loved ones maintain mental health. absolutism unhelpful unrealistic. We're never going completely stop spread there's vaccine. hope decrease significantly taking sensible measures. would say avoid gatherings days test negative, that's sensible realistic way mitigate risk. said dad needs people. think respect decision care family also taking precautionary measures.

That said, still new drug, long term affects studied still baby want anything bad happen to.

It's light decision all. took months talking specialists, parents, different doctors within trial make decision. 

It's one thing know medicinal clinical trial relatively safe child, another actually enroll trial.

Oh wait per 100k people . population 21 million.

Edit: added second half. people arent allowed congregate. Whats point masks?

The point people still congregate: don‚Äôt want lock stay inside 

So want lock down. Indeed, I‚Äôll able rest easy knowing it‚Äôs beginning end  fucking sucks, I‚Äôm staying thanksgiving college go home winter break.

I don‚Äôt anywhere go entire side country fly home December. 

If flights dead would okay, seems everyday till January truly busy travel days.

I‚Äôve able get much serious PPE trip, there‚Äôs still much risk.

If don‚Äôt fly, please not. That's far certain. Look South Australia - outbreak quickly cleaned up. NZ, multiple outbreaks, rapidly eliminated contact tracing. hire people. bring every possible expert read quickly possible. months, knew they'd need this, prepare get done days? possible way faster?  Yeah virus spread effectively without masks. course , still go hang friends enjoy going twin peaks . There‚Äôs one opening near February üòÅüòé

Although honestly it‚Äôs usually one two friends table 10 waitress wearing mask anyways . possible contact trace without rumors flying. two new cases rumors flying chinese web even government announcement. hope so, certainly isn‚Äôt reflected anywhere else country.

Fuck off, people many us care dying foolish selfish behavior. yes, COVID spread animals humans via eating infected wild animals. well established fact.

Can source claim? I've heard zoo animals bring infected, also mink farms. eating wild animals miss part said slaughter animals right next it‚Äôs served? important part, numb-nuts

I hope younger generations show better whatever is. hope pray people wake thier delusions soon... Sure. Opinions opinions. Facts facts. confuse two. take masks we‚Äôre eating restaurant, includes indoor outdoor dining. mask wearing one part solution - gather groups 5, tables least meter apart. we‚Äôre done eating, mask goes back on.

At home, masks worn. 5 guests time, that‚Äôs pretty much really. thing makes work, fact ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù - enforced. Obviously can‚Äôt checking everyone‚Äôs homes, like Australia New Zealand, neighbours complained, they‚Äôll send someone check, pronto. 

All say things perfect - people still shit, safe distancing officers abuse power, taken care rather quickly. 

One thing absolutely crucial success measure, consistency - consistent messaging, consistent implementation, consistent enforcement. Perhaps it‚Äôs Singapore small enough work. maybe US bigger countries, needs better governance, stronger tone top, stringent checks. 

Am enjoying it? course not. family outside country seen since February, business suffered back April May circuit breaker (effectively lockdown) happened, hoped would get better, did. believe one sustain lockdowns long time, every little light coming thru end tunnel helps - travel bubble HK (which unfortunately suspended due increasing number cases there), discussion another travel bubble HK, certain activities (group sports, night life) starting again.

(Sorry long answer question üòÖ) don‚Äôt look Asia then. Lots Countries well there. 
Being island isn‚Äôt squashed it. low population, hard borders everyone (including government stimulus money) right thing is. think (even though can't really speak Norway, know did) managed reduce cases spring low limited lockdowns bit easier track that? 

But cases started grow again, especially around capital region - again. think interview people said think people tired corona careful used be... Case point. Wow.  discussing Asia, there's simple reason this: Confucianism. 

It's collective well-being desiring become best possible person practicing virtue compassion others, versus individual well-being pursuit one's utility best possible answer everything.

The west built stolen prosperity, games insiders cheap talk means nothing. Asia acts, speaks. That's difference. entirely question character.

We need attitude adjustment. created culture nobody trusted right thing, paying price it. hope people's rights stay intact people start looking scapegoats. still spread it, infect family teachers. Surely keep track many friends died? I'm Missouri read ""Springfield"" thought ""bet missouri"" #Y K E assume medical staff, military civilian leaders get first. half actual effective doses person needs 2. essential workers probably better old people stopping spread effective targeting vulnerable demographics. Stopping spreaders stop people dying faster giving vaccine vulnerable lethality low, infectiousness high. would Korean SAT 3 Dec. Korean government supposed increase social distancing level trend continues week, increased level due SAT national exams. That's lie know telling.

Maybe don't, many people highlight year. Yes, I'm Europe, know. made winter too, fall again. second flu season Covid, know. 

My point can't compare current numbers directly. can't even compare numbers first winter yours. 

As said, great job, keep it. mean we're 2,000 deaths day growing COVID...

In normal year past decade, yeah we've averaged ~7,000 deaths per day literally every source, really another 2,000+? Another ~30% increase deaths every single day single virus?

Doesn't seem like big deal. Oh nevermind fact numbers still under-reported we're closer 350,000 U.S. deaths note 250,000 deaths. Vietnam communist name only, ironically freedom anyone currently stuck states lol

But ok, Thailand then? COVID19 ultimate delayed gratification experiment. whole debacle fueled people selfish pieces shit makes much less sad future probably tons friends meet in-person can't drive thus probably working remotely. ""unity"" ever since Qin shihuang united China back bronze Age...

This concept unity also heavily ingrained Korean Japanese people too, really painful see Korea divided.  I'm Maui. voluntary Covid screening event HDOH airport workers. amount travelers wearing masks despite many signs stating masks required law staggering. cases increasing since Maui loosened travel restrictions negative test within 72 hours travel. one true hospital handle surge mainland hospitals also filled capacity, expect much staffing help form contract workers. talks allowing student nurses (there's 2 cohorts 40 each, one first year, one second year) granted temporary abilities function ""nurses"". absolutely, batshit insane. actually interviewed bat seems I'm opening Parler link, this? probably reasonable assumption death see, 5-10 people long lasting health problems, months fatigue, loss smell, including permanent lung, heart, brain damage. rate doubling daily deaths significantly lower spring. going easy, hard claimed either. lawyer cousin four kids joined Gab talk hoax. üôÑ Y'all avoid TP crunch buying bidet attachment. would use lot less TP, cleaner end. low low price $35. ???????

We never ‚Äòfull blown, major lockdowns‚Äô here. 
You don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre taking about. Trump administration said pricing vaccine? No, island relevant. Canada's done everything listed able squash virus.

Being island everything, course. UK (mostly) island, squashed virus either. Ah yes, communist country. I'm sure implementing policies two communist nations democracy would work super smoothly. Especially democracy values individual states power central power. think earlier?! Exactly America built? Racism white supremacy, outlaws robnery? lot those. basic infrastructure distributes FLU vaccines could fine. doses vaccine need cooling, nothing special delivery distribution wise cooling military can't really help commercial sector either. Commercial sector simply lot equipment experience delivery, vaccination, distribution refrigeration. 

The military experts military, that's all. Unless talking army core engineers get experience domestic work nothing military really. cases military competitive commercial sector really take practice infrastructure good things like that. I'm Australia core concept Australia ""tolerance"". We're okay. We're small country though, guess right. 1918 pandemic roughly seventy years development germ theory. Stick em kick em da door. Everyone getting vaccine. think I'll ever forget quickly virus went oddity think would big deal flipping life upside down. 

In span 3 days, went ""I guess Iranians flew airport way Vancouver, whoops"" ""well current rates entire population province caught three times 2 months, hope die."" Hour hour, company sent home people traveled Europe, anybody traveled, schools shut down, everything. Essential Workers category people &amp; high chance viral spread? Surely somewhere priority listing general public, right? always tell somebody dumbass they‚Äôll try explain rest us dumbasses something works, 0 understanding it. 

Let‚Äôs wait version 3.7 vaccine, heard one going work bugs. way around least saves daughter condolences. coworkers ever considered going strike something like protest community? ignorance fixed, like weapons grade stupidity. Curious, checked sites sidebar?

I think Trump's influence alt-right vastly exaggerated Trump's influence covid vastly underrated. single-handedly turned conversation covid ""What measures need stop it?"" political assault personal liberty. 

It's another thing racist white families lapped + misinformation got everyone, Pence President Feb, certainly here. Basically this, free everyone. insurance insurance company picking bill. government picking bill.   Vietnam then? Literally right next China? lizard people want us think. ""I like idea lockdown, refuse things could prevent it"" much reasonable sentiment /s You‚Äôre muppet mate. exactly Trump administration done far?  Yeah, UPS deliver packages lot better that's something time military not. important resource delivery military, still something time like actual delivery service.

When comes logistics delivery going outperform commercial delivery service. less like elementary school kid could figure out, practice makes perfect, industries specific jobs better jobs anybody else. 

Delivering supplies via air drop useful here. 

I think reason use military SECURE shipment maybe allow feds first come first service advantage, really great logistics delivery distribution, neither things normally efficiently commercial service everyday. Or, least, saving blame deaths. underestimation starts get really bad positivity rate gets percent.

Why so? bunched testing lot right? hadn‚Äôt totally botched half-assed covid response nation, wouldn‚Äôt dealing potentially 2 years shit. 

The initial lockdowns supposed curb spread disease. Take economic hit, reduce viral spread reopen country.

We failed that, terribly. Masks encouraged reduce active spread. politicized failed that. fed govt dropped responsibility states handle themselves. national mandates anything, free-for-all different guidelines mandates differ state state.

Now there‚Äôs vaccine coming out, I‚Äôve gathered people life, one wants fucking take it. instead shortening pandemic, may well stretch 2 years vaccine rollout take time, educate public want take damn things first place. Soar towards? That's already topped. long weekly average 200k day, say might happen next week. Well, never said fully justified. Still, I'm evaluating I've managed contract covid, decide precautions ineffective *other people* it.

Does make sense?  Oh screw sensitive bot. Literally nothing said incivil. wholesale price? know TDaP wholesales like $12 see billed ~$300 quite often. Vietnam 100 million people 3 land borders including China. thing would really make difficult political/law side EU common border agreements could done. fact there's consensus asymptomatic people spread much spread it.

The best thing error side strict quarantine possible. staying room getting delivery something roommates put door pretty doable, shared bathroom little bit problematic.

If one bathroom maybe could like get use one bathroom would use would always wear mask outside room.

I would put small fan window blowing room generate negative pressure keep airflow blowing outward.

If central HVAC system cold air return heat vent think cover good Eric circulate room rest house.

If cooler climate might temporarily use electric heater make heat difference. Electric blankets also quite efficient options since I'm recommending turn central heat blow conditioned air room.

It's good situation people house everything live outside house temporarily live outside house temporarily know probably easy options.

If could like stay tent yard maybe shed something could temporarily quarantine to, would even safer roomies could pull least days estimate peak infection. 

Betting asymptomatic spread minimal without real consensus much bet never know one roommates might highly susceptible regardless perceived health. great work!

One thing blows away hard New England got hit spring. look cumulative deaths per 100k, NY get passed LA MS, budging much since June. NJ still way ahead. can't imagine like live through. What?
The first time incompetence.

The second time due incompetence ignorance. Deniers unable understand balance. watched tornado barely touch NY rest country either enjoying lovely weather football field back locker rooms bracing doorway preparing real storm. But, *freedom* things relative it, Chinese government job people expects to, make good, hell considered bad weeks beginning.

But became clear almost every government planet earth bar far, far worse, perceptions change.

After all, half million dead Europe US something civilized countries ignore, people planet still base reality observation rather doctrine. known going happen went Joe rogan podcast back March explained Rogan saunas cure COVID. foreshadowed rest country's approach next 9 months. walk away.

Nothing chains employer.

The nurses ton options, doctors absolutely choose accept additional patients, opt come work anymore. rights worker work unsafe environment. issue lack empathy. issue Westerners denial completely fail live supposed core values - particularly individualism.

Most people West actually deeply conformist. That's refuse wear masks see act patriotism. stupid lack empathy. desperate fit willing dumb conform. psychology drove idiots eating Tide Pods.

By contrast similar pretense _must_ individual East Asia. That's people refusing wear masks countries. pressure exerted assert ""individuality"", feel need swallow dangerous chemicals show off.

The sole exception Philippines - particularly liberal middle class laps American individualism talk. that's cohort pretty much verging delusionally suicidal Covid. Philippines actually thinks okay job given circumstances, hence president getting 80+% approval rate. 

But agreeing government would make ""conformist"", pretty much keep finding new things upset justify opposition government policy. time fly weekend work... Stupidest country planet!  737 also got sell someone another aircraft, paid insurance. Oh ... I‚Äôm board w/ 100%, way I‚Äôm jumping line one far testing done **There finally light end Covid tunnel. Two promising vaccines ‚Äì one developed Turkish immigrants Germany, US firm co-founded Canadian scientist Lebanese born investor ‚Äì ought enable Europeans put pandemic behind us point next year.**

But now, Europe seems set long, dark Covid winter, situation Brussels particularly grim. coronavirus cases surged again, authorities reimposed stringent restrictions residents businesses. societies locked again, economy going back reverse. disaster ordinary Europeans, also Europe‚Äôs global standing.

For sure, places Europe coping pandemic better others. Economically, manufacturing powerhouses Sweden Germany experienced less severe slumps far tourist destinations Spain Italy. Healthwise, Helsinki far fewer coronavirus cases deaths per million residents Brussels, rivals Madrid European capital worst-hit Covid-19 far.

Shockingly, mid-November total number Covid deaths per million people Belgium eight times higher neighbouring Germany. differences measured death rates across countries may due discrepancies Covid deaths counted, comparisons number deaths year excess average previous five years confirm worst-affected European countries UK, Spain Belgium.

It may comfort Europeans even incompetent European governments seem like models public-health management compared reckless ineptitude Trump administration US. bigger international picture far less flattering. Europeans like think societies epitome global sophistication progress, governments economies dealing pandemic much worse China East Asia are.

Indeed, scarcely decade 2008‚Äì09 financial meltdown ensuing crisis eurozone shredded Europe‚Äôs reputation sound economic management speeded relative economic decline, coronavirus pandemic destroying reputation good governance accelerating economic decline.

The catalogue failures long. European governments unduly complacent Covid beginning year. failed prevent virus‚Äôs spread Europe, forced economically devastating lockdowns prevent hospitals overwhelmed. Confinements eased virus fully suppressed.

Worse, summer months infections low, governments failed develop effective mass testing contact tracing systems would prevented resurgence cases. Now, face second wave threatens overwhelm healthcare systems, governments imposing painful new social economic restrictions every week.

The contrast East Asia instructive. China slow react initial spread disease imposed particularly severe lockdown, especially Wuhan, since kept virus suppressed, quickly stamping subsequent local flare-ups. South Korea quelled initial upsurge cases without economy-wide lockdown ruthlessly effective contract tracing selective isolation. Taiwan also avoided lockdown; officials monitoring arrivals Wuhan even Chinese government admitted problem. Korea Taiwan made good use mobile-phone technology suppress virus. Even Vietnam, poor country long porous border China, managed keep lid Covid.

The difference mortality figures vast. mid-November Europe recorded 330,000 deaths Covid ‚Äì including 13,000 Germany, seen success European standards. contrast, China counted 4,634 deaths, Japan 1,903, Korea 496, Vietnam 35 Taiwan 7.

For sure, East Asia recent experience dealing coronavirus pandemic, suffered SARS 2002‚Äì04. nothing stop European governments learning lessons SARS too. perhaps excusable overwhelmed initial exponential spread Covid-19 Europe February March, inexcusable haven‚Äôt used time since develop suppression measures effective East Asia‚Äôs. paraphrase Oscar Wilde, forced lock economy may regarded misfortune; twice looks like carelessness. much supposed superiority European governance.

The incompetence European governments led painful restrictions personal freedom along many avoidable deaths. also hammering European economies.

**The pandemic leave scars**

The gap West East glaring. even Germany facing worst recession since 1930s, China major economy world likely grow year. Output per person plunged France scarcely fallen South Korea. governments eurozone, UK US running huge debts try cushion blow Covid collapse, Taiwan‚Äôs scarcely needs borrow all. huge divide economic performance set grow second wave sweeping Europe autumn winter takes toll.

Worse, European economies likely take years make lost ground. economic activity bounce back next year vaccine forthcoming semblance normal life resumes, pandemic inevitably leave scars ‚Äì least young people‚Äôs education job prospects.

The structural shifts pandemic accelerated ‚Äì notably increased adoption digital technologies ‚Äì accentuate economic disruption. likes Zoom video conferencing online shopping boon, near term digital transition may cost jobs airlines shrink physical stores shutter faster new jobs created.

When pandemic finally passes, many workers outdated skills, either languished unemployed governments subsidised remain jobs longer viable. Many businesses lumbered huge debts may bearable interest rates remain low prevent investing become productive. governments high debts may greater latitude continue borrowing, especially central banks continue snap bonds, eventually face pressure, domestically EU level, tighten belts.

The upshot Europeans face long period economic misery. Europe‚Äôs weight world plunge ‚Äì again. Consider financial crisis struck 2008, eurozone‚Äôs economy three times bigger China‚Äôs euro terms. decade later, China overtaken it. year, China set surpass EU whole.

Relative economic decline wider repercussions. EU geopolitical pygmy. lacks cohesive foreign policy, let alone military might. power defend Europeans‚Äô interests within Europe elsewhere depends largely economic clout.

It EU huge single market ‚Äì worth ‚Ç¨16.4 trillion 2019 ‚Äì takes collective decisions trade, regulation competition policy stand President Donald Trump‚Äôs bullying trade, develop tough rules protect environment data privacy emulated globally, curb monopolistic excesses big tech companies. Thus, EU single market‚Äôs global importance diminishes, EU‚Äôs scope shape world.

As well eroding Europe‚Äôs economic heft, coronavirus crisis undermining cultural appeal. German cars appliances associated high quality, Italian fashion luxury, French food wine good taste. broadly, European societies seem offer enviable combination freedom, security quality life. also associated unenviable mix shambolic governance draconian lockdowns, creaking public healthcare systems, individual irresponsibility unnecessary deaths. tarnishes European brand internationally sorts ways.

Last least, Europe‚Äôs failure get grips Covid pandemic casts aspersions political system. liberal democracy intrinsic appeal many people ‚Äì offers individuals greater freedom citizens collectively greater power ‚Äì also popular associated economic success good government.

Liberal democracy already taken battering financial crisis, made governments seem incompetent corrupt. Now, European governments can‚Äôt even manage basics keeping people safe.

For sure, South Korea Taiwan, boisterous democracies, successfully suppressed virus. yes, pandemic exposed bungling illiberal populists Trump. may also bolster global appeal effective authoritarian governance. Another reason Beijing may benefit Covid failings Brussels Berlin ‚Äì mention London Washington DC. people really don‚Äôt get it. MORONS. teacher, thank responsible thing. We're still in-person, despite skyrocketing cases test positivity 8%, shit scary. west, Europe US that've fucked bigtime. us work every day, deal morons like you.  *plenty* people, including me, missing family gatherings care other. go ahead, spread rest anti-science relatives. rest us sacrificing really appreciate 5th grade mentality. Closer 2k day important matter bad gets, instead blaming poor people stupid/irresponsible/fat/lazy/etc, blame people charge decades refused stewards country's well-being.

YES. Take awards! I've saying thing WEEKS NOW. Religion used justify crazy shit nothing religion.

""If America needs socialised healthcare Jesus would come tell us so.""
""Climate change? God gave us planet live on, arrogant us think could control climate Him."" Good border control? trials start adults. takes time. Oh expect lot this. new normal crew already trying undermine vaccines. Vaccinate shit vulnerable people soon possible, imagine.

Since restrictions eased gradually going fully back was, take longer grow back levels lockdown, maybe 3 months. vaccinate significant portion vulnerable then, less severe restrictions might needed. Yes... Thanksgiving Christmas coming up, US truly fucked. state Department Health webinar prioritized order. mocking forgetting put question Mark 

Nonetheless, I‚Äôm one asking questions here!

Hope u get penguin soon tho lowkey kinda want soft toy well I‚Äôm really happy you! That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm still person it‚Äôs really scary. hope go remote soon. :( pandemic soured teaching. wonder 9/11 every day wake people up. Unfortunately doubt it. live? want never go accident. hospital *might* ok, hospitals many parts country not.  That's literally sister said me: go outside get all.

She got April still gotten smell taste back. 

I know one us stupid one anymore, I'll stick gut tells stay locked in. Hopefully automation fix one day. life getting burnt again. Everytime something going way, think, ""I know this. Lets see turns out."" can't accept good things happen you. one people asymptomatic, turns 7 people spreading. I‚Äôm surprised stubborn ‚Äúmuh freedum‚Äù people, I‚Äôm also not. People fucking idiots. people splash water hands consider ‚Äúwashed‚Äù Sooooo.... US really 3rd world country? guarantee military strategists China watching glee chaotic, uncoordinated, inept US response been. Along easily US society manipulated divided conspiracy theories ideological propaganda they're probably designing perfect playback slamming invasion conquer. Turns West society narcissistic whiners, living society fight survival countrymen win individuals, casualties damned. East hand society focuses teamwork empathy win team.

2020 really disillusioned Western world. hate part it. Yep. $1.99/lb. area. Spent somewhat vibe this. could social norms may dictate pessimism inherently bad, reality functions basic survival mechanism some. new normal idiots never give seems decent person I‚Äôm pretty lucky remote learning actually going REALLY well parents class 24 happy enough elected stay remote. returned nearly decade teaching internationally, access lot technology public schools, kind prepared. Hoping continues go well! otherwise ""socialist"" hence ""communist"".

I really idea working class folks live paycheck care try something different. Socialism capitalism (no, terms exclusive) aim promote equality fairer system all, one hint ""s"" words folks go fit without good reason. see posting pictures friends, drinking, playing beer games shit? clueless fuck

Pretty easy things, right? previous comment tho. Reddit general. funny Redditors think preferred platform negative influence society.  patients mild moderate symptoms. Monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab imdevimab, may associated worse clinical outcomes administered hospitalized patients COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen mechanical ventilation.

I wonder much treatment costs it‚Äôs going offered older, wealthy individuals afford keep chance severe disease minimum. China blocking investigation Fort Detrik, in-fact China called one, US responded leaving WHO. That's storage temperature. actually injected temperature. Pfizer vaccine refrigerated like normal shot 5 days. would extremely unsafe inject something -70 degrees probably get downvoted people scolding irresponsible. Australia virus living memory, Spanish flu even really long time ago, what's excuse.. Isolation? I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going this. Floridian, also considered riding Colorado state‚Äôs early success.

Florida zero restrictions businesses months now. that, restrictions fairly light. big cities local mask ordinances, probably one reasons aren‚Äôt North Dakota. Still, virus growing. 

Some context. 

Floridians learned live situation far ideal. state income tax. completely dependent property tax (which capped 3% raise year home owners) sales taxes (our bread butter). Tourism life blood, pressure ‚Äúact normal‚Äù tremendous. think still people waiting unemployment support. 

Here tell you... actively protect people. Buy self-protective masks lots hand sanitizer soap. Give people sidewalk lot space. 

Also, Try let people‚Äôs irresponsible behavior stress much much stress deplete mental health resources need stay focused. Example. grocery shop week wipe packages. Everyone thinks we‚Äôre crazy, don‚Äôt care. takes half hour week wipe, fact is, virus common now, we‚Äôd rather relaxed around items bring home even slightly worried. 

Why? even little worry, time, hurts discipline resolve. ton pressure ‚Äúact normal.‚Äù Friends family getting together enclosed spaces, coworkers pulling masks talk... takes mental strength kindly tell loved ones can‚Äôt come over, diplomatically ask coworker please speak us masked. 

Believe me.. little things chip away resolve. Florida, design. governor adopted idea pursue ‚Äúnatural herd immunity.‚Äù least Colorado doesn‚Äôt that... think gov care, doesn‚Äôt federal money shut down. 

So, once.. I‚Äôm telling act like Floridian! Haha  vaccine must safe long term. Given technology used (RNA) new, two months test small sample size isn‚Äôt really enough stop skepticism many.

Also, French gov done piss poor communication job last 9 months doesnt help improve public trust bio-pharmacological companies / gov policies.   Valuing individualism collectivism. doubt meant, add point Chinese New Year spread coronavirus outside Wuhan. 5 million people entered exited city Chinese New Year, got virus spread larger level see Trump increased testing he's lost Expect bunch sensationalist articles hundreds people dying day got vaccine. happened Korea elderly first group vaccinated flu year. smart, lots people jamming medical system got virus bar. Someone pays everywhere. unusual patient pay pocket flu shot even US. mean shot us FREE. Someone manufactured vaccine specialized labor expensive facility. yeah, pay flu shot someone else pays you. exist.

Someone last name Li exist, 10 minute police visit, went back work next day treat patients caught COVID week later. got arrested would still alive. Yes? sister due end January. Luckily husband take virus seriously. antibodies imprinting left body done illness, t-cells also play role remembering effective defensive strategies, last years, even life sometimes. Gov: ‚ÄúWear people months later: ‚ÄúLockdowns masks don‚Äôt work!‚Äù Look, I'm gonna bite. I'm NEUTRAL GODDAMMIT! article SARS COV-2 might Italy already September 2019. even invaded Chad 

[Invading Melbourne pulling similar daily cases France UK. pretty clear opportunity virus could contained, initiative try.     curve, stops exponential damage done... people clinical trials. Especially disease condition, fully encourage people them. make great advances benefit society whole.

Quite often people's first choice instead last resort understand that, nothing lose point. actually treatment suitable, people earlier appropriate.

I rejected clinical trial offer regret it.

I hope child well clinical trial proposed first place chances will. UK US certainly run technocrats

Germany, neither. They're bad absolute showers running US/UK, they're cut unqualified, incompetent cloth. Partisan politics toxic. Bout time America emulated Europe tried representative democracy. carry danger letting racists whackos govt happen get enough votes, like happened already US though. mean look squatting White House now. 9.4% patients received placebo didn‚Äôt contract COVID

That's really deceptive way looking it: Suppose COVID continues spreading six months current rate (200,000 infections per day) vaccine works rate. June 99.96% vaccinated people contracted COVID, 10% non-vaccinated people infected. delta grows time. make harder social distance ü§∑ actually reason almost everyone thinks they‚Äôre better looking/smarter/more financially well-off actually are. It‚Äôs useful evolutionary mechanism (more optimism = confidence/positive outlook life leads higher reproduction/being productive) Thanks, spreader  health insurance companies know this. Look find way weaseling coverage later preexisting Covid. hillbilly red staters suddenly find public option good option. pay bill comes due - escaping it.  weird island helps tiny bit yet COVID free locations share one thing

Tonga sincerely doubt death rate hold hospitals fill run nurses/doctors/equipment. happens everywhere also able siphon parts country.

Basically worry deeply US Hong Kong I‚Äôm pretty sure state first responders group (or group immediately after) healthcare workers. take uninhabitable uninhabited areas Australia actually relatively high density American standards.

I think people quickly write here, mean never mind state borders, city locked down. Along regions, back last case virus community April. took strong measures popular opinion want pandemic. Response/support keeping sky high.

Been pretty disappointed West comparison, one else even seemed interested trying. Multiple Asian countries decided take won, western countries too. really ""just island thing"", actually try something succeed it? sooner realise human disease regard human constructs labels lines drawn maps, faster cured disease clearly suffering from, cure for.  lot cases tons California bad elsewhere people symptoms and/or suspecting recent exposure want test get case numbers high enough bring restrictions onto county.  Y'all* likely 100k+ dead.

That's impossibly low. US already 2000 deaths dead weekdays, consequences current wave played yet.

My best estimate 200,000 deaths March, hospital system collapses... lot more. Kind equivalent Caligula naming horse senator?

Although I‚Äôd probably trust horse... gold bars? address pics number useful info.... on. thanx advance. I'll preface saying absolutely right, shit unacceptable.

But think reason there's desire keep kids school schools/teachers *not* prepared transition online. senior high school last year college freshman year hope gives grounds speak it.

Learning online difficult, exhausting, confusing every party involved (including parents, im guessing). sucks. Teachers primarily teach person classes equipped make sudden transition online, rightfully fundamentally different. taxing students find difficult focus computer screen hours.

But yeah fuck anyone wanting kids go back Yep. adults. family members, consider somewhat estranged now, espoused anti-mask sentiments allowed kids go in-person school play football go church...it's honestly repulsive even realize much they're contributing spread. Even kids directly get sick now...like mentioned, well could see complications spring later. see 30% wearing mask mandatory, country like US, feel lucky bro. 77% is, area meat is. Good shit dont live U.S go one lockdown im gonna need therapy. 
Atleast hope early 2021 obsession Sweden subreddit pathelogical. criticism countries like Belgium Czech Republic almost amount deaths per capita last two months Sweden entirety first wave? almost criticism Czech strategy put almost eggs ""masks silver bullet basket"". November Czechia second deadliest month EU country since pandemic started.

The statements health authorities Sweden made projections immunity baseless statements CDC, IHME everyone wore masks pandemic would over. observably false countries like France, Italy, Spain, Belgium 95%+ mask compliance. almost criticism level magical thinking thinking Sweden herd immunity.  Australia, culturally western country, followed mass quarentine movement limitations worked true. lot anti vax anti mask stance held parents. Goofy unfortunate. Poland capped 24k cases almost 50 percent positive rate, real numbers way higher lockdown. I've gotten point I'd gleefully cheer medical workers going strike pandemic since like July August. definition ""clear"". evidence? Yep. findings conclusive wider h2h?. debatable Got love it. I've invited ten events Springfield area, one planning sort precaution covid-19. Even better people panic buying stuff again, still refusing wear masks. wear fucking mask, need hoard toilet paper. Lock down. Stay home. Government pays businesses also pay workers. 

The government doubled unemployment payments made sure everyone taken care financially best could. 

Stepped staffing hospitals. Increased authorised overtime recommissioned old ventilators/equipment. 

Total travel bans remote indigenous community. Police army locking roads hot spots. 

14 day quarantine performed travel interstate. 

Criminal prosecutions observing quarantine organising mask less protests. 

Contact tracing outbreaks round clock dedicated highly supported virology teams. 

And all. Huge community cooperation. Everyone dug bit. 

And start taking masks getting back thanks hard work. 

And break again.... 

We get straight back locking down. 

Like adults.


Criminal prosecutions violated Americans spoiled, deluded dumbasses. never learn. Till last minute learn. ever considered these? century pandemic, they've already made vaccine it. needs mass produced, enough population inoculated. really care this?

I get one life live I‚Äôm young, can‚Äôt see staying house others still enjoying lives families. 

Not mention, I‚Äôve working throughout whole pandemic. work job I‚Äôm exposed lot people anyway. that, I‚Äôm DEFINITELY going see family. 

Ideally, I‚Äôd want one die course. it‚Äôs virus. Unfortunately people die there‚Äôs nothing it. people pre-existing conditions elderly take precautions. someone age/health bracket doesn‚Äôt put much risk dying, I‚Äôm putting life pause. makes selfish, it.   dear god say isnt still travel within country, states shut state borders. Unlike americans, Trump actually deals foreigners. exposed come understand one takes seriously. knows election shat world leaders. must see looks attitudes towards him. decided use places. paper month old, things shifting pretty quickly vaccine front. [The Pfizer trial start including children last hopefully trials upcoming vaccines well Hopefully 2021 find way unite everyone.

The psychopaths meet rest us least halfway though - admitting actual President is

I see happening. see sane majority willing agree looney minority President. Yo, look happened cases Canada post thanksgiving. Yall treat. Huh?  Without lockdown stays exponential, Germany exponential lockdown, still slowly increasing.  wash cooking though - process spreads salmonella kitchen also spread corona too. reproductive number around r2 places, gathering could potentially infect 100s people short timeframe single carrier proper isolation. madness even consider getting together anyone outside household perfect example spreading like wildfire there. Weird article That's reality. There's way enforce mandate without significantly restricting air travel first. How's Target been? since early March. :( Millions... Ah, hopefully, one spent millions study find out... freebie... Entitled fucks whatever want - entitled - duh? study needed. since internet say agree selfish ""ENTITLED"" haha. people problems following guidelines like box whatever reads open end opposite contents spill floor Stopping people traveling would nearly impossible country  going last thanksgiving bunch people... disagree. pandemic, peor know would travel visit families time, especially Thanksgiving Christmas, I'd families together Facebook.

And plenty gym rats people going gym several times week. worked fitness center may biased there, several friends lifted weights took classes.

People vocal part lives, like eating sleeping.  Yeah, ever get funds sewing ability I'd love start making/customizing fashion masks like one huge flower something side one them, stuff like that's specifically made go understated, fashionable/stylish jacket, suit, hat, dress. Right pattern masks loud really go anything nice stylish. 

Especially someone who's disabled prone immune flare-ups every little thing myself, I'd also really much rather catch spread anything causes sickness disability, either. also see TSA travel numbers look extremely high (yet): mean... premise yet contracted covid, either precautions, luck, both.

Would like conversation lol? be, right? even question people would need pay vaccinated? quick google search ‚Äúcovid death rate US‚Äù shows 2.2%, per [johns not. UK fox news people act almost equally retarded. safer 10 people.

Is safe ? No. Tortankum pointless, let's waste time.

They call us ""seasonality deniers"" (which wrong first place) even understand Corona spreads stronger **one** winter proof ""strong seasonality"". time studies show Corona relatively weak seasonality (compared flu) care studies. Masks normalized future go sick anything, honestly possibly Donald Trump Jr. I'm speaking purely US here, though countries relate. economy structured people's economic freedom limited. range activities people afford small. people get take yearly vacations. get travel. get buy expensive toys. houses heated pools tennis courts gyms. real enjoyment people get going bar eating weekends. go see movie sit friends. sit home watch TV. that's it. people asked stop things, what's left? text friends, maybe skype. sit home watch TV. lot people even yards go anything outside. yards small, sit outside. way two generations now. post war boom ended wealth snatched up, we're left with. people simply know anything else. 

Covid really rubbed noses ways we've wrong. future relies telling overworked, underpaid, demoralized people sit beige box stare wall months. Oh, even going get help it. 

I'm trying make excuses irresponsible people. shit together this, we'd fine. people saying along ignored called nasty things anyone charge. important matter bad gets, instead blaming poor people stupid/irresponsible/fat/lazy/etc, blame people charge decades refused stewards country's well-being. 

That said, yes bad traveling right nobody it. think next ""real"" summer? 2022? 23?! 24?!?! individual states, already overwhelmed unable effectively manage worse humanitarian crisis country experienced 100 years--not mention levels state local governments fiscal insolvency--are going expeditiously distribute tens millions vaccines year.

I hope God happens success nearly unfathomable. date we've performed 180,000,000 tests nationwide execution  underwhelming. past nine months highlighted anything, government's astounding inadequacies. Buckle Reddit peeps keep love, safe can. People complaining lockdowns people follow rules.

Change mind parent parent let say thst anti maskers must kids. Parents know germy kids many sicknesses get easily spread schools daycare. government wants experiment opening daycare schools seeing happens superspreading going everything basically point return many kids going suffer. neck woods, elderly old folks homes 1a priority medical personnel 1b priority.

You're going lot impact vaccinating residents old folks home vaccinating dozen doctors nurses 30s. mean, that's assuming family live alone tiny apartment horribly depressed. Bill Gates one person might convince get vaccine sooner later.  I'm pretty sure coercion would thrown even found way court law (here England, anyway). FAMILY CANCELLED HAWAII CHRISTMAS SURGE

I've adding new features week thanks user feedback, appreciate thoughtful insights. really care load foreigners unhappy Swedes wearing masks.

Neither usual Swedish comparisons, Norway, Denmark Finland, used masks stop first wave.

Many countries EU mask rules stopped second wave.

While masks may work theoretical possibly individual level. seem prevent second waves. rate, cases may outpace capacity test, capacity hospitalize treat, capacity bury cremate. I'm going bet numbers, I'm sure usual metrics January dwarf now. Uh...I actually like wearing mask sometimes, mostly store know mask stops spraying spit everywhere every time talk. also mouth lyrics songs like without anyone suspecting thing I'm wearing mask. Part wants vaccine right away part like, ""Yo, Thalidomide"". think misunderstood post. Target definitely free insurance, give gift cards get without insurance. paid $20/PP get Costco since insurance alarmed might missed getting actual free, haha. think would wise anyone research, done honest way rather pandering conspiracy theory influences.

There doubt getting vaccine time frame remarkable achievement considering development vaccines, considered. also think natural hold degree healthy skepticism given generally learn experience, whereas experience say flu jab know risk we're taking, experience vaccine. undoubtedly risk associated vaccine vaccines.

On hand, damage virus England around world immeasurable.

According Washington Post 100 children included Pfizer/BioNTech trials start finish, aged 12-15 years old. imagine catch attention parent. Someone said ""There decades nothing happens; weeks decades happen.""

It go immediate, short term history largest mass casualty event US history, Christmas happens month later goes truly largest mass casualty event. New Zealand Australia done well, discussion. exactly comparable though, one big difference season, another climate, third travel, work leisure. second season yet, hopefully vaccination. spread second season much worse first. 

Hopefully, years now, thorough analysis teach us exactly deciding factors controlling spread. problem lot tougher lot people seem thinking. California we're seeing 5% positivity rate. 95% negative. Presumably could see lot positives run testing capacity.   Ur momma :-0   precautions

Philly Redditor tutored college here. last day campus Friday 13th March semi-normal spring break week week before.

Glad no-one know badly affected virus still scared thing. thinking going get Italy-style lockdown never happened. I'll probably never think Friday 13th way again. really felt apocalyptic announcements days leading it. deaths. long term result lung, heart, brain damage potentially scary af well. Exponential growth can't continue forever. There'll limiting factors actual number people infected per day based population distribution behaviours etc., even without control measures taken.

At point numbers plateau. sure number though. Iirc government make recommendations (which last step take taking free away citizens) strong evidence support it.

I‚Äôm actually starting think argument ‚ÄúAmerican individualism causing this‚Äù another example American exceptionalism: want believe we‚Äôre different best, even catching virus dying. data show that‚Äôs so.

Most places avoided fate done imposing mandatory lockdowns. Happy provide CA/LA breakdown (I love data) although obviously meant comparatively speaking. Feel free browse referenced sources.

- % positive rate really relevant metric comparison places since testing longer metropolitan region. first major city offer free COVID tests residents still massive drive areas (e.g. Dodger Stadium) running every day. Testing new hard come by, neither overall COVID situation. experiencing ‚Äúpanic testing‚Äù rampant saturated states. numbers diluted unnecessary testing fearful healthy folks. People get tested nowadays definitely likely ill, doesn‚Äôt mean disproportionate number COVID cases.
- California - LA County far infected region - #23 testing volume (lots testing) #42 cases (low relative infection). ranks per capita (Worldometer). Keeping mind, course highest number overall cases... people. Per capita ranking system matters comparative purposes. 
- R0 going down, currently 1.10 peak 1.17 month ago (daily Citizen update). don‚Äôt actually understand decline speculate. It‚Äôs good thing.


Here full LA county data file, really fascinating:
http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf
Lots see here. highlights: 

- approx 50% hospital beds remaining

- hospitalized patients 73% latinx, gives improved timeline running worst cases equally spread demographically

- 30+ days PPE adjusting COVID utilization rates


The situation great yes get worse, would say still least fucked pretty much major US city. 20 million doses still administered. going change everything getting day two early really matter. places probably still even ready store vaccine site yet.

Imagine wrote thread, huge problem first months, vaccines scarce. that, many change opinion. lot coping current situation might opinions well: say get immediately, admit situation bad enough warrant getting vaccine months data. refrigerated morgues to....store ice cream  Shit...now mention it...that‚Äôs crazy man...fuck US

Alteratively Google ""Attila Hildmann"" 
He Vegan Cook hes one biggest conspiracy theorist germany Plus estimates talking made without mitigation efforts place. That's would happen little nothing. Cap. Lmfao.  pay higher taxes then. Maybe it‚Äôs passed Brazil‚Äôs many places Founding Fathers would despise modern, selfish, idiotic, two party version America Ugh, fucking white people. Flu viruses hard. Coronaviruses easy. need mask lockdown they‚Äôre done. yet despite higher technology easier pandemic see lot deaths. Competence short supply now. ALLOWED stupid? Back March nobody knew vaccine coronavirus even possible. must stupid!

If mitigation measure vaccine think would happened that's reality number like generated from, speculation might happen start taking seriously.

We mitigation efforts failed consider impact? DERP No, think Swedes healthier others. best think public health slightly average bigger cities, north i've moved obesity, poor diet questionable alcohol consumption high. 

Though, I'm basing i've observed chances i'm full poop. clever! refuse believe spent 45 dollars buying one last birds local market....damnit. problem highly individualistic nature Western Society, terms YOLO, Carpe Diem FOMO pretty much dominated last 30 years.

This provides ideal playing field Virus statistically affect individuals hard tackles collective resource healthcare system. Translation: need covid! make bold claim saying done testing validation vaccine. 

That's true all. 

Tell bit skipped? Ya fauci estimating approx 200,000  ""CDC"" 3 step appoach called them:

Yeah, good Taiwan, Australian, New Zealand, three countries OP listed, islands. Thinking more, think double proportionality model would probably ‚Äúfair‚Äù.

Like county went 60 votes R 40 votes B (Total people county = 100). weight covid cases amount. 10 people got covid, 6 cases go red portion 4 blue.

My reasoning behind conceptually control land artifacts eg‚Äîstate/county lines politics covid. lot bathtub shaped frequency population distributions. I‚Äôm happy used per capita data.

I‚Äôve heard Americans paying $400 $1000 per month. 15 years ago friends (teacher) paid $1400 per month health insurance family three. Plus Americans pay deductibles go doctor! Plus overall plan deductible!

No, think we‚Äôre much better financially US. Even tax rate may may higher.

Somebody please help. physically locking doors letting in-person classes, locking online classes, nothing help. Yes, preclinical trials obviously incomplete data. It‚Äôs still datapoint data points regarding Oxford vaccine. I‚Äôm camp really caring antibody titers ect. actual immune response vaccine triggers far complicated simply making antibodies. vaccine could make tons antibodies fail spectacularly make many work great. Ultimately vaccine (and should) judged ability prevent transmission, prevent severe disease, it‚Äôs safety profile. data right showing three criteria Biontech great. preliminary data suggesting Moderna. exactly zero data three Oxford. Maybe comes Oxford best bunch. 11-22-2020 say prefer Oxford vaccine seems much like fanfare science. It‚Äôs ‚Äúlumped parameter‚Äù model, say physics. We‚Äôre mostly seeing spikes Midwest though. notion handling once-in-a-100-years pandemic bearing capability nation ensure good life citizens remaining 99 years ridiculous.

This something continually pissed anti-Western narratives peddled online.

The vast majority time, pandemic. Western countries provide hugely superior standard living countries sub drools over, single biggest reason individual rights sub blames poor coronavirus response. There's reason many people emigrate non-Western countries Western ones, opposite.

Most people would much rather endure hardship short time order freedom whole lives; relatively safe one year make life oppression. everyone throughout history thought way people sub do, Western Europeans would never bothered fighting WW2: they'd said stupid risk life war ""freedumb"".

I thank God generation largely around more: they'd sickened see great-grandchildren mock idea preferring lifetime freedom one year slightly higher safety.

And ""one year slightly higher safety"" right. China's appalling disregard environment means long-term, citizens far likely die avoidable respiratory problems Westerners are, despite problems virus. 20-49 good chunk US population. 50-69 block .005/99.5% according document.(I would link think people look parent comment click) 

I‚Äôm downplaying it, I‚Äôm giving people actual data. Yes you‚Äôre 70+ 94.6% rate, might want take extra precautions. time, old, I‚Äôd probably willing accept risk chance death non-covid event higher, giving life year don‚Äôt much time left would really hard do. People hopeless , I‚Äôm surprised survived entitlement stupidity long economy collapse. Right, say nobody talking nonsense. lot lawmakers pushing it, many others don‚Äôt give shit enough American people anything Iheanacho i‚Äôm okay love logic. 

If aren‚Äôt risk, go visit people care risk!

I hope going enjoy large indoor gatherings friends family holiday season. taste humanity look like dealing environmental crisis. Selfishness beyond reason. criticize Elon Musk getting earth humanity can't trusted right thing lives depend it. Yeah...it's impossible, stars would REALLY align perfectly happen timeline. 

I think instead talking best possible scenario, would really well manage people's expectations point. That's consistent problem throughout whole mess every single time results people frustrated, angry rebellious would otherwise. 

They tell us November, happens August September (a much realistic timeline) everyone moon. sample size 44,000 people - 22,000 got vaccine 22,000 got placebo.

During course trial, 160 participants became infected Covid. 152 placebo group 8 vaccine group.

Therefore vaccine prevented 95% infections statistically would normally happened vaccine group time period. live small ranching town, around family daily line work. usually family travel surrounding towns dont see daily thanksgiving cancled EVERYTHING. live 30 minutes hour away nothing considering live. 1 million total we‚Äôre lucky. We‚Äôll probably 200k month January more. cherry picking results. million people traveled airports single day. RIP many tests think we're right now? isn‚Äôt kill thy neighbor one ten commandments? don‚Äôt kill anyone... i‚Äôm starting think american christians read actual bible instead prosperity gospel pamphlets hand for-profit corporate church. feel like everyone saying this, almost one considering ‚Äúthat side‚Äù already contracted virus May, least enough point natural immunity vaccine immunity effectively ends pandemic USA. Especially rate infections going right now, amount travel holidays yet underway. Ontario added 1588 Sat (our record). shy 4x population alberta. Stay safe there, friends Canada also tests lower rate US. NY routinely 4 times many tests Ontario per day. Cant wait go fucking party. Hope right   Great response, deserves upvotes.


And mainly formaldehyde. yes believe also used ton things. Definitely smart statistically younger people never admitted ICU bed. people still lack sense empathy communities. I‚Äôve taken ignoring posts. They‚Äôre people think broken bone bankrupt literally American, without insurance. looking graphs interpreting things correctly? Also, remember things occur least weeks later mainland.

[HDOH Wow, thanks sharing. parents decided cancel trip Kauai days ago. really worried idiots masks holiday surges. Thank god aren‚Äôt going. thanksgiving I‚Äôm inviting grandpa, hasn‚Äôt contact anyone cause got coronavirus he‚Äôs scared it, moms boyfriend, mom, :) That's bit simplistic. would suggest anyone watch Century Self. goes back post WW1 atomizing population keep organizing propaganda used divert people's emotions one another onto consumer products. really took effect post WW2 depression slowed down. means intimating stupid people would carry lives simply isn‚Äôt case. Florida open enjoying itself, goes many others states hundreds millions people. sooner minority realizes sooner goes away something new afraid of. like 20k people placebo group 20k people received actual vaccine, waited like 3 months. placebo group like 170 people got COVID vaccine group like 6 got COVID. mean say protect wearer, also protect others, protection others probably even greater protection wearer. dear friend's older sister nurse TN. told early (like, April) could volunteer go COVID ward adequately trained it, could wait bad time training, gets thrown COVID ward one day. chose former. COVID ward ever since. emotionally physically drained exhausted, looking another nursing job (she's looking months hard deadline Thanksgiving). can't find one next week, giving moving home live parents take break working. loves nurse. like this. anymore. eight grueling months utter disregard people whose lives trying save. fucking disgusting. actually gonna say them, sure. That's cool actually vocal fans vs placating idiots sake $. like animal furs though. would insanity ban completely.  faith humanity rocked I'm really struggling trust people anymore.

My mother (who lives hour away seen since April) told yesterday father COVID least last 10 days. I'm pretty sure tell beginning pandemic gave parents lecture running around place knew would lecture again--which means clearly going places positive. Otherwise, would told earlier. brother happy grocery shopping drop things them, nope. insisted hard headed.  Floridiots. People shit like need fined. zero freaking enforcement mask mandates gathering size limits?? Remember people mention necessarily many people subreddit places outside US. ""pro-lockdown"" countries _does_ mean compensation affected workers. sounds like people say writers show ‚Äúhave‚Äù do. one wants lockdown lockdowns ‚Äúthey‚Äù can‚Äôt control everything. Great example. Safety measures put place reason. Seldom worst happen, does... 

That applies well pandemic: collectively safety measure, one maskless partygoers dropping bolts others wearing hardhats. odds eradicated worldwide zero. don‚Äôt see polio America doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs seen places brought US travelers. Hep B, whooping cough, rubella, tetanus, measles obviously still around pandemic epidemic level majority us vaccines, even it‚Äôs important remember vaccine 100% effective. get vaccinated, move on, live lives.  worried even though cheap, actually cost less $50. 

They charge $30 vaccine $100 administering $75 transportation costs $50 refrigeration fee. 

These companies good manipulating public opinion lying actual cost. it‚Äôs called billion pockets govt billions stock prices. Yes! mention credits section, chart inspired his. wanted data options one place. earth redditor posting matter? legit news article, legit news article. anyone shown evidence not. that, let's see get deleted false news stop arguing it. That‚Äôll go long way yes, vaccine actually brings us finish line.  difference three months make? already nine months observation.

This ignorant statement. 9 months vaccine *nothing*. That‚Äôs fastest ever huge margin (like 3 years). calculated risk severity pandemic. guarantee there‚Äôs way regulatory agency would even consider 9 month vaccine trial circumstances. Especially autoimmune disorders, reason mRNA vaccine prior one successful, take 2+ years show up. Going runoffs january, utmost sympathy. friend exactly like this.

Nice guy, hates listening news.

I suspect way escape negativity.  America country hear news Wasn‚Äôt POTUS‚Äôs newly appointed head spewing bunch dumb shit recently? different department? Yep. ICU Stipends twice normal pay rate that‚Äôs overtime multiplier. Every shift understaffed regardless. 

Meanwhile nurses returning normal staffing levels bunch laid start elective procedures cancelled. massacre. Deaths rates roughly consistent last year. facts lie regardless preconceived notions. wish could poop weekends. body trained give shit days off. 

Also suggest bidet one run again.  Gotta love Darwinism Likely series reasons:

* People literally deathbed still claiming hoax. (Think nurse SD said patient's last words along lines ""this hoax, virus"".)

* Working extra shifts short staffed colleagues caught quarantine. extra hours needed operating near, at, capacity. 

* Emotional toll seeing many people bad state prolonged period time.

* Fighting family members believe them, family members got mild case thus think everyone else making severity situation.

Basically, getting worn down. many thousands are. zero slow snowbirds coming I‚Äôve seen. feel good college students like fly home either. midwest surge specifically Sturgis rally. spike typical nationwide Halloween parties. states spiking form. hero. important remember that. fight good fight youngsters going out. sacrifice party going years may slow spread virus make really sick. great thing really big carrot motivate people. vaccine really work timeline distribute, good idea might end. messaging people hunker little bit longer. Articles like sending right message.

A months ago possibility vaccines would fail we'd need learn live virus accept losses. chance delaying inevitable that's luckily turning out. noticed spice have, TP need... tested positive getting AGAIN. July, tested negative August, I‚Äôve got again. I‚Äôm nurse positive patients, wear PPE there. Caught coughing coworker eating break room. Give heads‚Äô up. people start sense humanity. Americans won‚Äôt care number says 400k dead one day. 800k dead one day. Unless impacts someone close them. 

That‚Äôs America ya ‚Äî‚Äî got mine fuck you.

My neighbors left Colombia month Holiday. Don‚Äôt get it. doubt we‚Äôll reporting many though. Testing isn‚Äôt high enough even Wait minute... CoS took opportunity exclusionary push people away?

Yeah death rate 0.3% really much affect gene pool tbh One reasons like videos much make cited sources easily accessible, even jargon misleading, still read deeper comprehension like particular topic TRANSLATED AUTOMATICALLY VIA GOOGLE (so reliable physician working Ippokratio hospital Thessaloniki stressed employees forced call Prosecutor situation nightmarish.
He described darker colors borderline situation Hippocratic Hospital Thessaloniki located due huge volume work hospital's physician-intensivist.


Everything Christina Kidona emphasized antapocrisis.gr:

I intensive care physician, speak Covid physician work intensive care. experience Covid first wave pandemic Greece, moved AHEPA hospital reference center saw first cases treated Greece. 15 days ago called staff Covid clinic Ippokratio, created September 1 35 beds. However, November 1st suddenly turned 70 general duty, transferred Covid clinic together infectious disease specialist Athena Pyrpasopoulou could staff expansion clinic. 2-3rd November, 20th November talking you, increased 70 incidents vigil 240.

Many handed Agios Pavlos, Agios Dimitrios 424(both hospitals) order administration, beds could re-emptied could admit patients next general vigil, is, terrible recycling incidents, already paid beds. blue building managed expand old neoclassical building Hippocrates tonight occupy first building. forecast tomorrow morning exceed 300 beds. think understand numbers reflect whole truth.


When clinic began program November planned cover maximum 50 patients staff required cover 300 today. want talk fatigue, exhaustion, staff illness, well waves fear prevail hospital, take granted. want focus terrible conditions unsafe on-call hospitalization patients Hippocrates: wings average 50 people. blue building five wings across three floors staff 1 specialist physician 1 specialist physician every 50 cases.

Imports relate moderate cases. September October brought lot people watch, November stopped put moderate cases beds would reach beach. make aggressive discharges, is, wait complete escape disease, soon feel safe go home oxygen, take out. order free beds every 4 days Hippocrates reopen gates general hospital.

A specialist specialist 50 wing work 26 hours dressed uniform without rest cases least 30% heavy inside wings apply non-invasive mechanical ventilation, special vapors taken care provide keep sick non-intubated much possible, avoid admissions Intensive Care Unit beds available. Covid wards percentage cases normally according law treated there, Intensive Care Units (ICU) much medical nursing staff monitors.

Unfortunately, doctors support us, exhausted efforts staff may know pathology called ophthalmologists, ENT, surgeons, gynecologists, etc. impossible train one day use auxiliary hands blood sampling examination vital organs, etc. makes treatment conditions terribly unsafe sick. know criticism made got here, say passes. Unfortunately, however, midst great fire must propose solutions save world immediately.

Those take recycle dispersion city
We asked rent order hotels city get discharges still positive waited negative would beds. take recycle dispersion city. one may able sit alone another ten days home therefore stick one's family, may consist people belonging vulnerable groups. Thessaloniki, lockdown, unfortunately are, limit dispersion even evacuations return homes, create vicious circle.

We asked hotel units stay week, provided food, secretarial support cleaning given medicines need, something done city authorities. happen. asked request place create unit elderly people discharged need care go. happen either.

Thirdly, asked involvement army believe health could strengthen EKAB, even strengthen deliveries emergency units. happen either. finally, last week things going well, asked order private nurses Thessaloniki course already day yesterday insist order ICU beds private clinics absolutely nothing free.

The rate intubation Ippokratio 3 5 per day bed anywhere Northern Greece, already used in-bed respirators beyond safety limit.

We point longer feel tired due overexertion have, doctors Hippocrates may start shouting prosecutor tomorrow solution next intubations. solution tomorrow morning. may forced call prosecutor given way out.

Apart absolutely dangerous conditions hospitalization, describe situation experienced nursing staff. Today, speak, still afternoon shift, three nurses work shift average 45-50 patients need treated, clean whoever gets dirty, put vein whoever takes out, put oxygen back whoever stimulating throws them, happens, tell 20% cases. addition, must take food, distribute sick, feed give water. understand, addition this, contribute resuscitation intubation critical patient. see, apart fact nurse runs non-stop, done,


And explain: sick people eat many ability eat own. elderly, people 60s depressed, shortness breath, get bed, get open taper eat, even strength take bottle nightstand. want dramatic sense show, insist details illuminated anyone. words, talking staff depletion, overlooking moment, talking fact patients basics many times shift. humanly impossible them.

So terribly big crime, along small invisible crimes contains, think culprits many us denounced it. position, think, inside movement outside focus immediate solutions, least far Northern Greece concerned. is, emit SOS proposals clear, many possible saved. means tomorrow morning ICUs private clinics Thessaloniki open, wings private clinics Thessaloniki, request. tomorrow morning general vigil ends, reach 300 patients next vigil Tuesday. university forcing testing students using 100% remote learning? students aren‚Äôt even university surrounding community, living home. supposed hop plane risk exposure take saliva test flying back home? productive? students locked ONLINE classes? tens thousands people. compared many got sick vaccine, versus many got sick placebo. considered Biden pretty anti-lockdown. concerned virus isn‚Äôt pro-lockdown. pandemic dream alcoholics.

Sushi Smoked Salmon... economically hurting, get involved? Similarly judge every country rn taking action China North Korea running death camps. ""I dont care want"" irony, selfish Religion wolf sheep's clothing. another reminder.

Too bad local hospital can't deny members care -- They've made choice hasten return ""savior"", let go. Save finite medical resources actually want stay here.  first rhetorical question? difference one guy wins lottery 200.000 people day win covid. really choice. No, can‚Äôt. people choose go out, people die. rarely drank April 2020. vodka's regular item grocery list. 99.7% chance survival. even notice it. 100 strangers would sit close together multiple hours long haul flight?

I comment airlines safety, rather cannot say, example, recirculation bad. will. 

!remindme 4 weeks Probably impact people likely spread it, longer funds go party ends eventually, vaccine significantly help many people live normal life, rest kind deal suppose. Everyone ample opportunity get vaccine, honestly kind fault aside, anyone worried privacy sessions please note majority offices use secure video chat services designed healthcare use (aka zoom) Yes!! obvious going something similar totally understand saying voiced things life.

The logical sense needing medicine exist hope meaningful treatment, key word meaningful. still experiment, unknown scary!

One deciding factors access treatment market. Even fsa approves it, could take years get market. people would treatment available ones participated trial. fda quicker process trial orphan disease treatment, could still take years get market.

I wish best medical journey well. hope find meaningful treatment. Well, clear opinion disagree justifies righteous anger. Good know. ever heard phrase ""assume good intentions""? exactly problem, regard seniors, people preexisting conditions healthcare workers. Absolutely restrictions, allowing packed capacity enforcing masks. It‚Äôs sad. well awhile keeping bars open people careful, Desantis followed Trump‚Äôs lead acted like COVID isn‚Äôt problem. People participating contributing deaths family friends. Millennials bar scene general.

Even pre-Covid, crowded bar appealing Millennials idiots never stopped socializing. actually isolated brief period, seeing almost 200k new daily cases. complete bullshit stop spreading it. It‚Äôs huge impact. Daily new cases plummeted. Hospitalizations deaths lag weeks dropping steeply December that. give hope. called freedom. Bring downvotes. compared countries handeling well certainly not.. atleast restrictions show effect time US something Dark   started getting cough Tuesday.

I took saliva swab Wednesday came back negative. However, didn‚Äôt cough hard 3 times right test coughing line.

Also cough infrequent nothing like flu.

On Friday took test coughed came back negative.

Does sound like I‚Äôm fine ? worked Tuesday Friday mostly stayed office rarely around group people paper goes differential diagnosis images patients report last episode vaping week symptom onset. contrast COVID-19, GGOs EVALI pronounced centrally conspicuous subpleural sparing. lung zones may involved. Presence upper lobe‚Äìpredominant centrilobular nodules another useful differentiating feature.

I'm expert myself, appears distinguishing features lazy pull numbers trying explain concept European societies seem offer enviable combination freedom, security quality life. also associated unenviable mix shambolic governance draconian lockdowns, creaking public healthcare systems, individual irresponsibility unnecessary deaths.

The places handled virus (namely East Asia) people freedom travel, spend, go outside, enjoy life.  also freedom see hospitals shambles, people dying. 

It Asian societies actually offer enviable combination freedom, security quality life.

Every death COVID19 preventable one. Can't enjoy life dead, survive, can't enjoy quality life suffering aftermath. sounds familiar. start outbreak parents acting/thinking similarly. exactly know changed minds take much seriously. public facilities.

While Italy‚Äôs daily death tolls highest Europe recent days, increase hospital admissions intensive care occupancy slowed.

The number people hospital COVID-19 stood 34,279 Sunday, rise 216 day before. compared daily increase 106 Saturday.

The number patients intensive care rose 43, following increase 10 Saturday, stands 3,801.

When Italy‚Äôs second wave epidemic accelerating fast, around week ago, hospital admissions rising around 1,000 per day, intensive care occupancy increasing 100 per day.

The northern region Lombardy, centred Italy‚Äôs financial capital Milan, remained hardest hit area Sunday, reporting 5,094 new cases.

The southern region Campania, 60% Lombardy‚Äôs population, chalked second highest number new cases, Thats fair point. So. Bigger wave=deadlier? Wut? Local friend-of-a-friend died due ""clotting disorder"" following respiratory infection back around early May. back hospitals first slammed testing woefully inadequate, COVID widely recognized clotting disorder. Florida. think "" hoax, even isnt hoax constitutional right become infected, potentially infect others, one prove ingot infected"". dont care. It‚Äôs dying it‚Äôs spreading killing others don‚Äôt get? fucking problem. 

Stop thinking like this. 

Every one could catch it. Yes high survival rate, people infect afterwards may not. them, people infect, people that. 

But requires thinking logic people much days. Easter, said would gone Easter - April. easily spread virus going around. Next. Pfsh everyone knows Springfield, Oregon correct answer! think people need understand people true christians. idiots want hang friends snobs people wants get attention. insulting believers put group disgusting group people. looking reassuring words regarding pandemic,

If looking reassuring words hoping deluded tbh. Best face facts! 0.003% ages 0-19

0.02% ages 20-49

0.5% ages 50-69

5.4% ages 70+

Looking past irrelevant arguments American imperialism, it‚Äôs still ridiculous notion. Ethiopia FAR less deaths Covid-19 than, say, Switzerland. Still, single person earth would rather born Ethiopian Swiss. That‚Äôs exactly plan doing.

Like you, interest science. studied history university always lot interest way people act zero interest way machines act universe acts anything could deemed umbrella science.

I imagine one board scientific apparatus calculations this, available information pertaining vaccine development opinions wide range knowledgeable people (available internet click button).

The answer question come reasonable position. rule anything point reasonable. certainly automatically believe vaccine place back announcement relating data verified independent, authoritative people; hand think decent possibility stage when/if time comes rigourous review, take seriously digging vaccines work risks given comparatively short time frame terms development/trials.

A couple months ago, one finds employee working small office week gotten sick. suggested get test coming see us grandkids. get test? symptoms. think get test.

""Call doctor,"" said. ""Tell need covid doctor's office open Fridays. think we're okay.

""ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è""

They got tested though. Problem solved. week, find uncle positive. house days ago. We've debating getting together Thanksgiving. 

""You get tested. Obviously. I'm bringing family see that? get tested?

""ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è""

They make appointment get test doctor next day. couple hours appointment, kids want facetime grandparents. 

That's weird. Grandpa wearing sport jacket.

""Where guys? figured we'd get dinner go get test. never know, might last chance get house while.

I know guys read news. None new. None requires medical degree figure out. wrong people willful defiance political misinformation? like they've paying attention, simply understanding works. Also read quarantine! ü§òüèº that's allowed ""package stores"" stay open essential business, even lockdown periods. legit alcoholics get DTs die get booze, that's solution -- buy booze, private package store

Here article 2016 logic closing schools poling comment responded stamp head, good would stamp do? Tell person plane could potentially contracted it?

My point would useless there's chance contracting Covid grocery store. slows down. Government already stealing willful effort bring it! moving goalposts. case almost entire run coronavirus. using inaccurate stats make point. certainly Republican. somewhere cares people actually accurate. ok, arguing. said claim people younger 50 risk dying covid ""complete bullshit"". also said people careful spread around, certainly agree that.

Do wish rephrase, maybe apologize? ok take ibruprofen aspirin Covid? feel like it‚Äôs debunked worsens symptoms. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôve noticed, there‚Äôs line drawn, place live picked side. It‚Äôs vacationers went polls Election Day.
This going get worse here, I‚Äôm talking Covid Yeah none though. go eat places (indoors) operating orders. go see father law who's definitely high risk. justify saying overreacting covid. selfishness stupidity pure simple. take ICU bed overwhelm health system though. still show shortness breath symptoms ER, take hours evaluated discharged home. room get decontaminated next one. That's ER bed commission several hours others could use. strain even worse patients waiting ICU beds stuck ER, making ER spots even precious. Yes. numb nearly 2.5 million people die US annually. would emotionally exhausting otherwise.
Instead, focus people lives know personally. 
I think something like people dying starvation Yemen lot tragic people dying sickness human-caused could easily solved so. That's rough. Imagine lot factors play. Family influence, friend influence etc... etc... might even paid beholden someone else. said mask wearing something control opted exercise right. strange time friendships. Good hear. considering trying work Canada 45 got reelected. workplace considering 100% WFH options, COVID contained (we're 100% WFH now, temporary basis.) Good Riddance really.

Unfortunately there's money churches people worshipping privately greater loss personal freedom death. believe personal freedom important maintained even leads deaths others(and thus loss freedom), really care *concept* freedom, care yourself. Heritage excuse sounds nice, reality selfish want burdened save fellow man. Trump nothing would literally better done. Unfortunately, point clearly obvious before. friends neighbors caring, certain members law enforcement entire departments defiant, saying refuse mask enforce laws masks distancing, even school districts openly defiant it.

Let's forget every day joe openly defiant facebook puffing chest proudly live fear, I'll damned anyone tells otherwise.

If like mostly ridden thing home elderly, compromised relatives hold little longer. vaccines hope many given care anymore. Come think it, FLA voted Red, guess don‚Äôt care Biden wants.  visalia, fresno, bakersfield?  Inequality ""baked into"" almost every facet lives.

I know common Reddit rules read article replying. summarized as, ""life easier money"". many 31k possibly asymptomatic still it? incredibly careless condem stupid ass behavior Wow Ideally everybody. something would better nothing Haha Really? say ""overlooking rest"" providing data point whatsoever. ""rest?"" Rather, make assumption earlier travel habits false without providing evidence. 

If show people travelling leisure season, provide evidence it. Rather don't. dismiss it. 

Again, show data majority recent fliers flying leisurely purposes. bit late party; almost halfway 12 13 million already.  next big issues convincing people get it. read correctly, least 75-80% country would need get it. I've heard neighbors plan getting (""made quickly,"" ""Democrat conspiracy,"" ""COVID real,"" etc.), I'd concerned enough people take effective society overall (meaning return normalcy). try interstate travel ban would almost certainly overturned court.

Good news Jan 20th. less Coronavirus less early morning twittervirus. Careful one user said talking like get u trouble mods depression one something ill need look into, that's really interesting. 

Anecdotally me, 20 something age group, depression drug dependency sky rocketed lockdown. many friends legitimately struggling alcoholism smoking ounces month, suicidial ideation, etc become daily talking point they're either overworked social life, locked inside permanently. Well 1912 Spanish flu started Kansas, USA, absolutely right. health care workers dying, quarantining, quitting, increased number severely affected patients probably holidays, I'm predicting many, many hospitals turning away seriously ill can't accommodate them. I'm betting people die waiting rooms hallways...again. may well backfire since Biden taking office holiday surge plateau start decline anyway. dude. We're together, apart Omelette eggs, I‚Äôd guess. :( mean, original reply near top comment string.

Nearer poster‚Äôs comment fact. ""In short, without taking drastic measures, healthy optimistic among us doom vulnerable. fight fire grows high. extreme restrictions may seem, end, little anticlimactic. really hard feel like saving world watching Netflix couch.

But right, nothing happens. Yeah. successful shelter place means going feel like nothing. right. nothing means nothing happened family. that's we're going here.""

Dr. Emily Landon speaks COVID-19 Illinois governor's press conference
March 20, still risk spread higher risk be. real. religious nuts pray get better leave science, hospital beds real care us aren‚Äôt death cult. seem know difference right wrong anymore

and objectively say right wrong Stupid shit inability understand definition ‚Äúlong term effect‚Äù - maybe forgot tell people also felt 20 years younger covid lol hope right! Nice moving goal posts. 

Were going Thanksgiving week minimum 250k deaths 12M cases. 

The real death toll doesnt fully reap cost hospitals capacity, guess dingus, direct correlation active cases. 

Again look like dont know fuck talking about. Go defend shit republican ideology work die somewhere else. Hey, need explain lot people, refer studies mentioned :) even doesn‚Äôt seem matter. Dad lives Florida going bars every night singing karaoke. got virus 20 days ago, couldn‚Äôt even stay quarantined 5 days inviting GF over.

He‚Äôs still symptomatic otherwise completely back normal again, since it‚Äôs 14 days. like it, words HATE it. actor one least difficult privileged jobs earth nerve HATE country (the system taxpayer) makes job possible first place. 

Either get egocentric high horse learn humility leave. Honestly sure write stuff without ashamed yourself, move actual shithole country instead safe comfy first world see much hate afford country  minimal stuff early on. supposed getting better testing, contact tracing, PPE meantime, none happened, wasted. that, it‚Äôs control, well way million dead over.

And calling people idiots giving damn telling facts reality. sad life live.  Ask 5 people would probably get 5 different replies.

But imo

Skip supermarket buy none processed foods, cook yourself. Go back seeing processed foods treat odd occasion, everyday.

Avoid vegetable oils

Don't eat least 14 hours day

Don't snack

Increase protein

Exercise, fair amount low level like walking, bit intense cardio lifting.

Reduce carbs, especially anything high GI GL, much reduce carbs imo really depends damaged individual is.  Bullies disgusting... anti-mask bullies dumb disgusting. Oh yeah democrats want take guns ask us wear piece cloth face holes. Makes sense. None anti-mask people protesting wearing clothes government also makes wear public... kind hypocritical ask me. protesting naked feel strongly forced wear articles clothing lol Forget Thailand, look difference US/UK poorest African nations Eh, I'd careful saying uneducated. Many educated fundamentally different view government. Many people reddit mistake fundamental difference world view lack education. They're same. 

Many people view government solution problems want little government possible. fundamentally think government's place provide food medicine people functions handled local communities. know explicitly said. Melbourne one strictest longest lockdowns world.

All liquor stores stayed open whole time considered essential. complicated. US big country numbers vary widely (although going everywhere now, necessarily high everywhere). people NY California completely halt lives people Iowa can't wear god damn mask (and unlike March, enough testing know what's going where)? mean one answer yes, virus gone, sadly lack leadership general societal that.

I gone anywhere two weeks, neither parents, Thanksgiving together. half country selfish, short-sighted idiots? I'm flying, can't blame anyone they're carefully (wearing good mask + goggles/face shield, eating plane, quarantining, getting tested seeing family, etc.). become endemic deal vaccines distributed global population herd immunity builds. us keep spread nurses like wife deal selfish actions assholes like think world nothing else. 

I would pay money brought tour see young people fighting life, people denied access due overcapacity unnecessary tragedy actions care. Maybe get realize hey, maybe sit one out. One issues that, yes, people spread it, many spread contract it, reinforce belief exceptional. literally one single year needed skip traditional holidays keep exploding.

This right here.  shall call GOP Camps. uh oh, made joke China totalitarian upset hive mind sub. sentence 1 year re-education camp 100 point reduction social credit score Question: Thanksgiving bonfire outdoors bad idea too, given cases rising? Masked possible? Disposable plates etc, still communal turkey? perish, 20 years find serious health impacts event. What's cost? Same. term ends Thanksgiving don‚Äôt go back late January think students uni flying home now. Meh, people suck, pretty would assume opposite actually. Pregnant woman often included clinical trials concerns baby. I'm pretty sure excluded trial. lack data, doctors tend conservative recommending drugs pregnant women. exceptions (like flu vaccine) that's ton data research. doubt there's enough research covid vaccine. need 225 million people, though. inaccurate. Careful now, sort talk get banned sub. I'm going rob take things. That's life. Sorry. wheel weaves. That's happening article. realize current date it‚Äôs counterpart 2019 top right?  Thursday morning, 28 COVID-19 patients intensive care, 12 spilling beyond designated unit areas designed heart problems, strokes surgical recoveries. total 97 COVID-19 patients admitted Regions, almost full.
Minnesota‚Äôs experience pandemic suggests one-third patients ventilators won‚Äôt survive, even optimal critical care.


THIS. part people roll eyes high survival rate understand. spilling beyond designated unit areas designed heart problems, strokes surgical recoveries

And beginning big wave. C-19 patients flooding hospitals wearing staff taking resources. 

I can't life figure people can't comply 1 month. means, stay home. work, get it. please wear mask properly, wash hands, keep distance. 

And know people play nicely:

Minnesota 11/22/20 12:46pm


CASES: 270,157
DEATHS: 3,297

RemindMe! 1 month get completely unprovable idea? ""Traumatized"" ... lol.

God hope never anything serious like civil war, real economic collapse, real pandemic country. never election nobody coming save arguing restrictive measures places need reduce spread fact exactly that. Decade Yay! factory South Africa. referring civil rights movement what? refusing admit US made huge swaths people second-class citizens? 

I'm refusing all. countries fair share problems shameful pasts. denying Uyghurs brutally oppressed China? fantastically racist stupid thing say. would definitely rather get Ethiopian citizenship. least Ethiopian people beautiful culture, unlike white demons actively destroying planet. 

I concede remark sounded bad. used demonyms like that. Still, stand point. born Switzerland gives vastly greater chances fulfilling life born Ethiopia. no, that's material conditions. Ethiopia ripe corruption, torture [extrajudicial little bit like China. Plus bunch folks worse places want travel sunny California holidays ignore 2 week quarantine period visitors. understand negative karma

Because went reddit echo chamber, that's :\^)

As me, summer/fall chock full east coast underground parties, mind outdoor camp-outs.  
And single-digit occasions cops showed noise complaints, give two shits 'masks' 'social distancing'. left us alone said ""the masks work well."" 

Fuck, remember earlier month one close friends seizure **right fuckin front me** despite party kept going! Hell week ICU usually enough top million. Joe Biden president-elect now, argument make sense point would make Biden look bad enters also control

I keep hearing people like say this, seem like like using word thinking making point. Stop fear mongering.  Meanwhile, got quarantined work, sent home get tested, put work-from-home mentioning fatigued + found partner exposed 2 weeks prior night before.

The varying level precautions across country staggering stupidity choosing anti-mask wearing hill die friends loved ones. basically nothing. big difference ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going get sick die‚Äù ‚Äúyou get sick get others sick potentially cause deaths‚Äù. first statement false claim spread panic. second statement factual promotes mindfulness actions consequences around us. 

And reason don‚Äôt talk long-term complication simply it‚Äôs soon. isolated cases possible post-covid strokes, certainly enough really connect dots. 

My point people dying this, even elderly people. even then, they‚Äôre still people. don‚Äôt deserve get sick die like that. girlfriend works covid pts ICU nurse. She‚Äôs experiences horrors past 8 months people never experience lifetime. 

All I‚Äôm asking people empathy mindfulness. hasn‚Äôt happened anyone know, doesn‚Äôt mean someone isn‚Äôt suffering disease. it‚Äôs spreading like wildfire point may hit home.

Just wear mask. stay home holidays. Keep distance people. That‚Äôs it. According studies, day symptom onset, day symptom onset. Diamond Princess study reported infectiousness peaked 0.7 days prior onset symptoms. Obviously estimates. clinical data, also see ""SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior symptom onset"" Staying home idea. Staying home family friends. And, family meeting honest best control potential spread others folks others need concerned about. live state tightest restrictions governor apologize getting caught breaking them. agree, yet another Sweden bashing post. joke understanding another language. literally nothing covid. Lighten up. It‚Äôs Florida China hook again? It‚Äôs evil. blatant example zero empathy, psychologist G. M. Gilbert, worked army oversee defendants Nuremberg trials said:

‚ÄúIn work defendants searching nature evil think come close defining it. lack empathy. It‚Äôs one characteristic connects defendants, genuine incapacity feel fellow men.

Evil, think, absence empathy.‚Äù Mask protocol perhaps? article really mention much need mask roam around, use bathroom such, likely need mask; however, seat eating whatever, policies probably lighter, anyone sitting area susceptible infection. Pharmacies instant adjudication. claim would denied processed instantly. apply urgent cares ERs real time adjudication. Honestly, cares? bound run one arbitrary-ass interpretations ""incivility"" eventually. sure people suddenly start listen. strong weakest parts.....who beleive sky god save us masks evil? That's fine. Wait deaths start reaching millions U.S. everybody knows someone died COVID. Might flippant then... Basically. People hate Trump think acts ‚Äúunstable‚Äù Biden‚Äôs policies likely worse Trump. People likely worse financially four years time. I‚Äôm expecting Biden last two years. people area ignore stories.  numbers way up. fair true. know idiots care much. got several disputes mom's neighbors let house required masks outdoors, coming check bring gifts.

 really bad risk assessment coming mix bad information. Every movie happy ending teaches us we're immortal, subconsciously simply can't believe it. misinformation effective easy disregard things would require change habits.

Also keep mind people care much risking lives (""I'd rather die able help neighbors problem"") realizing could give care about. falsely believe they'd able tell someone know sick, take l wear mask ""clearly"" they're safe.

This classic example of: never attribute malice attributed incompetence. Ah, internal email discusses phenomena colleagues proof Sweden using herd immunity strategy? Wow, conclusive evidence...

I guess I'll get raise tomorrow, since discussed salary uncle yesterday! lot travelers likely students coming home university campuses. closing thanksgiving opening January. Students don‚Äôt really choice, get home somehow  like everyone's sitting asses delay purpose. FDA thoroughly reviewing every inch ensure safety efficacy. fuck get said? only. allowed shoot pythons sight. nearly entire nation including black latino communities. 1994 crime bill unanimously approved Senate. Biden almost Democratic party realizes 1994 bill big mistake he, Harris, many high ranking Democratic officers pushing hard criminal justice reform drug decriminalization. Guess blocking policies saying ""soft crime""? Nov 4th date superseded references posted. LOL. forget, ""there nothing could done differently!"" Im hopeful Canada well reason government scientists shit optimism like want continue reason Exceptionalism hubris. reads like Greek tragedy. contrary, movies like contagion look unrealistic competent government movie Well boo-hoo them. Ignore public health guidelines want get sick, feel badly it. people get ill, certain percentage actually came contact covid (and get ill bc vaccine). probably calculated many gotten sick (based local infection rates), inferred 95% protection rate (8/n = .05 whatever) she‚Äôs literally covering ears saying ‚ÄúLa la la la la‚Äù instead informed. 

She's literally muting group chat. *figuratively* covering ears. Mate people wear masks definitely lining vaccinated /s used strong tone lecture someone admitted don‚Äôt think breaking rules?

Pick narrative. Actually like 10 days, that's 'weeks' you?--Patience, something rushed, lot stake #Yay lets celebrate job never coming back!! They're going elephant graveyard. learn anything else experience?  I‚Äôm sorry bleak, I‚Äôm pretty sure entitled folks bitching mask orders lockdowns next bitching fact beds available loved ones.

However, stage government medical system knew looking able get cases provinces control relatively quickly (the fact varying degrees lockdowns imposed half country helped immensely too). purposefully much longer trip usual year. usually go 2 weeks, year we're going December (and bringing dog case decide stay put longer). gives us time actually quarantine arrive (and follow state's testing protocol). agree people turn Thanksgiving long visit. Idk 400,000 deaths day seems like lot. insurance companies get reimbursed govt. Good thing able edit Ah yes, South Korea New Zealand. Two countries famed mass extra-judicial killings. aunt uncle guilting daughter children come Thanksgiving Texas since ""their year host."" mom backed days ago gathering even though we're local. I'm Australia basically everyone side globe done well except Indonesia Malaysia. 

China exception here. numbers line everyone else's.

Also, best medical practice clinical knowledge mean jack hospitals choked. Medical staff first among top spreaders far less medical staff chronically ill people. Using vaccine stop spread far effective simply giving vulnerable reality vulnerable people ones chronic illness, also ones likely contract it.

SO need nurse help keep alive regular basis high risk get it, we've seen nursing homes. people spontaneously getting old, medical staff spread nursing homes. 

With limited amount vaccines think save people limiting spread. autoimmune patients need constant attention, low risk infection even high risk lethality.

**There two types vulnerable here. Vulnerable infection job living conditions and/or vulnerable viral load lethality.** people likely 4am? normal people asleep, get downvoted oblivion later? 200K even peak. 

* Collapsed Healthcare system every state full near collapse. Things almost still work cases we're going get point beds, meds tons nurses, doctors Healthcare workers walking job real chance dying. 

* Homelessness joblessness rise even spiked yet. people get sick transmit likely people leave jobs due lack sick leave already jobless likely evicted middle pandemic. 

* Riots follow bread circuses gone Americans lack one both. I'll flabbergasted (And relieved) violence reach representatives. 

* Good luck funerals. backlog turn impossible sooner rather later. 

You see right months building population cared caring other. nations ""industrially oriented"", meaning place heavy emphasis achieving prosperity industrialisation.

In West, particularly US/UK, general trend de industrialization taking economy services oriented path.  I'm US go school Germany. 

It's annoying. Sure US vocal anti vaxx minority they're that: stunning minority. Germany, people silently believe vaccines. someone option get COVID vaccine refuse, literally care get sick. mean you‚Äôre probably right Yep, go hospital Shanghai busier prior pandemic. difference make register entrance contact tracing purposes. think subreddit full mentally ill people feeding negative shit find. sub particular gets fear. It‚Äôs basically big ‚Äúholier thou‚Äù circle jerk. Turkey good though /s misspelled ""kill grannies"". Kill neighbour like yourself, famous Christian principle, huh? Christian pond let say bottom heart: Fuck you, i≈Übred cavity dowels MURICA. Given shortages vaccine production, make difference, make scheduling easier. dislike commentary want. flowery.

But calling ""cherry picking"" whole point he's writing.

How else propose answer question ""what worst performing countries results matched best?""

And, give due, hammer best v worst, actually points western countries criticizing could twice three times worse best still incredibly better results.

It might surrounded dubious cultural judgements, central point worst responses \*orders magnitude\* worse best seems pretty uncontroversial. vaccination doesn‚Äôt start April. Everyone expects start December. get you‚Äôre saying, I‚Äôm worried it. Starting next month we‚Äôre *finally* going putting opposing force rising covid numbers. Vietnam, country 95 million, 35 deaths. China 100 times that, it‚Äôs surprising considering dealt SARS, that‚Äôs literally came from. worries, Bill gates would say he's scientist. Computer science subset mathematics. pretty funny even question Basically everyone North Australia done well except Indonesia Malaysia. China exception part world. GET it, means vaccinating spreaders effective strategy. 

Like nursing home, old people high risk death, also high risk infection regardless outcome, medical staff bringing virus constantly. easier vaccinate 30 nurses 300 old people case. 

I would focus front-line industries spread virus virus lethal, highly infectious RO damage virus, lethality. last time. Stop spreading fake news! You‚Äôre island let rip. Excellent plan /s many willfully ignorant people country, need see headlines maybe sink in. many cases Singapore had? 58,160

Most cases dormitories. many cases, Singapore oblivious fact dormitories would high risk. something average Singaporeans would boast about. This! assume people travel Christmas time Thanksgiving,. Yeah sat back nothing except shut borders. picnic far, actually /süôÑ I'm saying control now, I'm saying truly naive believe numbers. saying country aggressively oppressed anyone even mentioned virus, tried bury lied world completely transparent death toll. hit first internationally, zero time prepare, health systems collapse city millions, 4,600 deaths population billion. 

I get thinking. get views probably little skewed due Chinese Communist Party's part-ownership Reddit, still astounding people rightly doubt words coming Western politicians, blindly accept China. Facebook 1000x damaging fox news. I'll file under, ""of fucking course are"". GOOD! hope gets much more! 

Whoever's suffering needs strike, occupy government offices things improve long-term! IIRC, Sydney 30% Asian. Australia whole 10-15% Asian. 

The demographic quite different Europe Americas.

Also, white Aussies lot chill understandable. gonna go lockdown cuz there's pandemic? Yeah alright, fair enough. No. tend skew healthier though less obesity. 

Everyone know socializing less it‚Äôs bc people moved outdoors, indoors (I‚Äôm portland). 

It seems obvious AF Covid seasonal, people keep trying find moral reason everyone must earned Covid. New Zealand huge island? lol no. per usual, belittle efforts countries make excuses. lot travelled around Europe summer holidays, spread disease further. haven‚Äôt even put effort  Yeah nursing homes, high risk infections, high risk lethality. old people nursing homes need nurses constantly spreads disease rather tight confines. 

However really medical staff that's spreading virus vaccinating stop spread effective trying vaccinate much larger number highest risk people first.

So really big risk nursing homes still medical staff vaccinated mostly. nurse who‚Äôs travelling country spend time elderly. Fuck sake. really hope Americans. talked amount 9//11 style events shook nation resulted action we'd day. COVID biggest one bombings key strategy ignore problems. Iran culturally eastern seems managed western style policies results.  sister nurse traveling. taking COVID seriously convinced study. there‚Äôs already sibling-pressure.

I‚Äôd drive could, it‚Äôs long drive finals week like day later (distant learning teacher).

There‚Äôs things play (personally) I‚Äôm wanting disclose Reddit.

But appreciate advice. could take would. profoundly stupid country. simple that. going catastrophic Americans, thanksgiving Canada weeks ago cases went x4 even worse spots. sort handle things understand quickly turn south. Child-lock parents Foxnews station random password* always thought stores busy early morning contractors pick last minute stuff heading jobs. Fauci person right trying pilot Titanic keep functional hull deck everyone else breaking shit ship crashes right iceberg faster. Dudes everything many *don't care.* worst. 

What's absurd people encouraging breaking know COVID massive problem hold power form. much pointless death. Worldometer reports 251,790 deaths 12,450,666 cases death rate 2.15, I'll go along death rate 1% sake argument since death rate deniers always pull asses. Even half actual death rate, 1%, 124,500 deaths, many. Well sound like atrocious person. Yeah particularly jarring me, anything, states follow east asian development model (korea, japan, china, taiwan, vietnam, singapore) dominated technocratic decision making Dunno either, stuff solidified decision move another country get vaccinated. Fuck shit hole. bf‚Äôs family dinner 5 different households, lot risk. sister also went Las Vegas Thanksgiving day exactly 2 weeks since went, parties left right friends. they‚Äôre PISSED bf decided thanksgiving year. bf hasn‚Äôt social distancing (goes Jiu Jitsu hangs friends) I‚Äôd feel terrible anything happened family. it‚Äôs like one thanksgiving, don‚Äôt understand need celebrate year years. course lockdowns become harder enforce, especially law enforcement right-wing politicians claiming hoax. Article Italy, published Italian research team.

Comment section: ChYna! CCP bot!

Don't ever change, Reddit. Greece less deaths per 1 million international average agree people highest risk contract get first, highest risk die contract it. stop spread lethality faster unless vaccine also works counter disease early something odd. mean SAVE dying person sure use it, high risk people high risk virus spread place. spread risk, much lethality hospitalized people die even suffer. lol you‚Äôre really quoting number ‚Äúdemocracy index‚Äù. We're national Jim Jones moment. wouldn‚Äôt bother tbh. It‚Äôs worth risk guilt would feel killed gran. 2 person per 1 second. funny. Father lives alone lady friend who's careworker brings dates. 2 careworkers days, I've idea bubbles looking like.  
I stern conversation Father waiting January see her. understands, got pretty angry time, told awful negative, hung me. hurt. also felt like jerk Dad's alone know that's tough. 

He called next day. reminded loved trying look him. quiet, apologized said understood. call every day sure drop everything calls chat.  
Loneliness hard thing, especially older folks - sure Dad, zoom calls, play online scrabble, even watch tv show together phone, whatever do. start saving OURSELVES. concern defeating Covid19. Kinda like airplane loses cabin pressure. mask first, help others. Gotta start somewhere. Anyone would complain serious lockdown implemented government properly distancing others pandemic.

It takes strong leadership that, absence strong leadership people need take accountability get done. puts envelope, tapes it‚Äôs obvious says walmart associate. couple wouldn‚Äôt take first though. One women jumped though. Theoretically speaking, vaccine contraindicated nursing mothers. available vaccines (for disease), ones contraindicated nursing mothers live attenuated virus vaccines. 
And none Covid candidate vaccines fall category.

Pregnancy lot harder sort though, many possible mechanisms could affect developing fetus. I'm hard pressed think anything could go breastmilk result vaccine could harm nursing baby, live virus. jail makes sense higher risk get it. Smokers make sense all. Obese makes sense, that's like people right bat many doses.

I think using vaccine target spread effective giving vulnerable. mean theoretically correct Luxembourg needs stuff comparing numbers US numbers work all. 


The equivalent 4000 deaths US Luxembourg is....8. 8 deaths per day obviously bad manage get single death less per day already equivalent 3500. 
Those vast difference population numbers really screw statistics. 


The scary part comparing numbers european countries. Luxembourg smaller lot thus higher population density lot countries &lt;6 million people. somewhat correctly compare statistics. seriously considering telling no

Considering? fuck? Tell already. little pressure healthcare system, reason locking flatten curve process achieving herd immunity, deaths due hospital capacity happen. elderly imuno compromised need lock well whomever live with. Nobody else dies. mortality rate rapidly dropped that's viruses do. people getting immediately spreading either unluckiest people already spreading Nobody knows much mRNA vaccines? idiots don‚Äôt know anything vaccines whatever article read says, quit stupid fucking comments. Next year families sit around table Thanksgiving give thanks sacrifice made seeing Thanksgiving 2020. 

Other families sit around table next year Thanksgiving forever empty seats table. New Zealand issued mask mandate August 25. Extremely late compared countries. lot countries already think people likely contract virus vs likely die lethality low rate infection high, mathematically makes sense me. digging mass graves. Without doubt. choose fan - science pretty clear - virus grows increasingly dangerous patient gets older.

Doesn‚Äôt mean zero risk anyone vaccines need given kind order. million years ago, half Australia fire start year, saw comment ""This might worst fire season 20 years. bright side, best fire season next 20 years"" would thinking targeting spread would actually effective lethality kind low RO kind high, want hit strength, infectiousness. People interact people lot spread virus top candidates fastest results. stats instances Covid brought USA via Mexico Canada? believe there's restrictions place borders non-essential travel since March?

Without looking stats, I'd assume imported covid cases USA would come via air sea, Australia NZ. west busy worrying *their freedom*. hypocrisy lies majority wanting sacrifice deaths simple concept freedom. Thank you! Yeah totally.

I travel Christmas grandma basically forcing us guilt. I‚Äôm going double masked, gloved, face shield. health care system certainly collapse end December. negativity bias hits ya! Great movie! know gut says maybe. could probably 40 million people come back vaccine. could make big difference vunerable. Yeah totally seemed like correcting you, tbh going edit don‚Äôt even know would salvage comment short deleting :D sorry lol Interesting read article summing up. Might correct. Seems airs filtered every 2 minutes particle size Covid larger enough filter. 

Also ‚ÄúThe testing assumed one infected person plane simulate effects passenger movement around cabin.‚Äù Still something look though. mistake interviewed bat Mandarin. Bat understand. start speaking Italian, bat confessed. lot people kill parents grandparents. vaccine comes out. Fucking feels bad man. wish would take shit seriously, last thing want rushed vaccine. Sadly that's gonna option. FB problem mirror held already selfish society? paying attention? That‚Äôs exactly government luck it'll twins change fatherdozen! think it‚Äôs selfish stupid. Sounds like *you* don't. workout intense, assure you. Trump take vaccine live television inject Barron maybe lead example. nope, can't that, critical thinking blood, fyi, critical thinkers world would've burned ash long long time ago lol things like computers, cars, planes, radios, telephones, defined laws physics, on...the world NEEDS critical thinkers...so again, no, sorry, can't stop critical thinker germany parliamentary democracy name 

but hindenburg always held power. army weimar thinly veiled reformed reality still Prussian militaristic army existed weimar. 

I'm referring hitler's germany 1930s know, gassing holocausting. 

We see facism but, without opportunity historical hindsight, 1930s western democracies stuck economic depression seemed like goddess fortuna favored italy, germany, japan, soviet russia instead. Surely would cemented western democracies failed help weaker members alliances Czechoslovakia, poland, etc. 

It's different australia falls influence china, hong kong losing special status, etc. militaristic diplomatic economic means. see Hoovervilles popping many major american cities, san francisco, los angeles, san jose, many places. homeless camps streets filled crazy drug addicts live. 

It's reminiscent history Seeing OP agreeing theory, question make sense. That's like asking someone source opinion neighbors' hosting block parties increases odds struggling find parking space. I‚Äôm still waiting shrew tried get us fined HOA quarantine trailer driveway month known exposure...

I like think time, even fervent dreams United States would come eclipsed reality.

I think reason much discussion America handling Covid much world looks America. 

I'll leave clip intro Newsroom. hope America comes side pandemic reborn new fervour better world. Probably also ignoring undercount, well incoming holiday season, winter least local healthcare collapses

I'll take one. always jump Springfield Massachusetts. basketball hall fame there. even worse that. Lawyers, lobbying groups, special interests least clue want achieve.

The West bluntly increasingly simply run propagandists. That's widespread belief Western governments - particularly highest levels politics business - simply PR problems away.

This also tend assume non-Western governments also trying PR problems away instead actually taking effective measures.

The problem really, contrary toxic individualism talk, Westerners actually conformist people. That's easily fooled PR Facebook posts. fact desperate ""fit in"" - hence many deluding believing wearing masks makes cool patriotic, rather public health hazard. live MA, regarded educated state. proper lockdowns, police enforce anything, people wear masks, people wear masks correctly, people social distance, people think virus hoax, people think measures take enough clear enforced thus mean nothing. that's one city, multiple cities towns state like this. 

Education means nothing population chooses ignore said education, pandemic proves education help. short memory see Reading feels like reading diary different century, country culturally similar mine. job organized us groups someone got quarantined entire group would get quarantined. symptoms get time pay. temp workers well.

The us needs revolution. correlation. Sadly commercial pharma gain further/fast investigation. university's move slowly, usual. Yeah classic correlation, basically always anytime vit mentioned, proven countless times vit supplement follow studies anything. Frail people lower vit counts get sick often, therefore vit gets bundled possible cure preventative.

[easy find Where‚Äôs coincidence? know ilness named frank sinatra gang? Crohn-ner's disease. need depression first People don‚Äôt realize cost developing blockbuster drug treats 10,000-100,000 people. start talking millions billions, it‚Äôs easy make money lower costs, especially governments guarantee contracts needs national mandate. bar needs license revoked. Anti-maskers afflicted mental illness. must hear talk. afraid mask cause self harm, push mental illness breaking point.

People practice meditation likely antithesis anti-maskers. know, things like it‚Äôs easy say let catch coronavirus see God. 
But end infecting people outside congregation it‚Äôs fucked up. Yes point making. saying ""india bad got xxx death"" invalid argument. want say ""india bad per capite death rate high"" sure, go it. health department free drive type operation. country 10x death rate immediate neighbors global pandemic, pretty clear baseline expect followed similar measures. Sweden's approach led needless deaths roughly 6,000 citizens counting. Well, there's 12.5m cases, death rate 1%; many die another ... oh, 300 million get infected? Yeah, 3 million. Let's hope even wrong. Didn‚Äôt wanna see relatives anyway. I‚Äôll nice small thanksgiving lady fat turkey personal observation, Boomers following safety guidelines least all. also thought meant alleged new strain alleged shorter incubation period didn‚Äôt read article regimen 15k IU, multivitamin, fish oil

Edit - try pair food maximum absorption

Shit double edit 15k UI vitamin Oh we're believing Chinas numbers now???? months told like UK Europe, we're beating half almost half deaths goal line pulled back competing numbers China... EVERYONE knows lying plushie? teddy bear, except case bear penguin? illegal deploy military police US.

Also official state border crossings, can't shut every road crosses state lines. Yeah nobody wait that. People choosing take mild risk order live lives, like million things daily, 'epidemiologists' tell everyone right see family. control

Exactly. Exactly thoughts üòûüòû Yes, yes will. Hate see this. Small study still disheartening. Looking research Pretty sure compare per capita countries like Thailand/Cambodia/Laos/Vietnam would still huge disparity countries world I'd honestly shocked lockdown 2025. almost zero faith round one vaccines effective, along overzealous governors wanting continue lockdowns indefinitely. gonna get bad next summer. That‚Äôs dark asf point everyone like year Thank you.

I‚Äôm less concerned catching virus mental heath burden taking point. work load, deaths, deniers lot.

I listen lighten load, snd even set great therapist month since started, it‚Äôs still much one person carry. Wow, actually lost it. Maybe isolated long. give shit. China communist country want. info minority true info going rest world. China enormous number trolls, probably one, covering information showing good country. leaders care citizens. said lawyers. Yes, dictatorship collars. real information COVID19 there? polution, mass destruction country? think no. Yeah, bad things happening 2020. hometown üíî mine partner's families decided cancel Thanksgiving things bad there. want us travel, told us many people still wearing masks. I'm worried them. I've cancelled holiday plans foreseeable future, worth risk. mention pretty much everyone camera phone, call wish well. #dEmOcRaT hOaX Please someone tell stocks make embalming supplies. Probably sound investment guaranteed pay off. predicted 5 million beginning pandemic. really want wrong that. soft toy Everything except Reddit, right? good read. Mind boggling, mind boggling.

It's sad woman refusing mask's vulnerable sister gets sick despite mother's precautions, argue ""see mom, need wear masks change life, work anyway!"" work people like her, healthy go place precaution they're invincible might become vector. ""we never started calling social distancing. called physical distancing. basic concept language we‚Äôve used try deter people physically together ‚Äî could still kind community regardless that?‚Äù

100% Wow, that‚Äôs crazy. live Florida, anyone ever shocked Florida. Colorado really surprised me. thought guys beacon sanity science west. 

A lot spread Florida private gatherings. People casually visiting one another‚Äôs homes. 

The vast majority people large cities wear masks inside businesses. people decide get together.. well, isn‚Äôt lot government it, know? It‚Äôs people. 

Stay safe! None would exist without ad-revenue. Follow money. Spread went almost zero many places northern hemisphere summer, quick assign improvements various mitigations. 

Closing borders quarantining international arrivals also luxury remote countries do. may done right doesn‚Äôt mean Denmark France could copy success. throw em BBQ.  teacher district in-person students terrified happen Thanksgiving Christmas.  Every year much sickness kids travel country bring back bugs everywhere, year COVID too. critically sick kids, plus chas kids forced quarantine exposure, probably kids dealing disease death families. know families still travel COVID knowingly spread ""its bad"". heartbreaking. Umm.. huh? sources maybe? went little sideways that. I've already read that, understand works, taking least 6 months I've seen others react. choice right choose (which do). period, everything looks fine, take it, before. 

Providing information already read dozen places going change mind using basically untested vaccine day released. thanks input. Also draws lot ooohs ahhhhs. Followed feeling able breathe. Ima travel fridge grab beer travel back computer play video games Nah, we‚Äôll probably lock then. Many schools won‚Äôt reopen thanksgiving. know battlefield plans never survive contact enemy? Well, coordinating federal action US like that, populace enemy. talk good game around preparedness, think could collectively fight way wet paper sack point. won‚Äôt see bad it‚Äôll couple weeks. Christmas New Years going absolute worst know India part Asia, right? family barely even get come holidays covid, live city. travel? They‚Äôd never see me. expect accepted. much money stake. 1 month later

It‚Äôs 20k cases couple states. We‚Äôre fine!

5 years later

Help please internet everyone love dead can‚Äôt breathe There‚Äôs also people going hospitals they‚Äôre afraid contracting Covid, people getting routine checkups, people going dentist, people literally getting turned away hospitals issue nothing Covid. see happening know hurt us, aren‚Äôt anything fucking stop it? sure downvoted. correct. 

Putting faith either side operating government solve problems false dichotomy. 

There many problems many solutions, end day, they're handled humans. 

Fallible, predictable humans. 

Humans bought money votes blackmailed controlled.

The sooner put Artificial General Intelligence control better. Either beautiful utopia problems solved everyone happy robots nuke us everyone ~~dead~~ happy. thank god arent doctor Yes.

We made stupid mistake telling people wife living, used giving random rashes community playground.

But different, could help preventative medicine, hoping past years would given family rapport came medical advice, keeping neighbors healthy would less patients small hospital wife works.

But people wouldn‚Äôt listen. feel bad them, even everything else taken care of, there‚Äôs treatments house (one loon told doorbell knew HCQ, don‚Äôt, asked wife getting back seemed safe said safe pointless), poor woman already worn months high stakes ever changing medicine there‚Äôs way I‚Äôd anyone closest friends getting telephone consult.

I‚Äôve since put list door along note aren‚Äôt taking solicitation due CoVID19. Wonder helps. mental test anything last 8 months now. I'm living circumstances I'm far used enjoy tell much worse could been, especially replayed Fallout 3 back April. 

All wait. I'm trying make sure survive see hobbies like travel again. want see others survive too. make sound like big deal people nervous taking it.  take vaccines scared Covid, sure going wait months see goes first wave two. 

This would fastest vaccine ever market fair amount (as understand it). skipping whole shit ton testing. LOT quitting. Like 700 strike. Tbh, I‚Äôd refuse help anyone A- went party B- unmasked outside. Kids, babies, teens unmasked dick parents, old people... I‚Äôd serve them. No, vaccines require one dose (Johnson &amp; Johnson ex). Think others requiring two-part innoculation.

We need get vaccinated every year flu flu changes rapidly. far, appears virus not. 

In scenario would need vaccinated often year. here. considering bringing brother's family 4, parents, wife's mother sister. That's top daughter returning college works public facing job. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Three folks (my parents hers) vulnerable sure. assume virus would kill them..

Except last, none rest invited point. I‚Äôd still take China. LOT quitting. Like 700 strike. Tbh, I‚Äôd refuse help anyone A- went party B- unmasked outside. Kids, babies, teens unmasked cunt parents, old people... I‚Äôd serve them. Can‚Äôt win don‚Äôt play! show vastly different states responses pandemics, fucked federal system kept telling us open absolutely get stomped care. states great job place got overwhelmed rural communities heavily protected. Many remote aboriginal ones put complete isolation orders.

QLD WA far absolute best responses IMO. *Americans, people general I‚Äôm surprised comment got downvoted quickly. Like yeah, China probably succesfull lowering cases, questionable practices, welding doors shut, arresting journalists questioned methods make ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù. many people lost jobs forced lockdowns left devices. 
Also, I‚Äôm saying case numbers presented China wrong would usually take numbers authoritarian state grain salt. SpaceX studying coronavirus Good shit america. Can't wait extend way 2021 now. Finally got elderly parents agree stay home Thanksgiving, call yesterday they're way airport pick friend returned traveling god-knows-where. *sigh* give huge amount sociopaths country much credit change based press do.

They changed minds gun laws, despite fact mass killings time. reason happening virus kills more. people die lack social interactions. Masks one element multi-tiered approach. Anti-maskers bane society. Australia sent armed troops instead, like better?

Also, fun fact, ICU, also allowed out, ""the pit"", coming rest life. group met ""no mask shopping"" act defiance event walmart. discourage people wear mask, **but also encourage people, want to, take mask off**,"" said Forsman. ""Don't afraid live life. afraid go house, think going die, probably already dead inside, know. So, get live life. Life taking chances, opportunities--you never know what's going happen."" [no mask shitty hill die on...muh freedom, muh right fuck everyone else encounter ""to feel alive"". Probably 6 months after.

Emergency workers, staff, vulnerable populations elderly first honestly likely infected people cueing get on/off plane. Nice example toxic positivity. powers need stop blowing smoke everyone's ass. They've telling end us sight since whole thing started. Meanwhile half million Americans going dead Covid come May. oppozzed ze white von make grab sniff ze ladiez pubiz, yez. Every state behaving well except Hawaii. point, Hawaii secede use traditional Native Hawaiian monarchy form government. Western Civ American government nothing disastrous there. Seriously lmao mean happened within states too. Portland, locked everyone work/teleworking immediately drove coast, could buy food home goods, also potentially infect people small coastal tourist towns maybe 1 ICU bed whole community. Warrenton (population like 5k) declare state emergency, ban camping short-term rentals, basically kick morons think would done better shunned shamed reckless people openly instead giving thoughts prayers. 

But that's none business, apparently. it‚Äôs important. That‚Äôs asking trouble. Worked Victoria, Australia. go normal lives, sport events, BBQs hugging etc. Took 3 months discipline... amazing become complacent never good taking preventative actions begin with, large number us believe holy water incense. People crazy. million Americans flew planes yesterday. Gonna brutal Christmas, gonna brutal winter.

I saw movie week called Outpost. ""Bodies attract bodies"" kept saying people got hit. wanted save people, would get killed. did. Bodies attract bodies. People can't help social ape like. learned lot people year. Oceana always war east Asia thought too, think set population will. 

My mom lives one small rural counties Kansas follow mask mandate. alright awhile, things really ramped there. Gov Kelly issued second mask mandate, mom saw people wearing masks suddenly start wearing them. people need laws follow, dumb common sense. I‚Äôd move. Florida epicenter zombie virus, Mark words. need lockdown Christmas too. Possibly christmas 2021. disagree science fellow human Yes get that, laws put place enforced huge portion population knowingly want comply dangerous. mention strained courts, jails, prisons, emergency workers right now.

Covid regulations put place really come people choosing comply. people politicized health guidelines invoked personal freedom amendments beyond me, know shop owner cop risk ass enforce it. haven‚Äôt seen situation addressed news articles. feel feel free travel enjoy family haven‚Äôt seen guidance. Yep. New Years. 

People suck. don‚Äôt let minors board. one making decision board cruise ship right someone else. That""s less 5% gyms lol. selfish generation date (my parents born 49 54.) Literally everything handed them. majority keep marriage together save lives, to, ""spread wings,"" whatever self-help bullshit lapped gallon.

Sure, worked hard, parents worked factory jobs, mother built trucks line 32 years. could, however, exist thrive high school diploma, even, jobs paid. Pensions actual thing existed. Job protection existed. Mortgage rates high 80's $50,000 house came they? 5-10 years high rate economy booming, tech taking off. eluding opposite generation encountered, called hope.

My grandparents grew little save mindset children would never see life way. created generation defective, holier thou brats agenda 2020 continue pass buck awful decisions.

Obsolescence purgatory. Enjoy yours. left Army 06 wish young enough go back, Military looking real good right Ooooh, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool  probably health care workers first. elderly/at risk imagine. Thots playerz it? many people already died seem get it'll christmas we'll due another 1 month remindme :( Brilliant! not?  would thought general public? gain access first dose? vaccine 90 percent efficacy rate theres 1 10 chance immune even vaccinated mom, whose elderly retirement, who's moved back live here. We've done spread virus. can't travel, can't see family lives different country, losing entire year likely enjoying time left selfish people can't fucking control themselves.

But people like bad, wishing death upon region people disassociated enough see ""others"" non-human. Fuck you. Commons

This shit debunked awhile ago, politicians used spread austerity. tragedy population deliberately taught ignorant corporations. Wow, don‚Äôt even know is! (Can explain briefly?) hear everyone wore masked virus would eliminated, look places like Europe, fuck social distancing wear mask bro /s  solution measures working measures, right? Check yourself, bad. im middle aged.

Flu kills millions every year, infirm. Keep safe, otherwise shut up. think troll accounts? You‚Äôre probably right.   I‚Äôm nurse say time ‚Äòhero‚Äô platitudes extended every person goes work potentially exposed. I‚Äôm job, everyone else can‚Äôt afford quit. Without cashiers grocery store, fed ex ups, etc would fucked. 

If want thank me, put mask. Since we'd still practicing precautions outside hanging out

the risky point assuming everyone always take right precautions, vaccine effectiveness. ""precautions"" reduce risk, 100% prevent virus. could everything right still infect other, probably everything right either. many areas opinion humane varies wildly. opinions open discussion. care great deal look selfies.  last stimulus money?

I'm particularly disappointed people's lack creativity this. in-laws love cook. love cook Thanksgiving. they're also intelligent enough know gathering happening. mother law cooking main dishes grandma cooking sides. portioned family, placed to-go bag, handed porch. We're invited say hello door take dinner home, farther away family later zoom dinner. cousin planning taking lots pictures kids write email grandparents pictures. in-laws get cook, everyone gets eat, stay safe. 

Maybe come immigrant family, I'm used masses relatives around holidays. grandparents always families though, intricate Christmas cards, long letters, phone calls. grandma's sister would send recipes months advance, would make Christmas dinner write long letters went, complete two dozen family photos holiday.  place save them. point responsibility. worried it, don‚Äôt go there. Simple China, billions. 1.3 billion people need eat unreasonable think billions packages food entering country weekly. thankful FDA operate Health Canada's pace.

Um ... yeah. think specifically said ‚Äúexcept people‚Äù aren‚Äôt able adequately protect themselves? Lol sLaMs covid supporters? Sometimes wonder margin error considering polls. Also, hell development increase cases/hospitalizations/deaths, ""election surprise"" vaccine, good news effectiveness two front-runner vaccines, cause people skip getting inoculated? logic escapes me.

I feel like maintaining intense restrictions vaccines become widely available opposed legally going anti-vaxxers catering them.  goes... 3 day ban? Big deal. permanently banning like many subs days. Yeah, hold breath. He's president-elect now, there's zero reasons remember promised. ask, evil Republicans blocking it. Keep voting blue, day now, student loans forgiven. 

It's red side: abortion still legal, matter US president wannabes promised election.

In eyes politician, worthless scum, tell right lies enough show vote them. Successful mitigation new cases deaths skyrocketing? I'm sorry seeing it. dancing rain. Keep dancing rains. Yeah even crowded outdoor bars problematic. I‚Äôm meaning rag you, frustrated general. China decrease population hundred million, would need import food. wasn‚Äôt defending anyone. replying you, dumbass.

My point workers aren‚Äôt making voluntary ‚Äúchoice‚Äù go work increase risk spread. essentially forced work survive, US, unlike developed countries, provide social safety net people stay home. US provide funding safety guidance businesses reduce risk workers customers.  timing. Covid Tracking project calculates numbers around 5:00 P.M. Eastern that's (they go back make changes).

My friends talk much anymore either. still follow safety measures, get wrong, anything say another iteration we've saying what? 8 months now? draining repetition. I‚Äôve felt way since May/June. kinds ""New World Order"" conspiracies often shit concocted 90s eternally stuck period

Eh, think empathy collectivism helped. Latin America values empathy, compassion, collectivism done bad worse Western culture. fact, Middle Eastern culture collectivist done poorly.

I think values helped East Asia are: putting high IQ people pedestal, putting introverts pedestal, conscientiousness, valuing math/science religion.

In fact religion thing probably really important. Western Civ hobbled mostly fundie Christianity. Latin America fundie Catholicism. Middle East fundie Islam. Lots especially stupid people USA. cruises running, probably sold out. makes sad. article says terminal poorly. done almost certainly done compassion. doctor legally bound continue suffering, not, go prison.

Unfortunately similar measures would never enacted US. Pretty much staffing issue. Sure easily set many field hospitals possible(providing funds) unless adequately staff pretty much pointless. run hospital capacity likely extra staff available alot extra field hospitals. big, powerful, needs financial support, please reach bank account send us much can, remember....he's watching..... authoritarian government militarized police state routinely murders American citizens, already happens.

15 one exposure event implies R0 high higher measles. would also jive WH outbreak.

Please realize uneveness spread ( low K ) combined high R0 results typically reported average R0 3-6.

Gawd mutation lengthened infectious window would terrible. hate reading stories like this. Really glad everyone recovered.

This virus sucks insulting nimrod even mention white rose society.

I swear deserve everything get. sickens happening. someone risk, prison systems something. no, bare minimum infected people already punished. doesnt matter prisoner did, still treated like human beings. what's point post ""show sweden alligning rest us morons""? similar issue back march travel 7 different stores toilet paper. odd reason people think toilet paper stocking virus makes shit often guilt doesn‚Äôt anyone good.

#Murica though? wife (Girlfriend time) mom two college-going sisters dependents. got base 1200... man place seen people talking herd immunity here, nowhere else. non friends, non professors, one iv talked Sweden idk wtf talking about. im quoting senior vice president Pfizer said. purchase deal vaccine ready. accept BARDA funding vaccine. Shut virus care . adults take risks . could members public vaccinated end 2020, virus truly knew January. Nuts fewer meth gators humans go extinct, account lack meth supply?  people would rather spend last Thanksgiving ever family. I‚Äôm willing bet large amount elderly people would rather spend last theoretic year family locked away home last good years left planet. Elderly people know day could last (COVID not), it‚Äôs risk they‚Äôre willing take. 

On hand, wouldn‚Äôt make people feel guilty don‚Äôt want take risk. want not, I‚Äôm going make feel guilty either way. much easier block EU traffic comply way.

So gather again

No one missing get it.

If people selfish, go beyond protect themselves? 

Like wearing mask would protect you, obviously protect Disgusting went top school well, I'm pretty sure Name Brand University got resume pulled pile one interview. tough times like this. 2,000 billionaires world collective net worth $8 trillion. WFP needs $4.9 billion one year keep 30 million people dying. one feels bit optimistic? 

It's gonna least mid- late-December Pfizer Moderna get approval, least months get first groups vaccinated, mention two doses month apart every single one millions people. 

Then comes logistical nightmare getting larger population general, transporting everywhere, proper storage (especially Pfizer needs kept frozen), fighting anti-vax nonsense. 

Maybe me, next summer fall realistic? many Americans trash. countries sense responsibility others taken believing nonsense. Pretty sure talking rising sea levels Le sigh. Wisconsin, people absolutely arguing DUIs fines, never lose license. pushed Tavern League Wisconsin. Tavern League bringing lawsuits cancel covid health measures state. thing. 0.1% chance dying coronavirus

Incorrect. Source?

Also, that's even point, point spread people die it. selfish prick wear fucking mask hard. Halloween work governor fucking evil person.   Pretty sure talking rising sea levels plenty people special kind stupid. wear damn piece cloth face, I'm asking amish. type thinking smoothbrains have, slippery slope use excuse discomfort even smallest way. Sometimes adding extrinsic motivator (like cash incentive) actually opposite effect. imagine would make anti vaxxers even suspicious  Quick question. someone Covid around August get December? Fuck saying let virus rip population fingers crossed vaccine would made quickly.

This information encouraging relaxed approach virus eats away US. estimate many Americans might truly infected far (not reported positive cases) You‚Äôre welcome x) actually wrong too.

I need TP bunghole! lots states took measures though. read article reminded something wise said late outspoken Tom Metzger blatant misinformation. People are, fact, dropping dead... Good. short term risk death serious injury known. Correct. low young people.

The long term risk, hand, unknown. disregard people's rights wishes

You seem insight happened others don't? Minks cute least won‚Äôt need vaccine. hope gets voted first responders evaluate personal basis, risk take next upcoming months. system designed exposed individuals working common good covid sadly, disposable. Sounds like Florida turn blue next year. Trump followers die COVID. Testing captures moment time. get infect leaving testing facility. Test walk contract virus. captures moment time. isn‚Äôt theory. It‚Äôs scientific fact. Testing doesn‚Äôt make immune. can‚Äôt predict future events. It‚Äôs moment time.

A junkie get blood test Hepatitis C waiting results share needles friend infected. test results would negative testing sample processed prior recent exposure.

I took saliva swab Wednesday came back negative. However, didn‚Äôt cough hard 3 times right test coughing line.

Also cough infrequent nothing like flu.

On Friday took test coughed came back negative.

Does sound like I‚Äôm fine ? worked Tuesday Friday mostly stayed office rarely around group people Bruh. What? That‚Äôs literal fucking quote man worked Fauci.

EPA Link topic: seriously think IHME banned sub.

It's completely unreliable source: give (admittedly extreme) example messed be, predicted 120k deaths Japan couple months ago, two weeks later, revised predictions 90%. get optimism sub, I'll offer realistic perspective. point taking articles seriously. would thought back December 2019 Coronavirus would descend upon humanity March 2020? really know future holds. may see negativity, not. Especially since Covid-Mink virus spreading globally Remeber first said ""ASymptomatic people far less likely spread covid""

Welp... absolutely mistake still done work ending community transmission. task. reducing hospitals saturation levels. closing gyms four weeks calling day. Stopping community transmission work. either done not.

There's need cases restrictions 10 months. simply question what's necessary end community transmission keeping track cases make sure outbreaks occur squashed do. 

The countries done living less normally. countries perpetually stop working work done ones leave virus running rampant, always verge overwhelming them. Good god Sacramento sheriff Sacramento police refuse enforce? That's state fucking capital, Governor lives, makes announcements shit. anarchy. cops completely ignoring civil government right front them. No, soaring misinformation. 

Fuck off. Facts need come first philosophical political BS. sub depends facts presenting right information. bikes giant front wheel. That's funny. Six months ago would good time.

P.S. moron Trant.  sounds really good People hold accountable.
Truth ONE WANTS WEAR MASK it‚Äôs matter prioritizing safety ones feelings well accepting temporary. Would wayyyyyy shorter lived everyone complied.....
However never late. #safetyfirst point (and within parameters) determine modern day America handled pandemic worse country century ago? anyone know would work like that?

People get actual virus usually start developing antibodies week two exposure. would long delay using vaccine? wish could properly detect text. caught slight hint sure read comment confirming it.

I‚Äôm surprised see record daily new cases Saturday. Opting option probably great healer men want touch infected.
There's even story bible you, kind bigotry apparently old time. state issued car insurance order theft order homicide order decided opt out. Many countries already cap healthcare costs, unfortunately COVID shown even mercy international pharma corporations.  Facts. even Rockets 2 MVP's can't get past second round author heavily biased. Twitter feed dumpster fire anti-COVID-19 memes retweets. over-80 IFR dropped around 25% 11%, assumes hospitals conducting triage, looks like they're going pretty soon based crowds Airports weekend. I've started going early mornings though avoid crowds planning ahead one day hard enough, idk think might actually good diet. Pizza wings sound nearly good 7am 3pm lol. Even socialistic societies people critical society (Healthcare, utilities, agriculture, logistics etc) still treated like cogs wheel. sucks US, can‚Äôt imagine feeling better socialist nation. hardest workers, shouldering biggest risk gets shortest end stick. sad way around. Yeah, simply reality. Schools shouldn‚Äôt child care facilities, they, reality, are. also real component provide cost extremely low cost food kids. terribly sad reality silver lining comes hope realize screwed stuff is. decades schools wrongly become child care facilities well centers low cost food, etc. closing plan whatsoever devastating. talking about? Could site sources? Santa Claus metaphor something? Mmmmm Santa Brains Yes agree Well That's retirement age pay teachers. starting course. Family trying make wife feel guilty attempting protect ourselves, people work with, livelihood. fuck off. Best thing thankful year left alive, stay away other, keep way. many uncounted positives now? real infection count 5, 10, 15 million? Using exponential growth. Number cases matter false-positive dangerous maybe even less dangerous ordinary flu. 

Only people severe health issues old people died Covid19 healthy young people. Sweden 62 deaths per 100,000. 

Finland 7 deaths per 100,000. 

Sweden population 10 million.

Finland population 5 million.

The population Sweden double Finland, death rate nearly 9 times that. 

You're searching excuses. inert protein, provide something immune system react to. dangerous unless someone allergy another ingredient. worst happen take effect. Uhh.. manners compared americans. brand rule certainly problems, admit single ruling party able quickly effectively deal pandemic major plus. take Trazadone sleep aid, causes vivid detailed dreams works well med makes poor antidepressant originally. take empty stomach. much melatonin causes sleep paralysis. Agreed, hasn‚Äôt thing? forget Cowboys. Mike McCarthy supposed modernized old ways. Yes, lost Dak, one best group skill-position players still struggling put points. One family friends friend facebook. said: really starting think masks useless. people know covid, majority constant mask wearers.""

When pressed explanation, bowling last night, watching people constantly touch face. Everytime get up, put mask on. Everytime sit down, take off. bowl, pull mask down. care anyone says, wear mask, touch face more"".

Seriously? That's like saying ""Condoms work. Everyone know kids wears condom time"" adding ""they keep taking putting middle sex"" takeaway ""people getting pregnant wearing condom makes touch more"". North Dakota probably best example area low density really bad infection/death rate.   Funny 75 years ago nobody would think going Germans help... Translation: Hospitals tent parking lot die in. think I'd slap /s ok. Also types people get covid die. sure spread others die. Oh they'll fine. probably good immune systems decades needlessly exposing germs due poor hygiene. problem they'll become superspreaders get people sick. can't control anyone else ourselves. end day, answer person mirror.

When over, I'll know kept safe reason anyone else died.

I'll proud that. true. well america kind bottleneck. basically private manufacture private distribution. govt involved planning. can't wait see it! ""Everything bigger Texas"" always good thing. People die time gonna die end. That's part life.

And odds covid one cut life short. fucking airborne Ebola. plural ""anecdote"" ""data"" Props sources. habit wish people had. Now, said, ""in UK..."", sources would sufficient. Unfortunately, sources enough support claim ""in democracies"".  Cause it‚Äôs MERICA BITCHES, DONT GIVE FUCK!! They‚Äôve many experts come endorse safety vaccine. They‚Äôve done three phases trials. I‚Äôm genuinely curious could do? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre going ‚Äú ü§ñ yes. safe‚Äù they‚Äôve lined science created literally paused trials *any* indication unsafe sides Seasonality little effect.

The massive winter spike we're begs differ.

The fact r0 go 1.0 summertime seasonality sufficient eliminate summertime epidemic, mean also much higher now.  That's like 13,000 week. vaccines arrive late make difference. US probably infected February/March. target audience FEE's content Americans.

They aim hold example people lack critical thinking skills.

The US, states compared Sweden even Norway Finland's geography population density. 

And even places might theoretically demographically similar comparison... major difference Sweden US outgoing political leader US appear give shit actually providing leadership reduce cases. keeps giving joy reality shows following individuals diagnosis eventual outcome, warts all?

Maybe video grandma fighting breath, eventually dying family unable near might drive point home significant percentage US population unable show empathy TV. like virus would spread full speed hit magic ""herd immunity"" number.

Something like 30 40% immunity would *massive* effect R number (i.e. would reduced 30-40%). combined even basic social distancing measures, 50% immunity would easily bring well 1.

For sake comparison, European countries more-or-less open (with mask-wearing) weeks ago R really get 1.5 despite 10% antibodies.

Additionally, vaccinating majority old people would prevent deaths even virus *was* spreading full speed. Uuuugh lol Im nit going yo argue people minimum wage jobs deserve living wage (because do) 
But everyone elses pay needs go too. Nobody's pay kept inflation. shame heslthcare workers go school 2-8 years, person training finally eork take good care Citizens listen guidelines don‚Äôt get covid able sue plague spreaders damages. Literally seize assets. ""a bit misleading"", that's polite here. something complete bullshit blatant lie numbers post.

About 30% ICU places free, Covid patients 20% taken beds, good possibility upscaling them.

Also headline ""European countries believed"", severely doubt country neighboring Germany actually plans using spare capacity Germany, everything fine, article implies.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah sure. position trumpism still. Uh lot places shut fucked response virus horribly wearing masks, huge protests rallies, casting doubt legitimacy issue. done needed earlier wouldn‚Äôt shut again. need someone government telling responsible? turn let stomp side face? every one anti-maskers Covid deniers forced sign agreement giving right treatment. real, what's harm. 

As soon get sick police lock house since real, they'll fine. isn‚Äôt surprising all. exactly outcome country prioritizes wealth health. Short term inconvenience long term gain exact formula need healthy outcome. However, exact opposite want economy. Early pandemic could clearly see priority given narrative ‚Äú*should*‚Äù lock vs *must* save economy. current situation result decision making. Health, especially mental health, cannot prioritized goal requires working spending lord us all. Ah okay, yeah, asking first reason lol. really going ""why still pandemic"" angle. used go grocery shopping times week preferred grocery store busy time there's lines everywhere huge pain try limit every 1-2 weeks. toilet paper selling again? Ok instead death get death? Interesting.  western nation seen relax restrictions quickly Australia. 

They second wave, even isolated one state. 

At peak, 700 daily cases. went hard lockdown set target 5 daily cases average (sustained 2 weeks). 

When figure cross threshold delayed reopening couple days potential source outbreak needed dealt with.

Now state gone three weeks since it‚Äôs last recorded case, one active case currently remains.

The nation whole didn‚Äôt fuck around comes virus. Borders still closed non-citizens hotel quarantine programme instead self-quarantine.

Just couple days ago, another state shut completely recorded 20 cases single day. non-essential businesses (including takeaway deliveries) shut you‚Äôre prohibited leaving house. feelings functioning memory. stop. die ""its none fucking business"" hill subject. Exactly! Nunavut territory Canada went largest sovereign COVID free place worse provinces contain densest cities week. Still quite sure happened given roads territory roads populated areas. 14 day quarantine fairly easy enforce given fly boat only.  Yeah numbers going 2 weeks. strange say ""already reached peak"" peak high. Boy, ever anyone Greenland fence ‚Äúsold‚Äù US, 2020 would bumped right onto ‚Äúnever!‚Äù side.  Best luck. pulse oximeter monitor oxygen levels? goes finger tip. actual decision say whether actually safe EUA hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Doesn‚Äôt matter experts endorse point. Imagine taken tests China back March actually traveller's test flights. I'm sure that's effective spreader  neither reliable become infected test (which could happened here).

I know going want nitpick, but.. infected, get negative test symptoms, start displaying flight. likely. Think Hope case McDonald supposedly got infected. tested negative boarding plane, started showing symptoms air. Agreed. Four times less likely means negative three times likely. One time less likely means zero likelihood. Insanity =  
Doing thing again... expecting different result. üòî

A lot innocent people going die direct result entitled individuals selfishly choose travel HEIGHT global pandemic! I'm saying people read studies like back spring immediately started taking 10k IU daily something crazy like recommendation 1000 IU children &lt;1 year enriched formula 1500 IU breastfed children older 6 months, 3000 IU children year age, around 8000 IU young adults thereafter.

And secret China messed beginning censorship although recovered really well Get tested safe 5% mortality rate would probably killed fewer people outside China *maybe* Western Europe New York.

The thing makes virus huge global health threat death rate low enough sizeable number people take seriously governments prioritise economy eradication virus.

With 5% death rate, seen absolutely mind-boggling deaths early on, followed much stricter lockdowns governments much widespread compliance public. There'd ""it's flu bro"" 5% IFR scenario (at least enough relevant). Um, sure, ""jealous"". Let's say thanks together go home die!  Yeah. Except said okay back then. /s American, worked several years USA. actually really sad situation IMO - Americans bothered school shootings / mass shootings, reform held hostage gun lobby, there's sizeable chunk Americans gun fanatics. while, majority Americans throw hands give making meaningful progress.

It's thing pandemic - similar subset population opposes gun reform opposed public health measures sabotaged meaningful progress, time, Americans collectively gave well.

There truly regressive segment America continuously holds country back sorts issues. surprisingly, many embody worst stereotypes world Americans bar low right Hollywood, see big screen adaptation coming holiday season 2023. Didn‚Äôt know usually took long. see three week period absolute win, long nothing goes wrong reviewing! I‚Äôm sure that. would assume age requirements don‚Äôt know it. Well, break leg skateboarding call ambulance, aren‚Äôt any, limp clinic doctor patch up, aren‚Äôt any, lie floor bleeding dying, say ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù? traveled Washington state Arizona got ill there. went urgent care test negative. felt worse went er wasnt sick enough released PCR. scheduled fly back results would back chose drive instead. husband wasnt happy refused article reddit. PCR negative ultimately really pneumonia way they'd let plane hacking like was. let's pretend 80@ 330 million 264 million people infected infections give robust immunity (a BIG if). 

So even give - would mean 4 5 million dead americans. 

happy? first gold! Thank kind stranger. Excerpt: mask mandate issued Kansas governor summer facilitated decrease coronavirus cases, report published Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) Friday found.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's work, sure. anyone else defend must work way?

What want hear informed person explain data submission could pass authorization hypothetical three-day review yet found suggest substantial net harm three-week review. way shorter review process could end significant mistake.

Devil's advocating extremely unlikely possibilities:

(1) Maybe vaccine severe long-term side effects appear months years now.

(2) Maybe 20,000 vaccinated trial participants lucky, collected data 20,000 we'd find several die unexplained illness vaccination. (The higher number deaths, vanishingly unlikely is.)

(3) Maybe vaccine immediate side effects rare mild FDA could miss three-day review, rare mild elude three-week review.

Case 1 disastrous error, can't averted slightly longer review existing data.

Case 2 worst minor error since current safety record already proves vaccine safer Covid (at least vulnerable populations first line vaccinated). Case 2 again, longer review existing data change anything.

Case 3 error all. Nobody cares extended review finds vaccine induced (say) 10 minutes hiccuping 1 5,000 patients. Authorization would still correct decision. address completely missed point That's like saying someone else responsible poisoning food still eating poisoned food.

Just someone else root issue mean ignore it, that's stupid. AWESOME! good news. WOOT WOOT! Exactly. enough Exactly. Since start pandemic it‚Äôs given wouldn‚Äôt go home visit pandemic (no matter long takes). get covid point test. Potentially anywhere. plane, taxi, hotel. China authoritarian rest world NOWHERE CLOSE switching rmb reserve currency China drive global economy. 

China making world‚Äôs cheap shit. It‚Äôs going birth, growth, maturity process many countries have. 

It massive middle class. that‚Äôll translate global economy remains seen. But, population definitely spending emerging. 

My point still stands though. I‚Äôm saying Muhammad Ali greatest right whether like you‚Äôre saying 10 year old kid named Mike Tyson kinda fight. (Terrible analogy possibly don‚Äôt think timeline correct point stands)...maybe he‚Äôll great, maybe he‚Äôll get shot drive Cus doesn‚Äôt take wing. 

But RIGHT USA economy still fattest kid, lot. 22, 20202

man shit still around 18,000 years might well top pandemic, people licking door knobs toilets crying loud.

Taiwan never declared independence.
It UN member.
Only 15 states world recognises it.

Taiwan island part China, ROC declare Taiwan independent, claims ruler China itself. 

This distinction needs made covid-19 measures consistent Chinese provinces also experienced numerous cases low death counts. Taiwan country would produced worst results would look like Australia 900 deaths. Yes it.  made edit. Unborn children literally alive.

As thought it. People known months Thanksgiving go (in terms people outside household) period. That's really good analogy. describes feel. Agreed. study study (ref 1 link CDC guidance posted article) suggest asymptomatic people transmit virus. I'm virologist, may likely lower viral loads. CDC recommends 14-day quarantine, 97.5% people contracted covid exhibiting symptoms within 11.5 days exposure. make two weeks without symptoms, roommates probably fine.

Asymptomatic people transmit Figure 1A. Also, look Nature paper posted above.

97.5% presymptomatic (vs asymptomatic) exhibiting symptoms within 11.5 days

CDC guidance: based upon: luck, stay safe. Fatality rate coronavirus: &lt;1%

Do contains penalties language police use make arrest violating them?

If not, police hamstrung, trying proactively save public beating saying able and/or going do.

A ""simple"" fix would Governor legislators, add language orders spells violation misdemeanor even felony crime result fines $$ jail time XX. police something work chargeable arrestable offence, enforce things, using tickets arrests, people comply legal order.

Most Health Department issues seem become Police Department issue actual Health Officer involved, prevented carrying legal mandate(s), issue becomes something allowing Health Officer carrying legal duties, tends become disorderly conduct charge/arrest.

But see/understand things, takes something like cause action become something police enforce.

Just telling people stay home streets, without enforcement power attached it, request, puts police bad spot. 

Arresting someone disorderly conduct committing crime reasonable belief crime committed, tends end costing police force city/govt work big $$$ goes court false arrest, imprisonment like.

I hope California gets things control, looking like going taking back #1 position Texas COVID-19 cases. Definitely kind #1 one tends want associated with.

Do keep mind I'm lay person, who's lawyer cop, could full totally wrong.

it's problem sub, reddit.  85 percent am. :( mean rate spread slow soon, right? Sweden low number daily deaths. guys need walk out. Yes, those, will
Always there.

[crickets] Yes. exactly groundbreaking stuff, done elsewhere months ago multiple browse thread every day yet see science lockdown denier today. Maybe someone thinks situation shitty that‚Äôs source bullshit right wing.

It cherry picks evidence suit point.

The reality right Sweden forced implement stricter measures due rising deaths cases. definitely get feeling couple, maybe more, people sub don‚Äôt want pandemic end. read stories posted DR Fauci says couple rough months people praise say he‚Äôs following science. next day story posted Fauci says back normal spring 2021 people say he‚Äôs idiot doubt he‚Äôs saying. controlled Trump. still are, unfortunately.

And want complain Chinese people eating wild animals (not farmed), pretty much everyone earth fault.

Africans still hunt eat wild game.

Australia serves kangaroo, emu croc meat.

USA participates eating roadkill bats.

Europeans eat actually rotten decomposing sharks, fish cheese (which pretty weird food begin with).

Unfortunately, seem uptick last week so. shocking, stuff moving really fast. Peer reviewed data released yet. still questions potential long term side effects.

Fact average person able get vaccine till around March. Plenty time gather see data, personal ancedotal info side effects.

Still personally little skeptical (fortunate youth, job overall situation). still probably waiting till least March (realistically might available). course offered time earlier would consider well.  Unfortunately, we're unwilling learn *any* countries managed virus successfully, including limited China. Rich nations, poor nations, island nations, landlocked nations, dense nations, sparse nations... we're interested.

The word reporter looking ""denies"". Bill Gates denies conspiracy theory. entirely agree, that's (to mind) one top 3 issues society/government/humanity needs sort out.

But earned money honestly (broad strokes), he's one billionaires actively giving away much can, he's actively invested society.

What top two leading causes death right now? Probably heart disease diabetes condition like that. freaking obesity rates, starting *war carbs*? resources money we‚Äôre spending covid due lost economic output, vaccines, etc. probably could saved 5x amount lives subsidizing gym memberships healthier expensive food. 

Again, half deaths covid occurring nursing homes, people explicitly placed soon die anyway. majority half death *with* covid, covid, knows many explicitly due covid.

Whether local store hiring separate issue. shopping near closing/after 8pm really limits options. lots stuff purchased restocked 12/1pm next day. least that's grocery store. Huh. idea. I‚Äôve back napkin math using lot variables.

You know also use google trends spot areas (states cities) going pop cases weeks month ahead time? 

Add three search: Covid testing, Covid symptoms, Covid test.

Play around timelines, locations, etc. like follow document past 7 day search keep track spot trends areas move charts know areas going become hot weeks ‚Äî areas experiencing huge virus spread.

Granted, much easier beginning couple months ago... data getting kinda jumbled it‚Äôs spreading place right now.

I tell northeast going seriously pop cases next weeks. Search volume really moving testing.

Hawaii search spikes, too.

But see it‚Äôs spreading right local level - choose state... past day... see areas people looking testing symptoms They're employees, slaves. Hospital administration governments need fix this. Ah yes, like Leningrad 1942! enjoyment: german vs languages Wow people cult. ended relationship due virus, young female poses virtually danger you. society doomed current generation scared nothing. said anything outraged? I‚Äôm merely acknowledging view numbers different perspective quite surprising. 
And, correct I‚Äôm wrong, citing worldwide TB deaths comparison figure US COVID deaths alone. we‚Äôre comparing apples apples, 2.5 planes (515 people) full TB cases crashed U.S. last year. people able buy fake negative test difference really make? Christmas well probably herd immunity 1% population ground. remember seeing inauguration events 2016. totally antsy bored-looking. Could pay attention anyone else talking.  ‚ÄúJoe Biden usher era communism degeneracy‚Äù

It‚Äôs it‚Äôs easier parent. take kid school pick up, go vacations different parts state virtual learning anywhere, kid free time, etc. reasons share shameful parent. 

So, shut bar restaurants school? benefit stopping stupid patrons congregate It‚Äôs less trickle effect. Shutting bar restaurant, tragic employees bar restaurant, simply impacts less people. Closing one school impoverished area parents work impacts potentially hundreds people make decision literally eating roof head child‚Äôs education/safety (I say safety can‚Äôt exactly leave 7 8 year old home alone). found fascinating schools county announced going virtual many parents happy end August.

Logically, school closed, don‚Äôt need non-teaching staff. outrage, however, tremendous. get it, able compensate people. can‚Äôt compensate landscapers can‚Äôt stop working keep kids home nurses, grocery store employees, waitresses, tremendous list jobs, compensate non-teaching school employees?

Just like anything else world make choice two bad decisions imperative full understanding reaching consequences decisions prior blindly making decisions. found going grocery stores open 5AM also good. Often one there. Australia doesn‚Äôt 340 million people. majority Australia outback Despite nothing still running ICU beds, least way european countries, despite reddits constant socialism trolling US healthcare system actually pretty good. hope makes feel good life.

So far though, that's store that's said anything here. I've even looked buying cart(an actual grocery cart, granny looking things) speed things even make cleanable. Honestly understand this....people (Americans) sick living restrictions. 

It one thing ""just two three weeks"" back March. November.

At least credible vaccines immediate horizon....that's *incredible* progress! I‚Äôd say so. COVID still around threat right stay work hard enough billionaire! make college free limit voting people 4 year degrees. I'm going sympathy willingly spread disease pandemic. I? cracking assuming ceo instacart global elite

he's immigrant created something provides work hundreds thousands people would otherwise un underemployed Almost 2 years u consider vaccine rollouts slow. Absolutely ridiculous inhumane.    That's thing, ignorant selfish people.

German experience, ""bad""

My daughter (16) tested positive placed quarantine. 

She got ""official order"" CDC. gave us K-1 contacts. (Wife+me) drove day test 7 hours, considered positive also.

We tried contact ""CDC"" (Gesundheitsamt) report properly, almost impossible reach them. informed contacts (5) extremely carefull. able keep count low since work home office since march, happened vacation)


We managed get test week (negative) daughters quarantine officially ended 10 days... finally got order quarantine day got negative results. 

Finally managed contact CDC got dates sorted out.

The bright thing able tease wife mentioning prolonged quarantine :D

Ohhh... fines breaking 500-10000‚Ç¨, yes needed official paperwork papers issued CDC local town government (And hardly reach either, cant anything without part giving confirmation written ... See: )

Imagine talking DMV need IRS papers normally handed out... Democrats want win Georgia use working class arguments, demand working class armed organized. oligarch overlords grooming propaganda offering true solutions slaves' lives never mattered, anyway. Went Lowes earlier saw. Lot people wearing mask. Young, old, even one employees. sucks student right now, many reasons. big one right lot us really much choice flying home Thanksgiving. school ended semester Thanksgiving (so return afterward January) puts every student position ""You go home can't stay here."" option fly halfway across country Thanksgiving, wear mask, touch anything. 

I'm justifying 50 million traveling Americans pains knowing I'm one statistics although reasonable solutions. lot colleges condensed semesters right now, means legitimate break since August compensate shortened semesters. Lack break, spending half weekends making lost class time, seeing family 4 1/2 months, takes LOT you. lot. can't one that's just... tired. also planes rapid transmission travel though. Well it‚Äôs mask, pandemic restrictions fucked lot stuff. common sense wear 8 hours day OCD overall dislike sensation. Completely great pandemic get sick future. Forever? I‚Äôd like see faces feel reminded non stop pandemic I‚Äôd like wear lipstick show face I‚Äôm young lol. don‚Äôt care people wear future don‚Äôt think would normal wear much there‚Äôs pandemic. even wear 24/7 Asian countries. usually sick bad air quality crowded transit. Well would wager despite everything average american less scientifically literate socially aware 100 years ago. 

About half nation devolved red faced, sputtering fundamentalist sect. Throat swabs done covid. 16yo nose throat swab done September got annual back school cold. covid testing centre. thing testing for. America monument selfish stupid, million cases week now, muh freeDumb important. world amazed watching dumpster fire. America... see healthcare systems start collapsing withing next 4 weeks. happens nurses doctors you? happens call help one there? disagree. people choose work, people get without working. people may choose fluid, less reliable forms work.

I one friend worked years, school without debt. 30s, soon PhD field particularly large job market. plan work gets PhD, either. child 5 years old, live modest apartment everything could need--TV, books, needs, clothes, various hobby stuff. uses money grants scholarships fund lifestyle. parents never contributed dime. 

Since ""need"" job secure healthcare country, free choose likes.

I chosen career traditional corporation. work 40 hours week kid school. choice, requirement.

My friend least two disabilities protected area, worry paying health insurance. USA we'd broke trying keep health. get treated need go back lives.

It really could much better States, people lied daily basis, hard see could be. hope see fight yourselves. Like bunch cult members saying ""You're crazy! believe thing *I'm* certainly crazy. there's way could possibly crazy."" Governor Abbot still useless should. nonpaywalled full article case anyone can‚Äôt access know downvoted. Working office added least 2 2.5 hours day (getting ready, commuting, lunch break, picking kids stuff afterward). used get gas every 5-7 days. get gas month. need expensive work clothes. need school care. I'm buying makeup, going longer haircuts, eating less. I'm saving shitton time money. Added bonus I'm spend day people like. would take pay cut continue WFH. one. virus cause economy collapse unless cases get control

Which apparently many GOP leaders interest doing. going grocery store essential places still get it.

And that's danger, biggest danger. Statistically, masked up, careful without paranoid, lots hand sanitizer, could go Safeway area past month three odds catching COVID super low... probably.

Based hospital numbers around me, odds LOT higher trip Safeway hardware store buy gas gonna kill me. 

That's point. mask behave less people disease get into. less gets recedes eventually average person walk around day without mask.

You know go weeks weeks end New Zealand without even wear mask? Anywhere?

Because whenever anything flare up, send national notice asking everyone mask up, surprise, everyone masks couple weeks. 

Imagine able go FUCKING MOVIES.

We *COULD* go FUCKING MOVIES, people damn selfish. 

And there'd lot less dead people. Don‚Äôt need look 20 years future. bet countries thinking already. Good man got times ... actually bad; less ppl take vaccine...
Which good shorter lines. anti-lockdown crowd realize restaurants can't get make money 30% people sheltering

They never think things lol. Yes no. traveled summer (to South Dakota Wyoming that) assure even then, masks worn mandatory even small airports there, airports like ODR, DEN, LGA. 

While dinners doubt lead sharp spike (and thus sad Christmas), one cause won‚Äôt maskless airport. expect stay calm can‚Äôt panic buy 100 rolls toilet paper??! betting figured they'd travel early beat rush, wait days get tested enjoy nice meal family.

Speaking American, way much hope average American. massive spike 14 days Thanksgiving. I've saying months.  Shocking? Really? state America right direct result behavior past MONTHS completely ignored medical experts. There's nothing shocking that.  really expect bunch people one close happy excuse sit reddit chastise others life decisions holidays? watch Contagion.... fuck *that* mistake. 

I take back. Don‚Äôt watch Contagion. would get around? every place public transportation. would get new car without job? supposed go buy used car break every week costing $$$? fair education system America good. Thanks keeping demand gloves high. Nah definitely embargoed oil steel sales axis.

The embargo oil Japan triggered pearl harbor. USA selling oil steel Japan 1937-1941 Japan invaded China build potent war machine. understand people wanting call China virus, I‚Äôve heard people actively defend virus isn‚Äôt China. 

It originated China, spread people leaving Wuhan, Chinese people world going China Chinese New Years. 

Again, understand don‚Äôt want call China virus. people hard denying Chinese people main cause this? Yeah fiance headed CO right now...going outdoor things away others. Hope isnt bad. Sorta.

Our country huge problem people automatically believe people tell them, without looking all. misinformation, either side spreads like wildfire fits narrative.

The big problem one side (although think one side way worse) general problem people able critically think able read statistics comprehend properly. im staying right fuck watching NHL game‚ÄîWinnipeg vs. Edmonton. NBA suspension announced think first period. 
Blake Wheeler, Winnipeg captain, later said talking Edmonton Captain Leon Draisaitl second period began. They‚Äôd heard NBA news locker rooms said other: ‚Äúwelp, guess that‚Äôs us, too‚Äù. Next day, NHL season suspended. Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt even dope. It‚Äôs stress napping. 'Muricans slow learners. Don‚Äôt plan moving goalposts :) pointing claim based assumption live rural areas opposed majority us living packed together cities coast J R C wizzzzzzzurp Hahaha ignoramus everyone knows IQ can‚Äôt negative. know 99 IQ, close genius perfect 100 get. hit problem head since ass/fecal matter spread covid19 act like aren‚Äôt millions people choose work.

Even it'll happen small chunks. long road ahead us. study went though August. Non mask counties caught surpassed masked counties 25% per capita. You‚Äôre fucking genius. would work well ! marketing ?!  America filled brim ignorance entitlement. continue stay home travel necessary.  Today grocery shopping, old lady coughed one shitty homemade masks. 


Tally one ""preventable deaths"" America. Worldometers 160k last saturday sick shit. Seriously, people going understand what‚Äôs stake here? Unless it‚Äôs protest, people need act responsibly stay home. criteria someone contagious? leave US good back January... saved enough apply work visa abroad. I'm held hostage stupidity trying flee. XD 


As soon reasonable window opens, I'm gone. Brain drain, baby! People vocally adamant Thanksgiving goshdarndit one stop also capital city Illinois, initially assumed meant. spying agencies knew China knew virus December, clearly China bad waiting one month tell us something already knew. Ohh.... won‚Äôt end well get it, stupid. Quit rubbing didn‚Äôt actually work Stanford, off-shoot institute campus believe  hope transform society adapt climate change half society hardcore denial conspiracy?  country perfect. 

even VN fucked Danang tourism campaign. But....it almost inevitable would happen. Well then, maybe take virus seriously. put Germany far ahead USA. went bit crazy people well educated. Yes, Hitler terrible things championed good health, education, manufacturing. literacy rate time ww2 far ahead usa, uk ussr. ran men trying fight war 2 fronts. usa still racist germany put past behind built strong culture. positive cases place employment (none since August) thanks state hotbed activity, people ""masks work, fake"" 180 turning ""I refuse come work, safe"". astounding. ""Those cannot remember past condemned repeat it.""

 (George history tells us anything, Markel said, ""the risk contracting virus spreading virus congregating groups even traditional holiday parties right disappointing, let‚Äôs get celebrate many, many Thanksgivings,"" said. ""The better part valor stay home stay safe."" #Fucked mentioned riots example something even think situation like this. certainly help. Yep. Noem grim reaper. Killing constituents rhetoric. Dark soul, one has. Asymptomatic rapid testing interfere diagnostic PCR testing.

I would even argue testing asymptomatic people higher priority, people symptoms already good reason self isolate, probably seek care based worsening symptoms. cover. Nice. Definitely get contingency plans writing moving dates. mostly worried travel countries - sure look point 100% wrong. everything mitigate spread, would staying put Baltimore NC respectively. 

Is dad really isolating 2 weeks coming Baltimore, trips outside home, grocery store, anything? one done drive NC Baltimore directly? 

Have isolating 2 weeks prior comes? 

Tests return false negatives much return false positives. 

This super selfish, provided taking precautions stating half-assing it, suspect might be. yes, definitely travel. 

Is dad seeing Thanksgiving worth possibly dying COVID? say needs see you, he's going die without maybe ok trade. might also find interesting hospital german krankenhaus like house sick. maybe they'll wake honestly believe people right thing find they're positive? don't.  Amazing literally weld people homes can't leave... idea they're waiting 19 days? That's harm reduction is. Harm reduction saying ""we know group population see family matter what, anything mitigate risky behavior"". Testing guaranteed catch least non-zero percentage positive cases testing. Detached reality?   Don‚Äôt lie. 

They gave people medical supplies, food water, comfort items. 

Just cause you‚Äôre used functioning government doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt exist. That's fantastic! Fingers crossed people start coming together - really believe something leaders dividing communities feeding fear (""they're going take away jobs"", etc.) Lets pick better word maybe. 1995 middle school. ‚ÄúI tested negative‚Äù

- people who‚Äôs name starts K that‚Äôs apparently auto delete sub... Watch world go China flu US flu one easy step!!! doctors hate him! Make reservations holidays.  Book New Years ICU beds today! None. stupid question. 2-3 feet away smoke, vape, conversate. ever sat blackjack table? Updated wording  One thing I've wondering can't find proper answer online: know asymptomatic cases false positives?

I've read sorts theories percentage cases asymptomatic, 20% 30%, 40% even 81%. country (Portugal) people test often (such football players test every match) tend get asymptomatic infections.

I wondering whether fact they're testing often increases chance false positive eventually happening rather ""asymptomatic"". find important since two reasons people tend get careless idea ""mortality low"" together ""most people even symptoms"", might wrong one reason.

Is sure way know asymptomatic cases false positives begin with?  Yeah enough resources lmao. many positives everywhere. Contact tracers gave up? Don‚Äôt forget doctors, nurses, teachers.. People call Australia nanny state time (sometimes justified) enjoy collective, community spirit still have. thought going US route individualism COVID proven sense community still alive makes happy. know. they're already Alberta, means infected people getting (and [Alberta great, curve really flattened since program started Yup fact cases started rising everywhere Europe US soon got cold must complete coincidence then... fact cases abated many parts continents summer... Dude, obvious want twist words feel good upset/offended.

I stand point yes, 1 death many, grand scheme things history past pandemics, death rate far luckily bad could been.

If want take something more, go it. I'm done talking brick walls. Saturdays often among higher numbers week US, weekend effect mostly visible Sunday Monday. able deliver results timely manner?   Well merciful enough grant Ben Carson monoclonal antibodies lol. Exactly, PCR could tested neg well time point. I‚Äôd like majority American population see sense urgency wear damn masks.

Small mom pop shops ordered close, curfew 10 large stores remain open. Guess what. packing big box stores buying crap touching everything spreading vid around small companies people put entire lives would probably safer patron forced business. makes absolutely logical sense causes reasonable person think people charge clueless. 

The measure would make sense complete shutdown every store. None open. Imagine finding remotely terrifying  works patient gets point chest X-ray warranted. exactly early detection. confuses seeing excited people thought ~3 years this.

No commuting, unexpected visitors, bullshit commitments attend hobbies ""me"" time taken seriously. Less sound pollution, less people streets. People keeping distance public etc...

When saw going last, started personal projects years earlier wanted pretty entertained. actually spend far less time online gaming diverse things.

Sure miss taking strolls going movies.

I know much sucks extroverts people kids, like ""enjoying"" weirdos.

Additionally, due we're also seeing positive shifts never thought would happen soon. Oil going shit, government bringing forward push green energy EVs, e-commerce booming, streaming services getting day date releases theatrical releases get soon, Reddit needs accept that. control mid-2021.

US could better job standing covid, easy despite affluent. guess ignore executive orders every level government then. /s Yeah, let's follow China's lead. less 10K deaths /s Yet people come world attend universities. Insurance companies obligated pay 100% treatment cost covid staying home. Yes. less fucked others. Don‚Äôt re-invent wheel. 16week lockdown still masks mandatory. folks packing caravan going Statewide holiday cause we‚Äôre 3weeks new infection.

American people ~~victims~~ **co-conspirators** President's propaganda campaign

Stop letting 70 million pieces filth hook sins. can't believe stupid headline, trusting journalists ever (this first time)

China locks city (*In Inner Mongolia, Tianjin part of*) orders mass tests Tianjin (*which locked down, read article*). can. remember hated life even back then. I'm looking forwards ""over"". Social distancing wearing masks one best things I've ever got experience society. hate line store people fucking ass. hated folks face trying look deep eyes talk randomly I'm OBVIOUSLY minding business. certainly hope optimal conditions, slowly vanishing 3rd? ain't even left 1st wave yet

Edit: I'm talking america, countries, sorry talking rest world Well, Rome originally Republic internal infighting sparked transition much authoritarian Empire. [I'm joking asked girlfriend, covid went super elite hospital system within college system would allow research staff purely working contact tracers, one even called find interacted with. review studies presented. much information. usually take time review Fair enough. Though decisions governments grapple with. much death acceptable? believe around 3 million people lost jobs Thailand, around 1 million tourist industry. 

This government said zero death, closed up. option. I‚Äôm merely sounding though, don‚Äôt really strong opinion matter. Though would err towards side better balance risk struck. IMO closed borders country like Thailand zero tolerance approach harm population good. economy, including informal economy, believed 25-30% tourism. 

No winners situations really. don‚Äôt admire governments job. Definitely depends Texas. Dallas grocery stores I‚Äôve 98% people mask small towns it‚Äôs like 28% True. going free Read article. literally says right there. It‚Äôs necessary go data meeting 12/10/2020 disappointed. LBJ's Great Society social welfare programs completely gutted Bill Clinton fully implemented neoliberal workfare programs 1990's. 

This country going backwards. may mutate Got get points board 2020 over. Thanks info. Everyone gotten crash course FDA procedure year lol. ppl testing Australia says hi Probably need apologise guy swearing bot. Good though. left isn‚Äôt bad. better, it‚Äôs much. think it‚Äôs huge gap it‚Äôs way closer would ever admit. Doordash California better results rest US?  Maybe bars went got food licenses open restaurants Also, think countries would want us taking covid cases visit :/ much like think center planet, part one big global community. assume travel requires proof covid vaccination science rejectors eventually get board 100%. Austin. population happy comply mandate. last 9 months, I‚Äôve seen TWO people store without mask. Also unsurprisingly blueberry tomato juice (+45 Biden Travis county/Austin. Harris county/Houston +13 reference) 

Looking Texas broken county, Austin ‚Äòlucky‚Äô adjust population metro areas. Dallas county 2x population, yet 3.5x cases 3x deaths. it‚Äôs luck. It‚Äôs shock super-blue metro area Texas well. go SE Houston month difference mask culture goddamn wild. in, isn‚Äôt mask culture. still pretty much effective treatment COVID-19. 6 months going pretty much without lying numbers too. still vertical line phase. Thanos nothing wrong. get point. doubt. Remember told February quarantine 14 days? anti-lockdown crowd realize restaurants can't get make money 30% people sheltering....especially upper middle class. 

We deny virus hospitals get crowded. makes people less likely restaurant. get deaths bad economy. still solve virus problems.  Same. went back school end June pick things office still sign outside telling everyone great spring break. unnerving. signed it, it. would nice know chemicals vaccine made from. quarantine fly test city? drive instead? treatment kind prospectively confirmed statistically significant anti-viral activity recently diagnosed, mild moderate COVID-19 high-risk doses REGEN-COV2 made available approximately 300,000 patients, medication out-of-pocket costs, U.S. government allocation program.

I wish doses available! It‚Äôs exciting news, we‚Äôll burn super fast. Also glad see medication cost taken care of. know long run doesn‚Äôt matter family staying home Thanksgiving. Gonna facetime relatives eat dinner here. absolutely right, especially since we're finding pre-symptomatic people biggest spreaders. live Key West, town full tourists right thing state local government nothing. I've got bit negative exposure thing going tourism season heats up. Locals mostly cowering home onslaught, yesterday positivity rate 20%. Oh, see, pretty good think, unbiased times. Nah. They're really really really dedicated that's much want bring Trump something. can‚Äôt compare Wuhan US strain (G614) 10x contagious. Yea think something give Trump partial blame for, untouchable mind set doesn‚Äôt come exclusively him. can‚Äôt tell many times person told didn‚Äôt need condom sex them. majority people think nothing bad happen them. So? Born babies alive thier mothers feed 

Whether life maintained artificially naturally irrelevant

All innocent human life matters Kills guy heading work 4AM. Parents bail out.

This America. crew members near them? 15 minutes? 

what kind flights these? seems like there's strangeness there, guess. Even so, 5 people got 21 cases. fight every day people simply wear masks work... Good luck, everyone. put lockdown place thanksgiving. Haha! stop it! you‚Äôre killing me. Lol! knows what'll like Christmas New Years! Happy holidays! sure sound like conflating protests riots. taking BLM protests pro-Trump riots? going guess never poor country. America never cared poor people. NEVER going anything help people afford stay home months time. realize Americans believe CHILDREN GET FREE LUNCH. really think Americans going help people lost job? American culture worships rich looks poor. Also has. Always will.  enough Americans take vaccine achieve herd immunity. much people suck need convince many people take vaccine possible. live goddamn island shit fix easily like mutated grizzly bear Annihilation luring voice family member telling delicious food they're making Thanksgiving dinner. could pay 50 bucks hour enforce mask rules states... Correct wrong, thats good way get shot stabbed no?

Depends polite ask. kind usually go quick one-jab shanking, annoying jerk gonna cap you, complain shanking capping... that's real trouble starts. 99+% survival rate... economists told everyone virus control damage economy lockdown guess going prove that. also predicted even virus control people resume spending pandemic. Looks like going test well. work code? one nurse? 
We two feel like it‚Äôs sketchy Maybe Romania, football team 23 positive tests turned false-positives. guess positive test proof either. 23 matter. Maybe depends lab works results? clue really. poorly done lockdown probably worse nothing. least nothing done people get lulled false sense security thinking safe since still open lockdown. one specifically referring one Missouri. Sorry, clarify title without breaking rule regarding modifying title reflect article. atlantic great article ‚Äòlagging cfr‚Äô 22 days 1.5-1.8%. 

look st you‚Äôre right money. find hilarious Trump blames China able contain virus spreading outside country 1 billion people, failed keep fucking White house. Y'all already government monitoring cell phones.

They're going use corona, even - there's point, covid going spread US regardless government knowing are. took us month convince grandmother cancel Thanksgiving still arguing thanks giving canceled families wish luck complained difficulty recruiting workers: ‚ÄúLabor, labor, labor; need people,‚Äù exec said. ‚ÄúWe losing people cannot find replacements.‚Äù

Correction, losing people pay poverty wages expect someone else risk health poverty wages. 

There places hiring near me. see lots Go ApPly GroCeRy StoRe comments. hiring. People money shop much. Also, places pay enough cover utilities let alone rent/morgage. looking work, they‚Äôre highly selective,‚Äù Larrea said. ‚ÄúPeople hesitant put risk. There‚Äôs much stake.‚Äù

I blame them. also tired poor people treated country. expected sacrifice everything. majority Americans view poor people roaches. seen attitude subreddit. Telling people go work grocery store also selfish want spend holidays family breath. Yes, least America know knowing half can't wait week, work airport bet ass extra vigilant using hand sanitizer shifts. Can't employ telemarketers this? specialize calling lots people. Imagine good could cared? already know... it‚Äôs happened many times trials. It‚Äôs also new concept vaccine virus, every year tons people get flu shot day happened get flu. Bad luck, much worry about. Curious thesis article meshes COVID Italy early Fall 2019. Enjoy nice quiet (boring) life. I‚Äôm glad like there. didn‚Äôt bring authoritarian issue. fellow did. (Also enjoy indentured servants building buildings, roads, cleaning streets. shhh keep quiet). Wisconsin, changing person positivity test positivity caused plummet 37% like 13%. wish states clearly reported numbers (and [JHU testing positivity showed accordingly) know appreciate party job. 

And that? trying say? I'm assuming native English speaker idea trying convey bud.

It's funny, party got nothing accomplished ramming bunch hyper-partisan judges office that's it, OH giving massive break wealthy one else.... yeah they've reaaaaaal productive. people allowed virus spread US first ones blame China virus  sad truth Biden going inherit mess fuck-wad Trump deaths skyrocketing sworn in, rock-headed, dumb fuck GOPers blame crisis. Can't fucking stand Republicans anymore. dont mind asking company recruited Needs quotes big, complex, ongoing conversation lasted since dawn civilization. 

You're getting voted misinterpreted, needs denied, denying possibility change.

There lots needs would increase quality life. extrapolating conflating increases quality life impossibilities rarely exist except couple places, reality, countries continents better Healthcare systems labor protections America.

The truth America fell behind, hard. got complacent ww2 stopped social programs cold War ramped war communism. Since we've committed endless buckets money war dedicated less domestic issues.

America produces enough food feed whole world. assure you, shortage food. (mainly livestock) eat though ourselves, choose burgers chicken tendies instead food security all. made bed sleeping hard coronavirus pandemic.

America needed issue coordinated lock hotspots contact tracing. America needed let businesses close temporarily pay employees stay home. it. sowed disinformation politicized disease. stopped believing real choice go work.


And now... spreads... last disease... America better. make difference everyone thinks does. Sydney-Melbourne air route one busy domestic routes world start it. 

Also takes root, matter island point. happened Victoria one quarantine hotel handful staff leading major outbreak peaked 700 new cases day. That's infective thing is. Took 4 month lockdown get zero cases 22 days now.

Anyway, Vietnam island, multiple land borders including almost 1000 mile land border China single death July 31st.

Then so-called second wave crushed 35 deaths total took outbreak seriously closed Da Nang mainly located. Collectively you‚Äôre fucking stupid :(

I know plenty good people, damn number Trump/GOP supporters. There‚Äôs many correlations voting certain way life choices.

Good luck (un)USA completely ridiculous point. People avoid traveling thanksgiving obviously, there‚Äôs debate there, acting Covid-19 going infect less billions people people visited family holidays completely dishonest. 

These half-truth/half-lies exactly nobody trust media outlets anymore, it‚Äôs end people think masks don‚Äôt work all/masks social distancing fix everything/Its president‚Äôs fault/covid fake. God awful journalism. Watch tell still trust Bill gates, something Mr bill want people see rmb base currency equate 'running world economy'. 
You claiming USA somehow sort magic ship boats follows laughable - ability project power great diminishing daily.
China's nominal GDP set overtake USA 2025 already surpassed use PPP. 

In foreign affairs, China pursued pragmatic influence whilst USA addicted projecting force.

But keep living fantasy. emperor exposed insufficient clothing. FYI, TB (tuberculosis) caused viruses. caused bacteria (**Mycobacterium tuberculosis**). mean, looking logically, seems like spread comes pre-symptomatic people. don‚Äôt know infected contagious they‚Äôve already unknowingly infected people. simple ‚Äústay home you‚Äôre sick‚Äù virus wouldn‚Äôt ripping across globe. reasonable person going stay home Covid, main problem many idea are. Rapid testing large percentages people *could* save many lives. It‚Äôs logistical nightmare barely enough testing now, it‚Äôs really happening months now. Yes no. feel better knowing know virus feel like people taking risks every single day go on. course chances better know we're dealing still something want gamble really to, know mean? I'm saying true thought. Mitch perfect excuse left pretend they've done best change something base feels strongly establishment really want. believe old career politicians enemies like portrayed media. No. country full people make choices please. far desirable living China. think problem culture war going idols largely lined base. agree though willing big names would awesome way share message. Australia also benefits Christmas summer, longer daylight Winter.

The virus spreading rapidly winter, really, everyone cram indoors activities, plus Christmas shopping season people fucking selfish Probably rental car plane ticket bookings. people planning travel likely already booked tickets reserved rental car. Fuck that. Innocent people dying burden poor. problem individual-- try telling overworked grocery store employee along sacrifices made, can't see damn family either. I'm advocating people spread virus travel, saying onus directed toward institutional failures controlling pandemic.  good it? ""good"", normal. expect leaders provide take power away, violence necessary. course action normalisation horrible, unethical, immoral behaviour among leaders. people vaccinated get sick vaccinations, enough happens nightmare fuel antivaxers everywhere Darwin awards lol question hard economy affected back forward pandemic never control way. Thanks reply source. check out. thrilling sight see hospital work front page r/coronavirus. Reno plenty deniers too. I'm confused, reusable bags banned? I'm actually encourage environment, supermarkets warnings saying possible bring bag people it. cant bring bag pay ones supermarket reason? Obese people generally worse gut health inflammation, theres lots confounding factors, study like one peice enomous jigsaw  slight feeling people want go on, right now, everyone miserable sitting home. lot people wallow collective miserableness. suddenly, shit over, people restart normal, social, happy, outgoing life. suddenly, still miserable still sit home responsible life again. Flew today MCO IAD. MCO bad 99% properly masked. 1% idiots wearing N95 masks nose. IAD less people 

One thing understand airlines would offer refreshments. people taking masks whole safety speel behind airplanes safe calculated assuming everyone wears mask....  funny consider problem messaging 58% take messaging seriously 42% don't. I've playing [R.E.M. - End loop. don‚Äôt pics airports, essential shit across country medical field airports way fucking busy. beginning covid would handful people plane. it‚Äôs back planes full. 

Most people ask I‚Äôm I‚Äôm going they‚Äôre like, well busy right now. Yeah, thanks dumbass flying around take vacation. one commenter mentioned, Pfizer moving get placebo receivers get vaccines well. 

In J&amp;J Janssen trial, say leave study anytime want. free get vaccinated commercial vaccine available, let know mark us ‚Äúexit study‚Äù. One thing discourage enter another COVID vaccine study. Flew today MCO IAD. MCO bad 99% properly masked. 1% idiots wearing N95 masks nose. IAD less people. 

One thing understand airlines would offer refreshments. people taking masks whole safety speel behind airplanes safe calculated assuming everyone wears mask.... Truly galaxy brain thinking. Can't 2nd wave first never ends. kinda hoping people would cautious year seeing business usual bakery work (totally slammed week)I'm disappointed. Stop watching ""news"". America label news entertainment, spit half truthes.

Edit: forgot  I'm sure medical offices mine changes air like operating room every 7 minutes. nervous always ask office booking appointment! go store go bread aisle. many types bread, several brands each. Dozens cereals, around ten years ago. need thirty different kinds Oreos. need mountain dew flavored Doritos. much food thrown away simply store sell it. reason stock much consumers become accustomed seeing much variety. Mcconnel American people: ""I'll give 1200 fuck off""  simply true. entire culture school work place organized top hierarchy. Americans love authority absolutely loathe democracy. Martial law though? Cmon agree lots politicians even trying. Maybe they've given similar view this, governor goes week, tells people distance put mask goes away. 

A lot, maybe majority pop entitled, selfish short sited, inevitably gotta make tough decision spite happening Collectively, deserve it. blame game they're shifting blame you, Funny people still believe started spreading around February. well known since November 2019 virus started. know realize much people got infected/died/healed covid? Regardless shitty response been, still blame medieval country/culture started pandemic muh rights Yeah. bull headed kinda dumb. Lol gonna argue that, love pandering Chinese.

I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs failed throughout west, it‚Äôs definitely still progress dragged due approach. chances stemmed globally without vaccine near zero anyway opinion. running timeline now. 

Not looking argue anyway, throwing worthless two cents around. Appreciate opinions too.  make wonder seriously take external threats keep White House secure. cant take basic disease prevention precautions hope there? Imagine foreign agent getting POTUS, wife, several children good numbers staff protectors. John Lauren‚Äôs style Covfefevcked really. forms vaccines, like live (attenuated), inactive, etc. Generally, small doses virus itself, whether dead alive, give body's immune response develop antibodies it. case, already virus, body already trying develop antibodies getting vaccine help symptoms speed process. Simply put Russian roulette way worse odds. 

Odds negatively impacted Covid quite small.

If everyone vaccinated, party up. feels like end world. MUH RIGHTS ^^/s do, thank much tip! Last checked research said even powerful air purifiers get rid 10% droplets air. works better leave running long time infections happen people inhale other's droplets directly, fast filtration systems work. terrible idea replacement ventilation/masking/distancing/quarantining etc. Dont worry virus came China here, obviously travel east west. messaging 21 days [**2020-12-13 01:59:13 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-12-13%2001:59:13%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

I would imagine places like Japan fairly cautious opening vaccination programs well embedded showing good results, well visitors countries less successful viewed refugee risks, even showing proof vaccination.

We live interesting times. plaguelovers happy American families miserable. People traveling pandemic surprised many people traveling pandemic. Make Americans Get Anally-Fucked. remindme! 3 weeks ""is /u/DoubleCauliflower still safe risking it?""   weird Americans say this. Like guys developed country desired kind education everyone's disposal. India much corruption govts plan even reach people half time. compelled illiterate ignorance. People noncompliant rules know better Americans like actively opposing rules sake it, know better.  watch post Reddit. read saying. must using rural American internet. Snappy site me.  thank wait Thanksgiving.... fuck. ""those turkeys gonna eat themselves"" probably lol know difficult businesses enforce mask wearing people entering stores, can‚Äôt refuse customer attempting pay item? Well, immediate way politicians affect population passing government budget, pays salary government workers. Basically, politicians go strike, get government shutdown. Parkland? BLM riots. happened NY summer, many stores looted burned Manhattan ~3-ish days.

They small percentage peaceful protests going sure, happen well. Walter Wallace riot happened weeks back Brooklyn.  R DUM even administered general public March Get shit together America. guy ruining thing everyone else. Like drinking lunchroom. Ruined. MAFITAA are. fear nowhere near close done second wave.  better now? positive? hard train people wear masks still teach wash hands touching things. People masks buy sanitizer store. People get mad cdc guidelines keep changing frustrating learning well behaves. certain aerosol lingers air. surface theory kinda died off. Best thing staying home, hate know chances less. it, feel them

It nice, getting really physically irritating hot wear one excercising. country? I‚Äôm legitimately planning leaving USA next 12-18 months massive research relocate to.  Rollout vaccines virtually zero effect soon March, get real. American, I‚Äôm implying faith Americans right thing. I‚Äôm explaining probably thought... ‚Äúthe odds slim they‚Äôd get sick‚Äù. People dumb enough travel right likely don‚Äôt fully understand incubation times asymptomatic spread false negatives. don‚Äôt even like running store 5mins. isn‚Äôt enough money world get plane right now, idiots paying so. 212k already estimated true number based average deaths per year year's much higher, 300k already real number. We're already approaching figure take account deaths unaccounted. March easily even unconfirmed deaths. doctors taking virus seriously either, unfortunately. Could worth curbside pickup experience. Roll out, pick goods, roll back across NM line. course stringent lock down/14 day quarantine protocols place NM. joys living right near stateline. No. decide want want safe stay house. 

Everyone made conscious decision ok getting virus. 

If stay house fine. rest us haven‚Äôt go living life. 

Your false moral high ground idiotic. feel bad trying perpetuate argument. solution staying indoors. it. Stay indoors shut up.

I can‚Äôt spread it. indoors fuck nervous? Nope. don‚Äôt control life. Stop malthusian.  really think would post gave af getting downvoted? point try show awful 1/2 Americans are. 1/2 Americans happy shoot messenger.
 Take care. would find difficult remain friends person tbh  LOCK DOWN. LOCK DOWN. Every state needs lock tomorrow. exploding right now. system already overwhelmed. Two weeks catastrophe. applied contact tracer back may, never heard back. don‚Äôt understand there‚Äôs shortage contact tracers yet call recruit new ones. contact tracing infrastructure messed parents covid bubble drove 3k mikes myself, seems do. I‚Äôm female tech degree. looking TEFL opportunities (or au pair considering history) Destroy all, able spread conspiracies online nitpick: Singapore accurately described *illiberal democracy* (with dominant-party), freely elect leaders many freedoms rights restricted liberal democracies. Contrast pre-2019 Hong Kong, *liberal authoritarian* country - China-backed lawmakers almost always held majority, freedoms like speech assembly less restricted Singapore.

Singapore transition liberal democracy ever since Mr Lee Kuan Yew's retirement, party still dominant government, still well-respected people. government able agree laws/policies enact quickly, helped lot Covid-19. That's probably people mean say Singapore authoritarian. (As aside, means mainstream press polarised Western democracies: *The Straits Times*, accused biased towards government, leans right (i.e. less right centre-right), news providers like 
*Channel NewsAsia* *Mothership* centrist) 

(PS: far, seems like voter suppression happened here, personally consider hallmark free elections. think free speech free elections different things.) Nope, according Last Us, brain. live South Australia, ended 3 days. wife disappointed ended early We've working 60-70 hours week pretty much since start year, looking forward 6 days home together. Feel bad saying lot people got reamed financially it.  
IMO warranted, whole state living back pre 2020 normal since April shit would spread like wildfire got out.  
You even know there's pandemic literally no-one wears masks even talks COVID anymore.  
SA health learned lesson reviewing procedures, SA residents wakeup call still global pandemic happening. fucking entitled. Well got here, ‚ÄúLike miracle, go away.‚Äù yeah, blame Trump horrendous response.

There‚Äôs reason he‚Äôs one-term president. Never go full American one biggest ‚Äúnon-profit‚Äù Hospital systems state...the CEO makes around $12 MILLION year. hospitalist worked (and trusted) said sat meeting corporate heads told ‚Äúbrought $12 million profits half, make $24 million next half!‚Äù

Welcome America. unrealistic. 1/15, share either symptoms know positive, likely stay home. odds random people airport COVID lower 1/15. much hard say.  people suffering economic implications actual virus. parents pretty good chance too, btw. doors welded shut.

How people still believe shit? google someone else commented thread what‚Äôs worse rural hospitals shuttered past years there‚Äôs sick go....except Cities like KC ( see r/kansascity this) hospitals full Yep... 

Dont take Asperin though, might ruin you... sound mad corny Vaccine CANNOT shipped sooner. people won‚Äôt suffer selfish FUCKUPS others. ever justified spread like ""personal choice""? like saying personal choice use neighbors house target practice thus responsibility get maimed killed. is, might it. Justify however want. actively wishing people believe differently die. different criticizing.  Well article dumb. Make America Gasp Air Im cities mall moment people full force maybe quarter even less wearing masks. rate testing contact tracing really good people taking seriously post lockdown Ignorant loved life 2020? guess you‚Äôre happier now. There‚Äôs definitely something wrong you. Keep holed basement 2026, one cares.  staying home going cause government become dictatorship, precautions must take, look happened 9/11.

Again think dumb people think staying home going give government insane power, people afraid things like dictatorships gain power. say it! also, think deliver anywhere too? website/app really well made easy use. so... lockdown work. huh. way help cover costs Covid-19 treatment? Grandfather recently passed away it. lived Ohio wondering could find costs, help pay costs cover them. Source pics? wait December numbers. number people require hospital beds staggering general population home reeling work. ""tech guy"" (Or got job good income?) 

If start here: 

This valid Europe Millions going regular Thanksgiving.

You accept this.

They'll regular Christmas too.

You stick shaming demanding abstinence, pivot 'how safer way' approach.

Which includes encouraging people get tested.  course they‚Äôve barely even aware year... running around body armor automatic weapons shooting flame throwers air ramming people cars? withdraw statement. recently watched Shaun Dead thought real... would virtue signaling /s shutdown fucking 100% us economically, virus fucking less 2% infected. welcome thinning weak. happens loved one it, strengthens human race whole. well covid 99% death rate think people would still everyone seems think 1% China's fault. Love see it. Cool, won‚Äôt die, potentially kill parents.

Great idea, dumb fuck. SCOTUS made ruling specifically said cops legally obligated protest citizens How‚Äôd find $15 Turkey? Lol fucking moron. people like holding country back. Unlawful.... 200k dead health service keel there's ur fucking unlawful. kinda love though! airlines still offering service? government give money cover holiday losses. situation good example. pandemic got bad West March. hopefully vaccines coming real soon good amount adult population vaccinated next March/April. 

It's exhausting year coming winter tough, said hopefully year slightly extreme inconvenience. 

If see family every 2-3 years, one year pause big change. Please zoom facetime instead. time type leisurely travel. treat every situation everyone infected virus. stay isolated outside household comes gatherings. Medical system close free. entirely free. Aussie. long understand personal choice. 

Scenario:

Someone decides travel TX NY thanksgiving. airplane people made decision. go homes. 

Anyone decided travel safe. 

Those decided travel not. 

Presumably adults weigh consequences actions make appropriate decisions. 

If risk shouldn‚Äôt travel. 

Is argument people shouldn‚Äôt travel risk can?

If isn‚Äôt issue? fuck sakes, thanksgiving, next year, would rather chance family die one fucking dinner see masks. Thry mandatory, recently flew everyone wearing unless eating. Millions people flying weekend. People already it‚Äôs worse it‚Äôs ever been. response Americans least calls masks get vaccine CVS open mockery refusal comply. Laws power people follow them. Humans ignorant apes. surprise you. Wait months visit Grandma, might going Grandma's funeral weeks never lockdown US We're going anywhere seeing anyone year. we're fine keep us around us safe.

Since wife essential workers, kids go daycare. know we're doing, worry everyone else school holidays. matter keep around us safe, means little everyone else goes like normal Preach Look world around us, mate. bar officially low enough competence ought lauded. gr8 b8 m8 r8 8/8 h8

Fuck outta moth cannot become butterfly people ICU literally dying covid, claiming real hoax. fucking insane.  One recently opened Lubbock midst madness(up then, United Foods land). know people Austin speak highly store. course hour half drive east TX line grocery trip might bit much. Austin Lubbock year. review thing account? Like known it? Well, meant that, use precise terminologies, TPKM (Taiwan-Penghu-Kinmen-Matsu) collection land maritime area whose top-level government de facto subordinate responding government constitutional stipulations. *not equivalent to* ""a state internationally recognised sovereignty"", ""country"".

What said relevant would inappropriate recognise fact mainland China TPKM dealt covid situation *separately*. surprised given he‚Äôs writing hottest US hot spots. cure stupid. know folks went Cancun. also understand people get sick lose minimum 2 weeks worth pay businesses shut good portion staff gets sick. top large medical debt percentage people well. Economically shut hurts us worse long run. That‚Äôs bad consider one dying reason anymore dreams man. need make money pay bills stay alive makes little hard stay home months. really puzzling? 2 weeks Thanksgiving brutal time country. mom insisted Thanksgiving year. told coming sister followed suit. mom still insisting Thanksgiving parents 80s.  even planning going shopping Black Friday. honestly don‚Äôt get feel like talking brick wall. probably loose don‚Äôt come Christmas. Good luck hope stay safe - mom works PSW nursing home allowed visitors province, people immediately infected 90+ year old relative. people scream moan ""bUt mEnTaL hEaLtH!!1"" but... think grandma's gonna feel alone isolation ward (at best) next weeks? incredible selfish folks are. üòÇ entitled? think needs plan fight covid guess I'm ""entitled"" disagreeing way handled. guys sure like put people disagree without providing fucking solutions u guys lockdown travel restricted there? americans truly fkn dumb agree mixed messages. working target okay bars aren't.  

Every interaction people comes chance spreading this. goal reduce risk transmission much possible. slow transmission down. (If done effectively enough would already past this)

People need groceries. need alcohol strange. 

Wharehouses reasonable, interact public help logistical network keeping us starving able wipe asses... 

If could close grocery stores warehouses would.  But, they're essential... 

The confusion, me, things like allowing restaurants bars. Neither allowed, (and leases utilities covered forced stay closed...)

(Also, anthrax closer 100% death rate, transmissible virus stands wreck entire countries. really comparable.) Homer Simpson dumb December January going grim. Sure, travel destination city, get test, stay wherever staying, theoretically quarantine 'til get results avoid re-exposing yourself. 300K December 4th. 400K Christmas seems likely. wait. Death lag infections 3 weeks except Sweden lag 4.5 weeks. Reporting issues I'm gonna get blasted this. Nancy Pol reason gotten any. Im hoping biden office it'll work Nancy Mitch get themselves, we're screwed.   Trump attempted ban travel blocked due public outcry.

You got proof that? public outcry stopped Trump - man put children cages blackmailed Ukraine fired AG played 2X amount golf Obama, hired son-in-law everything - man stopped banning travel due public Earliest confirmed case february 6th, ""community spread"" March.

Wrong. [First case USA January First death [community spread February indicating spreading since early since reality shows New Zealand able stamp out. 

This called ""Post Hoc Ergo Promtpter Hoc"", well Begging Claim. proven New Zealand stampted virus due travel restrictions; merely say that's case claim another argument false. Furthermore, virus reduced travel restrictions mean restrictions resulted win virus. discounting contact tracing, masks, lockdowns, efforts used beat wear masks New Zealand anymore. Masks ""stop"" virus. slow down.

They wear beat virus. second point another Begging Point; imply NZ wearing masks masks work. third point contradicts others; slowing virus help efforts end crisis. EVEN could control covid point, pointless destroy economy it. Why? highest risk a) old b) obese. healthy 30 year old going high chance dying.

You make bad economic point bad moral point. 

The economic point somehow economy OK 3 million people die (1% population), 30 million permanent damage lungs hearts, people work food distribution health care worst hit. That's stupid argument own.

The second point inadequate - people diabetes, overweight, immune compromised, asthma together make 30% population - immoral. making point OK *those* people die. people. Sorry... I'm failed human. care people. people include mother (and asthmatic), sister ( cancer patient), father (an elderly doctor). advice take gaming ,finance gaming PC work wait blow call friends family phone know everyone idea  air travel suspended. Give tax dollars airlines cover losses, problem me. Oh absolutely not, people going holidays absolutely not. want base ass population wear masks, even live still anti mask protests, already low expectation people fuck sakes hwo stupid people be. Germany, Norway, Finland, Lithuania...I could go on. counted New Zealand east. know. nothing I'll make it. Well, 9/11 reason people hesitant accept time around. government already proven use excuse erode rights. sucks pretty much every example history ever shows governments world keen give back take.

That said, I'm unsure dangers mandatory mask-wearing could post. get fears around mandates ""muhaha citizens must wear mask everywhere"" quite sound like patriot act level threat me. bury family cause people can't handle one single fucking holiday without going grand adventure. are't Dakotas lot worse though? shocking? fact, given things handled there, shocking anymore? nothing absolute shit show going States  don‚Äôt see real life. Im nurse covid unit. personally know hundred nurses doctors healthcare workers Florida.

I‚Äôve never met heard healthcare worker, real life, stressed covid. Definitely don‚Äôt know anybody says ‚ÄúPTSD‚Äù it.

I think happy job. Exactly. fucking annoying rest us deal burden longer thanks lack responsibility. uncle married swede despite congratulating work creating r/Masks4All still wear one Sweden claims ""people better social distancing here"". guess they‚Äôre making people wait ICUs hours sending people counties treatment hell then? Keep mind flu season begun. One difference, however, it‚Äôs like travelers spreading affected area unaffected area. It‚Äôs already everywhere. Chinese New Year traveling actually *seeded* virus.  Went free drive-through testing site today, asked health insurance card. gave them, I'm confused. free, need know I'm insured?

Is Covid pre-existing condition now, insurers want know whether test comes back positive not? earth lol People dumb. America deserves this. That's bit obscure! l think article referring travel spread corona virus within China, authorities allowed people rest world spread it, threaten cajole countries threatened barr entry China. turn 2000 car tickets get 6 foot teddy bear. Well said! Agreed counts. Sweden followed neighbors, would lost 567 Swedes Norway's death rate 56 per million vs toll 6,406 686 per million. Following Finland's example would led 688 deaths rate 68 per million. 


This really puts perspective, thank you. 

Another argument I've seen made Sweden acted solidarity neighbors, instead cutting Quixotic path towards herd immunity via natural infection goal, whole region would done better overall. Norway Finland, many cases slowest periods traced back Sweden. insight state Sweden might still come ahead denying reality

Could've stopped there! really horrifying watch denialism common sense, basic science set *Sweden* places (which always looked place science taken seriously). never fails shock sadden think it. That's going happen, stuck inside bunch people lot food? lucky throw masks trash. time swamp hospitals Christmas. 

I told boyfriend I'm skipping mom's thanksgiving dinner. I'd rather show wrong catching Covid, show right. did? cited Italian study done ""The Italian Association Cancer Research"" crazy think China 4k deaths. Singapore going think 11 days local cases 28 deaths. Korea 500 deaths. mediocre? Oh no, kill grandma... must stay inside forever, living life killing people.

Direct quote. sarcastically claim need stay inside forever you‚Äôll kill grandma. Implying support opening things back gives shit grandma dies.

There literally way read statement. Stop backtracking get fucked. remember accidentally get sick might last time seeing them.  it. Better prepared Doesn‚Äôt take mental gymnastics look data. Someone neighborhood 10 cars early thanksgiving even though governor order gatherings 10 people. police dept said call health dept, health dept closed message call police health emergencies. We‚Äôre fucked. Um, yea, past infected entire god damned planet point. time large portion worlds population able distance one another. one would rather avoid getting since I'm risk. Honestly worked airport, I'm sure I'd satisfied anything respirator. voted Trump. don‚Äôt think covid big deal sub wants believe. don‚Äôt care get it, work every day anyways. live deep rural Appalachia. family cancelled thanksgiving. take opinion shove it. end matter feel bad end result still travelling holidays. simply another potential spreader virus US going get worse it. Heard Captain Kirk‚Äôs Jesus Christ. hear this? That's awful. parents really lonely tried guild visiting them. live farm isolated, 3000+ miles away. 

But, high risk, pandemic. love much, I‚Äôm seeing them. hurts much, they‚Äôre lovely people want kids know them. But, wait now. ""This put smile face."" I'm Western Australia remember back April lockdown, local community took seriously. Like, suburb's Facebook page full people talking entertain kids (one thing teddy bear hunt idea, people hid bears front yard families drove around kids spot car). someone popped doubting lockdown needed haircut nails done, told uncertain terms bad idea exactly lockdown fact necessary flatten curve. 

We community transmission WA since June believe, give heaps credit state government getting quick, fed government approving supplementary payments people could stay home work, also give much much credit fellow citizens. People took seriously banded together. really nice see. get wrong, fucking hard, helped people online understood would offer support. I‚Äôve followed since Jan swap sub, wanted echo - everything said documented produced dozens videos per day. watched lot truly amazing see collective effort. Especially volunteers. drone videos huge 20mil cities completely deserted dead, everyone home. price markup scared sad makes I'm assuming 400K Christmas honest I'm considering might closer 500K.

At point probably heading herd immunity.

But death toll going staggering since hospitals already can't deal case load imagine doubling it. point US military probably activated set field hospitals place can. talking every major stadium converted field hospital.  Every day donate money drink get next day. hit head. think Australia NZ have. western countries much.  US state Hawaii. I'm proud Victorian spent months copping shit yet still knuckled got job done. wont learn nothing ‚ÄúThe dream.‚Äù kind talk terrible. It‚Äôs ‚Äúdream like‚Äù want people think others. east figured out, aren‚Äôt selfish arrogant assholes. compare US  rest us can't travel right now, people like family. Boo fucking woo want alone. Cry river. spent Thanksgiving alone last month, survived. want around family too, do. I'd rather around family knowing they're alive, healthy risk. Thanks prolonging shit though, nice think yourself, getting sick fuck fuck everyone else around you. orders emergency provisions given California governor. force law must expire renewed 60 days.

I don‚Äôt think individual sign executive order overthrow government powers given governor California. needed laugh - thank you! vaccine coming months people can't fucking wait one freaking holiday. Ugh...

Honestly I'm done country. hate people much now. gotten point need constantly look shoulder question person next part half Americans truely despicable people. Costco today. Got store 30 minutes past open. Couple pallet paper towels gone could get isle (dumb ass store moved different location) managed get tp maybe 40 bundles left. 
It gone got checkout. 1) recent non-panic times, upped supplies 6 weeks paper cleaning supplies hand. didn‚Äôt hoard, learned close running out. JIC, JIT. JIC = Case. 

2) Supply chain still messed things. ordered refrigerator May. Still haven‚Äôt gotten it. store telling ‚Äúmaybe 2nd week December‚Äù. don‚Äôt know details I‚Äôm assuming least parts come Asia. God can't help us egotistical. Unfortunately, hope Americans stay countries travel within US. I‚Äôll mourn innocent condemn guilty. plenty resources handle Vaccine way, gives shit gracious, eat healthy without working, that's government do.

It's strange me, usa, think gov't anything authoritarian. Covid serious problem world whole danger poses towards overwhelming system. Covid individual huge deal, especially individuals receive best care world, white house probably pretty good external threats would pose individual danger feel required deal it. retail companies afraid angry customers tell employees confront customers. know anti-maskers likely make scene confronted. Mask wearing customers make scene anti-maskers. 

But yes, absolutely confront people following store policy. need germany, definite expectation *someone* would back countries suffered. Could easily ECB, many ways that.  Thank you! feel international community get family holiday. going country. going dining room table. Believe? fact 15 greater 5. opinion matter irrelevant. ""The average per-capita annual income China 30,000 yuan (USD 4,193), 600 million people whose monthly income barely 1,000 yuan (USD 140), enough rent room Chinese cities."" Enjoy hospitals overwhelmed guess control disease cases small numbers, even smaller percentages population. absolute population size matter ... lose control bad get.

And forget, bigger gdp bigger ability deal it. US easiest. cautious, strike excess fear others Also mRna vaccine may become viable future meaning future pandemics happen potentially get prevented faster. Aside tho may problems future climate change possible world war 50 million come guys can‚Äôt imagine everyone going strike working hospital would good patient health. Something telling patient good luck I‚Äôm going strike wouldn‚Äôt sit well people lol Jesus Christ. need stop getting news Reddit. Crazy shit happening Europe speak. America isn‚Äôt even near top deaths per capita. 

Also, fuck BLM Covid? 

I despise Trump anyone, blessed vaccine process. He‚Äôs holding up. 

I hate say this, think *despise* America. That‚Äôs fine, wear it, don‚Äôt pretend like Europeans (50 separate countries) enlightened group lining get vaccine significantly enlightened Americans. Idiot Lied deadbeat dad beat country, made empty promises, told lies, eventually abused too. went smokes never came back. killing millions taking precautions world sees you. People claim good? Death friends? Y'all good it. quit complaining! guys give fuck! get it! Even death change minds! Can't come back call sheep savage that. LOL. (Not unmasked dummies racist. Eh? *not, upset either.* Never been. nowhere? Stay home. Ah, that's fair. I'm probably also bit skewed living harder hit state (with family VT), look VT like 3.5k total cases makes feel silly say ""bad""  seem remember people talking Ben Gazi character....apparently killed like 5 americans like biggest evil do-er time?

Wonder people think this? I'm sure we'll quite testing capacity hit numbers it'll time watch positivity rates. It‚Äôs small risk. MRNA medications vaccine trials ongoing years; haven‚Äôt products approved brought market. safety data pretty robust. Source? Um, look hospitals saying near 100% capacity right *before everyone travels*.

Do think Thanksgiving going make magically go away somehow less cases going show next month? Pfizer might 12+, 3 age groups (Phase 1: 18 55 years age, 65 85 years age; Phase 2/3: ‚â•12 years age [stratified 12-15, 16-55 years Moderna Ages Eligible Study:  	18 Years older  (Adult, Older comment itself, state mind. would rather whine choices choices. Hell, i'm telling Mom morning first first time 23 years home Christmas. mix wanting tempt fate holiday rush airports wanting take month work quarantine two separate states made hard decision easier. think point he's making America flat plenty food going ""run out"". pretty true. mean go drive suburbs / county see many people garden? I'm KY... heck could year round open season deer 3-4 years without really putting dent population.  


If people hungry America, economical logistical issue. food production issue. protesting heart disease cancer? screaming people eat burger use chemicals? 

Lots fucking people die every month 0 clue it. deaths... still people US 2021 started 2020 with. propose take risk myself? going grocery store worse them, I'm really sure point trying make. grocery store employees going inside either way. everyone ordered pickup employees inside loading bags full food, risk exposure would coworkers instead general public. fuck talking about. die die. Dont cry idiots people may infect stole Haiku. forgot author.

We separate
So come together 
No one missing  hahahaha 
Triggered easily, aren‚Äôt you? Go back day care learn get along others. Except us live away family know cook, we'll stocking frozen pizzas beforehand long family members agreed know risk, guys enjoy Thanksgiving gathering. NDA (bringing new drug market) takes 10 months review. insanely fast I'm sure vaccine division every human available reviewing massive amount data. sort covid-19 government regulation would consider oppressive? assume nothing done yet. name public safety ‚Äúmy good‚Äù Ok, started September Italy, take long spread, country 60 million people restrictions time, virus would spread like wildfire. well!!!!! cruel. 100% agree. 1500 day passing US... republicans ‚Äúget job‚Äù Good call. people going get together *won't* that. Moreso, many people eat mask on, know, biggest eating holiday year. 

Right around 1 49 people Colorado test positive shedding virus (they infective), think 1 49 chance anything highway? Traffic risks measured 1 100,000's range. 

Stay f*k home.  I‚Äôm joking obviously, nuts it‚Äôs real shame homeland ‚Äúthe us‚Äù treated this. Ugh would seen coming??? /s üçë I‚Äôm engaged now, pal think unqualified federal judges given lifetime appointments instead?

My favorite part McConnell adjourning Senate without relief, watching pandemic truly explode, reconvening appoint judges going break again. 

And y'all reelected him.

Let's rename Covid ""Karma"". Reporting issues

It seems strange can't fix reporting lag. always makes look like deaths going down, even tough may going up. Interestingly, [Our World Data added note issue Sweden's reporting. That's good otherwise data unclear anyone familiar lag. think we're numb. think lot us fucking pissed, sad, etc. Who's numb? article even provide poll. claims are. government numb, maybe.

Here come articles normalize million Covid deaths. Karma first Thanksgiving.

Circle life. feel course do.
If kind power, know it. Im reading research done Italy Italian scientists. hard believe might originated somewhere else? dont get set stone started China. Define exposed. experience someone ‚Äúexposed‚Äù parties masked, need quarantine. one parties unmasked, quarantine. We're level predicted we'd best-case scenario. government anything, state government never take far. need lockdown that's gonna happen we'll Christmas. 4th one happen? you? 12? Oh absolutely. It‚Äôs rough situation. Almost feels like corporations know can‚Äôt easily strike take advantage share land border country. makes big difference

Unless saying illegal immigrants causing spread virus, would even make closed USA's two land borders, would affect thousands thousands families cross daily work, school, etc

That's whole point lockdown. quote entire comment guy going delete hasn‚Äôt already. Fucking embarrassing extremely aggravating see example people‚Äôs mindset fueled fire. anything justify garbage comes mouth. could quote directly they‚Äôll delete act like never happened. continue life. probably consists working tonight subway hiding covid coworkers ‚ÄúWhy Not?‚Äù yet first time I've seen it. 

Funny world revolve around eyes, Jackson. philly yes...and paper towels limits amount items like chicken beef....augh... Yes wife masks public avoids public places much possible. thinks families totally safe visit, go wine night friends house, play dates mom kids met, etc. almost like criteria safety knows name.

Fortunately agree stay home governor's new recommendations long quarantine exposed testing negative?

Family member exposed someone symptomatic next day tested positive day that. Today third day got tested. getting another test Monday, day 5.

She quarantining. long need quarantine tests negative? Oh no, joke... angry man, hope get help man. Honestly Nice straw man. many vacation homes again?

Dishonest argumentation worse wrong. Asshole again:

If disregard rules travel anyway, zero sympathy get sick die. people feel bad people everything could prevent spread still got sick idiots like you. 

You miss one Christmas Thanksgiving family. Things truly insane right now. go places would think would sparse people seems people ever around. Maybe I'm noticing seems impossible find place without random people milling about. Unless pick traveling you‚Äôre incubation period test. accurate statements get downvoted Reddit vt vt vt vt nomesayin'? crazy me. Working television crew golf tournament. Everyone already edge...wondering going make home what? Fans cancelled 1 day...then entire tournament next day. remember frightened flight home. truly end-times. 

Ironically, probably statistically much safer then, now...but - back traveling ever work - THANKS INDUSTRY LAYOFFS! elaborate/point link? conveniently forgetting large portion workforce casual gets fuck sick leave people could follow simple guidelines wouldn‚Äôt risky hop flight. isolate days test negative, risk low. zero, probably lower risk getting car accident drive there. Everyone needs take little chill pill. see need get popped mouth, fucking jackass. need make sure shoppers taking precautions. can't ficking count many intsacart shoppers wearing masks. wearing improperly, shopping crowd friends.

Be cautious. subreddit bogged doom gloom type people. plenty good news go around. suggest taking time researching positives pandemic help ease mind - lot there.  


If need talk, want links better news, feel free PM me. We're boat need let mental health suffer alone.  


It get better, lot faster people originally thought. :) issue phrase ""little inconvenience"". Masks ""little inconvenience"". Social isolation one biggest inconveniences goes humanity weve evolved throughout time. Definitely nothing little thst totally spike. Cases started going pre July got even higher. It‚Äôs politically correct state fact Nice. know 50 million people travel ""method"" simply recalculating number deaths cherrypicked western countries deaths per million proportions cherrypicked Asian countries.

Following long rant bashed individualistic, money loving, technocratic west contrasts idealised far east sounds like socialist utopia. Something absurd anyone knows anything Asian culture politics. Everything sounds extremely simple easy, leaders listened genius like him.

I say without hyperbole, one worst, lowest quality, pointless things ever posted sub, even though competition fierce. user comments research effort piece garbage. linked article good comes incorrect conclusions. detected earlier Italy means available samples study time period someone thought it. occurrence September 2019.

Here reuters article better explains original article remember correctly also assumed virus present france earlier detected someone reviewing lung x-rays late 2019. It‚Äôs symbiotic expect covid isolation units function staff member exposed covid can‚Äôt come work? Freedom speech, combined sufficient freedom regulation lead media run states. Media naturally going protect interests big business, one themselves.

It take first get here, although certainly somewhat natural end arrive given enough time. instance freedom speech, also well funded pro-science pro-information public media spending, serving inform public. Ofc, difficult maintain money-that-be find inconvenient narratives want sell. Look Australian Broadcasting Corporation's decade cuts muzzles conservative govt there/(here, case).

But still live hope one day understand services well funded first place. like 70% trump voters like that, 40% biden voters still success story containing virus. one said successful hygiene overall, mental gymnastic? see source here, assume paraphrased it. see graduated ‚Äúchild care facility‚Äù rather high school considering ignorant words are. feel I'm minority this; care came from. I'm interested species hopped minimize chance future events; Covid there. Italy China, Alabama.... matter, messed life regardless origin. Yes They're going discuss weeks approve late make difference. USA: Come Man! 

 [Triple-facepalm.jpeg (915√ó560) science is, bunch hints &amp; around us, &amp; works things happen &amp; use info. We‚Äôre able confirm &amp; believe multiple [experts] also able observe, record &amp; recreate hint. reason know bananas yellow, almost everyone confirm bananas generally yellow. said gravity, existence confirmed consistent results observed. Big turkeys really demand year due smaller gathering. Stores trying get rid them. am, I‚Äôve isolated since March it‚Äôs worth risk meet family friends. years going different. it‚Äôs absolutely easy, it‚Äôs heavy long. keep going little longer. exhausting part knowing live life people, can‚Äôt convinced little inconvenience end, goes long way help everyone. keep liven, part problem solution. people cant live isolation either. lot judgement reddit people trying stay alive mentally. people live alone. supposed do? 9 months. That's long time completely form emotional intimacy. evidence zoom help many people cases make people feel even alone. tricky situation, also feel blaming individual people isnt answer. telling people cut support systems selfish, completely unfair.  also going sense complacency well state suppress cluster.

Where live started second wave last days, whole reason started traced back complacency public. headline alone gave anxiety. Whew. It‚Äôs gonna rough couple months. Welcome hell, USA. think skews age obesity Question anybody educated I: vaccine trusted fully? I‚Äôm pro-vaxxer, fact one put together quickly, (from tell) hasn‚Äôt studied enough identify potential long-term side effects, reason worry here? Go
Australia üá¶üá∫ Woooaah! 'first thing' perspective cool way look it. comrade, virus never China! American myth. came uh... ummm... Italy? 

All hail comrade Xi Jinping! Yah RN covid unit. quarantine rules don‚Äôt really work us. can‚Äôt quarantine exposed exposed every single day.

All get temperature check enter hospital. get covid stay home test negative once. back go. senate clear relief coming, people voted month ago Republicans senate, knowing means relief coming. 

That means two options shutdown starve death don‚Äôt. 

There third option. 

When people say want lockdown, ‚Äúwithout sort relief‚Äù unsaid second part already know relief provided. car=good Nah, eugenics selective clear bias goal.

50% everybody makes real estate cheaper. covid starting hit area people saying 'well everyone pre-existing conditions caused deaths' mostly old people. 

A lot ""none friends died care?""

while also claiming good empathic christians. think inconsistent leadership, 'back forth' ""guidance"" played role we're dealing eight months later? ironically - safer then, now. go-time. umm :D God damn americans, fucked country live on, hard fathom USA lacks common sense Sadly time idiots travelling Thanksgiving Christmas...

I hate country people much. Covid sucks...pre apocalypse era could eat garbage care....nowadays people look like savage.....fuck Covid specifically work Industry submissions also (I actually started Pfizer) lightening speed review. worked specifically vaccines, INDs (to start small scale human trials) take 30 DAYS review. NDAs (bringing drug market) 10 MONTHS. Three weeks nothing. household 2 making turkey gumbo, maybe getting pie.

I'm thankful family like ""Stay tf away, please"" too. miss sure, want miss permanently. $15 turkey checking in. Staying home family unit, sorry relatives. restaurants serving people. People generally eat 3 meals per day, getting Mc Donalds, getting Walmart. said, almost every grocery store large labor pool available restaurant layoffs. Bruh, bill stalled Congress election. Everyone talking it. republicans drumming fake election fraud claims make seem like nobody talking it. China may mishandled completely unexpected virus peak flu season beginning quick stamp down. greatest nation earth still struggling almost year. Agree, wear mask, keep distance. SoCal can‚Äôt go store business without mask. lack common sense. hadn‚Äôt heard one indeed another long haul flight March 13 cases, masks mandated. that‚Äôs two flights millions. flying high risk there‚Äôd hundreds super spreading events flights.

A 0.25 rt study incredibly low that‚Äôs even remotely worth arguing. normal us eat baby calves caged can't move grow muscles, eat random chicken parts mashed nugget form, whatever fuck hot dogs are, mash turtles make soup them, use placenta beauty products? Every culture different. sound ignorant. gives damn? research finding earliest sources disease confirm source origin, that‚Äôs bogus. Also, doubt China actively trying prove virus originated them. don‚Äôt know, truly, never will. Worst thing I've watched poor traveling nurse left El Paso hospital middle night. talked hour FB live stream ""pit"" patients left die. Young patients too.  left terrified got sick would die pit. Horrible.  like education goes bad, even kids stayed home school year went back safe would still ok. ESPECIALLY compared potential alternative. Or, even learn *well* remotely complete waste. Okay know super related particular thread. KNOW cases rise serious, really hope come COVID skeptic here. 

But I'm seeing headlines us (the United States) hitting record number new cases every day- also seeing record number tests taken every day? Record number negative results?

 Again, I'm disputing shit wildly control I'm masking careful, I'm also curious numbers. entirely disagree. hard speculate also think American psyche really loves antagonist. Trump could spun ""we must fight common enemy oh BTW china's fault"" would certainly made cult behave differently minimum... could go.  we're together

Teacher, another group? Never implied lining up. plainly stated Americans worse. get wrong pretty high heights, also really unexcusable lows access whole. european countries sink low mean comparitively sinking lower. 

My primary news source NPR. read politico articles well. Also like listen legal eagle's political commentary. due kentucky relatives toting Blaze Breitbart, read trash try understand coming from.

Also I'm sure fair claim despising Trump anyone unless part demographic he's sexually harassed, pushed land, threw paper towels denied similar support 'real parts US, approved stealing children from, condoned violence towards based skin color, etc, etc. maybe angle take radar?

Apparently can't see broader implication meant 'categorical' prior post. choose believe smart ignoring that.

What's thing quite european countries again? Universal Healthcare? bottom line matters US sweep bottom line rug best possible. needy US treated properly, yes, something wrong country. real risk covid mean impoverished black latino community suffer worse elsewhere world. know I'm privileged. I'm also blind friends, family, neighbors died, gotten evicted, lost jobs tens thousands debt breaking even before. obligation look see things going wrong people immediate life demand better justice. can't point finger elsewhere justify happening doorstep. Bullshit! something that's perfectly easy explain binary terms! üòÇ yep you‚Äôre correct I‚Äôd trust Russia... COVID came china, speak china constantly, fucking hate government. hate people, rich culture heritage. instance hate US government, there's subset country actively fucking hate. selfish, self centered fucking bullshit attitude. Man honestly shout americans pulling weight FUCK conspiracy toting, muh freedums loving fucks making corona virus spread easy fuck. can‚Äôt think way safer 

You could stay home. mean we‚Äôre middle pandemic, got sick someone partners work irresponsible. It‚Äôs reality we‚Äôre living right now. glad job. trying quote Buggs Bunny ‚ÄúClerks meticulous‚Äù

you mean like Sweden lol Hey didn‚Äôt downvote you. I‚Äôm saying stop fucking eating 3 hours airplane. promise unless medical condition you‚Äôll live. Dude also drinking ton booze medical condition I‚Äôd imagine alcohol terrible it. Iraq obvious. someone takes every precaution absolutely trying get virus... hell spend much time fucking depressing hell hole subreddit? Well word say basically good health yeah you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs fuckin badass Schools still providing food even closed. summer normal conditions. even send home weekend back packs food live. Yeah, they're advanced markets people buy eat bats anteater genitalia, among another things. mean good. briefly entertained plans visit family 600 miles away - families quarantining 2 weeks prior visit, driving 10 hours visit minimal stops, always masked leaving car seeing anyone else visiting. However, time travel approached felt increasingly anxious drive possiblity something go wrong way home. cancelled month ago, even cases really spiking area. much risk us get comfortable. Sigh. traveling ensures Thanksgiving trips future. Jesus Christ dude chill frequent gym? Maybe uninformed spin classes occur enclosed cardio rooms recycled air, individuals seperated working independently. cannot choose punish conduct properly open air environment single case negligence. airports shut commuter traffic major highways blocked commuter traffic across state lines shit would lot less worse.

Seems way counter absolute fucking insanity authoritarianism. Imagine fucking ass freedoms way fix things opposite freedom. meant insult though. people write stupid articles obviously, actually disabled. help vacation destinations offering big deals get people cone right now. Capitalism care people, money.  3rd wave? first wave never ended  Math wrong here.... Cases per million How? lower US nothing proud of. We're gonna get Korean takeout! Zoom Thanksgiving Yeah, one thing another.

So many people still able comprehend what's stake. proper leader enforced lockdown measures allowed Doctors/ Experts speak matter exclusively, perhaps life would near normal like Australia New Zealand.

I guess many Americans prefer stressful, uncertain overall low quality life is? job required remove work remotely different state Bingo! People shitting others trying make living. mom doesn‚Äôt understand won‚Äôt come down. also hasn‚Äôt gotten COVID cannot believe she‚Äôd probably die experienced symptoms did, let alone everyone else family. lot Reddit discounts amount moderates don‚Äôt want insane changes balance society. reform needed good sure, party listening far end voter base going lose majority vote.

Leaving schools open going help anyone homeless kids bring home virus kill thier caregivers. mention live done rest thier lives. (Through fault thier own) really like 5% would get significantly sick. portion fine would skew perception state leaders important. Laws vary state state :) worker friendly people selfish, entitled fucking assholes.

Now I‚Äôm struggling caring others half fucking country shares person‚Äôs beliefs. It‚Äôs cute think Republicans won‚Äôt block future stimulus retaliation stimulus blocked Election Day. Actually, everyone knows lol. USA pretty nice track record self destabilizing years idea coworker looked Amazon looking big bulk order non covid research healthcare Amazon likely decline us order....

Trump acts like logistics problem supply issue. someone help come shit ton good reasons 80something year old in-laws go FL January? 

My first reason I'm giving signed wills yet. Honestly, nobody really knows point. thought test negative, don‚Äôt symptoms anymore, less likely spread virus. started [in tho call China virus guarantee ain‚Äôt Chinese spreading it...now. guess, I‚Äôd say majority white folks keep calling Chinese virus ones spreading shit. That, what‚Äôs frustrating. I'll get coffee started work cargo. Commercial cargo. passengers. So.... say everyone stay home. mean government shut whole country down. Everyone. Pay us stay home. older people gonna first line? want parents get vaccine risk thought could blend naming Tom Brady?! *Fool*!  I'm really sure point trying make.

That (again, saying necessarily) appreciate fact forcing people work stay safe home. incredibly privileged position able so, everyone can. grocery store employees going inside either way. everyone ordered pickup employees inside loading bags full food, risk exposure would coworkers instead general public.

DO actually think posisble every single person town get efficient online ordering done? can't na√Øve. really hard full delays beginning year, places even close fully. Imagine horrid experience would every single person even moderate sized town order online. insane think would even possible, logistically. 
And another thing illustrate exactly privleged position find in....that assume online ordering credit cards common even give second thought. possible everyone go online buy shit.

You hold house thinking fantasy world everyone orders food online quickly, efficiently public come near store employee....but possible, shows lucky truly are. People working risky situations serve order leave house. egg thing bc flu shots egg proteins them. others def interesting guess we'll see focus going forward forgetting 10 billion dollar rainy fund too. reality like 16 billion.

ICU nurse functions direct med surg nurses (who never worked critical care setting) taking critically ill patients.

Imagine even one patients coughs vent, takes long recover oxygen afterwords, crashes.

I knew Halloween going Thanksgiving, sane half family (the ones would actually hosted) agreed.

It's kind reverse ""The lord come like thief night"" situation. Yeah, last forever. nobody know date virus gone date arrived passed. There's much lag metrics. ""Indefinitely"" mean ""forever"". Totally!!  Definitely religious masking trying keep distance people. certain got work someone came office hacking sneezing everywhere waiting used fucking desk phone, found later. first thought came husband I'm sure.  asked work symptoms (I work hospital paper pushing role she, like needed there) said allergies! 

I told leave immediately call employee health dept get tested. refused involve boss. ended testing positive, ended testing positive, lady cubicle across also tested positive.  unfortunate cubicle mate still battling pneumonia living motel right see elderly husband congestive heart failure already home oxygen. Getting virus would probably kill him. 

I'm sorry think people like get wrote (the lady came office, mean) . day sign form saying fever cough sneezing GI symptoms.  straight lied form cubicle mate can't even go home pneumonia. get busted lying form signed? husband said really thought allergies penalized. buy second day age one knows allergies, strep, regular cold, COVID.  mean, that's kind point can't come work cold symptoms even runny nose. 

All say even cautious relative luxury office, still got sick someone else careless. use story people want come visit see easy spread even taking precautions. Nope. [one Swedish scientist said face mask recommendations society all. People still gather en masse malls.

Let learn own. even see xenophobic racists right thread try spin recovery bad thing. people ask, Chinese getting nationalistic. getting hardline.

Your answer right here. fat bully threatens every day, talks shit every day, slashes tires, sends threats boss, open carries AR-15 front house points fun, cops nothing, buy gun? bully says aggressor buying gun, going listen going buy ammo?

Oh, expensive? Don‚Äôt give fuck 80 year olds might die?

That‚Äôs you‚Äôre entitled piece shit. thing borders close them.

And there's UK .... I'm sorry hear ü•∫ everyone else. :)   solution virus ""pause world three months"" actually solution.

You nothing, people try hit pause button ignored.  Economics emotional despite offensive view it. EMTs trained days. low skill job pay well always people willing entry level position. He's not. 40% Australians live two cities, Melbourne Sydney. 90% country lives one 18 cities/large towns (inc. Melbourne/Sydney). *still* fuckwits threw shitfit lockdowns. live China remember truly locked were. stopped inter-city travel, public transport out, even bulldozed roads leading towns. appartment complex gated community gave every household entry/exit cards, allowed leave community every two two days. January April crazy time worked. Everyone kind hunkered down, though rules came government neighbours enforcing them, kept line. China shut completely. business closed least 3 months. Now, never pandemic. still wear masks metro public transport life pretty much gone back normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

In short, travel Thanksgiving, wear mask try avoid people long can. sucks, better everyone long run. True, US perspective, practically free. wish masks mandatory inside Sydney. shops it‚Äôs pre-christmas chaos hardly masks. Come on, people, we‚Äôre yet  Also, point expect medical staff exhausted catastrophe unwillingness take even basic precautions, see huge exodus profession. Countless tragedies making. Soon thousands people learn thanksgiving gathering killed someone loved Xmas. Sigh. Ya. Freedoms duuummmb. Civil liberties freedoms important pandemic saying lines pretty well study 93% people develop immunity Whereas US states mass cases nothing?

Tell better government? parameters ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù? Good jobs, growing economy, guaranteed welfare terms food, housing, medical care, etc? Anything else? covet right vote it‚Äôs sake?

The reason ask appears viewing political system vacuum. US successful last 100 years due democracy, sure. also large labor market, already top economy prior WWII, economically innovative, fair legal system, subject invasion ruin WWII (or point history, matter).

It‚Äôs helpful analyze vacuum democracy also responsible rise people like Trump, Mussolini, Hitler. Texas‚Äô governor $6 billion stimulus funds that‚Äôs he‚Äôs sitting nothing with. Maybe, maybe good idea lockdown 8 months. People would taken lockdowns seriously shorter. FYI France scientists recently demonstrated rigorously lockdown curfew measures absolutely impact dynamic virus.

The thing helped prevent spread enable mass testing early isolate infected persons.

Other studies starting appear collateral deaths result widespread lockdowns. 231M figure lower adjust people gained immunity regular infection, especially infected Fall/Winter period‚Äîassuming vaccinations roll mid-Spring? estimated 40% US population get together Thanksgiving least ten people. ten percent people become infected we're looking 13,200,000 new cases, that's start infected others outside gatherings.

Potentially doubling total infected within one event? I'd say megafucked might even putting mildly. Totally concur. Posted anything seemingly positive long term relation Covid seems outlawed. havent watching hospitals situation see would think that. first wave New York issues rest country could help them, can't happen anymore jurisdictions runaway viral outbreak. hospitals reaching Peak capacity simultaneously half population adhering social distancing mask use going holiday. literally worst case scenario.

US tends benefit. Ok - hope feel better lol Car tickets, duh. I'm sure alternative better. Leave borders open tourism delay eventual lockdown guarantee domestic epidemic go eventually months later. One likely can't get rid of, actually have, actually eradicated domestically means *need* internal restrictions (there still commonsense precautions like masks malls public transport, people complain that.)

I see scenario tourism maintained, ongoing basis, virus contained also. eventually end lockdown scenario anyway, far virus far deaths.

Is country world managed this, remained open mass international tourism throughout pandemic virus surge causing subsequently impose restrictions? whole thing apart agenda wait see that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying ...good luck yours!!

I actually already working home. expected occasional office meeting work related bureaucracy. That's point.

The pandemic precipitated big changes would've taken decades otherwise something I've enjoyed seeing midst terrible mismanagement human race last decades.

Best luck Australia. are, not. Don‚Äôt underestimate us. people, Canada, Germany, Japan, even Netherlands people bad things one time length history, long ago

We inequality United States healthcare, income, housing more.

There among us, top 1%, feel higher taxes right programs would good. know someone 1% somewhat Main Street versus Wall Street got personally legally suffered financial loss fat cats Wall Street. absolutely risk this, please spread misinformation topics thinking GOP already shown they‚Äôll handle Biden presidency. Anything fill vacuum he‚Äôs inaugurated become new Bhenghazi/emails/birth certificate first year office.  Covid19 infection rate deaths climbing lot Europe. good argument relying tests instead quarentine. Sorry, forgot Canada.

Public kind board measures, 9 10 Premiers (Govenors) conservatives health considered Provincial matter Federal one little national coordination. think make exception pandemic. Depends mean ‚Äúlong-lasting.‚Äù

It‚Äôs always looked promising immunity lasted year people, ever 3 6 months 100% confirmed. It‚Äôs year things get murky, coronaviruses don‚Äôt usually give life long immunities, one year so.

Now, that‚Äôs say SARS-CoV-2 can‚Äôt give longer year, nothing strict, it‚Äôs unlikely. That‚Äôs something really need keep mind going forward, we‚Äôre getting close many infections year old. Halloween?

Lol ok. 

Not Schools open 2 months ?

But one night kids trick treating outdoors? West prolonged period destabilisation. East (China especially) values stability things.

Look Western politics, destabilising influences impacting ‚Äúold‚Äù democracies... Swings right left... bigger swings - bigger distance poles - less stable whole thing becomes. think. get scoffed laughed at. I've never full anxiety fear. Ikr Wow. That's right, it? year progress U.S. deniers. I'm one avoiding questions. Lemmings suicidal mammals. Sweden 5th highest death rate Europe second wave started. current massive rates infection mean quite likely regain position time second wave over.

Its strategy trying achieve herd immunity disaster. countries tried mimic encountered disastrous results.

If Czechs successful terms PR Swedes been, instance convincing population managing well stupidly aiming herd immunity, people woukd pay attention Czechs aa much. thoughts ""optimistic nihilism"" people often embracing? find strange, since existentialism edgier moniker. Wow, mandatory testing online classes, someone administration clearly understand virus works! 

There must another component this, isn‚Äôt listed article, students active online accounts may also physical access buildings / study spaces / physical resources need critical thinking skills. wonder 3 weeks community transmission active cases/deaths, didn‚Äôt relax rules considering they‚Äôll taking effect come December 13th, point, unless something bad happens, they‚Äôll 6th week community transmission cases.

He restore back Stage 1 it‚Äôs going take long take effect. gets me. War Drugs - protect yourself!! much care bout you. 9/11- thousands killed - invade multiple countries based lie pre-emptively fight terror - much care you!! look you. 

COVID comes along = costs $$ fight return profits forecast next months ...crickets 

They really give two fucks you. testing, ***identified*** cases. 

FTFY testing *create* cases, shows already are. 80% = 1 5 doesn‚Äôt work... prefer call selfishness. Summer vacations responsible October's surge, unless friends went vacation two weeks ago. Yeah Canadians pay insurance anything. free. even thr government pays. doctors, scientists, pharmacy workers volunteers.

/s Oh supply chain appliances furniture fucked. Things used take 6 weeks taking 6 months. don‚Äôt see getting better time soon. seriously wonder whether US going hit herd immunity vaccine even broadly available. 

Some studies suggesting actual infections reaching high 10x detected... meaning US *actually* seeing *2 million* infections day. daily case counts rapidly accelerating, could hit 70% population months. Well brother law RN Texas hire 60 new emergency nurses come town work completely understaffed getting filled cases. also buy mobile morgues. 

The situation definitely dire. downvoted? sucks true.  slightly good news ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô isn‚Äôt light switch turns 70%. 

I think, already, places like NY getting partial slowing spread it. 

Even lower percentages like 10% 20% slowing effect spread. sure, wish finding ways better slow spread.. still good back-of-envelope maths see little good even scary numbers. Social Dilemma documentary Netflix explains concept coming straight Execs assisted development. think know difference indoor outdoor air circulation. good Sunday umlautbaever stay safe! holiday numbers going scary. Canada, start big surge began Thanksgiving mid October. Things going get ugly American Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas, New Years. Sorry, read retarded language.  Yes. Good luck considering like 30% people seem realize mask goes nose Oh no.... Reach new technological age?

We‚Äôre gonna need new mindset we‚Äôre gonna survive next century. anyone blame America spanish flu aids h1n1? hope Brazil's methods work (or improve) pointing article seemed implying ethnic/racist bias case. didn't. soon federal government got wind it, quarantined city 20 million people within 2 days. Said doctor got silenced local authorities sharing info colleagues reporting it, Beijing.

Also virus found blood samples Portugal Italy early september. hey still China's fault discovered warned everyone December. People West take serious burned. Yes. exile internet, safe space? Go Hospital followed Go Morgue

japanese life % speedrun looking top notch. China got it, it‚Äôs fault cause dirty. 

Same thing co worker, it‚Äôs office that‚Äôs dirty reason got it. can‚Äôt them. can't imagine still fucking energy get worked people enjoying rate

it's months, one listened march, they're gonna listen now. take fucking eagle scout sash said million times Americans better start learning Chinese. Well, yes no. seen massive excess death maybe could different argument. year's death rate far previous years. 

When looking support might important remember different sources information Sweden get abroad. get information directly FHM whilst go reporter foreign media, often seen reporters adds biases articles (and understand why). understand want parrot FHM tells them, add debunked ""information""? E.g. herd immunity. winning man? /s year yet, Japanese used 50 foot robot yet.
I don‚Äôt know released contaminated Fukushima water ocean yet.
My guess Japanese given waiting Godzilla come naturally, little bit extra nuclear waste water hoping Godzilla shorter time frame.
It aliens radio burst deep space last week. Either way hoping see 50 foot robot something.
While rest world worried COVID Japanese building robot planing Olympic Games. people setting charity pages afford medical bills. shit it‚Äôs people saying it, least pushing message: wealthiest finding propaganda push everyone back work ‚Äúkeep economy alive‚Äù instead people. Damn, us still optimism. way see slow due lag period reporting.

Otherwise, think we‚Äôll hit first second week December. Right? couple months isn‚Äôt going magically find anything else, yet EUA takes like three unnecessary weeks analyze data virus ravages world. like verruca salt Charlie chocolate factory, want now! Hi Gov Newsome! Imagine Covid 1% fatality 5%... ~35% like MERS. would civilization-ender scenarios. think conspiracy theories would exactly people would attitude lesser degree. 

""I 65% chance surviving virus, forced go bars?"" China tried everything save lives. America let virus run wild people die. Tell care lives? Fcking painful indeed. likely surge based upon single event, likely second wave nature covid, reported beginning. don‚Äôt care China isn‚Äôt democratic. kind system allows monster like Trump taking power. I'm sure could worse. airlines redesigned could get infection rate /s. there's profit redesign that.

Apparently there's also profit redesign get rate down. improperly done lockdowns destroy economies point. false idea economy suffer necessary COVID mitigation. industries take bigger hit others regardless, good longterm mitigation nulls need severe restrictions like SPH orders actual lockdowns.

The fact Americans continually asked give certain rights freedoms exchange methods working. Instead demanding change responsible, blame other. Fascist üêñ advocating murder non believers. USA really rounding corner. Turns exponential growth line rounds up, down. important is: meet people regularly? change your/their risk much.

Are far away usually meeting people? exposed people people vice versa. nlt understandable whole country ignorant dumb. Yeah, know everyone like that...but still wtf usa saving household, unfortunately... going article says. Pfizer's 50 million US, include shipped countries?

Don't get wrong, amazing news, better experts thought possible quickly. I'm saying get tough Winter thing beaten enough make big difference. International travel vs domestic. 


Ofc I‚Äôm staying home, still- prefer accurate possible. would shocked upper management already contacted. Thank god anxiety disorder guess three day lockdown South Australia due lie COVID positive person. literally counting seconds lockdown ended everyone went crazy going pubs dine out. dumb. 3 days...

It seems humans really cant resist instincts dopamine neurotransmitter. founder CEO BioNTech said best case scenario it'll take autumn vax 60%. said like 3 days ago. Pot kettle black god must hate guy ""free"", ""at additional cost"". Yes already spread going made . That's comparing apples hand grenades yes roundish . Well, honestly ain't wrong... May add, one 95% effective, one around 94.5% effective less storage issues. ""my nose closed"" loss smell ""I smelling something"" loss smell? Thank you, Joyful82, voting PublishDateBot.

This bot wants find best worst bots Reddit. [You view results reply comment, I'm still listening votes. Check webpage see vote registered!)  It‚Äôs important make distinction. Lagos fine this. Haiti. China. Cuba. places shit unexceptional. They‚Äôre fine. Yeah good. dont want spread around now, especially since vaccine sitting 95% effective we?

Fucking whimp Good bot personally, no...for one live island middle Atlantic Ocean (Newfoundland) we've ever 400 cases total, second, I'm introvert leaves apartment 2 -3 hours MONTH, almost never even come contact anybody all, thrid, mandatory masks actually punishable fines even jail terms needed enforce rules, I've wearing mask every time leave house since last February started

so ,no, spreading anything asshole, get high horse Damned freedom lunatics!!! want live want demand! DaRe tHeY!!!! want move probably definitely last Christmas? Merkel said 60-70% Germans get COVID end pandemic back early March. China good. buy Western propaganda people letting hundreds thousands Americans die easily preventable disease. 49 states territories choose from. even better, leave country. course I'm generalizing. can't really obtain conclusions anything without generalizing.

Germany (and Northern European countries) indeed handled virus well. Merkel indeed understand exponentials. exceptions. average, handling disastrous. averages linked post speak themselves. live one areas Europe still reasonable leadership, good you. case majority us: countries heterogeneous Spain, France, Italy, UK, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, etc. utterly botched (and course, US well). Lucking first wave botching second like Czech Republic, Poland or, much lesser extent, Slovakia still botching it, way.

What's exceptional European countries can't run keeping borders closed months (far ""indefinitely""), countries fine? Perhaps related brittleness mentioned?

Finally, know racist Westerners I'm one them. I'm exercising self-criticism, something sorely lacking countries. know what's ""borderline racist""? Seeing another country taking drastic measures (like totally locking huge city), seeing cases country, thinking need anything hey, West, better barbarians. way, hope know politicians Thailand Laos, don't, quite racist assumptions. Denmark, China think 95% reduction something 99% survival rate would enough people, guess not. flashed auto accident stats windshield driving, people turn ignition. vaxx game changer. better half works office approximately half chinese, new year (jan 20) quite went back China. returning wearing masks home, ever since. Many opinion (the west) stupidly cavalier something obviously serious . That's thought brand-new kind COVID, probably would done otherwise. forgot mention freedummmm crowd appeared would 100 strangers sit close together 18 hours. Perhaps watching whole series star wars films cinema marathon session...?

If cinema's open...

Your saying people deliberately something do, would risky air travel. Sounds like definition air travel needs reduce risk. appreciate wrestling remarks, lol. get bad car accident that‚Äôs fault. You‚Äôre gonna able call Morgan sue getting covid ER. Wow you‚Äôre hero. Thank much service. See? works! ;-) amplify spread something crazy. Buckle fuck down. comment dumb. course people packed gym traveled see family holidays pandemic. Thanksgiving biggest travel day year Masks fine closing people's livehood, curfews, literally forcing people stay apart other, dystopian nightmare. Governments using pandemic grab power, there's literally film made 2005 exactly that. Happening France too. attend other‚Äôs funerals too. Btw, masses streamed online. New Zealand Australia ruled white majority yes, geographically close Asia exposed Asian influence Americas. like US Latin American economic/ cultural influence. realize vertical horizontal. Asymptomatic cases could pre-symptomatic post-symptomatic. latter dead virus residue. makes sense post-lockdown. looks familiar March photos. would guy lie like though lmao. pandemic lead death America know it. like 1 percent US citizens infected last two weeks? Imagine know solid one percent chance winning lottery next two weeks. think close life changed forever. thing corona, control chances ""winning"". Honestly loving excuse since I‚Äôm fan majority family. may make staying home holiday thing yearly tradition. 

I got told I‚Äôm bitter political want see love me. haven‚Äôt responded lmao. sure? Social Dilemma

This 100% must-see documentary btw don‚Äôt think people people. Everyone contextualizes covid terms personal risk. simply don‚Äôt care anyone else all. good 30% society way. didn‚Äôt want people know now. cannot compare Thanksgiving (one night feasting giving thanks) Chinese New Year (15 days festivities). chinese new year specific days visit specific households, including elders parent-in-laws. Secondly, open-air markets set Thanksgiving, unlike Chinese New Year. 

There also Chunyun, probably leading factor Covid spread. 40 day period traveling largest migration year. think 50 million Americans traveling Thanksgiving bad, think 385 million Chinese traveling once. individuals traveling home cramped, illegally barely legally traveling make home. sit haphazardly floors enough seats.

As see, Chinese New Year NOTHING comparable Thanksgiving United States. Idiot. People like going takes eternity get back business usual.  Ah yes good ol' Huntington Beach racism capitol California. always heard 2 years. gives? Nothing going collapse. amount money offered travel nurses right now. think warmer weather keeping people outdoors more, honestly thought Florida would fucked both? Interesting data point!

Thanks sharing. That‚Äôs think people miss explain people ‚Äúsocial animals‚Äù can‚Äôt go long isolation. social animals, means case see others living lives normally feel like it‚Äôs safe preferable us too. It‚Äôs we‚Äôve isolated months lot people haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs tend decide behave based people around us doing. maybe asking gratification taking long something that. I've met really batshit extremist Buddhists before. There's ignorance every faith/ interested attending 2500 person concert maskless social distancing contact Victory church Tulsa, OK. recall Tulsa Mayor announced concert anyone came hospital sick would admitted dying would sent home oxygen fend themselves. course Mayor proudly held Trump rally Tulsa, Ok. I'm saying that, even without recirculation, sitting strangers close together multiple hours, probably could infect 4 people. absolutely need lockdown lol Wow. Survival fittest. Isnt Oxford one actually alive monkey? Serious question please dont downvote smart ass. FUCKING $8 ?! THAT'S FUCKING CRIMINAL.


WTF? fucking country pays teachers $8? Imagine 500 60k seat stadiums. One seat winner. bought 150 seats stadium 1.

I'm going local lottery odds. amount stadiums may vary. Pickup thing   wondering would happen 1) vaccine found, 2)produced/distributed, 3) social distancing ends 2025, guess ‚Äúbut wait mutates‚Äù ‚Äúbut there‚Äôs going another wave‚Äù Moderna Pfizer news stopped? Oh, right. need China country's job. Captain Obvious' Fund Obvious Observations, obviously.  mother tried telling us ""covid going meet Thanksgiving"" 3 children told unfortunate. wonder rate acceptance higher among people risk, since might concious gravity situation themselves. imagine easier reject vaccine think nothing bad happen you. People saying everyone get spring summer normal kidding themselves.

Why? summer pretty normal even without vaccine. Cases fraction, deaths basically zero. selfish sister family actually traveling. Really disappointed them. really really hope so. I'm sick entire situation [CDC 11 discusses roll guidance. feel like folk saying respected critically engaged examining understand philosophy apply life, should, can, work help inform wider lexicon topics read.

That is, yes, ""strange,"" strange way someone referencing adding numbers ""reverse subtraction:"" shows gap information, one might easy help fill in. McDonald‚Äôs took bacon egg cheese bagel. pregnant ass happy it. Pretty sure could get them, I‚Äôd keeping local McDonald‚Äôs afloat right now. ‚Äúfearmongers‚Äù really don‚Äôt care live life don‚Äôt want kill people.

Also, pretty funny people want everyone die constantly saying ‚Äúlive life‚Äù. Extremely unironic totally self unaware people here.

We broken country society. people think invisible thoughts important whether somebody else makes next year. didn‚Äôt work half states didn‚Äôt even lock down, people stupid wear masks... in-laws getting together two families two old ladies (great grandmas). made clear aren‚Äôt open feedback decisions. say exist selfish. Period.  Sure comrade.

Oh definitely agree that. fact Clinton work Sanders , lost lot progressive vote Water what? prepare handle things way supposed issue. run citizens actually get sick certain point? Canadians paying insurance know moving goalpost, said thing 3 months ago.

Besides, ""We going turn off, going completely normal. going gradual accrual normality weeks months go by, get well 2021,"" Fauci said.

He saying forever, enough people get vaccinated number become low enough. already walking job would bet many thinking it. news, UK large urban areas full lockdown, regardless virus progression it‚Äôs likely restrictions lifted Christmas period. politicians insist following science times, can‚Äôt wait see scientific advice supports this.  virus exposing flaws system bringing light things always problem. hope serious positive change comes virus memory. think media made seem know sure prevents infection. primary endpoints trial created see could prevent COVID-19 (the disease), prevent infection SARS-CoV-2. 

They can‚Äôt really figure right prevents infection, BioNTech‚Äôs CEO said likely 50-60% chance preventing infection, cases body fighting back, shortens amount time you‚Äôre infectious asymptomatic also makes less infectious would‚Äôve otherwise been. That‚Äôs good news know asymptomatic cases tend R_0 less 0 tend line transmission die don‚Äôt pass someone become symptomatic. Repost something posted two weeks ago.  FedEx UPS experience transporting ultra-cold frozen goods? neighbor donated cutting forest plant food extra serving steak I'm currently eating! I'm totally green! /s Zoom replacement person contact. information coming people often feel depressed zoom calls didnt talk makes feel isolated. Add zoom burnout thing internet right now. Zoom terrible replacement social contact. Terry girl's name. might wear mask, case reinfections, really knows. 

I‚Äôd personally wear mask bc promotes mask wearing generally public. people it, others might considering wearing them. 

Hope family gets okay ‚ù§Ô∏è worked truck yesterday, grilled fabulous food. tired fight end day doubt treatments gotten better. one main concerns reason summer wave less deadly case numbers spread rather concentrated like 4 states. 

I get feeling we're going see hotspots like first wave, hospitals overwhelmed death rate spikes again. think wave higher death infection ratio summer, hope hit ratios saw spring. I‚Äôd concerned I‚Äôm also covid phobic. search CDC‚Äôs Symptom Profiles among Convenience Sample Patients you‚Äôll see rihnoreah (runny nose) shows 50% covid patients average age groups combined. seen [Dan Goodspeed's chart scares me. bunch kamikaze elders. young ones ready die yet? Long term affects? I'm saying observations used. I'm saying reason people lost faith science grok theory put forward, secondary studies done confirm/verify.

Look HCQ. Initial observations promising. public locked onto observations never believed subsequent studies, larger numbers better analysis, important.  

Do see I'm coming from? try coffee.  Silly man. boy. Big difference. Boy would insulting. Man not. seem trouble running money printer farm subsidies corporate welfare. problem small business individual families hurting? reducing severity still reduce R number vaccinated clear virus lot faster? mean really. support idea protests, except recount ones, still think mass gathering 1000s peoples shouldnt allowed. matter cause Crab people way down! knew it! No, we're supposed open order coddle POS wife beaters.

/S case want obvious. top spreaders refuse vaccine, i.e. anti-mask even crowded public places travel cross-country Thanksgiving types. Except humanity evolved communities reason. reason hermits outlier. people cant completely emotional intimacy 9 months. Even greatest feats like pyramids mentioned done large groups people working together widely distributed vaccine, said, go long way bringing back sense normalcy ‚Äì least sense used normal.

tldr: work long possible to. work house cars home retire.  Virtually everyone know spends way us housing cars. I'm going buy $50,000 truck work years it.  facts underreported deaths? would argue anything it‚Äôs reported. tried today would people guns breaking quarantine threatening anyone violence tried stop them.  Bu-hu, I've judged posts without claiming anything person calling names silly boy. Yes Yeah even get voted 2016 4 years could anyone sense decency vote psychopath? also shaves upper management.. bodies office ""manage"".. job ain't needed anymore..

And I'm sorry, fuckers bachelor degrees business going let happen. try 11,12,13. Thank sir this! say much for? I‚Äôm curious. I‚Äôm America can‚Äôt imagine won‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy one early‚Äù option here. facetious. actually 2 7lb hams. Maybe, I‚Äôd monitor see anything else happens.

It‚Äôs time year allergies hit hard, especially weather changing kinda weird. saying it‚Äôs Covid, could also allergies seasonal hay fever shit. working home since March extremely cautious tested positive week. feel like shit never fever (how reliable screening method??)

My question recover finish lockdown able go eat worry getting sick again?  whole family positive right idea maybe getting back normalcy sounds amazing. You‚Äôre exactly right‚Äîwhich need drop smoke &amp; mirror bullshit globally investigate China attack humanity. Stop taking word this... write poetry! Yep, use money fund pandemic response! people reddit dont care mental health feel easy social contact 9 months also can‚Äôt police everyone, time. way effective restrictions people want follow them. 

For case need people 1) understand restrictions. 2) trust authorities 3) economic support makes possible follow restrictions without losing money (for example - pay people keep bar closed).

If people reckless selfish solution short window policing draconian penalties. Can‚Äôt long though, certainly long enough last pandemic. It‚Äôll again, time making people less likely adhere. German loaded dammm, cries American ... flip phone cell phone. That's hot take general consensus Trump got elected nearly everyone disliked Hillary. DNC use super delegates push Bernie Trump would never elected know what‚Äôs really bad physical mental health? Getting coronavirus giving someone care about. Stay hell home. mean new paper, yet peer review, followed nearly 5,000 employees Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, tested repeatedly coronavirus antibodies immune function.

Elon list fatties.  understand people pandemic feel like need go vacation foreign country, dismiss quarantine guidelines etc.

But think message media/state somewhat contradictory: social distance good, makes businesses suffer, think many people justify going bar, going vacation etc. ""It's good economy"", although clear (and made clear media/state) broad view case.

In Finland, Covid basically gone summer, life normal, people brought travels - second wave starting get worse. False negative Yeah. NY March taste come nearly every state finally gave inadequate ways fight virus. feeling matter time every state bad possibly due schools, think around time Florida opening everything new increase cases began climb. Halloween maybe election got growing even more. Thanksgiving probably blow water. Christmas New Years keep afloat.

Hopefully January rest 2021 numbers start falling due people getting vaccine, leaving anti-vaxxers Covid nonbelievers catch virus.  RemindMe! 17 days yet contracted covid

Emphasis *yet*  Wow. guess mom didn‚Äôt teach manners eh? Shame that. subset healthcare interact known positive COVID cases? Divide conquer entitled nation status goes _____? constantly keeps pulling mobs. Even fighting boss wipe. let leader dungeon party, rage quits breaks computer. goes house steals says fault owed new computer took yours. goes twitter rant /u/purpyo effect ""I've never played WoW him, even know guy, heard he's terrible player know heal kept pulling mobs dungeon run broke computer tried say it.""


Big true. vaccines 95% effective. yeah, believe want believe. 70% people I've talked seem understanding expectstion US government actually help time would rather sacrifice machine act like everythings okay everyone know awesome go church flash 20s priest?? gets treatment hospital

**Triage** process determining priority patients' treatments severity condition likelihood recovery without treatment.  


Just add another condition.  flu deadly many thousands. years kills many, treat sick flu crime? Sure, worse elderly, fuck wrong you? I'd bit hesitant air travel indicator travel. 

We saw family times past months. Proper isolation driving made possible us safely. 

In past, would done via flight - right that's far risky. one calling bans we're asking use constitutional right fucking idiot lol. one called ban xenophobic except people calling hoax now. live silly man. 

Couldn't care less live really, really relevant judge quality posts. Man like one bit, I'm stressed work since show shit come saw people protesting california... Maybe get 1 20, Polis add cool new colour dial! I'm think hot pink new purple new red counties red actually anything contain spread. ""Anything bad never happen everything good eventually will."" It'll years effective vaccine released never said wasn‚Äôt...this direct response work home. thankful job...just wish it‚Äôs one allowed leave house could right. didn‚Äôt think possible. anything, Japan shows effective masks are. government aggressive neighboring countries trying contain virus, fact population used wearing masks led epidemic completely swamping country like west. disease likely never fully going away, what's acceptable level death. That's comes to.

Everyone pandemic probably even pay much attention flu shots (I've always pro flu shots) turned big moral blame game something many people likely ignorantly spread leading deaths.

So what's acceptable level societal viral spread? Seems like important question. Along movies entertainment promising ""you"" ""chosen"" one. 

Everyone thinks version Luke/Rey Skywalker... gift universe.

This country needs MASSIVE ego loss.. propose dose everyone.  Jokes them...I think God they'll meeting. family lives within 15 minutes travel. know within last five days, 20% coworkers received positive results. work healthcare. I'm actually feeling safer around remaining masked coworkers unmasked family, volunteered Thursday. 

*Come grab food work!* one knows long immunity lasts, possible get different strain (probably). I've heard people postulating 3 months, 6 months.

I pretty cautious, got COVID got better I'd probably riskier next months. I'd still wear mask I'd things normally outside risk tolerance, like eat restaurant, maybe see movie (if that's still thing), go stores grocery store, things like that. 3 rd line. Frontline healthcare essential workers, immune compromised, elderly believe. way enough vaccines available vaccinate short time. look number vaccines promised available end 2021 look many people planet. US going get vaccines afford it. Realistically best stay home. Schools closed everything else open ? universe ? Hilarious. many deaths ok with???

No. that's problem.

By Chinese standards, Cuomo would sacked end March people would asking head. USA somehow hailed hero fighting pandemic. difference standards appalling. minimal symptoms (no fever. slight cough) worried passing went Dr tested positive. advice inkling idea may get tested caution. 

 pretty sick working glad took action did.  know take care people rest world alright... planes, drones, missiles, helicopters... Yeah Atlantic bubble holding steady. good Probably, they're still traveling across country. scary. Happy hear made it. Stay safe take care. They‚Äôve within 10-20% actual number total us deaths since first couple incorrect predictions though 

They‚Äôre gotten remarkably good predicting whole time? think mean deep fry... People perfectly capable setting priorities I‚Äôm sure understood article  may offer longer lasting immunity natural infection, know yet. Personally, I'd infection, would probably still get vaccinated though that's based immutable truth scientific fact. Exactly. People hit partners children legitimately believe okay so.

That's never ""lose control"" hit boss, mom angry.

Eastern culture traditionally group-mindset style thinking, sacrificing personal liberties greater good people. Thus long leaders educated care people, everyone mostly fine crisis. also keep mind COVID East's first time rodeo, since they've deal pandemics recent memory, like SARS. 

In contrast, Europeans Americans independent free culture, emphasizing personal liberties, freedoms expression. also never recent major pandemics due quality health care that's provided countries. this, really need educate people leaders uniform response needed, otherwise people feel less inhibited whatever hell want. That's America performed poorly compared Europe NZ.  fair guy house guy going house January old dirt probably hard guess we‚Äôll find out, sadly. extended unemployment runs weeks. make 100,000 month.

JHU reporting Case Fatality Rate (CFR), deaths per ***known*** case.

The Infected Fatality Rate (IFR) unknown know many cases are, know we're catching all. Last CDC estimate US hear 0.65%, though ago. skewed toward older people pre-existing conditions.

Not 0.65% great, 80% people eventually got COVID we'd looking 1.7 million dead it. sure want that. Teletherapy work many people. Therapy core based connection lose that. Alot counselors caseloads plummeted since going teletherapy thst reason. Also vast majority therapists performing teletherapy trained it. Purity fluids! 10,000 deaths per day seem far fetched giving people going about. say ‚Äúeveryone boat,‚Äù people cared ‚Äúeveryone,‚Äù they‚Äôd already trying mitigate spread covid. They‚Äôre protesting don‚Äôt care anything anyone except short-sighted self-interest. got vaccinated virus still traveling home Thanksgiving Christmas. I'm going spread anything get sick. 100% agree mask wearing. continue wear mask it‚Äôs right thing do. (And it‚Äôs law live)

I know lot different studies varying opinions immunity really want go eat beer haven‚Äôt done since March. First thing first, need recover lockdown passing someone would absolutely terrible. 

This disease sucks really realize it‚Äôs dangerous. wife, two kids got within 24 hours it‚Äôs extremely contagious. one house fever yet would missed screening. didn‚Äôt sick pay could see would logic fever = I‚Äôm fine work true. 

The media even come close hyping illness. It‚Äôs joke. want say hard shutdown never happen, I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre getting closer closer point something definitely needs happen businesses basically need stay open due help government won‚Äôt *anyone* coming stores they‚Äôre sick probably hospital! business customers money RIP. 

Or could go hardcore masks social distancing actually enforce stuff people wearing masks crowding around. gets dicey private Thanksgiving gatherings true spreaders. would police stop big gatherings happening (maybe even families) one? forcibly stop place littered cars? kindly ask everyone get mask least get tested after? feels weird thinking ways stop big Thanksgivings nearly everyone one go one.

Then got thing Christmas New Years. every college shutting week reopening late January.  kids get home somehow morally questionable position justify largely preventable deaths column pointing less deaths column B.

This line thinking nullifies ""they would died year anyway"" deaths substantial group people vulnerable covid. mean 80 years old, probably 15% chance die within 12 months covid not.

In month April way excess rate... heading back now. Something like 8% everyone died Sweden year died Covid-19.

In end day, wish well. Swedes generally wonderful people except ex girlfriend... even Swedish aunt :) Go source data graph add Austria list....doesn‚Äôt make look great. 

The way it‚Äôs presented makes UK look worse ‚ÄòEurope‚Äô. would know? scientist taught science government schools lived number years UK Thailand, certain scientific knowledge average Briton substantially greater average Thai. What's interesting fact benefited UK pandemic. Living Thailand now, apparent Thais respect trust scientists, teachers doctors. much due differences science education versus general cultural differences pretty much impossible distinguish.

Please note talking Thailand specifically, government school class may double number students compared UK class, teaching practices well known highly outdated. believe ""West"" educated ""East"". Thanks highlighting these. I'll read article entire now. Thx :) dad code /s clear, online classes. locked online content system students live campus person classes.

This result repeated refusals abide random testing protocol designed limit spread. That's even minimum wage live. That's deplorable! Wait? Trump fascist want Biden send troops arrest people? literally COVID right Mom still asked coming Thanksgiving.

Thankfully, supposed me, her, two step-father's kids, truly mind boggling question. Remind me! 17 days   &amp;#x200B;

I'd love give credit brilliance certain political systems, hard see Australia Canada different, geography.

Could island shares protective factor rest hemisphere? Possibly similar much less pathogenic virus circulated Eastern hemisphere, offering up-to-now unmeasured (probably T-cell) immunity, (well-considered implemented) measures enough keep R less one. 

In western hemisphere, major substantial factor correlating decreased disease population density, almost irrespective public policy. Even Germany can't hold point. someone remove American brains replace shit? high mask compliance places, outbreaks often happened dining, drinking household environments. Wonder cases Spain Italy came from. First all: think caught it? event come mind? 

Secondly: yes, temperature screening unreliable. think terms low hanging fruit.

Lastly, no: can‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre immune recover it. must continue wearing mask socially distancing. Even couldn‚Äôt get sick could still spread others might get sick. need draft, public don‚Äôt consider war worth fighting. public don‚Äôt consider war worth fighting, don‚Äôt need draft.

The government serve people according priorities. People voting feet. liability restaurant must go roof, right?

If someone dines there, gets covid die (and traced restaurant), must able sue restaurant owner personally everything have.  think author understood situation. students locked course management system (CMS), used online person classes alike. students see grades, take quizzes, get readings, etc. Didnt Australia completely shut region like week ago. ""It is"" F poor guy. must one unluckiest souls. cousin due baby December. I'm worried labor hallway. 20 million doses administered strategically could significant effect mortality morbidity. would also say seeing international travel folks living U.S. families abroad want cross borders still can, long conditions currently applied. happens coincide w.

As someone lost family another country manage end life care funeral arrangements via zoom, nothing exasperating despairing. narrative less ""this never happen us"" ""well, obviously going harm kill us, least geographical location file paperwork efficiently?"" Ive also seen old folks spiraling horrible isolation induced depression. kills. Idk...I always thought choice black white. crying phone theyre lonely theyve lost much well. 

In short: :( PCR. I‚Äôll pass authoritarianism. So... Introvert?

I get it. routine change much, except going out. I'm loving it. tabloid newspapers Sky news. Well, that's weird, that's applying logic (instinct) evenly.

The mindset that: unlikely things *can* happen.

So, give luck lottery draw chance, dive luck covid short straw chance.

I same, though take chances lottery tune 10 dollars per year.  almost restrictions begging june begging october... thats reason stuck shit chin travelling enjoying. Wear mask follow proper hygiene enjoy! There's need sit home. Sadly sizable anti-mask movement Spanish Flu alluded states actually fined arrested so. key difference imo. Except social isolation mean time immediate family unless live them. actually means cut family. people work home seeing zero people day. ways similar new moms struggle they've suddenly lost adult contact us. Nimrods Paris. US get paid $5 Walgreens gift card getting flu shot. It‚Äôs nice. can‚Äôt imagine living like that....it‚Äôs horrifying. America needs start working taking care citizens better....I pity anybody stuck USA right now.

This agree with. USA far generous dollars taking care rest world. Time bring dollars back home. CDC website America gonna ride covid bomb 50 million sure made 1945.. atleast remade WFH always option, sooner get rid masks, distancing, capacity limits, forced shutdown hours, better.

I mean Egypt trying discuss keeping shops cultural areas unified shutdown hour 12 am, go 1 summer. hope doesn‚Äôt go through. Global survival rate. I've also done two in-person job interviews dentist visit, maintaining distance remaining masked whole time.

You dentist visit remaining masked whole time? must've made teeth cleaning difficult!

Actually, I'm debating going dentist end year get least use dental insurance. I've done routine health appointments dentist seems riskier since can't masked whole time. I'd imagine manufacture, distribute administer thing remain cranked max. last 10 words comment reinforces article, not?

And, choose take approach climate change, for?

The storm recently live hundred year type thing likely see worse next 5 years point hands individual countries EU tied, maybe union wide elimination bordered outside could've worked, i'm sure EU legality there.

Well people back pretty much said exact thing said. Yeah, he's manipulating market. possibly smoking reefer. stay shithole die US avoid spreading virus countries pay less taxes US need pay health insurance top it. . . Never said fact. nature original comment opinion respect. doesn‚Äôt need labeled Chinese data probably reliable American data year. problem beginning year paying attention (you don‚Äôt seem so) know almost every single state (especially Florida) blatantly lies everyone state coronavirus, designing system count cases possible weird school regulations prevent notified child exposed.

So yeah Chinese data suspect? American data known lies. Factually wrong information, rigged politicians, it‚Äôs even secret! Yet people like pretend like it‚Äôs happening. dumb, country. dumb. No, course not. GOP DEATH CULT source Chinese food distribution Wuhan lockdown. worked China, country much poorer per capita us. reason work here.


Uhh....that sound like working districts even begun regulate group delivery services, prohibiting supermarkets selling individuals forcing communities buy groceries bulk. Even neighborhood group order food, Wuhan residents complained quality price produce delivered. David Dai, resident lives outskirts Wuhan, told AFP onions tomatoes neighbors ordered arrived rotten. said forced throw third food.
However, grocery stores communities struggling fill increasing number orders begun set minimum order requirements delivery. one supermarket required minimum 30 orders, another store allowed 1,000 delivery orders per day, AFP reported.

They got preselected thing groceries many even good. Heaven forbid kid different needs allergies eating disorder.  age thing.

Ah! May ask old are? ignorance kind seems like ignorance comes experience actual world. say disparage young people (I'm 37 btw), many smarter many areas. fantasy land scenarios shocking lack ability admit putting people danger serve reeks life inexperience. saving gas money picking groceries? still drive grocery store. think even reading posts. 

Good god, even tipping extra? assumed going places less, spending money normal things might buy stores, thus saving money...but whatever. That, fact seem herd immunity common cold, flu. think going work better covid? don‚Äôt believe independent media outside Singapore would agree you.

I agree, even Singapore lot people agree me. That‚Äôs good point!  said Corona virus panic dumb.

He said kids essentially immune.

He said take vaccine comes out. 

Also podcast, Musk argued instead sweeping stay-at-home orders mitigate spread coronavirus, ""anyone risk quarantined storm Swisher confronted Musk possibility people would still die process,¬†he replied bluntly: ""Everybody question what, balance, serves greater good,"" Musk continued, adding lockdowns accomplish pandemic ""no-win situation.""

He seems simplistic/superficial view really match facts. probably stick fields expertise least take time understand problem better. Right! could negative test come contact someone positive way home test they‚Äôre infected. good initial negative test standpoint protecting classroom full people? add it‚Äôs online classes makes even less sense. instructions bag online even Turkey Bags package use one those.
 small turkeys, turkeys breasts, pre-cooked hams pop oven foil set timer. Vegetables cans plop bowl microwave.stuffing box pretty easy.

 try making meal afford it. Noone around laugh judge screw up. One obvious remote work. Many companies terrified perceived lack control allow employees work home remotely, forced big trial run. companies, like Microsoft, already said remote work remain permanent option.

I think may benefits larger political/societal shifts (as well negatives!), gets much abstract assessments value speculation trends. Good sheep last time heard someone faith, preaching Tahiti farming mangoes. means two options shutdown starve death don‚Äôt. third option. 

This asinine Agree this. Pacific region well. Stupid stupid  got deal Kroger. Grabbed smallest one could find, 22 lbs. Thought hoax? ""The CDC run expect every Governor utmost control spread. We've got virtual war room mobilise resources stay top this.""

Nah. *Golf*. problem is, people last long all. people ever get reinfected. fall somewhere between. 

Biology messy inexact. matter much data have, individual cannot say lie spectrum. travelling to? Different parts US? never go store still caught it. Terrible article. Pacific region well includes western style countries.. Japan mostly lucky far (following western model) Korea vigilant, China extreme New Zealand top level. Iceland, Greenland islands. TL;DR: Magic, can't explain.

If even ""evil China care lives"" care successfully lives do, what's printed 2020 merit badge? ""Participated successfully""? Well me, american, heritage foundation United States. family fought revolution. literally gave lives freedom enjoy today respect that. Individual freedom worth preserving cost. Unfortunately let education system go shit people unable discern right wrong anymore. made right decisions rely nanny state, didnt reaping sew. Revoke operating license. Bruh need take look map. 40% Asia‚Äôs residents considered Asian according whatever hell definition Asians is? 

Also, although India didn‚Äôt well Australia NZ, per capita scale they‚Äôre relatively well compared western Europe America. manage bring number active cases 1 million less 500k, hopefully trajectory remains thats way. I'm Illinois. imagine places high compliance stray face told firmly mask up. places majority people dgaf, workers would spending time enforcing rules angry people. guess live. ICU full still HOAX TYRANNY. flight leaves Tuesday...can‚Äôt wait fun, relevant. USA *uncontrolled spread* right travel mean spread. 

Random stats countries times really count. also effectively island.

Canada closed border US, millions still cross month. currently helping remodel home woman four kids. kids sent home ""contact tracing"" makes nervous working there, keep distance. 
But thing I'm concerned (and kids) still go places run errands.
 walk nearby park see kids. went library school book. go shopping home decor.
Isn't someone sent home contact tracing (proximity someone covid making transmission risk) supposed self isolate quarantine? going places? working house? Course correction food service workers delivery workers get sick, already know they're calling sick work bills pay   Social media, Fox News, certain media outlets offer unsubstantiated opinion, rather substantiated fact. us realize reading Facebook Reddit. Problem is, many folks don‚Äôt realize watching CNN, MSNBC, Fox, etc. funny we've never done immediate gratification experiment. See happens offer benefit taking marshmallow early. wonder many people would still delay. bad $15 make flipping burgers local fast food restaurants NY. EMT really paid low? *shitty, poorly regulated, dysfunctional capitalism lacking well-run civic institutions. Stupid stupid does. make worse rest us staying home. Pisses right off. even justify flying anywhere gd pandemic? Ask worth sit together eat dryest bland food ever find someone family (or you) covid -- feel? Cancel travel plans stay home. european brand? Bullshit new wealth Chinese might buy Technocrats say

Good. thing worse politician know they're technocrat like Neil Ferguson also know they're doing, thinks do. Germany getting 100 million doses, government special deal them. lump Canada USA HUGE difference wrt virus managed countries. Current USA Gov give shit Canada, care trying resulting way less deaths many east countries. TLDR: catastrophic chaotic failure leadership President personally appointed team sycophants cultists. even lulls? mean, ""wave"" peaks troughs. Buhbye, Christmas 2020. see people would‚Äôve failed Marshmallow Test. I'm staying home. see say that. 

Excessive death shows general trend country's death rate. important seeing different countries coping pandemic overall. always worth remembering countries different ways recording many died Corona, sometimes hide true Corona death toll (e.g. USA). Another thing worth remembering Corona effect people actually catching virus. parts society negatively affected mean even people dies recorded Corona casualty (could important surgey happen, possibly suicides due long isolation, etc.). Thank God Florida see one state license car plate. It‚Äôs getting Molotov Cocktailed therapeutics much impact Rt vaccination will? Full hazmat suit respirator still dick nosing. Come China, much better !! Thank you! throw loaded words accurately describe sentiment, instead verbal hand grenades argument.""

Just like ""Glorious Leader"" Xi, capacity handle criticism added name Constitution making criticism treason, also thin skin cannot take even mild criticism without getting ultra defensive. shows weak are, fragile. 

I criticize country shortcomings missteps frequently. also criticize President. without ending trouble law? massive chip weak shoulder doubt even get guts say anything negative, even felt it, self-conscious identity. would cool able display something changing. 

Maybe percent change cases positive per 100,000 last 14 days vs stat two weeks ago month ago. 


Very nice visualization. words. People refuse wear mask following procedures keep EVERYONE healthy main reason still shit hole! two good sides. say is, maybe. people give meaning dates way add breaks relentlessness life. humans manage working day day weekends holidays disrupt monotony give something look forward to. 

plus people selfish cant 'normal routine' interrupted. kinda ironic value soybeans tracked like gold buy currency world soybeans currency (well base nations payment system is) no. commodities (traded exchanges form futures derivates). might different definition currency currency face value. 20‚Ç¨ gold coin currency 20‚Ç¨ even value commodity gold might 500‚Ç¨. need lockdown never places *anyways.* One deeper problems states *did* lockdown influx people states *didn't* lockdown disregarded rules. Colorado instance parks effectively state shut traveling state parks refused follow procedures different came from.

If one thing I've learned US people disregard even basic rules slight difference convenience. like two seconds find credible article debunking it. Like seriously. first lockdown fine, people listened, every consecutive lockdown larger larger amounts population fed lockdowns.

They need make sure lockdown dont another. Obviously cut much red tape possible, time savings phase 3 waiting people catch virus. Pfizer example gave like 20k people vaccine 20k placebo, needed wait 100 people got covid look data first time. hit much sooner rare disease control. Turns uncontrolled community spread several countries cuts time significantly. lead watching clips youtube link videos far right conspiracies. much worse Fox. Pfizer says they‚Äôll distribute using supply chain. Maybe startup like Moderna use 3rd party help more. least people traveling get sick die. Karma Darwin always offer little light dark times. Colo fairly well early outbreak fairly wide spread response. One interesting parts exploded nearly fast areas country well. might thought would slower upswing due lower amount transmission summer. personal theory person schooling making lower initial seeding, that's speculation. idiots still ""stay home"" shit ü§£ scared getting sick stay home people pussies continue living life? ü§î Healthcare worker here, I‚Äôm feeling Covid burn out/ fatigue HARD past weeks I‚Äôm one. Unfortunately mental health cut part time hours within next two weeks, best nurse put notice, several others working finding remote jobs something non related medical field. pandemic literally making us want recluse inside homes, get bed. really hard think I‚Äôm Maine shit starting hit fan. Thank though caring happens us, bearing witness. one appreciate it, sincerely. Tight tight ‚Äúwhat aboutism‚Äù isn‚Äôt viable excuse. Personal responsibility paramount people hardly even trying heed cautions US talking America, yes? 



Not another country different set governing rules, right? place example people actually trust government/respect them/listen and/or simply follow orders told to? 


Lockdowns good - long essential workers serve population. Someone take fall right? 

Thats point. Totally agree. covid worked administrative assistant medical office. I've heard people say easy job anyone could it. I'd say probably 75% clinicans know work scheduling system much less property maintain multiple schedules time. socially awkward know take phone calls. job pays slightly minimum wage mean everyone it. feel hard. Governor state banned gatherings 10 more, wife's family tirade hates thanksgiving. decided concede cancel Thanksgiving. return, since they're going get see everyone thanksgiving, they're throwing brunch today invited people would thanksgiving. holiday problem 30+ people confined space. RemindMe! 17 days need sacrifice it, need mature it, difficult engage tele-health learn new strategies management techniques work maturing it.

I get lot people reaching I'm always open mental health struggles work them. great able help friends acquaintances resources, crazy little people know mental health sometimes.  adults treat basic first aid home illness small wave anxiety mild depressed mood understanding what's going strategy dealing it. Sure, total floozies, really, need mental health education sensitivity country badly. thing, cancelled xmas flight Florida. Airlines making really easy got voucher full refund rebook. going stay father's country club banned outside visitors coming entire neighborhood. everyone absolutely insists visiting family bookend travel two weeks quarantine negative test result, would far better spot, wonder percentage travelers actually that. inconvenient impossible people, im sure many fib cautious theyve been. take care. says catching determined factors degree and/or frequency exposure it?  what? 200 300 people crowd? another news source desperate sell views giving exposure selfish segment population. truth everybody drastically different opinions three major delivery services, depending local distributor drivers.

I know UPS driver. He‚Äôll put package front porch. USPS driver used pull next garage drop packages ground without getting vehicle. new USPS driver likes drop ‚Äúsorry missed you‚Äù slips mailbox without walking doorbell. pretty worried coronavirus, day wear mask carry hand sanitizer. don‚Äôt let kids open doors touch things store, said work healthcare. long term care facility. clients usually MR along several ailments. current client Covid, late forties, type 1 diabetic, hypertension, epilepsy, autism, MR. he‚Äôs fine.

Flu deaths printed every day, we‚Äôd freaking too. vaccines didn‚Äôt entire global science community working towards goal. slowed red tape held slow process bureaucracy. steps skipped ensure safety, streamlined given top priority submission review Ahh nice, Twitter thread.

If want disprove national strategy need lot someone's social media post. I'm happy. you? Really shouldn‚Äôt Biden dance parties, huh?

2 weeks later numbers aren‚Äôt good.... really agree that. pretty much going work. Beyond doing, choice. People getting sick around left right, still hear folks saying virus big deal. That's lack leadership pushing narrative pretend away. Leadership must take responsibility mixed messaging amount personal accountability correct damage done. horse! That's awesome kid major heart surgery birth. shit coagulated blood throwing clots creeps fuck out. everyone look situation. suffer precautions take now. Tomorrow better day everyone . 


Edit: ""Tomorrow "" mean next year possibly summer.  Yes. Like people complaining Gavin Newsom going eat friends setting good example, sure maybe money test everyone hand virus doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre celebrity politician rich. makes vulnerable getting it. Like west wing outbreak. analogy it‚Äôs picking steam let alone getting tired. Wow. population doesn‚Äôt care Right women aren‚Äôt hitting anyone either. foreclosure eviction protections set expire lockdowns begin unemployment rises, Winter Coming... Imagine millions newly homeless people seeking shelter virtual petri dishes spread virus continues break records millions lose health insurance... could looking beginning end America First World nation. Biden get blame happen watch even though McConnell block even half-assed relief measures. worst yet come. Mexico look good comparison dust settles. Yes many parents story. Housing education crazy expensive wages gone 25 years frugal longer effective lifestyle used be. Millennials trying go far can't build wealth. won't. Covid-19 magically ""forgotten"" obscured like 1918 ""Spanish"" flu. live age selective history half-truths. Go visit ""death pits"" El Paso's ICU's get back one. Doubtful. mine alot others around US.

Check USTRANSCOM (US Transportation Command). one highest level combatant command vitally important, yet never get recognition. suspect involved. Giving medical treatment sick emotional  Okay. Even 0.2% significant enough change anything. No, not. SpaceX employees dataset. Bringham Woman's Hospital, MIT, Broad Institute bunch research institutions Boston conducted study.  I‚Äôve noticed too. mentioned US Gov basically ran economy 4 years. Everyone essentially worked government 4 years. didn‚Äôt believe me, didn‚Äôt even realize talking WWII. Man, can‚Äôt wait beer public totally feel comfortable. 

I‚Äôll pour pbr family! stupid everyone else. make risk profile, general agree legally prevented able it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But still, bar ""survive""? enough health concerns already? funny thing thst supply chain hasnt even impacted likely wont. still shortage panic buying. self fulfilling prophecy many people. I‚Äôm dropping food zooming dinner. taking risk meeting. big family dinner died last year original host became ill it. üòî im sorry. feel grateful family understand risks sensible. cant imagine frustrating must be, especially live mercy decisions. take care üß° lie literally look dashboard??? Hospitals full. 

[Missouri comment means nothing. wouldn‚Äôt expect someone disagrees science . take shitty government, people advocating life saving measures. insane? money easily give corporations rich people instead. watch speech, would guess combination positive tests, positivity rate, hospitalization rate, statistical models based them. seem keeping track things months ago anyway. definitely margin error, fairly scary even actual % bit one way other. : ( going home parents old, literally could go time. mom low grade cancer fighting. normally see twice year, I‚Äôve forgone visiting last year due COVID. don‚Äôt see soon, I‚Äôm afraid never again.

I‚Äôve quarantining best possible, taken COVID test get results back day leave. I‚Äôm also going driving Indiana California car see them, plan stay around 5 weeks.

I feel like I‚Äôm impossible situation. say capitalist companies sell unhealthy food society willing consume, agree. Also proud admit maybe bodies fat.  Chad oil? Maybe need freedom too?!?

Ps - signed American laugh self Depends whats considered ‚Äúright‚Äù considers it...But yeah. riot family houses, fine. addition EUA, also there‚Äôs limited number doses. Plenty others would lining first shipment. honest question re: holiday travel I'm hoping people help work through.

I live New York City. plan right drive Baltimore spend Thanksgiving brother gf. 3 us, plus dog cats. basically leave apartment grocery shop walk dog. left New York total since pandemic started, visit couple months ago. I've gotten tested, PCR antibody, times always come back negative. I've following Covid guidelines strictly, always wear mask outdoors around 6 people since like February. 

The fact is, feel pretty isolated lonely times. good friends bubble circle left city, either holidays longer, tough expensive here. Dating hard unsuccessful. live working remotely. Basically I've zero human interaction, days blending together quite time now. Since like 9 hours daylight now, extremely, extremely depressing.

Am something wrong traveling? understand general bad idea, think part reason people people need that. mean, never thought would last long (and last longer), think definitely new set lockdowns curb spread...I know much isolation really take given feels like nobody else really trying hard. privacy concerns, location morgue disclosed.

All conspiracy theorists see catch car crash someone got hit yesterday? wrong you?  think entire world situation blatantly shown decidedly case. person knows what's going on. Even people know super concerned getting tested going visit family. know anyone cancelling visits girlfriend got email hospital week ago stating potentially vaccinated mid-December. Here‚Äôs hoping one biggest concerns drag virus home get sick. 

Her coworkers dropping like flies wave. spring not. 

There also quite bit healthcare staff quitting thinking quitting. discussed quitting well, told quit second wants to. support vaccine. 

I don‚Äôt think general public knows dangerously close losing healthcare workers. 

Simply put. Nurses sick shit. would‚Äôve solution, US group people find unacceptable. call socialism, government making people lazy, completely stupid idea. somehow cling idea work hard you‚Äôre there‚Äôs something morally wrong you. buying antivax anything. going observe bit see goes. likely much choice. friend got positive test last week. thing spend time people lives neighbour's flat. 
One decided drive parents days later took test that, make sure infect parents. 
He symptoms. Positive. 
Now got tested positive mild/ symptoms. Goes show fast shit spread without even knowing it. 
They mid 20s probably fine, one actually works elderly people. Well one dude probably would've infected whole family, take test make sure. 
Stay save people. ^ Found sheep. specifically refers fact want wear mask posts though, literally every day. empathy people actively encouraging others something simple putting mask, insane number cases now. Remember earlier together stuff?....its bs point. Wife feel like family,friends public whatever want. Well said. Exactly. dunno, really fat people can't get close ACE receptors nose mouth whatnot stomach butt prevent getting close.  Smoking, prohibition covid precautions show certain percent people refuse follow common sense. Western countries dont control right now. isnt US thing wont effect though til actually know someone, late. Right many us nameless statistic makes hard people relate don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going way. They‚Äôd push 40 million doses 40 million different patients, plan 40 million 2nd dose 28 days.

They aren‚Äôt going shelve half doses reserve people. hate fucking country morons share Driving by, dropping food off, zooming dinner. Well educate then. Everything read fastest vaccine market like 3 years. some, probably hope society abides masks around time won‚Äôt bad. others, probably want see loved ones person last time they‚Äôve heard horror stories people stuck ICU able visitors. got batch doesn‚Äôt give fuck say show must go on. They‚Äôll say old get sick die everyone else gets mild cases.

It‚Äôs really sad gatherings super spreader events rather probably following protocols airports, plane, businesses. house, depends rules house they‚Äôll super spreader not. better nothing though, agree that?  I‚Äôm instacart shopper. I‚Äôm stores day every day. Haven‚Äôt got Covid thank goodness. vigilant. hear cougher mile away often left store gotten numerous arguments antimaskers. They‚Äôre scum earth. deliver elderly people time wave windows. tell they‚Äôre terrified catching Covid brain dead antimaskers don‚Äôt give fuck people. seriously HATE them. Well explains crucifixes garlic work. Anyone remember movie 12 Monkeys? pointed countries obvious need.

Yeah. you‚Äôre hellbent working Germany, you‚Äôll right. great life, you‚Äôll always roof head food (and beer) fridge.

You won‚Äôt far people minimum wage, tbh, problem. Keep well safe. Happy Holidays. :) think even rejoicing someone don‚Äôt like whose opinions don‚Äôt support gets sick dies pretty evil. evil people sides. could too.  much would cost? 

Who pay it?

We 27,277,837,000,000 debt. I‚Äôm interested. 

What happens doesn‚Äôt work? Good you. district mandates access YouTube way block access it. can‚Äôt even block router since sign district go district‚Äôs vpn. many people last christmas, might well make good one.  problem know exposed. Same. issues airports. find hard believe OP exaggerating. unfortunely stupidity also kill innocent people Selfish dumb seem appropriate. Big cities Texas literally won‚Äôt let inside store without mask. Idk fuck sub keeps getting idea nobody wearing mask. negative hell time. sub awful mental health. get retested? road taking, it, make n95s available. least give us tools arm ourselves. American hypocrisy arrogance great it. Constant attacks lies media politicians China, Americans stupid, arrogant careless people, yet media barely calls it. Car accidents cause 3,000 deaths per day. get rid cars together tbh. driving hours 9-5 roads busiest. figured available national guard doctors nurses already jobs hospitals. sounds like robbing Peter pay Paul. 

Active duty personnel would good option. I'm curious many available across country? They'll demand short order. can't fire democratically elected president. work way.

But rest...yes right Hope well fully recovered That's weird. I've 3 airports seen single person without mask. 2 international airports, big chicago. feel like lot places US huge lack cheap street food. solve death yet. ok explain hundreds thousands people protested streets It‚Äôs evil knowingly brazenly risk someone‚Äôs life possibly life-threatening illness? Sounds pretty evil me... That's frustrating part. know north American attitude, like everyone decided done 6 months nothing further. Yeahhhhh that‚Äôs gonna happen lmao. lockdown worked supposed worked everyone figured waste time waste economy. Equivalent wearing seatbelt you‚Äôve never accident. we‚Äôre well beyond point already locked again, like Europe already done, nobody wants pull trigger again. I'd agree thst. They're gullible ignorant. read things online support idea thst masks dont work. I've never felt evil No, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre evil yeah Bill Gates cause he‚Äôs first line get vaccine üôÑ simply made comment said K@ren got auto deleted bot. covid deadly virus movie people would start wearing masks. TLDR. evil. wife means go elsewhere good selection countries could move pursued it. well do, even us big undertaking. talked though option table. 

I would prefer see change country like kid mom use tell hang Tommy bad influence. Well politicians bad influence people live here. stir pot ""keep base fired up"". Change starts top. Politicians need changed out. need politicians work people like claim TV ads. 

My wife, English, said politicians would never seen second term many allowed finish first. dont hold politicians accountable. senate leader Senate since 6 years old... I'M FORTY FUCKING TWO!!!! WTF!!! keep electing office?WHY?

I feel like even puppies smarter us. eventually stop falling trick like ""dude, know throw ball!"" us though, take running every time panting "" it?!?! it?!?!"" 

We need stop letting politicians divide us, need start hold accountable matter political beliefs are. ok different views them. Push ones common instead demanding switch views. less time waste. vote anything. 

We also REALLY need get rid DNC/RNC. fact dont need political parties all. Political parties cancer make easy people power money influence entire groups leaders. 

Its lot fix country. Let's say screw move New Zealand. Kiwis nice sane. might well neighbors sharing nightmare. Two weeks now....our healthcare workers walk out. hope. state got national guard. enough, always request help active duty personal. Sounds like actually either would rather find nurses people last thanksgiving. paid $13 two turkeys. first one 12 ‚Äúlbs $10. second one $3 11 lbs mean, Contagion really crazy idea, decent prediction world would react pandemic. expect toilet paper flying shelves people resistant wearing masks / social distancing. Remember statement unfortunate get intubation tube shoved throat.

Starting hear it, feel shake ground... going nightmarish, stay safe everyone, swap air anyone outside tiny bubble... lots love, stay safe, stay sane We‚Äôll also able learn look possible viruses future may similar. ya know what, might try  like point fact federal lack leadership means lockdown useless. Piecemeal, one state week, one state next week, Alabama lock Georgia already reopen, etc. Everyone's efforts totally wasted, even people followed everything asked them. Pick n save ftw would make sense westmoreland bombing China, Vietnam. Can't trust guy two first names. This. peak projected right around inauguration Yep, saw news that. wanted make clear head treatment lagging behind prevention. Sure, I've heard theoretically can't contact virus digestive tract Springfield, CoxHealth add nearly 150 beds next weeks, equivalent mid-sized hospital, said Dr. Shawn Usery briefing Friday. However, said, needs staff care patients fill added space, KYTV ‚ÄúWe currently looking across United States find nurses help care patients,‚Äù said.

Maybe. sound like first option. Perhaps military large number extra ICU nurses available. I‚Äôm gonna pick rotisserie chicken &amp; make mashed potatoes probably Bro think would rather stay home. crazy. miss part get paid stay home? Look leadership. 
That's answer Actually, post-Christmas New Years supposed worse. peak fall/winter surge projected right around inauguration Lemme know want get together Skype. tested positive ~9 days initial contact, still negative 7 days. 

For don‚Äôt know yet: incubation period 14 days. could symptomatic &amp; contagious ~14 days, possibly longer. Schools places children LEARN! mean ... debate centuries. ‚Äúschool child care facilities BS‚Äô coming from?!? different, back ppl aware danger, many masked know distance travelers least needed leader.. one.. get real leader 2021.

The last 4 years complete dogshit; tax cuts wealthy, tariff war, worst unemployment rate 80 years, quarter million (preventable) deaths, impeachment, peak racial division dog whistling, regression trans rights LGBTQIA+ rights, travel ban ""muslims"", families separated border lost - joke presidential term.  Johns hopkins American University. obviously biased towards America lol lost 50 pounds once, game Ahhhh yes. encompassing ‚Äúmedium essential places‚Äù. Pretty weird you‚Äôre carving job yourself. Cargo would almost positively fall one well defined categories, unless getting cargo essential supplies people. 

While fun. one tell stay home stay away family. make decisions own, live consequences. want managed government ran Donald, go it. people young (babies/small children) -- know cutoff age use Astrazeneca vaccine tested age 5-12. people immune disorders, risk allergic shot ingredients, undergoing chemotherapy, actively serious illness. can't get new infections everyone infected, guess following Asia's success would mean putting burden COVID response onto government citizens. Yeah think mental gymnastics might‚Äôve worn lol  thought airports requiring masks?  Dude ass first much coronavirus test?  total disregard healthcare workers. hope walk go strike Thank you. live right next Springfield, read headline thinking, ‚ÄúWhich one?!‚Äù Asian countries kept borders closed kept travel restrictions, EU countries US never really worthwhile restrictions travel. Well wife still traveling New Years. Going Dallas, driving. Renting house friends Cali friends live Texas. hated going airport before. Can't imagine now. Well, promising treatment, Regeneron antibody cocktail given President given emergency use authorization FDA. Maybe cheap relative ideology. west, apparently life cheap relative cash. Rapid tests notoriously unreliable, studies say 50% false negative Actually right after, says anticipate ""air travel fall 2.4 million 4.58 million last year"". curious define ""travel"" 50 million number.

Tbh shall know stuff exactly novel English speaking world :) sub massive boner IMHE model predicts doom gloom. cancellation fees? You, too!! lost job (3rd time pandemic I've let go) even want live more, I'm tired going jobs lift system puts us down. feel shame well, wanna american anymore... literally one ways China dealt covid, setting food pickup points

You're gonna show source that, cause find it.
I found shows horible delays China here. shows China's existing home delivery infrastructure helped delivery, nothing food pickup points. doubt nationwide fucking fast food employees

This even make sense? opposed this? Drive thru food exactly saying want grocery would simple matter restructuring parking lot line cars circle pickup point, arranging pickups appointment.

Simple, yeah, right. think big city like Toronto, mcuh people would want order, limited stock would be. Think much line Tim Fucking hortons random weekday morning, think three times many people trying time grocery pick ups. Seriously, grocery stores become pickup only, people figure out

Good plan. way think representative western nation

Your way thinking insane impossible. trying show stay home, people put risk bring shit. hard admit? make sort magical fantasy scenario one interact? Even agreed possible, what's happening right now. staying home right forcing people risk would gather deliver shit.

But whatever, want admit that....just make sure tip extra, your'e saving gas money all. Increased domestic fuel purchases. card X usually buys fuel gas station Cali 2 weeks buying guys gas station B Florida well, boom.  mean could theoretically stay bubble work home already bought groceries, drive directly event.

I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs good all, it‚Äôs better taking zero precautions. fucking idiots Well -20C/-4F doesn‚Äôt seem hard me, Pfizer(which Europe contracted) harder needs stored -80. So, would mean much mask wearing summer? know masks good, I‚Äôm sick wearing them. want minimize future events, country origin matters lot. even need explain this? Hearing witnessing two different things. were, things changed \~2 months ago.

Early (back March) outbreak mountains due virus spreading via travelers/vacationers. that, locked hard benefited proactive governor, fairly responsible populace, well spread population (bar Denver).

Then kids went back school, colleges welcomed students back, general population became fatigued COVID. Since junk show across state, disappoints proud early response. 


Of note, mask use fairly good outside rural towns college students /young adults partying. mind mask use alone can't stop this, need additional regulations. weekly grocery shopping earlier evening. Publix supermarket packed people. wife celebrating home. got us tiny little turkey breast cook shocked amount people rolling buying big 20lbs+ turkeys sorts loaded carts. 5 million people less traveling year compared last year? 

WTF wrong people? Anything shit America. One person admit free America, pissed free, started say free many people access it. SEP ends states (44) November 28. End standard UI most. Maybe keep providing care without reporting care medical supplies charged. saw something similar front page bus drivers would strike charging bus fair passengers affected yet could still send message admin ceo. flying weekly since June. airports empty sanitized.   parents work, even could rotate days off. ways accommodate supervision. I've also heard people relative friend move pandemic, especially cases someone lost thier job. 

To clear, personally supports statistically typical. people could work instacart Guess can't send help  every hospital. That's problem. Yet soon one infection lock everything again. healthcare workers include, emt/fire/medics? Costco Yeah, believe it. Westerners want believe this, though. Amy Acton saying US numbers trustworthy compared poor Asian countries ‚Äúsimping‚Äù?

When nothing base head canon, yes. Nobody asked from. words, masses public believe given time shaped government newspapers broadcasters, simply hiding facts people actually control country don‚Äôt want public know.

Lol shit.  Ruth Chris got bailout. took wife years ago. $150 appetizer, two entrees, one dessert. booze sans tip.  too!

These people working and/or handling fresh food. Looking rest population seen above. Embarrassing remember feeling foolish middle February buying extra food, toiletries, daily necessities fear possible future shortages. spouse thought over-reacting, generally lets want (happy wife, happy life that). 

I feel foolish when, St. Patrick's day, shortages shit hit fan.  suppose see family March (and fianc√© see first ever snow) one time year cancelled cautious we‚Äôre comfortable parents 63 66 fianc√© work retail/service.  went pharmacy got flu shot free today Canada. nice. deny virus hospitals get crowded.

Those firsthand accounts doctors nurses saying people dying alone gasping still claim COVID hoax real. 

I can't even people anymore. Death ultimate equalizer deny almost. That's something unheard of. celebrating Biden's victory fine. already everywhere it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs go spread anywhere previously safe.

Yes, virtually every county America active cases ‚Äî virus presence given county city, mean pandemic can't spread further. Within affected counties towns, suburbs, damn neighbourhoods even streets suffer outbreaks. human tragedies unfold. get worse. inevitable unpredictable massive LEAP deaths per day coming overwhelming number hospitals beyond crisis capacities across country, anticipate two weeks Thanksgiving following viral incubation periods. 

When room hospitals save ‚Äúsaveable‚Äù lives, whether COVID anything else, 2k deaths per day look much like ‚Äúgood ole days.‚Äù free point service anyone Another sub ask /r/personalfinance, kind issue comes lot That‚Äôs good, weatherwise it‚Äôs great outdoors time year that‚Äôs probably what‚Äôs helping might different places, usually veto override brand new vote. veto bill, legislature vote veto-proof majority *again*. possible time first second votes, legislators change minds. sure, interesting question. saw Army Nurse Corp 11,000 nurses, many specialized ICU care also good question. every nurse available used handle COVID patients. stop upvoting every word Bill Gates utters? don‚Äôt care thinks vaccine. care scientists study vaccines think. don‚Äôt upvote instead one worst capitalists country ever seen?

Good info. use. I'm not. Evil theological term meaning.  sister one idiots traveling. believes curfews restrictions government overstepping authority.

She literally posted copy constitution Facebook wall said, ""this document need go want want.""

She's flying another state ""escape lockdown.""

I'm angry. She, someone else, probably gonna get sick actions.

Meanwhile, I'm feeling guilty hit grocery store pharmacy week. Like, planned better, could probably stretch 10 days. floor made floor that's commenter said. 15.2 million people per year die heart disease stroke world every year one bats eye half year, still believe bullshit. shows America fucks bad. Americans stupid. knew? Yes, simple, understand cases requirements social distancing unreasonable, however people going refusing take basic precautions slow spread, continuing live lives nothing happening. 

I've people yell wiping commonly used surfaces, I've people tell virus government hoax. 


So yes, angry, yes, going blame people, care Human lives attached numbers even basic precautions. work many kids. Without supervision kids able virtual learning. zombies vampires dawg. also spend time complain mandating pants retarded? 

Because wear clothes sake public safety too. even vote it. show up. fuck that, going skiing! packed social distancing kind panic porn reading front page every major mainstream news publication/subreddit Doomsday Thanksgiving. Ignore live life. OP spewing misinformation. WTF. idea EMS professionals made little. nurse seriously can‚Äôt imagine stress EMS workers endure compared do, paid 4x much. EMS boots ground. mobile ER charged providing medical care, pulling mental health/social services/and often times law enforcement. ridiculous. Well fair 90+ years old, pretty much lived life already matter time anyways. Covid not. fix dying empire? Romans fix plaguing western empire? Ottomans late 19th century? Contemporary westerners brought postwar miracle anything seemed possible. bubble crashing back earth. booked Hawaii tickets, due testing requirement unreliable testing locally canceled. We'll going coast instead. arrogant ignorance makes evil. need herds thinned anyway  work directly medication charging specifically large healthcare system. 

There's much misinformation spread Reddit people think ""know"" made question anything else I've read even ounce truth it. ironic people opposed mandatory lockdowns generally people stupid shit ‚Äîlike wearing masks collected large groups indoors ‚Äî make lockdowns necessary. I‚Äôve hearing it‚Äôs like 9/11 everyday people still shrug shoulders. literally chance ‚Äúsorry‚Äù don‚Äôt interact single person...

That‚Äôs like throwing water wet dirt case it‚Äôs fire. ‚ÄúBetter safe sorry‚Äù. Yeah, no. That‚Äôs illogical. GOP-cult equivalent ""drinking Kool-Aid""? Don‚Äôt go prison. Millions able it.
Prioritization front line healthcare/public service workers, elderly high risk, essential employees non-healthcare/public service fields, everyone else. People make bad life choices still fall ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù category. That's said though. specifically talking quarantining months. Sorry, asshole here. Masks never totally disappear longer viewed ""taboo"" West. ever get sick, cold, etc, know I'll wear mask public places matter go. That's good thing think. philanthropy built decades pretty immoral business man. Stuff makes Bezos, Musk, Etc. look like saints. He‚Äôs trying buy good legacy it‚Äôs easy billions. I‚Äôm impressed people generous it‚Äôs easy. Still wait weeks see full impact hospitals cases new now.

But doubled month, given nothing done federal level (besides federal officials calling people oppose states trying do), holidays coming up, surprised see another two doublings. we've mask mandate months I've time refine technique. 

At first tried polite: ""Excuse me, sir..."" snap works better. insulting way get someone's attention, I'm tired shit. Snap, death stare, ""That needs mouth nose.""

Worse, summer months infections low, governments failed develop effective mass testing contact tracing systems would prevented resurgence cases.

Im sure agree this. Testing massively ramped summer watched results hundreds thousands tests per day likes France.

They didnt anything results rearrange deck chairs.

The reality concerned image efficacy. Europe goverments PR battle citizens summer early Autumn. Thats fight interested great job it. Ive idea thats cared about. assume know.  Glad see im one. think wife finally talked everyone it. Probably helped cousin 2 covid. Even still going include cousins Yes, forcing Tesla open helping pandemic spread. couldn‚Äôt find original fairly nice never claimed Great Reset group people purposely creating coronavirus pandemic usher desired change. claimed Great Reset real thing, is, even says article. That's referring to, I'm talking World Economic Forum saying, people think saying.  virus gone China. think 8 total cases last week. Also vaccine while. stupid comparison smooth brain Trump this, intentionally. I'm glad favorite holiday. many instances cops pulling someone mask driver asking put one keep distanced possible still won‚Äôt. People know, posts local Facebook pages, etc. 
people want know call report police? America themselves. China handed us bullets told us bullets knowingly deliberately loaded Twitter account blasted face pretending big deal. Well, it‚Äôs big deal. totally deserve this.

Not me, considering I‚Äôm one all, I‚Äôll take blame sinking plague ship country. Sure. Maybe I‚Äôll die too. I‚Äôll telling every American go fuck themselves.

I already feel ""WELL ACHTUALLY"" coming. UN member china let in. cou tries decide gets membership buddies china. 

Taiwan help china this. refused information china. never privy information. China banking severe outbreak bring decimated.  Taiwan knew better locked country. Also, par?  roughly 500 cases total entire year, last checked. No, workers literally choice. quit, unemployment. particular county. seeing uniform trends domestic violence across US covid. counties seeing far fewer calls (not necessarily good sign) we‚Äôre seeing vastly different things depending community resources access. confused going moment, someone may enlighten I‚Äôm struggling understand they‚Äôre still allowing people travel?

Because second government takes away right guarantee ever come back. people want Big Brother protect slightly dangerous virus lost. never actual way controlling pandemic. virus already around globe anybody knew anything wrong gestation period mildly asymptomatic carriers. 
Every country business China thousands people flying back every week two checking business operations meeting suppliers, time thing showed problem China already percolating everywhere else. Oh god remembered 

Black Friday Nah man I‚Äôve responsible whole pandemic. I‚Äôm missing major holiday folks people suck. constructive intelligent response. Care provide facts? freedom. Maybe USA administration could fake massive terrorist attack scare people houses, war freedom eats reason breakfast. them, obviously, drug produced tiny numbers comparison scale problem, requires hospital medical visit administered iv, antiviral ace2 receptor inhibitor needs given early avoid severe critical stage immune system dysregulation covid causes would help, thus essentially going helpful pandemic situation. might downvoted, people understand nothing believe covid thing overblown easily solvable. tokyo talking shut less 1000 people per day. Y'all US fucked. Can't go home visit ill father cuz y'all fucking idiots. dont want this, point masks delay individuals getting best. 

Vaccines viable strains since know covid hit cats dogs minks proof species hops. Since mink variant back people know mutate come back 

What dont know species it

What know impossible quarantine nature ( think rats ) 

The economy already changed forever, remote work likely stay regardless everyones vaccine optimism dont see vaccines keeping ... much like dont keep flu 

At point society changed doesnt know yet People stupid Family always come first some. Perhaps it‚Äôs mindset catch it, they‚Äôll least within vicinity loved ones rather hospital bed across country alone doctor holding phone head take last breath. would think description current hospital scenarios would enough families call gatherings. 

I‚Äôm sure test social distancing masks, obviously mitigation enforced it‚Äôs free all. people bringing politics table wearing mask socially distancing not. US already spends money per capita healthcare countries worldwide. legalized corruption makes actually *getting* healthcare expensive people. less important wear pants mask point time. Try going anywhere pants underwear see effective society enforcing rules.  Sure, person could go infect younger residents, mention healthcare workers *their* families. none lives matter either?

Also, we've already seen superspreader events often people completely unrelated event ones end dying. ""AmErIcAnS DuMb"" stfu. tired hearing shit. Americans reason type stupid statement internet. America reason progressed information age. stfu. Step 2, scale. See: AUS. 

Cluged together nothing step: wear mask want, move freely town, next, club closed go next county over, go school, watch football game, work starve. See: US colleagues take COVID seriously. started working home since April. like think vaccine magic wand make everything go away. don‚Äôt know even vaccine, it‚Äôll years experience normal. may even remember it‚Äôs like time comes. necessarily travel, that's much situational. most, large gathering extended family.

Edit- saying understand need travel and/or huge traditional blow-out. Two things related Thanksgiving.  Get meat thermometer one already! like cheating pleases everyone. It‚Äôs worldwide issue boyfriend infuriated I'm interested going family's numerous, massive Thanksgiving events. He's bitching that, ""I never visit I'm shut in."" he's freaking may gotten exposed work. Like, one it, dude? mad I'm isolating mad might've exposed thus family? Wow. It‚Äôs great they‚Äôre taking seriously. Okay nothing. Username checks Right? wish mother law could say grown children. can't apparently. working home super careful (I high risk child) occasionally see seeing holidays two weeks after. told see relief coming virus spiking everywhere right now, please cancel. won't. lonely making good decisions. Breaks heart (she's 78 honestly one best friends). Might significant impact cases, they're delivering high risk, could amazing impact deaths within weeks. According article, mistrust government one primary reasons French opposed vaccines. We're 9 days away 12th level Jumanji, can't many people mindset anymore. point gotta dont care dont know. special type oblivious. Wife works airport. Nothing changed. one cares enforces shit. Unbelievable!

I little embarrassed behavior United States. 

Are dumb? guys US decide fire Fauci we'll welcome here. Bars restaurants downtown 2 3 large cities Canada well 100 years old COVID breeding grounds.  Well, americans intelligence dont match. üòÉ Many America secretive all. Don‚Äôt forget quickly compassionately responded trillions aid help poor billionaires mega corporations. Lol... people sad. pick outlier cases everything act like norm. Fucken yanks..... China locked 21 days Feb-March, going control thousands cases popping every province. right. pretty simple really, virus incubate 14 days, lock down, mass testing, identify+quarantine sick, done, left society virus. lockdown better strict enforced. 

Those want make sacrifice 21 day strict lockdown, doomed suffer multi-year pandemic + high amount deaths Welp virus gonna virus especially it‚Äôs widely propagated US, unfortunately lots people gonna traditional people time year without restrictions and... results gonna ensue. is, except didn‚Äôt be. true even vaccines distributed smoothly holidays.  Even see people get-togethers Florida. No, hasn't. Refusing bullshit deal billion actually help anyone blocking trillions dollars stimulus aid.

This McConnell GOP stopping help. According CDC source origin virus yet identified. outbreak started Ahhh yes thing happen much quicker due mass transit, sure better meds also multiple population's past. know much Virus due less information. ton information magnitudes BS stupid people. 

This might claim lives time around ""globally"" spanish flu end faster well...

overally would looking kill rate. also make good instacart runners Dude course not, dont even pay attention that. Tests, especially rapid ones lots false negatives though.

Not seeing anyone two weeks would best that‚Äôs hard, logistically mental health. Texas school systems fucking joke, parents pull kids teachers quit. Let fold like house cards is. think we'll find lot countries data pretty inaccurate tbh. tool lol.

""If want help dad depressed lives alone, voted Trump"". Hahaha. hyperbolic idiocy sad. 

I anti bodies ‚Äúinfected again‚Äù. I‚Äôm safe. stupid afraid always bad combination. 

Have fun lame insults boring bland life devoid love light. grocery store (Publix) even gives $10 gift card get flu shot pharmacy, also takes insurance. You‚Äôre right. Trump never let good crisis go waste. ‚ÄúThe virus we‚Äôre talking do, lot people think goes away April, heat, heat comes in, typically go away go back pasture, sheep.  find least shocking all. 

Of course fucked shit, shocking. literally happening. work airline United States, one smaller ones, verify travel surging employer. fact, bookings declined past weeks. fuck?

We people refuse wear masks feel like government oppression. people already claiming get vaccine released. President USA example said COVID-19 go away, hasn‚Äôt COVID-19 related meetings 4 months, today went golfing instead attending G-20 summit pandemic preparedness. McConnell approved relief bills desk months refuses bring vote help millions Americans brink eviction homelessness simply ensure deficit lands Democrats Biden‚Äôs presidency instead Republicans Trump‚Äôs. people gathering large crowds protest disinformation campaign election fraud, many wearing masks. people hosting large weddings, parties, planning travel Thanksgiving, probably Christmas too. Earlier year even states refusing lock schools, requiring law children sent school close proximity peers teachers everyone ounce rational thought told bad idea children would die; guess what? Children died.

Your argument current stage pandemic exclusively result lack preparedness hilariously wrong. Sheer stupidity fact major contributing factor. lack preparedness semi-valid excuse pandemic started. Everything since result blatant stupidity.

No formatting purpose want main paragraph run properly highlight insanity situation we‚Äôre in. Unfortunately typed isn‚Äôt even half it. That's even better idea crazy people say ""China LIED"" demand travel banned, seemingly issue this. maybe family then, big travel holiday always Christmas don‚Äôt understand many people stupid Yeah plan would work well me. go anywhere, could easily home week, get tested, go anywhere 3 days, join them. problem. 

I wish people would contact legislators rapid home tests. rapidtests.org Exactly signalling silly. one thing reject social contact 2 weeks. 2 months stretch. 2 years something none us signed either feasible cause host mental health issues. Heck next door neighbor constantly friends nothing happening. blaming China nothing else. Could perhaps powered induced current outside body? Australia 
New Zealand

China
Japan That‚Äôs idiotic flys face science.

You idiotic fly face science. Eat shit die plague bearer. one biggest issues hear Republicans hate Democrats. You‚Äôre right. They‚Äôd win lot voters would give up. wife ordered katz deli mail order Thanksgiving instead cooking year.

I think good way distract us fact year different. Ill miss mom goddamn turkey rueben help. us, im considering going home christmas. went home id around one person recovering recently finishing (month ago) chemotherapy, one person general bad health. Well, cause unlike flyers. worry lumped together 12 million actually 3% 340 million... it‚Äôs far need fucking jobs close country fuck down. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs game we‚Äôre pons...  ensures need keep longer, unfortunately. pretty much figured gonna go way that‚Äôs leave work store... people work laughed saving masks winter üôÑ blame either.. packages delivery car trunk extremely careful groceries clothing. also cut back number pickups next couple months. covid (yay grocery store), recovered, still going holidays. son ordering food Thanksgiving (he's virtual classes school, too).

Oh, broke leg can't go anywhere.


Wait.


Can everyone break leg force stay home 2 months? 

New law: caught bring dumbass traveling, break leg. 'Merica. Honestly know believe put platform gets deleted everything don‚Äôt like does... check agenda 2030 study used data till August, first wave ending cities starting rural areas. Extend data till November, trend reversed. literally artefact pandemic hit first absolutely nothing masks. Yes cant blame USA failed adress corona virus, still need blame China existance. good old common sense sure working around US right isn‚Äôt it. problems whatsoever. put ahead others extent don‚Äôt mind killing people avoid tiny inconvenience. seems pretty evil. Actively enough viral load body spread virus, whether they‚Äôre symptomatic. social distancing extremely difficult. goes human nature makes people feel isolated alone. leads weakened mental health state. hate casually throw hand washing masks actually really easy do. different things. Confirms survival rate 98%, that's something. assume Rupert Murdoch run headline saying Italy owes Britain ¬£351 Billion Covid, good point. think may randomness initial spread. 

This plague driven super spreading events. 

The Wuhan version infectious dense, polluted cold Wuhan/ Chinese New Year celebrations/ military games, kind accelerated spread. 

Compared Wuhan, really pick Italy Milan Fashion Week Ski Week.

This like compared Seoul, Daegu much smaller city less visitors Wuhan. Seoul totally outbreak Daegu. depend population flow whether superspreader actions took/not took prevent spread. 

Does make sense? Thanks correction. voted Biden wife came back Los Angeles year duck pandemic ‚Äî bad move. It‚Äôs way worse there. They‚Äôre shutting back 7.2% positivity rate; meanwhile we‚Äôre nearing 15% Polis isn‚Äôt even considering shutting back taking stricter measures. Meanwhile, building live told everyone it‚Äôs mandatory wear mask you‚Äôre apartment literally single person besides wife it. 

I don‚Äôt understand one wants take seriously. Bored pointless work zoom call. No, society used keep dumber people dead-end working class lives institutions bother anyone.

Now stupid asses Facebook Tiktok pushing crackpot theories, large political machine successfully managed co-opt votes agendas.  state got national guard.

I'd like point 5 million chinese people traveling world that's Social Distancing wearing masks many things changed since then. mention know many people travel country celebrate Thanksgiving. exactly apples apples comparison. remember back AIDS first appeared hysteria came with. yall waiting ""cure"" covid seeing older family, they're probably going die happens. things way opportunity pay respects cant gatherings like funerals. Like posts covid bunch people blaming people. Blah Blah Blah least month ago. think due uncertainty safety vaccine. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll change tune. That's kind you. I've never tipped bringing someone's order out. Altho, tbh... saw money trunk realize me. way get infected stay home Thanksgiving, go local grocery store buy groceries cook Thanksgiving. stupid post  France noooooo something I've noticed countries' data seems odd, know explanation is. countries much lower death count per case U.S. course would make sense lot testing U.S. testing asymptomatic people. U.S. higher testing rate countries. No! *shrugs*

This America. Wow. county 320k people gets cases per day. Yep we‚Äôre nation idiots  want remember this. r yeah right can‚Äôt wait day we‚Äôre like ‚Äúhey, remember COVID?‚Äù. aunt wanted huge family reunion. I'm immunocompromised due disability told everyone safe isolating tested negative. going beach resort popular restaurant open public building rooms would stay in. told would portable air purifier, got one flask face dividers doctor friend, mask UV light pen clean things whatever, that's safe go. mention aunt stage 4 melinoma currently chemotherapy!! also obese breathing issues. Well, everyone cancelled bit shit, covid looks like bad idea even insane family memebrs. aunt somehow caught covid. guess safe claimed idea survive this. I'm little insulted tried get shit knew I'm immunocompromised birth heart condition. People fucking crazy, man. Nothing stop them, even literally going chemotherapy. Source? give reason making mandatory? Seems like would make certain everyone immune enough. No. all. Unless person something agreement landlord. Then, yes legal. Family friends struggling financially (we caught good deals) cooking everyone day early delivering it. Everyone reheat kill potential germs next day Thanksgiving via Skype. hear lot ‚Äújust wait see‚Äù wait see what?!? deep state plot get us skip thanksgiving!?! weirdos. Actually leave $10 tip car trunk. lucky walmart delivers car small town.  ""So definitely deadly pandemic likely lead economic shutdowns quarantines across globe constantly send mixed messages obvious protective measures, also say China mean.""

Yeah, really buy without guy Trump would coherent domestic policy. Remind me! 3 weeks Yes! trying buy N95s since May -- many counterfeit, careful!!! pages &amp; pages KN95s &amp; N95s masks counterfeit lists, showing tell counterfeit, get end massive list &amp; descriptions images even ones stamped OSHA good. gave up. Double masking it! Considering survey polled 18,526 online adults aged 16-74 across 15 countries, would take numbers grain salt. That‚Äôs 1,235 people per country. Prescription. Thanks concern. new case study New Zealand‚Äôs Ministry Health finds Covid-19 spread long-haul flights.  September, two international studies came conclusion. last month, Irish study linked 59 Covid-19 cases one seven-hour flight.  New Zealand researchers looked outbreak among passengers traveled 18-hour Emirates flight Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Auckland, New Zealand late September. Seven 86 passengers onboard later tested positive managed 14-day quarantine. No, it‚Äôs history repeated, pandemic never considered originated outbreak Spain, it‚Äôs pretty clear epidemic commenced Wuhan, articles trying negate clearly load bullshit. Well, blame covid cases deaths republicans, that's politicize it.

Not saying Republicans blame more, people side tends take virus less seriously.

The fact is, independent party affiliates, lots people part. Looks like red team leading. much winning. Dear leader must proud. Lol deaths single digits since July. Fkn Americans... In-laws father Vietnam kinda stuck initially flight back flight would cost 12,000 dollars decided stay.

When posted curfew neighbours would beat anyone breaking curfew bamboo sticks. said learned every 2-3 years infectious disease outbreaks region populace practiced response understanding.

Different west.  attention span. care job, weight, people. give out. show up, try best keep attentiveness. likely already knew matter showed say did.

This manslaughter attention. premeditated. Trump symptom. disease: denying reality favor narcissistic fantasies. elections likely free

Cringe  response, Americans criticized high casualty rate Vietnamese civilians, was: ""It deprive enemy population, one point 1968, Westmoreland considered use nuclear weapons Vietnam contingency plan codenamed Fracture Jaw, abandoned became known White Mm, arrogance undoing.

We thought least good years scare pandemic. serious health issues. Mind sharp ever. still energetic enough babysit nieces. gone. get it, introvert leave children without parents 8 hours day? parents go work time? Congratulations, call whatever want, engaged child care. Education definitely goal purpose, fact also child care inescapable unless want ignore reality. Sorry, sympathy people learn shit go coasts spring. gotta get reports constantly. We've known months right? deaths shown total deaths state. represent deaths attributed COVID-19. baseline 28 people per 100k dying week add additional 28 people dying COVID, guess looked total deaths week, would likely around 56. PREACH /r/RedditMoment &amp;#x200B;

I shocked (not really) much food produce ends landfill. Seems like problem logistic. Innovation much needed solve this. wish could move collectively away companies like facebook etc value/uplift ideas actually innovative help us come adaptable solutions. Seems like politicians thinking ""so many old people SSI/SSA, frees budget tax cuts!"" I‚Äôve honestly decided Deep South full inbred uneducated trumpites educated. Ive declared husband I‚Äôm never ever going Deep South buying anything know thats made there. can‚Äôt fund stupid. that's quite assumption lmao shocked 
/s many days year think people take every day off? know people drop everything life travel home move supervise kids? extra bedrooms bathrooms work? think logic this. statistical anomaly people could turn dime this. son born April 3rd first wave. basically stuck hospital suite 3 days. Fun times. Pack extra clothes, tooth brush, deodorant, snacks, phone charger etc. father, extra person allowed. also allowed leave maternity wing come back. nervous covid ended fine. covid wing far away baby wing. okay. Congrats! report also omitted Chinese government notified US CDC January 3 discovery potentially new coronavirus‚Äîthe day ‚Äúgag order‚Äù issued‚Äîeven noted received information China mysterious pneumonia outbreak December 31. willing risk life wrong. evil, ever saw it.  I'm triggered inability write coherent sentence. suspect new know full extent side effects wife decided pull kid school coming week. going see numbers explode 3 weeks, I'm getting really scared healthcare workers risk. Never underestimate power stupid people large groups. knew coming. Naw, Missouri pull bootstraps. 

Seriously, well received military assistance people think virus deep state conspiracy anyways? Hope wearing armor PPE, private. really scary ones is, % positive cases that's mostly red. Funny happens authorities take seriously almost everyone complies without screaming ""muh freedumbs"". managed without closing borders mandatory quarantine arrivals though. good deal Americans trying toe line. real tragedy topmost government officials flaunt unwillingness wear masks social distance. 73 MILLION idiots voted incompetent fraud president sycophants. wonder 1/2 Americans don‚Äôt believe COVID real?? Yes, (NZ) tightened trial error. tested day 3 day 12 isolation. People test positive day 12 despite symptoms/already test flight. no, final stretch, all. nothing close that. get idea head. nowhere near end this. support COVID-related stimulus packages? 

Considering Senate went recess (again!) without passing stimulus, I'm gonna say no. people donate poor

I donate 10% income school's food pantry week. much something. gig work donate plasma. donate seen bad unemployment city. went without food anyone else ever experience that. guess reason donate COVID. COVID reason things bad here. say all, said travelling outside community extremely selfish. go putting words mouth. Imbecile. I'm dissapointed chose report twice rather debate shutdown joke. Almost every single person suddenly became ""essential worker"". Thats America‚Äôs credit, America‚Äôs shame. going way that. city got 16 new cases none past months. They‚Äôre handing $300 fines anyone wearing mask public spaces, outdoors virus already politicized. fact, that's really point chart discussion. pretend neutral, mostly want save lives. Aww, cute FDELAYERS prevent public medical innovations need usual Yep figured much... hence I‚Äôm staying home I‚Äôm work. Whenever bring number deaths certain family members, say ‚Äúthe numbers inflated.‚Äù would feel heard someone took advice died? wondering. wear mask inside home... know that? üòè people stupid? lot people really can't come terms fact vaccinating whole population huge struggle whole lot reasons. going fast easy simple point. america essentially incapable large scale things like anymore political gridlock. Early pandemic Republicans voted essentially tie hands issuing mandate would essential require masks. local city council area constantly war Republicans question masks non-stop them, even NOW. uphill battle every step way areas suffering without doubt mostly red. Unfortunately areas butted there's dodging even live liberal leaning areas. 

Anyway, long story short, I'm incredibly grateful lady caught TON flack sticking guns thing, even though mandate voluntary. tip iceberg, forget thanks giving Christmas New Years. Even people travel that. I‚Äôm little confused 


*To give context rolling averages, consider typical year, two-week period, expect 28 100,000 people die. looking deaths 14 days per 100k, value 28 would represent doubling baseline mortality rate.*

How could figure represent average double baseline? understand paying taxes also noble way help less fortunate.

Love this. Well said. I'm Canadian, system perfect, believe way thinking critical healthy, sustainable society. elderly, health care workers, essential business employees...

Though, I'm betting uproar tone deaf celebrity/athlete (maybe many) posts early vaccine social media. watch. think children go school 8 hours day? children without parents, child care facility. also education facility, de fucking facto anywhere leave kids without present engaged child care.

Yes, get triggered stupid people. think positive quality. know stats. Hence stats gave bullshit. 100% survival rate 20 would mean nobody died. admitting crap. hard shutdown enough stimulus everyone, rather expect buisnesses remain open people arn't going shop. people can't afford work shop risk dying, buisnesses can't remain open. time, pandemic really dangerous people, 70-90 years old, make sens. first time, I‚Äôm glad Australia Asian American days. lot people I've talked waiting months take take vaccine available. 

I'm sure eventually become mandatory right away much death sickness 
 Americans see making mask wearing required. easy do. easy slow/stop spread. I‚Äôve sick long-haul COVID, know people average length COVID, friend died. Many lost much more. testing capacity probably near limit. number ceiling result. Four five months ago, said would hit 250k. mocked, mocking comments since deleted themselves.

With current trajectory on, 350k deaths certain. 450 likely. 600k possible.

American individualism metastasized apathy indifference. inability care people know, unwillingness bear slightest discomforts, incessant selfishness continue make painful ever needed be.

Individually, none us deserved this. Societally, exactly get. mention US obese nation, comorbidity covid.

Well, could well lasted opposite reasons. covid happened 1920s, 2 cents passing faster spanish flu. present day scenario different. media social media, fear general public, forcing shut down, government subsequently shutting down, obviously good thing. Also people confidence developing vaccines lot faster, benefit hindsight, locking march bad move Might support unit regular army mobile conex coolers really designed morgue use though. Oh ya I'm genuinely worried mental health friends living solo single apartments. That's good u least offer that. Street food hard profitable suburban rural areas. billions dollars thrown allow proceed speed light. takes meny research, lots money.

Now that's efficiency! bad news... Several pictures chart purely politicising virus shows maker's political affirmation dems conservative, sure, consistent trend East Asia.

I longer believe this. I‚Äôve already responded saying essentially thing another thread. School ~5.5 hours. don‚Äôt send kids school warehouse 5.5 hours/day. live can‚Äôt go grocery store wife?!?

From (layman‚Äôs) understanding, grocery store shopping isn‚Äôt super high risk, owing size stores large, length time people spend near strangers small (this assumes universal masking place).

As people streets signs, also isn‚Äôt super high risk, owing fact it‚Äôs outdoors indoors. masked. 

The trick-or-treating bans places made sense me. isn‚Äôt stomach bug. live relatively strict allow trick-or-treating; encouraged people wear masks, pretty much everyone did. (That‚Äôs say area didn‚Äôt spike post-Halloween ‚Äî ‚Äî contact tracing revealed several large, indoor gatherings teens 20-somethings transmission occurred. trick-or-treating.) Instead trying chop India bottom Asia, could admit made mistake? Seems like that'd lot easier. Glad see progress America!

Meanwhile government city encouraging people get infected instead I'd laugh sad.  many dashes!! would need implant chip already walk around gps tracker everywhere go? You‚Äôre 100% correct. dumb ass Redditor knows anything vaccines they‚Äôve read articles last 8 months. blows mind tbh. I‚Äôve Vit script since 2018 still. lack empathy others hardship problem. attributing redditors doctor said? got abortion back stigma would far greater today. couldn‚Äôt even get divorce, interracial marriage, say anything blaspheming christianity. serious? Fundie abortion screechers new, notice opposition now. think cash play here. question individualism. 

""Live free die"" common motto US, all. downside getting vaccine, don‚Äôt understand wouldn‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôve taken enough vaccines time they‚Äôve fine air lift, planes helicopters probably would bring table, staff set vaccination stations remote areas, plus staffing man power. people would also handle storage likely logistics setting centers needed areas. That‚Äôs lot source: (for don‚Äôt want go dig)

Newly Infected (as Nov 6): 549,000 / day (170 / 100k)

Wish common knowledge 8 months ago. Oh wait mom teach speak like that? Born brothel you? (You may need look word lol ) statement hilarious. *let wait months guinea pigs ensure it‚Äôs safe*

What fuck going wait for? find couple articles people dying, unrelated vaccine, justify unsafe like ‚Äòtold so‚Äô planes carrying capacity right outbreak. 

Cut numbers quarter that, give people distance other. Still, least 4 close enough infected, were. Nothing stand way American wants big meal. That‚Äôs buy one Yeah would imagine military wanting help private sector get vaccine distributed fast possible. India barely part Asia subcontinent. Internet person - school ~5.5 hours. know works less 5.5 hours day? People need time get work drop pick kids..

Do people PAY lot money kids stay school, yes. People also pay money nannies/babysitters/other organized programs pick kids school watch school.  Often school programs campus, nearby YMCAs Boys Girls clubs instead.

Obviously don‚Äôt kids go school else would know this! making bunch assumptions true. Risk dying onboard Delta 737NG flight Chicago St Louis: 1 8487941 (source: ‚Äúamigoingdown‚Äù app)

Wow. hope won‚Äôt take long. upcoming vaccines need given 2 doses well? SIX FEEEEEEET RULE! Unless there's crazy autoimmune mediated reaction occurs year vaccine, we're going see anything like that, given severity pandemic, risk going unvaccinated almost certainly higher. vaccine adverse reactions occur quickly administration.

Also, enough vaccines ENTIRE population (for every Joe Sally want one) living restriction-less summer two different sentiments, right?

But comes China, sorts articles posted didn‚Äôt fuck beginning everyone around world accept whatever say regarding timeline critical information released COVID...

I don‚Äôt believe CCP article complete bullshit. Vietnam runs authoritarian covid prevention successful government absolute physical control people. I‚Äôd gladly take chances covid rampant US populace live shit. This. I'm set up, money saved need work foreseeable future...

Im lucky. absolutely staying inside telling everyone fuck off. need help. people suffering I. helping them? poorer people, say. again, many living warzone, help less fortunate? living warzones may active fear death. living fear may actively dying, let's concern them. actively dying may living excruciating pain. determine pain moment, since concerned suffering most? rest afterthought. 

Victoria's lockdown sucked. proud fellow Victorians pulling through. Non-Victorian Australians go lockdown. problems, go lockdown. talk lockdown coronavirus-related, that's diminish suffering others. People go worse fates lockdown. nearly certain suffering worse people. Everyone suffers. competition. Personally, got lockdown better most. also know entirely Victorian endeavour. 

South Australians went 3-day lockdown. probably tough too. I'm going tell lockdown nothing. audacity act lockdowns way similar, calmly firmly tell they're wrong. That's say problems. say problems diminished. likely moderna vaccine. I‚Äôm phase 3 trial. felt pretty blah day, front hasn‚Äôt fallen yet. Given control virus get I‚Äôm actually worried guys me. How, know understand things right now, wearing mask law wearing seat belt? seat belt protects yourself. mask both. cannot suggestion anymore. question would give person place business fine? ""No mask, service"" policy every business indoors. state mask mandate quite awhile we‚Äôve dodged big surges recently; town 18,000 134 infections instance. Today announcement 17 new cases within local county sheriff‚Äôs department. None cops wear masks, supporters wear Thin Blue Line ones. weird. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd jump opportunity wear vehicles. people always use Worldometer instead 1point3acres? 1point3acres better layout go multiple pages see info need make them. Remember used worried mass shooters? One person coughing taking mask breath bad. Trump-entrenched South Carolina. live California, us know better. I‚Äôm covid denialist. take seriously remind family also. time don‚Äôt buy idea never overcome like many do. Thanks super valuable insightful contribution!

Let guess - fundie? death rate isn‚Äôt high enough justify us afraid, that‚Äôs why. $2! Woo-hoo. Yeah agree you, numbers counted. however understand universities stance want report number population student technically resident town, totally see decision made way, want double count. really agree decision though. People live know numbers infected thier community fuck Eh, I'll plan later panic later later. Yeah, shit. people disturbed way. Let educate you, friend. Wuhan government tried silence doctor downplay virus. CCP found fired local leaders swooped army control situation.

If upset doctor happy CCPs response. Americans, still ungodly reason considering family gathering thanksgiving/Christmas, please don't. already got highest civilian award US offer George W Bush 2008. Presidential Medal Freedom work HIV AIDS.

Smh Lolol...shits gonna better year dummies start wearing masks can't care anymore. people counties people support idiotic decisions, they're ones going get sick stupidity. care get sick die. Natural selection work. 

It's unfortunate they're dead set setting houses fire windstorm. Yep.  48 mention Chippendale‚Äôs?  friend worked Regeneron put touch trial coordinator San Francisco - requirement either positive COVID housemate is, though.  Shit kind shocking see hatred towards people living humans entirety historical records.  I'm going get votes, leave FDA. Nurses opinion it. job stick needles. Doctors prescribe patients drugs even horrible side effects. politics. support vaccine btw. Articles like help. issue though selfishness hurts lot selflessness helps. Going extra mile really help, cutting corners things like masks bars hurts *ton.*  I've telling friends ""I think answer question people intrinsically good"".  That's justified know people flying stupid reasons. risk vaccine complications lower higher risk complications disease itself? still know. seems safe new type vaccine never tried before. studied biochemistry, actually understand mechanism they're talking about, still would nervous one first try it. Could unexpected side effects couple years? one knows anything point, makes sense cautious. There's also fact Asian countries used wearing masks, thanks SARS. US huge innate resistance among people political stripes. forgotten beginning response someone wearing mask public scorn taking PPE healthcare worker. banned local coronavirus sub saying masks work grounds spreading disinformation. Well good thing might last time they'll see members family kill actions. right wrong. said July June. think need create special prize people keep trying face stupidity even death threats. place, would totally given people started suggesting beheading me. problem 'living free' kill me. **expects 70 million 150 million people U.S. become infected COVID-19**

i mean true infection rate still likely end around mark? 

just back envelope math indicates 261k deaths 0.5% true fatality rate would mean around 50m infections US far. maybe that's bit high side ain't yet country 80 million people, bordered sides countries far higher death tolls manages 13,000 deaths. That's absolutely remarkable. extremely naive think could put Australia New Zealand Germany's geographical position enjoy success. South Korea even ""extreme"" comparison. Thailand 30% GDP per capita South Korea 10% covid deaths, larger population.

Another thing worth pointing apparently weak scientific literacy/education general population Thailand compared West. little seemed helped West... It‚Äôs people dealing bs people like situation bad is. want win. want complain sometimes without told suck up. :( Surely wanted rant medical condition. tinnitus Tourette's. suck, maybe bad deal with, friends family willing hear grateful for. Even then, I'm complaining lockdown since over, I'm grateful for. I'm grateful health family I. I'm extremely grateful live Australia. I'm grateful Victorians able get wave like almost nowhere else world. I'm grateful Adelaide able achieve 0 without pain went through. want rant problems, I'm ears.  post scientific papers, source said?

Would interested read it. Free city Austin public health. insurance needed. American yes, entire system revealed complete joke got mask mandate went effect. 

Then month ago, made friend. Two days later tested positive covid...then I. Low energy account saying there's chance kind depends view it. 

The time takes random person walk pharmacy get vaccinated? That's probably going somewhere second quarter 2021, year. 

Having doses doctors however case earlier enough vaccinate everyone. realize healthy young adults gotten serious cases/deaths right? Street drugs person survive, tell wife hello. Think this, 2000 Americans going dying Christmas.

There article day, something like, ""After big-family Thanksgiving dinner, plan small-family Christmas funeral."" different seasonal wind. idea come conclusion give shit people based comment. factual, average American shown give shit protecting people, inevitable massacre result. No, actually not. Scientific papers also raised point actual cutoff point (cycle threshold).

It's valid discussion. assuming every laboratory right moment -- might might true.

The thing would rule malice - would rather think laboratories over-cautious worried smaller amounts viral material (and consequence) others. Good 

You're saving lives problem decent amount either 1) think virus overblown 2) firmly believe masks absolutely nothing they're tricked reason. good amount people honestly stupid evil. live Queensland much changed took seriously start closed borders put restrictions life tbh many people know really change all. Greece, Germany, Iceland, Czech Republic, Greenland, Cyprus, Finland, Latvia. 

Australia NZ huge islands middle nowhere people land borders. can't even begin compare thekr challenges central European country Neither countries population anywhere near US. Also, I‚Äôm tired NZ example bc it‚Äôs tiny, isolated island population size ONE US city...of course it‚Äôs much easier control virus thank god beef safe.... simple. us Victorians second wave. rest pretty much covid free since June, barring odd small cluster Sydney one Adelaide.

So corona beat back hard create headlines. 

All states well first wave though... Got virtually zero everywhere. Victoria's second wave caused leaked quarantine issues. clusterfuck 
of epic proportions. response afterwards glorious. much horsepower local Bistro have? Sounds like herd mentality actual leadership coming federal government right now... get American food lines.

People always line huge cars. you, know, sell car pay off?

In South Africa people need food, houses, nevermind cars. weird see difference. works Melbourne Sydney lately? Large swathes basically like big Asian cities. Also behaviour population far subservient like Asians Americans. school system spent 30 years teaching reinforcing idea everyone special entitled. traded critical thinking letting people ""feels"" right. thing surprises people surprised Americans acting ""special"" entitled.

We're reaping we've sown. Really nothing article mentioned.

Just common sense, ""west"" seems lacking. Break like Wind you‚Äôre country rioting going shit. rich old white dude putting peoples lives risk?!

The guys still job do, still go work despite horrible pay everything comes emergency responder.

I decided wasn‚Äôt left objectively ‚Äúeasier‚Äù career path, least myself. I‚Äôm glad it, knowledge gained still comes handy today, know handle situations typically freeze others.

An elderly woman episode thought looked like seizure work months ago. approached situation calmly able give small comfort care direct people around help real professionals - guys like father - show heroes are. mandatory approved emergency use.  full approval, problems making mandatory. $600 month isn‚Äôt enough people stay home.

I've 3. Australia FAR culturally American 'Asian'. earth get that? still know probability theory practice ""a miracle"" (with explanation), fresh news:

* Everyone 'healed' covid care home
* 10 11 elderly tested positive covid, aged 80 98, past virus healthy again
* Many (all) dementia, means kept calm, stress, probably even realize pandemic going world
* doctor's assistance supervision

Google translated article, source major national online portal (of course that's 100% it‚Äôs cold.... obviously eat without getting virus since eat hot! Im sure dont. expect regions lower capacity? cause China evil. China score 100, countries need take exam all. Looks like we'll hit 200k new infections *tomorrow* probably Ok maybe 30k feet like country would contain it, China tried suppress communications China locked international borders.

China must pay global reparations now.  also going Germany. makes sense biontech vaccine initially developed there. idea good things happen good people, bad things happen bad people. Chinese people owe wealth CCP. authoritarian government power, means carry burden failures reap glory successes. right China can't stop winning.

The Chinese extremely proud leaders, say yours? much patient, going lose one. accept many patients going far worse lockdown, well lockdown.

How think ""win"" one baffles me. took way much comment. statement full blown, major lockdowns extended periods time ""just discipline"". much that. say lock downs wrong, implying easy accomplish dishonest. False negatives slightest bit unlikely. completely expected someone tested day gets infected.[We‚Äôve known since 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreased 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 100%-100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27%-94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18%-65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12%-30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13%-31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54%-77%) day 21. false-negative rate minimized 8 days exposure‚Äîthat is, 3 days onset symptoms average.

Conclusions:

The false-negative rate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing highly variable: highest within first 5 days exposure (up 67%), lowest day 8 exposure (21%).  stadiums used winter? Kill Santa Satan. Apocalypse. Butt mate. Asians UK USA getting infected rate everyone else. people promoting idea genetic differences racists. Please don‚Äôt listen That‚Äôs awesome. expedite recovery! Yeah, I'm holding anything Biden's comfortably Oval Office President. military many super cold storage trucks they. Okay... mean anything. astrophysicist scientist authority pandemic. geologist doctorate doctor authority pandemic. Bill Gates former software developer make sense argument? Simpsons taught us nothing else infinite number Springfields US.

Especially older relative really wants come see knows risks. grandmother still gathering year (I won‚Äôt going reasons she‚Äôs 85 it‚Äôs business wants risk it). stay safe too. :)

By blaming, mean ""start wars"" blaming, ""what actually happened"" would nice know. start Italy? mink stuff that's coming light, maybe actually mink farmer Wuhan/China nothing it?

I think we're actually different thoughts: controlling ""eradicating"" 99% resources focused right now, everyone's day job vaccines working ER. sleep Great War 2011-2017? Lol  first urgent battle fight get seniors vaccinated bring death toll least 80% according figures. Well, least might buy us summer 2021 get enough people vaccinated effects year's COVID fatigue end causing another summer spike. long Daddy Fauci says ok sign up. activate National Guard military? huge portion folks hanging around military bases training. Yet crisis looking relief workers. Yes did. However may genetic factor makes less susceptible well. virus seems hit groups harder others. I‚Äôve avoiding outside contact 6+ months people can‚Äôt even miss ONE Thanksgiving!?!?! wrong idiots? essentially year. remember first rumblings China worrisome novel virus around Thanksgiving/Christmas. time vaccine actually distributed average citizen get it, year. We...are...FUCKED! Yeah imagine there‚Äôs case vaccinating working adults early since they‚Äôre primary ‚Äòspreaders‚Äô virus. Thatd interesting H model performance rated 23K feet carry cargo (33k empty aircraft) know across whole country, anyone one nearby go Menards. enforcing masks even states even moved requirement.

I saw someone pull mask one staff made beeline three isles tell put back up. anything do? job exposed covid last Wednesday. test Monday scheduled symptom free far. I‚Äôd like 14 days read recommended even get negative test. also already applied covid related leave still pending. Anything else coworkers protect quarantined properly? mean, got point there; might work. know plenty people work straight able afford kinds gas prices *right now*, even get money back next year. moderna vaccine single dose. makes sense terms know. clinical trials designed catch unexpected. However, clinical trials powerful number patients cases successful clinical trials catch low percent chance serious complications. 

The calculus risk versus benefit estimated fairly high precision big enough trial, bigger trials cost time need balance two things. I'm naive trials whether created big enough trial comfort. trust FDA, though.

So, understand making mandatory, especially since traditional vaccines pipeline. said, ask take mRNA vaccine day Emergency Use approval, might skip minute probably saying yes. asked take day BLA/NDA approval, minute would probably second. we're waiting FDA approval, approved now? FDA taking weekend off? 

What exactly FDA doing, anyone know? I'd assume FDA loop following progress every step way, ready stamp approval soon results came in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The results in! Please tell waiting Monday, business day approve. going get covid spitting finger... Yes, scientists today smarter, thats Damn, good idea! thought one. pretty much time leave house definitely cut half. Thanks!  Masks alone beat pandemic, useful single component good overall strategy like testing, isolating cases, tracking cases clusters, reducing social contact, social distancing securing borders. 

This something Europe general absolutely failed do, despite pandemic starting 1 year ago. 

You can‚Äôt blame masks failing stop second wave people freely travelling within EU (people‚Äôs holiday important fighting pandemic according EUs reckless promotion tourism summer) , still going bars restaurants schools remain open. governments across Europe EU blame failing learn lessons first wave. still understand European governments unified track, trace isolating system, every country running show totally failed almost every conceivable way (except Iceland, Finland Norway) . one experts warned day :‚ÄùThose disregard rules celebrate prepare small funeral afterwards.‚Äù Misinformation internet fcked human brain feelings Texas. They're either conservatives made bed liberal went jobs policies made conservatives. Umm, thanks...but that's much easier said done, bud. economic maelstrom horizon, last thing I'm going count politicians rescue me. However, I'll never forget country WHOLE turned back us, many us end pretty jaded result. Becoming expat road may viable option. public government give flying fuck you, time leave. Woops, think meant reply person you.  I've looking kinds official reports think explains it. Can't say sure course, that's I'm curious serious research. Parts USA (morbidly) starting remind month python sketch. 

""Bring dead!"" surprising think many westerners still indoctrinated white man's burden shit imperialism really actually good ""savages"". [This long think person European, American. find many Europeans also issues bigotry/racism/etc., claiming moral high ground compared Americans. However, posturing falls apart moment take look Europeans treat *their* minorities.

For part, people west continue think superior east, say sorts stuff reflect sentiment. single mom getting diagnosed canver 11, 17, 22 30 gave lot neutrality. imagine Trump president then. least twitter Lol yeah. I'm 3 4 generations removed anyone born China confirm Chinese culture obsessed money.

When westerners make film China like Mulan honor filial piety. western RPG games like World Warcraft create Chinese region game. Chinese make computer game like Genshin Impact? get Liyue (basically China game) find literally worship God money. LOL, Chinese telling like is.

There Chinese stand comedian said Chinese obsession money extreme new year actually wish ""Happy New Year"" literally wish prosperity (hope get rich). NZ huge islands

Does really matter population heavily concentrated urban areas? talking Australians/New Zealanders equally spread-out throughout country? 3 monkey children? Can't cage ? 


Oh right child protective laws. Forget those. K name used Automods trigger list autoremoval I'm positive saying think Americans common sense it. hoping go full tard it. understand logic since makes additional negative impact life - might well. said right start year. way stop it‚Äôs tracks literally whole world stopped moving couple weeks. 

It would logistical nightmare well planned everyone access needed survive couple weeks could possible stop movement virus. Republicans committed leave country worst possible shape Biden.

One point though. seems much USA even want try slow spread. 

There nothing stopping implenting many measures Australia. Masks, house visits, restricted numbers indoor dining. Ect. 

Obviously much came politics imo pretty disgusting. Hundreds thousands lives could saved. Many traveling surprise 6 extra feet I‚Äôve enjoying zoom calls friends every bit much would sit pub.  still social interaction without physically present Well think 400,001 cases Christmas  Frozen Bat meat??? even that, government western countries constitutional rights citizens well functioning media contend with. simply cannot impose kind restrictions example China can. Imagine would happen US government would start weld people shut houses going door door literally kidnap everyone fever. never happen explains success Asian countries. Another issue Asian countries well developed Healthcare e systems pandemic goes largely undetected many countries. Nevermind fact would pretty naieve think COVID spread literally every country earth, provinces China. Lastly western governments companies researched treatments clinical best practices halved time spent hospital significantly reduced mortality rate. Finally technoligally adcanced Western vaccines bring epipemic halt.

Holy shit lulz.

1. Chinese government mass welding people shut homes going door door kidnapping people fever. might well make exaggeration US government going around shooting people dead homes grabbing streets, that's regular occurence (it's not, even though happening.

2. **Many** East Asian countries better healthcare systems US. Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, significantly better healthcare systems. look testing per capita, countries far better. conclusion ""going undetected"" fails stop think two seconds.

3. Look mortality rate COVID. notice no, [western countries better eastern 

4. need provide proof so-called technologically advanced western vaccines (what even mean)?  Everyone gets it, see reason give protect them. Something something I‚Äôm liberal tall horse biden put house fire. ignored 30 min, time spread house. instead putting fire house, thing complain 3 days china put fire time house burning down. ""The East"" isnt country direction.  many countries ""The East"" various track records human rights issues.  think mandatory masks public places human rights violation would explain two things, assuming youre States America going implode stupidity ego average American.

As private insurance works... goooood fucking luck. realize you‚Äôre employee, get ZERO insurance? even employed, offer whatever insurance want you.

Children 12 seem get sick often, there's much need vaccinate them. see they're vaccine trials children 12 older though, likely get sick.

For record, I'm saying children 12 never get sick spread COVID. Reopening schools bad idea. I'm kind person actively avoids news current events, I've tallying numbers spreadsheet daily since March (locally, nationally, globally). pandemic one thing able get start watching local news (although ragequit ran segment telling people wearing masks *too much*). pandemic. normal circumstances. Normal rules apply. I'm sick hearing it, I'm sick people sensationalized drawing attention records broken. I'm way trying downplay tradgey situation. think news outlets stupid telling us we're day older yesterday. True virus started Vietnam, would numbers look? happened many asian countries? Albertsons deal. got turkey Smith's (Kroger's) 47 cents pound. need $100s worth stuff would hit Albertson's. Seriously. NO!!!!! US pays healthcare though I‚Äôm definitely keeping note left scathing message Facebook post. sheer ignorance appalling. seem understand I'm saying. irrelevant dense individual cities are, fact thousands miles large cities, oceans around country. infinitely easier contain virus geographical situation. infinitely difficult contain virus countries land borders cities large amounts physical interaction. course, *some* people may live Sydney work Melbourne absolute minority. Many people however live one city France work another. possible close Victoria almost entirely self contained. People largely need travel Victoria South Australia daily, kept home supported economically open states.

Take Queensland example. outbreak there, could cut whole state could supported economically rest Australia. 

I'm saying Australia good job, I'm saying far easier Europe Well course end it. cure. Come now, would invade Chad evidence Myanmar behind holidays alone funerals family.

Get ready disowned refuse show funeral too. Nah, credit given due. one, India MUCH younger population. Germany proactive either. yes NZ, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia Laos done better. look many people died NZ per capita compared countries. whole ""other factors"" keep bringing probably countries mentioned dealt SARS learned it. Cambodia Vietnam particular excellent systems place. Moaners stuck repeat. point, there's part feels wrong, want hateful anti mask idiots first beneficiaries vaccines. one too!! It‚Äôs easy, it‚Äôs fun!!! red hat goes well red mask üò∑ completely agree additional people adds danger, however it‚Äôs sliding scale. dad lives alone driving see isn‚Äôt going 20 person thanksgiving dinner. least opinion, reasonable risk. two? thought something we'd get regularly, like 3 6 months, depending vaccine. Sounds like bargain given potential benefits. cousin Korea; said she‚Äôs getting lot text alerts this, people fine ~$80 wearing mask public. Meanwhile US, friends claim masks don‚Äôt work public health measures violate right. Covid really rubbed noses ways we've wrong. future relies telling overworked, underpaid, demoralized people sit beige box stare wall months. Oh, even going get help it.

WELCOME CAPATALISM That's kind point though, reasons saving economy would use lock down? Sweden still fared marginally worse Denmark like Sweden piggie bank draw from... Piggie bank still borrow quatatively ease stimulate economy covid... Sweden did. Tell love Fauci says get together. get together either. No!! Exactly. could've isolated lead thanksgiving. wankers simply refuse believe shit's bad ""hey either 9 months cease live, pick one"" do. thrown around doctors (primary care, neurologist, pain management) year research demanded see rheumatologist. diagnosed condition first visit, officially imaging lab work. fast compared people end waiting 10 years onset symptoms diagnosis ankylosing spondylitis.

1. Trial participants reward risking bacon everyone else vaccine
2. Frontline workers (health/emergency etc.)
3. 2 groups said debatable made point maybe vaccinating working age population first USA among countries highest number tests. Nearly 6 10 people tested far. world just. Bad things happen people wrong thing. happen. far less control lives futures care think thankful family end getting know deliver them. oh wow. thanks. Like living two different worlds.

Because are. Half country faith-based belief system half reality-based belief system.

Trying unify country fool's errand. Bad headline. head phase 3, said expect least 60%. CDC defected ""No shit Sherlock"" news? know everything virus now, spending time money reiterating things March/April? Basically good productive member society pay lots taxes, try fun.

The line UK anything goes work. China higher population India yet 4.6k deaths. Everybody defending west's approach prove point. someone living Germany say yes, better european countries still poor compared east Asia. New deaths germany rise. One thing looking deaths also life moving west vs east Asia. China close restrictions Europe almost every country lockdown again. lawyer probably would done much better media personality have. Correlation causation, certainly randomised trial. means counties found effective measures, others not. Face masks may cause, may indicator both. Good luck USA. can‚Äôt see won‚Äôt get worse. Really worse. Mid December stats going insane. 

Hope I‚Äôm wrong. assuming elderly nursing homes home unable take care themselves. elderly usually 60-65+ means come contact people everyone else does.

That's makes sense elderly vaccinated first. Well, I‚Äôm european I‚Äôve seem US make kind weird claims possible medications last year. impressed.

And vaccines seem 95% effective less 50 USD apiece. way better medication (small survival benefit something). owners country give fuck people all. Wait telling masks don‚Äôt work governments also open schools, promote EU tourism, allow bars clubs one wears masks? 

It‚Äôs almost like several measures needed successfully fight virus. read comments I‚Äôm surprised pandemic situation bad many western countries, people governments totally clueless! wonder East Asians look West wonder ‚ÄúWhy difficult them?‚Äù 331 million people deeper going on.

Government competence. Nothing political leaning, ideology economic systems. Authoritarian countries run well (or badly), like liberal democracies. Capitalism, democracy, communism whatever nothing competent government is. many deaths acceptable you? BLOOD BLOOD GOD Yooo they‚Äôre paying people $27/hr bury bodies owned one car family entire life. 

My car ten years old. oldest car friend group. Even working retail, co-workers brand new cars. Yes, wages lower now. many people terrible money. 

People downvoting saying want want hear. landscaping cousin inside? seen ICU ER? hospital looked quiet covid surge. Visitors allowed in, patient procedures halted, general ‚Äúmy knee hurt 8 months‚Äù bullshit stopped coming ER. 

However, ICU, originally 12 rooms, went 36 rooms, everyone intubated. pure chaos hell there. worked ER ‚Äúdirty‚Äù areas, covid patients possible covid patients seen, also hell. generally areas non-covid people, pretty much empty. ""work hard strike lucky fortune"" mindset common stereotype poor European immigrants prior WW1 seems embedded culture.

What part New Zealand planning moving to? People probably downvoting tendency people fall two distinct camps (just like political divisiveness). ""LOCK EVERYTHING vs FLU DONT NEED ANYTHING!!""

You're 100% right government aint shit us businesses going flout rules fight back restrictions we're getting bailed (I small gym business I've moved house visits online).

Arguing harsh lockdowns would absolutely way go government would actually fucking help us. Although Ive pivoted business model many others cannot much wonder they're getting shit unemployment insurance that's they're staying open. Yep I'm sure plays huge part. redditors social lives always love hating people fun, another way it. .... electricity,sewer,garbage,hospitals....the world can't shut . would kill covid ever could American here. Propagandist believe Conservatives problem look florida staunchly red dense population surge cases. let bots make decisive issue left vs right. talking ass blame political party.

In US States responsibility put measures place. Deaths fall state level, federal one. Unless ready deliver 300 million aren‚Äôt enough ready don‚Äôt care one get would prefer effective safest. think one win. similar, want one get fastest.  Well mean seems like lot people I‚Äôve spoken recently think suggestion thanksgiving oppression *‚Äùthe guv‚Äôments gunna stop thanksgiving‚Äù* see there‚Äôs significant reduction. Darwin, never cease amaze. Always 

üåéüë®‚ÄçüöÄüî´üë®‚ÄçüöÄ killing annoying little brat cousin pipe dream thanksgivings past. year, on. Typical attitude try win argument describing *who am* person calling ""touchy defeatist"" decided ""am helpless."" can't wait that's thing anymore, really distracting makes impossible person even hear saying. 

If stop immediately attacking people's character telling them*what are* using mocking language, (even regarding yourself) like ""boohoo"" would surprised much people listen. think going vaccinate people administering vaccines *first*?

There absolutely issues things control comes time vaccinate, doubt one them... idiot

I believe Fauci said start pandemic something like ""The measures take seem extreme time seem like enough afterwards"". 

When someone spent lifetime studying worrying pandemics says something like worth listening IMO. Way many people also understand first 7 months represent worst could look like - low death rate we've able maintain healthcare system. like large waves hitting beach we've got tsunami coming in. (imported frozen food) best guess New Zealand came new cases 2 months ago? You‚Äôre thinking Clearwater lol. Opposite coast people hop airplanes too. Florida hospitalizations seem relatively low, though? Better northeast states even. young people, problem arises if/when interact risk individuals. Uh no, one misinforming anyone, didn‚Äôt read title article properly. like support lockdowns care children dying Africa thanks negative economic impact lockdowners' agree. great week! /r/unexpectedthanos I‚Äôm likely wear masks quite frequently. 

No one see mouth, I‚Äôm sure hurts way all. Human nature. would've thought? Goodbye Yep, know bunch people still college would weekend trip cities bars opened party. one girl took friends plane Las Vegas celebrate birthday past weekend Particularly cases people die homes haven‚Äôt ever tested hospital, may counted Covid deaths aren‚Äôt investigated. Probably every county different approach cases, would blood work would autopsy many would simply marked unknown cause something else. whole shit (if ever ends), really needs audit companies behavior this.

There needs consequences blatant disregard human life.

Have found something new yet? think also flu, so... go get virus won‚Äôt get again. whole family already it. 4 people globally gotten twice they‚Äôve asymptotic second time. Don‚Äôt let fear ruin life. I‚Äôm biggest bernie gal ever painfully inaccurate lol Fuck. Off. With. That. Shit.

Fucking vampires looking blood every turn. isn‚Äôt fucking Botox shot it‚Äôs potentially life saving medicine global fucking health crisis. Miss money shit. Hand fucking shit save lives. Fuck profits ‚Äúsitting beige wall months‚Äù isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs asked people though. least anymore. message since least May consistently ‚Äúwear mask, socially distance, eat/drink outdoors‚Äù getting people incredibly difficult. definitely agree Covid shone harsh light wealth disparity US, also shone harsh light selfish people be. ‚Äúsurge‚Äù read last week still 40% normal Thanksgiving. many Traveler‚Äôs kids coming back colleges going remote. 

It‚Äôs exactly back system. idea many expats visit hospitals every day, video calls relatives later? corrupted? Florida worse average state right now? every problem significant enough warrant mandates sweeping social disruption.

If guess, long think would take pandemic exact toll terms loss life population-adjusted level Spanish Flu? Yes, is, lots different angles converges around 5-10x undercount.

Such evidece includes ratios confirmed covid cases positive antibody results. E.g. NYC 300k confirmed covid cases yet 25% 8.5 million antibody positive, 2.1 million infections 7x confirmed cases.

You get similar numbers comparing case mortality rates many studies looking infection fatality rate. US case mortality rate currently stands 2.3%, latest paper October estimates INFECTION (NOT CONFIRMED CASE) fatality rates 0.23%, pointing 10x factor undercounting.

Care share evidence least reasoning it?  son school March way September... Tried put back rules defining we'd take back things got bad enough. Fair say, things gotten pretty bad since. 1 25 Fl *waves* comment section mess. No, terrible public transportation, low pop density. much country could probably prevent catastrophic spread significant measures place. Driving privilege right bad government messaging throughout this, want coming anything. Trump‚Äôs rich friends incentive help people losing apartments, every incentive poor people stop spreading shit upper middle class feel safe spend money economy again. Vaccinating everyone willing get jabbed absolutely happen. people survived Covid: ""See, deadly!"" Everything I‚Äôve read suggests supply chain issue time around. People selfish hate better frickin‚Äô parade nurses doctors. come many thinking quitting now? What's changed? curious!

P.S. nice username misspelled ""bogus"" aka least 10M dead Chinese would let run free, economic turmoil like West virus hoax, also Chinese created it! 

/s wish wasn‚Äôt needed

The reality Americans this. Barely cared begin now? Nine months later? 90% people don‚Äôt care, aren‚Äôt even willing entertain conversation it. literal tossup whether old blessing curse comes record. feels like needs compensate done bad / wrong eyes \[Which said crime bill wrote\] may super progressive even Executive Orders, he's like old people he'll entrenched ways may see anything sort.

Hoping former, expecting expecting latter. Reinfection possible. currently enough data know reinfection rare common. high standards determine, lack measures taken accurately view criteria, (like lack testing early on, infrequency sequencing genomes, etc) likely know common uncommon long time.

We also know common resurgences are, proven well. Meaning could infectious weeks months tested negative.

Immunity variable. sterilized immunity. always susceptible getting again. know timeline frequency that. need to, Florida free. I'm legally required wear clothes leave house. can't legally drink walking driving anywhere. car street legal insured. required current license want drive. Anyone car wear seatbelts children certain age size car seat. dog leashed leave house her. fair drinking drug use charts year compared every year life , drink get high couch though. Pre-pandemic always bought big packs (24 32 packs depending store) didn‚Äôt buy often. It‚Äôs usually (but always!) better value. I‚Äôm buying 4-packs every week it‚Äôs annoying they‚Äôre one week we‚Äôre actually risking running out. Whatever, bring on, care point. Look. husband fly every week (we long distance) , even COVID. That's 50+ flights since COVID. Wet caught COVID. add one anecdote mean get COVID fly, one anecdote mean certainly get COVID fly. 

I take precautions isolate best (no dinners, minimal shopping trips, make, hand washing, etc) going apart husband knows long, going ask apart kids he's going ask apart son (we live apart due children currently live, long story). Everyone needs safe, sand sure, travel vacation, us still travel. Thank much thoughtful response! third bullet interesting. get tested weekly bullet two, realize still may fool proof. Also, must know dad makes mission never stop ;) lol pass along. Thanks again! online ordering want get sick, feel bad delivery person forcing expose week so. ""masks : better breath mint"" wife's work usually flu shots brought free company employees. sure already got weekly covid testing employees take pretty seriously Yeah, you‚Äôre ignoring tragedy commons aspect this.

So get sick need go hospital, don‚Äôt go. everyone get sick shouldn‚Äôt go either.

Obviously doesn‚Äôt work 100% need top approach pandemic. People don‚Äôt seem capable calculating assessing second third order effects.  Cases low area long time. I‚Äôm working home haven‚Äôt movie restaurant anything since March. Grocery store trips mask hours wasn‚Äôt high risk. feels like is. 3 weeks ago. Granted 3yo pre-school big deal levels education. decided going get bad, going get sooner rather wait around someone school becomes infected concerned health. sure, need ear I'd glad chat pm anytime huge family I've worried them. terrible see family active, nothing almost three weeks. Always working yard cleaning cars visiting neighborhood.
The father told getting thru it. So... it‚Äôs cheaper get vaccination test.

Sounds right üòÇ anyone seem like Emperor's new clothes? I've never seen anything beautiful. know anyone can't see idiot, right? mean, they're CLEARLY amazing. Get loser we're building global totalitarian regime. blast anti-maskers.  pretty large social life still dont even know anyone knows anyone ""virus"" fuck talking wearing masks?!?!

HAHAHAHAH

Dude, crazy bad feel you. Like said, ruled FEAR ANGER. pity you.

I specifically wrote people stay home. working home staying indoors year, angry little child. left home month.

But point OP ALSO spread misinformation -- even good intentions -- makes edges see OP deceptive person. everyone suffers.

Awwwwww I'm sorry child pissed off. Grow figure yelling wrong person, dullard.

Really, hope world have, people stupid notice enemies are? Actually air doesn‚Äôt recirculate airplane. It‚Äôs constantly refreshed. haven‚Äôt reading. 


The cashier already going exposed. come contact many people. 

Shouldn‚Äôt people behind gas station sanitizing pump?

In fact contact exposure limited. Mostly transferred directly. 

You operating lot outdated information. 

But NONE matters accepted risk travel accepted risk travel anyone come contact well. 

If stay inside you‚Äôll fine. don‚Äôt come outside us favor.  matter, families would still seriously impacted. need least 1m dead happen. Easy. Exactly. People always want drink bars. I'm going cry current ones closing. Others open.  town, major bar owners RAGING assholes. wish every one dickheads would find poorhouse.  

I cry service industry *workers*. deserve form aid. Maybe didn‚Äôt express clearly. meant say opposite thought. meant didn‚Äôt put big ticket items hold like kids. wife self isolating friends family since March. don‚Äôt even go grocery store - pick up. like 95% mask adoption rural community and, cases rising, still ok. fully expect immediate household make unscathed we‚Äôve followed guidelines since start. still go hike lot we‚Äôre usually ones go. 

I‚Äôm sure got wrote statements hope clears up.  I‚Äôm hopeless? what? I‚Äôm sheep? Let guess, you‚Äôre minimum wage server restaurant fucking future you‚Äôre trying tell sheep, people like ask hard hitting questions. live rural area issues traffic thus drive. yeah point tragedy commons. mandate way this, personal responsibility way rational self interested actor always break rules they're suggestions without enforcement. covid subreddit people anxiety depression learn coping strategies? feel verge complete breakdown. Notable comment - vaccine trials establish whether conferred immunity prevented onward transmission well disease, logistically possible (you would regularly monitor every trial participant find asymptomatic infections).

So vaccine rollout need carefully judged, restrictions may need place everyone vaccinated. 4 days ago MN rooms full Leave Canada please  Ignorance bliss Think hospitals healthcare workers pieces shit! don‚Äôt think wide scale vaccination public start spring 2021. relatively people get first dose vaccine December wouldn‚Äôt expect protective immunity sometime January earliest.

The logistics getting hundreds millions doses vaccines (which require -70 F {Pfizer} even -7 F {Moderna}) incredibly challenging. think hospitals research universities/institutions figure - yes. I‚Äôm sure drug stores, grocery stores, county health offices, doctor‚Äôs offices places people usually get vaccines at. extreme sub zero temperatures - businesses massive scale cryogenic storage.

I suspect Jansen Astra Zeneca vaccines (if approved early next year) may end vaccine choice since don‚Äôt require extreme cold RNA vaccines do. bet people happiest though. would argue 99% news isn‚Äôt going affect much. Obviously 1% probably important, it‚Äôs important enough hear means. 

But I‚Äôd also argue 99% social media pretty worthless too. would look dog died?? Another reason stay home. used work rural hospital. 4 ICU beds, hospital within 50 mile radius. Nearest major center 7 hours away ambulance bad roads, helicopter service frequently unavailable due weather conditions.

On good day (pre covid), one two ICU beds would occupied. Traumatic brain injuries, sepsis, post-op cases, usual. good day, four would occupied. 

On bad day would patients ICU beds would spend precious hours desperately trying arrange transport either major center one rural hospitals 2-3 hours away, steadily deteriorated front us. absolute worst days, none hospitals would beds available either, nowhere send them. would explain panicking families going on, best could regular ward setting could find ICU bed. Many make it, never stop wondering anything else could done them. pandemic.

Now put covid picture. This, said previous comment, going pretty. You‚Äôre fucking retarded part reason US heading civil war There‚Äôs reason developed countries places can‚Äôt Victoria (noting Victoria place within Australia locked hard since worst outbreak - wasn‚Äôt whole country).

I don‚Äôt get people think it‚Äôs difficult. stay home. Relax. Hell, lot people it‚Äôs nice break work. Note obviously combination government paying people‚Äôs income ensuring jobs safe. think *thats* Americans think it‚Äôs impossible. They‚Äôre missing sides coin: well enforced lockdowns, financial support people want actually comply rules. Obviously one going obey lockdown means can‚Äôt get food table pay rent.  People downvoting makes sense. stop? 

DUI dangerous. Performing brain surgery drunk also dangerous. smart-ass doctor guy says he's perfectly capable driving cutting brains open drinking bottle vodka? tricky part maybe is. next one be? personal choice? go people reckless things *after* prove harmed others? try prevent happening?

And situations practically impossible prove individual guilt? 

We know party like likely spread disease. know people attended infect others families, workplaces, shops etc. People choice, freedom all. get house buy groceries, know there's risk I'll catch COVID-19. that's calculated risk. happen upon someone big party week before, risk much greater. I'll never able know prove ones harmed negligence.

Now, maybe conscientious party-goer ever. Maybe live next door club come contact people accepted risk. *we know* that's case everyone. point common sense. Freedom great, people right drive cars blindfolded. Like get it. live Orlando, miss going downtown Wall Street area weekends huge block parties bars restaurants. get it. 

But fuck guys cmon. doesn‚Äôt help governor absolute tool isn‚Äôt shutting anything minus mansion (I mean virus isn‚Äôt big deal reopen place family lives public tours?). 

Love things Florida hate detrimentally dumb people here.  defy lockdown virus care. shopping habits changed since started March... wrong Bill. Lockdown forever /s Yep somehow think Canada they‚Äôre never going get , won‚Äôt cross border via human human transmission start spreading .

Boy they‚Äôre surprise . Spanish flu mutated common annual flu. Every year mutated enough bypass immunological response. time combo both, time tell extent damage be.  you‚Äôre saying need hack hacker? woulda fantastic nine months ago one trying keep relevant.

\- big retailers made bank small businesses (AKA competition) destroyed.

\- Online delivery Amazon making bank people afraid shop meat world due fearmongering.

\- economy dies, seized repossessed assets (like homes) come market pennies dollar - held flipped profit later.

\- Tech companies making killing building new social credit/surveillance dystopia.

\- ""They"" bought governments, lock, stock, barrel. return unlimited powers seized, governments going kick bailouts crony-capitalist masters, paid (see airlines example).

Everyone wins. Except Joe Average. people power want be. think Republicans pretty much higher education ""tool liberals""  Good live fear""

That mentality pure, baseless instinct. like, ""live free die."" somebody told person jump bridge dangerous, would prove could? air literally poison, would people still go outdoors ""refuse live fear""? think significant part problem human brain's struggle grapple threats can't see, programmed respond to. would wager that, statistically speaking, people use preventive measures virus likely type capable rational analysis animal-based instinct. million people traveling plane still enough huge spike. good chance someone infected every plane, 1 million possible new spreaders days, spread virus wherever traveling, bring back home.  wonder need hoard much TP, two assholes clean Accurate data? pulled 1/10 number ass. could still get virus, exhibit symptoms mild ones. ugh.... feel bad people's grandmas logic anyone attended BLM protest, Biden party, womens march cause media loved didnt wear mask (as many didnt) denied care

Cant saying 'selfish people thanksgiving' denied care election multiple states mass gatherings occurred

 tell mass gatherings fine anything else selfish means denied care hope allowed first rounds vaccine look like carelessness. idiocy, pure simple. think UBI good idea, again, complicated.  idea giving UBI people quarantine home implement UBI, get people quarantine? happy get little UBI check stay home, mean YOLO'ing potential increased pay? UBI come catch police presence checking people's homes make sure locked inside quarantining? we're shutting airlines roads idiots travel country go Thanksgiving Christmas dinner? institute rules grocery stores deliver food limit occupancy stores? 

I know at, South Florida back March closed non-essential businesses list ""essential"" business. list business types considered essential massive. scale back essential essential business? services essential essential businesses need operate?

It's Complicated. grandmother pin says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm polio pioneer!‚Äù part clinical trial polio vaccine child. told said ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know mother thinking.‚Äù Paging Charles Darwin problem go away, under-reported.
So, look forward time goes by. cities around reporting running beds. Wichita kansas ran nurses, topeka beds patients hallways lobbies waiting beds, kansas city almost last time checked. kansas still refusing masks trying understand people think somehow would happen? American public follow government advice? Exactly. Say take gamble someone Thanksgiving virus spreads around family. affect old folks ready willing die. Younger family members may end long term effects. Family members later going lives exposing public. know elderly family member gets sick, they're necessarily going accept chosen fate die isolation home. probably seek medical attention symptoms get bad expose healthcare workers process. ""I choose fate"" scenario. involves many people get say choice. Looking florida curve still.pretty low swinging up. I'm gonna say second wave hit December January they're gonna spread back rest US everyone says 'florida beat covid'. Dude infection rates still low enough packed bars.... American agree you. Sorry. always chance catch mutated form virus. weeks months pass, antibodies flee body, could catch COVID again

""normalcy"" create Yep. mom cancelled plans go Florida winter. survive happen get one, getting shirt says I'm spicy monkey. know words made smile, badly needed something smile today.  Trump + DeSantis= buffoons do. ""if right, think unnecessary."" guys plan eating drinking? That's bit misleading covers infections present date. current case rate relevant discussion. (""Is Florida worse average state right now?"") Try looking Florida hope nice time, whats next could bad time them. Exactly no, could compromise Get best mask never take outside. look like Mad Max N95 swim goggles whenever need go interior building. Fuck people. ""personal responsibility"" clearly abject policy failure

Which required auto insurance, paying taxes fund fire company optional... knew behaving properly pandemic would need regulated, too? Guys, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm icu nurse hospital critical staffing shortages nurses getting sick family members. offering double time every time shift 12/31. NEVER happens. They‚Äôre super stingy double time. It‚Äôs going get worse. Please safe stay home wear mask. Ugh. don‚Äôt want ICU! Don‚Äôt blame US public‚Äôs covid fatigue me, lol. Many people fed it, obviously. Hard afraid 8 months straight. ""I three kids money. can't kids three money"" personally give fuck anymore. nowhere go, nobody see, nothing much worth worrying about. goes. yeah, follow mask laws, ligaf. 35.... literally around 2000 died 12 million known cases ....you fine I‚Äôve quarantine fatigued long I‚Äôve reached weird state acceptance, like stare laptop ten hours day homework drawing, don‚Äôt talk anyone, barely think really. hardly notice days passing point. It‚Äôs weird. get freaked grocery store see nostril. still real lot people. boss traveling see family. thinks ""safe"" knows one person personally got covid. Wat money Anyone know last year travel air count was? would assume higher? Damn homie, pissed cheerios push politics me, pal. Trump's virus Democrats handled perfectly. Look California Illinois Oregon! Covid paradise. Ttyl, I'm late lip injections. Unless Kentucky's legislature passed law preventing company liable.

Besides, court would probably require someone prove got virus restuarsnt, sole cause death regardless issue. old ""tobacco *necessarily* cause lung cancer"" excuse.  funny even need look China, Japan literally done nothing still looks like nothing happening here. Well, virus numbers slightly rise lately too, let's see long lasts, even Japan undercounting death rates 10 times, still less deaths Germany per capita hilarious (i.e. Even x10 Japan's current death count, would still slightly lower death per capita rate Germany) No, got ‚Äúmidterm‚Äù rental realtor. vacation rentals, ‚Äúmidterm rentals (3-6 months),‚Äù long term rentals (like would normally simply lived somewhere). lack travelers year, midterm rentals like long term rentals price wise lot cheaper hotel airbnb. Actually home rented slightly able get place there. Fucking idiots.

Opening bar? Idiots.

Not state-wide mask policy? Idiots.

Not enforcing COVID restrictions city? Idiots.

Partying bar? Idiots.

If like called idiots die mad, fuckfaces. add that, people wearing mask \*will\* verbally attack wearing one yourself.  
Remember governor North Dakota got teary asking people cut one another slack? 
  asking anti-mask people stop shaming berating people wearing mask!  Regular meat farmers aren‚Äôt really much better That's spirit! statement, waste time arguing anti-science idiots. article:

In 2009, Obama administration disbursed 85 million respirators S.N.S. combating H1N1 pandemic, failed effectively replace them, despite warned so. Trump administration also refill stockpile, ignoring admonitions public health officials pandemic-simulation test showed America would run disastrously short P.P.E. real thing occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

Is true?  future looks grim.. Really? Cheap enough?

Is feeling involved distribution vaccines? care share?

And list 100 vaccine candidates? wasn‚Äôt aware exact number, thought around dozen currently. Love feeling superior .  Awful. I‚Äôm sorry. learned back spring people screamed ‚ÄúOppression!‚Äù fucking mask mandate. say? definition insanity thing expecting different results. Yet, are. still risking life people get care. mom thankful security staff hospital protecting unnecessary visitors refused masks tried sneak visitors allowed. 

My heart breaks everyone working healthcare right now, general public putting effort keep safe. Punching wall absolutely abuse. see grow parent psychotic temper. Good you. did. Throwing shit punching walls made feel like walk eggshells times. never know going set off. Nobody live environment like that. GROWN ADULT control anger. normal. 

I'm gonna guess man ""punching wall"" comment. many men think type behavior normal. isn't. counseling

More like divorce attorney + supervised visitation one anger issues. **have people** too, refuse wear masks.

Glad few. pretty much entire community. feels awkward walk place mask 15 people without mask. owner, personally know, looking like underwear outside pants. becomes much sometimes. Dude. Take breath. arguement? initally replied another person entirely. came tell condescending wrong. 

I agree harder. feel always look ways improve situation. feel like saying nothing giving up. Opinions. are. 

I dont know all. attacking character? allowed opinions? No, statistical outliers. confirmed reinfections, trendlines conditions reinfected patients trend worse second time around. Thats science. due fucked physical condition lungs first infection hope people remove Earth  really hate place (the us) sometimes one thinks fucking easy fuck even fucking talking about? ever living shit fuck try use mental health defend Republican talking point lockdown pandemic would bad thing? 


Jesus fucking christ closing 200k reported cases day. real number cases lot god damn higher cause testing capacity still utter garbage. 


Everyone fucking suffering God damn year majority Americans want simply make prolonging bullshit. 100% selfish. What‚Äôs per dollar cost vaccine? Government going make everyone get it?

Should free least 5 bucks everyone afford it. believe death rate took us 9 months hit going quadruple month..... It‚Äôs crazy. One day... actually things better general. wife daughter owe hospital ~$3k. It‚Äôs crazy. whom? family wfh don‚Äôt go anything I‚Äôm pretty sure safely meal together hahaha Unless numbers keep rising.

They not. insane there's articles sub saying ""don't worry surfaces""

I've lost count many times China &amp; New Zealand breakouts cold chain food imports. (supposedly) 0 local cases.

Surfaces real vector. Especially cold. types coronavirus live YEARS freezer. How'd guess? tried, local businesses require masks. wearing mask chin considered ""liberal"". ""complained"" told ""stay home"". 

If wanted business, would suing governor defy mandates. Spanish flu killed 50-100 million 2 years. fake pandemic around almost year even 1/4th Indeed, as, reason, uncontrolled spread occurring locations likely without Biden dance parties, Dakotas. 

I find amusing many Reps gotten infected hoax virus thus far. Guess they‚Äôre pack betas all. Merry Christmas Relatives. brought back Covid pitch casket Grandma Grandpa. parish protests let kids go physical school -_- ..... kid stayed virtual, I‚Äôm nurse hospital working directly covid patients don‚Äôt want expose daughter even more, cause someone getting sick/dying, like u said maybe monkeys fly butt. 

Well, yes, sooner vaccinate American public virus better. 450 million doses 5-6 months? Yes done that. Maybe sit 15 feet apart something bit generous. man! already know something like happens again. Trump mismanaging thing literally solely blame are...and Europe. anti-science, ‚Äúfake news‚Äù bullshit spokesperson got us nothing else. Look countries one listens him. fuck die. think soldiers living heightened circumstances actually similar close levels daily stress etc live war zone soldiers world war. optimism normal sure soldiers good example normal. pretty revealing yes say least let's honest ...its always level. definitely fanned flames vanguard called disenfranchised. pandemic test failed test pretty badly. Hopefully look back point learn put charge. 50 states combined powers could get AMAZ shares split wrote true, US would already paid sick leave publicly funded healthcare system make sure workers best economy. Sadly, theres money made desperation obfuscation corporate goons happy profit way. case here? Possibly pans US always pays drug available. Well, may never around poison ivy again, ever found poison ivy works couple years ago video case since. Makes much sense guy visualizes it.  yeah.. I'm never going protest owning smart phone really matter. long serious benefits really care.

At costco able refuse sell customer revoke membership... There's many lines fine print signing membership. it. basically live normally mask. looks like 93% chance according study developed immunity close taking vaccine, feel comfortable saying basically took vaccine. It‚Äôs simply lot us got professions want help people. isn‚Äôt first last time get taken advantage it. Caring professions severely undervalued country.  Thanks response, concern. ease worries, I'm suicidal thoughts, feel like that's going happen. thought starting remote therapy, used see therapist person year ago (when moved new city). articles make wish COVID-19 deadly Ebola people selected naturally Source? curious bad avg Joe thought freedumbs wearing mask social distancing etc important. pays reddit duck joke comments, I'm happy learned something they‚Äôre confirmed doesn‚Äôt make outliers.

Not Reddit. issues one vaccine's effectiveness side effects, people get second better vaccine? that's exactly what's happening one hospitals believe wichita using er covid. hopefully one gets car accident way work using mouthwash effective? include -70¬∞C ultra-cold? understand link shows Florida worse rate average state, don‚Äôt you? I‚Äôve seen sick shit year man playing around timelines next level shit know what? close hospitals Florida? people refuse preventative measures states high infection rates clearly deserve medical assistance. seeing picture, can‚Äôt. Literally hate people rn. feel either like helpless parent watching child go buck wild goodie two shoe sibling watching control sibling get trouble.

Edit: grammar present don‚Äôt think would similar outbreak like Wuhan? many cases claiming deaths claiming happened Italy? would similar breakouts like Wuhan that‚Äôs originated. Wuhan easily epicenter. still denial maybe need help.  Reading comments makes feel like still March. suffer discomfort hopes better times ahead.

Which called wanting it, dumbass. Waiting months nothing, though. They‚Äôve already tested humans months. you‚Äôre truly worried , would long term complications (which nearly unheard of) case wait years. dead open inside   Deaths rise. get close around 1 million done. deadliest pandemic 100 years. get it, don‚Äôt care, that‚Äôs tragedy itself. Really great news. Hospital workers, essential workers, old high risk people get year early next year. rest people April, May - can't wait. 95% effectiveness, resume normal life even anti vaxxer threatening herd immunity. virus probably us long time come, low levels people vaccinated. ""recommend"" driving drunk Sweden. actual law. case, would lose much money. \[Whether vaccine distribution.\] Fuck cowboys No, division head neuro radiology division Stanford hospital years. FedEx Custom Critical, division refrigerated trucks already ship things to/for medical pharmaceutical sectors. Hahaha  would bad ass parachuted flew Blue Angels got vaccine.

I'll settle 18 year old sticking needle ass vaccine cold parking lot outside, thank service.

We nationalizing companies produce PPE. 

Those trying profit war tried murder. lowering probability getting completely avoiding risk still matter do. Early IGG studies UK suggested least 3.4 million cases lab confirmed case total closer widespread now, US also ignored lockdowns summer young people likely asymptomatic barely symptomatic necessitate testing, would make sense blew past 50 million cases months ago. H1N1 spread 60 million Americans less year less contagious airborne pathogen seasonal flu.

This isn‚Äôt measles, 90% chance catching area contagious person within two hours leaving, might close. airborne though, meaning cloth masks reduce viral load cannot prevent outright, N95 masks work sustainable protection close contact don‚Äôt any. people ejaculating chicken eggs how? No, that's works. axample. board flight, moron ahead contagious asymptomatic. way air recirculates plane, likely everyone now. and, sake argument, thirty percent passengers stay asymptomatic first fourty-eight hours. accepted risk lost, every person come contact getting it. cashier grocery store, sign get COVID, want literally freeze starve winter. Whomever comes behind gas station, perhaps, entire Wal-Mart. 
 
The point get make kinds """"personal decisions"""" every person infected wait another year argue politics aunt Pauline turkey mostly dry inedible anyway. ‚ÄúWe agree culture compliance CRUCIAL containing COVID-19, it‚Äôs critical ‚Äî faculty, students, staff ‚Äî comply call random testing,‚Äù Woods said email. ‚ÄúBut block students final week semester harmful, especially students risk. without letting faculty department chairs know resulted panic confusion.‚Äù 

This became major issue culture. seem know difference right wrong anymore. ""harmful"" block students comply mandatory rules given many chances ""not harmful"" students disregard rules.

This selfish/entitled culture created needs go. one defending students. given multiple chances comply, consequences them. learn responsibility. Actions consequences.  never completely safe, risk assessment individual make See, here‚Äôs thing, that‚Äôs true, mask related issues actually don‚Äôt follow political fault lines. know conservative people follow mask mandates religiously liberals say it‚Äôs total BS. different forces work educating populace priority. hope so, wrote bankruptcy bill doesn‚Äôt let claim bankruptcy student debt. Americans give zero fucks.  Yeah, lungs overrated. Peeing standing tho... Sounds like winning me. really should. really sucks since hospital system area severely limits employment options. I'm probably going go across river neighboring state new job. - twenty days outside contacts. Everyday leave house risks, don‚Äôt think government power force anyone anything. That‚Äôs Nice idea theory falls immediately hospital environment. I‚Äôve self-isolating since start. Literally single social event. probably got exposed hospital though. turn respiratory distress 2 weeks, shouldn‚Äôt get help? earth could ‚Äòscreen compliance‚Äô 4am Tuesday night packed A&amp;E ward waiting treatment. Look evidence: far, killed 100% *other* people. can't happen me! already agreed harder today. touchy defeatist? decided helpless nothing keep going best can. say worked me. literally birth new strain common cold. Learning live means going back 2019 normal acknowledging is. bizarre reason, psychopaths want restructure society revolve around 0.1% IFR virus. long obsessed it, treat like ebola, hideous dystopia continue. Social distancing, masks, harassment Covidians, lockdowns, testing, isolating, counting cases, contact tracing, plexiglass, temperature checks, disinfecting everything, proof vaccination, covid papers work travel (just like Nazi Germany!) rest psychotic stupid voodoo accepted part ""new normal"" one catches big, bad scary cold virus... apparently either never knew respiratory viruses existed, ""experts"" lobotomized back March, covid literally worst disease ever befall human race thus need completely change way live accommodate it. That's science says! word even mean anymore? Someone wake nightmare hell. beyond absurd point. shit even real? yet parents insist holiday party wouldn‚Äôt trust Chinese reports? surely motivated Agree. several area. Back 2009 went ER severe pain. Thought appendix (guess was). busy all. Yea, people nothing bad. 7 hours wheeled emergency surgery. 

My grams recently died hospital neglect (2019). nurses always phones got mad asked help change grandmas bedsheets wet one changed dressings 6 plus hours. nurses like this. guess hospital crap. Yeah, well hope part otherwise thank helping spread even possible take loved ones families. Good job. generally agree message (border control #1 defence, etc.), also I'd like point capitalist system necessarily lead late imposition restrictions, lockdowns necessarily required tools place, like contact tracing - see Taiwan example.

I wanted point much Asia prolonged lockdowns too; tell, long places Asia locked significant reopening (yes, criteria subjective) 

- Manila, 77 days
- India, 74
- Singapore, 73
- Thailand, 66
- Malaysia, 46  I've watching TWiV 5 months now. love watching Dr. Griffin's updates usually try watch little bit discussions Dr. Griffin's updates. 

I wish split video two videos, one Dr. Griffin's updates one discussions. reason say I've tried share videos many colleagues friends look length video automatically dismiss saying time watch three hour video. tell watch first 30 minutes, they've already made mind either watch video way all.

Also good hear Dr. Griffin fellow Soylent drinker. guess guys big undocumented refuges ""there always people worried and/or protect others covid, I'm doing. always people less worried proactive me."" way China blaming foreign sources. strange. Maybe end we're counting millions bodies, tornado leave permanent stain idea contradicting science cool anti-vax, anti-mask, etc. simple truth? us really stupid really selfish. really started talking people aren‚Äôt taking COVID-19 seriously, got harrowing perspective makes really understand bad problem is. One person insisted ‚Äúto lockdown see family betrayal American spirit free‚Äù ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt tell people country something we‚Äôll want more.‚Äù

It‚Äôs honest-to-god real stupidity. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm ashamed country. Try immune disease organ transplant year. I'd say US health care system (not workers experts, though) also zero consideration Americans, judging lack healthcare extortionate practices.

Americans know institutions zero consideration them, zero consideration institutions return. surprising IMO... Come Scandinavia! read comments, you‚Äôd see want people wear masks Thanks actual answer. wanted understand little better. still idea would meaningful comorbidity coronavirus. travel issue. Everywhere covid now. problem enclosed spaces unmasked family. using opportunity cook first turkey

Turkey jerky anyone? Sure, questioning whether throat swabs done covid. are. multiple parts world, since post responding referenced SE Asia I'm Canada. tests involve throat swab--a whole school local tested using gargling method--but many do. Yet, individuals question see potential millionaires potential paupers

I think Steinbeck put succintly, ""Socialism never took root America poor see exploited proletariat, temporarily embarrassed millionaires"" are, coutry, sub 2mil people, everything shut down, can't stay 9pm can't travel bewteen municipalities. take lots souls you.   Evil subjective quality. Subjectively, point view healthy society, kind people fine example evil. Yeah unfortunately I've witnessed thing. quite sadly honestly. saying them, seen.  share it? worst happen someone starts manufacturing vaccine people It‚Äôs people don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs care point inconveniences regular plans. Look boomers! /s Yea it‚Äôs gotten worse too. communities I‚Äôm liking niche hobby communities. attitudes website pathetic sad fucking things I‚Äôve ever read wish could lockdown go far closing borders neighboring stupid states. That‚Äôs cuz...‚ÄôMerica ‚ÄúI expect people conscious effect disease lives.‚Äù

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Theyll pry chicken-sicle cold dead hands Stats pointless. Let‚Äôs look data. one million cases week amount deaths, actually positive thing. want use ‚Äústats‚Äù, compare numbers March/April now. People lot smarter now. Notice headlines talk cases deaths. post Google Reviews maybe Glass Door record others see. word needs get shitty employers. get far much anonymity. Oh dear ...they're Turkeys people soon ... year west disclose virus since last September? NATO hold closed door meeting virus last November told no-one?

If west told China last September, spread there. guess that's point it?

The west fault virus spread, fault trying frame China. Unfortunately you, China believe forgiveness. Ok, Eritrea also 0 deaths. guess conclusion terms response it's

Eritrea = Cambodia Mozambique South Korea Europe Rightfully so. Wait won‚Äôt free?... I'm pretty sure theres lot people reddit think  China first report it, blaming first report discouraging future countries reporting pandemics happens, leading potentially disastrous situations would allow people infected unknowingly. [My comment melatonin actually really good OP rebutter definitely lost argument  health department free, drive clinics year. Make sure drive parents place. Flying rail dangerous. Also disinfect frozen packages It‚Äôs voter suppression, replacement labour slavery. Chinese New Year Thanksgiving completely different experiences. reason compare them. ""We worked put measures place advised chief health officer."" always defering expert. admirable watch comparison US.

That actually seem care others public. us... us sure.  think surprising ""nasty surprise"" may enough people willing take vaccine.I think therapeutics might viable path us returning normal. Narrator: didn't. many people think traveling Thanksgiving? many catch COVID unsuspectingly pass someone else holiday? questions responsible person cares rest humanity would ask something like this. like one dying it. thousand people day may seem like nothing some, maybe think old people going die anyway. talk percentages demographics day, but, end, 1k people day quarter million total country nothing. Hey, said Germany. looking German numbers compared Denmark lately. following pretty equally cases deaths per cap, case fatality rate increased lot. comes? Lack testing, going on? - guess testing, showing lot milder cases. 

Graphs You‚Äôve got wrong. It‚Äôs Americans much long act entitled. Yes poverty US, US people iPhones iPads considered poor. Americans today make sacrifices greater public good like several generations back. friends play regular board games discussion chat since board game days nixed year. US approached wrong completely reactive.

Oh crap, got bad, lock down.

Oh wait, economy, let's define essential....crazy enough everything entertainment became essential. got work home many business leaders like good portion still going work.

Congress passes bill 6 month spending window definitely concept lasting 2-3 months mind.

Economy unemployment go crap, let's open back up. Second wave hits portions South. Many places basically implement reduced capacity businesses outside bars / restaurants / entertainment hitting 80% day.

We get Fall, mid-West norther states start seeing growth. basically ignore Mid West threaten kidnap governor north...that seems like something people definitely doing.

Now we're November, numbers exploding everywhere, hospitals getting full everywhere ability spread patients bring doctors / nurses surges basically impossible getting burned out. we're going add Fall / Winter holidays travel next six weeks happening expect less disastrous outcome?

The worst part scientists literally preached entire time. ignored implement real lockdown March could Summer far similar Europe others things actually operational far greater capacity we're ignoring shutdown metrics that's going make far nightmarish be. implemented something support citizens basically keep home holiday season, we'd far control start roll vaccines.

The lack kind planning, strategy, execution utter failure here. lessons learned enormous growing. live either way. miserable one way. accept fate Cambodia 0 meant it‚Äôs worth travelling Yes Yup, true. NJ, teachers lumped second group (essential/critical workers) receive it. So, healthcare workers, general public. Given drama surrounding schools, makes sense teachers higher list. Fascist pig friends. person stuck coma rest life ""survived"" 

Just make mean long term consequences. modeling constantly checked reality adjusted. point modeling pretty accurate regardless understanding virus much. 

In lot cases look trends time determine trend going exactly need understand why.

That's pretty much world's stock markets work kind quantum mechanics works. understand observe changes everything look patterns. Speculations first person became infected (incubating) late October last year. Began infecting people November. mean, statistically, people aren‚Äôt going die Covid either, personal risk assessment made. 

Everyone makes risk assessments daily. guarantee there‚Äôs several risky things decide risk assessment tells it‚Äôs fine, bet find millions people think you‚Äôre stupid coming different conclusion personal risk assessment. 

But doesn‚Äôt make stupid. Perhaps true ‚Äústupid‚Äù people don‚Äôt understand simple concept instead conflate million different things order tell SPECIAL AMAZING GREAT! No, people immunocompromised can't get live vaccines, none Covid vaccine candidates live.

However, vaccines tested pregnant women young children, best knowledge.  imagine China handled virus, ""China LIED"" ""Ban Chinese travel"" crowd would lose minds. Almost like never actually China handled it. except China know everything never-before-seen virus day mutated, perfectly normal western countries cover September till March death blew everyone once. donating countries yes know natural antibodies (getting sick) go away 3ish months vaccine would last longer? r/avoidchineseproducts 
Please. Stay home don‚Äôt holiday shopping year. France starting think easing restrictions 17,000 cases day, Korea closing pubs nightclubs 300 cases day. people wonder west poorly Asia much much better. I'm pretty sure people understand Sweden (or rather do) things cause too. fed misinformation came wet market

Well certainly wrong conclusion hindsight, seeing know virus already circulating least Italy last September

But question nobody west tell world long? Let‚Äôs pretend vaccine doesn‚Äôt exist universe picture this

Canada stage USA at, conducting proper lockdowns. one Canada ‚Äúlocked-down‚Äù. please.

So USA example see Canada could potentially thriller. vaccine doesn‚Äôt help out, USA continue get cases Canada North America entirely dangerous.

Didn‚Äôt scientist say 40-60% world population would get it? Well least won‚Äôt coming Canada. rate I‚Äôll dead let back it‚Äôs really blessing disguise country  EU countries can't restrict travel EU citizens places surge came way halloween.

Where uptick became visible October 19th, state whole going slowly several weeks that.

Halloween election seem little influence fact - lines state county followed smooth exponential arcs without sign specific triggering amplifying events.  Gotta get shops open Christmas shopping! /s aslong every country next usa closes border fine  manipulation like makes people distrust science.

You trust reporting hides things 'for good'. people arent allowed congregate. Whats point masks? So... got new strategy avoid locking again? It‚Äôs even rant. It‚Äôs really, really sad point watch family friends continue deny like call the, ‚Äúeye test‚Äù or, ‚Äúplain sight‚Äù. 

These people love, can‚Äôt understand would act way, people looking love saying can‚Äôt see way? 

There‚Äôs problem America. it‚Äôs you. Wishing family best. 

My friend survived fight covid, friend (a triathlete) really struggling right now.. hospital struggling.. it‚Äôs joke. 

Be safe. Cheers. Meanwhile nearly 200,000 new cases one day good ole ‚ÄòMurica Agreed.WFH way advantages well.If told return office I'd looking another WFH position.
That said appreciate personalities. break summer got socialize go bars. going winter. knew coming. It‚Äôs one year spending Thanksgiving Christmas family. 

These people acting like entitled brats. Taiwan, South Korea, China, pretty much countries handled pandemic well *all* adopted American institutions response playbooks, making handful modest tweaks improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

The difference actually followed rather starting rather bad luck bureaucratic infighting, followed year political tantrums initial response never really suppressed virus later response never came. Or... could make adults get it. back curbside pickup groceries, hadn‚Äôt done since April. everyone else. would question someone taking advice stranger internet. We‚Äôre adults, know thing works now. Assess risk  Whelp. guess many people world anyway. Correction, thats 49,999,996 beacause family aint going anywhere. merely stating successful strategies common component crucial. can‚Äôt ask people wear masks whilst time keep bars open allow people congregate restaurants gyms schools etc. Similarly, can‚Äôt ignore developing COVID clusters mass test- result community spread (which happening Europe now) 

Each one measures listed earlier important, approach, measures governments select better deal pandemic. see coming from, amount resources poured astronomical

Two leading vaccines 90% effective.

These vaccines fine, need mass produced. whole world working towards goal, id wager even better place summer current predictions Surely WA closing borders splitting 7 regions controlled movement harder European country acting same?

I mean April legally driven car Perth wanted to... feel biggest thing countries really try, tbh. Really feels attempting eradicate keep simply never really considered option many. think Manzhouli closer land border. experience Xinjiang, one case place mean whole lot. ""Mental defense mechanism"" seems like fancy way saying stupidity Canceled fam get together. hurt feeling overall came conclusion. (We gonna blowout next year whole year plan (ifffff then))

Now allllll week read Rythm War baby!!! losing it? straight evil.

Fixed you. Americans learn like sloths fuck. also true live(Suburban Cleveland OH). HD lockers online order pickup(curbside takes north 20mins)- I‚Äôm in/out minutes it‚Äôs never busy weekday morning. lockdown 6 months live covid cases time.... still shop every 2 weeks, saves much time! Someone using brain waiting ‚Äúadvised‚Äù. Refreshing. Good work mate. obviously love family. Ps doubt, imagine America protest? They‚Äôre protesting voting did. make 1/5 population means need even greater compliance level adults though. enough people aren‚Äôt vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt work all. still large viral loads exposure cause people get ill. still get measles outbreaks clusters people low vaccine compliance rates. Remember people allergies autoimmune disease may can‚Äôt take vaccine. People still get measles example they‚Äôre exposed enough loads (and it‚Äôs highly contagious requires 90+ vaccination rate among group.) vulnerable 1/5 population unable vaccinate. problem adults working schools surrounded highly unvaccinated populations continuing spread, mutate, etc. Would really though? Lol  may normal healthy. healthy way respond ""oh, high risk activity optional, it."" one Presidential drugs make million per year of, something make real difference (ie make least several hundred million coming 12 months?) heard I‚Äôm skeptical, feel like it‚Äôs getting sleep 

I used take melatonin like candy back college perhaps I‚Äôll start both. Anecdotally reported, FB algorithms intended push certain psychological responses. IOW, FB playing emotions. Probably sites well.  dumb question. According research, people stop shedding live virus 10 days symptoms onset. may continue shed dead virus fragments, cause swab test positive, cannot infect others.

In rare cases, people shed live virus longer, one person immunocompromised shed live virus 70 days, known whether shedding high enough amounts infect another person. yes, likely vaccines end pandemic, sars-cov-2 virus manages mutate form antibodies made vaccines surviving covid, dont attach virus, back square 1. noticed, Denmark found new cluster-5 mutation minks, basically accidentaly noticed minks getting sick decided read genome virus, noticed major difference, isolated people came contact minks tested surrounding population. mutation considered extinct might be. Nevertheless known animal reservoars outher countries minks animals, jumping humans animals, bad many levels. dont sequence genome viruses enough, idea many signifucant mutations are. takes one show return back 2019. since majore scientists said probably human made virus contains parts HIV, malaria sars-cov-1, possibilities dangerous could endless. know HIV shuts immune system malaria deadly without treatment, imagine combination both, current virulence (spread rate) could deep sh*t. Unlikely, almost impossible, Lloyd said, chance... Canada #1 country world secured vaccine population ratio

Canada purchased enough vacs ~10x population

The next US Australia first world country 5x, You‚Äôre optimistic even enough testing supplies put numbers like that. I‚Äôm sure hear supply shortages way get numbers. mean, least reddit somewhat anonymous. Reddit 4chan complete garbage, use broadcast shitty lives people know, shitty opinions complete strangers. Stick point made, less people would died. doubt would shoot anywhere near 250,000 get message across.

How losing it? straight logic.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*270,000 Sums sentiments people‚Äôs behavior virus. I‚Äôm even judging anymore. government Dolly Parton already picked huge tab development vaccine US govt already paid first 100 million doses  lie? literally did. started lockdown days fucking chinese new year‚Äôs weekend.... keep telling blue yellow rocks weigh feathers. Reddit less emotional, words &amp; opinions, especially turn lots options use old reddit. Except mortality rate increase hospitals exceed capacities. Oh no. Hope Simpsons safe. Idiots like:

First time going rave pandemic!

First time sex pandemic!

First time refusing wear mask pandemic! Per capita....

South korea 10 deaths per million population. Mozambique 4. leaving ANYTHING personal responsibility Americans worked? Ever. I‚Äôve flown four times pandemic ever check box airport check terminals. needs unified mask campaign consolidated message catch phrase like Bit, reference WWII. would recognizable style, like Obama campaign posters. Uh yeah? It‚Äôs orange idiot office isn‚Äôt taking care it. Yeah raises risk dying, anything everything. Obesity normal matter much try convince others Shut want free money. Also final year. totally sure seems harder motivate work. mean get done, feels lot forced. TP let's pretend healthcare payment total debacle country able get flu shot last problems  know who's stupid, people without mask. think mask gonna help situation, property Moon sale. Prayers St. Jude!!! National Guard doctors already working normal doctor jobs. Calling takes away somewhere else. Good argument, I'm convinced too. dog BF good buddy. shut live far family. Skype stuff, whole experience made appreciate doggo more.‚ù§   Great Reset doubt that. people know spending big bucks non-essentials (fear of) job loss. need new fridge mine dying. Yeah that's chronic government mistrust Flu Measles natural immunity lasts people lifetime,

Might wanna edit 'flu' part..... think depends lot things. Yes traveling thanksgiving Christmas selfish good justification general. sister visit us daughter childrens mental health facility gor suicidal ideation sister even go see her. came family. coming us showering getting bed. needed support.

Travel still necessary unfortunately lot people. Going see loved ones important. because. paid $2 hour joke. get least minimum, would think would help rehabilitation process. Also going moon scientific objective. There‚Äôs greater purpose served getting plane pandemic, millions self-serving individuals making high-risk choice whole country. add more: 

The 19 covid19 year 2019 virus discovered. year. Ignoring fact ok old people dying preventable disease, people don‚Äôt die end sick long time ages. whole point quarantine stop hospital systems collapsing , lot places right now. ""good evidence"" degree undercount. Meanwhile California trying act like testing unreliable people using work gather. It‚Äôs backward messaging. point rich people going vaccinated us peons going go back work staff hotels, we‚Äôre going need rely testing it. sure. Social skills, think, particularly undervalued. many people working public be. Sometimes they're awkward shy, sometimes bitter rude, sometimes even though they're technically polite competent they're also standoffish rigid manage make whole experience awful anyway. 

I know employers attuned important someone front put people ease. brother secretly posted story Puerto Rico. Beyond disappointed, considering returns Monday Thanksgiving parents Thursday.  downvoted, right. advice celebrate Thanksgiving household. need skip Thanksgiving, celebrate live and/or inside ""bubble"". tell to? I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through. Thank sharing valuable perspective. saying west acted east acted, 97% half million people died, right?  good son daughter. dad lives fianc√© think pandemic hyped up. go restaurants, church gym. It‚Äôs frustrating, baffled even considered trip, cancelling day takeoff. 
I agree companionship important older folks, two other, even planning travel turkey day.., wanted get away. Ugh. work too. Goes ways tho. proper measures taken virus controlled strict lock downs necessary get groceries couple times that‚Äôs part it. well week ago maybe needed cautious. Paraphrasing here, Dr Fauci said tv 40-50% population get vaccine, won‚Äôt hit herd immunity pandemic won‚Äôt end. need many people get vaccine possible end thing. TIL... thanks  main reason why

Source: french guess never heard google see it‚Äôs happening everywhere? take follow real science read studies? 

It‚Äôs happening many months. Way go spreading uneducated misinformation. 

Do everyone favor go google... search: Covid reinfection

Learn. Educate friend. We‚Äôre fucked. Like, seriously seriously fucked. December January February going avalanche death. shown churches America.

and bars, restaurants, grocery stores, schools, workplaces... FDA approval expected around May

Not sure getting that, everything read said people start getting vaccinated mid-December. 

But agree, 50,000 optimistic - hoping latest wave state restrictions combined people staying home (as news fills stories overrun hospitals) flattens curve bit. kind groundbreaking inventions think we‚Äôre going see coming holiday travel pandemic? Yep, priorities are: i've never paid flu shot agree, let‚Äôs discount social pressures. everyone else around isn‚Äôt wearing masks, you‚Äôre going feel pressured wear mask well, even subconsciously. It‚Äôs difficult hurdle get over. reach critical mass people get societal pressure pushing way. interestingly enough mom director public health around told 700 health care workers mayo health system gotten covid, 90 percent got outside place work hospitals work at.  genuine bone body? capable spewing disingenuous fallacies?

Nothing posted anything acceptable level death, no, that's comes to. another straw man. even give credit mention something related acceptable deaths, oversimplification, terms logical fallacies, hasty generalization.

And throw question diverts us subject hand: mask mandates give citizens choice?

So no, follow red herring fallacy let distract topic.

I bet dipshit socrates routine gets lot high fives among people never debated life, gotta better gonna take shot me. Money part it, 1st finish probably goal. depends many hours person working. jobless get 60%. Kurzarbeit (still employed, working) get 60% work 0 hours unless employer bumps up. work 24 hours week get 85% pay. Theres bit formula it. people working get nothing extra. really depends data. currently know. suspect approved, can't approve assessed data. would really bad issue found people told rushed people. Yeah Thanksgiving dinners feature hundreds guests family members families engaging daily campaigning activities election/supreme court nomination...

What likely happened Hope Hicks (or someone) got sick test event, extremely unlikely event small gathering family socialize 24/7 mask-resisting conservatives.  idea military actually does, you? exposure apparently Hollywood movies. It‚Äôs nice meet fellow data enthusiast! Cheers! hope weren‚Äôt kind people weren‚Äôt cautious arguing masks stay home orders else deserved it.. hand, trying part solution wearing masks staying home hope survive get healthy again.. , mom wife uncles grandparents also it, always cautious it.. offense sound like keeper. something fiat currency make currency. yeah...we're 8 months shit basic principles play still enter people's minds.  Merry xmas, santa gonna deliver death car accident driving car near roadways ([FOR PART]I know people hit vehicles homes going die car accident someone one, sneezes me. 
The fact ‚Äúmore people die car accidents‚Äù argument holds weight shows people grasping straws justify irresponsible seat belts help prevent death car accidents, wearing ‚Äúthe government trying control you?‚Äù China locked Wuhan January 23rd, Chinese New Year January 25th. said still true ^^ üòÇüòÇ It‚Äôs joke.

Where get ‚Äòstory behind statistics‚Äô from? worth it, nose swabs pullin' brains nostrils! /s

I get complaints TBH. unpleasant sure, agonizing. I've felt worse pain splattering bacon grease. Boy, hear you, boy sympathize. close experience, mine plain old isolation new town social circle, social media, older mom antidepressants PPD. keep reaching anywhere can. Sorry lack Thanksgiving. alone. Might want go read comments back truly believe troll Everyone world decided since they're stuck home, they'll go home improvement spree exact time led situation now. Notice big spike summer 2 weeks 4th July.

Expect 300k cases/day 3000deaths/day mid January need legit lockdown. think vaccine affect case #s death rate another two months (people get first dose mid-December, second dose mid-January) 

I think curve also - hopefully - going flattened number states re-imposing restrictions. Sadly, what's happening Texas, El Paso they're calling National Guard help morgue duties, meanwhile AG suing city trying impose mild restrictions shutdowns. think area brain must broken. always like err cautious side. Plus, people getting sick around work still covering pie holes cough, hard pessimistic. Agreed, demographic statistics too, like number people vaccinated 70-79, 80-89, 90-99, immunocompromised, healthcare worker, etc. 

So much fun watch infections tracker! getting tested! get tested good go! /s  Ah, that's question answer for.

The [tl;dr conditions increased  kidney disease  (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)  conditions, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies  state (weakened immune system) solid organ transplant  (body mass index \[BMI\] 30 kg/m2 higher &lt; 40 kg/m2)  Obesity (BMI ‚â• 40 kg/m2)   cell disease   2 diabetes mellitus

And really want go details, reports studies fed lists found yes, despite nitpicking, obesity list known risks. there's ""relation"" obesity comorbidities. small important distinction.  grandfather died past spring found old ration stamps WWII going things. laughed thought Americans today sacrifice anything like that.

The irony many called 'patriotic' people see praising veterans, military, worshipping flag, etc people rail lockdowns, masks restrictions. talk highly sacrifice can't bare fucking minimum protect fellow countrymen. think people would‚Äôve patience real lockdown consistent nationally actual plan place. paid stay home, $1200 France like US even entitled, trust me. Also we're notoriously skeptical anything government hope child's trial goes well treatment successful him/her.  That's they're referring to. know lot people feel different that's true number. example know drug overdose deaths gone year. let's say get everyone vaccinated next year drug overdose deaths go back 5 year average. increase 2020 attributed covid19. October (your article). what‚Äôs happening now. I‚Äôd settle 14 days. kinda like abolishing speed limits expecting people figure safe speed. Roads would turned racing ground less 24 hours lot people already covid, many travel mild asymptomatic case, course still traveling, many relatives Florida traveling since July. scared...? get scared around 2-3 people next me. need relax. ""we"" ""mitigation efforts"" sounds like kind cultish ideology rather rational decision making based science.

Look disagree article engage science rather controlling censorship information fit beliefs. go back year one would care this. mask hysteria. people appalled people wearing masks. chose go there, let enjoy it. risk. And? Shit happens. feel sorry local movie theaters (not chains) going business BAIL home theater setups cheap + streaming services? feel bad guy owned franchised blockbuster video store? retroactively bail out? problem is, moment goes works Biden, half country start believing even less. think 3rd world countries get help first vaccines ready roll out... starting US. remember vaccine spit roast you. facts hurt ur feelings? Boohoohoo go eat poopoo ur mk yellow toilet. Yeah, terrifies us. half country wondering lies ahead us. US thr western country though many European countries governments can, given constraints imposed law. take issue statement Eastern countries much better European countries, given issues outlined previous post. Shelbyville fancy masks social distancing fine  Christmas holidays followed NYE parties back back ultimate double whammy. see NYC going back dark ages. Dr.Redford said wouldn‚Äôt surprise made million cases day. used think estimate. think might underestimation keeps going way it‚Äôs going. expect? Hilary Clinton still much problem many Americans. Imagine bunch missing emails bigger deal quarter million dead? North Dakota, 1 every 1000 died. kill zombifying public Always Sunny Philadelphia. dunno Puerto Rico deal Oregon... Oregon recently counting first test someone took positivity ignores subsequent tests. think done randomized sampling (I think) epidemiology. think better growth/spread models problems pandemic drags on. skews positivity rates high though subsequent negative tests ""dropped"". think dropped original intent subsequent tests first test random picking truly random sample.. quote that.

Now (IMHO) idea behind ignoring tests first test track spread disease outbreak small city processing plant. useful LONG pandemic disease outbreak.. point processing change one other... Oregon is/or soon change reporting include negative tests too.

People argued change long time ago comparing state state longer makes sense since many states changed this. think recall Florida first include negative tests back pile.

A certain amount surmised can't find text involve 12 hr read dense epi papers. highest incarceration rate planet? Cos living free? family literally doing. 12 days self isolation, PCR test private clinic. shopping. Delivery groceries wipe down. Outside, masks times. 

And no, Thanksgiving masked dinner. numbers fine. Mind one us ER doctor leave needed break working shit storm March/April/May NYC. 

Of course family made idiots can't trusted rigidly follow protocol, recommend this.  Lol, assuming that:

1. actually Manhattan/NYC becoming unaffordable tons people forcing exodus lower-income New Yorkers coupled *Roe v. Wade* cratered number unplanned, unwanted lower-income people born fact vehicles longer gave lead fumes urbanites grew spent lives inhaling due gas becoming unleaded late 20th century ""cleaned up"" NYC 1990s-2010s instead NYPD's punishing (lower-income) people broken windows that
2. police generally give single shit proper mask-wearing themselves. One political party consistently said scientists, nurses, doctors, virologists, etc, wrong.

It politicized back February. Oh. 200k wind bad, healthcare system somehow still managing cope, though staff resources beginning spread thin. tornado hits many cases hospitals handle, resulting turn away patients leave die without adequate care, people illnesses also start dying much higher rates enough beds/ventilators/staff treat them. That's healthcare system breaks down, that's everyone afraid since began. already happened NY time rest country relatively unaffected able help sending equipment staff. happens whole country overwhelmed one afford send help supplies? I'm denier, but... evidence death rate greater 1%?  Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years coming federal leadership. We're doomed. Buying way problem rather actually addressing it.

See ‚ÄúWhile cannot predict long FDA‚Äôs review take, FDA review request expeditiously possible, still thorough science-based manner, help make available vaccine American people deserve soon possible,"" FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn said Friday.‚Äù

This reads start reviewing Dec 10th?

(p.s. great username!) Many years, least CA OR. Kroger (Ralph‚Äôs) Target it, I‚Äôm sure others too. ice cream??? never happened you, doesn‚Äôt exist? ever cancer? No? Hoax! Ever limb amputated? People one leg myth! ridiculous. Lots things happen people know. Doesn‚Äôt make real dangerous. Imagine asymptomatic passed someone killed them. would directly responsible someone‚Äôs death. Someone‚Äôs mother, father, brother, ect.

I never said wasn‚Äôt real. said danger isn‚Äôt enough justify deathly afraid. people age/health bracket aren‚Äôt dying this. 

Even people aren‚Äôt age bracket don‚Äôt die it. vast majority people catch experience mild symptoms.

At point, catch it, catch ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm going let stop seeing family. want stay home, good you. take precautions hope best. Telling people can't something makes want anything, apparently American culture made adults toddler brain Obviously Thanksgiving plans outside household insane many places screaming holidays like can't dine indoors much country? 

It really feels like they're everything support people pandemic JFC Almost one skipped fourth Halloween, that's spikes have. 

Even did... what? mean religious holidays (the people actually religious holidays around Halloween call Halloween) mean acting like ""omg get blow stuff drinking put costumes random day actual significance can't individual celebration house ONE TIME.

And now, darn horrible told put family dinner (aka another reason get drunk) people die.

1428 Americans died *yesterday* Covid. Almost 256K died. mean, getting together eat important? Obviously people families household eating together, bringing outsiders together. Why? reason? can't stay masked. stay distanced. dangerous. December 11th could realistically doctors getting jab. Unreal. I‚Äôm happy Also easily assume actual numbers currently around 3-4 times disclosed.. people know it. everyone getting tested. Cases soaring live, Walgreens companies offering tests fully booked accepting appointments beyond two days out. I‚Äôm scientist. cocktails contain neutralizing antibodies TNF-alpha IFN-gamma. two things cytokines body releases you‚Äôre ill nearly viral infection. they‚Äôre produced excess covid infection, people end cytokine storm. gotten bad recently parties throwing/people over, wanna go near lady next door. call ""Typhoid Mary"". (Real name fuck Mary) this? masks let let in? even read title article? explain economic freedom low? Regarding comment ""some countries relate"", many countries high median salary? many countries people buy lot useless shit amazon twice week? 

I'm sorry think strictly american problem, absolutely not. Perhaps americans' money management issue. 

If talking public holidays little time travel, would agree there. One side thinks virus hoax take precautions, I'd say chart looks pretty accurate tbh. guys think another national shutdown coming US? Washing state shut restaurants bars dine in.  people act voluntarily new cases found given area strictly follow rules again. Shanghai there's 3 new cases last couple weeks number people wearing masks streets indoors shot considerably since then, despite government mandating it.  Trump's trade war help either lol. standing front monument million dead end Exactly. eating inside restaurants. suddenly EVERYONE clamoring eat inside like life depends united states country run lawyers, lobbying groups, special interests. 

Technocrats say general trend humans optimistic/positive cognitive biases warranted, probably serves useful adaptation anti-maskers think may right. 'Cause Americans got turkey! Even could spread fortunes every person equal among people we'd still completely miserable I'm saying way safe correctly Stop blaming America Chinese fault need go war china fucking idiot. enraged someone else wearing mask outside middle nowhere take his, also spits them.

I wonder realises hypocrite is? Ramping testing gonna make cases ""go up"" though, even they're actually increasing. taller curve June testing, cases. Deaths counted accurately, makes sense look those. deaths start go down, something done right. likely government pay, obviously depending whether government pay. Oh horrible. yet post details investigation.  
I think Australia's war crimes Afghanistan Canadian ones Somalia went UN ""Peace"" keeping mission. hope so. 

hey, gotten bad enough family members FINALLY starting catch on. step sister go birthday dinner mom canceled thanksgiving friends usually invites. 

I'm trying find way telling rest family i'm staying home weekend nicest, convincing way. wisdom look beyond narrow Western idea money point life

No man, he's got wrong. Chinese (and much SE Asia) cares money whole lot, governments people smart enough realize better take economic hit now, drastic lockdown, people get back normal (i.e. work) ASAP. Respect vulnerability? like sake greater good, certain people going suffer society accepts that. Wuhan - extreme quarantine measure; medical staff country dispatched help. Vietnam - communes 10,000 people quarantined handful cases. Singapore - migrant workers quarantined dormitories 5+ months. stage none get go top spreaders form medical staff front-line workers people require daily nurse care like nursing homes since cannot possible avoid it.

You target people vulnerable INFECTION, vulnerable die. viruses main strength infectious is, lethal is. 

**I think save people lowering RO fast possible, lowering lethality select few.** keep asking many comments sections, fine ok , grandparent donating cause(pulls pen paper)? mention healthcare workers overworked dying overloaded hospitals. snowballs. I‚Äôm thrilled appears (although there‚Äôs data yet) vaccine way effective anyone predicted. doesn‚Äôt change fact going magical diary dust instantly cover planet: mitigations still going necessary next year so. 


It‚Äôs fun people act like children. repeatedly said thread hoped wrong. yay got wanted. Now, go back sixth grade learn interact gown up‚Äôs. mean didn‚Äôt make policy. supplies limited trying make sure hospitals staffed. test positive we‚Äôre two weeks. Losing nurses techs mess staffing entire hospital especially we‚Äôre pushing capacity again. Everything connected. wisdom endured life for, several decades, become apparent.  atrocities ""super powers"" era including Britain US.

Right now. Literally last months reports forced sterilization detained immigrants. even get started attacking Iran's nuclear facilities. China's government definitely technocratic. Leaders rarely lawyers like west, rather engineers people scientific technical fields (the last three presidents China, Xi Jinping, Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin degrees engineering). podcast? could put link? dissonance lot deniers. wrestling incompatible beliefs believe half first place. Uhm yeah fuck mentality. I've locked house past 8 months, can't people same? excuse maturity issues I'd say. existential dilemma giving rise deep fear, must quelled.

What think capitalism, open-free markets commerce for? :-) work consume toys distract us horror knowledge approaching deaths. still means want stop top spreaders, target least healthy people, least healthy people still likely contract virus next months... UNLESS high risk infection lethality.

An old person chronic illness nursing home high risk INFECTION living conditions need nurses daily. 

An old person chronic illness living home seeing medical staff regularly high risk infection old chronically ill, high risk lethality. 

There way way way chronically ill people medical staff, definitely medical staff first essential jobs likely spread it.

Just look professions get vaccinate them, pretty easy. hit virus strongest, infection rate vs rather low lethality. read war crime report coming Australia shocked. always thought Australia chilled out, away wars. somebody comments said thing Canadian forces war crimes Afghanistan.

What fuck wrong world?  honestly, eradicate via scientific epidemiology (isolation). 

vax may benefit managed appropriately however, current vax obsession inappropriate. 

for kids community health, stop vax belief system propaganda learn epidemiology now.

here's example (share scientific planning tool authorities now); Within 17 days we're going start hitting 3,000 deaths per day. NV, I‚Äôve noticed work (I work mall) groceries stores it‚Äôs 95% wearing mask. 95%, 70% wear correctly. told authorities medical companies? surely datapoint make reevaluate priorities trials vaccination order... IMHO second transmission in-household really blows things up. One member gets party / halloween / Thanksgiving 2 weeks later every person live with, like spouse kids gets guaranteed transmission. That's nearly double overnight, one hand in-home spread naturally confined almost guaranteed. Christmas going depressing year. 
Not able meet.
Because Thanksgiving surge cases going dying. Weird, would Saturday. 

middle class dont't savings? middle class 100k ish, save 20K get tears me. I‚Äôm sure hospitals losing revenue US mandated sick leave vaccine would cost ~$1000 per person make [healthcare revenue  Even healthy young people died. state everyone would‚Äôve fined business shut down/lose operating license. Everyone needs take seriously. Even elderly neighbours family popping round least week. I‚Äôm hassled visit family like everyone stopped caring we‚Äôre still seeing hundreds deaths daily.

I wanted Xmas family rate looks like it‚Äôll partner together year one else. hope family survive given blas√© everyone I‚Äôm pretty much writing 2021 well. TP?

Whats TP? Im American 90s you. Look comments one example type American aggression I'm talking smh

Insult millions people suggesting empathy love see others suffer, complain shit ridiculous claim. Typical. pretty sure get shot Nice response!/s   No... we'll see deaths dec 31 2021 probably day far, 6 weeks post Thanksgiving peak-fatility range infection surge.

Imagine going sleep one night world normal waking next find 3500 people America died yesterday weird new virus going around Wuhan yesterday. It‚Äôs time cut Florida mainland. Literally. Get saw let float Atlantic. I‚Äôm starting feel like we‚Äôre getting weeds here, I‚Äôll give another shot. 

The upper middle class segment economy options. lot stuff produced lower middle classes, can‚Äôt choose redirect vacation slush fund grocery delivery: living paycheck paycheck. I‚Äôm saying case, current reality average American absolutely many options shelter.

And said ‚Äúdoes feel safe.‚Äù I‚Äôm going argue shouldn‚Äôt feel safe, I‚Äôm arguing incentives reality, today. said said true, would already paid sick leave, would paid sick leave that‚Äôs feel safe. upper middle class clearly problem flu cold season point demonstrated behavior 2020. I‚Äôd expect go since many cops working overtime Sadly version investing. Yeah one friends moved Illinois years back comes California every couple months. He's generally smart, strongly progressive, yet unknown reason still coming back amidst roaring pandemic, state travel advisory week Christmas.

Not thrilled seeing vector man year. Talk us doubting Refer comment. Basically, nearly enough vaccinations vaccinate even half population 2021. virus stopped way. IDC anyone calls I'll sitting mask waving, watching die good luck them. wish best. hope sometype travel health insurance month US ICU top Million bucks Sounds like NZ frozen food worker mysteriously got infected somehow months ago. say [this article say found traces I'm sure think anymore. Boy can't wait around co-workers keep masks pulled sneezing coughing everywhere saying ""it's allergies"". carry travelling, going bars get-togethers, going beauty salons, etc. Fuck this. Ah yes.
The crisis people paying attention knew would come.
When covid swamps hospitals, every patient suffers.   many infections per day we're bound get mutation soon invalidate vaccines currently produced. enter 12 Monkeys Songbird territory. Everything regarding production vaccines gone fantastic far I'm preeeetty sure would go jail brought people house stabbed took blood.

I'm lawyer, think might right there. :P

I look medical scribe was, yeah, would nice home sure.

Best luck coming months stay safe there. :) weird short lockdowns beginning year, nothing even though apparently much worse wiki states aimed protein spoke virus. two antibodies used overlapping binding affect receptor, interfering virus penetrating cells. Thank insightful comment. past seven days, Florida number 37 cases per capita 38 deaths per capita. make exception comments special. okay, chill. We've decided coronavirus there's nothing worry anymore. ^/s Also sometimes get good swab people jerk grab person testing them. refuse let correctly. Like... bruh. think so, children tweens able get vaccinated till like past summer. Truly it‚Äôs made us great.  53 year-old Gen X'er three kids college (senior, junior freshman), heart goes students. Sure, there's plenty examples spoiled party brats (we've always them), vast majority college students struggling navigate really difficult situation. stakes high, options limited. many threats health (physical mental), financial well future prospects. That's lot deal young age. 

Past generations defined wide-scale trauma, Lost Generation Greatest Generation. Based I've seen, lot confidence Gen-Z rise current mess, anything us older generations could help would mean lot. think put argument 'reference marks' people stop misunderstanding you. That's never going happen. never done significant measures stop spread flu also killing people yearly basis.

You never gave fuck. certain pre-covid never shed tear someone dying flu.

Why implement new set standards now? drawn line arbitrarily. first dose absolutely offer protection. Picture helping clean top front one using high pressure ""bidet""... Vaccinations really start happening 2021, able cover small percentage population. primarily people health sector ones risk group.

It'll take quite vaccines save us. ifr estimates 0.9 1% far tell. cfr 2.3%, would suggest missing slightly half cases according logic suggested, 6 7 like claim. someone family 70‚Äôs lives region, Floridians could make proud. hm that's strange, thought italy france spain Whats even worse terrible crisis hit us like freight train going people going ""who could known would like this? can't believe see coming!"" Yeah, I'd say good. course mask regulations still apply congrats immunity. Go see friends family I'm Jewish cremate corpses. uh obvious reasons post WWII. embalmed proper PPE. course can. freedoms enshrined constitution takes two votes general assembly general election inbetween pass new laws. Ok anti vaxxer bought feel dirty admit give shit anyone else move on. multitude cultural reasons. He's also unlikely CEO much longer since Sanford merging Intercontinental Healthcare. tail end business career CEO retirement tour become Healthcare lobbyist. I‚Äôm guilty too. Gave quarantining summer Limited work availability.

I feel like future fucked internships year. Quality post!!!  responding comments say care about?  I‚Äôve going gym too... Except fact that, like case, victim fell ladder underlying condition (COVID/getting shot)

Cause death guy OP's case would ""trauma fall brought hypoxia, caused infection Covid-19"" Yeah okay dude, seen coming.

No.  Sounds oddly like ""the market regulate itself"" frustrating people use response everything. can't nice things. Like said, personal responsibility account people selfish. Yes, course already there. talking hundreds millions doses want distribute US, military equipped that. Yes, planes, no, uninterrupted -70C cooling massive scale. Millennials little older think. average age Millennial 30 now, upper end 39. 

But Gen Z's still young reaching 25. 

Not blame things generations entirely anyway, definitely seems like mix two. 2 3 million week first week January without tons lockdowns.

This wave probably peak middle Feb.  evidence using mouthwash prevents infections. mom‚Äôs health crap. There‚Äôs chance last Thanksgiving. willing drive state pick older sister, decided safest way get visit (mom lives me, isolating much possible)

We decided risk high. going video chat Thanksgiving, hope mom‚Äôs health gets better

If stay home, everyone else minimize exposure change clothes get home. best do. leave shoes door, walk house them. too, taking second step inside, leave mat. wear 4 layer mask polypropylene/cotton combo that's fully form-fit, air gaps around sides chin. I'll either wash spray outside lysol let sit kill funk regularly, switch masks. also went mall weekend person shopping üòÅü•≥ likelihood yes. theory could reason would recommend generally would serious concern. What? mean government pass laws infringe freedom order protect public safety?

The point still stands. Okay explain it‚Äôs misleading. I‚Äôm really close chat group 8 people. intelligent thoughtful. beginning this, us wanted talk COVID split side conversation clear others didn‚Äôt want talk it. (That‚Äôs changed now, course.) 50/2 = 25. end it? sound neat. Kids virtual never leave house. Mask wearing really good Austin. go see friend hospice, also strong mask protocols. place around people masks airport plane incubation periods align. scientific assessment fairly probable source don‚Äôt levers force unless lay people take it.

Feds force military federal workers take it....states similar route. could require air travel around time frame. least 70 million morons won‚Äôt taking vaccine. exclude another 70 million kids - half country continually infect other, along 5-10 percent vaccine doesn‚Äôt work. life. owe anything. 

edit: thought might still living parents... godspeed!  Thanks reading. Ah sorry went there. big toll ol' mental health. :( lockdowns part business now. certainly case - priced - people decided invest establishments. Unfortunately also careful people don‚Äôt ability completely isolate. MiL taking reasonable precautions also required go work, everyone wears mask (although always does). feel bad everyone like sees risk wants reduce much possible unable full liking. Perhaps, current position face masks work.

You know, maybe recent evidence suggest do?  visiting Tennessee commented many overweight people doctors warned health hazards. told health practice go doctors cause might give bad news. Guess figured they'd rather end emergency room find stage 4 cancer massive stroke, lieu dealing earlier. Luckily, Tiberius designed HAHAHA you‚Äôre r/coronavirus majority people want continue forever never lives begin want everyone else miserable.

As teenager unless compromised immune system serious medical issues you‚Äôre basically good go , leave house without really worrying dying .  Omg people living live social media fear mongering. Definitely possible. Gotta remember large portion country doesn‚Äôt really need vaccinated due immunity pre-exposure Realistically point we‚Äôre going hit worst case scenario end winter. Basically everybody America catching several million dying. I've already done that. Bye! absolutely catch dead, one religious figure found hard way (he died). Greetings future. hit 200k. üé∂The get together, to-gether, to-gether, to-gether, get together, infected be-come üé∂

EDIT: üé∂and friends covid, friends covid üé∂ (chorus) cannot fucking believe this. 9/11 tragedy we've got 2000 cases day, KNOW OF. Imagine 9/11 every single day President fucking goes ""it is"" keeps golfing. that's President.

The people god damn better. ""Never forget,"" right? sure hell seem quick forget 2000 people dying DAILY today. Imagine put mask miss Thanksgiving one year prevent 9/11 every day even fucking that. Pathetic. 

I understand 9/11 terrorist attack men, women, children died Americans none less truly gave shit 9/11 deaths, give shit too. idiots flight risks knowingly spreading virus care say hoax might well terrorists themselves. They're fucking walking, talking, bioweapons. Without reading article guess: person question complication Covid, stroke coughing spell, disabled leading fall.

Reading article seems like fell injuries really minor, traumatic enough cause death. died lungs fucked COVID. Fair enough, still wouldn‚Äôt call one ‚Äúworst capitalists‚Äù. close cardio rooms, gyms. Fuck this, I‚Äôm home work trying get pandemic fucking Florida man running around getting piss drunk lines restroom. I‚Äôm sick responsible listening experts shit. Amen! think slavery using lot government resources paying that. paid law abiding citizens only. really hospital beds

i discovers using language makes people believe problem solved simply buying beds. high price pay save lives? cut off? many lives/families/business ok put ruin save many lives? powers (trump) understand afford continued lockdown. govt. can‚Äôt pay everybody shut stay home. happens nobody money live? find safer way keep businesses open. Lol! Love it. need summon great cornholio TP distribution. area mask compliant, get TP. not, well TP YOU. bureaucracy making sure safe efficient. know safe months trials. That's insane. selfish man‚Äôs virus. I‚Äôm leftist know plenty liberals going secret bars restaurants. People done. Sad. Go Florida! think saw Australia locked hard 100 days less 100 cases entire country. lockdown 300,000 dead end year. mention people long term potentially irreversible effects COVID-19. Sure, lockdowns scam. /s That's true, alone bring us back normal within 2021. UK late.

Feb peak ski season - lots travel Italy, France Austria.
You would need closed borders early January latest - time woudl chance getting approved! Bro, chill. People process cope different ways. don‚Äôt know persons experience is. 

Also, you‚Äôre looking place politically correct sensitive, Reddit comment section may you. keeping Americans best interest point. 

The virus keep mutating, keep better job us keeping citizens alive. 

They open travelers countries respect human life carry fine without letting us American dipshits across border. many births every 17 seconds  bars allowing many people/not shut right away city? article ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs thing COVID South Florida,‚Äù said another."" 


Oh damn realize that, good? Tulsa, Oklahoma, mega-church sparked outrage social media announced would hold indoor ""Friendsgiving"" event Sunday, encouraged participants bring friend neighbor.

What heck wrong people? totally understand position. need treatment something exist quite logical solution. I've looked clinical trials disorder (narcolepsy). 

To vaccine though, rather try treat something already have... That's got scary thought. 

I hope child's trial goes well, even better comes market viable solution US run economists 90% Trump would happened.

His Fed guy, JPOW shut Trump constantly. models predicted millions dead done nothing. predicted hundred thousand dead minimal mitigation. Fauci 100% correct. see people dropping dead hospitals, many capacity nurse pleading people like give damn.

But don‚Äôt care. don‚Äôt care life, yourself, miserable way live. possible run mill coronavirus similar cold around awhile really noticed low spread? mutation happened make far contagious? Found coworker tested + stared feeling crappy days later came back +. Tbh, feels like mild cold. can‚Äôt smell anything though completely lost appetite unusual me. :D Re-read original comment. actual data back guessing? I'm little bit rock n roll ehhh Maybe they'll change minds seeing after-effects American Thanksgiving. widespread becomes, harder gets avoid though. substantial portion population currently contagious, superspreaders, eventually even taking care general errands/responsibilities masked becomes riskier (unless using N95 quality similar). certainly right chunk population hardest infect, still weak points. 

I incredibly careful, always masked, social distancing, etc..., still infected back May exposed large outbreak health services location attend monthly order keep prescription meds. Eventually one weak points breached. 

The spreads, weakpoints exposed. also think point amount people still isolating hardcore back March/April probably large percent population. Work responsibities makes impossible large chunk, another large portion care. think enough available population virus mow majority given time. end winter believe realistically possible large percent population infected virus less potential hosts, thus dropping R0 point virus turns endemic. shall see, worry vaccines still important returning normalcy, lot opportunity avoid damage missed. Florida, new cases virus week 49% compared week ago, 8,410 new cases reported Saturday.

Arbitrary measurements fun different states different parts exponential curve.  part process rushed bureaucracy, science. 1 million cases day time joe president fault Also Sarah Palin dressed purple bear singing ""I like Big Butts"" Masked Singer, minutes Trump announced Europe travel ban. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ knew it!!!  happens believe grifters con artists scientists. That‚Äôs Fauci experts saying. Also initial round vaccinations healthcare workers risk populations bring death rate significantly. Life‚Äôs going back normal soon (it already somewhat restrictions looking placed anytime soon). Yep. thought surrounded decent people cared others. friends favor women's rights, mental health care, LGBT, BLM, etc came staying home, keeping distance, masking up...nope, suddenly care themselves. Health safety others damned. analogy older people get younger ppl. Jimmy Carter last technocrat, maybe could argue Obama too. initial wave vaccine entirely consumed government at-risk medical people. think enough fully cover medical people. risk older people get next wave. Wonder military slotted in. Sorry, PDF, recent bulletin published Oct peer reviewed accepted.

Silicon Valley, Aerospace, pharmaceuticals, biotech, energy, etc.

Yet engineers scientists real positions power. scares crap family live 2 small islands there, one doesn‚Äôt even hospital. They'll survive. people pass (and people people pass to) lucky. individual survival rates, community transmission 

How many people die people stop trying downplay this? ‚ÄúFree‚Äù lol way make sure maskless assholes last line vaccine? home test. Yeah comfortable I'd rather myself. know it‚Äôs Reddit comment, real people suffering dying healthcare collapse pandemic. Save jokes another time. yearly vaccine flu, it‚Äôs much less deadly, doesn‚Äôt spread exponential rate Covid-19. Covid-19 killed people less year flu kills many years.

We get it, don‚Äôt care spreading misinformation lies. Stupid people tend kids much younger even 21+21+21 = 63. 25+25+25 = 75 plausible. also suggested 10 pm curfew currently place could amended 11 pm allow customers finish meals drinks pubs restaurants.


They could also allowed take meals drinks go. Shut restaurant dining 6pm. complaining wanting private insurance? asking investment healthcare services. Private insurance would mean doctors focused less people. Looks like Trump right Regardless makeup, let's remember actions speak majority generation. hope Thanksgiving dinner plans entire extended family. 


A scary related thought: areas well controlling spread, deplorables along well meaning simpletons inviting relatives Thanksgiving... ""cOmE HoUsE yEaR, CaSeS sTaTe LoW!!"" 

Nothing safe next week.  I've cautious this. Probably due work experience. Early engineering career, construction site. worker took hard hat eat lunch. Someone high structure accidentally dropped large bolt...killed guy eating lunch. Seen lot freak accidents someone let guard minutes sh!t happens. Everyone thought happen them. fool.  Maybe healthy young people another issue rare genetic disorder?  don‚Äôt think saw one article saying normal thanksgiving Weird confused dumbfounded Europe's massive death count surging cases though. odd jobs. paid 2 bucks hour less fight forest fires.  They‚Äôll fine masks on. /s boss telling us every Monday weeks soon fairly rapid testing available we‚Äôll need back office. 0 reason us need office, don‚Äôt like us knowing that. imagine ‚Äúeveryone must return office x date,‚Äù mandate addition ‚Äúyou must vaccinated return office‚Äù mandate. could get tired seeing Americans suffer rest world? point made great. pay taxes? consider decent chunk people COVID even symptoms thus get tested, actual mortality rates even lower. reason Wow...so petty.  BBQ toilet killer. I'll let guinea pigs get vaccine first. rushed way quickly. I'll take right now. I'll continue properly wear n95 masks surgical mask really wanted reply ""Dune?!

13th Amendment: 1. Neither slavery involuntary servitude, **except punishment crime** whereof party shall duly convicted, shall exist within United States, place subject jurisdiction. That‚Äôs awful. Also, wish could read Greek Yep! scenario Republicans used President Obama took office Great Recession. second Obama became president, dumping unemployment numbers lap let 8 years. going use tactic, use Covid-19 numbers completely ignore context behind cases.

By 2024, conservatives saying Biden started Covid-19. keep wondering consequences hit. time now?? Don‚Äôt   Covid!

Open   Inside! bet Michigan Illinois, big box enforcement mask mandates clustered around places universities educated populations. That‚Äôs aids started. ban church goers hosptitals.... see jesus One housemates thinks bullshit personally know anyone who's sick. Tell competitors working home saving thousands concept would considered outlandish. really subreddit called r/misopedy Oh know agree follow proper procedure. would nice federal government run intelligent people would working roll-out past months, possibly getting rid hurdles speeding approval process. knew working vaccines. Get paperwork done advance. Another disgusting Trumpist lie. 250,000 dead far. Hey genius, math vast majority Americans **already got Covid**. They're selfish taking precautions believing reality. I'm selfish avoiding getting sick spreading others nothing else, least parts america showing countries do. need theorize worst case scenarios observe live experiment progress, well get valid data results.  matches heard TV, travel 40% day last year.

The biggest difference 1919 mobility breadth exposure. I've known happening reading 650 frozen bodies people killed virus 10 miles away quite chilling. thinking could prevented others taken virus seriously, especially charge, gets blood boiling evens out, guess. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs yesterday, indoor dining shut Denver 19 counties went red: www.denverpost.com/2020/11/20/restaurant-shutdown-november-denver-coronavirus/amp/

Edit: Jesus, it‚Äôs Sunday. Friday, 20th $3 Oxford Maybe Trump focus building wall FL rest us. little bit like Noah. think people banking shot. talking kool aid drinkers man. even bother, keep keeping on. People don‚Äôt wear masks, don‚Äôt listen scientists, expect allow needle inserted holy veins? funny many ppl mention tp. That's shopping list afternoon. don‚Äôt insurance usually get free county state health department. Guess close US border. weren‚Äôt danger others, honestly point would say F let natural selection take course. space tables 10 feet apart! everyone attendance rapid antigen test. Rapid tests really catch who've infected past 3 4 days better nothing. importantly chatting dinner make sure everyone masked going talking 6 feet apart. Oh, anyone 70 go all. get covid going tough fight life-changing consequences. Even survive may use walker even move assisted living rest lives. Well fair violent diarrhea one symptoms Covid haha. deluded. Look I'm excited vaccine. family that's getting early next month. general public wont even see needle April minimum Following patterns Spanish Flu deadlier second wave. BeSt HeAlThCaRe wOrLd Zoom thoughtfully lifted length limits Thanksgiving, guys rush dinner dessert 40 minutes! No. Stop trolling. often wonder though call bias really presented facts go someone believes based prior assumptions facts contradict.  guess women becoming violent Agree 100%! need keep bars open reduced capacity enforce masks. well awhile gave up. agree you. main point even infecting million people day, that‚Äôs still nearly year needed infect everyone won‚Äôt able keep pace reckless people get used up. way hitting herd immunity vaccine reading someone condescending asshole they're different experience lot nurses. 

Hey OP, newsflash: experience speak everyone country country *huge* different areas experiencing different things. know plenty nurses one. make special again, allow speak us. mean China formally acknowledges wrong lied tried blame pandemic US military? past week Australia outbreak 17 cases SA immediately shut entire state, complete lockdown. Seventeen! What‚Äôs happening US utterly insane. 

As doctor, can‚Äôt describe fear felt start pandemic, realising odds stacked coming unscathed, newborn baby home. 
Luckily, thanks cooperation general public proper leadership essentially COVID free nation. imagine American counterparts feeling every day wake go work, president doesn‚Äôt even care. Terrifying. Big IF. point isn‚Äôt working people going books parties. can‚Äôt relate job. people place go people see could masked supervised instead drunk private residence. one rebellious types partied unmasked work, they‚Äôd caught immediately got tested Monday Wednesday. Whatever imperfect situation forced navigate next six months, widespread testing makes safer. Lockdowns work time six months twenty percent population flouting unenforceable guidelines enough doom mitigation efforts. enough one vaccine shot? Yeah. Like, ""Sorry, grandma. can't join Thanksgiving felt like getting lit young healthy friends past two months.""

Except I'll put money people even that. people feel good going they're 80 health complications people give 0 fucks transmitting vulnerable people lives, would put grandparents sequester society rather wear fucking mask. No, everything said makes sense. data proves Italy september, lot dont know still virus. could U.S. way think did. Literally plot Shaun Dead.  It‚Äôs emotions, seems smarter it‚Äôs words rather pictures. ""Masks also, probably primarily, protect people."" 

Awkward AF sentence aside, that's completely wrong. Many known long time masks protect wearer too. really. It‚Äôs locking students online classes. somebody hasn‚Äôt set foot campus semester long forced campus take COVID test make university‚Äôs numbers appear better actually are? focus testing actually use campus leave folks alone self isolating home. shouldn‚Äôt punishing taking precautions locking online classes (which still pay full tuition rates for, btw, despite getting full value true college education return).

Seriously tho website Apparently, yeah.


Play stupid games, win stupid prizes...  fair ask whole found usually give you. Compared ignorance, it‚Äôs not. comment violation rule 1 sub. want argue comment, rational way. informative! thanks! think healthcare workers go strike til National mask mandate significant penalties. 

The burnout real sick assholes. Congress can. can't. part Commerce Clause Article I. Yes could got virus Italy brought back china then. Rich Americans get first. plebs point future. trucks exist capability needed. division former company designing capability needed trucks/trailers. Proud accomplished. give Americans credit, they've finally learned get hysteria get back normal life. back government desperate use COVID power grab can't let happen... Yet 99%+ people survive. Assuming gathering = death sentences isn‚Äôt accurate. would like leave would nice like  numbers trusted now?   it‚Äôs dangerous.. Ooof. impression Greece handling least first wave well, surprising read title. Come , really blame everyone still wanting live lives virus know vast majority us fatal . 

Do really expect youth America stop living lives 80+ people could years ? 

That‚Äôs huge ask . I'm sorry, notice username different original guy. defending murderer. Makes much better. Brave souls provide long-term vaccine data us mortals. midtown commute showing around visitors, usually. Certainly NYE. expect city prevent happening, rather people deciding responsible. Enough minks holy balls didnt know soo many mink farms. Even Gucci use real fur anymore Canada goose uses fox. buying mink fur!? Cant USA dont think bidet course bleach white people assholes. Check racism. Sorry I'm buying BS bothsiderism post. Covids origins, epidemiology, masks, lockdowns, etc politicized Trump enablers almost day one. Nothing left would changed that. Pointing obvious reality criticizing people willfully endangering lives way worst possible response. think UK doses coming EU production line  No, no, no. Tenth Amendment prevents Fed government police powers whatsoever. States plenary powers aspect. Thanks.

So looks like less people flying year either due covid, economical reason Yes. Plenty people want right thing, also plenty idiots equate mask wearing tyranny. It‚Äôs lot greater 10% parts country. followers equate mask mandates government oppression. 

This one Donald Trumps greatest mistakes (and crimes people). politicized mask wearing convincing simpleton followers Covid isn‚Äôt real, masks part liberal plot infringe freedoms. Anyone knows anything science know asinine; however unfortunately shortage uneducated science deniers following him. Imagine Walking Dead survivors option stop zombies eating faces attempt talking rationally them. 2nd last sentence. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs thing COVID South Florida,‚Äù said another (twenty-something). upvoted? Eugenics good thing pandemic seems One primary issues vaccinating health care workers first places already starting see staffing shortages. staff shortages less patients take care of, mortality starts go up. Even milder case, usually work 10-14 days quarantining. Good thing main problems going come January. would gladly skip ONE holiday chance 20-30 more.

We've told skip every holiday since March. heck people getting skip one holiday from? lot people would willing skip actually one holiday. said it'd turn around around May guess I'm psychic too. Lol. Unfortunately next bit gonna absolutely suck. flew Texas couple weeks ago visit parents sister. made sure everything needed two weeks advance, sat home two weeks, took Covid test three days flight tested negative. 

I would fine airlines requiring negative covid test flying. know people still catch actual test flight, would still help prevent people flying. Thanks. Yea. think it‚Äôs fear unknown long term wise. handle fever painful arm actual shot. read somewhere also

Like making smart choice? ! life risk guess. France COVID update: Daily hospital admissions fall 1,000, lowest since mid-October

- Positivity rate: 14% (-0.8)
- hospital: 31,522 (+157)
- ICU: 4,491 (-2)
- New deaths: 215 It‚Äôs really fucking stupid, but, reminder, choice dichotomous. Doesn‚Äôt mess total lockdown. scientists feburary said wearing mask sick people, flu...yah called bullshit that. I've wearing n95 mask since beginning feburary, restaurant bar since new years eve. Aside work still personal lock mind.


There's lot assumptions post, unbecoming. thought HHS Azar said, correct! Maybe Florida that's they're doing? read somewhere, info overload... also know better. get don‚Äôt care human death suffering, think it‚Äôs exhausting care it, that‚Äôs lazy spoiled become. would right to. risk lives bunch spoiled , entitled, assholes don‚Äôt give fuck irresponsible actions going harm others? Oh good point. assumed lottery meant one pick numbers.

But right. set ones, yes, might increase significantally.

But..... dunno. guess imo, win coz actually lose money Lol. buy ticket every months realize applies infectious diseases, one. feel like averring sentiment prior year? allowed visit?

I nursing student fan following reasons:

1. Even new grads get least months orientation, more. Nursing school necessarily teach nursing skills critical thinking acute care setting, especially use virtual simulations exclusively.

2. worked CNA getting used routine took little bit time. Even given NA responsibilities, students would still need time adjust.

3. responsible? doubt hospitals would want hire students staff. something happen students patients (highly likely), held liable?

4. student gets sick otherwise incapacitated, happens schooling?

5. saying would opportunity learn use resume. fjne people like want go acute care setting. However, students want go clinic work, research, informatics, etc. risk/reward worth them?

I would love hear thoughts well. Whoa...guilt trip...my last one? cool u mind saying so. sad Don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôre round corner man /s  pandemic it‚Äôs not. they‚Äôre rightly suffering consequences. could take time type that, hit save, think relevant accurate? anecdotal conversation reflective anything, much less Look comments one example type American aggression I'm talking smh

There's death, there's long term side effects. There‚Äôs really reason anxious vaccine itself. It‚Äôs two-dose vaccine, doses weeks apart, you‚Äôre fully covered probably week second dose, hit point fine. FDA expected approve Pfizer (and possibly Moderna) vaccines December 10th, 20 million doses ready go. Even Dr. Fauci said vaccines could start rolling general population March, return normalcy April. seem overly doomery looking actual statements experts.

Also, vaccinate health care workers elderly first, vulnerable population protected death rates drop off. 

We eradicate Covid anytime soon, protect vulnerable get back sense normal well 2022.

What percent cases believe, now, detected?

If 1 10 cases detected, means 120 million Americans it, 1 3. seems high. percent cases detected? 1 5? 1 2?

And tell us true mortality rate? (I‚Äôm assuming deaths counted). Luckily cut drinking way staying home going out. Gave chance realize living healthily. 

That said smoking/eating lot weed though.  fearless... That's I'll NEVER go back Florida. damn crazy. Can't second wave first wave never ended. pinch 20 grit sandpaper gets poo too. ridges remove more! Yep bad cases skyrocketing nonstop, means least two weeks getting WORSE. Good luck America, gonna need it. study fucking laughable.

Wastewater analysis Italian sewage show showed Mid-December.

There's lack excess mortality Italy Sept-Dec, study left wildly overreaching suggest circulating less virulent variant.

The IgM results simply unbelievable 10% population positive, indicates fantastically poor antibody test. IgG tests around 1-2% consistent antibody cross reactivity false positives (same problem initial rounds antibody testing early pandemic). test pre-pandemic samples e.g. 2017 show detect 0%.

What remains 6 samples tested positive neutralization CPE microneutralization assay. 6% antibody positive samples positive neutralization simply screaming antibody test total bullshit, yet report waste lot effort talking temporal geographic distribution clearly bullshit IgM results. rest study believe 6 positives neutralization, I'd like see another hundred samples 2017 run positives, results validated lab.

And wastewater sensitive around 3 known infections per 100,000 roughly 30 per 100,000 0.03% population infected.  highly sensitive. 6 959 0.62% 20x sensitivity wastewater detection (and IgM/IgG numbers ""lol no""). Oh. Compare Florida did. never scoff premise arrogant idiots ignoring scientists movie. know insane? They'll reap they've sown. outnumbered even in-state. look florida's voting records. rest nation much different. Truly depressing year shredding last hopes humanity. Ah see. wrong it‚Äôs me. always got worse. worst ever now. worst ever last week last week. People like worked home avoided humans 9 months waiting get better willingly sacrificed human interactions anything help. I‚Äôm fucking villain want see family 2020.

Still use brain next months- people that, faster get behind us read linked? nowhere say study Italy wrong. say sparked debate among scientists show tracing origin virus incomplete work verified. really choice.

What ""It"" refer to? way get people travel airlines shut airports. We‚Äôre stupid selfish society right thing it‚Äôs right thing. great equalizer it‚Äôs laborers getting infected think vaccine created rushed half year well tested crazy. Even experts say unprecedented. process usually takes decade. Let people beta test mass I'll hop see happens. [And shut down. There's rumor floating around he'll announce something Monday. I've heard one business organizations companies already preparing ""essential worker"" passes employees again. 

We honestly never gone past phase 2, understand pressure under. Might time Phase 2 again, even limited Phase 1 X amount weeks. That‚Äôs good news Americans  And...

If think Covid needs measured you‚Äôre perfect example are. someone punches wall angry need anger management courses. maybe situation. Whether need punishments entirely different thing.

However, refusing acknowledge larger points. lied initial comment about, failed answer question asked clarify mean.

You interested honest discussion. interested manipulating conversation something allows feel right matter what.

Punching wall domestic violence. increased calls matter diminished.

I respond behaviors listed. CVS Walgreens places general public get them. defrosted stored regular fridges little bit (Pfizer 5 days Moderna 30 days). university went upped rent student apartments year 150 bucks. criminal. Creating environment fear abuse totally agree you, narcissistic done control others works really well unfortunately. soon enough, mean protection vaccine 2022 earliest. that's many antivaxxers? (Who according get endanger themselves, also everyone else medical issues therefore must depends herd immunity.)

We know protect people that. get drive whatever speed want highway. get climb mountains without properly prepared. plenty examples already things allow people do, even though ""personal risk"", cost high society, either terms breadth impact resources used mitigate effects.

You care 'rona? Fine, people care. get reckless expense. really luck weaning self down. Try one less cigar rete per day every 2 weeks smoking couple evening quit.

But yes crazy USA lately thats great news. means 48/49 coloradans arent contagious covid-19 test without autopsy know know not, leaving America hard entering America. Also, job demands here. happened twice already.

Wouldnt surprised wuhan strain first.

For coronavirus, one seems mutate lot veing led believe. Bad year mink. They're thing.

The fact unable realize reinforces fact part problem even smart enough realize it.

Good luck, sounds like really gonna need it.

Oh, even waste time replying.

I read it.

üëç many companies trying make vaccines, one trust? Somebody downvoted this, think you‚Äôre absolutely right quite insightful.

That‚Äôs say left isn‚Äôt also fault conformist. It‚Äôs specific case conformity expressed following guidance experts rather supporting president. question resolve argument friend. So, group friends hardcore social isolating wearing masks go out. example, girlfriend literally go grocery store, gas station, mom's house laundry (since alternative laundromat, worse--we wear masks around her). That's literally it. I'm exaggerating.

My friends hung together since March. Today, talking one friend great we're vaccinated hang (at other's houses only); however, said comfortable even then. 

Since we'd still practicing precautions outside hanging out, said would practically impossible one us get corona pass others. disagrees this, can't explain could happen. cited health official said life ""get back normal"" May, unable explain relevant pressed issue. mention none us high risk group.

My questions are: 

1. friend overly paranoid evidence one vaccinated person could pass coronavirus another vaccinated person way illness could result?

2. credible health officials scientists suggesting safe group vaccinated friends meet small home setting, taking account precautions we're taking lives?

I'd like able say friend point, see there's real risk involved. I'm afraid purely mental health related. Plenty people care stopping it, specified cost. told stop virus seeing family going fun, remember wear annoying uncomfortable face mask every single time step public, interested.

That post makes argument vaccinating children sooner consensus (which either later possibly all). sure mean b ""throw caution wind"" here? cautious action vaccinate children prematurely.

I understand think assignments might easier us. honestly, agree result better learning. But, low stakes assignment would much better taking one course. none us do, everyone multiple courses. So, end submission day average. assignments require much effort watching lecture, agree putting effort worth learning perspective, stressed whole day worth 1-5 grade points hundred, feel bit cheated. People skip it, assignments usually become driving force course students, missing assignment equivalent week backlog course, means next assignment less knowledge, pressure previous assignment. 

Assignment driving force learning sad state affairs, completely agree it, us. try stay ahead assignment timeline, tried whole semester, keep many assignment, general lack enthusiasm due mundane lifestyle. 

Honestly, love professors like you. open suggestions, stubborn. know teach, easily assume students' learning well matters you, things personally expect professor. 

Sorry poorly formatted post, I'm mobile end semester exam 8 hours now, I've sleep night time India right now. 

Take said individual's opinion though, possible friends form echo chamber. However, may suggest conversation students first class spring semester. Students hesitate speak class, happens online sem, may use following points tod drive conversation, make people participate. 

A) Asking general opinion autumn semester. 

B) experience assignments workload courses, maybe additional workload due online sem (this applicable students country, usually help parents household chores)

C) Ask opinion low stake assignment vs high stake exams.

There nuance involved:

- better workers deliveries _everyone_ going out. smaller pool.
- said, buy one-off orders. want pay $20 $10 restaurant food that's worth $5. cook home get groceries every 10 days.
- government paying people stay home beginning. knew gonna happen - unstoppable force ""We can't give people money nothing!"" meets immovable object ""Since I'm paid, can't possibly stay home distance""
- still need lock much possible. Since job cushy, anything groceries prescriptions since March. defy everyone economic class same. can't right thing we're power, would anyone?

Hearing fatigue annoying exactly problem arguing veganism.

Yeah, think everyone _try_ vegan. neighbor eats steak, mean owe chicken nugget. Yeah, vegetarian better nothing, that's long-term goal, want anyone _start_ drinking milk eating cheese.

We pushing every front once, arguing whether 31.5% fatigued 31.4% fatigued boring waste airtime RSI. _Please_ stay home much can. bars open, go them.

We common sense. Anecdotes data shut up. doesn‚Äôt explain going bars though it? don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs public/private divide schools remain closed/open anymore. Possibly month fall was, public schools in-person classes private schools fully virtual, depending schools are.

Not they're selfish dickheads. need pay, I'm physician runs rural health clinic chief staff hospital treating COVID patients.  I‚Äôve family come times past months (it‚Äôs monthly now). last time wore masks social distancing really. Everyone crowded around room inside.

It really pissed gotten shut express traveling okay right (especially another state). think fine it‚Äôs *family*. 

A times past would come, take masks eat (I would never eat them, eaten anyone table since pandemic) gathered around table like nothing. Mind you, many relatives high risk group.

It's possible empathy still firm. This. check influenza numbers column want understand including doesn‚Äôt help point.  shows sneaky virus is.

He's one seems able express really thinks going on, since advises governors mayors represent them.

The Osterholm Update great Podcast. Every week get truth sees it. poor? compliance.. brains, dont we? people saw decided use it, opposed westerners wailing putting masks murdering freedom. China 3 4 recent presidents engineers. Like, real engineers. NHS kidding rollout 1 December onward. Props UK least taking good start vaccination campaign.  something bad doesn‚Äôt mean better things can‚Äôt also bad that's massive keggars for.... /s know originally wanted title book, ""War, Good for?"" Depends age.

Still way 50% chance, even worst case probability won't. way know actions directly killed someone (hypothetically), would care? old news tho? kind thinking would be? I'm failing see utility reverse. There‚Äôs telling people. whole thing unreal. reaction governments flu hyper inflated. 
This covid even proven yet bad flu.
The testing completely flawed. 
The masks myth.
Social distancing myth it‚Äôs aerosol stays air passes someone (just like normal flu)
Nobody dies normal flu anymore, die covid, even though normal flu used kill old vulnerable people like covid. 
It‚Äôs ploy get people get vaccinated like herd uneducated baboons. 
If people feel like risk get vaccine, otherwise shut let lives go back normal. 

This politics playing medicine. complete opportunity big government even control usher vaccine elite badly want us have. 

Rant over. Time wake up.   People able take personal responsibility seriously countries. However, US incredibly individualistic culture reflected lack support social programmes behaviour this.

Source: American watching overseas place Covid since May. Weird. idea ideas come from. brain going smooth comes statements like that? get covid die alone, drowning lung fluids FOMO far individualism. wish would China barricade people house outside armed guard get need.

Yeah I'd rather ever government that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking China worse‚Äù sounds hella american bruh keep USA USA literally hired Uber driver fix data us like two weeks ago R.i.p.

Word enforcement would travel far, fast wide! Oh bother wish people reddit would realize critical public health policies disregarding economic &amp; emotional impact year also abiding interest keeping physically healthy. know slippery slope, I'd think would common sense. One thing I've learned though never underestimate human stupidity. see many stories ""I think big deal"" people regretting holding gatherings homes one would hope things would sunk now. 

But digress, many people given done trying help educate others hope get publicly available vaccine soon go bars hang people again. I'm honestly surprised lasted long. Probably biggest exercise self control remember. you‚Äôve lived Fort Lauderdale, Florida United States week, could surprise you?

South Florida full BRIM assholes. TBF true COVID, sea level rise all. telling you, former classmates even cousins definitely hats. 

Terrible protocols. frustrating.  actually valid point. lot misinformation flouting around causing people skeptical. recently read article said 58% Americans willing get vaccine. is. Posting curious like yourself, spread misinformation. manager this, ""I want walk around mask day."" Gambler's fallacy thinking winning number x last time, chances x again. (Thinking past results influence future outcomes) Well, need start without bantering back forth elected officials contradictory messages. can't president conflict governors conflict local officials conflict police departments.

Multiple governors overruled local mayors local lockdowns mask mandates. Texas governor issued lock order overruling local mayors locking down. Georgia, governor removed local mask orders. Florida, governor issued executive order banning fines wearing mask many local mayors put place individual complying mask ordinances.

What happened El Paso insane. Governor says lock down, County Judge says lock down, City Police Department says enforcing lock down, State Attorney General says county judge indeed authority issue local lockdown legitimate, County Sheriff department says City Police department enforce lock down, sheriff department will.

Unfortunately, need fix blindly throwing money situation   I‚Äôm dreaming. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs way would happen. It‚Äôs gonna happen people charge don‚Äôt it. data is..

It's sort like there's medical cure broken leg. still help get body situated heal best possible, often much better could hobbled back home. Well, bride's parent's apparently Covid deniers, possible insisted going wear stupid mask daughters wedding. think used like mom...

I really love best friend, like said, he's usually lot better this, I'm trying let my... conscience... get way... year April thought. people SK Japan fucking idea exp is: yeah that's 'belief' irrelevant such. fyi, 'exponentially' expression often used everyday life SK maybe actually better idea.Its problem trying defend countries failed response virus, commenter mentioned, inherent racist idea happens (barbaric) China cant happen advanced west kind mindeset, definitely witnessed early days pandemic. wonder since west indeed center colonization, invasions wars, subsequentlt economic technological advance, hey history dymamic things, maybe okay bit open-minded explanations. sucks 3rd world country one cares you. one way use nuclear accelerator attention. Oz federal level decided inact 'national cabinet' - mainly spread blame considered going disliked measures. national cabinet turned round started telling federal level going be, generally taking charge federal level evidently clue.

Even majority right wing nuts, embarrassed action policies switched state leaders. instance, clueless federal types trying keep state borders open. However, one state particular (one secessionist tendencies, ring bells?) decided say 'screw that' hard shut borders. states pushed similar public demanded similar strong action. state could hammer eradicate virus inside borders, open till bordering states done same. 

Perfect not, stupidity still abounds, possible navigate working policies - provided sane voice demanding sane policies loud enough - least one positive example available. Interesting include flu pneumonia deaths. 

Florida basically open months, yet still better country. counter fear mongering post. point starting wonder America wants recover. I'm usually serious person please love god, cdc health professionals recommend. social distancing, washing hands, going large group event meetings, covering face face mask, everything else. together please take care others ability help &lt;3

And honestly tempting probably better avoid family gatherings things considered, practice social distancing (especially family members know they've been) increasing risk catching covid. someone lives ""at risk"" individual take extra caution make sure these, really simple. please take care around you, sick stay home rest.

Take care! lot people protect themselves


Too many people elderly risk wear masks public, traveling state, plan spend holidays family take unnecessary risks. people took seriously, things would lot less bad.

Nurses show hospital hazmats break rooms shown perpetuate spread, covid positive nurses work extremely risky. staff volunteers hospitals fall vulnerable categories putting unnecessary risk general public refuse fucking wear masks GOP refuse meaningful governance. shaved 8 months, beard getting long. find bad itchiness even mask.

They care survival, somewhat tied revenue. Many (not all) churches barely making ends meet COVID. understand want meet, got find ways modify liturgy make less likely transmission vector.

How churches handle 1918 ? Also one talking much Pfizer covid vaccine gonna hurt. Penicillin shots kept refrigerated hurt like motherfuck due temperature.

Just think shot -70 degree going hurt.  Ok. They're still worse Mozambique. countries like South Korea. Maybe learn east african culture politicians. Yup Actually, much US, masks likely would take. never supposed prevent second wave.

Have told people this? Theres lot people, thread, seem think rise cases Sweden due wearing masks. wife gave birth August - haven‚Äôt done anything since March. It‚Äôs tough it! Strange many people seem upvote long term immunity articles much evidence short term immunity.

I think people mistaking overly hopeful interpretation immunity vs resistance. 

Detection antibodies alone prove sterilizing immunity. Detection cells immune cells tells us even less level immune response actually get thus bet immunity even less theories.

In case immunity really matter vaccine coming talking long term immunity DEFINATELY cause less people get vaccinated. read see happening right comments articles suggesting long term immunity right reddit. soon give people reason consider alternative narratives good chunk people jump ship new narrative different unique minds. avoiding conformity sometimes make stupid decisions. see time people trying *act cool.* 

Like VAST MAJORITY data says short term immunity. suspect average immunity range 6-12 months based majority data I'm hopefully say 12 months. 

When read 7 MONTHS IMMUNITY, that's scientific way talk immunity. Immunity average. 

In case least they've shorten time realistic window probable immunity. **MOST people immune 3 months high probability statement that's think immunity, probability varies significantly person person.** least case coronaviruses. 

With Flu Measles natural immunity lasts people lifetime, completely different viruses. yeah get immune whatever flu strain get life usually, flu mutates like virus producing new strains constantly. That's sticks around. Coronavirus sticks around producing long term immunity reliability, otherwise would eradicate itself. COVID could different, data suggest is.

So I'm glad see honest interpretation facts once. went conservative estimate, responsible way present immunity data. want people thinking immune aren't.

It bring question long vaccine immunity really last expect eradicate virus. 150+ high school students 100% mask compliance class every day. remind noses...mostly due loose masks. HS kids, notorious flaunting rules, right thing, adults better. Risk vs reward. reward shown Moderna study 99.96% vaccinated patients didn‚Äôt contract COVID 99.4% patients received placebo didn‚Äôt contract COVID. That‚Äôs half percentage difference margin error probably least 1%. reward great unknown risks? Fucking hell. rule law. sounds like problems third world country would experience. catching it, dying yea Same. sheepishly told friend mine shopping February. didn‚Äôt think crazy. Said could roll hurricane supplies didn‚Äôt need it. college days, would pop bunch Xans Forget go take test known raise risk complications COVID-19, new study finds higher weight seem raise risk catching virus first place. Figuring things take time. Even child knows that. Agree. Though incredible revenue. inoculate 3 billion people, that‚Äôs like 100 billion revenue. something special dates people. Take circumstance (not we're gathering, damn hurt to) example. mother died beginning year. father going alone Thanksgiving, lost wife, time year loved.

The risk high take chances, lot misinformation, quarantine fatigue, along plain old reckless behavior there. turkey me, talking politics in-laws? could best Thanksgiving ever. I've read people taking elderberry gummies. Anyone know shoot terms MG's zinc. I've taking 5000 iu vitamin month daily along vitamin C 1000 MG.

One thing dad said really stuck Sweden proper national crisis 200 years. war since Napoleon. Europe parents grandparents could tell WW2 etc.. like collective memory work bad things really get.

Workers handle packaging port get exposed way. 

China 4 clusters since June originated workers handling imported frozen food packaging. know hate Chinese government. hate.it competant government isn't. opposite? always expect worse, I'm never disappointed / let down. I'm pessimistic people around actually get annoyed it... can't help it. feel emotionally safer always anticipate bad things happen.  Absolutely. We're already hearing places healthcare staff tested positive covid asked come work. mention mental emotional toll take. going pretty. morbid sounds..

Seriously, expect China find what's wrong instantly? country that? * Sealing side exits reduce entry/exit points health checks welding people shut, would preferred Australia solution send armed troops guard exists instead?
* Asian success owes anything fact detected virus spread, whereas Europe US let fester since least September 2019 test anyone death blew March. well developed detection key success.
* COVID spread provinces China, China able deal early detection.
* Almost every single COVID treatment used date discovered China slowly tricked west, COVID PCRs invented China, genome first sequenced China, majority medical equipment used western hospitals made China. west dosn't even compare China term technology
* Oh Chinese vaccines emergency use since September million vaccinated already, hundreds thousands doses arrived Brazil, Middle Eastern countries already getting jabs. fact hear like Pfizer applying emergency use says west's propaganda network medical expertise. Personally, blame FB, concept show everyone much better/wilder/more-entitled are. Yep. baby May.

But weren‚Äôt really put son danger. We‚Äôre really poor. see page, testing ramped June, making seem like cases increased, even though not. intensive care admissions, decreased steadily quite summer holiday, although *even more* June-July. Intensive care admissions represent perfectly, better case numbers, since testing even. could differing demographics, clearly see steady decline, matters. Also, R number 0.85 April 25. needs organs anyway? poor people afford save $100 shitty chinese tv one fucking day? huge loans signs shouldn‚Äôt going college large numbers, system parents general designed push academically statistically promising route. Truth ramps need exist vocational exists schooling, allowing people pick critical skills like ‚Äúshutting fuck working‚Äù. Victoria shut down, basically winter large portion spring, basically 100% mask compliance obedience strict lock rules.

Good luck getting US state implement extreme measures, good luck getting US populace adhere rules anyway.

Australia didn‚Äôt dodge bullet, got hard fucking work collective spirit, something that‚Äôs never going happen US current ideological/cultural/political war bullshit. 

It wasn‚Äôt magically strain made worse US, it‚Äôs Government giving enough fucks protect people, large swath population who‚Äôd rather people die inconvenienced.

Funnily enough, there's one country world that's close stereotype, would China. yanks gone soft That's appropriate attitude face of, say, terrorists whose goal make afraid. Carrying case sends message terrorists they've failed.

Welcome Reddit. know what, thinking now, part problem, saying social distancing wearing masks hard, go f--- yourself. We've lockdown almost 9 months countries lot better are. know why?

Belgium loosened mask mandate mid-September, Czechia reopened schools September 1st. Masks definitely work, Sweden's failure acknowledge mandate borderline criminal.

Pretty much every European country continued allow schools open. US outlier going extremely damaging tens millions children rely public schools. Public education one great equalizing institutions society closing year going horrific consequences. subreddit views public health exclusively mean many COVID cases country has.

Masks probably dampening effect circumstances overemphasizing saying baseless things like effective vaccine delusional obviously lead risk compensation. amount people think reason COVID spreading US people wearing masks crazy. Belgium ""loosening"" mask rules removing blanket mandate outside, mask mandates walking street nowhere near anybody security theater. Nobody knows much mRNA vaccines point, that's problem. real problem though distribution staggered supply limited, SOooo people delay millions get ANYWAY.

The people want first wave guinea pigs fine going get first wave vaccines anyway, stragglers. Come now. There‚Äôs 4 states 10K per day. We‚Äôre fine.... 2/3 weeks ago heard German radio 1LIVE Germany beds lack 4000+ medical personnel.

This Dr appealing people take seriously else cannot manage. I'm seriously considering telling making story

In case, lying ethical thing do. Yeah, we‚Äôre trying survive day-by-day. I‚Äôm nurse, immediate family nurses well. We‚Äôre terrified reckless, ignorant, selfish people here. 

Where world, friend? Hope things okay country exponential first wave ignore virus spread exponentially nature. That's virus does. Unless kills like 70% infected really contagious.

You make sound like revelation behaves like scientist said so. Scientists world saying exactly since beginning. India absolutely massive population, I‚Äôm sure comparing raw numbers case particularly informative, better go per capital. Ask shall study starts page 2. Page 1 clarification. recent study came showing SARS - different virus, probably closest thing we've got - seems left survivors level protection even 17 years road. Now, ""some level protection"" necessarily mean immunity, may mean body start bumping antibodies quickly may barely get symptoms probably done (possibly including contagious) 3-4 days. may experience minor could essentially mistake immunity.

Now, that's guarantee, similar virus, encouraging. One thing definitely know - reinfection scale less year *exceedingly* rare. documented happen, last heard reinfected number 30 58 million confirmed primary cases, so... roughly 1 2 million? Maybe more? Maybe less?

It's open question, Magic 8 Ball says things looking good immunity. co-worker said me""Nobodies stopping seeing family.."" ohhh ok IFR relatively low (around 2%), infection rate high. makes deadly. Well be. Things definitely normal Fall ~~2020~~, ~~2021~~, 2022. Czech Republic Greece? What? might want recheck sources. horrible Indeed :) 95% effective rate would extremely unlikely vaccinated. 

They don‚Äôt know 100% yet whether people get vaccine still get infected pass virus others asymptomatic - phase 3 trials didn‚Äôt test everyone continuously don‚Äôt know sure people still got virus asymptomatic and/or could still spread virus (people trials asked get tested symptoms). vaccine successful stopping severe cases sure quite possibly stops infection together, can‚Äôt say sure. know time goes on. 

In saying that, looks like won‚Äôt around April later get vaccinated unless healthcare worker. 

Healthcare workers + elderly first group get vaccinated (hopefully mid late December EUA) likely reduce age group (eg 60‚Äôs) next lot vaccinations. continuously review results apply get vaccine licenced that‚Äôs becomes available general population. hoping Q2 maybe Q3 2021 (source: Scott Gottlieb, board member Pfizer former FDA Commissioner).

Full immunity kicks around 2 weeks second jab 4-6 weeks initial jab. socialize education health care. 

Education already socialized K-12 may states heavily funding Pre-K programs. Healthcare could socialized serious cost reductions system first.

I think universities socialized really public goods. exclusionary - median American let alone poor often lacking requisite skills/certifications accepted succeed many them. contrast K-12 accessible nearly right cannot turn away anyone even severe mental away war machine scrutinize government spending.

Restoring military budget pre-Trump levels would free around $70B budget, would certainly help really enough pay many proposed social programs here. Also, keep mind deficit normal year around works many countries definitely work us.

These systems ""work"" countries necessarily make desirable. 

In terms healthcare, real argument nations outperform us big time regard. one strong point American healthcare drug/treatment development specialist availability that's really it.

In terms education, may ""work"" countries think Americans really understand consequences universities countries set universities cheap.

 American tertiary education even big secondary school achievement gap still among inclusive universal world, around 56% US adults attempted college education time. nations, especially European nations, around 10-30% adults given time *right* study university given time earning right often requires secondary students put schools tested middle schools gain entrance to.

European taxation also lot regressive US means marginalized immigrants, poor, blue collar labor force, people real shot goint university etc... paying pretty hefty taxes mostly upper middle class students Europe study without paying Obviously insurance companies fill political wallet, big say

Post ACA average profit margin healthcare insurance company around 4%. Plenty insurers left market afford cost accept sicklier uninsured people. don‚Äôt think anyone gather inside really besides bathroom. agree though Lmao I‚Äôm lucky enough live within drivable distance I‚Äôll road tripping home feel bad friends live across country vilified get home.

I‚Äôd wager 50-100 would die, everyone else stuck rooms. ...except example actually makes sense, due sensory overload, removing-mask thing multiple levels willful stupidity. cousin Alexa mean assume that's sarcasm, really hope that's sarcasm... fairness, college students mental health decline years. remember time started breaking class wave distributed mass hysteria word considered ""trigger"" (but relevant subject class) mentioned. many wholesome awards given next months.   everything right.... Except gathering one roof confined space. could go wrong?

The issue people like treating reward system. right things, cheat treat nice thing gold star. Guess what, virus care. completely alone thanksgiving definitely understand sentiment. really bothers could go get drunk bar friends I‚Äôm told see parents family holiday. Yeeeep. spent far long arguing antimasker said mask mandates overreach ""if wearing masks good idea, people would own."" hope too. depressing spend holidays alone. Lots people (nurses, firemen, EMT) spend work. make sacrifice keep society running. years. ONE time. big deal. healthy people survive, even safest age range, plenty people extremely fit died, many lifestyle changed permanently least temporarily due huge loss stamina, understand fear may get, it‚Äôs simply better safe sorry, vaccine, safe  deniers keep argument. Positive cases matter! Deaths inflated! tiring Maybe actually respected it, second. ‚ÄúI DECLARE HERD IMMUNITY‚Äù 
‚ÄúMichael cant declare herd immunity‚Äù probably surrounding counties then. AFAIK vaccine deployed end year, beginning 2021 latest. need stop immediately. rob potential hosts well enough curb spread sustainable level pretty much end pandemic. 

If know protect that, problem something bad happens you. wont harm anyone else deliberately. wont fuck sake either. Neutral approach. Obesity [known raise complications COVID-19, a¬†[new higher weight seem raise risk catching virus first place. 

How thought obese made easier catch virus first says reassuring study also found evidence differing immune responses virus, assuaging concerns ‚Äî least extent ‚Äî prevalence obesity could hinder impact coming vaccines.  study find weight-related difference COVID-19 symptoms among employees caught virus: weight meant higher likelihood fever multiple symptoms.

These two statements contradict other. First said differing response, says likelihood fever multiple symptoms (which immune responses unless meant antibody production first statement), truth?

This really poorly written article, can't even finish rest without rolling eyes. LETS F\*\*\*\*\*G GOOOOO I‚Äôm TX (Austin), see same. people give 1 F*** anyone themselves. hEB changed policy, well stopped enforcing it, needing masks bc they‚Äôre worried crazies take crap innocent workers. It‚Äôs sad pathetic. guess always assumed price turkey like price ham never really thought Herd immunity always topic pandemic. It‚Äôs literally reason vaccinate. 

But sure believe you, you‚Äôve read facebook chats surely must case! That‚Äôs better primary source all... Thumbnail kinda r/mildlyinfuriating hitting center various mutual funds pick medical oriented. might better trying pick stocks individual companies. Every single one place fined $1000 owners 10,000 - make examples damnit! risk dieing Covid greater odds seeing Cowboys win season. look like stupid assholes me.  Key points: Alexa didn‚Äôt attend party, drove mother, got sick......wait, what? Thanksgiving Christmas.

Sounds like plan church vibe. stocked groceries next weeks. fully expect number people treat normal Black Friday.  right, put wrong number. posting realized 98.25%. even go belief 96.25% so, that's literally less 4%. underlying conditions. average, healthy person survive this. 

I used afraid covid spending entire time pandemic working going class without contracting virus. Get vaccine feel it'll help you, I'm people choice. let fear virus alter live. Oh goodness he‚Äôs actually serious. heck going Sweden? thought individual speaking joking first worries... fault know reddit works lol I‚Äôll tell thing tell 5 years old: Don‚Äôt believe everything see YouTube. ex-foster mom, probably whole family, covid. 

I think ok pretty healthy lowish blood pressure, wife high blood pressure, 2 kids overweight healthy genetic reasons. 

2 kids special needs, go person school, went church even though told to, moms cops. 

With infection rate town 1 20, probably chance avoiding it. 

I ordered little covid care kit told start taking vitamin D, zinc, melatonin. Hopefully she'll listen me.  that, many leaders many areas denouncing covid-19 science around it, complete failure leadership, way president. Actively mocking people mask wearing met reckless endangerment responsibility safety citizens. health care workers frontline workers, don‚Äôt think many people getting covid genuinely reasonably avoid it.

This privileged point view. plenty people cannot WFH forced exposed. Even wear mask social distance, protect 'freedumb' types refuse wear mask. I'm spending Thanksgiving alone. sucks. I'm going make crawfish etouffee buy Patty LeBell sweet potato pie. never said that, explained reality live. parents live state. One alcoholic loser abusive cunt. bad me, bad people relatives suck. It‚Äôs impossible *not* find time year. agree points. still comparable take account population. Australia 75% size US (in terms landmass), however less 1/10th population. alone means people likely spread other. Oh shit I‚Äôm sorry know answer no. However, possible state ban incoming flights bullshit asshole states? Like, flying Logan Boston? Noooooooope! Go back Florida, Florida Man. least movies it‚Äôs usually goofball theory alien invasion beyond category weather event. case it‚Äôs ‚Äúwear mask‚Äù people flipping shit like offered shotgun enema. precaution. COVID mutated quite readily mink live appallingly crowded conditions.

The next mutation could even worse. COVID mutating slowly humans, lucky. Who? showed virus far widespread FHM claiming - remember months FHM claiming number cases plateaued. started testing people, obvious hadn't.  no, mistake point far infections Sweden previously reported.

You realize start test public, find many cases? proof hospitalizations deaths peaking, spread lower compared mid June? anything, thought even widespread actually was. even attack countries saying Swedish strategy best?  Tegnell promoting stupid strategy around world, nation stupid enough try quickly changed mind.

Same here, wrong comment? ""arguing would ‚Äúreally detrimental trust‚Äù ‚Äúdisastrous many ways‚Äù.""

WHO exact thing, avoid lockdowns, saying it? attacking countries? 

I seen mention countries listened followed advice, countries talking about? speaking able trust comes leadership‚Äôs mouth. I‚Äôm saying deceitful china even censorship truth. That‚Äôs really disputable lolwfymarofl IFR .5 absolute worst. That's whole planet.

Do read history? People slaughtering millions centuries.

And makes think care?

You're first world consumer. lifestyle requires death suffering millions. mention ecological devastation.

But care?

You're going live like Amish person others suffer. worry. things go back normal next year we‚Äôre making everything missed, overcompensating actually ;) Thanks detailed information! I'm healthcare worker *per se*, state employee inspects licenses residential healthcare facilities (group homes intellectually disabled). We've remote inspections time being--it's something, anywhere close effective in-person inspections. I'm unsure would included first batch vaccinations, certainly think would silly leave us out... We'll see! bar patrons committing crimes state? people asshats spread to??? ""If"" Fingers crossed Doesn‚Äôt matter. Children young adults don‚Äôt really even need vaccine.

Also, reminder, person said vaccine expert. don‚Äôt really know credibility say don‚Äôt think so.  probably way Les years... 1 million sounds alot think way less years  Point Lookout: allow introduce Yeah, doesn‚Äôt make sense. argument, shouldn‚Äôt laws all‚Äîmurder, rape, steal want, want to. But, time, imagine abortion would still no-no. risk accept yearly flu virus spreads around. What's artist playing? Listen lot Christian bands, happy remove someone catalogue they're playing something like Jebus thinks stupid too.......I spoke recently said ‚Äúare stupid‚Äù. It‚Äôs always mutating. 

That‚Äôs survival fittest evolution work. vaccine. under-25 year old gives flying fig. hope explode Oh weird posted Trump horse! it‚Äôs hard separate satire reality. one giant Onion article. travel restrictions. Florida government announced months ago done COVID. restrictions anywhere. mom saw one article highlighted Florida businesses opting kick patrons wearing masks. 

No mask mandates. temperature checks. stay home advisories. It‚Äôs straight government-approved anarchy there. exactly wanted. want blame someone, blame leadership there. feel guilty sick hospital. quams got sick. fucking people. article mention bubbles sports stars movie sets wasted thousands, hundred thousand tests celebrities get paid millions limited options rapid testing Williamsburg area, without symptoms, worries test won‚Äôt covered insurance 

A rapid test asymptomatic individual give false negative, paying lied to, creating false sense security potentially infecting people. coworker told daughter‚Äôs boss tested positive sometime Wednesday Friday....but talking 40 mins. said felt fine, masks don‚Äôt work, bad flu. didn‚Äôt know do, that‚Äôs closest I‚Äôve come Covid far. stressed out. weren‚Äôt expecting guys assume we‚Äôd hang homes year + hospitals got shit together. 

But are. guy Twitter tell lock grandma inside health wasn‚Äôt important freedom. I‚Äôm paraphrasing gist it. disgusting comment. Agreed. Even without restrictions there‚Äôs need increased feasible (affordable, get apt timely manor, reasonably get apt, etc) access mental health support. times uncertainty it‚Äôs even critical. 

For isolation rules, regulation place help living alone nominated person still able meet helps families split households example. Let's fair, Greek economy infrastructure already failing covid, covid made worse. I‚Äôm sorry, survival rate least 3% lower consider be, good amount people survive temporarily permanently affected severe way think made perfect argument public healthcare. pictures full hospitals hotspots? There‚Äôs * It‚Äôs lack basic human decency point. RemindMe! One month ""check us healthcare sys still functioning"" Reddit trash sick political shit vaccines going stop spread holidays. Even healthcare workers vulnerable elderly get vaccine mid-late December it‚Äôs hoped, full immunity people doesn‚Äôt kick 4-6 weeks time initial jab maybe around late January. ever used standard viral diseases?

We virus comes country yearly, poses biggest risk old young. could prevent almost deaths locking every winter. don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs silly. different?

Life living. Florida kind fucking sucks, man. One country welded people home, launched propoganda campaign convince population virus hoax. really questioning countries worse outcome? Roflmaoshicad seem selfish great example posts like exist. marginalizing peoples suffering basically saying bad sad bc people recover. simple fact is, people suffering, people dying, serves make matters worse people say things like did. credible scientists narratives arguing restrictive measures negative impacts. That's nothing straw man meant give platform people want downplay threat argue necessary restrictions. Remorse help personally...okay...but idiocy got stop. People dying selfish fools. Florida gonna Florida Save baby mink, hurt them. Posting realistic, fact-based timelines vaccine rollout automatic way get downvoted sub. people prefer optimistic lie truth. admire faith fellow man, really do, lifetime experience shown helplessly na√Øve situations like this. Anyway, government reduces people's rights time, laws almost definition structures guide behavior, question whether government restrict rights, answer apparently clearly yes, question instead ""by much?"". case pandemic, think could argue highly appropriate government enforces mask mandate, failure essentially guarantees people impede upon another's freedom putting risk death.   Must rate infections many dying  Excess deaths already well 200k early Oct. Population 126 million. Oh guarantee xmas advised. travel week make sure matter. Making mistake killing thief relatives choice theirs. Virtue scale. Personal responsibility never work everyone, need everyone good, needs backed up.

(see also environment, pregnancy, obesity...) Bright Side: mostly 45 supporters, so... 10 days would around 1.5 'weeks' guess. Yep. used RES tag every covid denier I've ever seen sub see action. many still active here. Draw will. live false reality. people literally dying covid using last breaths earth express disbelief thing actively killing them. sad workers like sacrifices appease kinds people. damn shame rave last night ft lauderdale, probably 80% people mask sight. article spot No, people selfish shitheads everywhere. Incidentally, lIKe SwEdEn people gone seems.

Just fun, search back posts April heavy astroturfing reopening US. Virtually accounts deleted. Sounds like resent professionals whose capacity use society extends beyond immediate location. Can't help that. utter cretins politicizing virus acting like real serious could gotten handle guess what? We'd back cushy actual offices much safer going margarita Chilis dipshit.

It's almost like successful mitigation economic recovery go hand hand who'd thought aside doctors, scientists, economists, people reading level 5th grade? don‚Äôt income tax, instead rely sales tax tourism spending large portion state budget. governor everything keep Florida top covid infection rate list, school system, necessary services don‚Äôt collapse bloated carcass state leadership. 

Fuck Ron Desantis. Y‚Äôall need stay home. Go Disney you‚Äôve vaccine. need adjusting. That's merit large random blinded placebo controlled trial. Considering vaccine expert literally said im taking word it. Yeah GA Techs model recommends assuming 5 10 times many positive cases reported given time. Same: I‚Äôm every day. 

Been following virus since early word novel virus China (epidemiology‚Äôs interest mine decades). could believe, watched get worse spread Wuhan lock ***no one anything*** ‚Äî like watching tsunami approach everyone beach keeps frolicking. üò£

Me, I‚Äôd rather see coming. I'm surprised low certainty evidence nine trials (3507 participants) wearing mask may make little difference outcome influenza‚Äêlike illness (ILI) compared wearing mask (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 1.18. moderate certainty evidence wearing mask probably makes little difference outcome laboratory‚Äêconfirmed influenza compared wearing mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants)

That's pretty clear stating evidence points masks ineffective. say better quality research needs done, systematic reviews/meta analyses RCTs best standard evidence currently - meaning supersede poorly controlled observational studies people usually cite claim masks work.

There course plenty pre-COVID research similar calibre finds masks useless preventing respiratory illness.

So yeah, get better quality evidence showing significant positive benefit masks, contend ineffective whether able admit not. never surprise, still always tragic, see many COVID deniers exist world. Particularly countries terrible job managing pandemic. Though say, blew one longest standing friendships beginning whole thing one ""lockdowns tyranny"" ""we shut highways, huh?"" people. patience whatsoever kinds people. Especially immediate circle. Mayor Bynum referring institution presidency; acknowledge general honor city host president simultaneously opposing parameters visit.

Christmas going disaster US year. Hate break you, us abide covid restrictions surrounded absolute morons irrespective live. sounds like Hispanic name, people know reason particularly vulnerable serious complications/death Covid. don‚Äôt understand disregard elder family members. kinda China Social Index Score days?

You really wanna go direction?  Derp derp derp. think toxic positivity "" PAY ATTENTION FEEL, SMILE WORK HARD IT, SUCCESS MINDSET OYU SUCCESSFUL FAULT SMILING OPPORTUNITIES DOOR ENOUGH !"" 

They usually express undermining emotions current mental state imaginary state success everything good 100% time even good even emotionally distraught . 

I think likely person committed avoiding bad new may fall toxic positiviy type expressions/ thinking slightly different things. 

One hiding sort negativity perceived negativity, outright denying reality negative emotions even they're there. thought called ""nose dicking"" True. Sensibly support ban unsafe gay sex. virus lasts 2ish weeks. reason end sight people keep spreading taking seriously. Look full hospitals are. economy ebbs flows ur parents,brothers sisters lives not. 

People wedding people died even part it. said deaths could prevented saying oh well people needed 300 person wedding middle pandemic. think old enough really grasp saying let alone understand what's going . know why? every generation challenges. generation faces challenges, I'm wondering, ever faced universal draft go seas fight 1-3 years? ever marched Trump country gotten dogs sicced you, bus bombed, beaten jailed? live country 2,500 bombings year happening police stations, universities etc? national guard troops opening fire rallies? Oh, top that, mortgage rate 15% stay line hour get gas.

So maybe garnering lot sympathy. I'm sorry say weak generation, literally pack fairies. know tweet whine. ones want fuck world cushy home offices delivered take food selfish? Get fucking high horse. em fun.

Yes none people grandparents, parents coworkers infect directly after. Better pull harder boot straps young fellow!  Ah, absolutely - definitely depends extent isolation maintained. clarified didn‚Äôt mean lockdown. Complete isolation incredibly tough putting life hold. many levels regulation what‚Äôs place complete lock down. Even lockdown, ‚Äòbubbles‚Äô created live own. get lockdown though, things like things like social distancing, staying within x miles residence, time outside exercise (possibly one person), x people one household inside (or maybe meeting outside start) help keep life moving. Florida, 18,000 reported deaths, would 15th hardest hit country world. every day wake open laptop work. That‚Äôs literally entire life right now. mental health terrible definitely fatigued. God insanity religions. Obviously, vaccines work Monday-Friday, distributing Saturday work well thought-out what-if scenario. However, could probably immigrate education, considering Vancouver area. Again, nothing thought in-depth, ""this country fucked, what?"" scenario. Seriously. I‚Äôd say something government‚Äôs ‚Äúresponse‚Äù would get removed. someone would say something Sweden‚Äôs strategy seemingly problem it. Incidentally, lIKe SwEdEn people gone seems.  Fuck Jerry Jones. I'd link removed see removed comment. I'd share content post (pic text), content post got banned imagine sharing sentiments would similar result.  Good. need start moving fast reasonably can.  Herd immunity trying get vaccinating though (or different name control spread virus get large portion population immune due infected vs vaccinated?) So, what's excuse proven wrong? ""What bunch selfish buffoons!""? FFS political trolls spread disinformation Covid intentionally misreading this. idiots banned yet? even try hide red hats intentionally spread bullshit meant absolve political heroes responsibility.    America selfish country. definitely decline Truly crusader status quo. were.  Man cannot wait visit. know survive this, maybe die feel sad about. Someone needs set stand one rallies sell participation trophies lol Dr Fauci doesn‚Äôt seem think TP must flow. shit anyway. Atreideez nuts. think highly unlikely.
Any new wave imported, escape strict much improved quarantine controls, seed undetected long enough without stomped on.

If happen anywhere would bet WA. largely escaped whole thing, much first wave either... population bit complacent. government tight lockdown surprise me. age, chances dying 2%. Let em fun.

Also, plenty Westerners understand exponent is. Western culture looks high IQ people interested math science. America, high IQ introverts understand math science get bullied, silenced, beaten up.

Oh definitely offending me. 22 year olds going partying huge crowds blamed infecting others? Even people wearing masks, there's still chance getting infected another person. People need stop selfish start caring people. Thats thing gonna stop spreading exponentially. matter 22 years old need party reason. sit ass home. Fortunately, people hospital contagious anymore. question contaminated covid tests:

My father law going New York son tested airport. received positive tests didn‚Äôt tell anyone, believe bc asymptomatic didn‚Äôt believe results. cat let bag New York family side. father telling partner tests contaminated that‚Äôs tested positive later cleared (they test again). possible cleared tested ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù begin with? lie cover potentially active outbreak? current infection rate continues US, 6 months least 10% US population infected. placebo group representative entire population, since placebo confers immunity. would expect otherwise?

Likewise, already 6 months since vaccine administered stage 1 trial group. immunity drops significantly time possible tell already. Although possibility new strain messes everything... one‚Äôs checking though  Also true. ground stand telling people ok joke about. them, joker, understand limits can't handle. person lost close one due covid, going place like r/coronavirus reading comment section last thing mental health.

Great pulled time scale US two three weeks behind Europe wave, get soon. :( That's sad. Remember negative test could mean virus replicated enough yet make sure keep ppe going even test.

Hawaii point secede America's dumpster fire. enough Pacific Islanders Asians make liveable society. cases March people different countries got stranded abroad numbers Saturday. weekends always lower. 

What's really scary Oregon's testing consistently abysmal. We've never tested anywhere near amount people should. official cases can't fraction what's there. 

I've consistently careful since beginning gone really except necessary errands socially distant outdoor happy hours two friends. worried, really, going couple grocery stores week specialty items wanted. really good mask compliance area people generally COVID-mindful.

France opens early without keeping key restrictions place, it'll lead another new bigger wave. Regarding time gain immunity booster, you‚Äôre confusing length time trials waited measure antibody levels actual time obtain sufficient antibody levels. vaccine people said don‚Äôt know long takes develop antibody response vaccination, know 28 days sufficient levels. trials didn‚Äôt measure antibody levels every day, measured day 28.

Until another animal regurgitates covid back us new form. aborted fetus literally innocent defenseless human life killed mother.

Shame dehumanizing literal human beings. US EU - others suffer stupidity. 

The incidence Adelaide clamped fast, contact tracers traced 2-3 deep, masks something norm, medical system free, jobs sick leave, employers given money, actions swift proportionate real threat. don‚Äôt know people seem rooting ‚Äúmostly normal next summer‚Äù anti-vaccination people .... think just, reason, *want* covid-19 lifestyle last longer should. Like said, maybe got mindset going much longer 12-18 months, fight notion won‚Äôt be? don‚Äôt know. Saw many people social media partying bars Denver area. thought Colorado better control this. me, end January. teach Chinese students. spent 6 weeks holding breathing thinking wtf. dumbass knew virus would wreck us. US government failed us. Technically won‚Äôt every citizen country everywhere pay least taxes? Like directly, indirectly? get saying government implemented UBI, even temporarily, sooo many people would actually able stay home many schools could actually close. course people healthcare workers need keep working therefore still need childcare. think it‚Äôs safe say Mcdonalds essential business every single one workers home UBI. Yes, necessarily daily rate you‚Äôve implied. Exponential across time span similarly intermittent. also (as meant above) used mean exponential rate, factor ten (e.g. 3 becomes 9 becomes 27 2 becomes 4 becomes 6)

I think issue comes attempt use concrete, mathematical term vaguely, term directly relates so-called R-value (i.e. rate transmission). virus cured go back eating. especially sucks 81 counties Kansas didn‚Äôt follow mask mandate, compared 24 counties *did* follow it. 

(Though assume mask mandate counties populous urban areas) pictures people shoulder shoulder airports masks , it‚Äôs going lead sad Christmas lot people  ""Why keep trying say word?"" really lost cause self awareness. Americans think like reason we're still stuck situation. Stop selfish doesn‚Äôt explain Vietnam socialist economy 35 deaths though. Especially still ~96,000,000 people. ONE WANTS WEAR MASK

Not shave kind nice. get cyberpunk vaccine news Hanukkah? NICE Hey man Cowboys used great! stopped cocaine. least, Biden gets in. even then, Georgia runoffs Dems, stimulus passed incredibly watered Mitch Amen friend. want implement Canada

No, test program see works. works well, see airports. doesn't, probably won't. disputing fact, need prove fact. Taiwan defacto state characteristics De Jure quantifiers considered country.  Even ROC never declared Taiwan independent country still believe they're ruler China. important make distinction province, Taiwan's covid-19 measures consistent Chinese provinces experience similar number cases low death counts.  love it! I've quarantining parents. moment, I'd prefer cats. (No, I'm fortunate position quaratine parents, given ages, like. dad tries go grocery shopping one time week, I'm going tackle him.) cats eat Lil Soups though, makes sad they're cute. view basically give friskies wet food, give death. Please give another game thrones quote. Fucking nerds I‚Äôd bet 4 passengers within 6 feet guy. doesn‚Äôt really prove ‚ÄúMass infection via airflow‚Äù people. still pass virus infected even vaccinated. Normal know probably year two away. anything look forward to. one wave doesn‚Äôt end, another really begin? pay wise feedback loop come play (although think happen here) citizens living affected areas wear mask misinformation asking went wrong?

Why areas get hit much harder? misinformed masks? **Should doubt current information sources??**

One hope sort cognitive thought applied facts. Lots Ohio, Michigan &amp; Wisconsin people Key West. I'm surprised see ICU go guess perhaps that's deaths. Trump demanding recount. Lol

Your rights stop endangering others. Grow learn live society. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs model- lets go PARTY!!!! WOOOOOO!!!!!‚Äù Unemployed Canadian here, could pay 50 bucks hour enforce mask rules states... Correct wrong, thats good way get shot stabbed no? could probably get Covid 19, flu, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Meningitis time. ibs gerd, guess means get covid I'm dead sure, hurrah /s. really. 

They enough data make pretty educated estimates. understand, want to, can't. government enough money support businesses would need closed total lockdown stuck rock hard place. can't close everything can't let everything open either -using Google Chrome rly? news, water wet.  people rely much masks feel ""as long I'm wearing mask"" whatever want. Masks part puzzle. Wtf really? NH finally got mask mandate governor states touching us...wish weren‚Äôt. Well President lied us, er downplayed, pandemic months ""he want create panic"".  

He knew deadly deadly stuff downplayed it.  Even obvious deadly deadly stuff he's still ""downplaying"" day even though panicking realize he's intentionally misleading us. Dear Leader right you. Wait, he's golfing? Sorry, please hold. afford professional security, choose spend money that. Walmart made huge profit pandemic. mean wore masks distanced didn‚Äôt large gatherings could arrange ‚Äúherd‚Äù manner R0 would low enough pseudo herd immunity, w/o restrictions even 60% herd immunity threshold optimistic. think mask wearing people put MUCH stock mask. (not denying masks) might think, ""Oh, wear masks, I'm good,"" slack things. Masks one part puzzle, part. Usually issue CDC speak scientifically, people misinterpret say, famous tweet saying ""was evidence H2H transmission COVID"". people understood evidence H2H transmission COVID.  problem finding doctors nurses staff well. know people already gotten covid still traveling. care even less getting it. really help vast majority people, symptoms serious. beauty-contest style choosing leaders failed US.

And caused **THAT**? Stupidity inaction people. Manipulation, division greed. Viruses exist reason. Stop trying control nature. Humans supposed immortal. Agreed. Probably referring communion rituals: ‚ÄúThis body, take eat. blood, take drink.‚Äù Neither seatbelts parachutes. Get fuck nonsense argument. wedding May 22nd, please let true. Let's end fact checked like wanted Pfizer accept dime government money. fear not, mod that. assure you

Donald, you? closed 5% gyms. That's like clinching cheeks 5% say holding poop in. Using reference ""sweden closing down"" seen spreading disinformation. know exactly I'm talking about, act dumb. well that's tell you..lol...even Chinese associates say trust government. much proactive. cases, lock mass testing. people complain tyranny losing freedoms here...go China see makes think twice spoiled here. delete comment. dont go ASU know kind shit pull. go regularly get tested summoned take random test basically day getting test. lock people accounts never go campus filling health check accessed app barely works. refunds 800 dollar parking passes suddenly became useless classes 2x less effective. people also stop posting ad wall articles?  US incredibly generous unemployment benefits lost jobs lockdown. ""all got"" $1200 means actually lose job. feel like there's already Dan Brown novel this. amazed doctor speaks health partiers themselves: that's important, much larger problem covid-19 asymptomatic spread. college kids going get infected, asymptomatic, contribute spread. would surprised ft laudedale superspreader event :-( Inessential travel banned criminalized. 

Unless one advocate banning criminalizing it, they, IMO, right complain someone it. prob dont even exercise lol So, gonna post video not? We're waiting. Thank you. least someone else enough logic get it. We‚Äôre seeing sheltered Americans been.  reminder, terrified people required attend crowded gatherings  ""He power destroy thing absolute control it."" NO.

Iran culturally Middle Eastern, Eastern. Middle Eastern culture civilization, distinct Western, South Asian, Eastern cultures. thought another season? Love show Yep. Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas &amp; New Years real vaccine immunity. It‚Äôs expected general population get vaccinated Q2 (maybe Q3) 2021 [source: Scott Gottlieb, Pfizer board member former FDA Commissioner). lot virus community then. Hopefully though healthcare workers vulnerable elderly get initial vaccine death rate reduce, again, won‚Äôt full immunity family holidays. 

I‚Äôm grateful living somewhere that‚Äôs essentially Covid-free normal Christmas (we don‚Äôt Thanksgiving country). I‚Äôm really worried US Europe though, especially heading winter. want get one shouldnt able go work kids shouldnt able go school. shots gonna kill make kids autistic. finally see light end tunnel hope people 6 brain cells fuck everyone else. Man, really take extremely context. say ‚Äúeconomically disadvantaged people idiots‚Äù, imply it. look read carefully see said, ‚Äúidiots people economically disadvantaged‚Äù. also satiated said thing. said idiots idiots gonna complain pay shot, thus won‚Äôt get it. idiots could millionaires care, still idiots complaining. started talking economically disadvantaged people, said hopeful sort system place allow get shot. Please read carefully don‚Äôt take things context. sucks masks work, largely work preventing people spreading others. Creates terrible lack incentives personally responsible. matter think. lockdown. closing public city-owned gyms (5% gyms city). need proper lockdown. LOL. race mods!  Like said. Risk drastically lowered mask usage smart choices. risk populations need making smart choices. Many not. 


""100% effective"" 


100% golden unicorn, nothing 100%. Stop chasing it.


Also sure offended please say fuck. MHRA rolling reviews Pfizer Oxford vaccine getting data dumped once. even looks crowd like thinks ""Ooh gonna fun""? scare quotes? kill you... makes florida man. arent 100% effective. truly wish covid deaths would happen irresponsible assholes ignoring health guidelines. I'm sorry collateral/community spread. Unfortunately selfish Florida Man going cause lot death. Blame them. mean, message ""despite us followed recommendations (masking, hygiene) skipped family gathering rule still got sick"". dumb, perhaps coming story may make people realize gatherings worth it. Pretty identifiable. don‚Äôt understand lack creativity either. I‚Äôm kind excited different year. thing year year gets boring. wife driving 4 hours Thanksgiving family, eight us total. We're meeting people outdoors we're staying hotel. one person allowed house time. 

This sensible solution extremely low likelihood transmission. type thing advocated instead Zoomgiving. Right now, dilemma appears Zoomgiving (LOL elderly figuring Zoom) traditional, indoor extended family Thanksgiving. Reddit terrible representation general public work home techies overrepresented can't imagine people wanting zoomgiving concept. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get want, get earn.‚Äù

-Erwin von Kink Absolutely. virus restrictions necessitates handle. set preparing late January time people started talking lockdown stripping store shelves state, fully stocked mentally prepared. idea many people going spend next many months everything could make problem worse.

It very, unpleasant surprise. people spend rest year hospital. Won‚Äôt assets distribute hospital die gets cut anyway. üçøüò∑üçø called it. Apparently speculating comment got locked somehow civil. mayor got covid. wishing gets deserves. county went blue Biden, lots red there.  Australia, you?

Much makes sense, everyone crowds cities, rabbit hutch 'apartments' stacked high developer make killing (especially start falling down).

The win Australia people spread out, population pretty much city-states considered separate entities, bugger inbetween. can't. Many Western cultures promote empathy compassion others. especially true Europe. 

Latin American culture also promotes empathy, compassion, collectivism. 

Yet cultures failed.    Ran prisoners help? Gambler's fallacy opposite. thinking winning number X last time, chance **not-X** next time.

The distinction significant. Assuming number X last time chance X **not** necessarily fallacy. example, imagine number 19 came 30 games row. two possible hypotheses make sense:

1. machine fair, number 19 happened picked bunch times row

2. machine biased toward number 19 - maybe ball weighs something - case 19 really likely picked turn 31

Gamblers fallacy would third hypothesis:

3. 19 come 30 times row, there's way come again. (Or alternatively - 17 picked 30 games, pick 17 soon).

The first two valid hypotheses, third fallacy. freedom comes responsibility. Something proven time throughout history Americans sorely forgotten it. makes shit up? Let's quit Truman show already!  they're going need vax that's shelf stable, pill form, mailed. 

&amp;#x200B;

..this frozen crap going work kind time frame (even though Moderna's normal freezers).. even distribution goes ***perfectly***, still poke arm.. (twice)... many arms. Lol government? mean orange bum white house deranged staff? Oh. canNOT even believe needs said. 

Should policy get on, there‚Äôs case you‚Äôre board, you‚Äôre staying on. Yep. Extreme individualism assumes everyone living vacuum, intentional breaches people's personal space affects society.

Whereas collectivist nations understand butterfly effect: every action take, even intended personal private, sets chain reactions. Everyone's personal private actions end affecting people.  technically tomato also fruit. concept here

How analogy supposed true irrelevant reflect situation.

I mean, shut gyms museums. article says slow spread, suggest spread control close it. reflective current situation? Wow, thought France stupid useless test policy. That's really impressive! voting kinda...happens. Costco private property. whatever want people wear masks. Well anything within law... can't, example, detain cut legs off. used work Costco meat hot dogs comes from. That's call selfish. largest mass casualty event 2020. Better tinfoil hat people claiming election fraud.  funny one situation real evidence.... Well, do. second wave peaked Europe, month two probably peak USA well. next year vaccine. Newport, SD, secret parties SF, warm vacation destinations. 0.1% million people still lot people. Ft. Lauderdale, everywhere that's open business. got video people one bar Texas town bars clubs open, probably full maskless people really interesting way labelling regions.

""Eastern Mediterranean"" (presumably meaning ""Middle East""; doubt includes Balkans) really odd one. I've heard called ""West Asia"" before, makes sense Indian news sources, Eastern Mediterranean new me.

Also interesting China/Japan/Korea lumped together Australia rather rest Asia. 2%?

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* planning 'regular' wedding October 2021 realistic no? people keep worshipping guy ? 

If truthful, say ""it's gonna painful"", would say ""we need shut everything yesterday"".

If wanted hear someone telling gonna painful, i'd go BDSM meeting.

His diplomas useless, saved life, high school dropout could tell gonna painful. sm happy fsmily agree travel meet up. Why? found friend emt much made furious. think absolute tragedy someone integral country's wellbeing would paid little (while literally saving lives) yet celebrities make thousands IG plugs shitty weight loss products. Yeah seems headline could apply vast majority states. Except like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, maybe others.

But tbf Alabama news website lol Thank Trump that. use current numbers calculate death rate people get infected. Currently healthcare systen cope least partitially amount infected people. take current amount, multiply 10, think hospital looks like then, affect treament people probelsm. Death toll much higher.... We're sight vaccine, final stretch right?  post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* point know need protect others. Amazing can‚Äôt get large segment population cooperate. You‚Äôve saying one ‚Äúat least there‚Äôs lot deaths‚Äù crowd.

Which, 250k isn‚Äôt lot you, I‚Äôd hate see is. holly jolly Christmas! 

It‚Äôs best time year!

I don‚Äôt know there‚Äôll snow!

But hopefully it‚Äôs cold enough bodies don‚Äôt rot morgues overflow! Wait German CDC named word use acknowledging sneeze?!

That's badass. stupid, people paranoid government's ""newfound power"" tell people end dictatorship. People need understand moderation thing. Keep mind CONFIRMED cases, everybody gets confirmed. tickets booked go home. Cancelled last week.. 75 Sunny week upcoming week I've got off. Bought 15 dollar turkey.. could worse! Yes! mind boggling give advice, even though people already travel plans clearly travel regardless. 

The test foolproof, probably skip Thanksgiving 80 yr old grandma regardless, there's many cases risk tolerance bit higher, harm reduction go long way.

Highly recommend following Michael Mina, Harvard epi making big push universal rapid Nope, still full shit. don‚Äôt trust him. law assembly shit. we‚Äôre digressing. Coming back topic hand - reason enough dismiss way got Covid control? that‚Äôs absurd.  ritzy schools like Duke, Princeton, etc use large parts endowments make sure money issue get in, usually need blind admissions. went Duke grad school free friend went Princeton undergrad free. need quotes ""need"". doubt Americans truly need work. safety net. Even unemployment pay may take months get, get all. ""need"" live indoors eat. given ""options"". You‚Äôre going catch people actively spreading via tests take 2-3 days process considering spread peaks day symptoms start lasts days. got tested day 1 2 infection, you‚Äôre almost certain test negative, show Thanksgiving, spread it, show symptoms day after. It‚Äôs really hard harm reduction COVID via testing unless you‚Äôre ignoring symptoms rambling about? gave birth 7 weeks ago! lots scares work thankfully never caught it. guys it! Never let anyone pressure gatherings. worth it. Congrats! [Not exactly looking pretty Conspiracy theorists German kind. Absolute idiots picked state random headline, you? think fucking hilarious. Leftists getting PTSD moralizing fearporn love propagate. leftists worst enemies, sadly time end mass grave like times Unfortunately attacking morons wearing mask still illegal. people you‚Äôre touting want another lockdown government support. Literally conversations I‚Äôve seen another lockdown go hand hand need government payout support original comment quoting Trump satire? twitter would source quote that, I'd think. Yup. got tower climbing, wanted get took year get EMT IV cert. found paid (and I‚Äôm high rental area) went straight back tower climbing, degree, working way 5-6x pay experienced EMT. It‚Äôs sad really. could get spit on, shot, kicked, lit fire, BIT, kicked, exposed traumatic events, that‚Äôs pay works. (Or doesn‚Äôt work say) They're sarcastic.

Companies governments taken framing global issues largely influenced problem personal responsibility individuals responsible for. Instead addressing things like coal power, industrial carbon output, inefficient shipping practices, etc instead say need buy hybrid stop global warning minuscule carbon footprint what's *really* causing climate change.

In way, COVID-19 they're framing people getting virus irresponsible, instead things like mask mandates, surge testing, limited capacity enforcement, lockdowns, forcing jobs done remotely WFH, etc. individuals *can* make decisions reduce risk getting virus, even people everything right getting virus overall infections high result government good job setting rules leading people strong pro-social behavior. poor souls raging die hoax ones trouble me.

The species issues capable sort self delusion... Please link said 250k lot..

I'll wait. mine mouth 3 days ago three weeks:

News announcer 1: ""How could happening!?""

People like stayed home: ""The mind... fucking... *boggles.*"" point I'm pretty sure us believe we'd get closer truth measuring EVERYTHING hear whether ""TRUMP said it"".
Like:
D: ""Going mild winter, Bob!""
B: ""Yeah?! Well, that's alright me, Dan! Say, where'd hear that?""
D: ""Our boy, Donny, says so! YupYpYup, winter's going like every flu season, also BEST, gone know minimal losses. H'says people going impacted weather winter ones already vulnerable cold, so.... looks like we're good! (Dan says he's splitting last wood cut property....)
B: ""Well, praise be, Dan! Hey, remember Darlene lent y'all threat generator hurricane? go ahead get back?""
D: ""NOPE!"" üëÜ Mine going virtual week. Many students informed missing day two class travel. One student going fly multiple times see SIDES family, one ultra hot spot, holiday. glad won‚Äôt seeing person again. Two students already Covid, though fortunately exposed break didn‚Äôt see them. don‚Äôt get paid enough this. school schools. passive immunity temporary. Eventually, even winter, could infected again. virus wipes us least China around competent us wore mask immune. Genuine question: reason using article April evidence regarding numbers reported today?

Also, article gives clear rationale numbers updated, stated ""While so-called excess deaths explicitly linked virus, might happened outbreak occurred, part overwhelmed normal health care system."". 

This comparing number deaths one year another, showing strange anomaly 3,700 excess deaths (not directly linked covid) occured time period compared prior years.

Also, additional 3,700 deaths added assessment time 11th March 13th April. numbers reported TODAY additional length time assessment.

Don't take wrong way, numerous holes logic lot conclusions leapt to. happen anything date suspicious rationally though explained article April? Comparing UK America exactly fair though, seeing 4-5 states population density UK‚Äôs overall population density, many states far lower density  depends state really. teachers shit pay, states make twice much average American. still average job general .. worded facetiously, but: dislike government agencies dumbing guidelines comprehensible layman, sounds contradictory know source truth. People think oh I'm 6 feet away I'm fine. No, least 6 feet impractical stores accommodate even larger gaps. Yes. works, senseless. pure bullshit. Norway. still go bars, barely used mask ever. Compared rest world, life pretty normal. 1 deaths home city area among 250k people.which happened start April. true summer restrictions prerty much non-existent.

Here difference Sweden though. set restrictions whenever amount people testing positive goes up. start, people idea going on, protect ones need it, total lockdown. summer, numbers infected 1 million per day, relaxed regulation lot. Now, numbers going again, strickter regulations set country, specifically areas higher numbers. already killing second wave. 

This comparable Swedish approach. coworker separate two pieces paper handing me. could emailed me. remarked ""These damn masks make hard lick fingers""

Let's shoot earth sun point. Almost certainly. Pfizer gave FDA mountain data review takes time. truer words spoken know sounds cruel, people taking every precaution get this. people get priority comes medical treatment. Anyone ignored rules put bottom list. bot deserved it. would non-bots butt please? I‚Äôm busy. Still nothing South Dakota either. Governor said recently leaving personal responsibility. Yep - conservative messaging heavily centered around fear, much actual policy. Scare voters thinking Joe Biden usher era communism degeneracy Even supplies, violence occur defiant populace. lot people quite edge, even pandemic. Don‚Äôt think anyone would stomach military effectively inciting shootout civilians, even lockdown. English person (whose politics also 5 years devolved nationalism, ""freedom"", disguised bigotry, politicisation events coronavirus, heart goes you. Chair Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, begging Congress months keep steady flow stimulus going. threat economy far greater lack federal stimulus whatever deficit spending stimulus requires. literally print money, due higher US savings rate need borrow international market. nooooo, let's make political fuck millions Americans, sounds like *MUCH* better pan.  works there? stay open sell certain amount food? know works way places. yet COVID spreading fast US daily death counts quickly rising past month.

Other countries able use means prevent disease, past 9 months proven vaccine thing stop COVID US. know coming from. I'm traveling T-day, planning visit family Christmas. family self quarantining visit, we're driving 8 hours straight get there; stopping gas. Rates infection comparable locations. see dangerous normal daily lives. 

People talk spreading travel, already everywhere like there's risk bringing somewhere new. wearing mask make suicidal. understand getting at.

if things go really well things could back much normal time next year. 

but masks common sense lot reasons. too. I'm assuming analyze data, although process would feel expedient simply rolling meetings announce conclusion reach one, instead set arbitrarily selected date. Christmas Eve, state health officials Nebraska [made influenza mandatory quarantine disease, fines ranging $15 $100 violations. Approximately 1,000 homes Omaha placarded, occupants unable leave least four days fever subsided.

It's interesting see enforcement pandemics lockdowns century ago country today. Well authorities might well try reverse psychology point. large team doctors scientists need review mountain data Pfiser giving them. takes long time, I'm sure going fast can. Science takes time, rushed much.  sure Manzhoul locked down, possibly economy less important China Tianjin.

That's exactly reason why. Another would Tianjin resources ICU beds case things actually flare up. we've seen US rural communities hit hardest. Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, HK, ~~Singapore~~

Edit: Singapore counted island different times. people actually means rebel back then. kind weapons government makes impossible fight them. even able mount rebellion 0 privacy. fuck gave wholesome award?? least saw writing wall gets closer them. Imagine much worse would still insistent wallowing virus laden environments unmasked passing sundry fever shortness breath sets in. 18 hours exposure long time. positive covid test mean lockdown cannot socialize El Paso also takes patients areas like New Mexico exacerbates issue. people persist claiming ""island makes different""?

Countries states borders, control them. want limit crossing them, so. That's happened Australia states put limits people crossing state borders. Island come it.

Remember Australia big US also states - action closing borders real efforts going internal states spill over. Island really kind relevant. Um... know get infected *from* passengers?

Sounds like fear mongering. Yea still get mad person lit house fire also worry putting water point. kind money begin with, rely charity rich asshole improve society. Australia numerous episodes community transmission, we've managed control. mean island matter cases yeah.

um.

they care. study history, math, biology, logic, number things would help here.

they want selfish. I'd say least 1 5 already it. state premiers *pressure* federal government take covid seriously, federal government put responsibility onto states, need act themselves.

The feds taken every chance could undermine states covid (especially they're Labor state). 

They even Border Force quarantine (one things meant do), instead pushed states programs, goes wrong (which multiple states already), Morrison take responsibility.  following thread correctly, replying you. Wait what? thought they'd mostly empty year.  already caught trying everythin power to, stupidity always come top covid Bunch r/Sino people subreddit shilling innocence . Can‚Äôt exonerate Chinese government shit every country Draconian lockdowns times (sorry; every country world isn‚Äôt island tries lockdowns, work, open everything starts again. need vaccine, assholes) ""They die""


""They care me"" many people line cell phone, two cars, cable, multiple flat screen TVs? percentage people already infected. infect everyone come together celebrate Thanksgiving. expect jump 3 6 days after. Gigafucked drunk? history respiratory viruses anything go by, immunity likely wear little months. You‚Äôre fat that‚Äôs you‚Äôre fucked. Y‚Äôall keep preaching cases know 99.997% survival rate gonna convince one. I‚Äôm hearing might actually 6x many cases previously thought? know 6x many cases means 6x *less* deadly previously thought? Y‚Äôall fucked one gives shit bullshit anymore  Current grad student Duke agree they've done great job semester.  could CEO afford third vacation home? C'mon man think papers gathered stay home social distancing compliance?

Mass cell phone location data collection. politicize vaccinating covid done donning mask, could make hard reopen. Hoping people finally get sick covid realize it‚Äôs serious make better choices. Don‚Äôt wanna sound gloaty, glad live Australia understand article trying convey rationing indicate stores *wouldn't* able keep shelves full free-for-all buying scenario would mean supply chain not, fact, ""fine"". might enough supply *in* chain, needs right places chain too.

I remember learning JIT college, Toyota gold standard case studies. interesting see companies go back true JIT adopt hybrid approach ""after times"". outback empty. Apart roos snakes. Australia‚Äôs *population density* pretty darn high, mostly gather 7 coastal cities. 

When clusters got going, local state governments **shut everything down** (while federal government whinged background). People moaned bitched it, worked. Restrictions got lifted we‚Äôre *not* storing corpses refrigerated vans ice rinks morgues full.

Its got nothing size, population, position. willingness local leaders take unpopular positions impose swift, brutal lockdowns. one exception Mark McGowan Western Australia, exceptionally popular result decision hard close WA border. that‚Äôs whole barrel worms I‚Äôm getting into.

Look SE Asian countries handling like pros - thing - long borders, loads people, again, swift total lockdowns wearing masks, allows contact tracing time space really get work. conservative administration year was:

Help people stimulus checks, keep rent/mortgages kicking people homes, ensure everything keep spread low lockdowns masks, giver nurses/doctors adequate supplies. Could‚Äôve easy win across entire election. 

But no, fight tooth nail everything single 1200 stimulus huge portion citizens (while ignoring people 17-24). Huge drop money business lost income yet still fired employees hoarded it. based mostly day Exactly, there's nothing meaningful dates. nostalgia reckless. Make new memories new times. can't wrap head around people able inconvenienced 12-24 month period. 

You giving life living fear. responsible mindful temporarily live rest life better. deal illness like 100 years. ok play safe fraction life century disaster like hits. 

Risk die little bored sad live another couple decades more. Seems laughably simple easy yet are. You‚Äôll probably die, fat people way shorter life expectancy general sooo \^\^\^ ... there's certain group think end control measures economy magically return overnight. reality going feeling economic impact long, long time Americans vaccinated. recovery going cost many trillions ... far $500 billion skinny bill Mitch McClueless.  yep, preventing people dying flu great byproduct hand sanitizing generally staying TF away people. call stupid state Misery nothing. Fucking stay home!!! I‚Äôm spending thanksgiving alone even though family state give damn people. see red coworkers talk upcoming get whole fucking family together Covidsgiving. live bubble. Historically tended away major events. always last learn. pay it. bit disappointed German tracing

It's really lacking point non-existent. Probably cultural thing. Fewer 25% population Corona contact tracing app installed. absence tracking contact tracing relies almost exclusively people warning others themselves.

Testing also going shit. Germany 2-3% positive tests spring. 9.5%, way 5% recommends try achieve. Therefore can't even compare numbers first wave - enough testing done current data reliable.

It's better than, say, Poland shattering 45% positive tests (which makes covid statistics almost completely meaningless), Germany still really failing responding second wave. least vast majority people actually wear masks around here. They've given feel nothing lose, unfortunately there's effort give people incentives continue make sacrifices, morale defeated army constantly retreat girlfriend‚Äôs friend lives Florida. Every single night she‚Äôs club/fancy restaurant it‚Äôs full people. later night she‚Äôll crowded apartment party go night. 

It‚Äôs big fuck everyone taking seriously really hate people act like we‚Äôve done everything cases going open everything back up. huge portion country isn‚Äôt following guidelines all. Makes sense. Thanks sharing. sort see logic though...it‚Äôs guaranteed they‚Äôll catch COVID thanksgiving dinner, may live another year anyway - especially they‚Äôre older greatest health - risk might worth them. Americans can‚Äôt nice things $100 1918 $2k today.  live IL going NC. NC one states isolation encouraged (tbh list like 40 states point). WFH rarely see anyone it‚Äôs much effort, got groceries two weeks. think it‚Äôs worth case, specially since doesn‚Äôt change routine much. spread 5 million people left Wuhan Chinese New Year, yet 50 million ~~Americans~~ *self-absorbed assholes US* still travel Thanksgiving *to murder grandparents, relatives, friends, strangers passing...*

FTFY. It‚Äôs insanity, absolute insanity. lost almost little faith humanity bad, feeling same. toss bit ""this whole area seem care"" guess i've got depression mixed fomo realization things getting better anytime soon  Seems like you‚Äôve taken right precautions safe can. Enjoy time Family cdc study linked article, mask mandated counties went 17 16 cases per 100,000. non-mandating counties went 6 12 per 100,000. yes end non mask counties still lower. That's Reddit bro. suggestion pay attention local situation rather world. sub's content involves pessimism extremely bad mental health. use common sense (mask, social distance) keep looking ahead we're nightmare. Keep taking care yourself. case across entire country fairly soon. Get car get caution, hospital available resources take care emergency become rare luxury US. Dude look vaccine-trust statistics Europe. ‚Äúenlightened land‚Äù trusts vaccines America. Quite opposite actually. Transfer graduated pipets, common culture media, staining reagent, list goes on!

And that's even touching actual virology testing kits reagents. exactly worded way imply something scary true here? Unique form COVID found Northern Nevada

That's bland article title I've seen while. think overreacting, intentionally. Glad hear Adelaide handled well. 80 year old uncle lives there. point doesn‚Äôt happen developed countries. Yawn.

You realise undisputed champion whole thing Taiwan,right? Dude, you‚Äôre making lot assumptions me. stop, come pedestal. probably owned car pandemic. know much paid old is. Take judgment elsewhere. Third world shit hole countries Asia Africa laughing y'all government initiated protests by, despite pandemic, amending existing legislation basically banning already limited abortion rights Poland had, people got pissed. However, massive increase cases time protests after. CARES act run millions/will run within month. self employed/independent contractors longer able claim unemployment all. want within laws states in. airports open state going accepting travel, go see family. Wear mask, wash hands, mindful touch. 50 million lowball  Powell really wants stimulus smart move would come right declare minimum dollar amount package (ie: ""no less $1 trillion"") would force McConnell Senate Republicans move absurdly insufficient skinny bills. Usually, someone talks invisible beings gets confined soft room allowed sharp things might them. nutjob get missed? Let‚Äôs manipulate people raw numbers instead percentages. 139.9 million people US 1945, lost \~416,000 .29 percent. lose 471k COVID US population 330 million .14 percent.

Buuuut lives created equal!? Yeah World War 2 people died young healthy adults, future country. Covid19 primarily kills elderly. There‚Äôs big difference. far plan move goal posts? 8 months stupidity resulted 250K dead Americans. grim predictions us 400-500K dead we're vaccinated. prediction 50 million dead next 6 weeks? hate thinking intelligent 50% population, let alone anyone matter say lot stupid shit. Irregardless...just kidding. Regardless penchant towards self deprecation, feel like looser version Newton Bohr whenever I'm forced see light day resupply amongst general population.

Shit makes cringe thinking, ""huh, I'm fucking genius next jackwagon, asshats.""

Edit: I'm not, consider genius. using real geniuses metaphorical example stupid huge percentage fellow countrymen women are. apples oranges comparison though? relatively isolated Wuhan traveling helped spread previously. point time virus already everywhere. Traveling make worse, really comparable Wuhan situation. Jesus Christ, wtf wrong there's going issues vaccinating many people infected. people administering vaccines start getting sick people turn vaccine appointment covid going slow things down. really? That's shocking. good news. Even comes preconditions use Windows 8 on? Well, immunocompromised person, I'm gonna die. last weeks? I'm leaning towards finding lots kittens puppies pet. Maybe bunnies? Possibly watching Adventure Time. screwed. even estimate this....? Americans please listen, yeh lockdown shit. Irish man cant go pub. understand unnatural. go work roofer cant got clothing shop buy warm clothes work weather work in. need socks man. New Zealand real. stay supervised hotel. people died it, spread well. grocery shopping changed zero, I've delivery trend since showed up. haaate grocery shopping. poor 80 year old dad finally retired he's bored. Grocery shopping daily excitement I'm standing front door like... ""I tie chair"". hard change habits! get back daily shops soon! Deaths measure deaths, nothing more. Cases dropped dramatically June 18th. Ramping testing doesn‚Äôt make cases drop. would mean cases would found existed.

Of course social distancing works, that‚Äôs caused cases drop. Trump incompetent. next Trumpist likely won‚Äôt be. thing saved us second term incompetence, party sees Trumpism winning strategy moving forward. FYI top spreaders found r/nsfw  think put quotes. artificial need, created shitty system USA. one really ""needs"" work they're happy much, except USA, people work healthcare. Whether said true, relevant Americans now? know, many months started? probably sitting facing 2 feet away talking laughing 3 hours. vaccines thoroughly tested controlled environment used public

[^(Send ^(|) [^(Github - ^(|) [^(Github - Chrome 40% last year LMAO GOP legislature already it. ""Prove caught work""....and courts accepting it, giving employers immunity need. I'm saying US follow Chinas response. However, basic measures wearing masks, lockdowns, testing completely Ignored one world's wealthiest nations.

I also brought SK example successful response. Yup. feel greatly overreacted 9/11 seeing little care 80 times number deaths. see spike riots, surprisingly enough. Agree stupid thing times, many states indeed stay home months (NY'er here... definitely did, masks, social distancing everything). think countries small minority anti-maskers... unfortunately current president fueling fire. I'm sure people kill also comfortable choice. know virus spreads? Editing: hell said 300,00 world wide? ... idea... yea... u/nedonedonedo said. 1.3 million also 1/5th testing per one finds current wave bit less terrifying April know we‚Äôre dealing with? Yeah, sounds like everything would played one particular channel TV US... Hard say. mean Fauci thinks next winter pretty much back normal many experts think summer close normal. chances could normal wedding next October.

However still many questions answers set stone. you, would plan normal wedding keep plan contingencies case still dealing outbreaks. many patents guy concerning Coronavirus? conflict interest statement would mile long. Yes, it‚Äôs shown high cycle thresholds could pick virus fragments would enough infectious may also result someone asymptomatic little active virus body. Yeah, Easter 2022 maybe Hoover institute, public policy think tank. Can't fool me, that's kraken lives. million day easily. 

50 million travel, staying dinner many that. 100+ million around travellers sure. go home, picking virus family spreading airports again, normal life keep spreading. like WW1 soldiers spread spanish flu people poor assessing risk. survival rates staggering low considering easily virus catch. couldn‚Äôt care less 99.9% chance survival 0.1 still high risk dying. Ignoring dangers actually longterm damage virus despite surviving.  individual human working together sacrificing personal freedom/happiness

You've answered question. Self-sacrifice comfort strangers entirely foreign concept us. people wearing masks staying home protect themselves, others. literally care all. *Laughs American healthcare worker* I'm danger. feel that's slightly misleading.

Vermont, example, far safer places. Like, looking numbers now, definitely better Hawaii, even numbers growing marking ""hotspot"". still lower numbers Hawaii.

That said, Hawaii large better states, break point. know truthful say ""a lot"" better absolutely every state Word insurance companies trying get covid labeled pre-existing condition get well. employeers liable happens going see future health care claims denied well meaning ip shit creek someone ends health issues covid. site watch? Contagion happy ending though, completely fabricated bullshit nonsense (not really, movie scarily accurate) Human human transmission confirmed 1 week Chinese new year. chinese gov still managed limit (relatively speaking) people travelling from/through Wuhan original estimate 15 mil. fast forward 11 months apparently many people left denial stage. US planning similar timeline. Fauci said April last week. know interesting thing much people said matches people saying now. 

Then shows look forward to. already seeing start annual journey home. know comes next. do? Short physical force can't stop it. meant months sense it‚Äôs short lasting like two-three months. article supports main point getting it‚Äôs probably longer lasting think. comment addressing claim celebrate another day... valid response. Yeah you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre bunch imbeciles nothing better spread potentially life threatening disease instead staying home. Jesus Christ, people ignorant like able live todays Society?? Remember things said media, end true?

Make decisions happen. ye, point comment.

 America managed fuck badly outlasted epicentre pandemic. ears bleed finding timestamp... Exactly this. Leadership's response pandemic feels lot like cull. Thanks. It‚Äôs fascinating read approach. Huh? realize order online grocery stores employees put together order either pickup delivered, without go public area grocery store. case, put bags together overnight store closed restocking. yes, unfortunate reality vast majority us need ""hole home"", can't really exist without grocery stores employees. course get paid more, hopefully $15 minimum wage happen. 

I know systems paying gig employee go shop you, like Uber Eats whatever, Krogers almost everywhere country name another offer contactless pickup. Place order online, come next morning dude loads trunk up, already paid online. think European citizens desire get vaccine suddenly board government initiative? people don‚Äôt want vaccine aren‚Äôt listening government protocols Covid tests used way. quick ones accurate, showing symptoms good chance test negative, although always. ‚ÄúExecutive orders force law..‚Äù

Apparently not. mean article title says ""Russia ready provide countries vaccine"" they're actually ready :) think meant Oceania... Failing that, we're people welcome piss away best years living fear vaccine out, need ready accept rest us won‚Äôt joining. Americans don‚Äôt care fucking thing beyond comfort. Yea, duh, democrats fault. 

/s Vote Progressive, sure do! dumb we.... Darwin winner. It‚Äôs bullshit bro. People giant protests marches months now. trans rights march last week NYC expect believe Thanksgiving Dinner spreader event? Gtfo bullshit. Magafucked  also similar question Maybe we‚Äôre free country don‚Äôt rely communist regime tell us shouldn‚Äôt do. Last time checked adults make informed/educated decisions related health well-being.   Except final testing, manufacturing, distribution... get find effective 95% effective vaccine 50% population bothers get it. What‚Äôs point? jobs bought things can‚Äôt. TIL testing cure! /s brand rule certainly problems, admit single ruling party able quickly effectively deal pandemic major plus.

Sure middle literal Holocaust, least trapped people homes stop virus... could train CNA, certified nurse assistant. Many nursing homes offer certification course free charge. think 2 week course. 300k excess deaths year, far. ""I wear mask day."" like, heart attack eating much McDonald‚Äôs.  
People getting mixed messages. Telling ""You go work Target, go bar. work grocery store come contact hundreds people, visit family. Starbucks super essential also COVID going kill you."" 

Either COVID deadly not. get play sides. yeah people tired this. knowingly spreading disease conspiracy theories

My uncle works warehouse. worked whole pandemic. believe deadly media says forced work whole pandemic. him, like ""If anthrax building, would closed."" one helping stay home. one offering pay bills ""safe."" Thanks Capitalism! Honestly, need hope...where see ending? Indians celebrate thanks giving increase odds someone else catching you? young healthy, make sense go late take risk rather elderly immunocompromised person? That's fucking insane.  haven‚Äôt seen ‚Äúweeks‚Äù ‚Äúfew months (2-3 months)‚Äù article ages.

Edit: meant short months realize children came adults responsibilities, feeding child one



Not schools cow.
Not schools shit.


Never ‚Äúi pay school fees‚Äù ‚Äúi choose school guys wont even feed kid‚Äù hold ground could easily easier pack lunch. well cost school anything, theyd funding hand important less entitled situations :) OK, get now. Thank you. Well that's sportsmanlike people don‚Äôt care. look survival rate decide take chances without realizing effect Hospitals. Car accidents alcohol poisoning much larger risks group COVID. Articles written events newsworthy, statistics easy google search away. thing is, Toronto also hit pretty hard SARS, time learn lessons either, second wave also really rough there.

I think cultural thing. SARS mask wearing became common East Asia, never caught Toronto. not? month-to-month lease? can‚Äôt say people don‚Äôt know science works get mad data ‚Äúhints‚Äù something

Science heavily based observations get comedy comparing US babies whatnot, give em credit due. US Revolutionary war innovative civil rights movement colonialism. bit far cry teenage angst. Fuck instacart shoppers, real. assholes don‚Äôt care observing social distancing, don‚Äôt wear masks properly, don‚Äôt follow flow directions, stands place 5 minutes picking putting back multiple items don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre getting... ugh, drives crazy. BILs tested past 2 weeks close contact, one still waiting results thanksgiving still on. Quote FIL tonight, ""if get it, I'm done"". meant joke god, seen people say shit like die? glove, love! forget like 40C winter people still flock shopping centres malls relief Christmas, also boxing day Christmas shopping here. Yeah, spout bullshit. someone know raped, molested, die carry term, 10 year old raped family member gets pregnant. can't stand pro ""life"" assholes, think holier thou, never desperate, bleak, hopeless situation make hard, heartbreaking, devastating decisions. mention, none give fuck baby born, social programs baby, that's work Satan! fun high horse, looking us baby killing sinners. two weeks give time thoroughly review data. important step something want rush! ""review"" kind formality, actual work occurs meantime guarantee people involved busy. issues raised discussed questions answered interim. 

A good way think might final check go vacation. already packed bags double checked them, fuel car, tires inflated, tickets hand, doors locked etc. take moment right leave double check done everything good go. 

In presentation Whitehouse day stated begin distribution within 24 hours approval already pipeline.  Yep. really annoying many people care others personally impacts them. can't imagine other's close relationships people die. Australia doesn‚Äôt require test travel. quarantine tests arrival. probably won't. mass infections happening grocery stores corporate big box stores anyway? heard peep that...but guy wants open bar small restaurant he's owned last thirty years, good god, no! businesses owned corporate overlords allowed thrive... won‚Äôt vaccine available.

When vaccine trials everyone excited mRNA based, people concerns mRNA vaccines brand new, pointing technically going multiple vaccines available really change peoples concerns. sub.............. I'm public transportation. Pandemic get home see family Thanksgiving. Freaking drive can, least. road trip much better flying right now, example. normal day one thing, much riskier larger amounts people normal. Open private tab There's idiots everywhere.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, likely privileges there. expensive health care world, get stupidity? Can‚Äôt fix stupid. may China thing getting out, it‚Äôs definitely US keeping thing contained. One thing would acknowledge though lot harder first country / region deal new disease like COVID. saying local Wuhan officials good job (they could reacted faster), also faced really tough task.

In beginning, doctors even sure disease (several thought SARS), testing readily available, much less known treatments.

Subsequent countries opportunity (even always take it) learn Wuhan. Yes know this. It‚Äôs top notch authoritarian regime. nice one! Congrats works well guys! Apologies least they're dying see tourists, opposed dying off. worried Joe office hearing happening later Trump regular citizen lot Christmas funerals. 3rd wave? guys still going strong first wave.  I‚Äôll nothing next month least. Thanksgiving it‚Äôs household only. ROC governing body claims right rule China, declare independence (if lose right claim China, another topic). pandemic measures shaped every provinces doing, results similar. Yep. coworkers direct prolonged contact positive case, one guy lost sense smell. Yet showed work ""he negative test"".  Another coworker basically told allowed office said he'd call guys CEO necessary. I‚Äôm traveling immediate family, staying Airbnb, chillin. Might go eat patio restaurant, go beach park, otherwise enjoy quiet time kids. work pet boarding facility although we‚Äôve getting tons bookings Thanksgiving Christmas, getting even cancellations within last week. 

Everyone cancelling mentioned wanting travel covid cases rising, new restrictions, flight cancelled. I‚Äôm truly hoping sign people seeing rise cases deaths deciding traveling, truly nobody all. can't give much credence writer keeps using ""sperm"" ""semen"" interchangeably.  3% US citizens confirmed case Covid 19. Particularly back March/April, lot cases missed. still missed now. 99% people left infected. rate charging population, soon see limits infection, least limits states testing capabilities. ‚ÄúWhy wear mask betas wearing around me‚Äù I'm betting figured they'd travel early beat rush, wait days get tested

i would take bet. fear that's far optimistic. husband 7 deployments years. We‚Äôve celebrated Thanksgiving August. 

It‚Äôs like concept gratitude charity lost people. I‚Äôm worried access. make free don‚Äôt make available parts country, doesn‚Äôt matter give away. need start public health campaign make easy people get it, work, homes, schools homeless shelters. Unless old lady ninja feel like share responsibility safety. get close enough cough you? Dude, start pandemic everyone like ""watch Contagion!"". Fucking shit, scary back then, like ""they must known something"" nailed it. Yep. least 50% country full stupid.

We nation complete fucking morons. Nobody gives shit grandma making extra years, anyone thinks actual government world economies do, they're flat retarded.   Food shelter real needs. artifice social safety net relieves burden (universal healthcare, unemployment benefits). People still need work countries, they've built safety net. Selfishness-as-a-virtue mistake. ! vaccine comes out, everyone common sense get others undergo natural selection.   one wait see daily cases 7 days thanksgiving weekend...

I think going break 300K daily cases. already 187K yesterday? There‚Äôs another movie called Dr. Strangelove. 

You check ending. Or..just watch America‚Äôs response Covid. wanted post Brexit joke realized I'm fed topic. mind. entire country china basically travelled, lunar festivities, try 1 billion chinese, 5 million. cases im sure providing value we're mass nothing able stop it. brothers contact tracers btw. Yes, Americans proven thenselves largely, quite stupid. IFR nowhere near that, come False positives PCR testing pretty rare test look genetic match highly specific virus, kind like paternity test. false positive rate found 0.5% 1.7%. See evil pharmaceutical corporations used gigantic resource pool invent vaccines? Loaded immediately me. Though complain want work yourself. length time takes evidence load make evidence less valid. I'd bet little toe hit 1 million summers end It‚Äôs panel doctors scientists, pretty much read, comprehend, analyze report bring individual assessment. said, data tens gigs, won‚Äôt review raw data. They‚Äôll read analysis prepped Pfizer. !!!  K you‚Äôre stupid. Congrats. Oh wow. Glad getting better.
Ppl need careful Thanksgiving. Asheville actually I‚Äôm going, makes feel better. worries! hard tell Trump lol restaurants barely holding even pandemic broke. Thanksgiving Christmas, think winter brutal Yep. God knows bad month - probably 1 million cases per day. Wait what?! legal???? see AARP‚Äôs website. basically say flying dangerous grocery shopping, not? Guess they‚Äôve got many members God damnit. keep problems. 

I've already lost one person know covid, friends family know across world neighbors die disease too.

This joke. wish people would take seriously. single place. 

I bet could find places would allow locked right too. 

But won‚Äôt, didn‚Äôt then, either. excess deaths us already 300k couple weeks ago. I'd inclined accept excess death count verified covid death count hospital full covid patients someone dies heart attack count covid death too. We're going finish year 500k+ excess deaths, doubt. next year probably vaccine rolls out. Without vaccine probably double more. Lots there, eh? us ignorant selfish. Maybe definitely big enough impose kind restrictions. think it‚Äôll small endemic waves like flu starting next fall. Add vacationers list. I‚Äôm really tired anti-maskers people get shit spreading covid. live seen record tourism year, no, they‚Äôre bunch anti-maskers. Everyone seems justify whatever fuck they‚Äôre they‚Äôre wearing mask, blame anti-maskers. 

People need stay areas. took 10 seconds google it, give try. yourself, enriched feel. super easy boot! city state? really lack sense entitlement, sense entitled self-preservation. Covid found one coworkers days ago. Thanks diligent mask wearing taking precautions, tested negative, despite fact absolutely exposed person infected. feel entitled keep life, health, pursuit happiness. And, interestingly, act logically direction goals, lo behold, protects people around too! Whooooda thunk it? Please post/comment links Discord server. check official Discord server menu tab.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* replying guy replying me. point stands. I‚Äôm trying chastise overzealous bot two fleshbags distracting us. Bot licker. It'll probably end becoming similar getting Heep B shots, happen long time.    least let use reusable bags. They‚Äôve banned reusable bags Chicago.

Same California. solution? ask ‚Äúno bags‚Äù put everything back cart. wheel outside car bag groceries reusable bags car. It‚Äôs difficult make difficult. 

I big-enough pile paper bags earlier months pandemic don‚Äôt want add it. Yup. work dog boarding facility. packed full Thanksgiving. Everyone still traveling coming week.  Proper Covid restricted Wuhan time. Comparing current situation us doesn‚Äôt make sense. hear you.

The fact matter virus dangerous herd immunity achieved. may take time place like USA number reasons end.  Stay course happy within context possible right now.

And mind glad don‚Äôt live place women cover faces time! PANICKING?

WHY PANICKING? Im going visit cousin family state im wearing mask whole time im public wont much begin with. Im anti mask already lots hand sanitzer plane  obtuse abjectively incorrect concepts American exceptionalism blame. Us Americans beaten minds traditions exceptional, therefore better best, matter we're always number one. ridiculous course, deeply ingrained aspect culture. 

""Pull bootstraps."" individualist, self reliant American dream. neoliberal's wet dream - convince people they're best, lavish lifestyle Rockefellers Trumps hard, honest work, simultaneously convincing reason they've succeeded despite tireless efforts, side (the dichotomy two party system) keeping holding back, ""not us, benevolent loving leaders working you.""

The Romans perfected divide et impera war society, Rome fell, Rome always falls. twilight days American Empire, Covid Plague Justinian think. western country legitimately succeeded regards containing covid? counting Australia New Zealand well, they‚Äôre actually east get called western due cultural similarities isn‚Äôt accurate, lockdown started Jan 21st CNY Feb 1st. 100% understand we‚Äôre human everybody makes mistakes sometimes. geniuses speak truly one kind you‚Äôre wrong, massive drop intelligence it‚Äôs truly frightening. that‚Äôs we‚Äôve ended now, pure stupidity. 

I appreciate irregardless joke. lost question meant yourself? island help huge number cases dealt earlier year? hasn‚Äôt reoccurred it‚Äôs simply result island?

Tbh biggest difference far enough resources dedicated contact tracing, public that‚Äôs generally comfortable making sacrifices temporary lockdown long term benefits like freedom attend large events without risk exposure Google Apple monitor location times. data sd third parties tools visualize data.   best US right now. could better obviously still problem right lot better every single state. island help that, able control entry COVID-19 crisis¬†has reached¬†catastrophic¬†levels. White House fixated election challenges strange, ominous shake-ups Defense Department national security agencies, virus control across country‚Äîwith 49 states simultaneously classified hot spots.

[That's every state except Look Maryland COVID app. Pretty close automated, maybe quite level imagining though. Playing devils advocate here. everyone scared getting covid. you‚Äôre going somewhere, like see family know also don‚Äôt care, not? Especially you‚Äôre planning outside particular group. It‚Äôs deadly everyone. Hate say Oh come one day billionaire driving big problem opinion, long meeting like 20 people.

The problem takes 1 2 people airplane could easily spread many people plane. cases low, chance 1 2 people quite low. ramping much odds someone plane Covid probably pretty high. automatic, decently high.


This hypothesizing though. real evidence, sure someone done calculations.

I would say right *the worst* time travel pandemic. 

Although suppose Airplanes sort negative pressure cabin *might* safe, many people waiting airport, would make nervous. feel going be: Vaccine=Ok travel

I'm also curious see could see small black market fake vaccine papers. 

This frustrating part year, nobody knows 100%, wait see :/ ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running room. COVID patients, acute patients well. ask again: patients go, care them?‚Äù Brown said.

They go round round ambulances paramedics desperately call hospitals search beds. literally happening Poland, another rich country stopped managing pandemic, right now. 

Alternatively, countries without staff surplus beds stuff hallways corridors die way Italy, another rich country whose health system collapsed crisis, back spring. 

This endgame country refuses work manage pandemic. door walk through. either stop community spread stops healthcare system.  test positive quarantine 2 weeks - logically negative immune 2 weeks listening podcast day simple math: average death rate roughly 1.5% cases, good rough guess many deaths going come given day look two weeks back number cases day take 1.5% that. numbers almost certainly going shoot like crazy (which happened Canada October Thanksgiving, Toronto area going back March-level lockdowns month later - still recovered went hundred day close 1,500 day).

The final hypothesis podcast that, given conditions, realm possibility could see 2,500 deaths *a day.* 

I know clear everyone students back country. **Stay fuck home year, love god.** woke morning checked coronavirus cases previous day. saw 200,000 cases yesterday, googled ‚Äúare fucked?‚Äù Never starting day like again.  people looked poor people soon join them. 

Can't wait Katrina FEMA subdivision. Looking forward buying shit cheap yard sale. Unlikely. Oh you‚Äôre telling Americans severely retarded?
Who would‚Äôve thought cdc also reported 10 percent country infected around time announced world (which current surge). australia tough example always bring up

they imprisoned citizens refuse trust testing

they almost locked entire state week, including can't go outside walk dog, someone lied contact tracers they've vaccines actually go usual steps, cut bring us quickly, can't every vaccine take approach? Great site takes 14 minutes load [archive link anyone trouble accessing article outbreak wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd much rather continue music festivals general return normality even means hyper vigilant small clusters don‚Äôt get idea Thanksgiving maintained.

For Christmas, even government country releases lockdown doesn‚Äôt want backlash, dad refuse go big family gathering three generations mixed together lot elderly people.

I go see partner zoom / skype / facetime others point that‚Äôs it.

Because we‚Äôre allowed gather doesn‚Äôt mean should.

But ranting about, I‚Äôm talking people country people think wearing mask socialist oppression. Come brag didn‚Äôt you. admit sg problems like everywhere else. it! Many people both. Please understand poverty death sentence millions around world--even US A:  I‚Äôm American watching overseas America seems give massive ‚Äòoh well ‚Äò vibe . People dying ? Oh well , sucks guess . I‚Äôm Australia mass shootings Port Arthur massacre government banned lot guns put restrictions sales others haven‚Äôt massacre since 1996 . I‚Äôm Victoria coming 3 month lockdown cases deaths 23 days . Restrictions work save lives feels like America country accepts deaths part life . aren‚Äôt part life places . America people hate deaths America country doesn‚Äôt seem give shit . It‚Äôs sad go America. 2020 yet.  Gauranteed two things might slow down, testing capacity many sane people are. Every time got bad, states putting restrictions sane people getting scared slowed things down. Utterly ducked There's options ""be considerate fellow man stay home year"" literal communist China. reality people might last months, years, forever. point know OP specifically even said they‚Äôre paying rent. they‚Äôre evicted falling behind payments covid rent protections aren‚Äôt play here.

landlord could easily said ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre month month, X day notice (30-60) lease ends end period‚Äù

edit: op would pay rent end period comment true month month lease would ending regardless also winter vacation planned. 

The infection rate lower here, dont ski, wont go rented small hut alps far everything - even lock speak ;) pull nurse ward (30 beds) leaving understaffed.

I agree sketchy. ER waiting room sight ward desk doors actual ER sight. panic alarms course.

Shit really hits fan call people OT generally 1930 weekdays 2200 Friday Saturday solo shift change 0730.

Such life rural hospital. paper hospital 12 docs. currently 5.5 (one pregnant taking lighter load moment). covid. US currently 12M cases right now. can't wait see number end year. Almost nobody getting vaccinated January theres literally evidence believe anything weather instead peoples behavior feel like we're heading grapes wrath shit now. food bank volunteer basically rotten potato Bank now. Yeah imagine he's considered that... Phoenix? ‚ÄòMURICA. 

*Cough Cough*

‚ÄòMUR - *flatline* context. Also, Simpsons quotes, gifs, videos? like 1-2 Staying home year jammies watching movies. Canceled annual Christmas trip NYC Ballet. Im bummed hey dont worry getting sick killing inlaws... H‚ÄëE‚ÄëB Texas really game curbside everything else. wish rest Texas wasn‚Äôt horribly game. Chances (not valid reason) mom relatives pressuring guilting visit. Older Indian parents take kids unbelievable guilt trips matter age situation Unless get different strain. believe 6 them. 90 days past initial infection point reinfected strain . protests 99 percent survival rate?? surprise South Dakota all... fun! forget mask! Many grandparents going die next month so.
It‚Äôs truly sad would happen. get traveling early Christmas, day two reach days before...but can't think thanksgiving trips planned mostly day of. talking neighbor works medical researcher increase cases state said, ""Oh, think bad? Wait December January. wishing today's numbers."" bit frightening hear. Right? Also, can't forgive movie blonde doctor.!&lt; pretty far-right think tank. Ah. 'entitled' human rights thrown window. disturbing. I‚Äôm gonna I‚Äôve done every year life get flu shot live life. Masks fine now, post vaccine mine going right garbage. 0% chance I‚Äôm wearing shit six months every future year maybe reduce risk popping fever days flu. source? makes room Chinese buy American land American's becoming \[insert\] shut airports again?

Maybe make driving illegal? (temporarily) us risk. sad part, even tried take strict precautions.

By calculations, going pass 500,000 infected daily next Saturday, without accounting Thanksgiving. We're 1 infected per 150 people US. That's roughly 1 person per small suburban neighborhood. Fully expect we'll 1 person infected per suburban block, first week December unless go full lockdown soon. tried welding people homes?  right, rely charity rich people, government fuck all, I'm glad stepping plate, especially zero obligation so. Wait, thought wasn‚Äôt supposed look like *after* Bernie became president. interesting see likely eventual reinfection worse initial infection. Someone keep eye on, since likely access excellent medical care. B cells work makes bit terrified everyone's wearing masks, standing around socializing, risks minimal. Rip  Started watch April stopped. people dont realise fast shit grows.

Ask linked account... look contacts 1st second grade :-/ 

We fairly locked informed 5 contacts fine believe people want that, forced push idk, shop wearing one. understand, hot af hassle. got positive case shop everyone's wearing mask without complaint. think hit little closer home people realize. say least 6 months, 6 months. least means ""this much, more."" data 6 months can't say lasts longer. another month likely see articles saying immunity lasts least 7 months. pictures those? travel work past week 4 airports really strict mask usage.  food court kind areas people eat pretty well spread out. much.  Perfect timing Chinese government's end. Immunity may last months, years!

*Bullshit!*

Coronavirus could lifelong effects!

*SCIENCE!* Ha ha ""cancelled"". Buckle up, friend, Thanksgiving even holiday everyone cares about. still playing football? Ah okay reason. Looks like I'll continuing life, remain locked insde next 2 years. Unlikely contributing lot society case zoom ICU Christmas zoom funeral. I'd say half passed fucked point. even startling realize lot problems response baked American form government. decentralized federalist system privileges states' autonomy distrustful coordinated national action, especially regarding things like public health, safety restrictions civil liberties.

What we're really seeing think, kind natural selection forms government societal organization, governments ""adapted"" deal national health crisis requiring centralized response, not. Thankfully vaccine save america going extinct speak.  Collectively, world banned Americans. Happy Thanksgiving! mom murdered serial killer, may take precautions defend happening another loved one. mom dies flu probably won‚Äôt much avoid flu maybe get flu shot it‚Äôs free. Imagine bad going year healthcare workers leave field. going happen. teachers. can't think one instance people actually ""changed minds"" ""learning hard lesson"" American politics. reality is, worse material existence becomes, entrenched people become dogmatic convictions. fault-- result literally end rope financially, culturally, spiritually etc. We've dealt filthy hand capitalist greed get bed day reciting works us. Blaming working class exercise moral superiority... futility. gotta look up, find real cause suffering. important? Well, important collective reckoning corporate greed engender revolution society. Otherwise, dividing further. could drive, it‚Äôs 2 hour flight vs 15 hours driving. Maybe could ask doctor. [*this data confirmed cases, obviously lot cases ever wave would assume downfall active cases. best we've flattened, never taking bringing in. means nation never control, maybe parts country good one part control whole country potentially compromised. that's dream many people arent going sacrifice mental health greater good simple sometimes. Technically, think lot people would hope you‚Äôre wrong. :) well. 

I hope great night! cite Chinese study? fuck gonna go? country's said fuck travelling abroad. We'll exchange Sweden Dakotas. Life America* Tell it. 2020 thought people sense sarcasm comments inherently batshit crazy. 2020, seems large population believe everything hear read. what's exact phrasing used? individual income, wages, disposable income? True, respectfully humbly took time read message understand viewpoint. time, Government's logic, could everything right go grocery store essentials inadvertently catch COVID guy front me.

To clear, I'm anything reckless. mask, social distance, sanitize. go groceries essentials. home improvement stores, soft play kids, bars, restaurants, clubs, indoor play kids. vacations, beaches, parks.

But Government really thinks I'm going celebrate Thanksgiving immediate family, fuck off. obvious enemy 9/11. really isnt one here. man made China, likely would cared obviously case dont individual/place center anger on.  Yeah, know recognize that, okay upset seeing family christmas posts like ""WhAtS SpEcIaL ChRiStMaS"" purposely obtuse reason people upset this. ran multiple steps simultaneously. don‚Äôt normally high financial risks costs. urgency pandemic overrode financial concerns.

Bottom line - didn‚Äôt cut corners; burned money. got 14lb turkey $4 Food Lion (NC, America)!! Swedish famously stubborn. Also worth noting population US 1918 103 million, compared today‚Äôs 331 million.

(Also trying downplay COVID all, like providing context bad 1918 influenza pandemic was) haven‚Äôt seen parents since week started. brother. friends aside quick hi park. don‚Äôt go restaurants bars anywhere else. life exists inside computer phone. I‚Äôm sick it. miss family much. first time life, I‚Äôll making turkey home. I‚Äôm happy good us. make sad angry see social media posts others getting together, knowing everyone took measures (or least absolute best ability), could maybe better place. areas people get face wearing mask. Everything upside Republicans declare another Trump victory  get organized, yes, would probably way go. diff thread us based attempts fought enough ppl probably potential. However, do/did Walmart open srs first hour, happen supposed fly home Illinois December visit husbands grandfather, turned 90 year. canceled weeks ago, Illinois‚Äô numbers started climbing. We‚Äôre definitely disappointed, it‚Äôs absolutely correct decision. Corona strong seasonal effect, different flu.

The flu almost completely dies summer, Corona still spreads reduced rate. corona flu spread much easily winter. dont understand bullshit though? study done Italians. found covid anti-bodies blood samples CPE- based microneutralization tests done september. missing here? really? one countries history bookended slavery state sanctioned murder unarmed black citizens? She‚Äôs Australian.  hope I'm totally wrong. funny shocks us? 

I remember week 1 became serious US, early numbers mortality 1%.

Quick math head using conservative .5% - turned 1.6 million dead everyone caught it. cut say 1 4 americans get it? 412000 dead.... yeah...none shocking least.

The things really shocked is; badly US response fumbled, US production *actual* PPE still lagged behind. - cloth masks *actual* PPE. I'm looking Korea plentiful KF94s. Yea people gonna make money? Pregnant women excluded trial unlikely approved receive vaccine initial approvals. I'm exhausted disappointed.  also extremely long flight guy fine, good everyone else. Cannot argue proof like this. Happy new year! Finally awful 2020 over! covid! 

All people saying can‚Äôt wait 2020 like calendar date means jack shit going waiting whole lot longer Canada here, Thanksgiving... cases ever. Christmas going crush western world. *we're Closer 1/3rd. 103 million 1918 compared 331 million 2020 8 months ago definitely get vaccine assuming there's reinfection then. They're saying vaccines causing bigger immune response actual disease provide better protection.  I'd rather ask answer, AlexaBlissBooty. Well, Australia huge infrastructure help citizens, $1200 usd thats it. China welded houses shut. advise living there. yeah, people they're supposed world would perfect isn't. MagaKagFucked actually misnomer. got lofty idea align reality. childcare facilities. send kid somewhere 8 hours day, child care facility. covet right vote it‚Äôs sake?

I covet right vote sake, ""covet"" right vote remove peoples' voice take away right express opinion form vote invite nothing violence revolution. option point brutal dictatorship open revolution. It‚Äôs helpful analyze vacuum democracy also responsible rise people like Trump, Mussolini, Hitler.

The fact unironically lump Trump Hitler Mussolini just...I really words it. right head. Trump incompetent leader, shitty human being, level Hitler Mussolini.    Hey don‚Äôt ruin narrative. guess, maybe meant ""Can you"", ""An you"". Comparing city entire nation. logic exactly? ‚ÄúIt joke bro!‚Äù

Yeah, sounds like shitty opinions get exposed. Better luck next time. Good then. Enjoy holiday. saying started Italy traveled Wuhan coughed 80k people infected...........LMFAO PLEASE STOP BS LIES Dems gave gun crusade, they'd start win ""battleground"" states. Biweekly donations check. live Memphis. place huge source pride community. American Exceptionalism acquiring comically tragic different meaning 2020. Lmao no. did, neither company's briefings specify. Go ahead, prove wrong. really matter title's timeline bit off. Chinese New Year lockdown largely cancelled. 5 million people regular-ish travel city lockdown. staff hospitals? Pessimistic thinks Trump signed EO's garner support then-coming election. 

Biden driving force so, he's already proving he's politician (aka liar) else double speak. We, commoners, shark infested waters pieces trash cling to. Sad days coming heels great leap forward cultural revolution, probably made sense. life cheap Mao republicans best. That‚Äôs terrible. Tell millions others know COVID-19 real, thank medical / hospital staff putting lives line help rest us. don‚Äôt know put BS thrown Trump down. sucks even dying COVID-19, still aren‚Äôt taking seriously. 

In times like these, it‚Äôs unfortunate HIPAA. doubters could see doctors nurses see everyday, go thru ‚Äúmight‚Äù change heart. 

I hate callous medical staff pledge help people, might time put dying COVID-19 disbelievers tent let sort details God. Frank Burns stupid I'm almost there! USA go Roma path  Well another 2 weeks 1 25 would infected, 1 13 4 weeks. point people would know enough people terribly sick they'd willingly lock put drastic slowdown virus. California definitely made mistakes, would still like gently point states can't stop interstate travel, matter *how* good individual state's response federal response incompetent shitshow. diabetics covid? feel horrible üò¢ Yup, stay home mask up! taking exam MBA program then, no, same. talking casually around zoom dinner table business practices management strategies then, yeah, enough overlap two using interchangeably generate confused decent, plain-language comparison. high level, JIT focused strictly manufacturing process Lean encompassing whole business process. ways maintain mental health traveling large groups gather Thanksgiving. people travel fine without doubt others get sick family gatherings it‚Äôs likely percentage get seriously ill maybe die. 

We‚Äôve seen family gatherings resulting deaths time time since beginning virus US. know still don‚Äôt good treatment cure. So, yeah, gatherings result deaths family members spread disease even further. capitalist countries good job ones leaning towards socialism.

I'm Australian. accurate.

If pressed, would say Australia NZ significant experience larger scale disaster response emergency management, experience engaging communities part response.

Whereas US history mishandling disaster response, even current administration. look Katrina Puerto Rico Maria. attempted get job contact tracer luck. least yet. state looking volunteers would love time free trying find job. know great deal doctors religious. Wanna guess think virus? 12-year (5 IATSE) stagehand I've already lined apprenticeship another industry. Would love able rig shows make good cash weekends though, can't wait things get back normal. suspend air travel give stimulus cover losses. freedom traveling fundamental constitutional right 5th 14th amendments, it‚Äôs specified right air travel forms. 

This done November 1 ordered Thanksgiving dinner Fred Meyer pick up. me, wife 3 kids. 

It's bad US laws like India, caught wearing mask... 24 hours jail time. questions asked. Correct I'm wrong. work country there. would unfortunate suddenly got sick himself. Damn shame, would be. We've quarantining last 2 week's preparation driving seeing parents. Even still decided cancel safe. can't imagine flying. fly landlord heartless decided end lease even tho paying rent. 

There LOT details missing statement, I'm saying anything bad since need state details make point.

If statement made way I'm taking (and others) probably talk someone make sure landlord steel you. lot people know tenant laws well (because poor education system subject) LOT things landlords can't get away people call out. prob not...I get granular side it. 
But systemwide holistic view...better paid, staffed, supplied nurses would benefit everyone.  culture fail see connection starvation shutdown. need covid relief people like New Orleans needs hurricane relief funds, deal w side effects shut down. Hahahaha gotta calm man, take god damn Xanax, can't understand satire already far gone friend, take care champ. Good luck anger lonesome filled life :( :( :( We‚Äôll clearing ~500K cases per day end December. cases picked disaster testing system; real number far higher. Nope. good old common sense Sounds like still China's fault then. Remind me! 6 months see deaths think that's people affected. There's many people survive ongoing health problems. part new TEA guidelines, school goes virtual uncovered reason, they'll get credit half days virtual, meaning half days made end school year.""

My 1st grader virtual year getting full day credit. use exact lesson plans curriculum rest 1st grade teachers campus, dedicated virtual teacher live day, everyday. happens school goes virtual? get 1/2 credit exact work he‚Äôs year? get leave school year early? teacher forced stay school extension even though requirements/contract met? hell TEA doing??? What's funny people going kill ones care travelling homes loved ones. hope make peace deaths happen. Mitch says economy ramping, stocks great, thus stimulus. article fake news! think I‚Äôm used disappointed this. ‚Äú3 weeks slow spread‚Äù, ‚Äúshould summer‚Äù bullshit, really jaded doubting vaccine early everyone saying. feel bad saying bc it‚Äôs positive. I‚Äôm kinda sick helpless disappointed. Upvoted. Every American family needs celebrate $15 turkey stay fuck home Yep. Store closes 11. go 10 organized list things located store. quickly. point clear success pandemic come government guidance alone. Personal responsibility selflessness makes work. wonder America absolutely fucked; countrymen bunch mental toddlers. It‚Äôs pretty obvious doesn‚Äôt work? people like (general population) never even attempted, say didn‚Äôt work? didn‚Äôt work? ""I preexisting conditions diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, really minor things lot people really count, I'll probably fine catch it!"" total number overseas Chinese \~30 million including millions Singapore Malaysia left Qing Dynasty. source hundreds millions recent emigrants?

source half population less 1000 yuan/month? End Game fucked without go public area grocery store. 

Why think true? see employees carts filling online orders public areas every time shop. think stock back what's floor?

I'm sure places hours filling, way hell that's norm. can't really exist without grocery stores employees. 



I know can't, still making someone else take risk you. Someone making much money. Someone probably wants take cerb, can't. really point wanting people chill out. Now, this, there's way many sanctimonious people bitching anyone going out, able suggesting very, privileged position, part stay home, others putting risk serve you. case, kids remote, one person works outside (seldom closer 10ft), one SAHM, two remote, one grandma. 

So actually possible. probably store manager.

But realize anti-maskers often extremely belligerent also areas rare see walking around proudly carrying guns hip. fair, Adelaide largest possible advantage geography. european country, closing borders far difficult completely eliminating virus also far difficult. least die virgin. Everything we‚Äôve seen far doesn‚Äôt support happening. rely healthcare people family wtf know. agree on. seems behave like CV‚Äôs know of. Bro we're still wave #1 PRC nation since also claim rule China, technically there's civil war? nah I'll pass mask, cheers YUP. decided awhile ago evidence necessary something true. Covid them. say moment get it. mild asthma honestly give shit terms taking extra precautions beyond normal person would, may enough bump vaccine queue slightly. case probably behooves wait groups given chance vaccinated. process elongated refuseniks, yes, certainly happy restrictions extended that. going store, helping keep employees safer. Ofcourse. one wants medical debt. 

Plus I've ordered once. food good due less fresh ingredients since foot traffic declined. ? Kate Winslate? Honestly main characters died. Would proven point disease won‚Äôt stop. bad - meant say ""so... lockdown work, lockdown part deux work, they're making shit up"". Continued government meddling whole thing main contributor spread. may not. Man parents live less mile me, teachers, going cook things everyone planned bring, split trade zoom meal house. concept behind article interesting; authors writing fails clearly convey story. I'd interested reading another version story better writing. I‚Äôm driving two hours see grandmother, bubble since March. got tested last visit, course masked occasions venture out. think it‚Äôs pretty safe. kids full time online they're really happy. They're allowed TV, youtube video games, school hours. think balance would best that's plan asking for. Three days WFH two days office. Best worlds. know many people think 100% one other. September 2021 seems likely time-point starts end

Yesterday Best case scenario, get 60% population vaccinated October 2021. summer going awesome. going last summer. Probably worse actually.

And mods deleted post saying ""Your comment removed because: contribute high-quality information""

My comments saying 8 months things start get back normal downvoted hard. People sub denial. It‚Äôs also possible entirely asymptomatic. mom was. tested negative four times living three covid positive people close contact weeks. 
I‚Äôve going outside socializing far anyone else nigh trying get fam get with...

It‚Äôs like trick avoiding Covid trying get it.

Economically USA major poverty problem. However, richer middle class Europe. large Europeans live urban, rent dwellings, often don‚Äôt cars one small car.

These amongst poorest US states. Look healthcare, salaries staggering. Reddit often say ‚Äúyeah healthcare‚Äù...healthcare family 3 typically $800-$1,000/month-ish. high...but it‚Äôs seen almost like tax. debate could go on, blah blah blah. 

But many teachers Europe aren‚Äôt money retire $480k house 4 acres mountains? many principals live $800k house lake? Doctors make double many areas. blah blah, longer debate. 

My point is...it‚Äôs pro/con.

But European lifestyle isn‚Äôt superior American.

Further study species carry coronaviruses viruses important mitigate outbreaks well limiting human/animal interactions high risk spots. matter bats South America bats China likewise camels Saudi Arabia Iran... pose risks.

That said, look geopolitical blowback finger pointing China removal funding study coronaviruses Wuhan (US pulled funding) feel becomes apparent looking exact origin de facto witch hunt counterproductive science current climate.

Further guarantee future events follow path current virus outbreak (i.e. MERS) learning likely vectors use one specific origin IMO.

**TLDR**; yes need explain knowing whether city vs city B current environment helps prevent emergence Covid 20**27** H1N1 Bird Flu 20**31** results finger pointing reduced funding? I'm studying zoonotic sources (i.e. bats, camels, civets, etc) mechanisms transfer; blame game hinders science. literally said know we're pretty damn well deaths per capita.

Oh see doing, want believe country grossly overstating COVID deaths. going ask felt ""straight dope"" comes care think.

You're mad self-organizing social network bursts bubble want. would love mask enforcement agent, kicking people grocery stores wearing masks. Hell, I'd even minimum wage honestly love going people wearing masks every single time get chance

I gone strangers couple hundred times. No, I've never assaulted way. Mostly get mad stammer walk away. Sometimes try go complain staff, tell put mask get out. Sometimes put masks on. crazy we're literally living abject fear people point even tell people put mask around food buying of...what? think they're gonna pull knife gun fucking wal mart? Get real dude. say mass deaths hoax. die covid always choose lowest death count percentage possible downplay. colored numbers reply. Pfizer said they'll 50 million doses 25 million people. Add vaccine think we're 40 million still wrong. know 250k sounds like lot heart break 500k+ annually heart disease? See post. Username check point wasn‚Äôt due democracy. person overstating it. gamer analogy hilarious. moved away hattiesburg Utah like moved different country altogether. went asian grocery store earlier (which way literally 10-20 times bigger one hattiesburg) literally every single person - couple hundred - wearing masks obviously careful close people. even dicknosing chinstrapping - NONE. like nearly everywhere go. People walking around street alone masks on. Driving around cars masks on. Even riding bikes mountain trails - wearing masks. 

People south mississippi contrast bad say. petrified go anywhere anything hattiesburg everyone knew still posting big maskless group pics friends bars every night week. People BRAGGED wearing masks, made fun people did. 

I know everyone ms quite frankly them. astounding stupid people are, chuds expect be. every demographic, every political affiliation. them.

That's like playing life easy mode cheat codes. wish could US. people selfish hopefully,we nice Chinese New year year.  Give manufacturing consent read sometime really believe people *want* return status quo devastated working class much fascist elected 4 years ago. people vote divorced material interests design, indeed education broader culture best make sure working class can't even *recognize* properly value material interests.

One simple example, media outlets country reach hundreds millions? owned absurdly wealthy whose class interests diametrically opposed spent billions air time attacking candidate posed threat material interests. 

Please make mistake pretending Democrat voters anyone matter immune propaganda, work would ubiquitous society. people *want* we've trained want society built around staggering, unparalleled consumption waste done nothing make us miserable people relative contemporaries absolute terms, much fascist elected. thought already skipped Fourth July, Halloween year. point, we're lined skip entire year worth social holidays, more. 

And think we're agreeing general, Thanksgiving kept people already other's lives, without including people possible. absurd expect people celebrate holiday though, reasonable people keep small practical. J&amp;J actually considering two shot format well. rainy day fund saved day oil &amp; gas goes tits good, mark words. think term self fulfilling prophecy makes sense here. Belief virus increase chances dying... long classify rioting ok think it‚Äôs important empathetic struggling COVID fatigue. However, empathy shouldn‚Äôt turn permission break current guidelines. hope feel mentally well soon, stay strong! service use midterm rentals, something wife also considering.  sure gold? .... commodities  Mask use universally lowers virus' reproduction number. hundred people virus, R0 1.5 without masks 0.9 masks, mask mandate means different ~200 people getting infected vs. entire planet getting infected.

US counties mask mandates dramatically reduced spread compared otherwise similar counties mandates.  won‚Äôt go well. Don‚Äôt count going well.

Edit: mean distribution. Im sure vaccine safe effective need vaccinate children, aren‚Äôt transmission vectors proven multitude studies now. majority 18 vaccinated really need children gone exactly planned it.. look event 201 love idea ‚ÄúChristian persecution,‚Äù absolutely exist majority Christian countries. actually believe martyrs. Absolutely deranged. Freedoom agree you. consider cautious, I'm willing get haircut fine outdoors.

I think fair shame people wearing masks large parties, otherwise, lot shaming seems unwarranted heard tin foil shortages yet, ok. quit alcohol October 2019, thankful time quit pandemic kicked in. gross seeing memes ""wine drunk mom teaching kids,"" not. find funny, sad me.

This pandemic gave everyone chance reset lives. longer drink booze smoke cigarettes. work regularly lift weights. pandemic come better healthier person.

I can't understand people using moment silver lining lives. see people surprised this, proven selfish human man thoughout centuries. History keeps repeating itself. handle packaging port get exposed way. 

Then keep hands away faces wash them.

That's basic pandemic hygiene.

I poll worker/volunteer. Everyone voted handed paper voting pass.

I handled bare hands. care. hands getting anywhere near face washed them. That's immunization works though cause problems others around them, family, health workers, hospitals get put risk people vaccine. need hack hacker hacker  Honestly - it‚Äôs extreme cold makes Moderna Pfizer vaccines difficult put wide spread use. Hospitals, research universities/institutions, big tech/pharma/biotech - sure figure since already cryogenic storage ability track people second dose. suspect Astra Zeneca vaccine soon approved first choice Jansen (J&amp;J) vaccine gets approval. don‚Äôt think one vs two dose part biggest differentiator compared ease transport storage viral vector vaccines have. assuming viral vector vaccines also high efficacy. efficacy much lower different.

BTW: joined (J&amp;J) trial last week. Fingers crossed got vaccine placebo works! far haven‚Äôt ill effects typical vaccine soreness. like regularly remind people UK, first lockdown 40,000 deaths later, UK government adopted ""eat help out"" scheme, government paid half price food eaten restaurants encourage people cram restaurants. 

If ordered takeaway, pay full price. qualify discount sit eat meal close proximity strangers duration meal. Careless indeed.  Lol. know science works? You‚Äôre one claiming it‚Äôs seasonal. It‚Äôs prove it.

Also article April. Scum owned owner Fox News? mountain published research it‚Äôs impossible learn traumatized. wired safety nowhere found, massively regress basic instincts. College hard enough mid ‚Äò00s which, retrospect, easy time alive.

No one remember learned year. they‚Äôll remember hard was, pointless suffer like that. Sarcasm? TL;DR. 
The Swedish public health agency (FHM) implemented 50% face mask recommendations WHO. 

There actually exists recommendation face masks FHM started working came updated recommendations. 

It found covers close interactions caregivers patients like instance dentist‚Äôs office. 

This kind situation believe face masks effective reducing transmission. visors act mechanical barrier reduces risk wearer spreading secretions mouth nose speak, cough sneeze. usually called source control (Swedish expression missing). basic measure staff symptoms, even mild ones, stay home. Although physical distancing works society large, easy maintain staff patients caregivers situations. purpose source control context try reduce risk asymptomatic staff spreading covid-19 patients caregivers working face-to-face. Here, duration work close face also important risk infection transmission. measure probably also means protection wear mouth guard visor, even protection eyes, nose mouth used time caring confirmed covid-19 cases.

This covers first part [WHO 

The second part people usually mean face mask recommendations; use general public. 

They preface recommendation countries recommended use fabric masks/face coverings general public. present time, widespread use masks healthy people community setting yet supported high quality direct scientific evidence potential benefits harms consider.

The FHM instead pushing social distancing measures proved perfectly capable stopping spread spring. Wether work time remains seen. would that?

The reason deny strategy based herd immunity, well documented even Tegnell said back March. think we‚Äôre country, wholeheartedly agree. pandemic I‚Äôve lost job back July, new job person wearing mask. Responsible adults ass lol bet next year see huge increase cancer deaths. People skipping screenings, appointments pushed back. personally seen coworker kept getting mammogram pushed back 6 months, turned cancer breasts. Cousin weird black mole back get derm appointment March. Finally got surgery melanoma last month. uncommon stories.

So damn frustrating see people arguing literal covid deaths there's much misery beyond that. US also hit 10 hurricanes year feel like everyone forgot too. worst hurricane season record, beginning two weeks early running well Greek letters. there's technically week left. tried :) thing pisses I‚Äôve busting ass avoid part problem. Aside asthmatic son, people I‚Äôve concerned (older/overweight friends relatives) don‚Äôt care little protect themselves. 

I keep telling myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm son‚Äù right that‚Äôs thing preventing saying ‚Äúf@ck people don‚Äôt care stop inconveniencing protect them.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm healthy little concern catching fact might give son. he‚Äôs vaccinated everyone else f@ck right off. ended two relationships family members. wonder mass have, virus exposure needed cause infection, ability fight infection varies based physical health. Would tall person extremely physically healthy less likely catch virus short person also physically healthy? matter much disease new assess damage body's organs. Humans studying physiology long time assess pathologies heart, lungs , kidneys organs know wether permanent irregardless cause new. It'll sweep eventually reach saturation point.  No, independent group, decidedly national, unified orientation, ""command"" message. Make WWII reference. dare mention that!!! Even troll, dont think know society works. Ugh, truly disheartening. even medical personnel take seriously, I'm sure say anymore. hope little better environment. DM ever need rant. know us could use friendly ear, least. Agree. HIV high probability turn death sentence yet people still go bare strangers. mindset, people don‚Äôt care. Caring much inconvenience them. ace2 inhibitor, antibodies target virus. possible. seeing similarly unequal distribution? Spring mostly New York. Summer much evenly distributed major metropolitan centers. 

What troublesome people eager sum numbers instead dividing up, population geography. Nah, true. Sweden's results terrible chose stuck terrible strategy. yes, sting actually see many deaths would prevented they'd done competently neighbors. think that's fairly polite way putting it.. Yeah, well, I'm guessing survive cooked.

And washing hands touching raw chicken, fish pork. Yes... adding evidence Tegnell also agreed herd immunity misleading attempt rewrite history. 

Yes. see like line Orwell's *1984:*

We've always war Eastasia. Indeed, go way imagine horrific scenario, horrific.  know couple kids California going college came back WA state holiday.

I know much CERB qualify get giving everyone? wedding reception 55 persons rural Maine town led COVID-19 outbreaks local community, well long-term care facility correctional facility counties. Overall, 177 COVID-19 cases linked event, including seven hospitalizations seven deaths (four hospitalized persons). Investigation revealed noncompliance CDC‚Äôs recommended mitigation measures.

What implications public health practice?

To mitigate transmission, persons avoid large gatherings, practice physical distancing, wear masks, stay home ill, self-quarantine exposure person confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The people died attend wedding. ever thyroid tested? agree getting tested celiac. really see doctor, nothing else establish baseline test results compare older situation ever gets worse. let's remember long two months is

Good god, conversation referenced something couple months ago.

It past Monday. understand excuse leaving home go work pay bills

but virus got control US people wanted protest Wow still voted Orange. way things going especially crazy amount travelers think May everyone still alive US natural antibodies. see way everyone get people place traveling. think masks situation all. Seatbelts primarily protect wearer. Masks also, probably primarily, protect people. consequences using seatbelt mainly born person decided use one; often enough, consequences even include taking place hospital, morgue. consequences person wearing mask arguably mainly born others. see anything wrong leaving something individual's choice individual bears risk. changes fundamentally individual bears risk.  Osterholm Update: COVID-19. weekly go-to source! may sick hearing it. people actually sick dying, suck up. Exactly sigh It‚Äôs end world know it.

I feel fine. far. kind twst getting? Antigen test gives relative security used correctly.

Also, seems rare get shortness breath isolation. Awe sorry.  Im sorry give livelihood, thank right thing mean meme potential, right? spouse gone weekly fresh food smaller fridge I‚Äôm little bit country... Please explain logic dude, please also tell buy whatever drugs you‚Äôre on. Schools suburbs still open said they‚Äôre going remote thanksgiving. assume don‚Äôt trust people make sacrifice distance thanksgiving expect exponential growth cases afterwards. think lot school districts seeing travel, protests curfew california, general behavior people likely come conclusions. question ones it‚Äôs late teachers, staff pupils. Here's website:  It‚Äôs thousands pages data. needs verified peer reviewed. understand want ASAP ASAP. process usually takes months. trials take years. They‚Äôre sitting this, large margin fastest ever done. post say wasn‚Äôt? Reading comprehension, indeed. first 300k doses bought government distributed free govt decides get them. remains seen govt buy doses. dont whatever Regeneron studies showing seasonal? Reasonable experts assume point?

So reason masks working still allow people congregate?

And reason need masks people still congregate even allow people congregate?

Ok... correct. Obama administration still left significant stockpile though, although early parts pandemic chaotic, late November federal government still gauruntee purchase meltblown fabric startups. already late point also. almost beg parents cancel trip Puerto Rico December 26th, even got mom cancel Thanksgiving dinner (I believe invited brother sister, still, absolutely not) I'm opening idea cancelling Christmas (I think brothers sisters, course, absolutely fucking not) saying stuff like ""oh well come Christmas! eat back porch blah blah blah"" I'm going get cancel it, need work slowly.

I want say parents extremely careful take every precaution necessary, never going unless necessities go masks/gloves/sanitizer/the works. honestly think they've enough figured one time holidays couple family members would okay, take risk? vaccine close top it?

It genuinely feels like full time job taking care family keeping informed, idk would happen here. brothers sisters clearly find problem coming holidays, hell would happened moved back year? guess that's glass-half-full way looking moving back in. ü§°ü§°ü§° Makes sense sure. basically, follow rules get hurt. it‚Äôs ridiculous opinion consider communicative properties virus. wonder could contact BOLI? Oh no! Humans enjoying humanity, social animals! disgrace! scary thing watch, look them! seem happy.

Honestly, know take care yourself, stop depending others. health always hands responsibility.

Wear mask, social distance want wont get it. Stop making tragedy others choices wonder many refuse conspiracy. America's credit, insurance, flu shot usually free too.  still option later via different method. refreshing see someone talk sense. Idk people sub viscerally attracted many us suffer hope anymore indefinitely Yea went vacation already Never ever beard, hate even bit stuble.

I dont think anyone saying forever. lose. die anyway. People fucking dumb add, number one place catch covid group gatherings, family visiting family. yeah, Thanksgiving going horrible. enjoy notion taking novel virus known negative outcomes lungs somehow better way inoculation well tested vaccine.  leave country Ive subs show graphic videos people murdered....this place tame, far. ridiculous argument hear time ‚Äúwell, you‚Äôre always call, you‚Äôre getting paid sleep sometimes‚Äù may true, get one glorious night without call several hours, norm. need up, awake alert deal whatever you‚Äôre going walk into.

The ‚Äúperk‚Äù people claim talking profession shift structure. lot EMS 24 hour shifts, allows get ‚Äúfull time‚Äù 2 days make money overtime. 

Uhhh, want exhausted, overworked EMS drive ambulance high speeds another back trying keep someone else alive? Oh, 24 hours straight calls? Tough titties, sleep.

My stepdad, stepbrother brother law EMT/Paramedics well. stepdad 30 years paramedic many years belt, pretty well. Stepbrother brother law cop firefighter respectively. lot EMTs go two fields nursing. It‚Äôs quite dumb think vaccine made quickly carries risk. take time make vaccine, takes resources. government put LOT resources one thing. It‚Äôs dangerous vaccine gone testing validation time it‚Äôs available. talking type socialism? That's MO lol  hit 618K Civil War death total. started, pretty angry Wuhan, it‚Äôs citizens acting fear. see Americans, acting pure stupidity, ignorance, absolute peak narcissism, Wuhan seems like nothing missed opportunity contain reached United Idiots Dumbfuckistan. Would interesting understand prevalence underlying conditions West vs. East much impacts death rates two regions. Look Taiwan, South Korea Vietnam, magic, aggressive Public Health measures. Plus attitude people makes difference.  It‚Äôs beyond time tougher mask mandates kind stay home order. totally hand. already parking lot ‚Äúshack‚Äù ready go im at.... I‚Äôve done thanksgiving alone before. Made Mac cheese biscuits. delicious nice days Same, cancel everything else, give Anime Godzilla opening ceremony. I'm UK can't smug response Covid seem got bit better testing heavily partial lockdown. 

America blowing mind. love States, lived vacation Florida least year. 

It feels like outside people ignoring even happening , lot ppl minimum congratulating it. watched Orlando soccer match today, sure people masks social distancing people really need there? Disney World - I'm sure procedures stringent moment thinking always make journey thing stay home. 

Even SNL audience, why? - little get wait vaccine. really reddit without teenager complaining capitalism. Smells funny. parents live 2000 miles away seen since February probably see next summer earliest. chip means could see Christmas worry every day might never see them, chip F up.

Plus dig vaccine records school next year. chip would hella handy regard Everybody wants live life. people right thing want ones wrong things. 

 everyone wore mask, social distanced, washed hands, leaders actually gave damn instead fighting every step way, whole thing could behind us. 

Those ""refuse live fear"" blame still going on. no. think sad people US self serving shit heads.  cool dude, like it! Nice work. grew military kid, always away extended family. thanksgiving tradition ordering pizza. won‚Äôt year, can‚Äôt eat due sensitive tumtum. otherwise, stay order pizza! tip generously!


Now parents retired, invite friends (still live far rest family) mom cooks turkey that.....it‚Äôs weird. 

Was invited going. Home Xbox snacks are. people breathing aren‚Äôt. Livin like Rockefeller‚Äôs here. 

We $7 Ham. It‚Äôs 7lbs. feed 3 people right? Thanks every confidence they'll work necessary bring cases back down.

This country that's averaging one three deaths per day population 1/6th US. They're willing work hard keep safe. ""Plenty""

Watch name eight. Sure, send mods way. don‚Äôt spend lot time here. I‚Äôd problem so. want alienate family that‚Äôs you. Obviously quarantine didn‚Äôt work first time around, what‚Äôs different time? Yay! I'm Regeneron trial. think still might enrolling despite EUA. pretty sweet deal, get $200 per visit everything went super smooth injections follow-ups. may give shit people do. Lockdowns US bit hypocritical, since problem letting serve ua die first.... start bs. Older vulnerable immediately. That‚Äôs American economy, messaging way 40 years. 

And that's good thing. thee reason people climb Everest run marathons. mean could helping African women instead? Drive expand frontiers much nature empathy towards random African women. problem is, long people suppose make sacrifices, millions cases USA, Australia Asian countries cases. However, still going lockdown again. time USA reach handful cases, sun already used hydrogen.

It take forever USA 5 cases like Australia New Zealand , lock down, everytime new cases remerge, long that's going be? Missouri? Oh no! Two years? even year now. Quarantine minimum 10 days exposure positive test 5 days Monday least Covidtively, we‚Äôre fucked. understand. panic porn sells. Well least existence means easier buy masks rest us. No, one learning anything seems. It‚Äôs quite disheartening. I‚Äôm starting understand worst possible way people 1920s 30 turned away democracy startling ways. It‚Äôs distressing see trend happening now, even worse knowing caught yourself. also would, greater numbers.  spanish flu didn‚Äôt even last ‚Äúyears‚Äù like redditors suggesting coronavirus pandemic going last. problem scale people doing.

He's driving long distance. filling gas? Going public restrooms? highly contagious locations, residuals shared bathrooms.

What gets accident? people road = accidents. accident would mean would need come contact emergency services. car needs get towed, riding stranger. gets injured, hospital, ton potential exposure.

Testing 100%. infected low viral load testing show positive. many countries require testing 2 week quarantine. guarantee people that.

Quarantine: people actually quarantining. They're still going grocery stores/parks/pharmacies. ones apartments taking elevators. That's isolation, quarantine.

Masks 100% unless they're wearing N95 equivalent, changing regularly (and also making sure properly sealed).

Doing ""right"" things decrease risk. problem American culture individualistic culture. everybody says ""what's harm increase risk little enjoy holidays?"" Well, happen lot people die. Lol. Think little. 

Curb side pickup only. serious allow one store. think allow people stores logical basis closing stores. Similar demographics, comorbidity healthcare standards make better comparison.

Anyway, right compare Sweden worst nations world category them. \*have\* Health care workers. 

And, next line (at least state) - 65, anyone jail, smokers, obese. well put. I'm sure problem verifying credentials mod team here. Medical professionals get flair know spreading bullshit. Doubt it, need we're more, he's saying combat pandemic fatigue right now. We're getting stimulus cheques, last 3 months proved need it. vaccines tested people situation? saw word committee thought going bunch senators. 

But nope, bunch [doctors America always nation rebels. we, millennials, golden opportunity stop Nazis national health crisis economic crash. unify heart it. fucking make obey us. really, America ''worse'' position Trumpism. Look North imaginary line border Canada decision's public health made doctor infection rate 10% USA doctors power shut things down. 

I realize America fundamentally different government structure hindsight Virus exploiting fundamental's American define by, self-image self determination Freedom. I'm sitting wondering guys even wasting time comparing fruits want able breathe properly remainder life.  grandfather died COVID grandmother planned 150-person funeral state family pallbearers speakers fucking hot spot. 

I'm convinced thing stops people bullshit actually dying, stops dead person  not. members family mutually agree meet spite possibilities catching virus, nobody else even give fuck let alone right tell can‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs little stat nobody likes hear; there‚Äôs 99%+ chance survive get it. governor Cali meet friends inside restaurant dinner masks, fuck gonna tell can‚Äôt around like minded family members holidays? shit really dangerous tell us POS sitting around damn table, inside restaurant, masks, casually enjoying other‚Äôs company? yeaaaap local hospital considering (not if) cancel elective surgery based projections starting week Thanksgiving. Even it‚Äôs really bad fully expect people go ahead Christmas plans anyway. good job maintaining boundaries. 

Sorry friend acting way. Read article post honestly can't help feel experts others like Bill Gates saying ""summer pretty normal"" bolster compliance fatigue right now. coming people eating bat made up?  Trump lost buh byeeee. Omg hey guys, it‚Äôs Tom Brady! going blackest Christmas ever. took 8 months get quarter million. Thanksgiving kill number Christmas morning.

Hospitals northwest Arkansas (for example) taking lot COVID patients SW Missouri NE Oklahoma - states without mask orders.  


This condemnation hospitals - roles reversed Arkansas mask orders, we'd exporting OK MO.   


Ideally, course, would even need mask orders - people would realize ethical duty empathetic need take precautions. Caring well-being fellow Americans become decidedly un-American thing do. tbh think arrogance contributes situation too. Earlier year Asian countries quarantine masks, US government told ppl ‚Äúmasks harm good‚Äù. kinda shocked many people actually believed listened. Wearing mask NYC subway made look like fool. Probably thinking, ‚ÄúChina India lying‚Äù. Okay boss, here‚Äôs 35 million doses. Last five 2 hours away. Yes technically log 400,000 positives per day current capacity can‚Äôt _accurately track_ 400,000 positives.

If ever get 400,000 confirmed positives 1.4 million tests, means true number positives way more. underestimation starts get really bad positivity rate gets percent. No, Trumpism attitude enough impact. absolute, nothing dealing populace.  read something time travellers clicked are. gonna major sports leagues like NBA NFL thats gonna get general population.

Yes. see look recent South Australian reaction Covid leaked hotel quarantine there. saw 17 cases one day announced week-long lockdown. Things better originally thought able start lifting restrictions three days. think one case today, yesterday zero.

I think learnt lot Victoria's lockdown. earlier it, shorter be. think learnt lot NSW approach well. keep cases low need lockdown all. country lockdown since original panic start year. think Australians happy approach we've decided take.

Australia's case different US. Australia disease that's present community, leaking hotel quarantine occasionally, spread quickly out. US disease widespread. makes sense Australia would take stronger measures maintain status quo, pay great. Wait what? allowed travel? going? definitely rounding corner. birthday December 3rd.

It actually reads like something ""Ken M"". definitely South Park Futurama feel multiple unrelated, nonsensical plot threads coming together end really convoluted punch line. really drank koolaid there, go China see good people speak. Oh wait can't government can't contain covid like China can. one‚Äôs tough one! biggest risk see situation one may still infectious, even though you‚Äôre feeling better; cases, people tested positive weeks months seemed recover. Presumably, physician thought clearing return work, though.

I think risk family indeed quite low - reinfections certainly possible really rare (and hoping true much want vaccines effective!)

But risk really hard measure. live together came directly home, packing lunch stopping gas bathroom masked extra cautious, marginal extra risk area fire probably huge issue - risk someone family still infectious.

If coming separate households I‚Äôd much, much concerned. Testing 3 days prior still leaves plenty room uncertainty late breaking infections, four could also risk spreading amongst themselves. don‚Äôt live one roof, DEFINITELY call off.

Nobody tell gathering safe, you‚Äôre effectively situation four vaccinated people meeting four unvaccinated ones live together, little less insane eight people separate households gathering. risk lingering infection family road trip.

Would it? No, I‚Äôd probably call Zoom - there‚Äôs definitely still risk. negligent levels risk? four young folks 50 single household, comorbidities, commit quarantining 10 days returning home, everyone cautious visit - I‚Äôve certainly heard far crazier plans. case, looks much like forming ‚Äúpod‚Äù risk perspective.

Q: interviews Contagion 2011, said experts consulted told world overdue major pandemic. surprised flat-footed United States seems caught this?

A: ÔªøYes. stayed touch consultants movie, became friends lot them. Whenever spoke them, told concerned fact current administration made decision cut funding CDC disband pandemic preparedness team Homeland Security. Donald Trump Republican Party made choice leave country vulnerable exactly kind situation. wait two weeks see numbers. 5 million people traveled within Wuhan early 2020 New Year Holiday. 

50 million people expected travel within USA next 5 days. sounds like agree herd immunity strategy. Claiming never case attempting misleading attempt rewrite history. Every passenger see work affect more. used to, I'm watching selfish idiots empty heart. Sure buddy. insensitive, feel people things like this, darwinism work. family plan including wife child. actually looked commenting. pay $460 month. includes dental vision. 

If go hospital, still pay deductible met. close Canada anyway? Hehe. Perhaps. pretty sad get basic rules, ""just read heard make true."" Trying counter leads backfire effect. tried tell partner ""only thousand people died COVID, people die things put COVID death certificate even though died heart attack."" course started ""I saw facebook.""

Trying counter lead doubling down, tripling down, getting mad us. lol. (We speaker phone her). sister got covid couple weeks ago (she‚Äôs teacher), she‚Äôs going stores don‚Äôt curbside pickup us. fact closing bars restaurants significant impact community spread tells personal responsibility good community health measure. People selfish ""it happen me"" mentality. suppose waste ICU resources them. Looks like next half year going wake call USA. Yes, believe Zenz (the main proponent nonsense claims concentration camps) apocalyptic cult follower waiting destruction Israel end times prophecy. believe much nonsense country (usa)? Honestly, China literally old money rich erased Xi. current China build last decades West quite frankly simply dormant ignorant impact. Truly frightening.

I recommend especially PBS documentary China: Power Prosperity Youtube topic. West starting behind game  agree extreme ""by book"" response, family determine risk threshold is. government extend realm private property, individual owner sovereign. honestly know that? one ventilator two patients needed it, else equal, I'm using patient calling virus hoax. guess flip coin would 'humane'.

These cases far between, usually considered false positives. Stop type misinformation. What's point? Virgin Libya vs Chad Chad Personal responsibility works actions impact you. definitely along lines I've thinking. currently working remotely EXPECT called back I'm vaccinated, boss little unpredictable. I'm trying save much possible point, calls back, I'm going, point would almost assuredly fire me. Absent finding another remote job, I'd wait out. 

And bankrupted hospital bills. even worse scenario would getting sick, maybe even hospitalized, never actually getting well, like many finding struggling long term fatigue, cognitive issues, breathing issues, pain, etc. point literally can't work anymore all. then, anyone take care you, financially otherwise? airline pilot absolutely wrong. Depends many factors: location, number households, much everyone distanced, etc. Anyone would need information answer question.

The risk incredibly different United States versus New Zealand, example. Every time want say something nasty, look users profile usually end feeling bad stop. Good luck bud. HAHA wow can't imagine getting angry this, arrogant enough act authority something that's completely speculative.

It makes seem like generally frightened person, ruled fear. channel fear anger. sad!

The cases CA December believed community spread, means present CA since November least -- maybe earlier.

A quick search online, find maybe studies showing since 2000, population Wuhan 40 - 50% migrant workers. 

So really, unless leaders know something specific telling us -- idea thing started Wuhan -- could early spring summer 2019.

I grew parent ""only"" punched walls threw things. Even toddler felt like walk eggshells around them. tell sick fear would psychotic moment. Punching walls absolutely abuse treated such. think idea keep relevant. people forget pandemic vaccine becomes widely available, many people die. way prevent people going back old ways. people refused wear masks continued going public events. rocket science. I'm curious considered uncivil, expressing desire people stop using incorrect term. think needs unified leadership well. opinion pieces random people saying masks don‚Äôt really work maybe see families. need unified message ‚Äúthis help neighbors, family, countrymen‚Äù stay f home!

Good hope able get sooner Yes that's unemployment, different stimulus check pandemic. US got one $1,200 payment. Canada $2,000/month. get unemployment benefits file unemployment. We‚Äôre 4 times now.

Pfizer plans use dry ice shippjng containers vaccines, containers refilled. 

It‚Äôs logistical difficulty, one derail whole program. may however effect particular vaccine used. I‚Äôm explaining airport traveling.

But course, possibility low-level community spread. hints Europe weeks well. mean.. case think heard recently co-worker's niece's volleyball game half people audience got infected. tracked women's bathroom pretty much everyone tested positive women. Try putting guy room similar size bet infects way 4 18 hours. look one downvoted posts past days, pretty easy get it, extent. family states find annoying wearing masks public too. guess what? simple thing do, feigning ""fatigue"" healthcare workers wear N95s day incredibly disrespectful. too. silver lining, suppose, become easy tell someone bad person simply knowing vote. Common sense tell respiratory virus akin flu would've done rounds really long time ago. nice knowing you, lads believe there's also concern way people talk breathe, possibly structure throat, affects extent spread virus.

Essentially, two people may exactly things, one spread virus spreads like measles, latter sheds particles virus.

I'm sure whether conclusively proven, something discussed lot people seem know they're talking about. Another reason pessimist always best mindset. spouse enjoys grocery shopping, prefer going in. am.

Powerful read know else doesn‚Äôt get go eat families? Soldiers. Police officers. Doctors. EMS Fire. Nurses. 

Huh? people eat families. think don't?

Even deployed soldiers come home deployment eat families. bc FONSTITTUON!!!! FEEEEEDUUMMMMBB!!!! can't learn history? get single person say ""yes"" ask ""Can pay soybeans?"" yes, soybeans would currency.

I guarantee get lot people say ""Yes"" ask ""Can pay gold?""

Both items face value well. like value dollar changes day day, gold soybeans.

If look perspective, currencies commodities bought sold such. acceptance commodity payment makes currency.

Bitcoin, example. intrinsically worthless commodity sand, except value people place upon scarcity. Like gold. Queueing theory engineer here. way. Data March (when using extremely limited number known-defective cdc tests) really directly comparable data September. two things consider.  

- percent positive rate astronomically higher.  NY, NJ, CA probably FAR cases reflected public data, starting like Feb. True total infection counts probably drastically skewed high population coastal states, much data shows. 

- treatment covid19 still figured NYC getting walloped. people make hospital much likely die today, sometimes simple things like laid stomach instead back. 

Imo kind presentation data beneficial public health. People immediately want manipulate scoring points ""their team"": person originally created website clearly agenda. Thank you!! Even Trump attempts coup remotely successful, resulting sudden power vacuum probably result Trump‚Äôs underlings find dagger back. He‚Äôll likely deposed someone competent, though necessarily less vile. ""For 99.6% survival rate, destroying economy destroying peoples lives things go along it,"" Hayhoe said. 

* 3% covid cases currently result death. number go healthcare system maximum capacity doctors nurses wore out, getting sick, quitting.
* known many cases go undetected know true death rate. Even , optimistic believing random sample studies, think mortality around 0.6%.
* amount asymptomatic cases, regardless percent( though 50% generally assumed) , alarming right. people spread covid days without even knowing it. 
* 2018-2019 flu season CDC estimates 34,200 people succumb flu. 262,000 Americans died Covid year yet. figure deaths deaths Covid kill 10x people year flu 2018-2018 flu season. Covid half many confirmed infections. someone says ""but covid asymptomatic!"", estimated 50% flu carriers asymptomatic get 50% asymptomatic assumption covid. Lastly, Covid invade population spread whereas flu already established. took nearly first half year reach majority America. 

So 10x people die Covid flu flu established whereas covid took months fully spread area covered flu statistic. also measures slow spread flu. distancing mask wearing. vaccine stop getting becoming carrier. logically assume logical mortality rate Covid given well rooted population least 10x mortality rate flu would likely 20x already established population. 

Without partial mitigation measures put place, mortality rate would mostly likely increase 30-40x flu. would due infections deadly strains virus. August six strains virus. deadly strains die kill host spread. virus evolves kill host also survive spread. Mitigation measures helped cause virus evolve less deadly harder detect( mild) forms. 

Best case scenario figure 1% mortality rate based flu comparison. reality virus 2 4% mortality rate observed mortality rate( 3%)

* Finally 10% Covid positive cases develop ""Long Covid"", lingering symptoms even organ damage. resolve months initial infection leaves body, permanent scars disease. 

Covid # 3 kill people US right now. flu bottom top list, makes list. Covid flu infectious diseases list. diseases ""catch"" others. makes mortality rates even serious diseases spread population like wildfire infecting reinfecting...unlike top two killers: heart disease cancer. 

There thousands deaths year people go Sturgis. guy. person kills people willful ignorance greed. Businesses rebuilt, people can't. might like "" Well people die every day"" mother, brother, daughter say goodbye someone gave covid. death could prevented little caring people little less selfish greed. 

Do right thing take virus seriously, might month laying ICU( lucky enough find open bed), breathing tube shoved throat feeling like death could come moment. wont feel callous little mortality rate. state? Good! Take gene pool. Help us make better tomorrow. Also, could mandatory law. forget business put business expense. Best way eliminate demand product. Fastest way legislation that's going create black market. sustainable way cultural shift people want wearing clothing made animal parts. going much easier convince young people old people already them. Remember kinds things extremely fashion back today's old people young people. 

Once convince young people fashionable, wait old people die. market dry suppliers go business, likely they'll switch different product. Clearly meant fall of... Another year! Yeah... didn‚Äôt win, didn‚Äôt spend. rate cases per day (which increase) everyone infected 4-5 years want give Bezos money.  always say hope nice time, said really hoped, I'd get banned sub. :3  Thanks.

Just much emphasis getting soon CoVID19 control. Remember New York City jersey fire back March April like ‚Äúwhoa holy shit fuck‚Äù CVS giving free without insurance  maybe that‚Äôs core difference: I‚Äôve afraid contracting virus. afraid spreading Let traveling idiots die. Less idiots country, better long run future generation. Lol friends family also part problem traveling time  Please treat them!! guarantee they're mostly believers ""PERSO√ëUNAL RESPNOBILTIY!!!"" need see consequences actions! Damn, US going get smashed Christmas. FREE everybody. quit. take it. 

I'm EMT supervisors basically asking drenched covid everyday make buck.


I drew line got dispatched call skilled nursing facility urgent 911 respiratory distress.


Not woman breathing completely normally, vitals stable covid positive.


This nursing home wanted taken ER ""evaluated"" told need go ER.


She needed gone normal circumstance let alone covid staff wanted us expose bunch people process taking ER. 


I explained huge unnecessary risk patient need immediate medical attention. 


Then nursing home explained real reason wanted go. new protocols place performing CPR covid patients. patients family DNR paperwork order woman arguing it.


The nursing staff worried woman would croak would mess family (who prickly bunch). Somewhat understandable guess, I'm business taking people hospital may may future need go.


I explained staff became upset said control coming medical director (physician legally responsible patients there) whos site.


I say call up, want hear say woman alert, conscious, normal vial signs needs urgently go ER. 


He says wants evaluated, ask going evaluate haven't. know covid, that's already established.


I told willing expose ER staff sake paperwork headache. 


The medical director pissed knew knew fucked was, wanted acknowledge it.



My supervisor called. reamed job accepting call. 


""Cool, quit.""


I drove back base never went back.


I'm much happier now. Hahahahaha You‚Äôre right, agree tell mom multiple times 1 year, 1 time. got pretty like *it's like happen every year mom..*. still acted like end Thanksgiving. Yes. tell make listen. always get deserve.

I like nothing better everyone stays home, wear mask, keep bar close. know mask debate goes. Even grocery stores masks required, wearing correctly (not covering nose).

Hence, avoiding go ... nothing else .. except may complaining reddit *not* effective strategy. Ok. Residents, Interns, fellows shafted.

But also somewhat protected worst worst.  Yes no.

Yes, preexisting condition would make catching COVID comorbidity, definition (i.e.: one ailment)

No, specific obesity, post seems read.

""Related to"" sort awkward term use case. Strictly speaking, obese relate comorbidites, default state 1 condition rather 0 conditions (though obese tends cause set problems, get comorbidity count rolling, let's set aside now). reasoning, sort illness condition takes perfectly healthy condition ""related to"" comorbidities, even two conditions nothing other.

To use extreme example, ADHD catch COVID, technically comorbidities (two medical conditions existing simultaneously), even though absolutely nothing other. sign Look hospital charity programs. state, 400% poverty rate bill waived. Yup western countries control, even second spikes. We‚Äôve fucked day 1 people want equate wearing mask oppressed. Exactly ones partying aren‚Äôt ones dying nothing Darwinian this. almost always comes back could weeks months, everyone different. Soon, there's gonna thing South Florida. Selfish fucks main game expansion pack? :P (Talking ‚ÄúJumanji 3: Next Level‚Äù) crazy. visiting parents year, far risky them. Note bit said ""can occur"" ""severe case"". course someone develops fibrosis that's issue contradict said, assess damage know permanent? young people get get severe case.  Moderns stored kind refrigeration available hospitals. Pfizer needs ultracold storage. Well...yes also hostile Republican congress refused pass proposed budgets included pandemic funding. Instead got basically 6 years continuing resolutions based previous spending levels fun 10% across board sequestration cuts GOP inserted they're ""fiscal conservatives"".


So yes, Obama Administration replace really want to. CCP approves message. Well look government....it's hard us keep giving shit Whatabout whatabout......


Thousands people sharing champagne bottles vs. hundred (who close contact anyway). Exactly I‚Äôm sure. business. human nature. Humans forget things infrequent lives. Look average millennial lives today compared depression era / world war 2 era grandparent. Business merely reflects human behavior. Covid everyone!!! Give trump vaccine! bleach chaser!  make worse South Dakota Wis Minnesota hospitals longer helping cases. mention anyone car accident receive level care would case count went moon. Early year totally thought everything would fine Halloween, favorite holiday.

Fucking shit. really care load foreigners unhappy Swedes wearing masks.

Really? keep coming threads? People die regardless whether choose stay home go out. California now. Links?? believe vaccines believe anything coming operation warp speed Sounds cool. I'm jealous people live another country months, work allow that. Plus, cats, want move three months even possible. Give Vaccine run economists

Please show Western countries rushing implement carbon taxes, progressive consumption taxes, negative income taxee, land value taxes, free trade across world, abolish corporate taxes, etc. trump went golfing. Working call center example particularly skilled, get sit day computer. Simple right? washout rate enormous, people seem realize mentally taxing yelled day long problems create often helpless resolve.

Even fix customer's issue, they're still pissed call significant number callers treat like garbage. Management timing quickly handle issues end call survey results, need meet spec both. Callers pen, can't find credit card, want chatty weather bring handle time down. ""Hang on, I've got call line"" fuck!

Meanwhile last guy talked like answer even though accurate clicked ""not helpful"" survey email lost bonus week.

You get one types jobs GED basic computer literacy, often full-time benefits. Whether make 90 days another matter. gods save working collections calls. Biden something student debt doubt simply erased (and is, that's necessarily solution *current* students).

It likely graduated plan forgive debt time. one-time debt relief meaningless, anyway. fix underlying issues we'll find back time. Fl positive test rate 20% right DeSatan fudging numbers. second wave hit Dec/Jan. Stay closed long like .

The virus already mutated , it‚Äôs going come back .. 

You can‚Äôt stay closed forever . real world real world variables perfect lab setting.

The patients trial real world, confined lab past months. Could please explain mean? population 331 million... less people dying. People like love fear want control others. Fact people don‚Äôt care fake pandemic results this, really going start showing, shocking numbers 2-3 weeks,, unreal!! Mortgage freezes, job keeper grants government. You‚Äôre underestimating many people are. 

You‚Äôre also forgetting reckless part population drives reckless actions. Lots lots people staying home super careful. It‚Äôs relatively hard spread tens millions people matter reckless sub portion population Swedish people still humans trained medical professionals. People often follow recommendations well restrictions, restrictions make people handle masks properly either. First like ""hey, I'm gullible! thought going another hilarious machine translation fail smugly laugh about!"" like ""yup.... still gullible"". $2 small jobs ok. handling dead bodies covid.  Yeah, can't lockdown without paying people stay home. countries taken approach great results. course, need functioning government that. Great job Mr President! plain stupidity delusion.  Perhaps like drug screening, COVID-19 vaccines become requirement commence employment. Maybe much job WFH. Imagine first world country trillions dollars spent military, weaker less developed nations virus. seems like there‚Äôs point investing military want bring America, instead invest virus research troll farms. I‚Äôm surprised enemies didn‚Äôt sooner. Everyone thinks they're center universe that's exactly they've told entire life. 

40 years exploiting everyone's latent narcissism political financial profit can't undone. utter nonsense, written way makes clear clue writing. 

All evidence points long-lasting permanent cardiovascular lung issues. go away. brag lack neutrality, born Russia. optimistically doomed. :-D like outrage fatigue. spent months right thing pissed hell people following basic instructions I'm exhausted give many fucks peoples ignorance stupidity Im traveling thanksgiving see fam haven‚Äôt seen since Covid-19. happens Lots people CoVID19 deny it, it‚Äôs super prevalent actually.

Transmission occur homes, clearly you‚Äôre going get trespassed home.

But people avoid mingling others homes, police absolutely fine anyone won‚Äôt wear mask private business whatever trespassing fine is.

We beyond hoping Americans right thing. BFF pregnant right know it‚Äôs scary her. try stay really upbeat positive definitely follow science what‚Äôs going infection rates hospitalizations. It‚Äôs crazy time PCR tests false negative rate 30%. Even worse 'pull shoot belly' birth control. Would use condom leaky? Well there‚Äôs fine line sitting home forever living life trying take precautions. 

If want basement dweller next decades choice , . 

Don‚Äôt expect rest us stop living gave fear . ask mortician YouTuber Caitlin Daughtery good video earlier pandemic. corpses well corpses actively coughing aresolizing virus high worry catching dead. live St. Pete havent heard thing Clearwater 10 miles away.

I'm fucking frustrated. I've started simply delete them. people die(maybe one them).......they care anyone may infect!!! side told so. think people forget plane full people, breathing recirculated air name plane ? ...... Air coffin 1. ( Rip) Can‚Äôt worse White House super-spreader events. It‚Äôs like wasted millions dollars testing everyone get wrecked Rose Garden. buddy post 4+ comments hour like 10 hours day. exact person talking about. parting like California Governer medical staff. One worst parts knowing people actually believe this. Hell, still keep trying think good rebuttal would make people stop cold shut faces lives. Negatives reported slowly positives, really. I'm pretty sure he'd knowingly take vaccine rare serious side effects, theory would save lives overall. disagree nobody coerced take something much uncertainty. think people deaths doorstep quiet die alone? 

Ok. judged? They're endangering themselves, they're risking everyone else. spreading coronavirus, filling hospitals burning healthcare workers otherwise treatable issues/emergencies much likely fatal. Plus, longer coronavirus thing goes on, longer economy (for normal people, people invested stock market) suffers. risk acceptable individuals decide worth not? Also providing financial support bar encourages open creating situation.  Actually did. articles interviews. used corona Viruses analogies. haven't. I've never financially stable enough dare enter medical system willingly. make enough survive, nothing extra. tough reality, is..

I curious test was, suppose that's hole get dig today. know people downvoting you. Envy ugly. simply PR problems away.

It's think solve problems PR, give shit use PR make people vote anyway, almost regardless much fuck up. Family harder proximity, I‚Äôm open finding work another city state distance barricade.

I‚Äôve learned I‚Äôm alone respecting science research. No, cases spiking world. People Switzerland surrounding countries don‚Äôt want lock wear masks either. US issue, it‚Äôs happening everywhere. Dude... we've gotten it. locked made sure citizens means without losing house. cases went stayed long time we've slowly opening since then.

We're starting get hit second wave we're closing things hot spots again. 

Trust me, we're aware much danger we're Americans coming across border, that's closed months, stay closed. part sentence says don‚Äôt believe OP already staying home? fact, wording ‚Äústay‚Äù actually implies think is, since telling stay implies ‚Äúcontinue already are.‚Äù

Reading comprehension, indeed. ever considered following advice? sick older people. know last trip around sun. asking do.

Seems like answer shut die alone. besides fact guy, Anders Nystedt, part FHM set national strategies.

You're right. He's infection control doctor one regions... know, regions FHM says actually responsibility decentralised nature Swedish government....

I wonder different view ""strategy""? understand FHM saying? FHM saying something private regional authorities saying public? pictures look like exactly racks dead mink Denmark culled. Yeah likely started Italy somewhere around Italy, China, research read. Means 1 100 die. like odds?

It's lifetime risk dying traffic. Sheriff announced won‚Äôt enforce city CentralCal. Yeah, went Costco, everyone‚Äôs moving slow, rushing, walking past other--and EVERYONE wearing mask. 

As going in, employee telling guy wear mask. guy all, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still OUTSIDE‚Äù gave employee lip, raised mask went in. said employee, ‚ÄúThank you. guy‚Äôs asshole.‚Äù employee thanked said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say customers.‚Äù wanted efforts publicly acknowledged asshole‚Äôs actions. ever anything USA absolutely retarded? bitcoin widely accpeted currency CFTC, classified bitcoin commodity September 2015.

Be well &amp; great, sabe masked possible.social distance, elbow greetings wash, wash, wash hands. Fauchi said today airplanes save time airport lines many unmasked bad. However also said family gathering worst proven worst event avoid. Cases equal people. Cases count test 1 person takes 3 tests makes 3 cases. Steinbeck never said that. actual quote America Americans ""I guess trouble didn‚Äôt self-admitted proletarians. Everyone temporarily embarrassed capitalist."" criticizing fellow self-proclaimed Communists, American citizens whole. Almost dangerous putting workers danger covid cesspool. get saying tho Wow. Thought one experiencing this. It‚Äôs whole family.  look ‚Äúdeer headlights ‚Äú look. wonder ask ‚Äúam idiot‚Äù worrying things?
I family members literally don‚Äôt know anything beyond neighborhood block I'll say over. Zoom replacement social contact. thst case one would ever travel see family. Often people actually feel depressed isolated seeing family zoom. Yeah shut up. I‚Äôm pissed, people like causing whole thing. need learn shut listen, speculation million people died. wasn‚Äôt pissed before, now, shut wear mask. far 12 million PCR confirmed active infections. actually different number, probably 5-10x estimates. didnt know talking Pfizer too.

But yeah there's part government involvement. think there's reason call 'private' there's also reason call 'public'. calling manufacture private since really government US holding bag money, directing labs manufacturing process all. also choose call distribution 'private', Pfizer's people ones getting trucks distribution plans ready. I'm sure there's government person rubber stamping it. 'vaccine czar' somewhere making decisions -- yet!

You wrote ""Our health minister organizing vaccination centers"", that's something I've heard happening US, I'm thinking there's difference. definitely caveat dont actually know. I'm going said know US process far. Really though. can‚Äôt enforce risk tolerance minority majority. people age range, threat deaths despair statistically higher. can‚Äôt ignore science. agree you, personal cost-benefit analysis wouldn‚Äôt put bar, ok people feeling differently it. mouth, I'm sad say maybe glad say loud asshole Wal-Mart yesterday, well 12 year old chin diaper two others dick noses. wanted scream..you're reason never get this! Oh spoiler alert, saying miss one thanksgiving.. um pollyannas Dude know. absolutely could believe it. around time started looking another job. heard vaccines..... drive traffic know this. I'm USA. Back April/May time frame, one neighbors, someone I've never met before, live 2-3 streets over, would kid draw ""motivational"" pictures, they'd walk around neighborhood stuffing people's mailboxes them. small child, understand draw pictures probably kept kid entertained stuck home, going walk good exercise. 

But I, neighbors, included part circle contagion, included ours. 

Some people stupid. anyone comments article? looks like Oregon misreporting number *it‚Äôs going lead sad Christmas lot people*

Given vast majority people age 60 recovers COVID week so, be. know, know, start talking 300k dead COVID, people would either impacted they'd dismiss person dying family extremely old frail anyway. mother trying strongarm going Texas California guilt tripping hard haven‚Äôt seen since February.

They‚Äôre taking precautions still numbers damn high I‚Äôm scared hurt girlfriend family here, I‚Äôd never forgive myself.

I‚Äôve thought driving honestly hope issue travel ban make easier control. I've defacto alone years. weird people can't suck year two dozens people talk Zoom/Snapchat/whatever. like using mouthwash vs drinking 12 pack. exposure toxic substance never zero. sub awful. baby July. God scary. keep telling hang another 6 months  military experts *logistics* absolutely everything else. Anyone says otherwise badly misinformed.

And someone briefly worked fortune 50 medical supply company, flu vaccine distribution mess capitalism misaligned incentives. flu vaccine definitely model distributing covid vaccines. Shit tough hear. people cry Pre existing conditions low death rate. Like people pre existing conditions deserve die. time people live many years virus in.   abuser always blame, lockdown response virus makes harder victims leave, especially lost job cut family friends support networks. Thank internet stranger. frustrating patients co workers talking bunch bullshit still going like everything normal. would get shit co workers still wearing mask shield lab patients. seems like ever one gave fuck. Interesting, wasn‚Äôt brought thread all. Please reveal information August November us commoners. pretty good evidence even 200k/day catching small portion total cases still going undetected. Last number saw catching 1/6. 

At 1.2 million plus per day, 12 million confirmed roughly 70 million actual infections already.. yeah, could get population year Sounds familiar to: COVID COVID COVID - that‚Äôs talks about. 

*Tests positive 5 days later*

*shocked pikachu face* fearmongers truly cared people‚Äôs safety, would support lockdowns every flu season, killed tens thousands even vaccine.

But don‚Äôt support that, they? Pretty sure golden rule can't die, certainly choose ignore society's detriment. feel guilty going see mom Texas Florida places. seen 5 years, could quite possibly last thanksgiving. I'm breaking rules apologize everyone there. True, we're still looking months see change. They're essentially siege USA KSA. foreign powers actively trying topple Iranian government, surprise able respond efficiently COVID.

Iranians communitarian outlook life, though. Tested positive past Wednesday. fever it‚Äôs gone now. tell smell/taste ever come back? :( nose stuffy may miss tasting food LOL. not, honorary kid. :) breaks heart see wonderful country (not province) bullied extent, also many people defending China's stance spouting objectively false facts. There's usually reasoning yeah, ignoring probably best option, haha. makes angry foreigner, can't imagine feels wife. Exactly - remember 3-4 week lag two doses IIRC weeks someone fully immune. Point great, we've got probably two months starts making difference. Well keeping Thanksgiving tradition. Killing innocent people diseases immunity to. Trying get teacher contract joke. looking back August. district like reason give leaving, state board sanction license year. Less issue plan re-enter teaching, still potentially tell employers state license sanctioned, look great you... ALSO, test positive covid symptoms expected work. 

jesus christ. Morons. Maybe lies?! Bynum stating ""tremendous honor"" hold Trumps rally Tulsa. Lol. far many people positions power understand enough science care enough listen experts. mean, look way US treating virus, many states even mask mandates. pretty sure reading comprehension ain't thing.
fuck off. Germans recieving $7,326 monthly

Uhhhhhhh 7k then? Idk got number getting here. Yeah well looks like works doesn‚Äôt it? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidence goes it. got backwards. 

He still privy information aren‚Äôt, likely knew even got sick. explains he‚Äôs talking it. 

It‚Äôs secret can‚Äôt keep anything important himself. needs share world he‚Äôs smart powerful. Otherwise might forget (that‚Äôs smart powerful is). 

If remdesivir got approved emergency use would different story. also, damage healthcare system years come.

These people replaceable whim. 


Don't ever let people responsible forget here. Shouldn‚Äôt it?  paying employees run Navy. need see well make informed hiring decisions next election. oh ok lol, well makes way sense...those ""/s"" marks make difference I‚Äôm curious quickly would reduce projected fatalities, flatten curve Friend caught - fever 2 days lost sense taste one day. There's telling viral load body react. 

I can't sit armchair doctor, ***but I've read***, reinfection rare, totally impossible. whole thing vaccine catching antibodies much memory cells. come contact virus again, body fires memory cells/antibodies fight it. Sometimes memory cells fast enough virus gets through. hand, sometimes viral load experience (when it) high enough trigger antibodies. first reinfection happened summer everyone freaked out? Doctors found individual very, mild case trigger enough antibodies fight second time. 

So answer question - idk. gotta comfortable doing. virus beating mean stripping mask going every grocery store bar. still need wear mask respect others reinfection still possible (although rare). BUT... there's people caught returning lives so.... comfortable doing? smart. **Antibodies excuse anti-mask.** least right now. safe. smart. reckless. Wishing family speedy recovery Rural communities devastated. Example, middle Nebraska county, one large hospital 5 ICU beds. services around 65k people. outbreak area kill way people simply don‚Äôt effective capacity treatment. That‚Äôs tornado. Welp, sucks them. would thinking nursing students would want least jeopardize others, especially patients. telling says -- either way point same, mean 40 million people vaccinated end year. disregarding whims individualists emphasizing greater good. Extremely strict lockdowns. $15 cheap turkey? I'm Australia, we'd pay $8 aud chicken. get safe want be.

Not go work five days week. think we‚Äôve learned anything whole ordeal could help us prevent future pandemics? strengthened defenses? fear we‚Äôll come better came it. pandemic much deadlier including children young adults would still seeing looney anti-maskers anti-mitigation fools? next pandemic much worse covid screwed we? need pour trillions dollars pandemic preparedness.   Tragedy commons 101. follow rules, better. break rules, slightly better overall slightly worse. Everyone else thought idea though dipshits. Forty-seven percent voters saw four years signed another four. group, 80 percent willing completely overturn democratic process give preferred candidate election. We're failed state. I'm sure focus set millionaires becoming millionaire. us striving millionaires, we're striving successful. Becoming millionaire would certainly successful, it'd set family even greater opportunities, need millions dollars consider successful. need good work ethic achieve best. That's success. see people like Jeff Bezos took little online book shop massive online retailer. Good him! 

How'd it? worked ass solved problem. People pay problem solvers. That's see it. 

Don't problem, problem solver. Find solution problem, work it, market others. Invest future. 

Alternatively, demand capital people successful earn it. Argh! Republicans !!!! whole thing absolute failure every direction.  wife, daughter, tested positive. don‚Äôt luxury able work home. 1 year old luckily doesn‚Äôt symptoms, wife uncomfortably feverish every waking moment. shit joke. 

Stay fuck home. I'm sorry situation. I'm healthcare worker really hurts hear people professions treated expendable. bad enough normal times, another level crazy. hurts literally would take avoid much suffering everybody little considerate other, apparently that's way much ask. hope things turn around soon. Elbow bump internet stranger Omg USA Solid statistics Right, we're still talking bit road -- start delivering vaccines (I've heard mid-to-late December) people still need two doses, spaced 3 4 weeks apart (depending vaccine).

So lets say optimistically first batch 20 million people immune late January - that's still enough time 50,000 100,000 deaths.

Not saying downer, vaccines amazing revolutionary.  stressing still need vigilant months see improvement. let's remember long two months - February imagine living like even weeks. move planet? think I'm human. like bars even non-pandemic times. That‚Äôs bad response. cocktail first treatment market actually real affect virus people. You‚Äôre response basically: it‚Äôs available enough downvote it.

People who‚Äôs immune systems compromised won‚Äôt benefit vaccine answer. Yeah, that's scary realization. go USA #1 lmaooo  Thank you. need tourism as, unfortunately, economy. However, prior covid test within 72 hrs crazy! know calling 72 hr quarantine another test 48-72hrs post arrival. No..no ""dent"" hopefully slow control population. 

But population whole different class refuse teach moment. Catch mood whole discussion natural population control, past pandemics, mass die offs, natural disaster, natural selection. today. 

Today Sunday funday. Also known house cleaning day black box wine. Idiots understand society put much importance fucking dates. like family gathering reunion July hopefully, died vaccines distributed? Wtf people eager put loved ones risk?? 

I much family left small, low key(just parents 1 sibling)Thanksgivings Christmases past decade nothing really different me. end world can't see cousins, uncles, aunts grandparents one freaking holiday. People spoiled entitled. best, context, 'least damaging' ""Boy, 2020 sure good year lost 3,094 homes, like 24,000 lost 2038"" Happy birthday, glorious person. problem see people understand even they‚Äôre isolating, see people going social. Eventually gets point say ‚Äúfuck it, it‚Äôs spreading spreading without might well see loved ones‚Äù multiply sentiment hundreds thousands people. Probably near death experiences feeling surprise disbelief. Funnily enough, there's one country world that's close stereotype, would China.

True, there's another stereotype actually fits united states, stereotype country there's health insurance everybody believe poor deserve die. always got impression sick days generally increased spread Covid US. Note I'm talking specifically US though, US health insurance stricter work laws. Kansas, thing People can't take accountability money coming household live fear losing everything fault own. particular insight economics delivering vaccines, retail markup tends around 100%. Moderna selling vaccine $25 wholesale, surprised cost $50 $150 get shot local pharmacy. Huh? Mozambique 123 deaths, no, they're actually worse. But.. countries still letting americans in? isolate shitshow. parents traveling us Thanksgiving, nervous tbh. trying everything stay safe. us them, gloves actual medical masks shields airport, taking mask anything there. landlord end lease. lease ended. right fair, 133k really large. Even India 7 billion people, per capita would still astronomical compared to, say, Vietnam. obvious 133k number would imply really high per capita deaths (from perspective) matter country. Yes. get N95 mask you‚Äôll likely fine know spreading kill others... care. rocky balboa mean, need pay maintain hospitals maximum capacity staff working non-stop, able mitigate loss (since COVID cases apparently give enough money), sacrifices made keep moving. definitely good enough. also start taking melatonin not. Lucky Covid work Christmas Well, that's cool guess. I'd guess wrong percentage considering state country right now. never made claim. refuted claim evidence happened. play lotto time time mere fact chances would born time, location, planet, human, ect... many things left chance, buy ticket every often? I'm spending good portion income gambling, either lottery otherwise, would say problem. reality care anyone themselves. spread disease someone else dies person dies hospital, sight, mind. truly abhorrent mindset. people even care local communities let alone national global well being. Geez thought unlucky Oh sure, that's everybody's best interest. Considering never closed flu pre-covid, moral right suddenly implement new set moralities entirely arbitrary. found interesting book 1918 

Journal Boston Society Civil disease begins decline every one gets careless, I'm afraid shall pay penalty. keep research keeps coming like big news it‚Äôs something known said people still don‚Äôt get there‚Äôs probably like 5 research projects focusing thing type this. waste effin money time ""culturally eastern"" even thing?

Do Iran, Nigeria Cambodia anything common except Western? No. 

I'm tired enemies science clue they're writing thinking opinion relevant. isn't. Wishful thinking science.

So posted study 60% recovered COVID patients fibrosis. go find study counters go away. forecasts coming independent scientists scientists working Pfizer companies? never trusted airline studies can‚Äôt get Covid plane. 

I‚Äôm anti-vax means, don‚Äôt trust company says they‚Äôre going fix everything see happen. see contradiction doubting Pfizer-paid scientists trusting independent scientists, especially since estimates contradict based forecasts (which always imprecise) anything definitive (like experiment). spread now

Always üî´üë©‚ÄçüöÄ  rememember nazi's heart.... thing.  CDC (and WHO) flip flopped stances many times based political motivations even worth talking about.

The question is, actual *evidence* show? public chose switch administrations, voting current administration citing coronavirus important issue. overwhelming percentage independent voters voted change leadership, well. People voted vote. 

It *is* pretty funny think implications conflating college-aged, impulse-driven behaviors societal norms entire voting public, though. Remember everyone, reported deaths fucky republican states attempting hide/downplay/ignore Covid. excess deaths baseline.

When annual influenza wave hits, grandmas broken hips femurs falling ice get treated (leading hemorrhage, infection), that's numbers REALLY climb. really Hoo, right? Poor me. Everyone trying useless seems really defeatist touchy decided Take allowed

Please lie us condescending, rude, judgemental insulting. exactly vaccine hope ever getting virus control. many people either stupid selfish needed protect others. different holiday season might people taken virus seriously beginning. WOW. 

The sky blue. - since we‚Äôre stating obvious. someone say........zombies???  Speaking hospital workers, reading articles, taking information multiple sources. first lockdown little happened outside first two weeks flattening curve. absolutely good reason new one now. pandemics do, use limited rna space spread more. Killing host beneficial reproduction. close lowest deaths per day count yet depending area, highest cases been. Common sense doesn‚Äôt mean people going care. 

If polled people across U.S., would bet 90% people would give right answer supposed do. doesn‚Äôt mean people actually care. socialize education health care.

It's quite easy snap finger. agree that's long term solution, huge economic machines place disrupted changes. Ultimately disruptions impact people, need make sure people taken care of, too.

We also need put safeguards place existing healthcare/education infrastructure that's grifting American people chance grift American people government. Otherwise, nothing fundamentally away war machine scrutinize government works many countries definitely work us.

Unfortunately works countries rely existence American war machine. ugly seemingly unnecessary American war machine seems, primary reason we've relative global peace almost century. retraction American footprint allow Chinese footprint expand -- still leader like Hu Jintao, I'd say huge problem. Jintao, Winnie Nazi, expansion military footprint Xi charge bad everyone involved. Healthcare Canada totally free, long pay taxes. signed delivery every week. outside walking dog several weeks. wish people part. First came anti-vaxers, speak out‚Äî

Thanksgiving hand..... silver lining kept sane since reopenings began. \*insert enron scandel\* Tbh word exponential wildly misused sub.

It‚Äôs every HEB entire state. minutes. curbside delivery occasionally run something. wearing kn95 surgical mask it... doubt never know. Well ways risk taking behavior exactly sent us moon.

Going moon incredibly dangerous high risk failure also based entirely technology developed lob missiles across planet vaporize several hundred thousand enemies once.

Risk taking integral human advancement.

Sadly, cases like pandemics leads widespread tragedy death. Tbh best way discourage would play expensive trip could be. Crash car snowy conditions thousand miles home? would add Proof brains don‚Äôt necessarily matter. Interestingly, CDC's official stance face masks work drastically reduce transmission risk. predict we'll still seeing people write, ""they died Corona, from..."". Next week start seeing people numbers went 1k per day 8k per day. Take care too. Covid corpses probably cremated. backlog bodies Italy crematoriums shut down. Many bodies take twice long cremate.  remember, China's fault!

&amp;#x200B;

/s  seems many people area go understand it. Ontario keep hearing people's older relatives heading Florida winter regardless age preexisting health conditions. People super stubborn. enjoy Christmas deal NHS overload total lockdown new year hmm.

So people going risk losing family Christmas great idea. Band Played On. I'm medical worker.

Your ""choice"" means 16 hour shifts mine, multiple dead colleagues several months long dibilitation.

These ""choices"" literally killing us. spreads disese faster means people overall one given point.

So like revile people make choice go get drunk driving home smashing sidewalk full people, revile people help spread easily preventable disease us take basic fucking steps prevent it.

Herd immunity always combination behaviour, immune status environmental conditions, even measles, outbreaks intense contacts showed. hate camping equipment.

Lots self absorbed. quarantine/isolation fatigue. some, think, feel like may last time see certain family members way virus going. article posted reddit day said planning big get togethers also plan several small funerals. chilling. would love play lottery game 99.95% chance winning, sounds awesome. people sub stop reading positive news vaccines March lol? Genuinely asking we‚Äôre aware experts saying vaccinations starting spring, many commenters saying won‚Äôt 2022 isn‚Äôt based anything doomerism reading comment grok caught eye. knew remember where. go check, thanks sending memory lane.

Have great day. PPE shortages

How fuck 8 months *still* PPE shortages?!? lack coordination national scale produce essential PPE disgusting - nation vast resources wealth chosing treat like crisis is. didn‚Äôt say hope eradicate it. first sentence literally said chances eradicating zero.

Yeah, f\*\*k too, Sun Sentinel.

That's guarded way saying ""No, comply GDPR we're blatantly selling data third parties."" Correction: people thinking. 
 Thought picture. Yeah article partially speculation. It‚Äôs ballpark number. person who‚Äôs getting triggered you, didn‚Äôt add anything article except calling someone child responded you. think shows you‚Äôre child yet try act like adult ‚Äúproving‚Äù blatant non-existent points. Next time don‚Äôt agree it, research put number think go say, ‚ÄúI think article high number low numbers‚Äù instead saying whole thing made fear whatever. article isn‚Äôt misleading saying ‚Äúyeah lots people going travel, many think‚Äù Go camping. Completely exposure free. Last time went brought battery, projector, speakers watched horror movies woods. great. Oh, yes. definitely one west-end counties getting hit hard!! scared fellow yoopers (Now troll, born raised there) surrounding states overrun. Really Duluth Green Bay people go get higher-level care, longer going option soon. Stop hyperbole. Everybody bar likely die drunk driver Covid. I‚Äôm like....guess don‚Äôt want kill people‚Äôs grandparents?

Not going lie really bothers isn‚Äôt enough people days. People dying others part.

That enough anybody regardless whether they‚Äôre *your* grandparents not. Thankfully place didn‚Äôt lay anyone off, repurposed them. PACU nurses shadow us icu.  It‚Äôs possible. Canada right it‚Äôs hard get flu vaccine. It‚Äôs month still, government many months knowing flu vaccine would popular year still couldn‚Äôt meet demand. shipping insulated dry-ice filled containers size carry-on suitcase. handling requirements, like dry-ice top times opened twice day properly handled keep weeks.

The Ebola vaccine requirement, transported dry ice canisters freezer boxes motorbike dirt roads. Maybe learn DRC's example.

And forget, doses become available gradually, hundreds millions available day one. I'm embarrassed American. need keep scientific/practical understanding advancing rapidly. Also area hit really hard, guess really safe lot stores people, even masked up, whereas low rates relatively normal activity resume. need alter behavior depending current danger level, either massive hermit know much think do. get general sentiment time time woudl chance getting approved 

This sorta sums dysfunction neoliberal political system. Almost go hand-in-hand hmm Full morons Dakotas believe it‚Äôs hoax. wish would decency decline treatment. oh majority people homeless relying government. may well call fascist/communist orwellian regime someone eat two right away settled one, we'd know different kind thinking people. Differences good useful; they're best way get information. still think banking Coronavirus vaccine. Florida? Probably Yeah,,, it‚Äôs one holiday season away family. really worth all? decided I‚Äôm aunt , grandparents over. old. aunt remission cancer. grandma health issues. could go life knew holidays got sick died.... could imagine?

Nah, stupid, too. going see family, meaning could infect strangers along way, could infect family, claim love. turkey mashed potatoes worth grandparents lives? selfish, short-sighted, stupid repost bad Well, they‚Äôre alive next holiday season, travel see new grave marker relatives died last holiday season.  People became complacent government 2 weeks late last lockdown. education minister also refused accept schools aid transmission fought closure end. It‚Äôs important politburo China downplayed epidemic long enough, possibly much longer think given acknowledged virus December 31 later downplayed human human transmission weeks, they‚Äôre trying somehow get truthfully blamed ignorant ill intentioned.

 even first infected Hubei, doesn‚Äôt matter came Beijing, Tokyo Singapore, fact outbreak started Hubei there‚Äôs way many infected short time getting dead bat meat single market. Congratulations, learned fundamentals politics 101: control population.

The judicial system routinely fails. point beginning seem system considering entire comment talking situation physical intimidation saying ""may"" mean someone needs anger management. Didn‚Äôt say would April? Didn‚Äôt say 15 people would die? Give fucking break. calling economically disadvantaged people idiots? Generalizations like make look like idiot. /s all, exactly this. Ok apologies Hmm guess I‚Äôll start going earlier know sin Jewish faith something make Jews look bad. don‚Äôt think ‚Äúfine‚Äù quite accurate. would want help anyway? ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs reckless whatever want get someone else bail us out‚Äù American mindset many I'm tempted Christmas. live hundred miles away parents usually visit twice year - summer Christmas stay week two time. cancelled summer trip back gotten nerve tell Christmas happening either. 

My parents conservative Republicans believe Trump greatest, mainstream media liars, virus highly exaggerated make Trump look bad. I'm thinking lying saying either coworker tested positive excuse stay home. that‚Äôs called talking saying nothing. Chinese government brainwashes people liking ripping poverty putting shackles middle-class lifestyle.

So sickening devious. people China don‚Äôt know bad it. Makes glad I'm introvert. could hardly care less going out. pets, games, guitar, house/yardwork do. still go ride bicycle hit hiking trails hours. really really miss bowling shooting pool bars, though. Huh? people go grocery store get stamp too? likely catch Covid airline. According recent Harvard Except puncturing lung embalming potential aerosolize virus. sure they're they've tested more. really think numbers reported traced really warrants article. Outdoor events risky many people think. There's what, 6 people tested positive attended home games year way prove got game activity 2 weeks since got infected. like 2000 cases traced home game, would probably buy outrage more.

 Thanks! work home issue idea, like though. might straight up. grandmother understanding, mom thinking emotions ever since moved back Texas we‚Äôve separated.

I miss think sense temporary field land mines (a physical visible threat compared visible effect Corona) get her: would still try crossing?

I wouldn‚Äôt I‚Äôd call anybody tried instead waiting bit cure sight irrational. prone instead back actually one important treatment realizations early on: staying back puts much pressure lungs simple thing helps ton people Thank understanding selfish. Us high riskers appreciate it. vaccine that's 95% effective, get vaccine worry anti vax people much. people unable take vaccine need everyone get it. OK perhaps ""restrictions"" wrong word take meaning enforced mitigations.  
Let's say ""effective mitigations"" (such distancing) effective people want it. caught result body weakened covid. still dont understand far bad. problem Ba dum. cha really want see mom Christmas fly, recommend flying day Christmas cuz likely cheaper less crowded. #MAGAFucked last 9 months shown American trait grit exceptionalism, it‚Äôs selfishness greed. start charging people manslaughter failing follow guidelines? point bring Nukes? Good them. 2022 elections, claiming virus control Biden took office.

Shit, they're claiming NOW. Confirmed. Fl hospital worker here. average nightly er wait around 5-6 hours. far held steady, I'm uncertain change coming weeks. public gyms Sweden? Old people dying really fucking fast though don‚Äôt want positive news seems. I‚Äôve heard first doses going December likely widely available spring. Dang! Awesome! military distribute? logistics ? military it? Anyone willing explain? :) reason people much trouble losing weight. Like... get there‚Äôs range outcomes somewhere death 100% fine right? scarring lungs indicative that. caught still responsible got hard even though I‚Äôm young healthy. friend‚Äôs dad hospitalized weeks dumb ass went bar watch football game. thing isn‚Äôt comparable seasonal flus. Hospitals across country nearing capacity, capacity places. Hospital employees across country facing ptsd burnout we‚Äôve still got months ahead. guess fuck people severely affecting- selfish fucks really *need* go get drunk around whole bunch people.

I legitimately hope catch recover lifelong side effects, understand fucking ignorant say doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs 99.9% survivable. I'm similar situation best friend. wedding last week lo behold, it, bride, majority bridesmaids, mother bride, stepmother bride, mother groom, sister groom, one groomsmen. Thankfully I'm negative, I'm still quarantine case. like, take virus exponentially seriously straight Covid-deniers, obviously take seriously enough go wedding pandemic, mention enforcing sort mask wearing. one handful people wore mask entire venue. leads someone's death know think. Fuck... I'm sorry man. hope get healthy lucky #TrompVirus Floridiots Right? internships dried up, finding carrier-type work difficult. Instead work ‚Äòessential‚Äô worker retail risking covid health insurance pay might eventually cover doctor bills. Disheartening. That's also reason field hospitals built Wuhan (way back January/February), isolate covid patients families everyone else. live someone practically guaranteed transmission catch it. Jesus christ never reproduce spread level stupid genepool. I‚Äôm guessing don‚Äôt know vaccines are? 
Again, someone job, wouldn‚Äôt expect understand. it‚Äôs real, consequential. Telling people way beat stay home unsustainable. It‚Äôs akin abstinence-only education: people going lie order satisfy natural urges. Tests don‚Äôt lie. 
Think places like schools colleges, people allowed socialize provided regularly tested masks groups. Turns there‚Äôs way fewer outbreaks, places teachers kids getting it, getting community people aren‚Äôt supervised all. 
My argument let people socialize controlled, supervised, test-monitored situations (NOT FUCKING BARS MANSIONS) rest us, including artists events people hospitality workers parents chance survive. don‚Äôt agree ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è reality Cremation services maybe urn makers Everything bigger Texas.

I would probably start living life whatever way makes happiest like everyone else doing. know (just moved Oregon), went WinCo, picked small turkey money voided check out. I'm perfectly happy free small turkey though. literally said things video. Man cult wild see.  Yeah sobering hear childhood stories one friends polio couldn‚Äôt keep kids another friend got mumps became infertile. People forget quickly bad vaccines. clear never learned critical thinking skills; otherwise would understand correcting instead doubling wrong superpower sign weakness. 

Society failed you; failed society. 

But late, hope learn better person remainder existence. do, existence never matter. called hypocrite liar. Nice numbers ya got champ care show work? Maybe Asians better natural resistance COVID.  


That would interesting scientific question ask, sub science, hysteria, politics, self-righteous finger-wagging. Movement restrictions within country, even temporarily, constitutions many countries understand correctly (at least, mine). Even emergency country would probably need year make legal. Possibly even whole election cycle. course advice moving within country, putting roadblocks (like e.g. Finland around Helsinki) work countries. might work next time countries adjust laws, good, I'm also glad countries throw constitutions window pandemic. crises too, times act hindrance times prevents bad actor staging coup. fucking liquor license case do. Anyone purposefully goes guidelines stop spread spreads around denied hospital bed/care save deserve it. don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs like negligent homicide keep gathering parties goddamn global pandemic. Right I‚Äôm stuck ‚Äúlet die, natural selection cull idiots‚Äù ‚Äúnot everyone stay home right now, can‚Äôt stay home get covid, dumbasses ones taking hospital beds them‚Äù.   I‚Äôm high horse. I‚Äôm able see family parents grandmother high risk. isn‚Äôt chance hell would travel potentially get sick infect them. It‚Äôs worth risk me. risk exacerbated hospitals filling way visit vaccine.

Edit add: People infect family members. die long term effects. family isn‚Äôt going us avoid it. could known. someone warned us...  logical, educated, non-brainwashed people are. 50% country living life like nothing's happening. Middle class 100k. 

You saving 20k statically outlier. behind us til vaccine widely distributed. Anyone says otherwise isnt realistic understand ""frightening""......? Idiocy. medical professionals vaccinated end December, vulnerable populations getting time. 

Just lunacy say said. Double amount day Thanksgiving busiest get many least driving. Flying going airport right nuts Using total cases terrible indicator USA much larger country. arent even top 10 deaths per capita. outcome illnesses ever, nothing new. Life unintended hard consequences. Get parents basement. see clickbait articles called ""The failure Swedens herd immunity strategy"" look context. Again, weeks/months won‚Äôt guarantee anything Long Term, time tell  trump blame Europe‚Äôs spike? Except spread people chance death spread people spread people higher chance death. Generally spreading bad. think Florida‚Äôs deaths per capita climbing much? Hell yeah BROTHER Another comparison point could North Dakota: 2.3 cases Covid per hundred people, population density 9.7/mi.^2

There's good geographic/demographic excuse poorly United States doing. IIRC Moderna one could survive 2 3 months normal freezing temperatures too. Sweden's handling (or handling) pandemic horrendous.

What misinformation talking about? live here. confirm gonna worse. Tldr Australia heaven compare normal? soon immediate family vaccinated I‚Äôm taking anymore precautions, shouldn‚Äôt let anti-vaxxers hold us back. still widely agreed patient zero wuhan China? new information take blame China wet market, exotic animal eating culture there?   Jesus christ... Exactly this. string holidays gatherings (Halloween, election, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years) time allow incubation periods shedding makes winter sort equivalent chain explosions. We're seeing first deaths Halloween infections. time get end month, we'll around 9/11 per day. would surprised we're north 5k day end year. We're going hit half fucking million deaths virus end 2020, so...shutter windows, fucking tornado. person responded never criticized vaccine rollout plan. point article gives arguably best-case scenario little detail accomplished. It‚Äôs already shut don‚Äôt fly stay home doesnt affect mental health, doesnt mean thsts true others. Remember reddit used complain selfish entitled boomers were, claim millennials zoomers much caring considerate would never like boomers? Yeah I'm starting see now. kind weird people throw new evidence Legitimately issue finding TP morning grocery shopping. Started Costco, sold out, goto Target get it. 

Such odd thing. 1%, 10%. One ten people infected Covid-19 long-lasting symptoms affecting heart, lung, kidney brain. One five diagnosed depression, anxiety, insomnia within 90 days. ones die, ones live. Hey... Article: Love thy neighbor OP facetious. Welp, I'm going weld home hibernate winter. See March. million dead.

Doctors nurses pleading people something overwhelmed.

And guy thinks it‚Äôs real?

So crazy. logic Wernher von Braun Jewish workers building V2 rockets slaves Germans taking care them. Irresponsible article. making reader sympathize idiots. Stop gathering, fucking morons. one acting like death sentence bar. Most, everyone, well aware disease affects older/immune compromised people. one arguing that.

It's upsetting see people would go bars complete disregard people they're indirectly affecting. death rate low hits goldilocks mortality rate it'll spread many people kill people overall viruses seen. That's fucking point people seem missing argue ""low mortality rate"" I‚Äôd rather take -1 save someone -1,000.

It's worked great civilization far thousands years. all, pay taxes. twitch exists. High priority people getting shots December. fair, type person would bring mask go packed bar right now. I'd question logic person willing go bar also heeding basic medical guidelines like mask use. get sick possibly die rest us go back normal hope right. alternative see rational/educated get ignorant/selfish resulting latter getting killed huge numbers leaving society better (survival fittest basically). really want happen due havoc would cause everyhone. Funny, that. similar stance taken stock market regulation? Leave companies devices, they'll right greater good since crashing economy long-term best interest? stock market crash 1929 came about?

It's almost though, left devices, individuals corporations make recklessly selfish decisions ***even spite*** obvious detrimental effects community whole!!! This. internet creates thought bubbles. FIL freaking Colin Kapernick kneeling somehow doesn‚Äôt care climate change sitting inside due poor air quality wild fires. historically, they've tested vaccines children third world compensated parents. Ethically, questionable best. Maybe will, maybe won't.

But people spread might. mostly parties, indoor gatherings driving spread, yes. ones getting sick grocery run. shutting bars restaurants low hanging fruit. state ever told people stop social gatherings PRIVATE homes, we've already reached autocracy. Good thing law enforcement knows fragile Rubicon  affect mental health, I‚Äôm still cause there‚Äôs fucking pandemic. I'm betting 500,000 new cases day end year. ^(maybe end month) See: abstinence education conservative areas.
What fuck other. 
Yeah ok to?
But that's relevant, established fucking other. Enforcement easy, sad thing necessary. Citizens forced stay home isolate infected. hear medical recommendations based reality filling hospitals. question enforce public health guidelines fight already lost.

Its amazing fast we've seen first vaccines tested hopefully hold scrutiny. meantime, expect store owners, politicians, law enforcement able enforce guidelines people want listen. already feel ""WELL ACHTUALLY"" coming.

Well actually, it?

Do mandate populace side this? translating state power?

Do need convince people agree problem first? convince people anything?

What smallest changes make right now, make biggest improvements? fully embrace conclusion 
that Donald Trump awful president guilty undermining public health messages, stretch blame chaos Europe.

How many governments - left right - managed mishandle monumentally? many ordinary people reject basic measures would keep virus control?

I'm writing country whose state governments hesitated instant close borders impose lockdowns. I'm much astonished sense responsibility dismayed lack beyond Asia-Pacific region. Chinese buy mink coats Europe. HI, EMT. point wrong, also actively hate now. agree think full lockdowns necessary, people need common sense though. Lmao. lying, gyms open, came one. Thank contribution sub , pathetic piece meat. oh fuck. yeah. worded horribly omg Since March we're WFH zoom meetings still organize specific events much specific restrictions reduction contact.

Because common sense. Lol seen post history. Maybe get computer dumb ass. Primarily first point make. entirely dependent course parameters utilize students for. Using assessment \ treatment medication administration fraught legal ramifications doubt hospital willing take mention unfair student. utilized daily care issues \ VS, assistance treatments direct supervision might it. Compensating protecting paramount.  
 issue article definition mean utilizing students ""nurse"".  careful distinguish nursing type care (i.e. ADLs, VS etc.) registered nurse's duties, responsibilities scope practice. utilize student nurses way outside basic nursing functions dangerous huge liability organization. 

Just thoughts.  point United States pointless testing across State lines. many idiots levels government view testing extra cost want use tax payers' dime. Let's talk Covid deniers either.

Wear mask, limit social circle immediate family go essential goods/services. US twice deaths per capita Canada.  think Black Friday much issue

I drove several stores yesterday parking lots packed. run Walmart something nightmare. Yeah fucked. Ohh vaccines coming soon

To hospital near Pertaining following quote ""there pandemic South Florida"" cannot imagine play next 2 months going rapidly change. Even true South Florida completely controlled virus...the next two upcoming holidays surely bring pandemic South Florida even areas local governments recognized acknowledged pandemic exists, travel restrictions people seem avoiding sacrificing travel holiday season. 

Our worst yet come. Thanksgiving first round, followed Christmas. numerous limited contact traceable events. Many get back return flights either passed virus bringing back home. 

Healthcare workers going probably see break month December leading Christmas. Friends line work wits end. cannot begin imagine worn must be.

Enough frontline workers though (/S) cannot take away much attention whose suffered much real liberties trampled on, like shopping maskless, haircuts binge drinking. 

Rinse/Repeat Txgiving Xmas finally complete whole spectacle one massive super duper spreader evening known New Years Eve. 

To finish rant I'll end like started quote article more. ""It's hard drink mask on.""   Get antibody test symptoms vary greatly person. absolutely symptoms runny nose serious symptoms.

Out six seven people I've talked virus symptoms varied. referring old news mink-to-human transmissions observed two months. Superseded information posted. believe freedom ends impedes anothers. Period. wear mask socially distance stay home that's option. point people smart enough make decisions own. government reduce rights I've done nothing wrong. problem education rights. Educate people make right decision. amazing applaud wearing mask! Keep good fight! Minnesota one fastest growing states Ah agree. Perfect I'm arguing restrictive measures. I'm pushing back narratives ignore consequences restrictive measures. possible ban people state coming back went Florida? live Michigan, many people houses florida too. 

Also, need nationwide response. States locked suffer economically they're protecting citizens. ""you're boss me"" crowd packs goes cesspool state that's racking money, people go back home locked state cost money bring back covid spreading home! timeline coming from? Trump allowed thousands diseased people return US instead leaving China Europe. whole thing could avoided closing borders. specific comment got flagged? don‚Äôt share that.

I‚Äôve comments removed anger auto-mod, must programmed certain words.  best comment ever read throughout shit show. Hello, Swedish friend. UK seem change minds something every days, mass confusion regarding SAGE, Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4, North South, Scotland closing borders enforcing it? 
 30 cops show London close Gym etc [Norway's state epidemiologist Frode] Forland told Swedish radio high spread infection Sweden cause concern country plans reopen border. Similar messages come Finland, interior Minister Maria Ohisalo said Nordic-wide meeting 'travel bubble' countries could Denmark Iceland succeeded stabilising situation. Sweden situation worrying,"" said, also suggesting Finland might put different policies place borders Estonia Sweden depending situations country.

That back May. Norway Finland far better Sweden back then, continue far better Sweden now. knew back strategy would failure, ultimately kept Sweden travel bubble. Several months later, Sweden still wrong.  Lockdowns literally killing us. 

If I'm understanding position correctly, top lockdowns, make gay sex illegal too, stop HIV epidemic spills general population. LiTtErAlLy KlLlinG PeoPLe! time I've ever mentioned downvoted oblivion, know possible is.   Hopefully flips Florida blue? mirrors? Site available EU (usually site can't follow privacy Totally. way people talk medical costs US around makes wonder they've ever actually doctor. 

Yes, prolonged hospital stays uber expensive. time costs seeing doctor (with insurance) costs somewhere range $20-30. Even insurance, every block city walk clinic doctor affordable rate.

Is free, totally not. bankrupt get checkup? Probably not. Hopefully retail you‚Äôre close many people get family members, people wouldn‚Äôt spending much time presence they‚Äôre shopping would sitting thanksgiving lunch group people. Depression exist Nada mas actually I've never cruise. think cramming many people possible relatively small space good idea ocean, land?? Reddit filled arm chair shut ins afraid type human interaction want locked forever Nobody knows yet. right  unlikely, considering dragged hospital like symptoms. unless community spread EVERY infected symptoms long long period, clusters would spotted hit size 100. happened back summer Beijing, several cities Xinjiang. vaccines treatments available doubt it'll much blip then.

It's likely it'll way treat flu someone occasionally saying ""bad covid season year, make sure wash hands much get chance keep immune system up"" Yeah, happened found positive test joke.

My assumption needed show testing lot avoid PR disaster didnt really think ahead that.

Its embarrassing. Im sure reasonably change system avoid consistently bad leadership hope someone figure out. agree. I'm diligent it. true. week later people getting stranded places, reddit mocking ""stupid."" Fauci Trump press conference mid March said travel fine US citizens. world locked couple days later. People choice leave houses believe lot people trial. waited 164 people got infected covid. participants continuing follow masking social distancing protocols. believe right data symptomatic cases. it‚Äôs still incomplete dataset. set says people got vaccine placebo 164 people got sick, 164, 8 people vaccine. vaccine wasn‚Äôt effective would like 82 infected vaccinated group. HOORAY! great news, come guys.. Let‚Äôs go allow inject chemicals us know nothing vaccine rushed usually test trials take 5-7 years. Nothing could go wrong!  
Trust media government, they‚Äôd never lie hurt you. Roll sleeve let‚Äôs let pump us full vaccine. don‚Äôt allow things back normal, let again! Woo hoo! Baaaa baaaa üêë 170 people symptoms tested positive Covid-19. 

162 control group, vaccinated group around result. 

However, 8 expected ~162 exposures vaccinated group became sick symptomatic Covid-19, meaning 95% appear protected vaccine. Well open weren‚Äôt illegal. ty Bullshit.

By point, *quarter million people dead*, survivors ***pissed fuck off*** other, families friends victims permanently-damaged **good reason** -- others claiming oppression, mostly fucking clue real oppression is... **they ones fucking oppressing** **refusing** learn bad!

Normal never coming back. that's good thing, we're burning rug society always swept problems under. Maybe get back dealing cults Reactionaryism (""conservative"" bs), Racism (in violent/enabling cop/attorney ""Thin Blue Line""-snorting forms), Evangelicalism. acknowledge fatigue shame don‚Äôt take simple measures century pandemic. closed bars restaurants Germany beginning November due rapid increase cases September October, we've still record numbers daily new cases past week.

I agree good step reducing infection rates, end people still gather privately pandemic (dinner parties, weddings, etc.) little restrictions actually do.  almost like CDC got guts election passed Moderna vaccine done funds Operation Warp Speed Pfizer one funding comes distribution manufacturing.‚Äù -Jake Tapper

Maybe fact checking simply shit? long minimal symptoms ‚Äúpretty sick‚Äù? woke Friday little sore throat went away. Yesterday little runny nose like allergies. Today runny nose less throat normal pretty much, however feel little run fever. self isolated afternoon emailed DR getting test.  wish economic support ( depends federal action ) keeping kids school mask mandates seem really kept wa numbers far. 

We trending seems pretty slow. place find photos empty hospitals. half? US college students getting fuuuuuucked, help older population risk government won‚Äôt help matters many times heard stories like since pandemic started? ""oh shit made one teensy exception distancing rules got sick, COULD NEVER EXPECTED HAPPEN ME.""

no one change minds personally affects them. that's come to. look many people flying thanksgiving holidays. selfish entitlement. 1.5 Best wishes FIL. used work hospital UP. respiratory tech owned smoke shop town.  FAIL Yes, read that.

As well fact mostly power want us smart enough loyal consumers productive capitalism employees quite smart enough critical and/or analytical thinking own.

Just look school curriculum - lot remembering very, little processes actually teach *think*.

Also told ""We're smart! We're best!"" helps fuel degeneracy. Prepare covid-21. Well know least 6 months that‚Äôs whole lotta people. I‚Äôm still running course covid, atm HR hits 130 every time go flight stairs. blood clot part even scarier though! work restaurant industry restrictions since march virus spread people. workout chosen makes professional football players cry. 

Want guess performed mask on?

Feel free describe workout, seeing expert working mask on. Nah, think going seafood since SO. Looking forward fat $callops! Please don‚Äôt listen this. Vitamin toxicity exists, kill bones liver. Talk doctor concerned vitamin levels interested taking supplements lockdowns work ever get there, Government mismanagement poor compliance means keep ending lockdown let infection rate go far without action. 

What really need quarantine hotels properly functioning test trace isolate system along prevention control education. bad. Sorry Willfully ignorant think anything angelic Europe really haven‚Äôt seen kind shit happening. 

As read earlier doctor regards pandemic: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm standing open field watching tornado approach - starting feel wind face‚Äù. 

Hold tight. I‚Äôm optimistic too.. seems unrealistic. know ""taking precautions?""

The fact ... don't. people are, people aren't. case people taking precautions.

Your 1st sentence blanket statement incorrect. Everything else follows worth debating, given follows incorrect 1st sentence. key part comment unwillingness many Americans comply reasonable health directives stay home orders. quarantining state state basis minimising interstate travel Australia since pandemic began. states fully running back relatively normal now, including interstate travel. worst hit state, 6 million people 700 cases day peak, gone month without cases population mostly complied strict lockdown orders Government supported that. Biden ability convince enough US population behave collective way made worse Republican party, particularly Trump, feeding distrust collective action. Trump coup instead lead start stopped getting far, could providing better leadership convince followers things get better quicker work together instead chose challenge data, raise conspiracy theories take actions kill people. holiday usually. That‚Äôs point. People making tizzy right now. 

There hundreds thousands families things little differently people serve work. 

And don‚Äôt complain much.  They‚Äôre proud it. America forgotten meaning word sacrifice shows. wack off? Oh no! Students refusing test wasn‚Äôt designed even find viruses gives false positives time.

Dear God, horrible people ü§£üòÇ easily get around withholding federal funding. That‚Äôs exactly force states keep legal drinking age 21. Oh no. Anyway  Ever driven Hawaii? takes like week! Jk  sure mean? Nailed it. mention 2% mortality rate, 98% survival rate depending look it. Also, right around 200K death mark, CDC announced 94% fatalities already underlying causes. sure you‚Äôre getting voted. gave upvote. Meanwhile, America, 3 4 engineers (except immigrants) beaten high school. I'm flashing back April, setting MASH style hospitals stadiums convention centers basketball arenas, preparing unthinkable carnage see. I'm flashing back live ""Eyewitness News"" TV reporters microphones 6' stick interviewing experts.

I'm flashing back May facilities quietly packed up, completely unused. I'm remembering lady Eyewitness News time. Surprisingly, much quieter.

I'm comforted 1) bad fearmongers expect, 2) is, somewhere, scores ventilators stadiums set in. WW2 Americans 99.7% survival rate, 1 350 died. response *forced* citizens answer draft pushed armed combat, entire economy restructured feed war effort point citizens melting ornamental items make metal planes bullets.

During 9/11 Americans 99.999% survival rate. 1 115,000 died. response widely curtailed human rights started conflict still continues today.

A 99% COVID survival rate means 1 100 Americans die. COVID's fatality rate 3x worse World War 2 1000x worse 9/11, reasonable minimum similar scale sweeping actions justified. done feeling allowed play God disregard people's rights wishes knows better. friend's father literally deathbed Coronavirus. hospital called wife said, time say goodbye. next day recovered fine.  understand desire businesses wanting stay open shit pure irresponsibility. Go stay fuck home. y‚Äôall. Damn, that‚Äôs stupid. 

Also, wonder long take post-pandemic photos like make cringe. read history context covid anxiety kept friends since March. I‚Äôm happy need social interaction unfortunately micromanaging won‚Äôt help relationship. need find middle ground.

Saying things ridiculous damaging steps *will* need take.  don‚Äôt really feel superior. It‚Äôs exhausted I'm aware. nothing, inconsistency/hypocrisy duly elected officials (/s) sure isn‚Äôt helping matters. politicians tell things like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre together‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going make sacrifices‚Äù, repeatedly get caught things say bad, doesn‚Äôt help. fuck real pandemic isnt it, genious? nah, sorry got it. not, would feel guilty planned better.

Unless grandma gun head, pays bills threatening withhold rent money don‚Äôt go, similar, you‚Äôre traveling free will. quick looking seems almost 50mil people 65+ America around 18mil ""healthcare"" workers (not sure includes healthcare include frontline like police fire) obv. overlapping healthcare workers 65+ older best guess 70mil 2 populations alone. artical correct 40mil doses = 20mil vacinated even half population covered first batchs. means ""does get us way there?"" damn clue. taken positive position insisting neutrality, self-defeating proposition. care things. 7 figure outlier; numbers look quite similar August now. Would enough production capacity able give doses 20 million assumption they‚Äôll enough cover 4 weeks later? don‚Äôt wanna go stay home. Stop imposing beliefs others. Yea sorry masks gonna become lifetime requirement like seat belts. Oh yeah definitely. doubling rate since October keeps 1 million cases daily Christmas. point, thing see preventing run tests. bad handling masks less social distancing exchange.

Huh? thought Swedes could trusted follow recommendations? would suddenly stop following another added? 1. arguing go school primary purpose child care. course main purpose school education.
2. Yes, correct. Parents pay childcare school. However, point making schools concern fact parents work offer programs campus. Educators realize parents work kids care hours day. result programs allow duration longer. reason schools summer care programs. aware parents work need place kids they're working.
3. never said exist solely parents work. fact school occurs work day makes convenient parents work kids cared for. parents understand schools understand this. direct result, parents get jobs understanding work kids school. can't ignore simple fact reality. run company would considered blue collar. employees work organization perform jobs can't done virtually, get paid hourly, live pay check-to-pay check, parents work.  employees take types jobs \*know\* worry kids 8am-3pm M-F. one random day, government decides pull plug backup plan, become disaster. 
4. think looking narrowly. discounting primary purpose, simply making point second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. purposes pretty damn important make decision close need understand ramifications 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. purpose well. school (and many others) polling sites weeks ago. closed schools entire county day polling taking place schools. primary purpose schools educate purpose all, this? also serve purposes. 

Again, confuse think mess. like anyone else does. hear things like ""close schools"" shudder one things carefully thought extreme implications. think elected officials place plan anything like concerned appeasing group individuals rolling sleeves coming real plan would address concerns EVERYONE. half assed attempts lock downs shut downs done essentially nothing. think 2021 happen

How's going work? Like, midnight New Year's everything goes black moment see words, ""One year later"" sight returns?

I could live that. 2 - 7 record, fan apathy greatest danger right now. while. Governor one worst terms taking seriously dont know meth tap water even know would consider intelligent really give shit.

One favourite movie lines still good quote. going answer question? main anxiety subreddit ‚Äú2020 umbrella thread.‚Äù ""Don't open, dead inside"" According you, party people headline murderers they're partying spread disease someone die.

By precisely logic, also murderer going work spread disease someone die. think murders justified. Oh ha nbd...thinking I'm enjoy Sunday anyway. Said say . stay safe all. people tend optimistic ever be

Can get that? I'm way cynical depressed be. heard anecdotally case early New York. remember thinking needed extra careful didn‚Äôt accidents didn‚Äôt need go hospital reason whatsoever. transmission vectors seen many studies. latest study show part cause second wave.

Children also develop MIS-C. assume Catholic, otherwise they'd left long time ago allowed eat meat Fridays Lent. paid holidays many employees get something special dates.

Many Americans get 5 fewer days paid time off. order time actually travel see family, need combine PTO fixed holidays get.  people go work office employer forces us go. We‚Äôre doomed hate feeling I'm hunkering apocalypse, world goes normal outside door. so-called ""lockdown"" sad joke compared real lockdowns China Vietnam.

Also done Feb. would worn guests drinking eating.

It's bar. always drinking. Oh good god, hope not. right mind would want bring baby evil world? Healthcare first, Frontline, elderly. That's best guess. 250,000 Americans dead don‚Äôt care. get it. Mom even begun sharing anti-masl/vaccine/""covid serious"" stuff Facebook. 

Also Thanksgivings usually like 40 people deep south. I'll stick Fauci, let know walked back something. still people somehow think massive worldwide hoax remember allowing grocery delivery people house going ""Are buying like office something?"" ""Is camping"" coming stupid stories office manager buying stuff winter ski trip. remember woman lowes asking ""one crazy/paranoid people worried flu"". remember thinking moment ""I cleaning supplies, want look crazy"" said ""Oh no.

Same. saw videos coming China started late January. Feb kicked notch someone Reddit said ""If US keeps pace timeline think know China, we'll need-to-lockdown territory Friday, March 13th"". 



I told two friends, made fun me, parents, really made fun me, actually started pay attention Feb 29th. time March 13th rolled around folks pretty well prepared. Ten months in, firmly believe amount campaigning messaging going change anyone anything. ‚ÄúStates responsible deciding gets vaccine first, recommended priority given risk, like front-line workers elderly.‚Äù It‚Äôs gonna strictly healthcare workers, also include at-risk. California least, one supposed carrying. take guns place legitimate purpose, like gun store hunting range. locked trunk part.

*Supposed be*, felony adhere that. Granted, anyone going shoot anyone mask shit, they're probably worried felonies. Could Trump actually done anything? could actively treated hoax, would good start. could contributed mask wearing turned politically polarized issue encouraged right wing terrorists kidnap state governor enforcing state mask laws. That's literally tip iceberg really involved things. could weighed second round stimulus instead ""holding election"" felt like pretty blatant bribe. shit, could tried organize full country lockdown help eliminate (or least limit spread). 

Now next question, yes, Biden options available mid January going complete cluster fuck complete total shut might touch. live highly educated bubble friends continues live enjoy highly temporary existence Y‚Äôall getting kind creepy here.

I mean fuck guys selfish putting peoples lives risk, still.

That‚Äôs creepy AF positive cases means there'll people near people getting tested too. can't sure sick people get tests healthy not. actually time read headlines. headlines *should* accurately represent story anyway.... Something keep mind though that, geographically US fucking huge. means also way likely larger separation views places. 

Near me? 90% people wear masks. Nobody wear mask grocery stores. Stationed police remove store refuse to. 

However, probably places US true places is.  Pretending empathetic lot people claim seems exhausting.. for, seem morally ""superior""?

Stop fooling Lying never leads net benefit, there‚Äôs always resulting decrease benefit everyone somewhere don‚Äôt understand interconnected . process cope different ways. don‚Äôt know persons experience is.
