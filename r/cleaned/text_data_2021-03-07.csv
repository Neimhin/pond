0,2021-03-07," Trump probably simply speaking someone also seen collapse videos. FYI, Canada updated vaccine distribution page reflect 1.5M Pfizer doses Q1 0.5M AstraZeneca doses Q1 well rest 2M Moderna doses. doses means people protected. great Separate entity what?

I’m American, I’m asking honest questions. tell, NHS department UK government. Thus, reasonable definition, *is* government. Texas evil megazord chainsaw massacre variant **complete speculation**, China locked hard government knew multiple viruses escaped Wuhan lab? caused seizures; SARS-Cov-2 became pandemic. ""Viruses viruses can’t control masks,"" said GOP Rep. John Fillmore Apache Junction. 

What? would relevant. concern variant escapes natural infection vaccine provided immunity develop spread, won’t matter starts. read pennlive article?

The amount ""pork"" basically nothing. called everything would pork amounts sliver 1.9T. I’m ok vaccination news repetitive. It’s better repetition bad news. read paper? synthetic lab experiment involving people actual virus global study types actions effective (which would hellbent find now, think lancet) concluded circumstances, areas, stages spread, schools shut far effective.. without question. Interesting, thanks link. 

Careful though, put words mouth. never said psy ops. I'm saying hire army English majors sling BS Facebook Twitter sloppy squalid government that. 

Which, fair, thing linked also troll farm. short: Stop voting Tropical Trump(s). RemindMe! 3 months Can't blame virus wanting India /s dual citizen UK America, know exactly fucked healthcare compared UK. small Russian news sites social media accounts root cause skepticism. Sometimes people want first line willing wait, especially healthy. like saying reason people support political party propaganda they've seen. might latch onto bs science, like mRNA changing DNA, others rational individuals attacked deplorable political party biases.

It even seem working, Russians Russia far, far skeptical Americans getting less skeptical. poll sociologists Levada Centre week found 30% Russians willing receive Sputnik V - 8% since rollout began, despite safety data public. 

This r/politics r/Geopolitics, muh Russia basically sums Cold War fears US establishment. oligarchic country dependent oil economy size NY amist demographic collapse trolls around... ***triggered***. ""Lawful"" according people said operations. investigated found wrongdoing, course. could doubt convincing exoneration? still think US engaged lawful military operations abroad, recommend read ""Killing Hope: U.S. Military CIA Interventions since World War II"" William Blum. get first dose vaccine 10 days first day class, they'll safe. demand can't return in-person learning there's 100% chance they'll get vaccinated time overly-cautious, almost selfish. teacher's union gain sympathy public constantly demanding special treatment beyond literally every line work gets. Go birds. Light bulbs 100% natural. Also internet cars. Weak suspicion part. Could obvious (lower average age obesity rates) account lower death rates. Cool, that's great you, random redditor, personally know anyone thought that, see countless stream comments people disappointed we're getting $2000 checks, LOT people expect feel duped $1400 checks. Surely level confusion could easily avoided phrase ""$1400 checks"" ever used campaigning instead won. probably Amero-centric. pretty good mask-compliance Australia, although small minority anti-maskies think they're cool-kids whatever facebook says. Omg fats crazy. Yes walk treadmill watching reality TV mask matter. basic science sweat, mask gets wet, mask gets dense, can't breathe it. simple. we’re nearly point others either also unlikely suffer significant disease already opportunity vaccine. This. major issue is, long time been, mutations.

Sure, deaths going go down. Excellent, good news.

But keep screwing around acting like everything fine, going end another mutation makes current vaccines mostly useless. back square one.

People need wait till hit herd immunity vaccines + recoveries. But, seems like much ask. would excellent strategy. would argue long make sure test everyone coming in, even need full lockdown inside facility. could selectively locked new inmates left rest alone.

There might lot angst visitations reduced due testing requirements, end day incarcerated individuals - outcry would lower got Covid (which happened). Same. three months prior getting vaccine, average day, probably 6-8 residents 12-15 staff either symptoms positive test. Since got vaccine, cases cleared new ones. doesn't. sweat mask gets wet hinders breathing..... Florida relaxed restrictions, state mask mandate, clubs/sports whatnot open months months. California one harshest lockdowns country duration pandemic. Despite that, states saw relatively similar outcomes. 

The argument measures significant effects, we’d expect see difference outcomes. Counterarguments I’ve seen vary often involve climate 31M received 2 doses. Another 40M received one dose. end April, another 110M-140M doses administered. means 40M get second dose another 70M+ initiate. total we'll 140M+ adults partial full immunity end April - comfortably 128M needed majority. Add people already got infection vaccines looking close 70% population immunity end April. I'll surprised talking covid-19 mid May that'd indicate new strain made vaccines much less effective. antibodies nothing article worthless? Hopefully get sooner mate! I'm glad I've mine although gave awful fever, headache body aches last night normal, especially younger due immune systems. Agreed early fever, get significantly worse fever Covid. fever vaccine much less intense last long.

So woman 20 weeks would really come exposure risk. person working highly exposed, probably better get vaccine asap. able social distance work home, probably better wait. /u/iBoMbY, *U.S. officials*. doubt neutral, unbiased uninterested source *U.S. officials*?

There's doubt masks reduce spread virus honestly consider posting articles like completely useless, one wearing mask gym would see say ""Oh guess safe, I'll start wearing now.""

Personally think relation prevalent vegetarianism cusine. May things like turmeric help concrete study back assumption. ""We're nearly this"" I've hearing now. every time states ease restrictions, met army angry people declare, ""It's soon!""

Maybe pessimistic, times feels like always ""too soon"" lot people here. Yeah, Americans get unemployment plus stimulus checks. Simple facts. COVID healthcare costs zero States, even without health insurance. Yeah bet fertility fallen too!!!! /S types FB groups called? would love help older folks get appointments pretty techy saavy. know math? -5% flat? idiot? No, neither US.  dismiss studies like that. article absolutely getting correlation causation. conclusion founded theory causation infinite amount variables thrown out.

What’s bull shit? What’s lie? Name one thing.  exercise outdoors, risk \_much\_ lower usually fine without mask. 6 months ago would agreed much Europe lockdown throughout winter even New Zealand Australia aren’t truly back normal still lockdown cities week hardly notice there’s handful new cases. isn’t diss NZ’s response it’s lot better US’s, it’s reality unexpected short lockdowns control cases enough people vaccinated want keep numbers low. No, talking VO2 max efforts, roughly pace 3 5 minutes. means running speed cycling wattage would reduced 10%. would little effect endurance tempo efforts. Like someone else said, similar training altitude. We've already bought enough doses vaccinate everyone US. matter production distribution. see Osterholm made “eye hurricane” claim. 

 gave pursuing Meteorology college tell certain eye hurricane doesn’t last long. literally admitted past posts numbers indeed high even then, numbers still decreasing.

Let guess bright. need explain decrease means?  go CDC site read airborne transmission takes place like dogs do. Except dogs vaccinated. But, pass antibodies various coronaviruses offspring. good news means possibly, humans able same. arguing point time gets hot south, vaccinated.

Show anything schools shutdown lack funding opposed covid restrictions. can’t cause they’re thankfully people charge giving funding schools. 

To go along funding cares act hasn’t used. want believe otherwise, go live best life,

Believe otherwise? talking about?  Sure, safe. also sucks balls.

I'll go running cycling instead, thank you. Depends state, mine, that’s got it. Gained Covid hit lol. qualify, get it. Nobody going bother ask prove anything anyway. No, that's stupid. Especially someone obvious condition like syndrome. Why? got completely ass backwards LOL. actually think N95 better working cloth mask? 

N95 airflow 95% effective blocking Covid micron size viral particles. 

Cloth masks dog shit massively increased airflow less filtration. pace they'll take 46 days, I'm sure pace continue pick up. Regardless though we're 46 days less number. drug analog cytidine causes virus’s RNA-directed RNA polymerase (the enzyme copies RNA) make catastrophic number errors. result, virus cannot make proteins progeny viruses.

Even promising: medicine effective RNA viruses. influenza, measles, Ebola, enteroviruses, Zika, RSV, norovirus, etc.

Now, let’s realistic. RNA virus infections, viral loads peak around time symptoms begin, antiviral drugs push viral loads bit faster, usually modest effects clinical course. That’s anti-influenza medicines like oseltamivir (TAMIFLU) baloxivir (XOFLUZA) slightly reduce duration symptoms even given within 48h symptom onset.

But broad-spectrum antiviral like valuable addition armamentarium, especially next RNA virus pandemic strikes. Thank well. great aunt passed catching assisted living. even moved state. going year now. You’ve hiding long peek head see people living lives normal  Male birth control would devastatingly negative effects birth rate history. Women use birth control nearly much men. hoping biggest polluting, disease super spreading vessels would die out. I'm gonna continue argument. Well, 1.8% votes last US election third parties, vs 33% Canada. parties like NDP, BQ, Green Party routinely win seats gives power federal level voters, kingmakers party forms absolute majority. vote NDP throwaway way voting libertarian US.

The biggest reason difference is, presumably, instead voting delegates power except able vote president, Canadians voting MPs actually full time job representing district voting policies office. That's enough give parties local appeal path towards power. 

In theory votes representative US congress allow small parties thrive US practice people pick president vote ticket people help president actually get things done independents hard time getting taken seriously. Psychologically two systems different, enough people \*believe\* third parties wield real power voting become spoiler vote. string bad calls around time frame, probably luck (Stats eh). look pretty bad though. Unless children all. still stay outdoors. I’m militant mask wearing 95 science believing protocol hearing person planet earth.

Yes, I’ve two friends pass away (45 54). hits someone know, it’s much real made super careful. sorry friend’s loss.

For Taxpayer funded research - government share IP ability give licenses. NM? Nursing homes semi-isolated communities methods entry virus. pandemic started first places lock risk extremely high got in. proliferate unchecked inside, demographics make lethal virus. 

The people allowed pandemic started staff worked there. visitors allowed. Limiting controlling outbreak communities possible bit luck proper management (regular testing, regular use PPE, adequate staffing resources). US highest recorded death rate COVID per capita world, clear differences policies results peer countries, one salient basic facts pandemic. United States less deaths per capita Italy, UK, Hungary, Belgium, Portugal, Slovenia, Czechia. 

...but even actions - aggregate contributed pandemic perpetuating - things keep conditions worse, making businesses suffer more, resulting unemployment etc, would think could empathize enough thought twice behavior.

My actions change anything. government control lockdowns entire time. end date always going enough people vaccinated, regardless number cases leading that. That's becoming incredibly apparent approach summer vaccinations ramping up. really think could reopened sooner right leadership policies? could US done resume level normalcy summer 2021, even countries like UK Italy citizens trust government failed fact can’t connect complete federal inaction 1 year, 500,000+ deaths, data show even wearing masks would brought number lower hundreds thousands

[Here actual data mask found mandates along restaurant closures resulted single-digit % reduction cases. nationwide mask mandate saved ""hundreds thousands"" lives, real-world effectiveness masks never close effective lab effectiveness. Even enforce mandated 100% public, completely undermined people socialize private.

I wanna defeatist, see approach take. theory yes could ended pandemic last spring stayed home two weeks wore masks, reality that's possible. like saying could eradicate obesity people followed government dietary guidelines, getting upset people follow guidelines keep obese.

My belief “vaccines change behavior” narrative hitting point makes people want/care about/be rush vaccine, hope it’s laid back shows people start chill out. MIL got J&amp;J shot yesterday. Said hurt injected burned 5 minutes, nothing else morning. pain, fever. 61. Everybody different wanted share remember reading Australia borders restricted 2022. become fall-back position COVIDists.

They can't really use ""you're going kill grandma"" anymore (since grandma vaccinated), become ""you're going create vaccine-resistant variant"". hilariously anti-science, predictable. love New Zealand. Instead getting ideological, go what's needed serve protect population.

No country perfect, outperforming much larger countries far greater resources.

Tip o' hat Kiwis! one thing first came one knew exactly came going versus year better understanding mutations variants. comes China intentionally released it, rational people agree that's crime humanity.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus). Please include link submission.* That’s point. We’ve heard people afraid take vaccine. That’s you’re talking about. We’re talking people think even take vaccine never allowed maskless public, won’t bother. I’ve heard people Reddit fearing people think like that, haven’t even heard Redditors actually finding people mentality. reading replies, seems people agree. US partnership EU. Never will. Americans don’t want it. Get China one really giving away. Given pacific-4 met discuss worry China's vaccine diplomacy, think US soon US enough vaccinations everyone (at least hope).

But doubt Russia follows suit. guidelines aren’t concert venues stores etc checking peoples vaccine cards. small personal groups like friend groups family. specifically says public still mask social distance concerns forged vaccination cards seem relevant right People starting families young age 100,000 years. called biology evolution. feminist think mother wife slavery.

The article fake news. North Texas small business gonna get real interesting :)

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understatement Seems right. see slight bump cases relaxed restrictions variants spreading, vaccinations keep hospitalizations deaths down. would like point study done using less effective 4 week interval doses. Studies since approved shown 55% effective original virus UK variant, rises 81% efficacy interval 12 weeks. could would show efficacy SA strain 12 week interval. Even single dose, efficacy reaches 76% 12 weeks, might also AZ slow effect body trail short. seem pretty firm upcoming weekend increase now. dad volunteers vax centre 45 day last weeks, never Pfizer. Next weekend booked appointments going roof, says, including three days thousand appointments each. Virus data exactly hard interpret. like METAR data. assumption - access data re: transmissions know vaccine availability explode want get messaging encourage people take vaccine becomes available Brazil. Obviously lack international travel slowed spread. Dude, ask opinion deal family. asking prove someone got it. information, responding? agree /u/american_amadan216. I've hearing experts still need cautious, new variants could cause case numbers rebound March *if* keep wearing masks vaccination numbers increase. 

For part, vaccinations increased people still following protocols, We're barely second week March. think heard UK variant makes 20% COVID positive tests, still might affect overall recovery. hope people continue using common sense safety get vaccinated turn comes up. Um... choosing KPI based models best available data far cry ""asking scientists fudge numbers."" may disagreement KPI be, nothing wrong one. 

Nice false dichotomy. CDC finally says vaccinated people don’t need wear masks near other. We’re getting there. 🙌 thx bb Vaccination still recommended people COVID. Infection confer immunity, it’s less consistent vaccine.

Antibody tests would limited use. accurate people COVID within last months, pandemic going year. mines at? I'm sorry, would prefer journalists report this? say trends report gross total deaths (so gets higher day)? make higher numbers? headlines look like ""Ah! Stay House, Still Dangerous""?

Yeah, still relatively high levels virus circulating. things genuinely getting better, cases/hospitalizations/deaths coming horrific numbers successful rollout safe effective vaccine. genuinely idea take issue reporting that. tell people things incredibly dangerous plainly getting better, people convinced stay inside. They're convinced trust reasonable public health guidance. suppose also think report vaccines incredibly effective people still cautious vaccinated?

Rescinding mask mandates right smart decision IMO. blame entirely Abbott. Point finger governors opening flood gates we're rock-solid ground. Suggesting journalists' fault making things look worse borders incomprehensible me. Honestly everyone mindset never them. Pack everyone, guy says antibody tests reliable showed detectable antibodies 9 months sick!

/s

News flash, every individual’s body reacts sickness differently, immune system still elevated levels covid antibody doesn’t mean people detectable levels 9 months (or given point, really) sickness. I'm putting back important. I'm tired scientists like abused   “oh can’t predict everybody live lives again” crap going wear technically corruption science. ""I dont' know"" valid answer, little common sense tell ""not much longer"" Literally got mine today that, didn’t feel bad ether happened me...March 10-11 2020, strange 36 hour “flu”...I received flu shot early winter generally quite healthy rarely ill. Intense headache!, total loss appetite, hacked little blood shower morning, sudden surprise diarrhea... gone. sat next outwardly sick person airplane 12 days prior weren’t really thinking corona yet... “somewhere else”. Figured later must it. Negative antibodies May 2020.  extensive blood panel routine physical January 2021 showed antibodies. Maybe bad 24 hr flu... never know. Waiting number called immunization now. like seeing good news posts. 👍 Dammit! *gives reluctant follow-upvote* really wish government would honest admit real reason vaccinated people still wear masks people would lie vaccinated get it... Like know that's ""saying quiet part loud"" whole lying masks working last year, need government honest us otherwise even distrust line. Like 3 weeks anyone get vaccine want it, I'll bet messaging completely changes interest, would feel another country started blocking imports ingredients needed vaccine EU?

Surely bad business, EU want countries getting EU made vaccines them, allowed sale countries. Talk cake eat it.

This also really backfired countries trusted EU, would known beforehand case, could went elsewhere setup manufacturing countries. fact spouted would partake vaccine nationalism probably secured manufacturing lot orders. 

This embarrassing around EU helping vaccinate countries around world good news story EU. That’s exactly herd immunity via natural infection never option Ok don’t hang liars without wearing mask events sure. agree. didn’t mean say events weren’t COVID. non-academic world 

Again, incorrect. real world need accurate data make rockets fly, vaccines function, epidemiology data make correct predictions. Asking scientists fudge numbers erodes trust process. 54 million 65+ Americans (I think, struggling find Census data going based non gov site).

The CDC says 29,748,078 65+ gotten 1+ doses vaccine.

That puts us 55% 65+ crowd.

Now assume 70% people take vaccine, thats 37.8 million adults. would mean 78.69% way done 65+ adults take vaccine. 

I think get around 65% overall, need consider opening pharmacies everyone vaccines. Maybe keep slots open give priority 65+ still point, everyone whos 65+ either gotten it, appointment already, doesnt want (or wants still wait little longer). armour mask, variety cloth disposable masks.
number 1 comfort disposable (although use once) ""boat style"" masks, buy Korea Hong Kong. friend different face shape prefers ""2d"" , also known ""duck style"" masks.

Depends stay 6 feet away people household. can't, still recommended wear mask since know park vaccinated not. I’m weirdly looking forward dealing new issues life. Lol relax buddy, messing around you. great day :) remember working crowded, maskless event winery year ago now. learned event one couples arrived Italy (which getting hit hard time) week beforehand.

Nobody got tested. symptoms. knows many patrons workers got it, asymptomatic transmitted others. This. Reddit upvotes things based intellectual *sound,* intellectual are. Add compelling anecdote bingo.

That's even knock essential worker above. shit definitely happened sucks. healthy reminder anything discredit ""4x confirmed cases"" number CDC estimates. Well they’re entering winter soon tourism would naturally drop anyways Sure, possible. possible caught cold January 2020, getting annual flu shot previous fall, never flu since started getting shots, causing intense flu like symptoms I've ever had, lasted almost 3 weeks, dad, almost never gets sick, symptoms days later, caused ER visit detectably elevated levels biomarkers heart damage, known common symptom Covid.

That definitely possible. think likely explanation events. nose? man predicted cases falling january one else did, i'll go model cases mid-april go back early february levels falling good. Ha, yeah we'll mid-30s kid (probably one) choice point, looking forward lot descibed. yet UK 1828 deaths/million Florida 1475 deaths/million. Yea. 1 day bit tired; 2 days ass; 3 days with. Yeah around March 2020 RSV got son lot symptoms covid. never lost smell though. hadn’t tested positive RSV time might assumed covid. Except 66% effective blocking mild cases. makes approximately 66% better vaccinating someone. almost everyone mother (myself included) story felt sick January-March means ""definitely it."" 100% convinced March. 2 antibody tests later summer winter confirmed not, fact, ever coronavirus. really bad flu/cold/whatever. family members extremely cavalier around holidays convinced immune prior infection ""the whole family sick"" back January 2020. Let's say found hard way wrong (thankfully survived without hospitalization -- spent 2 really shitty weeks barely able get bed I'm surprised break rib coughing). Seeing 10x number cases would almost 5he whole country population dont think thats true anymore guidelines friend family groups hanging out, groups strangers (still need mask that) would assume would know trust circle vaccinated course call ""mUh RaCiSm"". allowed criticize Chinese government? Oh, banned too? *sigh...upvotes, begrudgingly.* I've heard think mostly due different variants.   grandfather Alzheimer's. Biden acts sounds like early stages. fact, told Biden anything wrong 10 years ago, I'd call crazy. Hell, even know apparently stutter entire time VP clearly control. 

But he's clearly senile now. understand anyone deny obvious. either ignorant actively denying reality. LOL fact think he's even remotely charge.  headline misleading important accurate talking literal life death situations, deadly, global pandemic. didn’t cover up? older relatives eligible get vaccine available area yet still gotten fully trust say waiting see others it. means exactly long intend wait, idea. fall group fallen conspiracy theories push conversation can't go them. So...yes people exist. know new CDC guidance actually make difference people think way hope. Truth. used live blocks north Wrigley. could always tell game day Since website stopping data collection analysis, similar sites? especially appreciated deeper dives numbers, like explaining death counts February seemed high lot states dumping old data onto counts. thought r/Coronavirus r/NewZealand propaganda proxy? care enough keep commenting. there’s that. Take care. need wait government tell OK, though?

I mean, everyone vaccinated that's far endgame get. Generally speaking, get get. I'd imagine providers getting 1 type time, next order comes in.

The one exception think places like NYC announced overnight appointments mega-sites given JNJ vaccine (I assume due storage requirements) People waiting later later kids lot reasons. gas already burning fire. Couldn’t tell often change opinion advice. Virginia’s actually really well vaccinating I’m glad we’ve confirmed masks virtue signaling Missouri counties designated state receive vaccine cancelling events low registration. dOwNvOtEs prOvE rIgHt 🤣🤣 NY state ran sites, clearly label what. sign want. disagree take. also important stop transmission J&amp;J preventing mild cases, probably preventing transmission. literally exactly said? 2 months heard nothing ""the variants going cause explosion cases soon! wait!"". turning boy cried wolf kind thing. fair, neither original comment reply anything speculation. NSW covid free 50 days. still require 2 weeks quarantine. NZ Nsw travel bubble, quarantine.

Nz much higher rates covid NSW. covid now. Interesting! think though need see vitro vivo data concluding one strategy less protective different strains. Always handy government run election get free televised briefings whenever want none parties allowed go campaigning.

Expect things magically change May.  everyone get vaccinated. Realistically 60-70% people vaccinated end pandemic, sooner later. would huge huge issues someone worked enclosed space without disclosing awaiting test results. WTF? also ask folks hang they're feeling symptomatic recent exposures. that's really cool behavior part. must administered within three months travel period 

What mean? get vaccinated December mean rule apply me? gonna pretend understand roll procedure healthy dad 67 got vaccine 63 year old mother who’s diabetic 52 years stents heart. Seems little wonky. Baseless assumptions bad, it’s good thing you’ve said enough dumb shit thread nobody needs make ok already they're vaccinated...  turn everything drive thru... even vax sites.

our laziness paying dividends. 


we wait cars anything! 100% certain wife, son got early February last year. Vegas four days, going place pandemic yet thing. 

We know America early December. America, originated China, anywhere west coast Vegas. Right time Chinese New Year celebrations. 

We came back, 5 days arrived Vegas wife got really, really sick. day later son lighter symptoms, knew got us (he Vegas). ""the worst cold"" either wife ever had, lasted week.

No one ever counted us. Remind me! 45 days think creating two classes (of behaviors) vaccinated unvaccinated people problem, honest (low) transmission vaccinated people Right - informed, included primary endpoint (whether placebo vaccine) unless multi-symptomatic respiratory. widely reported Moderna Pfizer check mild asymptomatic infection see linked FDA document.

Efficacy based PRIMARY endpoint - 90 cases placebo arm, 5 cases vaccine arm.

They collect info secondary endpoints data may coming Pfizer Moderna relates mild asymptomatic infections. I'm sorry misinformed. States already getting vaccines disturbing health care networks Biden. state recently launched second last priority group.

The thing changed rate production think Biden that, cult member. I've lived germany new zealand covid. trust me, german lockdown compare strict nz one was, all.

The german one might appear strict paper, farmers markets, schools open, etc. even close nz last april even get takeaway food

But yes, harder europe many (still) open land borders got vaccine. idiots continue ruin effective is, lose mind. race continue living horrible COVID limbo blows mind. lack care life others truly disheartening.

Finally good news. I’ve read multiple sites J&amp;J delivery numbers Netherlands (and thus also EU) promising. Netherlands get small number April, larger number May even larger number June. Magneto thinks he's beautiful. LOL whole week. gave teachers one day (a Friday) once. They're gonna another Friday dose 2. Don’t think requires IQ points sign vaccine factories given country? like 10 vaccine factories within EU, couple states. seems EU way much trust contracts would delivered good faith (mistake). 

Anyway, glad law amended finally utilized vaccines cannot exported without local EU contracts met first. P1-P3 went back full time Scotland couple weeks ago. rest today (but part time). CDC guidelines written extremely conservative view aimed general population audience. almost certainly extremely careful giving advice would make people believe ok skip second dose, would recommend, want added antibody response help longevity variant fighting ability.

However, look studies, single shot Moderna Pfizer 3 week mark gives adequate immune response 90% protection, evidenced Israeli study. Yah lot pharmacies it. it’ll truly available get shopping like flu shot. 

We begin move away max vax sites IMO Yes, planning try make happen. That's one good thing look forward to! OC here, definitely open most. Maybe next weeks now. actually unsubbed last June periodically checked felt like visiting sub reading “you get COVID 19 die” mean, seeing people person homes kind big one. Incorrct 100%. also important note line jumpers really sabotaging anything. They're sort unethical kinda jerks, we've gotta hit 75% population vaxxed herd immunity, matter slice it. Literally thing significantly hurts efforts toss doses sitting shelf you’re going look this, don’t read article, read study 

This article *awful*. 10 fold decrease antibody titers mean vaccine 10 times less effective like article states. Results still showed adequate neutralization variant Hm, think CDC trying protect vulnerable members public don’t know vaccinated people transmit covid others. 

The CDC says ok low-risk unvaccinated person interact without mask vaccinated person home, ok high-risk person interact without mask vaccinated person. tells CDC somewhat ok healthy people getting mild covid (because probably won’t die—set aside long covid concerns minute), high risk person going really hard time. 

I expect guidance change learns whether vaccinated transmit covid others, regardless whether person healthy sick begin with. 

It reads like compromise. Hospitals point anymore. articles feature people favor zero covid. multiple players I'm sure headaches getting running, right seems like two main aspects need addressed:

1) Coding incoming data map properly J&amp;J vaccine

2) Code count J&amp;J vaccine 1+ dose doses column

2a) Rename ""both doses"" ""completed regimen"" something similar reflect fully vaccinated

I'm saying could done overnight, J&amp;J entered phase 3 trials single dose vaccine 6 months ago. accounted ready day one rollout. susceptible 2-3 months reinfection. anyone earlier November isn’t vaccinated recatch it.

Congrats America! tested antibodies representative cross sections population (think grocery stores, etc) calculated percentage samples antibodies. 

Then compared percentage percentage confirmed infections area voila! true all, sorry friend. guidance creates two buckets two smaller buckets one : at-high-risk/at-low-risk, unvaccinated/vaccinated. individual unvaccinated/at-low-risk (say, healthy child), guidelines errs side allowing vaccinated individual interact unvaccinated/at-low-risk person without masks. Why? vaccinated person transmit virus (we don’t know yet), unvaccinated person scenario unlikely get anything mild covid. healthy child almost certainly going ok. That’s true at-high-risk/unvaccinated person (say, diabetic hypertensive 50 year old). Hence continued restriction interaction. 

Why like this? far know, CDC isn’t fully explaining itself, wonder trying balance needs, covid. Mental health, example. Social disruption isolation dangerous too. 🤷‍♀️ Vaccines already rolling Trump office. plan Biden using, dude. Shame eating easy eggs CDC guidelines never careful.

Until data definively showing escape variant exists reflected case numbers, see point worrying engaging semantic arguments.

1. Get shot can.
2. Brilliant scientists already whipping boosters, comes that. We'll far better prepared face variants need arise. still, even approved, many unvaccinated people left Italy enough alternatives towards end year. I'm fine lockdowns unravelling lifting everything soon. takes weeks vaccination vaccines even offer full protection we're close need vaccines drop mask mandates yet. Even waiting mid April would allow lot people get vaccinated. Every projection he’s made almost ten fold. truth scary enough, constant fear mongering Osterholm helps one. Everyone I’ve talked said nothing sore arm happened 1st dose. sever Covid December ended machine help breath. excited get vaccine make wait 3 months since last positive. got first dose first 4 hours fine the. started getting really sweaty reason wandered traffic got hit semi truck! wife 103 fever felt horrible 3 days went away! Still 100 million times better Covid-19! Fauci didnt listen politicans though deaths threats speaking idiot That's lockdown means! even get idea China starving people covid? food trucks delivering food constantly. emergency vehicles, type vehicle allowed food delivery bikies. 

Are suggesting US better job reporting death tracking cases?

'everything control', 'this big flu', 'it go away magically', 'i want wear mask violating freedom'. tell sounds like coming US China. Fantastic! need one Europe badly Blow dart guns..........but seriously best clear misconceptions accept it, hopefully also like following restrictions already  makes lot sense I'd still say they're better US (purely terms minority party influence), though great example, agreed. Especially still reasonably influential monarchy.

Should gone Norway, Sweden, something like that. Didn’t say week ago didn’t work? got mine morning, husband told keep moving arm around like circular motion. seems help, arm isn’t bad. He’s billion vaccines army say help soreness. finish line isn’t right yet keep changing goal posts...or remember “3 weeks flatten curve?” Italy would use Sputnik V approved EMA. not, export doses. VA. Signed 75 yr old dad month ago still able get it. ahaha. i’m sure, man. i’m sure. Same.

We 65 older healthcare workers only. fucking March. come Ah yea, ol double dragon strategy. Spring break baby! feel guilty getting mine work office job versus two friends work grocery store Uber driver idea get theirs. would decided get mine work, HR basically said everyone get got mine. forced like need good reason get one. I'm expert know understand rules well enough tell answer, I'm sorry.

I think needs clarity households every member household vaccinated? CA would eligible you’re wrong, Sydney closer Hobart Auckland Wellington swear God convention fat activists logos McDonalds fast food restaurants background materials. source linked North Dakota, example, clearly shows rise cases holiday season.

Sorry, that's little disingenuous, best.

North Dakota's cases reached peak November 18. small bump Thanksgiving (which honestly looks like noise barely perceptible zoom out) slightly larger (but still relatively small) bump xmas/NYE.

The deaths hospitalizations followed cases, everywhere.

While certainly argue holiday gatherings effect, effect small compared overall trend virus barely even worth mentioning. certainly can't point primary driver. literally en masse.

luckily, I'm both. end Trump pandemic 2021 make CNN new C-SPAN terms boring news talk.

Thats get everything ""Breaking News"" every minute every day. plague's perspective, killing hosts lose game. one spread to, effectively exterminated unless happens mutate less deadly form jumps another species. [not even little found large effect closing schools universities conjunction, remarkably robust across different model structures, variations data, epidemiological assumption"" Got first Pfizer today arm kills. somewhat fatigued also three young kids lot night I'm sure haha I'm waiting someone explain bad thing. claiming new variant arise could possibly work vaccine.. people natural slaves. What’s definition pedant? Talk them, listen them, express feel differently, lead example, hope change minds. Vaccinated people wearing masks public following science. Today, come anywhere near herd immunity though. ~18% population vaccinated. Polio eliminated overnight. year vaccine, 1954, US 38,000 cases. 1962 cases fell 1000, 1979 completely eradicated US. That’s really bad thing, means know naturally immune it. Got first dose pfizer vaccine today! far typical vaccine reaction sore injection site that’s all. Can’t wait lick doorknobs again. idea ""some sources say is"". opinion stated ""how hell anyone tell isn't?"" 

 case, ask primary care doctor and/or insurance provider.

I'm sorry I'm unable helpful. real useful thing say I've dealt depression long time, seen enormous number friends family affected symptoms depression year, particularly winter (Northern hemisphere). 

But clinically useful call depression real reasons feel shitty? Idk. opinion would they'd benefit therapy, rushing take drugs seems questionable- stuff best reserved people chronically depressed even good times- clear cause unhappiness. dog gets run over, feel said medicating away (not works way anyway) goal. 

You definitely ask Primary Care provider and/or insurer. also take simple steps require doctor- exercise good diet, socializing extent able, scheduling activities, talking friends/family, etc. basic stuff. also lot reason feel hopeful pandemic easing many places, winter northern hemisphere lifting, etc im sorry, screwing kids 1 year physically recieving education educating online thing schooling all. 

additionally we're talking education system hasnt given complete overhaul since industrial era, blindly assume format educate children effective option would quite ignorant. simply option we're used to. however, many kids need go factory work? likely many generation. 

and [here study mentioned didnt found large effect closing schools universities conjunction, remarkably robust across different model structures, variations data, epidemiological assumption"" two weeks second dose proud it. kinda feel like superpowers now. going need start packing pounds get vaccine? plateau?

Cases deaths still going down. unfortunate side affect science unknowns known proven false true. Nobody knows vaccinated people carriers much vaccines stop severe cases Wow, that's ignorant BS. That's big yikerinos me, pupper. majority Germans (people general, really) little empathy fellow human beans. Wear mask. Stay fuck home. article never claimed research fully funded, completed, product ready human testing. wonder going change DNA, might well throw upgrades! someone poor you, expect kind response. You’re NZ?

It’s crazy guys want vaccine much little exposure virus. mean that’s amazing states people seem need experience death immediate family even start think virus real. why? vaccines 100 percent deaths variants far problem studies shown runners spread virus due heavy breathing, normally try pull mask pass others pull back away. knows good that, not. Lol. Zing! embraces support said group he'd gladly take vaccine. However made sure hide it, ardent antivax supporters accuse part medical deep state. Sorry,

i mean differences types Vaccines!

When talk Friends many scared mRNA Type.

There much Information “normal People”, Pharma-lobby, biased Media critical People objectivity! define occupational safety health bullshit? Change new cases per day rate rate infection. Double derivative. New cases per day rate infection.

Your equivalent would be, ""but officer, stop went 0 70, why'd pull 90? That's change 20 vs 70!?!?"" still get it.

This US consistently terrible leadership. many people believe obvious bullshit. people ever tire trying put negative spin anything remotely related China Russia? makes feel little bit better Wegmans still family owned..but yea hard resist speedy shipping ... \*sigh\* Compared Donny stable genius, deranged, lunatic boy, yes, perfect image mental clarity. Yea, go running sometimes (if call trying get back shape lol) pull mask pass others. mask even little bit breathing heavy sucks. Good. babies born Spanish Flu shorter born after. Maybe! Alternative take, maybe intentionally conservative/safe folks half-ass suggestions, still land somewhere middle? Children 50x likely die car accident COVID. India provided 56 lakh doses coronavirus vaccines grants assistance number countries. 

We need 100 times many doses ""save world"". ... don’t want die...?

They’re able deliver services without person. 

Teachers =/= medical personnel. didn’t sign this. Jesus Christ empathy people. people really want learn lessons hard way. guess can, long don’t put rest us danger. I’m vaccinated, won’t care. “oh can’t predict everybody live lives again” crap going wear thin.

This technically corruption science. ""I dont' know"" valid answer, little common sense tell ""not much longer"". Please get fact take it. get back living life. surprised rambling stuff? talking pork? chances US Covid death toll exceeds 600K? That's want vaccine. Yeah hundreds thousands dying. 

My stupid anti vax laws changed minds real quick 2 cousins died. come extended family doesn’t change mind \- everybody liked - wonder types claim COVID 99.8% survival rate, yet vaccine 99.9999% survival rate insist simply toxic deadly take. Ah yes, Joe Biden, perfect image mental clarity. Yep, one cruises supposed happen on. good news one ships, Quantum Seas, sailing without single case three months Singapore. vaccines get figured out, nothing high hopes cruises. taking precautions, social distancing, masks, testing after, contact tracing multiple platforms. real test seeing far virus spreads ship precautions place.  Huh. protects gi tract transfer babies bloodstream. hate say it’s really looking like 6mo gonna get covid. Everything’s going open back soon there’s timeline infant vaccinations. sucks. West that’s seen baby bust pandemic? work CVS rollout one logistically challenging frustrating things I've dealt career, seeing numbers coming facilities really puts smile face.

**End Date:** Open Well, Fox News information period, I’d say doesn’t surprise me. Idk downvoted it’s literally true. actually go you’ll see people stuff obviously people indoor mask less parties whole time. I’m saying that’s good right certainly occurring Yeah, ocean already worse thanks Murdoch goons. anyone scheduled second dose little later standard timeline? clinic gave dose one week said scheduling Pfizer dose two 4 weeks (instead 3).

I read online CDC gave emergency approval 6 weeks second Pfizer dose delay absolutely needed. sometimes let imagination run away me...so keep worrying protection good something. 😣 also got moderna! never gotten flu shot, one parents spaced kids vaccines. really last year, came around. want over. I’m really careful, feel I’m probably good person get it. go peoples homes job. 

It helped know tons people gotten it. Idk live cases falling like rock, think it’s helping. People like act like catching COVID guarantees spend rest life lungs 20% capacity unable get bed convince people take COVID seriously. believe DPRK democratic?

It makes feel uncomfortable easy fool people using nice sounding names. covaxin vaccine seems like great advancement. Much improved efficacy, killed virus, stronger variant, safe children. Phase 3 data fda approval can’t come fast enough ignoring mutations som may bypass vaccine. thought front line Thank you. wear mask ten hours day hate it. wear people choice vast majority would wear mask. pandemic masks coming off. I've working pandemic, lifting weights mask def problem. cardio mask?? Pure torture, done cardio months lol Covid always exist. don’t understand vaccinating children achieve

It takes 'novel' novel coronavirus, 'novel' part thing makes dangerous. you’re turd knowingly put people risk you’re “tired it”. 

Wear mask others around. want one dose is. It’s pretty simple. goalposts constantly shifting entire time. reason restrictions palatable first place “flatten curve” hospitals didn’t get overrun. Reddit seems think goal eradication?? Get fuck outta here. I’m tired crying wolf. seems feel dramatic get people listen. aren’t listening. 

It’s going like everything else - something happens causes cases rise hospitals struggle , react. Ask professional athletes wearing masks games true. Well people refusing ""I need head line, I'll get later."" wonder moderna something similar. It’s kind sucky choice vaccine get. get get feel lucky got anything.   love kids dearly...but damned wife can’t wait drop grandmas maybe 2 nights. Crossing fingers summer lol pretty widely known best vaccine around 95% effective. means 1/20 people protected. surprising know 3 people work for. eligible moderna. heard second shot worse but...I know anyone personally gotten it. read online. healthy 33 year old I'm struggling whether get it. also...I'd like part solution here. Yeah failure focus air filtration vs capacity/shutting might turn huge blunder. already know Covid barely spreads outdoors it’s replicating inside. Reddit comments grades. down-votes. cherry-picking restrictive state that’s done worse restrictive states chosen permissive state that’s fared better permissive states. you’re mid 30s now, doubt politics going factor want try pandemic “officially over”. trump wins 2024, youre looking low 40s try kid? 

Yea ok. know it’s norm kid 40 older.. you’re considered high risk older get past age 35 really need stop polluting ocean like that... “If idiots keep smoking, you’ll get cancer die!” ...kk Still waiting, I’ve deployed overseas since vaccines approved. surprise. Basically everything affordable medicine related comes India. Looking current prescriptions, 90% Indian. ""just"" wants lockdowns? evidence that? me, could bad news? people know there's effective pill might take vaccine. sure commented even without reading WSJ. course writing shit Russian vaccine ok. live costal city tbh don’t expect mask mandate end anytime year. think we’ll maybe get 50% capacity large events (concerts, sporting events) that’s it. We’ll see. Helll baby, Texas Texas style Mask says governor. see reassurance less deadly strains asserted frequently, really understand based on.

A virus kills host spread poorly adapted, certainly. one quite low mortality rate (though still higher we'd prefer), deaths occur relatively late course illness relative peak communicability. see much evolutionary pressure novel coronavirus become benign. 

Also, trends emerge aggregate long time-spans. individual mutations may predominate short run random likely *more* deadly less so. variant deadly contagious easily possible, could easily take over, especially manage escape vaccine.  surprised. I'm teacher, teachers pretty ignorant. local teacher group I'm swears nobody return work like COVID eradicated kids vaccinated. Many want get vaccine, state seem want make mandatory them. Love job, can't say thought quitting times recently. Vaccinated people still carriers. become walking HEPA filter vaporizes contact. anything letting people walk around without mask gives Anti-mask, Anti-vaxx, Anti-American idiots another excuse circumvent common sense policies.  Congrats, live life take daily risks. Might well stay inactive forever don’t get brain aneurisms thanks appreciate help

However think sites like fair older folks lower classes without much Internet savvy.... fact makes angry sites like exist help people cut line. 

There waiting list ranking system people need. still don’t get issue mask.

Masks work cheap.

But wearing requires admitting risk serious consequences covid. requires admitting certain high profile twitter user fundamentally wrong misleading regarding frequent, public statements covid. regarded somewhat tacit acknowledgment ""Team Blue"" correct assessment issue.

That hugely unpopular thing admit two groups: (1) ""Team Red"" (2) Team ""both sides manipulated fear""    request wear mask go grocery store. really fucking problem you? Pity teach civic class disagree someone without spewing personal insults.   slight only! Sore arm like slight chills, noticed bc paying attention. second soon though, hear it’s worse. I’ve known many vaccinated wasn’t big deal anyone. whole time shutting fast food. 

India way less fat obesity biggest risk death Covid. Source supply now? would Mayor Turner **Houston** speak cities Mayor of? probably infected first two weeks shot. situation teachers become eligible vaccinations next week. schools set become fully open early April. teachers concerned able schedule vaccination enough advance meaningful immunity things open up. OP you’re wrong. Asshole. pandemic proved without doubt half humanity cannot trusted There’s also never RNA vaccine millions people taking it. saying, it’s hard compare conventional vaccines. opposite first, 30 seconds “research” said wear mask um “professionals” said would actually harm me. agenda here, everyone sucks. Sorry dead man wonder thing. He's adamant, almost one agrees him. definitely looking every piece data coming in, Chuck Todd today knows 3m vaccinations yesterday, seemed unphased unchanged opinion. fatigue real, see everywhere. People wearing crappy masks lot gaitors. Many think over. B117 problem. hope he's wrong, cases start rising might late stop big surge. I’m highly anxious live witn 2 people 65, downvotes disgusting imo. Really? point still know? mask help others yourself.

Go Joe! gO bIrDs Hepatitis B? sub flooded anti mask lunatics. one thing want end nonstop negativity, rah rah pro america despite failing every single metric 95 percent pandemic infuriating. Americans desperately need remember happened understand system is, needs change. Obviously enjoy mostly months forget pandemic showed country... cases declining, states reopening, 4 weeks reopened states look neighbors, IMO states still locked going justify restrictions remove them.

Cases really declining much right now, least significantly. mostly plateaued even increased slightly vs fourteen days ago. talking like early February actually early March. not? bizarre. Experts wrong time.

Also, Fauci overly conservative cautious optimism driving policy public perception. wants people keep guard up. Finally Thank you. Predictions life look like US June 1st? Bonnie Henry recommend glory holes? go eat restaurant. aren’t required vaccine that. No. Same, UberEats I've avoided eating long time forced meal plan college buy 1st year student.

Yeah meant in, ge ones 90%. agree Thank comment. Nothing Fauci's credit, exact tune singing like September 2020. Everyone (including myself) happy hugely reduced case numbers metrics, looked like maybe coming side thing. Fauci somberly insisted metrics still far high heading winter, could see huge resurgence virus get baseline down. Obviously, dead accurate. 

Presumably equally solid reasons saying he's saying now. problem see might realistic. think ""10,000 cases day"" goal realistic last fall, baseline may even realistic today time around either. positive especially consider start Feb reporting 1000+ daily deaths Yes, population sizes biggest missing info article. worry wave 300 103774 variant too.. It’s ok it’s local organic. Lol I’ll admit. I’m sure that’s intended insult missed mark it’s observational. wish took age approach. Like everyone 75 first, 65-74, 50-64, etc. tiered system confusing hell tbh. Oh look, reddit scientific expert here. wife pregnant chance get vaccinated work turned recommendation OB. hope vaccinated shortly gives birth. dunno, dem voter, always understood getting another 2000 600. dont know single person personally thought would. cases declining, states reopening, 4 weeks reopened states look neighbors, IMO states still locked going justify restrictions remove them. 

This unfathomable idea. Nationally loads states minimal restrictions, often bordering neighbors heavy restrictions similar case numbers. [This found ""Dining restaurants associated 0.9, 1.2, 1.1 percentage point increase case growth rate 41–60, 61 80 81 100 days, respectively, restrictions lifted."" state like Wisconsin, 1% difference amounts 7 cases per day. certain point ask benefits restrictions outweighs costs. Especially cases declining nationally due continuously increasing vaccination rate. There's real chance potential consequences easing restrictions never even realized vaccines cancel completely. eYe sToRm Vaccine available general public earlier may, course herd immunity need elderly general public vaccinated (about 70%). 3 million vaccinations day already passed 85 million shots administered. rest March April 54 days, maintain 3 million shots day, enough 162 million + 85 million already administered, 247 million total, enough 123.5 million receive 2 doses, 210 million eligible nearly 60%. signs point us able administer 3 million day relatively soon even conservative. looking numbers hard see vaccinating general public April here's want, plainly put find

""Conclusion physiochemical data show enhanced infectivity reduced neutralization polyclonal antibodies Brazilian variant SARS-CoV-2.""   frustrating one thing greatly helps vaccine hesitancy seeing people know get vaccinated. vaccine selfie I'm jealous helps one person become less hesitant getting vaccine, I'm it. reckon vaccination trends gonna continue. Got mine yesterday 26! Herd immunity happens different levels different infections. universal number. Hoping 2nd Pfizer dose goes. Getting coming Thursday. I’m excited little nervous. First dose arm soreness, relieved protection finally! Reddit phds told people would flock businesses soon opened! Great - willing agree 5% increase middle-class taxes times good again?

Because that's theory requires, really can't ways (ultra-low tax rates good years, government goodies bad years.) can't handwaive away 'someone else pay it'. Yup 2/3 people 65 vaccinated. 

Deaths going go almost zero. Serious cases decline super fast well. health care facilities danger, need restrictions nearly much did. drinks wine like tomorrow. course does. think they're stupid using every tactic available? Yeah can't stand statistics thrown around like this. inaccurate use definition ""fully vaccinated"", can't use statistic without knowing size populations we're comparing! have, say, 5% fully vaccinated population responsible 3% hospitalizations, much less impressive effectiveness than, say, equal number fully vaccinated unvaccinated. Also, infections diagnoses occur? Probably many infections occurred Covid exposure second shot. 100% chance death this. babe, 4PM, time daily demoralization

Sometimes wonder whether journalists misanthropic psychopaths get spreading misery. US troll farms educated employed recent college grads posting nonsense FB Reddit day? social media operations belt. Fuck trying take vaccine someone actually needs it. Wrong.

You're describing unemployment. U.S. **too.** stimulus checks **on top that**. Highest rate infection early November. at? states, isn’t significant restrictions. Restaurants open. Bars many places open. Cinemas open. isn’t ban public gatherings. Outside wearing mask, lower capacity...what want can’t? Good lord. I’m glad able that! got first dose last Wednesday. sister teacher scheduled next Wednesday. We’re priority groups know 65+ age group people still haven’t gotten county. They’re good job trying best it’s still difficult due sheer volume people they’re needing process. joking, right?

Do know many trillions dollars relief provided prior this? Violently buried yeah.... doubt element, I'd shocked real capability anything it. time every willing adult vaccinated May/June, I'm guessing overwhelming public pressure return life normal. Many people, including myself, resisting urge now, really yet point that's right thing do. given couple months vaccination rate, increasing rate? I'm going feel differently June. Nah. can’t variant named you, don’t bother genetically test anyone! never said anything giving schools money dummy. said onset money available schools cares act yet spent due schools shut covid restrictions.

And quote: 

""These schools remain closed though. So, **why funding** exactly they’re still closed prior funds haven’t spent."" 


That bold part problem. funding goes schools already opened spent first package already, vast majority. vast majority schools underfunded stretched thin, pandemic deal with. That's funding for. 

&amp;#x200B;

REfreshing take second think it, huh? hope vaccinated staff first. parties decades. troll! It’s time home-grown government sponsored hackers bit damage Russia’s telecommunications assets. happens u lie say u asthma high blood pressure u get vaccine early.

You told he's acting like child, said x acting like child, *acts like child* (implying previous behavior reasonable... missed that...)

Then quoted *acts like child* said proves point. mean, technically yes did, prove point

If tell someone they're wrong double can't take evidence right lol recombinant vaccine - difference, no? Wow dumb mean get matter COVID Mutates point making vaccines useless pretty much back step 1 Pretty much everyone family ahead eligibility regardless live. Meanwhile PA still Phase 1A keeps putting people group saying won’t 1B till summer. sub group studied? correct. left individual communities towns make rules. also explicitly stated couldn’t enforce statewide ban. Lol getting downvoted lying Thank 🙏 number people manipulated persuaded various strategies increasing. Strategized. yet wasn't, week ago. Comment removed political? Lol. Let’s try again...

It’s already there! Scary thing is, lot seem organic way. in, societal pressure peers question anything. Rather paid agents.

People suddenly grouped “anti-vax/anti science/covid denier/DJT supporter/racist” want science done gene therapy sold vaccine. Sincere question, listen (even least somewhat) even them? Laughing hysterically Montreal . 55% Canadian cases first wave, around here. One year later.......the curfew last another ""few""weeks 😳🙄 even little true. bold part problem.

My comment way states implies giving schools funding. clearly states funding still available cares act yet spent. Funding reason schools shut down. vast majority schools already opened spent first package already. 

So, schools shutdown due lack funding tried vast majority schools underfunded stretched thin, pandemic deal with. That’s funding for.

Correct, schools closed due lack funding tried claim. They’re shut due covid restrictions funding can’t used till restrictions lifted students return school. 70% higher end calculations tho since herd immunity largely affected rate spread. range see corona, herd immunity threshold somewhere 60 75% Hey man, go get money? split isn’t republican democrat. 

I know way young adults hate mask mandates party city campuses without masks older people. 

And young people basically entirety far left. I’m defending her, shouldn’t gone work, there’s almost certain chance facility forced nurse come work. lot places evil administration  time AZ mass distributed here, supply problem recently started working nursing home zero cases entire pandemic. almost staff vaccinated long term residents vaccinated. residents got second dose, one CNA test positive contact basically every resident. went complete lockdown two weeks nobody tested positive. couldn’t fucking believe it. last place worked at, time staff member tested positive bunch residents too. vaccine  I'm assuming many restrictions lifted cases deaths go vaccinations go up, I'm assuming mask mandates still around many states businesses (although compliance may go down). No, not. Name another new government-backed program 1/3 country goal ahead schedule meet Lol right. Texas removed mask restriction next month idiots would still crying it. even 60+, let’s open up.

At least, think front line grocery workers essential workers get regardless age. people likely come contact someone infected even potentially spread, would make sense. started cruise ships, figured must air whole ship got it, researched n95 masks learned fact stupid wear properly would surely lul complacency die. You’re annoying little shit aren’t you? You’re idiot trying sound smart. skepticism established evolutionary science isn’t argument. 
You’re right I’m virologist I’m medicinal chemist. ‘working biotech’? hes waiting shot get back work, I'd say go it. 

Everything going open every one 3-4 weeks anyways read SA variant worse UK terms spread. Glad see people enjoy life get it. Efficacy first dose pretty high. guessing like people exposed extreme viral losd compromised immune systems one reason another. so, unspeakably mad. many others sacrificed much last year try beat thing keep loved ones safe, we’re CLOSE making worth it, assholes going ruin rest us gathering large numbers helping evolution vaccine resistant variant we’re going start square one. Selfish, shortsighted assholes. South Africa supposedly worse variant UK. I'm US thank information. i'll tell ask doc test suck food holes mask. Like everyone study apparently otherwise much difference groups. even fines wearing masks places. one going jail 80 percent americans vaccinated wearing mask. understand post meant sarcasm, fear paranoia really. said: yeah. Please wear mask untill actually clear. Yep! much Republicans “pro-life” idea what's going south africa. get regular updates UK since many family members live there.

How Europe? open South Carolina. Since August. US almost 40k hospitalizations! Hospitalizations dropping like crazy CA, state less hospital Texas NY. Things really looking brighter. get. the. vaccine. Obviously coming place privilege US

You don’t need qualify say disparaging “privilege”  long get historical low 28K hospitalizations? End month? don’t think we’ll required wear masks anymore, outside handful major cities. That's cause watch capeshit. get wrong, I'm trying talk bad getting vaccined. i'm really happy get mine important know go work old people. that's reason test. co-worker antibodys, test. worst wjat could happened big part vaccined people think everything ok ain't ok. 

and ones i'm anti-vaxer one people think *just* flu told scared situation could happened people think save spread virus around anymore south africa? Jesus guys nothing... it’s crystals power within them! think learned like first month covid Yeah wait two weeks........oh nvm elaborate u/suitcaseismyhome said: Shops closed means shops including clothing, hardware dollar stores… since early December. Masks mandatory central districts towns obviously supermarkets public transport.

I'm cautious person safe reopen schools, let people buy t-shirt offline. number customers stores stay limited everyone keep wearing medical (not cloth!) masks. 

Other restrictions public selling consumption alcohol, meet-ups 5 ppl, libraries museums, prostitution, visits nursing homes without negative test, fitness studios closed tourism (hotels camping grounds). stupid. read full protection vintners increase 56th day. Exactly, literally sitting nothing. feel mask 5 minutes.

The bigger question would want watch movie without popcorn. would’ve kept divisive, racist, budding terrorist office $600 don’t think voting. Like doesn’t embarrass said loud? place atroturfed paid agents push agendas. Nothing feels organic around here. People fucking thinking themselves.

I'm glad still make comment. Unfortunately, banned soon ""wrong think"" seems direction things going. Yes. locked down. funny say that. team lockdown sure. Actually spent time obsessing JANUARY. wife family thought losing mind. 

I'm saying take Texas approach. think there's gonna crazy 4th wave, due variants, media right want you. We're way this, regardless dipshits wear mask. see upset empathize. I'm sick feeling safe go restaurants, movie theaters, etc. things likely back ""normal"" fall, maybe even late summer. We've made far, might well throw year's worth sacrifices window removing reasonable precautions, like wearing masks, soon. Yes have. media done good job haha. Thanks understanding. Fauci unacceptable. Roanoke? look Brazil Europe real world data months? 

Also, thousands thousands problems. It’s pushed cnn constant counter. guy invented one first antibody tests say Could clear words? Yes.

Does mean lying manipulating? No. Supply eventually stop problem, right now, March 7, still problem. think life outside California New York going look relatively normal. I’m banking Vegas night clubs open Memorial Day weekend. Even California expect compliance be... low. Nah, one take one someone else give Yeah there's Dallas, San Antonio, Galveston, Fort Worth, counties speak message Mayor Turner. Australia made massive sacrifices lockdowns Victoria state/district world eradicated second wave, severe prolonged restrictions great financial psychological cost. Australia shouldn’t penalised low numbers I’ve said usually get downvoted oblivion. 

But makes skeptical I’m even “allowed” question long term effects experimental vaccine. 

Because you’re “anti-science” want science? 

Nothing makes sense anymore.... remember virus overblown last year? ever take cautious approach? thing gets control, spreads like wild fire. reason australia new zealand gone strict lockdowns several cases. I'm saying best approach, important take seriously. 

I really understand rush reopen dangerous things stop mask mandates everyone us vaccinated summer. 

Certain things reopen hit certain vaccination thresholds. look graph/numbers? asking. drop steeper US. [Macedonia naming Good luck that.. it’s human condition. got bigger fish fry. Lebron James, influential person black community said he’s sure he’ll get vaccine big impact black community risk. I've holding weaning (1 year old) child get vaccinated. Breastfeeding hard validates decision, least part, keep trucking. I'm thankful state rescinded mask mandate go back living normal life still waiting, family, coworkers, friends. Nobody work received vaccine yet. registered month, hunting schedule luck. anyone else tired reading hearing “....but....”, especially warnings never come true? keep hearing “but...” right around April 30. rule thumb person wearing mask, I'll wear one too. want make anyone nervous.

Although, gotta say, gas station attendants increasingly wearing (in NJ). know they're outside bothers little. keep mine on. Yeah, Wait Two Weeks(tm). mention go back work 8 weeks later put baby daycare get sick continuously, yeah, I’d hold year too. face covering reduced participants’ ability perform vigorous exercise 10%, probably found slightly harder breathe mask, according paper published European Respiratory Journal. “This reduction modest and, crucially, suggest risk healthy people exercise face mask, even working highest capacity,” said Dr Massimo Mapelli, cardiologist CCM. Prof Sam Bayat, physiologist Grenoble University hospital, involved research, said: “Although results preliminary need confirmed larger groups people, seem suggest face masks also worn safely indoor sports fitness activities, tolerable impact performance.” Yeah hate think makes seem enlightened something. Performative BS. It’s ugly. tested positive. vaccine group likely 3-4 weeks. supposed wait certain amount time past 10-day isolation period get vaccine? Vaccines always way hell many people getting vaccinated, 74 year old mom PA can't even get wait list?  lost husband year, severe anxiety health problems, can't even drive failing vision issues. Yeah, great numbers going down, think system gets vaccinated first fair older people need most. sure tell Bill Gates's private ninja army sneak home immunize sleep. Better find til 3rd shot. ignore sort secondary effects like, say, screwing millions kids real school year, sure, it’s great solution. 

I also hear holding breath time never breathing also reduces spread Covid. Thats new theory. speculation, possible. 

For scare outside world go full lockdown shoot foot. 

Cant really go deeper knowing automod strike write anything more.  thing America literally founded aversion authority, even authority could help. still get staph, botulism, probably e coli, coronavirus Exactly. see huge dip vaccinations week, too. I'm 2+ weeks Pfizer #2 dad Covid month ago. came help install stuff today, wow feel strange nice finally see without mask. guess we'll dinner next week! Like I'm obviously trying brag weird able things like now. Lol what? wear kn95 mask time public outdoors, keep spare pocket reason, especially cold know condensation form inside mask. clearly tried it. go sporting event next month. could go bar restaurant tonight really wanted to. small business back open since May busier year. Thanks contributing question though Also keep mind mid Feb major winter storm half country. made following week seem like increase comparatively. Shops whole foods gets atleast one Amazon delivery week. 

Fuck try support local still end wegmans (no whole foods around here) get atleast one delivery week Amazon/Walmart/etc. No, clinical trial using mRNA technology prove safe. fucking article. doesn’t matter treat cancer treat virus buffoon.

*To please regulators would ultimately greenlight clinical trials, Moderna show drug still safe dose 10 times higher what’s needed treat disease—something new paper doesn’t demonstrate, says geneticist Michael Heartlein, chief technical officer competing mRNA company Translate Bio Cambridge.*

I’ll get viral vector / adenovirus vaccine day week. next month, expect expand nationally, one degree another. 50+ able get vaccinated majority States April. say that? Yeah easily best tracking site I've found. idea site use instead? Exibit

The ironing  Pfizer looking 6 month booster, I’m trial. think it’ll increase efficacy least 10 fold remove decrease efficacy variants. It’s basically third injection, dosage first 2. Honestly know going about. contract tracing quarantine measures joke work. One staff (who already Covid) popped positive PCR test, likely false positive. sent home colleague two weeks, fully vaccinated. SMH Hot take rabbit hole. saying mask wearing become permanent? Fuck no. Thank you. (We're US) won’t disagree that. Agree! Hurry. Up. I’ll damned I’ll continue wearing mask protect 15%... FWIW, know someone 30s NYC got doses January (health care worker, preexisting conditions) diagnosed covid week. hospitalized usually horrible symptoms. lying saying need even hopes convince people edge get it?

Hard know known liar telling something. basic, know people like guy can't comprehend this. already staying home nothing, stay home nothing virtue-signaling “heroes” Ok Need help . recently returned office real bad stuffy nose /slightly hard breathe times mask. suggestion buy eg humidifier yes spec look for? It’s really government program. hitting 1,000,000 day even took office anybody believe anything comes Russia China? 

It seems disinformation/propaganda campaigns, credibility country goes down.  
Now whenever see anything social media taking Russia China's side, brain automatically thinks 'propaganda troll'. reflex point. 
I'm sure could stuff that's actually true, spew pure BS time, even things say true start sound like BS. Sorry hard year you. alone. it’s great conspiracy theorist, it’s clear “research” might benefit better sources, pandemic immense costs people every country, obviously certain policies actions dramatic impact downstream consequences. US highest recorded death rate COVID per capita world, clear differences policies results peer countries, one salient basic facts pandemic. research shown this, demonstrates clear bias, would concordant fact somehow thought ok go bars “defiance lockdowns” - basic policies depended work limited time, among else. Yes, obviously cause pandemic, tell didn’t kill anyone’s grandma want, even actions - aggregate contributed pandemic perpetuating - things keep conditions worse, making businesses suffer more, resulting unemployment etc, would think could empathize enough thought twice behavior.

You right shaming people individually won’t help, people definitely feel ashamed going bars “defiance” stated policies. completely agree far blame must directed towards governments. family members countries living similar restrictions, vaccinated reopen fully, least vastly lower case rates fearful lives extent many still be. Somehow, fact can’t connect complete federal inaction 1 year, 500,000+ deaths, data show even wearing masks would brought number lower hundreds thousands (nothing say actual policy response government support people like financially impacted) makes even less sympathetic original post. open today, I’m wrong wear masks they're required. chastise people follow guidelines. respect decisions people want leave homes potentially exposed COVID. I'm exactly 90% Americans since last summer, socializing close friends family private. I’m really thinking vaccine rollouts coupled less testing/demand testing next months mushy data wise. 

And much bigger baseline cases time around seems like virtually every regional spike since thing started wasn’t extremely evident till 61/2- 8 weeks everyone got pushed indoors. got going noticeable bumps things like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years unless area strongly downslope seemed soften bumps. Capacity distancing measures used possible transmission simply can't avoided. Wearing mask distancing absolutely mean 100% safe covid. 

This late game people *still* understanding completely dumfounding.. lazy virulent Let guess, diplomat.

“after weeks steep declines, progress slowed nationally cities backsliding. New York City Miami areas seen persistently high case likely he's not.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nope, upticks, depending states Yeah, agree. majority adults initiating end March. Maybe somehow count already infected population that's hard accurately. Yes many people sub hate Fauci routinely think know better him. convinced intentionally lies likes attention control conspiracy theory bs. hospitalized patients survive: probably right there's number long term hospitalizations date case numbers higher months ago well shorter term recent hospitalizations I'm sure that's enough assume people hospital right die. article says one last pic turned away others official form ( state says have) becoming strict letting ineligible people. Good site. I’ve gone drive throughs throughout whole pandemic, consider someone takes coronavirus seriously. you’ll fine go. doubt virus spread drive windows, studies shown coronavirus doesn’t spread much surfaces, don’t think get touching food. well go get food. choice working day it, would choose?

It's rocket science folks..  Makes sense. pandemic made wish could fewer children too... guys distinguish hurd immunity heard immunity, well herd immunity.  Close 70% don’t count Palestinians non-approved cancer treatment 2017 you’re getting covid vaccine? even mentioned article tweaked formula reduced toxicity mice. mice followed several weeks signs toxicity, Moderna similar results nonhuman primate studies plan publish soon, says. Well customers *need* see movies, anyone earns living production movies sure think know what'll cave first.. Sure I’m saying there’s valid reason vaccinate kids even though majority make fine there’s still possibility severe illness potentially permanent organ damage. 67 70 percent still seems pretty high. idiocy truly astounding...EVEN one accept 'official' narrative, germ theory, et al... NAC ton things yes it’s antioxidant balances GABA/ glutamate prevent excessive activation NMDA receptors that’s root cause excitoxicity. excitoxic inflammation needs treated treat certain forms CFS autoimmune disorders. I’d recommend experimenting supplements recommended plus mega-dosing magnesium glycinate. always throw too: eating lot kimchi around time recovered. Oh ya? choice wearing 10hrs day wearing 10hrs day, would pick?

It's rocket science blazza AZ already here. bought advance part warp speed. sitting around warehouses waiting emergency approval. going use IMO stupid makes worse giving away. Well, yeah. People terrified go hospitals, putting pregnancy absolutely makes sense. Hospitals overrun covid patients, people alone one person, you’d go labor mask, worry brand new baby would get covid. wouldn’t scary now, it’s still ideal. nurse going work negligent horrifying act... nurse whoever responsible ought punished unnecessary. can't speak legal situation may country suspect lawsuit may difficult would need prepared possibly lengthy battle unless nurse admits done case may good chance. 

I wishing best future. may right, may wrong. like 90% post history covid denying subs makes sense anti masker. wear bc (at gym classes) totally sucks can’t wait it’s required (I vaccinated) Okay first all, actions individual going turn tide pandemic. kill anyone's grandma going bar 3 times since last March, stayed home, nothing would changed. Shaming people flouting guidelines going make comply, US government authority enforce real lockdown like oned New Zealand Australia.

I multiple nurses teachers family underworked unhappy restrictions. One relatives owns bar brink bankruptcy. lost job due company losing much business due pandemic. I've developed anxiety, drinking problem, depression, lost years progress made toward combatting social anxiety depression issues I've dealt prior pandemic. I've given year life pandemic. year weekends spent home alone playing video games browsing Reddit. I'm even close ""worst-off"" pandemic. I'm going go bankrupt due unemployment, even without federal state aid. kids. I'm teenager deprived in-person education.

And icing shit cake look states countries aggressively locked down, compare states countries lock all, literally can't find evidence suggesting anything short full-blown lockdown (where police arrest leave house) would drastically changed anything. debate 500,000 dead Americans zero. debate 500,000 dead Americans potentially bit less 500,000 dead Americans.

I'm providing beef whole pandemic. I'm conspiracy theorist thinks virus created Chinese government. I'm going get vaccine continue wear masks required get it. I'm upset whole handling virus much divided world, accomplish goal honestly can't even tell succeeded measurable degree. Everyone SC selfish prick like you? appreciate reply never worried taking vaccine du jour.

When kid early 50s never polio vaccine. find mom told teenager. scared much made sure got every vax, flu shot, shingles, pneumonia, tetnus shot available got older.

Look bright side. mRNA vax takes sufficient amount people may help solve immigration issues. people needed.

Just consider opposite non-mask wearing anti-vax crowd.

I hope decide take vax choice. 

I know live live PA. town SW PA 27 children rare cancer believed come Mon River supplies water 300,000 PA due fracking waste. wish situations got attention nuances vax side effects.

Take care. mean expensive tickets food, shitty seats, inconsiderate movie goers. know filthy minimum wage staff ""cleans"" - fuck would want go back?

I'll stream free comfort home, thanks. youre fine. dont stress CovidTracking.com officially stop collecting data today. Shame. used site check many people hospitalized. Right it’s 40,212. safe assume going die? likely hospitalized since January before. Nothing's gonna last, current situation particularly untenable.

We ClassicStrain something like R=0.8-1 that's dropping prevalence steadily. also B.1.1.7 (UK) something like R=1.2-1.4 that's growing dramatically. Combine two get semi flat (I'm pretty sure still dropping today's cases, aka ~2 weeks ago).

Project forward far get back dramatic exponential growth B.1.1.7 flying away ClassicStrain disappearing. counter also vaccinations warmer weather coming. counter *that*, also large portion country deciding pandemic going partying.

B.1.1.7 responds well vaccinations, drop 1.2-1.4 back 1 take 17-30% remaining unvaccinated population vaccinated - that's gotta weeks away. less weeks it'll take start causing problems? knows.

The real problem antibodies B.1.1.7 seem work well ClassicStrain B.1.351 (SA), even though antibodies strains work well B.1.1.7. everyone catches B.1.1.7 still needs vaccinated catch second strain.

And yet, fully clear another surge B.1.1.7 would problem, there's high chance would. course big fear hospitals getting overwhelmed, seems unlikely - hard sure. demographics unvaccinated population they're less likely need hospitalization, also much shorter hospital stays better outcomes. actually seen action yet: Colorado, hospitalization rate (hospitalizations/cases) remains steady 4-5%, CFR (deaths/cases) dropped 1.5% early December hospitals strained 1.0%, looks like staying steady there. 1.0% mortality rate (or 0.4% account missing cases) would certainly problematic. could get 0.1%, like people claim flu has, could another wave 100 million infections another 100k deaths. course, deaths come among young healthy people, great.

The stakes much lower months ago, uncertainty all-time high. literally nothing Dating apps worst cancer humanity wver created. literal hell dudes. feel many vaccine doubters wanted make political statement polls SM. comes crunch they’ll take it’s available. What's latest real world data vaccine effectiveness? Namely Pfizer Moderna? Yeah. go gym every day, days fine, days sweat usual mask gets real damp impossible breathe mask keeps sticking face.

Then give go home. actually hallucinated tamiflu once. you’ve ever heard felt like DPH DXM. well Spaniards lot children though? would mostly blame “me culture” people value freedom/comfort far much children one kid. ancestors far kids far less resources average Spaniard. 1.275m 7 day rolling average, including J&amp;J (J&amp;j isnt cdc site yet reason).

J&amp;J said deliver 20 million month, 4 million week .571m day.

So likely already 1.6m+ :) thats think safe guess.  4x many according CDC doubt we're going see ""Masks required"" ""No masks required"" stores. I'm interested see economic forces decide profitable route take. people could decide prefer comfort convenience wearing mask sensation seeing people's face choose stores cater that, people could decide prefer feeling safety comes wearing mask choose stores cater that.

If turns one vastly preferred businesses actively losing gaining money based choose, think businesses tip profitable route. think ultimately people point, especially local, smaller businesses. I'm interested see massive, nationwide chains like Walmart Target look Texas early study requiring face masks irrespective government mandates impacts financially. We're watching culture around masks change dramatically short amount times, Abbott's decision. EU already vaccinated 9.1% people first dose

How so? That's figure Denmark one best EU. seen stats US lately? number absolutely something beneficial Nice username, fuck cesspool. Destroyed economy exactly? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  i'm willing bet lot like trump, getting vaccine secret  “There activities fully vaccinated people begin resume privacy homes.”

Lol! Wut? vaccines prevent severe symptoms 100% Yeah odd. 

I'll post opinion threads here. One thread get tons upvotes, thread get downvoted oblivion. guess safe thing post article commentary. see paste comment like 10 times day, it’s good research, thing always bothers refer wealthy people buying spots line “super smart” somehow know smart lmao. Wealthy people paying things doesn’t imply smart.

Also fact link links Reddit comments bit funny lol. Like “there thing long term side effect” links reddit comment random reddit claiming immunologist who’s comment says “google half life mRNA”

That’s really scientific journal-worthy explanation. People worried climate change decades. become problem overnight world suddenly come end overnight. interventions done slow climate change and/or adapt it.  responding comment Brazil's president responsible crime humanity? topic? Listen, anyone going talking headhunting crimes humanity Covid...all I'm saying is, China first name docket. Allow proper full investigation, maybe I'll start believe otherwise. hope doesn’t lead decreased mask usage

The bigger problem vaccine hesitancy, due ""nothing change"" getting vaccine. people get vaccines due new guidance, people start taking masks minimize spread reduce lowest possible level. reducing certain threshold. 

Minimizing spread not, never be, goal covid mitigation policies. Traveling visiting countries tried helps make cultured baby boy Saying Brazil's president blame mean nobody else is. I'm thrilled stimulus package dark side simple. notably extended unemployment benefits. benefits stay breaking point people need go back work go hungry. key unemployment rate going down. people holding trying find work benefits serious issue. Unemployment ""runs out"" individual basis people required work period time eligible again. can't get back work people need resort extremes feed families. unemployment benefits running out, go ~700 week whatever individuals receiving current 300-400 bonus 0 unemployment exhausted. number first doses / day now? data see total number shots, around 2.2M. Texas. DFW area US here. 65+ parents can't get vaccine appointment June. can't get one later. going awhile country done vaccinating I'm going say 4 million day since already getting close 3 million day. think peak around 5 million day late April. Yep, good points. would never claim eradicate disease like covid, explaining eradication possible. I’ve known didn’t want children young age, I’m 30’s even cemented choice. planet falling apart. pfizer ones canada waiting germany I'm pretty sure. honestly prepped much worse this. great news, almost made cry. Finally got first jab today FEMA site Florida (I tech university). felt surreal. excited path now. There’s thing, let’s say Person 1 thread says he/she’s fully vaccinated, person 2 says person 1 he/she doesn’t need masks person 1’s gonna meet low risk person friend relative (assuming low risk), mods, say, removed comment trying spread misinformation, person 2 cite CDC. next episode: Water wet! YEEEEHAWWW!!! def good news headline ‘diagnosed with’ ‘confirmed cases’ it. Agreed. I'm saying headline useful information. Yep. I'm perfectly ok sick dog 2 weeks means hospitalization death. Death really tendency ruin day. people detroit still go county sites get JJ want it. hell go kroger/publix/etc/etc get want. echo here? Seems like cool article title like almost every day ... like it. now. We're vaccinating 60x people per day new confirmed cases Wow, big. I’m happy see this. hope doesn’t lead decreased mask usage (despite fact recommendation explicitly states vaccinated people continue wearing social distancing public) logical perspective, that’s hard concept push anything “encourage others wear masks too” perspective. Yes, especially northeast. even enough testing supplies test everyone symptomatic beginning pandemic Id actually perfectly fine state giving fuck me. Leave alone, bother me, wont bother you, good day too.

But right now? allowed go out? Nah. allowed fulfil life desire? Nah. allowed do? work pay taxes, basically demanded buy groceries per week bare necessities. district. Travelling different district? Banned. 

All told turn vaccine summer. Maybe. get sooner? buy one? No. state usurped itself. keep tight leash. ok replace CDC government. enough non-answers 7 day rolling average round 1.6-1.7 million first (or only) doses.

Don't focus much total vaccinated, 2nd dose shots limited past, future. actually see slight decrease 2nd dose shots hit 3-4 weeks time saw decrease first dose shots due storm. Thats reflection things going now. I’m anti-Trump come first US vaccine approval early/mid December remember correctly. 

The US fell short 20 million 2021 goal independent president was. That's fair point. least live, schedule 2nd dose get first. That's efficient. know UK ... longer wait folks get 1st shot quicker.

I suppose things looking ""fairly normal"" maybe 2nd dose may necessary (we know yet). able lift public restrictions everyone opportunity fully vaccinated. happen June so. I know some countries have a history of fudging their numbers on things, **but I also know that international statisticians and data modelers are accustomed to that, and are able to make some pretty good models with unreliable or incomplete data.**

Statistician here. broad statement it’s hard really discuss, truth it’s really hard make “good” model unreliable data. countries this? eligable it, that's really concern yet.

However, available you, get it. Talk doctor it, signs people infection cleared may need one dose mRNA vaccine. would unconscionable ask teachers risk lives teach.

As opposed people working essential jobs entire pandemic?

Painting teachers classrooms without vaccinations kind martyrs real BS completely disrespects people working essential services.    Wow, big. I’m happy see this. hope doesn’t lead decreased mask usage (despite fact recommendation explicitly states continue wearing social distancing public) logical perspective, that’s hard concept push anything “encourage others wear masks too” perspective. You’re vaccinated dude. Stop worrying live little. can't mossad assad, sorry Well New Zealand Canada ordered far need - makes sense donate leftovers. New Zealand may talk bit delaying rollout don’t think anyone New Zealand seriously thinking 6 month year long delay vaccination let Brazil get allocation. covid 2 weeks ago good quite tho right? want take vaccine dose someone else needs That’s CDC Still keeping prediction masks hitting bonfires trash cans middle finger salutes nightmare Memorial Day.  Totally it’s cute! agree always soon people. people risk-adverse people traumatized experience. right think logically objectively soon, many adults, including higher risk people isolating entire year, yet able get vaccine. clear goals yet met. Budtenders might make sense dealing medical MJ, since somewhat like pharmacist, weed CDC recommendations bearing liability! might top-up fuel car, top-up credit prepay phone account, better yet topping glass wine. adding restoring something level required. essentially perfect comes preventing gravest outcomes 

I’m glad people realizing this, hopefully apply logic think variants ‘risk’ pose vaccines. 

I.e., instead focusing reduction neutralizing antibodies- focusing well vaccine prevents death &amp; hospitalizations vs new variants. realistic # people vaccinated per day US end March? don’t understand what’s confusing you. You’re vaccinated, nothing worry about. staff vaccinated think rules end, since legal liability end oh ya missed that, tbh didnt read well enough, still tho dont know able determine much mask mandates slowed growth unless control compare to. I'm guessing missed live Kansas City, governor (Kansas, Missouri), changed allot vaccines direct urban areas. Even getting small number, rural counties find enough people vaccinate cities moving snails pace. 



Seems like easy decision. “One cable ""was warning shot,” U.S. official said, according book. “They begging people pay attention going on.”

One cable writers told Rogin messages meant warn potential public health disaster relating lab.” guidance tells wear mask follow local health guidance engaging public activities. resume going theaters, restaurants, etc. within guidelines country/state/county allowed. Here's study *Nature* asymptomatic spread. paper, detection rate asymptomatic positive cases low, evidence transmission asymptomatic positive persons traced close says even fully vaccinated, that. Still wear masks safe distance public avoid large crowds. dad close 40 died early 70's. Got little time older son never met younger son.

You trying place monetary value kids many non-monetary factors consider. kids born people $60k stashed away burn they'll live fulfilling lives anyway. ""functioning""

Biden clearly good Covid team better messaging though. There’s nothing definitive I’m aware proving vaccinated people spread covid unvaccinated people. Less likely transmit, unable   CDC: ""OKAY MAKE SURE USING DENTAL DAM"" wish. Currently almost 4 million completely vaccinated (out 9 million) vaccines pretty badly still feel effects that, cases go down, slowly. also opening things requires vaccination (like restaurants movie theatres) Yes accurate. Still good news though. EU around 450 Million. received Johnson Johnson vaccine Saturday, rough Saturday night little sore Sunday awoke today side effects. 10/10 reccommend. Today March 8th. Cases dropping 7 day rolling average since Feb 25th.

The CDC **STILL** pinned tweet March 3rd claiming cases increasing. 

We need better CDC. Misinformation need right now. Post vaccination viral carriage rates frequently studied provide information. would expected Covid vaccinees capable contributing significant spread type study could quantify that.

Any links, preferably /r/COVID19 links relevant studies would greatly appreciated, include them! problem deliver promised. still 95 days left school year. done safely, needs happen. aren’t months disposable school high school. No, that's what's happening. cities high risk people unable vaccinated, rural counties many doses, already vaccinating healthy adults. Since people urban areas limited transportation capabilities, high risk people unable get available doses.

Not mention good old fashioned shenanigans going on. one contractor vaccinated right now, he's vaccinated aunt gave enough notice able get halfway across country get Texas going ""extra"" doses. January. know ""extra"" part bullshit could notify family. blame common sense public, would blame public health officials sacrificed public could buy masks medical workers.

It common sense start wearing mask told many months masks necessary buy masks. lies various health authorities masks sabotaged public health gave fringe groups time demonize masks, along trump, making uphill battle change public behavior. 100% get desire reopen business. 
 
But businesses re-open mask mandates. separate shut order capacity limitation. see anti-mask mandate pro-business stand. Meh. like truncates top end O2 intake top end limiter.  pointed wrong schools closed due lack funding along trying falsely claim said schools closed tried argue schools don’t need money. 

All show incorrect. kids fine. Live life mild sore throat three days don’t know. Maybe still catch colds. get mid April looking like nothing going change, young healthy person get vaccine?

I state matter profession: animal lacks self-preservation instinct, evolution takes care problem. young person cannot act best interests, is. fine, minority fine. That's called ""culling event"", even small. even small culling events forceful impacts gene pool.

To clear, expect end April things changing many, all, arenas public life. find whole debate kind silly. can't ""I got vaccine, need wait around vaccinated...aaaand we're good."" also choose person's face. Ur covid-idiot :) Kids generally extremely low risk, unless specific condition something otherwise need masks outdoors. face selfish!!! tested positive anti bodies 9 months covid. think reliable. admit horrible articulating thoughts, good know 👋👋 much anxiety trepidation due extreme caution messaging point. 

Totally. get degree! People want bring death people care about. That's important good news put CDC exists, luckily, vaccines really good news Wow, 5,000,000 people that’s soooooooooooooooooooooo much Sir, Wendy's. going happen. successfully eradicated one disease. We’ve gotten close Polio, helps one eliminated western countries anti vaccination movement isn’t airborne like Covid it’s harder reestablish gone. Based current rate 2-3 weeks. many people going get vaccinated. Eventually youll hit point people actively seek appointments drops low appointments wont getting filled. 

While might people qualify take vaccine, dont sign (lazyness, knowing appointments open, struggles getting vaccine place, etc). state either spend time reaching people, letting vaccines sit shelf, open everyone, get shots arms wait till May start getting reach group. Fun fact US less 5% world's population accounts 25% world's prison population Wow, technology nothing sniff at! one turn nose chance taking vaccine. Moderna sitting storage Germany. 680.000 doses received two weeks expected go 1.8 Million.

Q2: 6.4 Million
Q3: 26.7 Million  IMO, mask. mask anyway unless it’s super crowded would within 6 feet someone 10 seconds. Well yeah sounds like agree... vaccine prioritization isn’t need based prerequisites are:

- computer literate people people advocates like yourself

- people cars drive kinda far sometimes shot

- people enough time put work points

There’s also (in area least) lot people getting vaccinated thanks family connections, jumping line falsifying information (common one saying smoker) That's fine, goal 1.5M lowered 500k GGD? saying interested GGD vaccinations? Why? see care organization applies vaccine.  Im assuming kids fall low risk unvaccinated specifically mention vaccinated grandparents hugging unvaccinated grandchildren never going get seriously ill anyway.

They going die, *known* covid risks young person known risks vaccine.

You argue vaccine carriers ""unknown risks"" data 12 months, (no offense) sort speaks scientific illiteracy. describe simply *isn't vaccines work*. long term effects, effects show right away. hide woodwork years.

The exception *maybe* Guillan-Barre, reason think going problem here. Seems believe pretty low risk. buzzword change “equality” “equity”? shouldn’t work without vaccinated. did. That’s world works unfortunately. Thankfully healthcare professionals able work virtually. 

Teachers option work remotely shouldn’t somehow taken away workers didn’t luxury. Saw tweet called “Syringe” lol Yep legitimate point. kindof assumed lung damage covered J&amp;J's effectiveness limiting ""severe"" disease. right, probably know know point. smh.... even arguing about? one cares. still make effort least. 11-12 me. put individual low-risk group? virus affects everyone differently. 

The vaccine stop someone carrier. idea stop wearing mask meet unvaccinated individuals simply they're longer danger rather selfish. far willing drive? Consider vaccinespotter.org. make towards Tennessee South Carolina North Carolina, they’re really opening things up. definitions frontline workers vague. Make trip aJnJ one dose regimen can.

Splitting hairs here, know. birthday hug want give someone April. Haha. healthcare worker, I’ve vaccinated, parents 60’s 70’s almost fully vaccinated, haven’t hugged year. 

Why would need anyone approve hugging parents? Can't think yourself? ever cdc says NEW CDC GUIDELINES:

-fully vaccinated people continue wearing masks, practicing distancing washing hands often
-in gatherings fully vaccinated people unvaccinated people multiple households, everyone wear mask practice distancing people able choose J&amp;J Pfizer/Moderna? get get? I'm vaccinated I'm still wearing mask, 

Indoors places require understand, mask wearing *outside*, thanks. imagine see much less mask wearing outside coming weeks. seems like mask wearing outdoors signaling/optics many people, vaccines matter much I’m hearing lot budesonide it’s ability help people survive Covid. aren’t treatments like promoted routinely used medical community? It’s cheap, safe, widely available. second one 3 days turned 30. really bad, though really way energy me. 

But thought another one right now, 35 (I'd 36 arrived)? thank you. Waking 12, 2, 4, 5 rough 27 first... would brutal now.

That really want attending high school graduations I'm 55.  I'm even comfortable wearing shirt workouts. I'm sure hell wearing mask. course, I'll continue work home garage now.  think would unreasonable metric. Anymore? never did. start now. muh 5% public still need mask think concern long term effects though. Sure won’t die Covid J&amp;J vaccine, still suffer long term even permanent lung damage? likely occur vaccines, effective?

Not saying downplay Johnson Johnson vaccine, legitimate point. One issue low infection rate begin with. Lol, thanks. That's second one sarcastic ass! makes sense lmao

Series TV *same thing* Well there's that. Different variants. Different locations. talk press release. can't possibly know many people actually got it. people asymptomatic, develop lasting antibodies, people died causes never tested, etc. best confirmed+suspected cases assume missed every study assumes that. point point obvious? comments pretty much ""confirmed different actual "" CDC issue anything sort year. Exactly. can't even count amount posts daily thread I've seen along lines ""I got 2nd shot weeks ago, able visit parents got shots month ago?"" shows much anxiety trepidation due extreme caution messaging point. People would whine get lollipop someone else did. creating population spoiled brats. least one people I'm thinking one closest friends pre pandemic. brunch together almost every week told everything. I'm sure seeing one else told such. admitted germaphobic pre pandemic ""I know I'm might irrational,"" ""I'm comfortable anything different.""

For people I'm less close pre pandemic, assume want see /me/ seeing people. I'm sure least 1-2 people literally seeing one. Congrats!!! thank helping us all. Cries Czech. Yes headline wrong. article reasonable headline wrong essentially say article. that’s peak modern day reporting don’t know is. keeping around indefinitely

Bad faith argument alert. foreign government wanting fuck America even more...what would post Reddit? This. would post this.  selfish thenn Maybe entire population yes, everywhere groups people have. Might 1% there. live SC I’ve barely done shit year. I’m pretty surprised CDC claiming vaccinated individuals probably safely visit low risk non vaccinated family members. based new data regarding carrier transmission? intellectual response imagine gets though? late. I've convinced already!!!  I'm even sure trying say anymore. Take time internet. I'm afraid ask, what's point, ""ogpepe""? Reddit weird. genuinely think lot people site think monetary policy joke doesn’t matter. Cancel student debt, forgive mortgage debt, cancel rent, give everyone $5,000 month rest year, etc. Oh shut everything you’re it.

I’m convinced lot people site living shut-in lifestyle pandemic getting enjoyment doom gloom keeping everyone locked down. Consequences damned. Me. Don’t want give much info, took eligible loved one scheduled appointment pharmacist said extra going waste got one well.  30% people COVID-19 experience symptoms 9 months situation wife. every symptom could net get test. “anyone wants test get test.” another lie lengthy list lies govt covid situation here. Oof, wife waiting financial reasons I'm thinking twice kids 30s. understand metric can't 'once everyone wants vaccine opportunity get second dose'. People want link case numbers... far easier less divisive link vaccination opportunity.

According recent estimates we're gonna getting point 2 months empty appointments everyone eligible. someone lower risk mean risk. empathetic thing give opportunity choose vaccinated? 

Once they've given opportunity, masks required anywhere (outside obvious medical etc settings). least US, date far out. Lift restrictions based numbers (and begin lift IMO), lift mask mandates vaccination opportunities. I'm interested see economic forces decide profitable route take. 

I state dryly without judgement: liberals majority wealthy conservatives majority poor 15 years now. can't simply add number people favor policy guess economic impact, one side lot money spend people could decide prefer feeling safety comes wearing mask

There’s literally data support all. haven’t single piece evidence anecdotally online, real life, statistics supporting I'm going tag folks I've disagreements *months* now, since December, believe bungled messaging post-vaccine transmission fueling vaccine hesitancy. Grimacing faceHow many examples heard now? hear every single day.

-Quite people like Zeynep talking (vaccine hesitancy due bungled messaging).

She referring tweet among relative called today asking #covid vaccine. said friends/family choosing get vaccinated young + healthy public health officials saying still pass virus even vaccinated. messaging bad, really bad. experts say Italy braced new peak infections two weeks, warning daily cases could reach high 40,000 unless severe restrictions citizens' movement activities swiftly put government particularly concerned spread new variants coronavirus. include England, Brazil South Africa. home states sooner younger ages. Phoenix Ducey wants get shots spend money spring training actually doesn't. studies shown vaccinated people spread virus significant degree. think rise cases winter? simply tolerance people listen fearmongering ‘news’ broadcasts

I think different perspectives. lot people vaccine hesitant it’s watch OAN. Isn’t OANN? Anyways. people may reading. 

IMO it’s better convince people telling truth. “Problems hokum” truth. antibodies permanent? someone full year ago still show up? call around places? really realistic. demonstrated South African one supposed terrified involved South Africa lowest levels covid since May 2020 right now.

Immunity evasion isn’t thing covid. It’s locked one-receptor playbook. efficacy numbers transmission. test transmission. time. know easily 40+  vaccinated person without mask way, way smaller risk unvaccinated person mask.

The vaccines amazing helping us beat Covid denying reality. offence would sane person - works healthcare less - think that? 

It's borderline absurd. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I've vaccinated vaccine 95% effective likely 100% effective preventing serious illness death. parents vaccinated vaccine 95% effective likely 100% effective preventing serious illness death. yea, probably should't see might die.""

Great rationale.

Christ people unable think more, let alone slightest ability basic risk analysis. 

""Let wait government tell do, actually think myself!"" helpful suggestion ---- adds complexity.

If 2 choices are:

A --- (1) let Feds distribute 50 states, (2) states distribute individual counties (254 Texas' case).

B --- Feds distribute 3142 counties United States.

I'm taking choice A. Less entities coordinate better. Key info, obese adults, BMIs 30 34, 7% increased likelihood hospitalization 8% higher risk death due coronavirus, compared healthy severely obese adults, BMIs 45, 33% increased likelihood hospitalization 61% higher risk death virus, compared healthy weight.

For 5'10"" person, BMI 30 210lb. BMI 45 314lb. little obese little unhealthy. severely obese *severely unhealthy.* Man that's rough, know surrounding borders Brazil well wondering it'd dealt - massive country too. beginning doctors censored telling people disease resembled altitude sickness patients suffering low oxygen blood levels believed treating wrong using ventilators - it’s sad think lot complications could possibly avoided patients, claims hypoxemia would taken seriously start didn’t issue censorship Give months it'll required part back office planning.  Unless one kooky variants gets crazy w us! completely agree, think metric 30 bmi poor one. Can't stop, stop. #teammoderna Basically every biomedical scientist knows vaccines shown prevent transmission.

1) Fewer cases means smaller chance transmitting.

2) Controlled infections within body means smaller viral load infected person. translate fewer infections.

Basically vaccines work like this. stopped disease intensity, transmission, we'd many, many diseases constantly circulating around population. would lead mutations, variants, etc... We're *not* super high risk walking measles vectors time though. We're *are* telling men get HPV vaccines prevent spreading women.

The clinical trials measure transmission, sure thing significant effect. Claiming vaccines effective preventing disease large effect transmission would like claiming bariatric surgery causes people eat way less, yet know translates weight loss. kids adults lol. Yes, that's I'm saying. add deliveries pending confirmation adds 490M Q2. Look slide linked. knowledge, know two people tested positive covid, one died. 

But know bunch people putting high risk I'd shocked it. Even then, it’s guess. comment kind logically inconsistent, cannot say side effects “unpredictable”, immediately follow definitive statement aren’t worse side effects... make statement predictable. 

We’re confident mRNA vaccines safe long term can’t sure. Really can’t sure COVID either, since studies long term effects poor quality right now. also don’t understand statement. people think vaccines do? wouldn’t things get back normal, eventually? suggesting variants respect national borders?

Here's little hint you: That's president got treated with. 300m Q2 100m per month April onward... count third ""lockdown work"" talking point. Keep shifting goalposts cherrypicking data points though. 1918 Pfizer agree, thinking vaccinated people still spread virus vaccine 100% effective. endgame vaccinate enough people drive community spread. anything, you’re example overall data tells us: genetic component immune response disease, you’ve said would seem possible reacted similarly it.

The governor basically given green light go maskless. agile going go mask required store raise shit cold water lag time ~2 days, reporting Saturday's data, total vaccinations weekends tended lower weekdays. Expect Tuesday's data show similarly provided updates J+J.   export ban place. company wanted set new facility start exporting, can.

Until company that, there's nothing export.  said true, think missing important information provide. negative antibody test terribly accurate determine whether NEVER infected before, whereas positive antibody test fairly accurate predicting have. person mild reaction first dose, fever second, much predictive naive immunological state first dose. Much negative antibody test.

Paper  Woot! makes sense. doesn’t make sense people say UK doesn’t de facto export ban place, considering single vaccine private company left country. lots moments make worth it. Like son learning read sheer excitement realized could read everything around cute. older daughter loves anything space related like she’s always asking take telescope out.

People don’t understand high risk people still careful. It’s misery. sure we're going either (a) supply (b) personnel vaccinate many people per day? others didn’t? Seems like simple one sentencer add contract. think acting wisely. IMO, know vaccinated people spread it. also know can't spread well unvaccinated people. know exactly well spread it, clues. looking likely significant reduces spread, situation would definitely easing risk tolerance cases actually significantly (not ""it's longer absolute train wreck therefore let's open burn masks"" down, actually significantly down). Yeah, problem would needed even prevent 500k+ deaths we've had.

Other intermittent fasting, cut lot extra calories. mostly drink water, black coffee, plain tea. I'll occasional diet soda alcoholic drinks weekends, nothing like used do. also started roughly counting calories. weigh food anything calculate, record calories, kept rough count head based serving sizes packaging whatnot. cut back carbs bit too.

It’s worth ever infected virus causing potentially permanent health damage months misery significant fraction people were. Dont people care fuck ton it? see ads running time get people stop smoking. Also last 20 years so,in door smoking banned 2nd hand smoke affect people. let em in, vaccines give everyone immunity virus /s Asymptomatic transmission actually much lower initially suspected.

Just like flu. Unless coughing, sweating, sneezing, etc, breathing spreading significant level. positive though, cant harm anyone bad breath know breath bad. I’ve got auto immune condition. don’t qualify California yet either. get you. kinda stuck right nobody empathy. saying along, based new guidance inferring someone fully vaccinated, chance contract spread high enough bother testing quarantining. either saying along asymptomatic spread really thing, saying fully vaccinated changes way virus spreads would put money latter. 55+ mostly vaccinated ones fill hospitals. anyone link sources showing long term effects get vaccine part group fully immune? know symptoms way milder, asymptomatic people last year still showing long term lung scarring. know effects like long term detrimental effects still present vaccinated show mild effects infected? really, requirement form, current care doctor. That's policy obviously favors rich shafts poor, yet saying worth weed cheaters? CDC estimated case detection 1 10 earlier on, 1 7 recently, author article head full Jujubes.

Youve moved goalposts ""Israel crushed it"" ""well yes, tens thousands long-haul symptoms, thats sacrifice Im willing make"" 

Wonderful. OP saying CDC says vaccinated people can't transmit virus. growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely spread virus others. prevention measures continue necessary, benefits reducing social isolation “may outweigh residual risk fully vaccinated people becoming ill covid-19” transmitting virus others, guidance says.

Sorry upsets you, stress give fuck. knowledge district two days vaccinate everyone rest week recover, guess really cautious don’t think I’m saying things well. said can’t let efforts actually get large majority(85/90%) vaccinated. say don’t many people, say 330 million numbers that’s 150 days. That’s almost half year. Lock first happened 380 days ago so, 150 days significant chunk we’ve already through. Yes first 2 weeks biggest improvement get shot, it’s 2 weeks second dose you’re “vaccinated”. ambiguous? I’m really trying provide information read tell people 2 weeks first dose good enough. Nah it’s obvious. would’ve expected article say “there vaccinated people estimated total number cases COVID United States” based read headline. 

If expected talking “confirmed cases” used [confirmed cases] headline rather using “[people disease] since pandemic began”. says avoid domestic international travel point time. that’s risk you’d potentially taking unvaccinated individuals. got mine last week, arm SORE two days.

The federal advice ""not yet"" -- worthless. states going throw towel unless clear, reasonable timetable there. reasonable important, social epidemiological constraints play. weeks couple months left expect compliance, regardless case vaccination rates.  honest turned mistake.

I told 64 63 year old parents lie profession go get vaccinated Georgia throwing vaccines completely irrational basis. things re-open fully restrictions reimposed, barring emergence true “escape variant” makes current vaccines useless.

Someone jail priority someone prison. 

Here personal issue prisons lesser extent jails, warden basically god like powers run facility. state employees actually usurp federal agency protocols order Federal agents around facility. ability control comes facility. could establish protocols testing guards could lock keep prisoners safe. least here, biggest risk inmates guards. large party prison guards became super spreader event least 2 former classmates contracted COVID-19 visiting clients. 

Personally, would prisons go lockdown strict daily testing guards (which feasible vaccine out) anyone else entering facility. would rely health experts design stringent intake priotocol new inmates.. there, guards, employees companies contracted enter prisons, attorneys record criminal matters would early list vaccines. Anyone goes facility could bring illness basically. 

I believe approach would prevented hard feelings seen simultaneously showing trying keep prisoners safe possible without giving idea prioritized. perfect plan, plans limit backlash others. anyone else US getting impatient waiting vaccine?

Ending mask restrictions doesn’t make sense. know number people vaccinated growing linearly. true B117 growing exponentionally, good bad next months depends on

1. many people actually covid (actual cases, diagnosed ones)?
2. much protection B117 variant conferred either vaccination prior infection?

Official advice also says never go outside sun without sunscreen - ever. Lmao rightttttt. I'm mentally preparing symptom know happen. US, everything someone else's fault. favorite thing do!

“get ready roaring 20s” something people previously unaffected shit say. Fully vaccinated sports teams? Maybe go back 5th grade? Depends state total population received 2 doses. 

Check NYT vaccine tracking website. It’s pretty amazing. see CA show table. +1,809. Much better yesterday. There's thing. psychosomatic. soon news cycle finishes covid ""long haulers"" stop getting attention desperately crave. read article see specifically references December 2020 vs. December 2019.

People want lift restrictions drown debt job.... It’s Times India article Indian vaccinations. I’m astounded anyone thinks discussion global vaccinations (global world) doesn’t appear either headline article. personally think advice been, vaccinated follow legal restrictions, otherwise return normal, wash hands, everything normally regardless. 

Also took months release guidelines.

Vermont here, second that! that's last 3 months felt like, w/o vaccine I’m saying things, wouldn’t type read linked. trying help you. I’ll paste below.


The CDC discourages antibody testing assessing immunity getting vaccine. clinical trials, Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines shown protect people virus 95 percent time 94 percent time, respectively. mean everyone gets vaccine would test positive antibodies, Murphy said.

Commercial antibody tests may searching antibodies vaccine triggers. Someone vaccine immune virus may still test negative certain antibodies, Murphy explained.

Mutated virus may reinfect people already stricken covid-19, sparking debate concerns

In case, Murphy added, antibodies part person’s immune system response. studies shown protective cells, white blood cell helps protect disease, elevated patients covid, even though patients detectable antibodies.

“After vaccines, lot people going get antibody testing — ‘Oh, want see it’s working.’ actually little correlation,” said. “Many people test negative antibody test, mean vaccine didn’t work.”

Then get antibody test?

Health experts say antibody testing useful assessing prevalence disease community inform public health officials.

For individuals, Murphy said tests “can tell past exposure virus.”
“But doesn’t change anything else. doesn’t change fact get infected regular virus, may offer enough protection variants there,” said.

So, comes vaccine, said, testing useless. “Even you’re positive [for covid antibodies], would still get vaccine. you’re negative, would get vaccine. vaccine, really doesn’t matter whether antibody test positive negative. doesn’t help all.” start November day Thanksgiving number cases (7 day average) doubled. 2.2x growth. peak, 7 day average went 1.4x growth. I'm sure numbers looking at, even close. Go look graph tell think looks steepest.

Ok, here’s thing: want risk can’t wait while? LongCOVID thing. know two people complication, significantly disabled, months. youngish high-risk. perfectly healthy COVID.

You may grow person way - disability people - I’m sure you’ll enjoy much. realize varients seen back June India reported 1,500 variants. virus going virus. past year showed little control really have. many us teachers kids. know truth! 😄 **Costal Areas**

April 1st: restrictions lifted, still big indoor concerts anything sort, still mask mandates.

May 1st: 50% Capacity indoor concerts such, maybe proof vaccination required, still masks

June 1st: restrictions including masks lifted, maybe masks certain circumstances certain cities.

**Mid country, Florida, states like it**

April 1st: restrictions lifted, many mask mandates lifted all, still limits concerts clubs such.

May 1st: Pretty much restrictions, maybe mask mandates certain things.

June 1st: Local restrictions banned, 100% back normal.

Exceptions:

I think surge mild, evidence UK strain spreading despite OG decline. Spring increasing vaccinations likely mitigate becomes much problem.

However wrong variant becomes problematic could set timetable back weeks months. Worse said variant highly vaccine resistant, think unlikely, remains possibility.

I also expect mask compliance drop, saw summer think even thing vaccinated people low case numbers. It’s wild you’re one talking lol. Oxygen training masks thing years blow mind much endurance stamina gain training month. realize varients seen back June India reported 1,500 variants. virus going virus. past year showed little control really have. 3%? 90 days it’d 5x difference. ex likely helped... That's true, awesome data. I'm annoyed particular journalist title article -- knowing 3% hospitalized patients fully vaccinated prove effectiveness. simply knowing additional information two population sizes (how many people considered fully vaccinated, vs. not), would help put 3% perspective, that's mentioned anywhere.

If tell 60% people die car crashes wearing seatbelts -- allow draw conclusion safety seatbelt wearing? Maybe journalist could print article say ""proves ineffectiveness."" NO, need know many people road wearing seatbelts vs. wearing seatbelts. 90% wear seatbelts, 10% don't. fact 10% drivers non-seatbelted yet make 40% deaths makes much impressive seatbelts helpful safety. bunch islands effectively keep cases, not?

Exactly. Hawaii state best-suited pandemic. **Isolated**. do, doubt like huge one-two punch one like thanksgiving, christmas, new year's. Maybe we'll small wave spring break, last huge surge burned many hosts. Combine people vaccinated, tough see big surge happening again. ITT: people never heard oxygen training masks. forgot bring first card second shot, filled another card wrote second row instead. keep paperclipped together case ever need prove vaccinated. Define ""a few."" closer order magnitude weeks months. Enjoy infertility, blindness, deafness, chronic issues, death. I’ll take chances decent immune system. Well weird cause coworkers able schedule appointment online getting we’re adding appointments page coastal states. I'm Chicago things coming back around however, partially reopened restaurants come lot rules (e.g. sit people came only, milling bar, etc). get wrong, think much soon yet lot places (I still eating indoors, waiting vaccine, museums etc. people masked indoors), tell significant restrictions impact people's lives, music venues, sports venues, clubs, theaters still closed nothing currently permitted far public events yet, still permitted countries went summers Covid scheduled go last summer (I occasionally travel internationally work). Impending?

It's here. That's town too. Oh, soon I’m fully vaccinated, I’m definitely going partying up. idiots. I’d rather better company. reach herd immunity effective treatments prevent COVID deaths long COVID. health care workers aren’t overstrained taking care consequences “living life”, whatever want.

Well US really go lockdown 6 months ago it? Seriously, cut punctuation too. Nobody needs shit. dropping ain't slowing all. April 15th ugh still this? getting late let's go bed people act like it’s gonna way literal end time? We’re close, people trying throw away. 

You're calling persecution complex, could easily accuse victim complex. People Texas gonna ""throw away"" mask mandate lifted. there's one thing hope people sub eventually realize, would take almost impossible surge cases cause ""4th wave"" overcome vaccinations we're currently administering.

Then go book appt one   Haha look whos showing finger muscles behind screen Get ones rigid build suck mouth. Go eat restaurant, open every state. Eat outside feel need. 25, non zero risk get still pretty damn low. Alright dude. hope right wrong people? fucking job. essential. deserve better treatment everyone else? Cus ppl dumb. Alcohol. natural. Also IARC Group carcinigen. “we’re adding appointments” message means haven’t opened site registration yet... that’s around 6am (or last Thursday, anyway) sure downvotes. really true, masks help slow things down, vaccine really way truly like said. issue delivered. April May USA enough doses still Europe remains. political move.

In Texas two part. One distract bad Texas handled winter storm grid completely fucked. Also blame incoming surge cases immigrants blame Biden. kind stupid get fucking cruise ship right now. schools open UK right now? Dude idk rn think arguing argue, I’m place rn. bad. nice Sunday Uhhh... no?

 Next. First dose (Moderna) here...3 days feel icky, achy, tired hell chills on. 

Worth every minute it. lot times rare complications infections reason, happen random way virus progress interact host 

Have seen shit Strep Throat people rare cases? Among Hungarians.....

Assuming vaccine passport coming, there's worry able travel Sinopharm vaccine approved EMA. bout wear mask eat home ffs think day election saying 70-30 chance Hillary win, probably accurate odds heading election day. Yes, Hillary advantage going - think even write day Nate Silver said one margin error polling error away losing. while, I'm going watch movies home. someone went frequently movies, desire go watch movie right now. definitely want go back someday, right now. stupid way portray data. would also need know percentage population vaccinated.

If, say, 1% population vaccinated, proportionally 3x vaccinated people serious cases non-vaccinated.

On hand, 30% population vaccinated, 1/10th rate serious cases.

If 3% population difference. Mask up? Safe? Maybe, breathing wet cloth torture me. I'd rather go gym, work home. Doctors office? made lot unsubstantiated claims there. Pensions pay men women workers pensions.  weird claim largest democrat funding source. 

Further part bill also helps single employer pension plans. 

Lastly, % bill amortized several years.

If going cherry pick grasp straws ain't place.  might fare better wherever getting false claims, they're likely agree blindly. Guys... literally exact thing high altitude training athletes.

They've selling masks specifically restrict airflow years, sole purpose robbing body oxygen. called hypoxic training. yes, likely pass try pushing hard before. Take step back, slow down, work it. promise, experience gains endurance long term exercising mask.

Guess what? body starts producing red blood cells make shortage. nice know get affected others don’t, that’s scary thing. Everyone knows treat paper cut prevent infection. Nobody knows kids get mis c others don’t. It’s unknowns make scary. Delivery. chills fever general sense mild malaise Covid. extent it, except losing taste smell day later on. Very, plausible it. Around 40% hospital workers severe enough side effects need day work, started scheduling Fridays. 

About 14 hours injection got chills, hours later mild fever bad headache. managed last fever broke (at 24 hour mark) taking couple Paracetamol. Saturday spent day bed sleeping much could, work 3am Sunday absolutely ravenous demolished pizza. next morning took 1 Paracetamol essentially recovered. 

For best immune response want avoid NSAIDs unless really need them. know got mine 5 weeks ago, knew good immune response best building immunity. makes sense though. Low 90s usually hospitals would want keep monitoring pre-pandemic. France would rather fellow Europeans die order vaccines China/Russia? Herd immunity variable math problem based spread rate virus. Show estimated spread rate I'll show half dozen more. try come spread rate takes mitigation account different places time. practically prophecy manage nail spread rate advance. number guess. get solid herd immunity threshold pandemic still generalizing. Quit fixating magic number. true all. work KN95 every day. know properly fit one feels like. affect respiration rate googled it, sub 93% saturation, 30 breaths per minute per gov guidelines. Yeah know light criteria calling something severe COVID case... Yeah seem fine that, part vaccine diplomacy. Like say want gets family back home vaccinated alright. 

Still though seems like alright keeping borders closed tourists planning keep moderate lockdown model. I.e. Facemask, constant contact tracing 14 days mandatory hospital quarantine. Let teacher’s union work w state vaccinate many teachers want shot, reopen schools (w options remote learning desired). It’s pointless arbitrarily set date expect everything magically work then. ongoing problem things need sorted fly. get dates help people conceptually (ok *this date*) meaningless midst fluid situation. tourist spot piss grave dies soon Yikes!! Mine expires May, got around renewing month ago. Lucky grace period. problems aerobic exercise mask on. I’m asthmatic. that’s two cents. buy groceries wife first 7 weeks second 10. friends received first trimester well fine. 

It got little rough mixing morning sickness fever 2nd shot, maybe 8 hours feeling well rapid recovery. Yes. 

Which people get vaccinated. Children people.

Why even arguing? Thereby contradicting term 'mandate'. work fine, could run marathon one wanted.  

You don’t see LeBron wearing mask everyone working NBA tested constantly. yet demand full clinical trials ""natural"" thus magically safe? kinds people need put permanent quarantine. watch one video’s people replace iPhone antenna since injection would also need plus battery. Tenet canary coal mine studios depend what’s really driving trend. health healthcare system, concerns virus dangerous pregnant women worry access hospital care yes think couples might decide child crisis passed. couples aren’t looking add uncertainty lives crazy times might willing child things calm down.

But mostly economic concerns I’m sure we’ll see birth rate recover much. comment noted 2008 recession birth rates fell never rebounded like many people expected. Instead kept falling pandemic accelerating trend. It’s hard average American make enough money able support child young enough especially true states like California absurdly high housing costs. killed multiple people single-handedly. profession literally job educated covid exposure/transmission/risk elderly etc. ignorance excuse. adapt getting vaccinated taking boosters needed. adapt turning society ad infintium accommodate conspiracy theorists anti-vaxxers.

Therefore, doctors policy makers going find ways deal groups obtain immunity hard way. rest us getting shots moving this. Uh, Nate Silver actually smart knows he's talking about. see mask mandates lasting longer may, maaaybe June. adults vaccinated then. could even sooner cases go near zero faster mutations killing people? No. greatly diminishing efficacy vaccines? No

Yes they’re caused slight decrease nothing alarmed about. keep saying “but variants!!” want doesn’t change fact cases, hospitalizations, fatalities continue decline.

You realize people get vaccinated less likely chance great mutation cause super surge happen right? maybe there's none left. knew? No. whatever parents avoid avoid myself. nursing homes. pandemic experience proven broken many societal institutions are.  great news: light end tunnel. OSHA crack workplaces anti-vax supervisors? Thanks person actually respond rather downvote move on, think confounding two things. 2nd 3rd paragraph referring person responded saying majority adults least start vaccination end month, end April.  followers blind... can't argue they'll find excuse anything genocidal says think line sand better public health advisor literally living. way tell pilot speed fly automotive engineer thick frame F-150 be. know hell lot people choose go out. Make choice - don’t go out. I’m huge Osterholm critic think he’s unnecessarily alarmist points, genuinely surprised last podcast said messaging around vaccination needs positive. I’m guessing messaging change within next month so. Sounds like haven’t participating whole time. W Upvoted first post, got sad reading second post. research moderna’s eary mRNA cancer treatment trials mice. Completely destroyed livers. never approved, yet are. fully vaccinated see friends family? 1. People chosen get vaccinated drive autumn/winter wave end year.

2. People done necessary protect give life conspiracy theorists anti-vaxxers

3. Public health officials find way accommodate surge unvaccinated without lockdowns mask mandates (which conspiracy theorists anti-vaxxers **STILL** ignore, BTW.)  Let’s forget started reason spread internationally Chinese government’s stupidity, manipulation data, covering information world could’ve used. 

The west screwed handling it, don’t get wrong. let’s forget started, along many viruses diseases come from? They're literally speaking truth. Places shut hard implemented strong public health measures able get almost zero cases. Enough contact trace every single covid case keep virus bay allowing life normal. USA done Lets hope. less 2500 cases MISC reported US course entire pandemic 

Worrying particular complication like worrying papercut giving gangrene absurdly rare Yup. politics. narcissism. stupidity I’m brown dude that’s fortunate enough receive vaccine help provide others. Honestly white people using culture excuse get life saving vaccine racist half shit heard growing lmao. Trust me, poor people India say namaste would love privilege turn away vaccine. Ffs watch got head expert maturity think people want get paid nothing You’re gonna get downvoted hell, 3 particular public health messaging 12 months. really hate denialism Osterholm accurate job summarizing results people field? prob buy ticket airline, sooo He's saying prefers at-home movie experience versus one involving wearing mask. Nothing wrong preference. response might appropriate refusing wear mask grocery store something state? eligible? Source? government decides create mo Rh thin air pay everyone simultaneously destroying economic production find way place ASAP. want stagflation? last part true perhaps investigated anti-terror agencies. already part common cold viruses? 


[reference 1 : 2 : That's huge one people consider

I surprised roughly half K-8 children already infected point we're past pandemic &amp; economic fallout...?

Birth rates saw dramatic decline Great Recession also &amp; never really rebounded significantly. actually hate seatbelt analogy. It’s like requiring cars road functioning breaks, anyone doesn’t follow rules puts everyone else risk. uh oh SPICEWORLD!! South Dakota, nearly 1/10th population either Wisconsin Minnesota, almost double deaths-per-capita? Mississippi similar pop density Minnesota, similarly twice deaths.

Why Dane County 550 deaths per million whereas Racine County 1800? Similar pop density. pickup Dane County brewery two weeks ago step away door could put beer cart zero-contact drop. Milwaukee brewery pickup past weekend bar seats removed they're running 25% capacity tabletops (and 2 tables people).

Here Milwaukee nothing near business-as-usual, even things loosening. Almost every venue still closed, several favorite restaurants still takeout-only. weekend patio beer 45 degree weather drove microbrewery every outside (distanced) table also full.

You can't write interventions always work 100% everywhere, notably Wisconsin open certainly affected Minnesota, South Dakota affected us, southern counties Wisconsin affected Illinois.

I think people realize bad get, also bigger-city Wisconsin (where fighting pop density wars) still pretty locked down. guarantee anything want. Life already going without you. shows birth control hands women way effectively sensibly used. may pretty please vaccine thx gov You’re gonna able sustain high intensity workouts one those. There’s reason don’t see LeBron wearing mask empathize single extroverted person, difficult us, hear right now? You’re literally complaining, suffered COVID yourself, seeming taken many personal sacrifices huge portion country (and people around world) prevent spread virus. went bars holiday gatherings. summer surge US recent deadly winter surge US people taking actions like those. 

And complaining “goalposts” “shifting”, behavior people like - going “packed bars” “defiance lockdowns” resulting consequences case loads, lead pandemic stretching out. fellow young single person, sympathy initial post, feel silly now. patients organ transplants, essential workers keeping society going, one’s deserve sympathy, whiny counterproductive ass. justify act including bailouts multi employer pension plans underwater years, decades cases, prior pandemic?

How anyone explain anything giveaway Democrats biggest funding source? Never, still social distance, events can’t happen they’ll “super spreader events”, local small businesses still closed due economic impact COVID^tm restrictions. crazy part trace back one person. 

Rupert Murdoch. track cases common cold then? people get cold least year doesn’t matter hospitalizations deaths common cold rare. Covid case counts high people serious complications, still make sacrifices? problem businesses. dropping mandates, forcing small businesses “bad guys” requiring masks stores restaurants, anti-mask crowd goes resenting government (which little effect) resenting businesses, real repercussions. I’ve 7 months, teen daughter since October. trust science. Same. I've calling pharmacies getting name lists left doses luck yet. old hospital badge previous badge really tempted use jump line feels incredibly unethical. frustrating knowing there's solution whole situation politely sit hands turn :/ It’s technology Moderna, since Moderna BioNTech working mRNA treatments cancer allergies back 2016-2017

The issue given dose large enough effective, destroyed livers test mice. never approved.

This I’m getting mRNA vaccine. Yah werid comment? trump 30% chance Well, take biology tenth grade read fringe blogs, they’re experts now. looks half voting adults developed brain actually disagree Fauci internet. perfectly acceptable thing do. Everyone's boat, blows, forever. one boring year life. things back open - path there, probably longer want wait, - heck everyone's going wanting talk everyone. able expand social group again.

Also dating apps still people, people still meeting bars/restaurants dating. exciting before? course get creative things that's meal. gone. (Speaking someone who's dated past year, worked lol) locked down. Schools closed (until tomorrow). Restaurants pubs closed. Non-essential retail closed. Holiday lets closed. sil's kids seen kids age person since mid-December. You’re baffled accept dystopian America miss bigger picture. $3,200 fraction every comparably developed country provided citizens. Another $600 still isn’t nearly enough. Taking wide view humanitarian always valuable conversation choosing pedantic have.  I’m going call one suggest maybe get better sources?

Studies masks covid didn’t come CDC recommended mask use. Research respiratory virus masks people use didn’t come CDC recommended mask use. 

Whatever 30 second researching mask recommendations wasn’t reading scientific studies simply didn’t exist, almost every scientific board world recommended mask usage due belief transmission fomites common, making use masks likely actually increase transmission without proof helped. 

Only finding fomite transmission uncommon recommend mask use. science come support it. 

So researching? I’m German friend India. think foreign countries commonly known. childhood vaccine book 1980s Germany lists blood type. okay letting hundreds thousands die, like ""constant fear messaging"". trying be. inserting type color somebody's skin racist. say ""black ghetto mom stuff"" would say? Um, I've personally take mask lift heavy objects work. no, experienced Masks end-all-be covid precautions. work, *that* well. ""Mask = covid safe, mask = covid safe"" drastic oversimplification. personally agree amount change mood general public stays similar last 2ish weeks, June 1 pretty fucking normal. Maybe masks indoors, maybe lower capacities truly large gatherings, people yelling internet, that's it.

The mindset change last 2 weeks alone astounding. Selfishly hope go another 15 years I'd qualify battle appointments younger, even tech savvy people see would make sense. would insult coronaviruses Osterholm Pandemic Nate Silver 2016 election. Something like 60% Americans Phase I, point many states opened appointments “least prioritized” groups among Phase I. Mr. Miyagi says ""mask-on"", fuckers. depends, also good many people taking stance. couple friends go anyway times did, literally ones theater. Using North Dakota example, see surge cases positive test rate (which believe ended becoming high enough testing done). One thing note hospitalizations ICU admissions spiked North Dakota, well across many states country, around holiday season. [Another North Dakota source sure getting here. source linked North Dakota, example, clearly shows rise cases holiday season. majority people personally know got jabs (still can't get mine...) said second one killer terms side-effects. Almost none issues first one. Maybe keep schedule open April 1st 2nd, case... spending less option agree program (to vaccinate Americans abroad) considered Phase completed home. vaccines going Americans abroad at-risk population essential haven’t vaccinated US soil.

Another argument program would don’t want Americans residing overseas traveling US get vaccine potentially spreading virus. know many Americans Mexico exactly that, planning months. Maybe time. 7 day average still something like 1800 covid deaths per day. nowhere close 0. ""I love plan comes together"" - President Biden.

""I pooped again, I'm bigly stable genius"" - idiot reality tv star That's actually true anymore. need 80 90%. Likely 90%. Fauci CDC put revised report February new number. interview said knew high along reported lower number December maintain high confidence vaccination procedures. 

I'm fan Fauci main public relations face CDC pandemic. multiple times put numbers information one point, backtrack revise later say misleading public good.

I link press release previous comment made another recruiter couple weeks ago. mobile moment though hard dig up. easily find Google. good question, i'd also like see ages, perhaps frail extreme elderly... iirc SA 5% cases so, quote it. Well shit Hungary's cases rising scarily, hope situation changes course soon. Lol you’re victim. line wherever person draws. see reasonable others see unreasonable. You, humans, perceive way see correct way. 

For people Texas, don’t see soon. didn’t want mask mandates begin with. Many embassies well military bases received doses key staff. However, plans made public vaccinate every diplomat soldier, let alone Americans abroad. Basically low oxygen saturation levels, think Israel considers sub 95 severe COVID patients. There’s evidence of...blah blah blah happened reopen 1.0 33000 deaths. 

You don’t contain zero it’s still get California cases. need shut bit unfair equate ignorance fear stupidity.  


Some people needed fears calmed. That's irrational. Morality question, probably get downvoted.

I friend worked food service last March stopped due pandemic. county opened food service workers. badge cards prove it, even though he's working. family pressuring go try least. asked should, I'm sure cuz one hand seems many appointments many vaccines thrown away. But, hand, people high risk situations need first. Idk say. seems like idea thing spreads usually pass faster? Seems like we've stuck 'eye'  80% 60+ population past 2 shots February 1 here. safe say vast majority danger demographic considered ""fully vaccinated"". Jealous. parents MI, dad got late January he’s 65+ super risk he’s good. Mom stepdad next group I’m happy them. I’ll twiddling fingers IL couple months. think there’s disconnect. 

Half country see America failing covid things like lock mask mandates. 

The half sees country failing 500k dead people. 

These two sides never agree value different things. One side doesn’t trust government believes freedom costs. side loves government trusts willing give freedoms feel safe. Yeah, need find useful middle ground. Going caring previous administration super-paranoid pessimistic current one helping. Fun fact: Bird Box based lives. Could limit visibility driver. Passengers passenger seats face backwards, though.  know many people lied said worked healthcare essentially workers. half time even check.

Russian trolls turned stupid Americans anti-vaxxers, conspiracy nutjobs [wellness test others positive result antibodys. doc said part studie said yes. trying find something nothing find Google have, say, 5% fully vaccinated population responsible 3% hospitalizations, much less impressive effectiveness than, say, equal number fully vaccinated unvaccinated. 

This true. However Israel particular literally like 50% population vaccinated including like 80% 65 (i.e. likely hospitalized). case pretty hella impressive. Sounds logical San Diego reporting in. 1B tier 1. opened part 1B tier 2. micromanaging crap reason caused huge issues vaccine supply still bottleneck. soon case current distribution system become problem. Thank you. think girls women enjoying masks stops men self entitled jerks speaks society women. one people think another person smile purely pleasure despite inner emotions?  discrepancy always due places reporting shot number is. show number increased unexpected rate past days, maybe that's something. correct term ""whistleblower"" 41k new cases today another 1,000 hospital! Critics criticize. That's do. critics currently helping distribute vaccine? Yup, use extreme example show useless data without population numbers: 6 months ago, fully vaccinated people represented exactly 0% severe covid cases. thing Ohio.

In way, consider positive. infected provides amount immunity, everyone wants vaccinated vaccinated. third country infected, we'd theoretically need vaccinate little half country ""herd immunity."" Obviously overlap, we're also going stop vaccinating half country. big reason I'm worried willingness. people distrusting enough public health want vaccine considerably likely infected due apathy towards public health measures, meaning they're essentially already immunized, method could theoretically kill them.

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel.

Im insinuating checking box, trying understand people kids don’t want spend time think sucks spend time them. case things, presidents get much credit (or blame). But, can't cherry pick! Trump claiming everything good disavowing anything bad horribly annoying.

Truth: 
Trump's administration much speed vaccinations minimally required (approvals, etc). Something person could sure.

Biden's administration done much really speed things along either. JJ works long hit streets.

If want play ""Biden can't get credit Trump did"" game, I'd like talk 2016 economic gains. One again, much credit, much blame applies well. Trump cause that, economy already coming back 2008 recession nice clip. Trump rode wave. tell supporters that!

Likewise, Obama inherited shit economy go up. create jobs 2014-16? Nope, rode wave. That’s city LA, LA county (a better measure since tons little cities) around 10m No, 450 million 360 million adult. people already vaccinated deliveries 300 millions enough vaccines vaccinate 50% end June. enough, getting somewhere. yeah guess vaccinated fully expect people give crap CDC tells can't do.

what really UK set definitive end date even conservative end june. least that's something instead saying oh weeks BS   Exactly, one follow CDC recommendations not, obviously respect everyone’s property rights.

Anyone impose whatever restrictions want within property (or business) vaccine? CDC website says mRNA vaccines, adverse events common second jab. I’d *really* curious see leaflet...

Edit: here’s CDC page Pfizer shot: “ Side effects (such fever, chills, tiredness, headache) throughout body common second dose vaccine.”

Edit 2: Moderna: exact thing. common second shot. think point AZ vaccine like purchasing before. CDC guidance issued today, me, officially marks beginning end social distancing mask mandates. Get vaccinated and, even eyes organization whose job preach causation across board, get life start things want. Great news. 

Can’t wait get vaccinated. Looking forward day social distancing mask mandates lifted. 

Get vaccinated go celebrate friends family. ^ this. That’s meant “hug” grandparents Well least one Germanys top virologists Christian Drosten share opinion. short summary interview January (in German): huge pressure (completely) reopen oldies vaccinated might lead insane numbers new infections full hospitals (with young patients).  care meeting family members vaccinated am, I'm concerned vaccinated going back movie theaters, restaurants, places strangers. live near family need around people again.

Just tell vaccinated around unvaccinated people? It’s one favorite parts every show say along time. Hahahahaha That's different conversation, wherever happen live root cause overwhelmingly likely wage stagnation cost living increases. 

You're entirely right think working typical job typical wage enable live reasonable comfort security roof head, money bank, food table. Though ""recommendations"" impact private businesses allow, since ignoring exposed liability someone catches virus.

So good news! makes FAR financial sense baby $55k real impact income savings deductible child's health insurance bankrupt you. younger kids falling behind day-by-day academically socially. 

I don’t disagree open schools masks since teachers vaccinated, statement gives US school systems disturbing amount credit simply don’t deserve. isn’t Germany. isn’t Japan. school US could condensed couple years. 

I know, it’s big country privileged. US schools run snails pace and/or focus shallow irrelevant criteria. exact week last year world turned upside down. incredible see far come since then. really good news. we’re close! second dose cause mild sickness body aches next day, nothing serious worry about, happen often(only like 3 people know of). got second shot 4 days ago also sore arm.

US UK going pretty much done vaccinating population around June. lot supply freed countries point. pretty sure teach remotely effective capacity, unlike policing nursing... difficult understand? underpaid teacher's job save society, weird thought process there.

It might worth wait fall/winter even next year. USA conducting clinical trials kids right (older teens younger kids different clinical trials groups, put simply)

vaccine approved younger age groups vaccine companies submitted approved emergency use authorization authorization Can't wait start vaccinations nation wide visit again. cases Florida dropped rate. guess lockdown effective Germany's.

How moving goal post specifically tried claim schools shutdown due lack funding?

Are point you’re straight wrote way back beginning started losing really open. talking about?

Correct, reason thought claimed schools closed.  incorrect comment local school closed doesn’t mean whole country is. 

Never said schools closed. Pay attention! think read conservative forums online doesn’t mean teachers, journalists, economists wrong.”

Again, mean nothing dumb political satire? read think argument schools shut due lack funding, dingus

You tried claim schools shutdown due funding. wrong. apparently realize trying back still didn’t get hint. That’s ultimate dumbo

I get simply arguing point wrong even mean. significance dumb satire you’re argument reduced point? That's great! got Pfizer vaccine work far seems working, maybe, dunno. far gotten covid-19 yet. Whoever allocations Texas poor job.

It's really difficult find vaccine appointment Houston, even high risk person. Meanwhile, Houston-Area residents driving 4+ hours (round trip, plus another 4+ hours potential 2nd dose trip) Lumberton, TX can't find enough people vaccinate there. Hardin County opened vaccines adults, give allotment. brother able schedule appointment Lumberton first try.

Like, makes sense send Houston vaccinate high-risk people keep giving doses areas using all. also know high-risk people rural counties unable schedule dose.

Like, get initial allocations may off, would hope would adjust time. Yes. It’s based cold virus. body knows get rid those.  keep seeing JnJ's 72% compared Pfizer's Moderna's 95%. 95% refers efficacy preventing symptoms, 72% JnJ refers efficacy preventing moderate severe disease. actually figure efficacious JnJ preventing symtopms all, probably lower 72% even. comparisons made 72% 100%. great news.

However, since vaccine widely available yet\*, feel CDC hold larger numbers people vaccinated (ie 50+%). think due short supply currently, may cause problems vaccine distribution (some states already problems-I idea given option getting vaccine ""in future"").

\*I know US enough supply end May, shots need arms (which think happen fall). Americans *created* Reddit.

You welcome. US isn’t entire world Well presumably happened AZ cut back deliveries EU weeks beginning 22nd Feb 1st March, AZ track deliver Q1 target (well reduced 40m). little warning, Ireland example makes plans Thursday following week, ended around 20% short AZ delivery counted never came (or reduced amount came kind unclear left us 25k vaccines short week) easily argue getting back normal life much important human health something like automobiles.

You can't easily defend argument. We're months away herd immunity substantial reduction restrictions. cost months masking social distancing trivial compared risk people dying loosening restrictions soon. Thanks! great. family misunderstood news ""you may still able transmit; data"" ""Why get vaccine still get old people sick?"" Hopefully help see benefits turn. volunteering good bank means contact vulnerable population may likely health insurance live larger households high risk people. sake right thing getting vaccinated please don’t feel guilty. thank good person volunteering time help others. don’t think restaurant would constitute large crowd especially states still capacity restrictions It’s sub. Sort posts new you’ll see pretty quickly. Unless community rate drops zero, think fair say we'll stick masks etc. vaccine available everybody wants (I'm guessing end April there, close timeline).

What I'd hate see Karen antivaxxer able walk around without mask playing Johnny COVIDseed people able get shots yet. seems really unfair time.

'course, vaccine available everybody think fair done shit. decide listen asshole Facebook instead doctor, that's problem. Trudeau's mom owned one companies, I'm betting would bought way more. Australia got vaccines week AZ delivering EU scheduled. next week AZ severely reduced delivery EU, hence approving export license Australia.  CDC monitoring what's going Brazil? weeks guidelines rolling back lol wear mask avoid large crowds. I've mentioned before, wore procedure mask mass transit cold flu season **before** COVID reduced number respiratory illnesses caught factor five so. used get sick every couple months, year started wearing masks trains. think mandated anything, would definitely recommend practice people. people Texas opinion going die matter fuck it. Live confirm.

Those people also gave damns people even started surprise.  first weeks Biden's term also crazy weather disrupted supply lines.  reminds abstinence-only sex education, teachers deliberately withhold important information, exaggerate risks, lie brazenly ""noble"" cause preventing teenagers engaging ""sinful"" activity. used think public health professionals sort messaging. don’t think so, least now.

Look state ran LTC facilities. kid protects end life decisions may able make. course depends relationship next kin, whole leaving end life decisions state end badly. US going done mostly-done May, open lot supply rest world \[US's current vaccination rate would cover NZ single week\]. UK similar timeframe, mixed AZ / Pfizer. Meanwhile, Pfizer dramatically increasing production speed month.

I'm optimistic supplies available quickly fear. I'm referring many US Governors certain states, without vaccinations, acting like virus gone dropping Covid measures. Actually, put way, realize you’re right. Nerds probably don’t post pictures ignoring safety measures internet. I’m sorry attractive people lumping together social distancing ignorers happen attractive. seems strongly suggest that, they’re easing telling vaccinated people still shouldn’t visit nonvaccinated, high-risk people. (If knew 100%, wouldn’t necessary). text article even optimistic headline. can’t easily quote here, I’m bad Reddit mobile- 

“That means fully vaccinated grandparents may visit unvaccinated healthy adult children healthy grandchildren without masks physical distancing.”

Fantastic. Subjectively, yes. still deadly There's still outside chance could get sick pass on, unvaccinated family members makes sense continue taking basic precautions.

I figure around late April we'll hit point everybody wants vaccine able get it. that, ought shift situation protects kids 16 (they might get badly sick, also want lab vaccine-resistant variant) lets adults assume responsibility decisions. closer even spikes point. increases cases areas sure, enough people capable spreading virus also following protocols. ahhh makes sense, thank It’s less ideal, it’s binary situation. Taking mask 5 seconds drink water isn’t someone breathing heavily hour mask.  it’s less dangerous reported anyone clinical trial? injection arm hurting couple days could also happen placebo? got downvoted couple months ago local corornavirus sub saying vaccinated people hang without masks!! Victory, finally!! vulnerable people vaccinated everyone’s cool whatever risk it’s fine normal wedding Congrats! college student, can't wait return school well. I've barely learned anything past year incredibly lonely home. mention us exhibit ""classic"" symptoms fever, cough trouble breathing told coronavirus ""sore throat"". Even though sore throat I've ever made resting heart rate well 100bpm blood pressure 165/140. 

Don't know I'm included official numbers not, since doctor told running regular blood panels included antibody test whim. Yep 35 one child 5 constantly tired. think condescending nature comments unwarrented. everyone disagrees immature child, maybe stop talking like are? I’m shocked many vaccinated people still avoiding simple activities connections like this. Truly, wasn’t “common sense” implication would government potentially saying could never again...?  Talk nonsense. get vaccine. mom gets vaccine. People honestly thought equals visitations waving window??? I'm hoping governors start acknowledge this. Charlie Baker recently said mask mandate nothing whether vaccine effective. fact, opposite, get vaccinated could still carry virus. puts people vaccinated people remain part vulnerable population risk. think mask mandate- least get answers whether people vaccinated pass somebody else- end day still incredibly contagious virus people need take seriously.

His issue speculation vaccinated people still transmit virus CDC issued anything contrary. Well, CDC issued something contrary. I'm saying needs rescind mask mandate response advisory, think needs change messaging around relation vaccines. successful vaccination campaign mean return full normalcy. see case much know vaccines, think politicians need start speaking terms. less kids. exactly saying oxford-astrazeneca patented product discouraging vaccination? CDC never say it. fact - vaccinated people socialize scenario less risk driving around get there. we'll never hear said them. Check upthread. Lots good tools. Check CVS website every morning repeatedly 5am-7am. prepared pre-made CVS account insurance info everyone want register. 

I'm Ohio, peek PA giggles every day always find tons availability every day early.  would matter someone risk severe disease?

Because still don’t know 100% well vaccinations limit ability spread virus you’re exposed it. example, person (vaccinated) comes contact COVID via person B. Person get sick (because vaccine), could still pass person C visit indoors. would include risk, fully vaccinated people?

No, specifically say nonvaccinated, at-risk people. (Note: amount vaccination ever going 100% effective, fully vaccinated safe we’re going get right now.) yet happen anywhere. US way ahead New Zealand vaccinations. Agree. I've same-day amazon delivery occasion pandemic, stunning. I've met couple people said this. One guy I'm friends owns bar said ""even get vaccine return us back normal, I'm taking it.""

The majority friends take afraid though.  There's probably lot people realize want due thinking normalcy afterwards.

Telling people refuse take normalcy reason puts selfish light tell people ""I want take it, feels unsafe."" People like appear selfish, doubt many honest reasons. Need Florida, Ron DeSantis stop prioritizing rich GOP donor areas. idk need certain age? sure varies state.

I think plan trip late spring fine without wearing mask. I'd say summer know florida mid summer best time humidity theme park. I've done though, don't. says papers, single chart them. 2% 20%. 20% society hand washing became commonplace. lucky super lucky. People accepted risk back then. understand waited long say this, think message start. People getting vaccine much bigger problem long-term people getting vaccinated bit reckless.

I'd rather vaccinated people wearing masks distancing unvaccinated people loosely following protocols. yep. transparent honest covid back jan 2020 nov 2019 would never talking like vaccines. would never escaped china. That's I'm at. I'm fully vaccinated til mid April is, I'm curious word then, May, etc. time goes tweet even like curdled milk, guess could someone bewildered state re-opens weeks ""damn, thought cases still going tweet"", folks probably aren't. 

The CDC never big flying ""Mission Accomplished!"" banner fireworks celebrate ""end"" COVID. There'll updated guidelines caution, economic social end pandemic come go people even checking CDC's twitter feed year now. There’s much larger subset “I’m taking vaccine, go hell think I’m going continue see life disrupted post vaccine.”

Where could move get mid April, it’s younger people end line aren’t going need hospitalized die could see impact.  get mid April looking like nothing going change, young healthy person get vaccine? never going get seriously ill anyway. take unknown risks vaccine zero data 12 months, get tangible benefits? Humans aren’t widgets. Different populations aren’t going identical numbers. Also different variants present different areas trials. Ok? door dash stuff? Buffalo sign driving almost right away every death actively reported new grim mile stone, longer reporting. fear mongering. Reality grim CNN would want think is. public universities Florida starting announce in-person fall classes

Bonus: snow winters (for college seniors north looking get away snow) Chicago needs back terribly. Baseball drives lot summer tourism business bars restaurants need dollars back bad. IDK see posts regular virtual fall semesters. Thanks, CDC. definitely hadn’t anyone prior this. Depends ya go. I’ve heard DPH sites strict pharmacies. brought along paystub Kroger didn’t verify anything beyond asking category in. Well two sources administered vaccines 9.1 per 100. least one dose 6 percent. Parent probably meant first reality grim, fear mongering didn’t say destroy. That’s characterisation. said significant increase students failing impacts ability get university. real concern. Forget economics, lack help scary bit. can't even imagine would gotten first year without family able safely visit lend hand. Make sure cook egg rubber whole point article, one, zero death rates byproduct focusing death gravest illness rates order shorten trials. 

Not really knock vaccines reality check stats. Ships owned Carnival corporation emit 10 times sulphur dioxide European cars combined, insane statement.

You might want address part statement insane, tangent make look better. Nobody arguing ships cause want shopping malls, restaurants, etc, go local neighborhood support community, instead rotten corporations kill planet.

There's pretty big chance would still support rotten corporations 'kill planet'. 

Do smart phone frequently use electronics way? assume so, since posting internet. so, almost certainly also ""killing planet"", too. might want get high horse, almost certainly hypocrite. charts pretty good. Thanks! That’s essentially proving point. sub tosses links upon links shit evidence.  Seems like zero capacity nuance related belief people's capability nuance. staying far af anti vax morons, starters. Lol. I’m salty, saying people make decisions based available 100 years ago ridiculous. think reasonable expectation variants US? know vaccines eliminate hospitalizations hopefully increase see isn’t devastating. Serious replies, please. OP, jury still whether vaccinated person still carries/transmits virus? linked likelihood catching COVID? (ie, 94.5% chance they’re going carry &amp; transmit virus injected Pfizer). 

If prevents transmission 94.5% efficiency (or 62% whatever case J&amp;J) game changer, compared didn’t effect transmissibility Essential workers shouldn’t work without vaccinated

There many ways bring zombie apocalypse shutting grocery stores hospitals would good start 1B (or knows they’re still labeled phases) finally added educators today. see new list DPH website:  I'm gonna completely honest, there's one good thing that's come entire fiasco improvement relationship daughter.

It roses sunshine, comparing things lockdown night day. We've able work big challenges way could happened normal schedule. It’s undercount think that's awesome! days got sick, parents started showing symptoms. dad, almost never gets sick, went hospital chest pains, thinking heart attack. tests came back negative, except one biomarker heart damage, slightly elevated.

It elevated enough indicate heart attack, doctor suggested intense coughing may caused result. retrospect, seems clear Covid, know heart damage common symptom.

Everything matches well: timing (around Feb 1 2020), fact ""flu"" first time getting flu shots years, dad sicker I've ever seen before, heart issue. I'm 100% Covid, find far likely hypothesis. Colorado. They've gone doctor well local pharmacies nothing available June Like democrats proposed clean standalone bill, nothing else it, increase second $600 checks $2000 (the $1400 check got current bill).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m getting Wednesday. I’m fucking stoked Yep teachers get pass.. BS too. Idk correcting hard them. guess propaganda. cant keep putting pedestals call problems exist career field. guess easier make sad figure actually right them. right actually means calling BULL SHIT. think teachers paid think also ask paid more. “Feb 30”

I think may read something wrong. Take free award. Took long scrolling find answer. 100M includes J&amp;J? Thas matters terms many people gets vaccinated every month. idea sub weird fuck sometimes friend mine got day excess. Though asthma I'm sure anything it. know sure expecting get found place excess doses. stop insisting situation destroy entire generation. technically correct respect herd immunity, said sufficient immunity prevent serious outbreaks. We're short months away already happening

Ending masking social distancing done behest scientists experts, done politicians.

There's reason epidemiologists want see fewer 10k daily cases reducing restrictions. We're still susceptible outbreaks rising cases stage vaccination process. want cases possible, reduce disease death reduce possibility mutations could risk vaccine escape. evidence yet, I’d bet good money it’s deliberate. Could help Abbott GOP politically multiple ways point is, adding Texas list places COVID spreading like wildfire possibly mutating along way much move needle; there's already shit ton *very* populous places happening, happening, continue happen years come. That's say throw hands say ""whatever"" every little bit counts, end vaccine-resistant variant develops it'll probably regardless happens Texas US state next months, worth torpedoing mental health topic. Thank you! Curevac mRNA closer Pfizer Moderna That’s mean People want shit ""less pure"". COVID-19 created America's new great religious awakening sorts, shame flagellation name game.  not? Covid wild least way back november 2019 recall correctly Well claim make difference March I'm surprised EU sceptical. Also March set deliveries February (like 60:40 split) believe delivery promised March without making February doses around 30 million (looking lot like 31 million AZ said issues originally)  mention majority private schools New York City. certain point (likely within next 4-6 weeks) people going come terms

This precisely point people talking past one another. saying psychological shift another 6 weeks declare right time comes. side saying epidemiological shift 6 weeks dramatically lowering risk, physically correct. prove we've vaccinated? mean cards give get shot EASILY faked. Essential workers can't isolate. prioritized essential workers, elderly could isolate could continue essential worker elderly would get vaccine protected.   know. Strenuous exercise foreign concept me. Last week went 2 mile walk Apple watch reported stolen. :) Yep. signals CDC comfortable enough assuming lower transmission allow vaccinated people visit low-risk, comfortable enough assumption recommend visits high-risk people. question nursing home allow. Guidance like may allow person visitations. (I'm teacher, physician assistant) think it'd helpful list universities already saying they're going online fall heard already planning that. I've heard Iowa system they're planning mostly person fall. Calm dude. say government “lying” want sweet irony transparency releasing every single case info pubic helped us beat get back living normal maskless lives. Learn figure reply button lol. future reference, offered vaccine take I'm little confused. understanding vaccine full-blown preventive measure. guidance seems indicate differently. missing?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I'm excited guidance. sure miss friends. government’s policy doesn’t match CDC guidelines. Air travel still allowed many states actively encouraging visits. government (both state federal) truly wanted stop air travel, done so.  video September 2019...? That’s fine move. Baseball important Chicago CDC's current guidance, anything overly cautious, states fully vaccinated people unvaccinated people single household low risk severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks physical distancing

A six-year-old, assuming health conditions, epitome low risk. Hospitals need become overwhelmed anyways. Simply set strict patient limits triage less expected qalys saved treatment. real easy - tell get shot get eat. sure someone government creaming pants thinking that. say US minus vaccine part. understand far better randos Internet. Hey dont salty bc im never kids are. welcome constructive feedback concerns... 

I understand people, without underlying health conditions, probably big deal. risk probably really low.

But considering flareup daughter's AI take months clear up, spending hour every day meticulously administer treatment, I'm keen go back easily avoidable. Ah gotcha...in CA believe eligible whether person. Good luck hope get soon! *really* depends county/city. county sounds like they're going hold onto masks long humanly possible, areas (especially away major cities) probably loosen LOT earlier. least sticker says I'm vaccinated, people mistake Republican. 

That definitely sounds like something batshit insane Republican would do. would definitely assume anyone wearing 'sticker' like point nuts. Exactly, polar opposite anti maskers. small part anti maskers exist. two loudest groups ruin everything even though smallest. Mmm...I'm way, people trust first place. Something think about. given mandate procure vaccines.

And failed again.  novel thought. Christmas hopelessly pessimistic opinion.

We Belgians expect worst often still disappointed. Turkmenistan still wear mask social distance public, per CDC guidelines. “OK” meet small social gatherings. Case Western Reserve planning 100% normal fall. much worse 3 weeks AKA suck obey get screamed at. people downvoting 💀 (baseless uninformed) opinions

This _Reddit_, Lancet. also undercount, almost none essential minimum wage workers beginning pandemic got tested disease spreading like wildfire. Instead forced work get sick. immunity developed human sacrifice probably helped slow spread others some, like year symptoms fully gone away, may never. really wanna experience whole Star Wars part it, well sun nice weather long year strict quarantine. Thanks info! took weeks come this.... Disneyland here. left day shut park down. absolutely nothing coming back it. I’ll always remember waiting line Peter Pan within span 15 minutes heard Tom Hanks COVID, NBA shutting down, colleges shutting down. Absolutely insane panic. saying 8x December. hard time believing somehow cut half since then. It’s probably around 5-6x, 148,516,905 (44.73%) 178,220,286 (53.68%). largely non-overlapping vaccinated population well. overlap, majority not. least 55-65% minimum immune presently. Even unvaccinated folks need mask park.. original numbers posted ""do nothing 2 million die""

Now we're one year TON precautions 500k dead.

The imputed IFR .6%. Want know .6% American population is? 1.97 million.

Is argument really done nothing dealt another 1.47 million dead people?

At IFR support measures like quaratine, masking, social distancing? many people need risk care anyone yourself? may, given timing (February 2020), nature symptoms, fact dad gets flu shot every year, fact almost never gets sick, find Covid far plausible explanation. That’s I’m curious this. Oxford study found reduced hospitalization Nothing stopping people rest world upvoting stuff isn’t US-centric. aren’t majority Users, biggest block single interest users. two numbers together highly unlikely. Virus high R0 tend want host live walk around spread. killing 25% people reduces ability spread. differences, though. J&amp;J ran trials later variants. Pfizer Moderna regularly PCR test trial participants, numbers don’t account asymptomatic cases. Atm can’t find whether J&amp;J not, know AstraZenica, example, PCR test regularly, accounts portion efficacy difference. No, saying either things. Vaccinated people carry virus. Unvaccinated people could develop serious symptoms. Unvaccinated people still need watch get vaccine lower risk personal injury. 

Personally though, feel much risk yourself, family vaccinated, would go ahead see point. biggest issue protecting elderly at-risk. people still get mildly ill covid, especially outside common risk groups. vaccine messaging disaster since start. highly effective vaccines shown incredible level protection becoming infected COVID-19, trials real-world data. 

I'm sorry media public health officials done poor job communicating you. Vaccines perfect. None ever been. risk vaccinated infinitely small. Even ever-cautious CDC telling resume living life. good. :) get so:

The agency continuing recommend fully vaccinated people continue wear well-fitted masks, avoid large gatherings, physically distance others public.

Please rain hate, looking understand is. public take precautions prevent spreading virus? S/o NY! open. 

Correct even showed majority schools open stated need funding. 

I never said anything schools open closed. still think arguing schools closed. 

You claimed schools closed due lack funding. incorrect getting funding. 

Correct argue schools don’t need money want. 

I never tried argue that. Pay won’t change thing far things moving forward.

What made schools closed 

You claimed schools closed due lack funding. incorrect talking budgets schools getting funds. quote schools remain closed though. So, funding exactly they’re still closed prior funds haven’t spent.”

Correct, response claim schools closed due lack funding. pointed funding still available schools cares act can’t use due covid restrictions preventing opening up.

Pay funding goes schools. Schools open schools closed.

Some correct incorrect. portion funds specifically assist schools students returning in-person learning. Till happens funds cannot used. 

Hence finding still exist . Schools shutdown due covid restrictions can’t use funds. 

In way schools shutdown due lack funding I’m sorry wasted time

It’s apparent you’re concerned informed subject want push false narratives simply avoid wrong.

Not problem though posted FB asking else would fully vaccinated Easter could hang. One anti-mask, anti-vax friend like ""I'm getting vaccinated I'm friend!"" I'm like ""....."" would comment? hanging out. haven’t indoor dining, dined outdoors handful times since pandemic. guidance risk either vaccination? It’s something really miss. true you’ve gotten first dose though? got first dose two weeks ago past weekend started getting bunch symptoms. Lethargy, fever, chills listed potential side effects vaccine. isn’t listed potential side effect coughing shortness breath.

Who right mind use vaccine proven effective country?. Hey 😘 kids fine, kids won't. rhetoric - many, many studies impact children's education. year ago, every school closed. Last September, majority kids country school least part time, making stuck fully virtual schools huge disadvantage.  US significantly higher death toll per million Brazil. second wave look particularly line countries experienced. do, trust me. used give fuck FAA signed something anymore. problem wearing mask pandemic. problem people want prolong mask mandates longer they’re necessary. couple months rate we’re going. report, Shin Bet’s controversial surveillance program also unable pinpoint source infection possible new cases stemming family.

I'm sure Shin-bet find way make them...um ""cooperate"" Seriously. got back apps beginning Feb phase opened Kansas. definitely know I'm hoping meet second dose (weather delays affected early got dose one) they've also vaccinated. thought knew last summer? Understood. I’m synthesizing lot comments I’ve heard / read generation students never recover academically socially. I’m sure have. specifically talking NYC. primarily remote hybrid. good reason, city dirty hell public schools especially don’t resources keep schools cleaner absolutely bare minimum. I'm observing pattern state's covid subreddit 65+ individuals still need vaccines want logistical issues getting **to** pharmacies anything else. much pure lack appointments anymore. Maybe mobility issues can't drive all, maybe can't drive 2+ hours parts state appointments readily available, etc.

We opened eligibility 50+ preexisting conditions today right call considering that. think state/county health departments, least state, need make better efforts meet rest 65+ population are, quite literally. reason people problem forced wear burqas? annoying imposes personal freedom choice. Obviously necessity pandemic spread aerosols, something people want enforced long-term. understand people act like big deal, honestly. need. People put bios (I bet already do). I'm sure tons dudes capitalizing eligible bachelors without risk surprise pneumonia.

Apps want contend whatever backlash comes substantial anti-vax population. need know -- risk death low kids, yes, death whole story. throughout pandemic articles even mild asymptomatic Covid cases adults leading long term health effects. happen kids rate? research this? Somewhat Doubtful yes. Possible, also yes. literally evidence variant evades kind immunity all. vague implications one might, mainly news agencies worried people stopping tuning covid updates may paywall, here’s gist happened:

“Bahamonde said Saturday, individuals showed site vaccine said health workers, identification them. Instead turning away, site reaching daily dose allotment, staff vaccinated them.

Bahamonde said individuals spread word, may contributed others showing Saturday despite meeting state criteria. Numerous local officials reporters tweeted site administering doses Florida resident 18 older.” That’s awesome! found *not* vaccinated last summer, Pfizer wants give week keep study. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Exactly, I've little weirded hearing people say they'll still wear masks social distance spending time indoors small groups everyone group fully vaccinated. Obesity designated condition worthy early vaccination, along age chronic medical conditions. NZers enjoy cut world? that's vaccine skepticism gonna get them. don’t think there’s problem act wearing one, we’ve pandemic year constant reminder life normal. I’m guessing resistance masks due that. People want life normal again. Florida says hello 🖐🏾 literally mean I'm calculating confidence interval likelihood Covid. making point given evidence available me, seems like likely hypothesis. Professional teams? state, governor opened 1B fully enough people getting didn’t want vaccines go bad. It’s happening, are. Great though! got confused also. Ah, missed connection, yeah makes sense actually. EU indeed suggested, know it:). majority schools US open form since September (more 60%) Royals 10k (cap like 37k). Excited go back. lucky MLS team limited cap games took things seriously. begin year stipulations last year ended, thankfully. FUCK Call insurance keep giving names towns ever expanding radius find next-day appointment. Can't surge cases already high.

Sure they're month two ago that's leveling baseline baseline summer. Probably says things like ""definitely"" ""my confidence interval 99.95%""

Also he's extrapolating anecdotal assumptions (not even anecdotal experience) entire population.

So, people downvoting guy who's talking ass? Probably he's talking ass. truly understand problem wearing mask. It’s beyond understanding.  true. Even pre-pandemic today’s parents spending time childcare-related activities previous generations. today’s stay home moms rely libraries, play dates, children’s museums, grandparents, etc. things ripped away.

Bro already checked state guidelines vaccine eligibility? Starting today, caregiver child AI condition would eligible state. Smart people anybody Disney World Orlando recently? Planning post vaccination trip wondering considering Florida seems bit free moment lol make great points promising drug candidates survive clinical trials. Last year dozen drugs looked good initial studies proved disappointing randomized controlled trials came out. Nowhere advice saying go maskless public, safe private interactions vaccinated people unvaccinated low risk people (both within household). No, says okay vaccinated people visit indoors unvaccinated members *of single household low risk severe disease*. good info substantially limited saying.

So there's concern, risk reasonable long limited. source why? covaxin US? thing confidence interval anecdotal evidence (otherwise known n=1). Stop using terms understand sound smart, opposite affect present yourself.  [new CDC say unvaccinated people single household individuals risk severe COVID-19, visit fully vaccinated people indoors, without anyone wearing masks, low risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission. example, fully vaccinated grandparents visit indoors unvaccinated healthy daughter healthy children without wearing masks physical distancing, provided none unvaccinated family members risk severe COVID-19.   unvaccinated people household members increased risk severe COVID-19, attendees take precautions including wearing well-fitted mask, staying least 6 feet away others, visiting outdoors well-ventilated space.  example, fully vaccinated individual visits unvaccinated friend seventy years old therefore risk severe disease, visit take place outdoors, wearing well-fitted masks, maintaining physical distance (at least 6 feet).

This recommendation appears based combination vaccinated people less likely transmit virus unvaccinated people really big deal unvaccinated people low risk COVID (reduced) risk getting infected anyway, still cautious (reduced still there) possibility vaccinated person could spread virus *high risk* unvaccinated person would severely affected infection, unvaccinated people still spread virus before. jobs high infection rate despite health sector.


Case point: Caretakers children 1 6yo. highest infection rate, even healthcare workers.

Sauce: Barmer AOK, biggest insurance companies.


Funnily enough today *all* kids allowed return kindergarten. Every caretaker stood clapped (sarcastically). Kids filthy. 3rd wave coming. good ?  Texas got rid March. basically treat unvaccinated people like people herpes (except status change). means companies start developing eco friendly ways still this. mean people restricted enjoying way that's like do.

In free market, demands would picked innovation would happen. issue however free market.

We need innovate, restrict. backwards thinking.  Winter important us too. Literally gamer always think covid vaccination “checkmate” hope it'll soon, I'm going hold breath. said, give employer credit effort put patience they've issues stemming this.

For example wife massive migraine months ago went doctor made take test. came back allowed work since work company, sent home even three hours got there.

They paid wife stay home four days required test came back without using vacation time. Thankfully negative. things could worse, honest employer pretty damn good kind thing. stopped giving people problems ""performance"" attendance (barring clear abuse) know they're working getting us vaccine. I'd give effort.
Again perfect, I'm certainly willing give credit credit due. Hungary's decision get extra vaccines Russia China looking real good right now. (disclaimer: Hungarian) evenings ago, saw tip Facebook pharmacy 30 minutes away expiring Pfizer taking walk-ins. immediately jumped car time got there, cops outside turning away throngs people outside, sign said ""no appointment, shot!""

The Facebook tip may wrong begin with, definitely something dystopian whole thing. states sort Mexican standoff, waiting first one pull mandates restrictions. takes one make move rest follow soon after. 

I'll masking I'm vaccinated mandates gone, think someone hates them. They're effective cost literally nothing wear. Covid’s dude, vaccines in. Take doses, call day.  I’m pretty sure whole body positivity movement sponsored coke McDonald’s... California even tell us expect social distancing mask wearing end. depressing. seem thrive suffering. I'm worried ""not enough people want vaccine."" Right demand greatly exceeding supply, increase time. Even steadfast anti-vaxxer able resist getting see literally friends family so. Hahahahahahahahaha Blows mind people need medical “guidance” “allowed” fully vaccinated. mean unwinnable start. gonna kill world cold... Good thing I’ve enlarged lymph nodes years lol. yes, doctors tested everything mine years, nothing wrong, they’re big 100% fair them, almost whole year normal. missed last 3 months, best months doubt, class 2021 lost everything. 

I highly doubt they're going ""normal"" graduation. Normal could mean many different things; case, mean Class 2019's graduation. social distancing, masks, etc. Completely normal. Hell, probably even going person them, like us. might still Zoom. 

They forget prom course. Unless schools come lame socially distanced thing people put suits dresses sit around play musical chairs something totally worthless like that. know schools lol. 

Us Class 2021 going ""lost classes"" far I'm concerned. Class 2022, hand, decent shot normal one like Class 2019. I'm month second shot boss probably still require masks majority social interactions. Beyond I'll wear simple mind. Get ready US locked another year. Thanks Wyoming year old headlines. water wet. Media working hard scare people submission. always doom gloom. expect see lot states this, agree, it’s foolish think people gonna keep living way much longer. letting gas? Also, nothing magical happens 45 days.  biggest jump within first two weeks first shot. BMI 39 31 huge, good work! I've read conflicting info. I've read 14 days 28 days. Care share source information? Perhaps clear matter up.  Quick, spend DNA points upgrades 3% number means nothing without context, case context would summarized lifetime unvaccinated vs. vaccinated, normalized age. ...Did forget March 2020? single week entire world fell apart. governor state declared lockdown grocery stores immediately became packed Christmas big Packer's game combined. Entire isles empty hand sanitizer hand soap completely gone. /r/Coronavirus users actually believe lol almost wanna upvote comedy, sadly know actual whack jobs Twitter think like privileged able stay home 100% time holding vaccines allow others higher risk get I’ll glad get ours!!! Meanwhile rite way California throwing away doses. Yet one cares. literally vaccines work. Antigens get transported back lymph node immune system goes work.

And anyone responsible reading x-rays looking cancer lymph nodes know this. work first two years college finally save enough finally quit enjoy somewhat college experience jan 2020 got 1 half months college taken away best years life gone like graduate virtually month like point get work 40+ hours week lot responsibilities time enjoy life. missed milestones need enjoy post college years never went bar never relationships never heard important socal things people longer tolerate knowing post college what's point going pandemic took last good years last change make rest decent like continue. Many people - including risk serious illness - still unvaccinated, vaccines fully protect transmission (which know yet) opening allow virus become widespread mutated, cause massive problems future even illness go immediately. Patience. live without ""epic summer"" months. We're almost ready go back normal - maybe even summer best case scenario - want shoot foot yards away finish line really think can't read medical study? understand everything mean can't read understand good bit it. Plus usually conclusions studies usually easy read. 

I give two shits media tells do. care doctors experts say. decision get vaccine full knowledge side effects. side effects fun, getting knocked ass nearly week worry may exposed worse. case sector allowed innovate, people still travel environmentally friendly way.

It mean people restricted again. free market, demand would picked companies would start developing environmentally friendly ways traveling.

We however free market, way backwards thinking restrict people things. mean isn’t part saying it’s 4x higher people weren’t tested? say statement like “I don’t watch TV” means don’t watch television shows. OP case “well actually’d” fact watch TV shows, traditional television. child feels unwanted get 24/7 attention constant affirmation parent maladapted child. adults feel genuine delight satisfaction socializing child day, every day. kids feel equally satisfied interacting parent day. recently we've created insane expectations parents wholly happy satisfied time else they're bad parents. No, they're humans. wedding (which rescheduled twice now) july 10th. gonna insane Ohio already open 50+ next week. North Carolina includes people smoked least 100 cigarettes life.

I might go chain-smoke couple packs (cartons?) cigarettes road-trip North Carolina. :) Plus, time get I'll probably look like I'm 75. Serious question here. Assuming people aren’t forced get vaccinated always mix vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated public places like grocery stores indoor dining. mean wear masks indefinitely? Great. country fuck prevent spread gets vaccine. countries controlled disease get fucked vaccines. Makes sense. Pretty sure still spread get it. Moderna delivering fuck Q3-4, afaik. lied... always lie. won’t 100% person, parents sane enough keep child school building 2020-2021 school year teachers move online person students. would one thing going back mid school year *way* past that, time middle high school gets building that’ll left exams. Except empirically people low end obesity scale (BMI \~30) less likely covid issues:

Except empirically people low end obesity scale (BMI \~30) less likely covid obese adults, BMIs 30 34, 7% increased likelihood hospitalization 8% higher risk death due coronavirus, compared healthy weight.**  severely obese adults, BMIs 45, 33% increased likelihood hospitalization 61% higher risk death virus, compared healthy saying small percentage musclebound low-fat individuals technically ""OBESE"" reason baby bathwater. I'm saying, UK approach defining Obesity Covid priority 40BMI makes sense. Look 1930s Germany see far people take obedience state.  people bothered something doesn’t bother ya know  think vaccinated people scared getting virus. think unvaccinated people scared getting unvaccinated people use excuse go mask-less. there's enough vaccine go around, get vaccinated you. then, still try protect others around us? Omg hilarious! that’s Appx. 3m per day. doesn’t seem ambitious. play Magic person yet lmao? Hey OP, make account Walgreens try see available. parents saying same, normally fine tech don’t need help anything. finally make account moms name looked appointment booked 2 days trying. Maybe practice trying get Ps5 weeks paid lmao. Check midnight hour. updates hourly. people tend check maybe day others refreshing hourly lose 😭. Good luck!! stayed touch single person met college. suppose people social others. many long-haul covid symptoms arent fully understood yet? Well, thought so, comments everyone pointing number infected way higher confirmed infected. Depending many, would theory already (they gave ranges 3x-10x, 10x would 290m people, herd immunity already).

The reality really know we're at, numbers make wonder. I'm sure 25 people live Wyoming excited this. definitely unleash crazies comment.

I'm Canada bullshit happening here. Feds procured enough vaccine healthcare provincial jurisdictions; Conservative governing provinces, bone pick Liberal Federal Government, either using vaccines political football, coherent plan get jabs arms... both.

Luckily, I'm left-leaning province actually plan every confidence we'll time July. People joke every game I’ve recently somewhat full. It’s hard beat going ball game $7. Potentially. also enforcing public health guidelines easier apply everyone man crying buzzwords actually resorting buzzword doesn’t fit

Poetry true. tried get test Next Level Urgent Care Houston back March last year week textbook case. Flu strep test came back negative, said denied test probably allergies. never allergies life. prescribed Prednisone, take, along Promethazine take. 

Got approved test later week, drove north 45 minutes take it, went ER med center recommendation respiratory doctor (major brain fog day, thought oxygen saturation pretty low told him). ER CT scan saw pneumonia lungs look pretty par covid. Test came back 2 days later positive. 

The ER told throw away Prednisone likely make condition even worse. hope so! think we’re ready live overly politicized society. Everything broken ""us vs them"" mentality. people see CDC enemy sorts, reason cannot ""go back normal."" Make mistake, lot also harm folks provide bad potentially unsafe advice misinformation them. supposition 2mil vaccinated day incorrect

Sorry dude, thought ""like"" understanding vaccination rates wildly increasingly made clear approximate. remember ""You forgot Poland!"" meme? I'm reminded seem trying downplay situation emotional reaction ""I'm tired it"".

Huh? I'm fully vaccinated. I'm done dude. whatever want. I? get desire. drove site almost four hours away get first shot soonest could find appointment. Younger population compared western nations. Average age India 26 compared 38 US 45 Italy. roughly half India entire population 25. Younger population=lower mortality rate since deaths elderly. Also testing. Lower testing poorer countries inevitably missing quite deaths well. South Africa example excess deaths stands 145k compared roughly 50k official covid deaths. pretty much things already doing? Thanks CDC!

Edit: Oops, forgot I'm vaccinated yet. I'll continue pretending like I'm things like rest you. That's quite impressive indeed. Unfortunately, much rest world lacking behind waiting U.S. get fully vaccinated drops export limitations countries buy sufficient doses vaccine well. 1.7m last monday... meh get time Skinny people thinking countries mandatory 2 week quarantines. families looking return, help much kids still vaccinated. Basically free movement borders going gated vaccinating population. family this. brother, mom, wife shots. dad work together small business. We’ve already one family dinner. dad schedule first shot tomorrow. don’t know get together I’ll one I’m family lives city without shot. feel safe hanging everyone. mention metabolically normal human: steroid use, well fantastic genetics incredibly hard work, makes outlier ridiculous. Wow. escalated quickly. 

I pointed Arnold someone literally everyone visualize (except us Aphantasia). 

In 1974 Mr. Olympia, 6ft2in \~250lbs-257lbs depending source. Look up. Arnold admittedly extreme example, I'm sure us name half dozen athletic individuals fall category. ain't myth, reasonable, critique BMI measure  guys urgency aspect it, 625K per week definitely possible given need to. US something like 2 million per *day*, (Canada) we're close 100K per day right capacity many times deliveries doses ramp up. Overall, 90k shots per day impossible target. Oh fuck off. one planning us staying inside wearing masks forever. They're saying get seriously sick mean go around hugging strangers licking food, spreading disease people inoculated yet wait people protected virus less prevalent return normal. much think people minute? people disease

is survivors people died too? Well that’s way going look 

Then Canada great /s true games *flashy* 2007 (Pun intended). Plague Inc developed 2012 benefit created Unity industry lot time mature 5 years. agree. it’s possible (maybe) friend getting tested travel work something didn’t involve symptoms exposure didn’t think twice it. always solution everything power stop virus CDC pretty bad policy, good thing states ignoring them. Even New Zealand trust Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Projection then? Good expected. supposition 2mil vaccinated day incorrect seem trying downplay situation emotional reaction ""I'm tired it"". tired something change reality. especially exhibited wistful thinking it'll last ""what, another two months""? seem like much medical expert, seem think could still issue much longer. Which, not, great. I'm also ready over, I'm going make assumptions happens. vaccinated. Great. lot people still know ""herd immune"" population looks like yet. They're antiscience. Good point. Can't wait get shot! :) airplane surprisingly safe, well ventilated. great trip, sorry hear circumstances though. get next year tax credit? know people babies 2020 getting stimulus added onto years tax refund. sure thing year changing anything. can’t speak specifically, yes general manifests Facebook social media platforms. I’m sure Reddit plenty well.

It works sort similarly scam calls emails, usually bit passively. lots variations Im sure plenty ways go it, general method fake profile looks fairly real innocuous made. profile used create posts spread misinformation, division, dissent. posts may original posts, usually comments something else message seen broad audience disseminated exponentially. Memes whatnot containing misinformation dissent utilized often. Similar scam calls, posts broadcast many many many people (an argument could made arguing spreads even more), work sway even successful.

This quiz circulating November elections fairly informative interesting opinion: can't stand tbh. irritating uncomfortable. Many people obviously feel way. signs point yes.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* read total 2.9 million I'm getting shot tomorrow! Can't wait forget sub exists. Hope see music festival soon. First round me! Lol. saw aftermath television. definitely point there.  He’s probably... overweight. 

30 minutes gym time week going build type lean muscle mass would break BMI chart. yeah sure except significant far dangerous risks covid literally demonstrated many many times including long form people symptomatic going year now, know little things like that. downplaying covid comparing flu point outright asinine Speaking good Monday numbers, might 40k cases today, too. really know yet. studied speak. Right now, advice behave like still spread it, case. Here's hoping spread vaccinated people minimal. would make getting much easier. God, people already arguing new CDC guidelines saying still need wear mask they're sure efficacy vaccine kicks in. Wtf. phrase “the government pays” correct? hard draw conclusions numbers ways numerator denominator counted always equal.

Also, testing expands, people less severe symptoms get tested. could lower positivity rate people feel like getting tested becomes easier get tested go see somebody.

But yeah, held constant, signs say winter case surge need weeks hospitalization surge. said goal smart cus easy hit makes look really good. Vaccines arent equal though. wouldnt compare pfizer vaccine flu vaccine. 



Different technology, efficacy rates, method study, etc. last year tobacco killed even people COVID 19 -- dont care much? UK government fully funded setup production capacity condition filled UK order first. never met anybody real life said won’t take vaccine assumed wouldn’t help regain normalcy.

I met know dozens line work (an industry shuttered covid provided virtually aid). I’m saying made it, risk stupid easy. goal come liking Biden otherwise show support, I’m sure reflected looks much like opposite. 


He also raised expectation 100 million doses, fully vaccinated, believe also set loftier goal 150 million... ended able fully vaccinate adult Americans end May. would 130 days beginning administration. public voted thinking vaccinated people still spread virus 

This going one things people look back cringe next year. reason anyone entertains thought explicitly studied whether happen. Probably id imagine lots people kids 0 planning bad circumstances. suppose Corona goes show bad didnt see higher conception rate. got first Pfizer shot Friday today terrible migraine, probably unrelated get fairly often. assume okay take Excedrin today? tried tough heard acetaminophen reducing efficacy became unbearable. Whats going larger cuts. 4th wave real happen. get buried downvotes, denying problem make go away. variant ravaged Europe here. Start getting prepared mentally, back shit April. I'm even sure getting standby list even possible anymore. Maybe back January requirements really strict throwing away lots doses due no-shows. floodgates opened there's ton demand. I've tried looking find anyone willing put list. absolutely figure many people it. fully accurate course years really good idea many missed testing. could say even basic flu however. illness risk free. No, could mutate closer MERS, also coronavirus, mortality rate around 40%. Combine current longer presymptomatic spread time we're going bad time.

 


While likely, possible, become likely people infected. seems lot happening various places around country. Places would rather toss bunch doses trash means ensuring ""wrong"" person weasel way front proverbial line. Meanwhile... people still dying Covid. least right people dying much...or something... vaccine give strain COVID-19. That's works.  dont know many ways say it. square rectangle, doesnt mean rectangle square. serious reaction second dose, likely never infected. I'm saying opposite true, people didnt severe reaction get virus.  YES. Super-vaxxed ready to...make out. feeling things return semblance normal I’m going make lot friends uncomfortable unnecessarily long hugs.  Also seems trend anywhere people getting vaccinated. know numbers PA dropped drastically. Yeah get logic restriction default prove burden. Something we're forced always good justification behind it, beyond 'it's big deal'. Best Monday number yet. 3M/day go... strategy weight loss? Check clinical data. AstraZeneca around 70% efficiency strains easier significantly smaller country, though. UK paid set facilities, there's spare capacity? like Australia paid set facility that's start producing 50m doses, delivered exclusively Australia... So, according you, AZ mess failed meet targets EU, also customers too?

The mental gymnastics people willing make defend garbage company honestly surreal. I’m surprised made sense second time immune system exposed something would react strongly. wonder that’s case AZ read meaning CDC comfortable unvaccinated low risk people risking contacting covid vaccinated, comfortable unvaccinated high risk people getting covid vaccinated. low risk probably live, high risk might not. CDC simply doesn’t know yet vaccine prevents transmission (or much). 

To unvaccinated low risk people, biggest risk mild covid. Obviously healthy people still get sick. long-covid thing, even formerly healthy people. 

But think CDC sort saying people getting (mild) covid worth social isolation causes health problems too. 

I’m low risk group, won’t running around maskless around *anyone* I’m vaccinated. That’s personal choice, though. Yes true problem people taking high risk calculus applying entire population.

I'm young good health. family good health. need mask/distance certainly want I'm fully vaccinated Viruses don’t typically mutate become *more* deadly. can’t spread way. *could*, could also attenuate it’s nearly deadly. Absolutely well. Cannot wait launch big ass fireworks year. Usually family shooting competition unfortunately ammo simply shelves moment one getting postponed again. happened me. Donated MLK Day got letter 2 weeks ago found anti-bodies donation. 

My work testing regularly, except holidays. either false negative somewhere narrow window January testing started back. I'm tired hearing level headed effective NZ pandemic response is. Yeah guys may handled virus beautiful landscapes delightful accents least rest world giant crickets. addition points mentioned, don’t know babies go first year life never seeing strangers face. Luckily That’s 1,000 year type virus. That’s 200,000 years type event. That’s legitimate risk extinction event. Again, I’ve done “intense” workout mask on. It’s still intense, intensive you’d able work without mask 

Don’t read much it, signifies form workout safe within mask, myth busting people think masks cause body choke O2 sum. proving false. vaccine lasts body days degrading completely (which must stored cold temps). I'm curious think could long term side effects experts think chance negligible.  Yeah they're trying avoid coming saying 2 tier society though imo This, unironically would say careful friends want get can’t yet. Good way breed hardcore resentment, people don’t like left out. Good thing children safe COVID Agreed. I'm tired whole ""masks big deal! I'll masking years"" i'm like lmao IIRC, able start showing Moderna numbers much quickly this. think that’s probably part doesn’t really seem like reporting much issue point.  Turns stuck home SO, nowhere go stress uncertainty, finances, threat death older loved ones get engine revving. aren’t immune life catching it, it’s 3 months research. numbers looking total people caught it, people last 2-3 months. We’re getting close; detail important people back July don’t falsely think immunity.  I've shots reaction either, sore arm, maybe little tired could placebo. I'm reasonably certain never it, work home, kids remote, etc, etc.. NBA players bubble outside. Contrasted grim articles posted every day year ago, refreshing see Literally anything, would imagine AZ production capacity UK now. isn’t used supply countries Australia? Pax East week before. Yea, really quien sabe situation appreciate effort! Holy shit. like Biden. I’m saying goal stupid easy. he’s gonna like double it. says ""intense"" Good job stating literal definition. pay attention everyone else saying understood person called adult offspring children, regardless ""literal definition"" is. \~60 million people received first dose. 30 million also gotten second doses, though.  Yeah, counties still mess. several counties CA impossible get appointment still. Really luck draw. Biden setting goal 100 million doses long attained though. 

[Looks like December committed 100 million doses. team, team help get latest last 100 million COVID-19 vaccine, least 100 million COVID vaccine shots arms American people first 100 days. 100 million shots first 100 days.

This happened [three days first vaccine 

It first vaccine administered, 10 vaccines per day. So, still think easy goal commit to?   I've little weirded hearing people say they'll still wear masks social distance spending time indoors small groups everyone group fully vaccinated.

same, distancing/masks living. conversely symptoms mean covid caused damage, significant incidence lung scaring completely asytmptomatic covid patients. long term consequences even non-severe covid unclear certainly risk free. That's funny. summer less burdensome, that's sure. shortness breath steadily gotten worse since last March I'm pretty sure it. Never fever unable get tested. Stayed away work symptoms went away 24 hours went back like said. Whenever go stairs work, really tough time breathing never case before. source definition giving? would love see archive personal use.

FDA defines positive PCR test least one symptom UK tested AstraZeneca ""positive PCR test least one ""qualifying"" symptom""(high fever, cough, shortness breath, anosmia ageusia) What’s Venn diagram look like this? Vaccinated vs. Infected/Recovered  think troll idiot. looking argument, can't rule either one. either way, responding anymore. Always happy discussion people, trolling easier move on. We're making we're laughing ur stupidity Lol wtf society would fucking collapsed I'm expert stuff, guess wanna say ""vaccinated people wear masks social distance public"" moment there's still lot people vaccinated surely lot unvaccinated people go stores places like ""yup I'm totally vaccinated, worry"". parachute metaphor fits perfect name guy lmaoo 🔥🔥 Got J&amp;J Friday. I'm concerned honest. way look this: vaccines first step likely ongoing, multi-year process refinement get information. vaccines still EUA still lot know. time next year totally different place now. plan spend next several months visiting vaccinated friends/relatives trying get back semblance normality can. Hyperfocusing efficacy rates point really worth book unless super high risk. possibly state fact plenty people even tested....? CNN fearmongering headlines, name better combo. Ok, I've reapproved it. Fwiw, also removed reply breaking rule 1. nice day! also contractual obligations countries too. 

In contract EU, AZ warranted obligation would impede complete fulfillment obligations respect EU. unlikely number states still report numbers big counties like LA County still report. might close Thailand currently averaging 70 cases day (population 70 million). outbreak wanting get back low numbers 3 months ago. Hence quarantine. 145 medium, well done. added source comment finding this:
""""SARS-CoV-2 infections may present U.S. December 2019, earlier previously recognized,"" authors said."" Probably 6 7 CST. statement still asks vaccinated people wear masks public quite time (so agreeing Fauci that) explains small private gatherings entirely vaccinated peeps (or vaccinated + single household unvaccinated), masks needed confirmed cases, one realistic thinks accurate practical world. Makes nice articles guess. turned 15 today, couldn’t really much normally would. Going back school week one thing look forward to. read specifics child vaccine trials? Like many participants takes get significant result, given rarity serious illness kids? Fongool Nope Yes could see war nation Astrazenica Germany mom felt similar.
She covid back March 2020 felt flu like symptoms sore “hard” arm. 
The second shot felt mostly fine! little fatigue!
Take care would sick.
Stay home, watch tv, get rest etc. that’s mother did. think understand viruses mutate. Gain function exceedingly rare, yet bandy giving appearance know talking about, clearly don't. better say nothing thought fool open one's mouth confirm it. husband fully vaccinated best friend. want drive together play disc golf. I'm pregnant vaccinated. interpret mean cant drive friend? 4th grader son thriving remote year even kept way rest year.

However 1st grader daughter things considered bad, IEP minutes ressource tripled next year order catch little learning made remote. IEP help already tough situation lower grades. totally feel you, even case enough left school life erase year, seeing almost caught year ago going back behind classmates learned remote hurt me. Luckily back person since January fall online. 
I hope daughter gets someone understand situation put in. ....you really dont see direct link high cases today (110,000 US equivalent) long covid???? element used Pfizer’s EU manufacturing? US vaccinated everyone they'll sell developing countries. park yes, little tourist towns surrounding not. ones flooded tourists across country without mask mandate. said site isnt updating anymore good thing everyone working hard vaccine last administration. Ok you’re troll lmao  federal government tries keep control rebelling states. That’s true, polio vaccine less 95% effective still somehow drove polio essentially nonexistence, without social distancing masks everything else we’re today. problematic sounds like saying privileged enough savings, good health insurance finically security ones deserving children.

Signed, someone contracted swine flu month vaccine available general population permanent lung damage result. seeing lot sketchy vaccine stories showing covid related subs. refreshing throughout day. Currently 35k new cases today, normally complete? Wondering chance staying 40k. Great point.

In psychology, called stereotype threat, certain group stereotyped more/less capable something (or case, accepting rejecting vaccine) ends succumbing stereotype result.

If members specific ethnic group constantly told fellow group members wary vaccine, may start avoid vaccine well. Yellowstone also outside, barely matters.  found contact someone tested positive.
It doctor saw Tuesday, called today told tested positive Friday.
I waiting room get tested right now.

What really sucks doctors appointment today different doctor won’t refill prescription virtual visit. 
I go painful withdrawals without medication could end hospital. 

I getting rapid test know soon fucked I’m positive.
These rules ridiculous. people covid supposed do? headline clear None vaccines covid live virus. vaccines (chickenpox, MMR, rotovirus, certain polio vaccines) live weakened viruses even cases would pretty unusual vaccine derived virus capable spread (You hear vaccine derived polio cases countries use live polio vaccines sometimes pretty rare relative absolute number children inoculated). name mine one Abrahamatic religions start point always middle east. win rarely though.

But, idea cancer treatments may change effective vaccine personally. immunosuppressed, protection could less 95%. not. think specifically studied. another vaccinated person much, much less likely spread unvaccinated person. making decisions myself, would probably still avoid unvaccinated people ok seeing vaccinated people. hide bodies?

Now hemorrhagic fever somehow could survive air? would win plague inc!

Edit: also deadly disease usually harder spread people likely bed ridden start viral shedding. It’s one reason SARS less dangerous overall since people contagious showed symptoms. Yes, you’re absolutely right. guarantee author article homework.

That's huge chunk probably take least month get through. Possibly less considering many food service staff 20-somethings really care shot. Friend's brother who's got part-time gig bartender said he'll get vaccine shot site convenient. He's going drive hour away waste another couple hours waiting line it. get it, he's 24 concerned getting hurt auto accident covid. Every NZ thread ready worry whenever wake tickle throat 😩 Where’s data mitigates spread? movie pretty realistic many stuff, especially Hollywood, it’s high death rate combined short incubation period (like 48 hours - considering woman died immediately upon return business trip, colleague Tokyo) would make hard spread. seen lower school outbreaks NYC? Sorry must missed that. J&amp;J data referring to? family opposite. may get rejected gotten vaccine. believe Bill Gtes Democrts trying mind control people via microchps insanity. Sorry, ""locals"" problem taking tax revenue seasonal income snowbirds often homes states, reside nearly half year.

I really problem people go state every year significant part year getting vaccine.

This different people crossing state borders ""vaccine tourists"" sole purpose getting dose.  wear one every day; definitely uncomfortable, makes harder human connection/read people's faces, doubt. I'm saying drawbacks minor compared benefits.  school UW system never fully closed person. I’ve still least 1 person class since beginning pandemic. guess, something along lines of: ""Black people less successful world stupider."" book, 99.95 certainty counts definitely. want quibble, that's problem. expect sudden self-awareness end. Well played. Obviously depends definition means ""work"" many people feel cost lockdown would expect far fewer deaths. Especially compare states/countries lockdown, number seem much different they're different all. another childless person, embarrassing gross. Also, absolute audacity comment parents enjoying 24/7 time child (on planet would normal person enjoy that??) also expressing extreme disdain children parents. can't eliminate reactogenicity. natural immune system response. me, someone know got antibody test weeks traveling back home Florida (they live Colorado, neighborhood) gone see family, mid February, 2020, tested positive coronavirus antibodies.

As far know, traveled people home outside family returning home getting antibody test.  Literally yeah, someone always refuse vaccine csll around enough you’ll get one likely we'll hit one major tipping points upon methane increases uncontrollably. gentle incline. yeah that's lame. put masks pics dating apps lol. weird.
 know people sent new Save Dates due pushing wedding COVID new pictures masks quote saying want first kiss like haha. think that's fine making light things postponed due shitty cirumstances. went mega site Burlington. App asked that. Outside asked driver's license insurance card. pretty much it, went quickly overall pretty awesome. like 25 minutes. NOOOOOO WANT STAY INSIDE studies specifically study whether people spread know literally every vaccine immune/asymptomatic greatly reduces spread. We’ve known almost year now.... wonder is?  designating national day getting damn vaccines rolled faster? Yep, 100% agreed. I’ve made appointments parents bunch older relatives PA. It’s hard, figure pharmacy websites dump appointments pretty common knowledge vaccine forums Facebook, nextdoor etc. websites pretty user friendly I’ve found faster make appointments older, less tech savvy people rather talk time crunch. anyone waiting someone call one day offer vaccine, that’s works. least yet. worries. Happens best us! very. really ever done, blockade one country group countries still usually regarded act war.

A million foreigners probably Brazil given time, add temporary visitors, expats, dual nationality. generally afforded rights point view foreign country people live others, includes right denied entry. definitely doesn't. We're going get rid COVID-19, going become part many virus manage. Treatments get better, huge swaths population immune. really big deal literally 0% population protected it.

We'll establish baseline immunity summer we'll manage going forward. lot less scary far fewer people vulnerable. Lots people whining.

I’ll take confirmed less confirmed days, it’s “actual” doesn’t make significant milestone. paid money hit hard. get done help others. Like say airplane ""put oxygen mask first helping others."" well last part matter unless worried plan forever wear masks.

and yes believe long COVID real got vaccine claim reduction symptoms. We’re getting close 100 million vaccinated surge it’s gonna big. Dunno, using ""democracy"" reason something right thing persuasive. Democracy completely capable making wrong decisions. needs informed, engaged population trustworthy sources information order work.

If someone says ""here's reasons idea fail"" response ""yeah popularity contest"", surely that's obviously persuasive argument. Except data showing vaccines mitigate spread protect infections, making vaccinated unmasked individual lower risk masked vaccinated individual 1. Ok, quoting guy me. Touche.
2. presumably folks getting ***redistributed*** vaccines getting benefit.
3. See #2 misspelled March epidemiological standpoint even 40% population vaccinated help eradicate virus. variants transmissible proof getting harder virus transmit. virus trouble transmitting mutates transmissible trade less lethal. Vaccines wipe viruses necessarily mean everyone needs vaccinated. many times counting people died? 1:1?  Thank you! understand it. It'd one thing odd surprise recommendation give one dose, known months. made simple update account songle-dose regimen begin reporting day 1? guess missed memo. That's England. response differ 4 nations. Scotland sort plan return normal 😞 I'm hoping political maneuvering SNP look responsible upcoming elections, fear they're legitimately looking zero COVID seem signaling. would impossible without cooperation nations course, can't imagine realize that. think CDC cares death hospital overload vaccine known extremely effective stopping happening. still come mild case vaccination, though (mild terms covid often sicker felt life) known whether still get long covid vaccination. girlfriend 5 years broke january 2020. fully expecting hot boy summer fun 2020 :/ quite generalization making here. kids thrived remote setting. majority teachers I've worked enjoyed teaching remotely. 

One biggest complaints I've teacher given nearly enough time complete everything comes teacher. benefits remote teaching schedule hope carry over. district made Wednesdays planning/support day. done wonders teacher workload. greatest fear go back exactly things pandemic. haven’t told happen. covid GPA 4.1, semester 3.8 threshold qualified for. guess longer qualify. ""cheating"", anti-maskers going whatever feel like point. dad's old-school mechanic pandemic masks customers one on. None mechanics wear masks inside repair shop. Go Newport Beach Huntington SoCal lucky see 1/4 ppl masking waiting line take out. ppl DGAF covid point. They're going make excuses vaccinated. article heartbreaking.

I hope able negotiate school keep scholarship.

She’s alone, helps particular situation. 

The virus killed many people broke spirit many more. UK US also don’t allow export vaccines. EU relatively charitable regard. Phase 3 accounted symptomatic people. Also, didnt study whether vaccinated people still spread others. mean students grades increased able take tests open book internet Won’t somebody please think children?! 3 weeks almost negligible Pfizer supply Uk.

Do watch Government briefings? knew this, told everyone it. Supplies pick next week. There's nasty EU conspiracy here. 23M 6’6” bad hairline. roll baby read stories like went 210 153 it!

Best luck daughter, fuck school taking away scholarships kids go difficult year.  agree you. able get vax want. Thought point free markets. honestly know banned logistics get enough due demand. problem Russia since mom there.

We seem trouble buying crap China good vax another story. Could something NYSE corporate profits? Politics? Man wish could see future  found pregnant second child March 13, 2020. also day remember like “oh shit, things getting really bad.” didn’t get pregnant did, highly doubt would another child right pregnant/trying. know plenty people pregnant got pregnant did, though. “we’re still adding appointments” message means haven’t opened site registrations yet... that’s usually around 6am Thanks, think people like beat already down.

Doesn’t cut ways? Meaning covid-19 struggle turn mundane cold (from baseline deadlier “baseline” flus) much hampers mutations become OG SARS. probably heard phrase ""brevity soul wit""? Well, they're exact opposite that. lot places premature. would remove something simple mask-mandate actual head CDC asking people wait bit longer. said, soon everything. think time concrete discussions restrictive states move forward thing improve. live IL strict gathering limits (50 people) need addressed soon, even addressed future dates going coming this, things moving right direction, plans happen summer fall need start made, decimated convention, theater, entertainment industry make plans resume future, people plan things like weddings, bat mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, etc. larger gatherings often involve rental halls. furbabies. We've comparing Sundays Sundays like 9 months now.  Beep mention economic concerns widespread job loss. people know dying, wonder you’ll next. That, Cuomo Newsom's shenanigans stopped. health officials even called restrictions loosened entire year? I’ve heard calls schools reopen, that’s it. course kids’ education important, isn’t survival businesses too? people’s mental health? course none concerns apply mask mandates states sensibly kept place now.

It makes sense loosen business restrictions cases lower months prioritized vaccinations ensure cases occur today won’t result much risk healthcare workers many deaths would before. Remember China made bunch original whistleblowers disappear December 2019 didn’t let thing figure going Wuhan beginning 2020? Yeah, Chinese reaction I’m talking screwed rest world over. China’s fault, reaction flawed, also due poor hygienic practices wet markets already caused many unnecessary deaths diseases cause many more. Never forget that. Masks up, spread.

Now one real egregious parts story one bar $150 bottles Grey Goose. Like clockwork, republicans suddenly care debt Dem charge. Certainly didnt care Trump raised debt president history announcement, assumed NZ going use J&amp;J vaccine.

TV shows 20+ hour games, movies don’t much story-wise anymore. short. NY, BMI 30 gets vaccine. Lots people eligible idea. India's vaccine truly excellent Yeah got second shot Friday wife gets second shot couple weeks. 

We wanted go San Diego zoo read website ages 2 need mask even vaccinated. get gah. feels like nothing change. 


I’m hoping time there’s enough vaccines walk Walgreens get one nobody required wear mask social distance. people don’t want get vaccinated that’s them. issue guess would kid children can’t get vaccine even wanted one. confirm, mom works school. Every teacher fully vaccinated district. live mask mandate ends Wednesday I've seen multiple gyms post longer require them. fine people TWiV said proofreading system serious flaws. I'd settle complete eradication herd immunity day. :) Yes, comes receiving vaccine without choice vaccine received, please get one. choice, proceed see fit. cost big deal. $20 dose could vaccinate whole world $300B, 16% price current US stimulus bill. Alternatively, 35 fully vaccinated people per $1400 check

The problem production speed Last heard, general public study less 1000 people. true? Lets wait everyone wants actually get vaccine, open everything up. amazon. please go pharmacies doctors like drugs mask, 1-5 mask, amazingly proven effective. New York opened up, been, stretch imagination. Restaurant's 0% capacity worst back December/January. large gatherings, theaters closed.

Conversely, look Florida. Open 100% way better New York.

New York going severely pay (monetarily) future. Cuomo ruined state. Confirmed cases change erratically depending tested recently. Hospital admissions &amp; deaths reliable &amp; important stats. Oh yes, agree looking good. give road ahead uphill. believe there's room change development avoid end (at least medium term). Everyone pulls gym get air drink water Yeah I'm fine masks becoming generally normalized something sick, maybe cold outside something. would rather requirements businesses mandates go away sometime soon especially vaccination happening rate going at. feel like vaccines changing things seems like anything terms changing policy. Hopefully people get guess estimates actual number infections could 10 27 times higher number cases confirmed testing

There 30 million confirmed US cases. 330 million people US. 

If ""actual"" number 10 times higher, basically everyone covid. 27 times higher approaching everyone three times. 3 vaccinations prevented hospitalization death efficiency 100%.

Implying one vaccine better another one ""wait best vaccine"" disingenuous misleading. singular best vaccine. know what's best? getting hospitalized covid dying.

We need support vaccine effort right ever. misinformation since vaccine effort ramped impacted vaccine efforts especially low income communities certain ethnic minorities. groups inherent mistrust medicine due past negative experiences Healthcare system ironically also hardest hit virus. 

I've personally cared dozens patients died covid, dozens prolonged hospitalizations may never again. someone wait extra days weeks ""best vaccine"" risk getting virus get available vaccine today? saying makes sense public health perspective. purely speculative quite honestly dangerous. Go easy - one replying possible solutions! :) It’s good enough New Zealand....Rocks.  AFAIK due harsh cooling requirements Pfizer vaccine interesting many developed third world countries. Funny quickly things improve replace incompetent man child functioning adult  10-27 times higher would like multiple times population US upper range scale. 10 times higher would almost 300,000,000 without specifying state capital, isn't. Especially context there's anything wrong that... What? It’s opposite, side effects commonly severe second shot Okay so. GGD nhs. large vaccine centres many cities.
GPs vaccinate arent mobile afaik, old folks homes carehomes often vaccinate too. GGD counts vaccinations rest constant additions theyre centralised organ. GGD done 1.1 far, rest around 400k theyve started recently Maybe visit r/collapse? regular contributers competent discuss goengineering you.

But looking good.

edit : bite head off, disagree. lot take in, acceptance process. Awesome lah! true general sense universally, obvious exceptions asymptomatic COVID infections RemindMe! 3 weeks

I think right :) Given Asian countries wearing masks long time covid ever started obviously big deal hope sticks bunch non-covid related reasons. want live poor country even Asian neighbors take seriously, communist regime obviously lying you, that's call. Also, say Colorado, did. don’t think it’s x27 would mean 810 million Americans 330 million Americans.

However, think it’s pretty fair estimate total infections based total deaths estimated IFR. IFR 0.5% ~500k COVID-19 deaths, would mean ~100 million infections. Given hard get vaccines

It's easy get vaccine teacher New York. I'm OP-just trying help! understand would frustrating elsewhere. Yeah right first paragraph. think sure vast minority though they're free want. really hope point soon masks required outside travel/mass public transport. Hopefully way get around vaccinated people, faking vaccine cards probably become quickly huge business lol Haha yeah, everything I've read seems really unnecessary long outside keep good distance (both true jog), seems like neighborhood taken real turn restrictive. I'm glad we're keeping safe, honestly getting yelled running really scared one thing (small woman yelled big dude) also bummer. 

I generally conscientious keeping social distance, mask wearing, etc...I seen family year...haven't gathered friends indoors year....etc etc. plenty folks guy could effectively yelled at!

No, that’s ignorance - like guy said. make bad decision bad data you’re ignorant. stupid knowing data still making wrong call.

Also there’s emotions involved, empathy people medical anxiety? people get anxious even taking simple OTC medications signed get first dose week state opened food workers. feel bit guilty employed full time food worker, work week food bank essential volunteer. gotta say, news fact two Biontech founders Turkish origin...the Turks really hittin' park vaccination.

Bravo! Austria nearing 500k bought doses...yay, guess.

:| really do. I’m sure there’s even Covid test one right next used panty one somewhere Tokyo Right...China gets free pass why, virus started there, covered weeks, including investigation? Lol. Trump charged crimes humanity well, misleading American people severity Covid order 'protect them""?  Austrians outbreak Tyrol?  South Africa? Heck, let's string every politician leads country outbreaks variants get with. 

The problem politicians doctors - tell people want hear get elected. self-righteous, self-appointed altruistic Redditors want results? Fuck downvotes. Start advocating medical professionals put charge lockdowns mask mandates. Punishing politicians politicians effective thinking ridding society devil burning heretics stake. LMAO There's always going 'leftover' vaccine warmed entirely needed official groups, get no-shows prepared doses for. Since policy never let go waste grab whoever nearby, might health staff, volunteers, or, since official nearby people already got leftover doses, Abby gave grandfather lift, Barry walking past door. 

You talk GP GP receptionist see get appointment, could visit local vaccination centre towards end day ask, might say might say wait see. asthma might excuse need. Make sure NHS number you, polite, whine, wear mask, prepared wait still get one. mean. suspect non trivial number people choose mask public covid longer crisis, minority. It'll also depend live.

Government mandates go away eventually. agree posters though. Masks last longest transportation airports. hahah. Exactly. gonna say... Japanese sure LOVE vending machines. Wow - heard level surveillance US. state in? Would fully support CA! almost nothing Russia lol. terrible medical education country haha. think people accept forever means, though may normalized encouraged wear feeling sick, flu/sickness season, certain crowded public places, etc. far mandates go, though, certain end sometime summer. 

Also, remember main purpose stop spread entirely. Masks even that. people (lol) keep mind purpose masks slow spread overwhelm healthcare facilities. Even \*if\* virus still transmissible vaccine (which believe there's solid evidence of), point vaccine protect people severe cases Covid, hospitalization death (which evidence far things). virus going ever go away, eventually managed like viruses. governors lift mandates cases fall certain numbers (50 cases less per 100,000 people contingency state, Ohio, get rid health orders - Gov. DeWine one first act mandates) general public access vaccine whenever want it, must hold accountable. strongly believe would protests backlash. sub gets worse worse every day. Smh head found last month vaccinated last summer! Another anecdote: I'm physician worked person patients (outpatient clinic) full year, never got formal COVID, Moderna, first shot sore, second shot knocked flat butt day two. (as counterpoint exposed COVID). suppose longer immunologically naive, first shot like 'booster' body primed strong response spike proteins made body mRNA. Exactly, whole thing infuriating. say “no?” possible say won’t foreign attendants Japanese government open borders? what? It’s that. New Zealand getting queue. Pfizer taking orders time ( note Israel ordered received enough vaccinate entire country already). Pfizer take warp speed development money shipping worldwide sometime.

Then question country without coronavirus get vaccine someplace like Mexico Brazil losing thousands people week disease. AFAIK Australia already got 300000 doses delivery stopped would 250000 . Afterwards beginning end March Australia supposed get AZ vaccines produces domestically. got 300000 expected 550000 doses AZ vaccines produced EU. proportionally EU even expected get Q1. AZ reduced planned deliveries EU 80 million 40 million. currently really sure even meet target 40 million. Dang, alright. Thanks! wrong mostly feel bad kids whose parents can't stand find date nights fulfilling think stores large public venues gyms keep mask requirements lot longer people expect. I’m expecting “better safe sorry” approach places want protected type liability keeping mask requirements around, even they’re really enforced. Hows argument going? Whos winning? await headline Los Angeles purchases enough vaccine entire city. Please report comments break sub-rules mods review them. Hell yeah! 

Just remember places reporting yesterday's numbers, Sundays slow. let's look tomorrow's numbers too! Honest [diety], people rise stupid. lower that. even read article? United States part quoted following United States recorded 66,000 new cases day last week, according Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), 73 percent apex reached early January similar levels transmission October. **But precipitous decline late January early February plateaued recent days, raising fears new wave around corner.**

If going fact check least informed. Don’t bother, Reddit people think know everyone else. It’s epitome confidently incorrect mindset.

You’re right, yet people won’t care care appearing holier thou.  brightest price guidance CDC delivered year. 

Nobody follows CDC guidelines day day lives (outside Covid, mean), either way, organization whose job preach caution. really fantastic.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* addition fully vaccinated. How reliable &amp; trustworthy is global Covid data

I'm looking at the numbers on the Covid overlay on Google Maps - which come from Wikipedia - and I'm wondering how reliable those numbers are. I know some countries have a history of fudging their numbers on things, but I also know that international statisticians and data modelers are accustomed to that, and are able to make some pretty good models with unreliable or incomplete data. I'm sure the accuracy varies depending on the country and the available data, of course.

Specifically, my sister intends to travel to Tunisia (from Minnesota) in a few months. (Let's ignore all the obvious reasons why that's a bad idea.) However, the data shows that Tunisia has almost 3 times fewer cases than MN right now, and most of Africa seems to be doing quite well, which is bit surprising.

Is that data reliable, or at least a reasonably good ballpark idea of the actual numbers? ethical reasons. 

There's study underway, year later. - vaccine approvals. Fully vaccinated 2 weeks second shot right? ""others low risk"" applies non-vaccinated people. also visit non-vaccinated, low-risk people without restrictions. man got vaccine secret (while knowing cult-like status), yet continues promote anti-science anti-mask sentiments among followers - knowingly killing zero remorse. think 'political bullshit' understated. Let’s gooooo. Finally. Perfect statement CDC. Hopefully high risk people taking extra precautions anyway though, present.... *OR*... *FUCKIN HOPEFULLY*... They've already vaccinated. gonna encourage people get vaccine. Get vaccine go back normal! Duh half true Fully-vaccinated people also visit one household, even they're fully partially vaccinated, non-vaccinated low-risk group live low-risk group. 

Fully-vaccinated people need quarantine, period, even they're exposed COVID. really want feel depressed, look comments default sub pertaining large gatherings/sports games/bars right now. Hundreds comments talking people going bars ""literally killing thousands"" zero hint irony tons smug condemnation human interaction. painfully clear majority redditors persistently online (tm) folks unwilling move long time.

Anthony Fauci Nothing bring lion kind people going mask-free parties mask burnings people isolated last year. seem be, really hard tell much going behind closed doors. number cases dropping 25% week past two months though, lockdown working.

I’m thinking they’ll sizable amount population “strict” states want masks stick around post-vaccination, lot people 50/50 see unwinnable argument follow along, means significantly ease physical distancing. well sort amigo, tourism ~5-6% NZ's GDP. populace vaccinated, they're going able open tourists. Obviously use number confirmed cases. Many people contracted virus. It'll general public time get shots+immunity. guess June July. they? adjunct vaccinated, don’t believe that’ll necessary. Especially vaccines increase next year. Remember ""flatten curve?"" 

That may well best reasonably hope for. Suppression levels might make little ill couple days, severe levels (or kill you).

Get people immunized ""enough"" prevent major illness. Giving twice many folks 1st shot may smarter 1/2 many getting 2 shots current schedule (Pfizer Moderna). That's UK .. far seems working. 

Yeah, give second dose still, maybe 6 weeks (Pfizer) ?? (Moderna), unless current studies (we're smart enough them, right?) show 1 dose yields ""adequate"" protection. interesting studies part original trials.

We're probably gonna need booster shots anyway, especially variants. 

I wonder many immunologists would agree/disagree ... scientific level, political. Oh, god's sake, thread article *Brazil*. wanna talk horses, whatever, surprised get weird looks middle math class.
Sorry, getting ridiculous. Article - ""Fully-vaccinated Americans gather vaccinated people indoors without wearing mask social distancing""


This waaaay less restrictive expected. Friggin AWESOME.

Read whole article, I'm going check links make sure good true. needlessly process vaccinating people need patient little longer. realize patient long time people sacrificed lot others, literally middle protecting vulnerable people want quit now. parents vaccinated, know people 60s 80s younger people cancer survivors still waiting appointments, state vaccinating pretty quickly. Lol people keep saying US government get them. expected result. Don’t forget used DPA get Merck-J&amp;J deal done setting FEMA vaccination sites even ARA passed. Could possible many people infected could get vaccinated. people die COVID, happen week. happens course 4+ weeks often. Deaths typically lagging indicator, surprised see drop sharply soon. think violent agreement. I'm fully vaccinated flying Florida week.

Who tf going want baby overly qualified, earning 1000€ month either living parents spending 80% small apattment big city.

In case missed article Covid response Minister also said this.

  ""Options could include delaying delivery New Zealand, order free supply countries short-term, donating spare vaccines countries"", Hipkins said. Except ""hypoxic training"" meant done people already good shape (90% US population) Less restrictive thought would be. 

Freedom NIGH people! go work every day, office. teacher’s environment shown anymore risk professions. Please don’t lecture covid risks. 

Also teachers prioritised vaccine distribution (unlike professions). fact still trying stay home, jumping queue get vaccinated, obscene. bigger concern increases chances worse variant mutating. might include something resistant vaccine, deadly, easily transmissible etc.

As expected beginning, we'll done Christmas. I’ve running mask months can’t wait don’t wear anymore see strong lungs lol I'm fully vaccinated flying Florida week.

The advice ""do resonably avoid people. Also wear mask. mix bubbles"". 

The advice ""If leave house even 30 seconds deserve die."" far fewer 92 million Americans vaccinated.

One small semantic correction: fewer 92 million Americans *fully* vaccinated. One dose two dose vaccine still provide level inoculation.  interesting happens Covid cases Texas. case big deal they're probably factually correct. observation media whole.

Also, no, lot people really pay attention stuff like do. clue difference case, confirmed case even probable case is.  seems pessimistic, Spain summer relatively normal low case numbers.

If 50% population jabs coupled better weather think it'll close normal life. Australia also significantly smaller population US. China, know they're underreporting numbers; mention, government far capable actually enforcing lockdown America.

You say ""braindead,"" notice never said impossible America it; saying *more* bad administration caused worse America. felt tired hour first Pfizer shot. arm started feel stiff around time well. lasted two days. opinion. long force opinion upon others, fine.

I think CDC want vaccinated interact at-risk people small gatherings without mask. They’re ok low-risk people.. well, presumable getting (mild) covid. Agreed. it’s truly exciting watch interpretations form around history lived through, 20 years later. Fantastic. open back return sense normalcy people go bankrupt lives ruined? I’m shocked many vaccinated people still avoiding simple activities connections like this.  


That's lot laws work.... hell every religion works last checked. Dogmatism. recall saw stated? I'd like know that. I'm getting second shot weekend I'm honestly dreading stoked first round. felt bad enough first round chills fever, everything hear says second shot worse. I'm expecting write weekend recovering.

Huh

Is satire? Even CDC gives blessing! Also good idea show China possible push back without necessarily threatening violence. small sparsely populated island country South Pacific hit first much less contagious strain virus. TBF first world nation winning lottery ticket, New Zealand's one hardest win! city double population, yet China/India probably zones within cities reach near 5mil. Pandemic: 500 virus bucks unlock ability develop variants escape vaccination natural antibodies! want purchase DLC? 
 
Brazil: hey mom, buy something phone game? toddler version capitol riots post say ""won"" internet argument, basically? Sure say so, seen husband guess 🤣 I’m cool tax hike reverse giant corporate ones dished past years hammer dwindling middle class again. realistically pre Covid paying cause things fine economically. Instead cut hell taxes leaving us strapped things hit fan. Nah complicated change developer perspective. what's point toothless restrictions? Something sit right knowing hand obscene fines businesses comply guidelines, ultimately stop individuals breaking guidelines. Right, can't rely honor system else we'd never needed mask mandate begin with. I'm (partially) vaccinated complain wearing mask grocery another 2-3 months get large majority vaccinated. Yes. moreover there’s step you’re missing individual vaccinated eradicating virus entirely: society whole largely vaccinated. 22 play flip cup dirty college basement friends 3 Wednesday stroll 9:00 Thursday without missing beat. can’t anymore real world. College happens once, it’s special. think mask mandates lift stores lift restrictions dead easy get vaccine. Free, documentation, available nearly everywhere. 

At point, think vulnerable cannot accept vaccine reason advised wear N95, perhaps. 

The unvaccinated left pass covid around. great, can’t see life masks indefinitely.

I live Florida, maybe perception people put sake people’s health skewed. country ""reopens"" fully, witness economic surge unlike come before. DOW could easily reach 60k higher. thinking may see golden era celebration fortune, maybe overly-optimistic. little longer till sub finally dies Yes. states federal government (as snowbirds coming states well) taking account, isn’t issue. fact locals complaining article done, would indicate happening local authorities would easily report snowbirds population taken account. 100% main reason. Line skipping putting vulnerable harm would control told AMERICANs peoples getting vaccine gave ability wave middle finger everyone else.. basically. People died vaccinated, that's expected among tens thousands seniors. sources showing anyone died covid reasonable time vaccinated, immunity kicked in? here’s thing...if open go back “normal” likely think would we’d able achieve required ~70% herd immunity? Doubtful many would shrug leave us susceptible another outbreak original variant. No? Half million people dead. Millions irreversible physical damage even know full ramifications yeah. reality pretty depressing sometimes. Especially could prevented even people masked, washed hands, distanced. decision part EU vaccination scheme looking good. enough data conclusively say one way another. tools, skills knowledge epidemiologists statistical modelers hand.

I'd trust people articulate reasoned hypothesis based that, though. Source? current theory human population plummeted around 2,000 people

That sounds wonderful Minor risk? lmao. kids school able see friends family. Point public compliance is, sooner things loosen up. simple concept evaded many people. lol Data Brazil shows 100% hospitalization deaths. 78% mild cases. So, stop fake news. Ah.... daily average Biden took office million day. Even stayed speed would occurred less year. 



1.3 million day Biden took lost every time. Although wanted play lately cause reasons Joe Biden miracle worker! want say galactic empire USA close areas one case open areas zero cases. would come ahead compared human made disaster. far delivered less 10 percent agreed covid vaccines European Union

Citation needed. get COVID vaccine? 10 year old child get COVID vaccine? COVID variants landscape look like 2 months now? effective today's vaccines variants 2 months now? Nobody really knows. Politicians routinely make promises can't keep. kind leadership backfires easily. going science-based, know, simply admit know instead putting made-up dates. Considering China, Australia, NZ basically negligible deaths clearly done size country system. 

Then there's many successes Asia/Oceania. Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, etc.

The braindead excuses pretty tiresome really giving terrible response easy way out. Sounds like get hell free card tbh  There's also substantial evidence significant factor ""asymptomatic spread"" ""presymptomatic spread."" Viral load patients remain asymptomatic far smaller people develop symptoms, viral load grows substantial levels presymptomatic people develop symptoms. vaccine prevents 95% symptomatic cases going put big dent ability people spread it, even SOME, fewer, asymptomatic cases remain. arm pain headache side effects, got Moderna one. weirdest part pain doesn’t go away Advil, sudden it’s gone. go barely able move arm it’s week old bruise, next thing know it’s barely tender all. didn’t get mine dominant arm, I’m glad didn’t. would useless two days 18-39 year old 60 BMI nearly chance survival healthy BMI 40-49 year old. read graph science said needed follow current restrictions another year, two years, more, would you?

Lmao... try last 250 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree honest front, whole point stop public devouring old jumping line get back lives. 58 youngest graduated high school. glad going spend year, college, watch her. think matured quite bit away. high school sure interesting! know lot people got painful/sore arm first jab. felt kind cruddy - achy tired day two. Tylenol made feel lot better. feeling fine soon! :) yay?

anyway, im glad it’s lower.

every day seems least minor improvement sometimes huge improvement.

i’ve fascinated watching amounts graph every day ANYWHERE free beer amazing. London icing cake. accused ""tribal mentality"" ""taking sides"" clear anti-masker past weekend here. (The mods ended deleting anti-masker's comments, essentially proving right declaring victor argument, saying!)

I suppose accusation true all. part ""faction"" believes masks work. anyone trying spin data incorrectly claim masks work, definitely wrong (and 99% chance purpose) know right bat wrong. Even know *why* wrong. Even even read links evidence claim providing, still know wrong, every single time.

Masks work.

Sorry say this. feel like may one last chances say something like since masks going away really soon vaccinations.  think issue skews allocations.

Only states chooses ignore effects snow birds allocations. state allocating snow birds without actually taking account much used snow birds, that's State. natural result snow birds showing legally using vaccines. **Did mean: Native American tribes North America?** Florida

Oh they’re definitely fans There's thing called strategy though. literally none. cordons. time close area one case. Hell, zero case areas could go stadiums travel normal lives. Also, would cheap free compared chose throw millions effected areas get closes actual lockdowns. mystery viruses work. choose allow got 530,000 dead encounting year crap economy boot. Yeah coronavirus earlier pandemic wasn’t tested boyfriend already tested positive wasn’t able get testing facility. day 1 year ago kid free Disney Cruise. I've home 4 2 year old ever since. Also kiddos totally stressed out. seen friends indoors year, can't go school, can't attend prom birthday parties. Literally everyone needs vacation right now. Everybody's little stir crazy, summer's coming. bias one way another, either optimistic pessimistic. optimistic, government comes gets shots every arm, get rid restrictions. pessimistic, see new more-infectious strains coming know we're winning battles, it'll long war.

Reality somewhere between. That's epidemiology _science_ rely _observations_ _data_.

Everything sum probabilities. I'm sure we'd like 100% freedom 0% people getting sick, chances somewhere away extremes. Vaccination prevents disease, remove restrictions. Opening increase disease spread, best done gradually, monitor statistics see happens. New strains may make people sick, monitor well, see vaccines holding it, maybe get boosters people.

I see much tide turning, rather end.

I downvote response even agree you; believe downvotes irrelevant responses, unproductive argumentation, trolling, stuff like that. optimistic side. Great! use optimism. Yeah, game design iterative. example opposite, minigames loading screens patented Namco mid-90s basically seen since. patent expired 6 years ago, 20 years iterations lost point worth quick loading becoming. also worry others states real plan getting lockdowns end restrictions place months longer makes sense. Again, sign coherent national plan. thought that, vaccinated people could go back normal.

Its already obvious think vaccinated people go back normal, problem create 2-tiered society vaccine fully available. Already problem EU young people super-hyper pissed can't get vaccine vaccine passports coming out. pandemic going provide academic psychologists material centuries come. people care CDC guidelines. country hanging waiting even though media making big deal it. people get vaccine, know good gets, go life come may. go bunker rest life.  10 WHOLE DAYS?!?! here! worked! revolted. Thank incredibly wise words Keep ledge dude 💙 twins (9 months old). I'm 35 husband 37. backs always hurt. Haha. honestly bad. Yet! :) covid still circulating prevalently population. worry polio smallpox drove entirely nearly entirely society mass vaccination. vaccine 95% effective means reduces risk 95% relative risk unvaccinated person situation you. background risk still high, may situations 5% background risk still much - instance, case high risk person like 30 year old cancer patient yet gotten vaccine. I’m grown adult low risk, intend continue wearing masks around *everyone* (even vaccinated) I’m vaccinated. know I’m going get push back vaccinated friends family (especially since armed CDC “advice” what’s ok *me*), that’s it’s going be. 

If think risk covid child risk you’d like take, I’d stay strong convictions get wishy washy. 

I believe vaccine trials going children right now, think vaccinating kids happen soon, maybe even later year! check Walgreens scheduling system. It’s awesome. think mass vax good need get primary care physicians start poking people come stuff. That’s gonna get bunch people fence don’t care. rest world needs build wall around Brazil already monoclonal antibodies give first week. Yeah, second dose worse people since first dose preps immune system. People already covid kind already ""first dose"" way. studies saying one dose enough people confirmed covid infection current recommendation everyone keep dosing schedule. without rolling economy fucked. Us, everyone sound like husband, ha! He's annoyed signed up. I'm really eligible - specific caveats (I'm NY) profs must teaching person healthcare providers direct care. also lots people know license job fully telecommuting gotten I've tortured since January lol. better goal would 330M fully vaccinated adults. become concern well. could kids get vaccinated sucks. Math? like stocks, matter much green portfolio up, counts sell stock. That’s don’t get people say it’s conservatives wearing masks. 
 
It's tell-tale sign somebody limousine liberal, actually spent time underprivileged urban areas they'd know mask usage issues definitely conservative white people thing. that. Although mRNA good vaccines, production hard scale up. contrast subunit vaccines (usually) much easier produce mRNA adenovirus. example paper last summer described vaccine candidate (RBD-Fc) 10 micrograms required 2 doses. yields gram per liter CHO cell culture. 1 cubic meter bioreactor enough antigen vaccinate hundreds millions people... country Pfizer delivered 1/10 far. Orders one thing, actual deliveries remain seen.

But current situation, Pfizer prioritize Europe. New Zealand 26 deaths. Europe half million deaths thousands die every day. Middle eastern Europe currently hell earth regions. Sounds like check news site often then. Hatred hobby grown tiresome US.

The majority time checked CNN last year, fear mongering garbage. look every day, 30 40 time looked, almost always exaggerated headline another new ""grim milestone"" whenever Covid related. first shot people already covid similar effects second shot people covid. bad effects first shot immune system already primed, thus strong response. That's kind news like see. Interestingly, EU mandate public health matters, largely failed secure PPE beginning era.

It _given_ mandate procure vaccines. Good point, I'm gonna set etsy shop now. problem done month two sooner. Oh yeah, ""not easily transmissable person person? truly admirable science there. 

As saying, free pass China Reddit. heroes also want frozen fish US probed source outbreak Wuhan, even allow proper investigation virus origins. Keep blowing sunshine asses... Youre going culture shock bit. know lot feel like know temporary. weeks couple months youll good. Back off, Yeti stalker. vaccinated folks walking/running crowded park? Mask mask? potential harm never zero. four weeks, drive kids hang indoors grandparents first time year, there’s huge potential harm... form car accident kills whole family drive up. Or, could eaten bear something.

Every activity involves taking acceptable risks order enjoy life. CDC saying risks acceptable. would say “good money” average fresh college grad there? sub likes pretend understands numbers yet challenges actual experts. anti-science Trump supporting anti-maskers. Oh ok. duty care future generation extend mass murdered. Got it. think means still transmit even fully vaccinated: need keep following safety measures public.

But, allow people visit family unvaccinated members. think safe (although safer), think emotional toll seeing family bigger risk health. Moreover, less people would become vaccinated, which, turn, would result less safe society. Don’t know? athlete gets coronavirus it’s career ender. 

I swear people treat shit like it’s measles Nowhere near high 10x longer. case, almost 90% people US COVID point.

 “I like cruises, lot fun, therefore they’re bad environment!” 

If want shopping malls, restaurants, etc, go local neighborhood support community, instead rotten corporations kill planet. Yeah others said 65+ first ones get vaccinated... Everyone end March. Contact local doctors office they'll know put you. might able parents sure. 100 years ago cars weren’t widely available. plan car wasn’t norm 100 years ago? Ha. I'll give hard time that. Thanks! hear lot people say this. covid scare actual, mild case Covid, highly doubt people actually it, unless loss smell. feel Covid even mild level incredibly strange Biden said 100M first 100 days. Problem already ramped 1M per day Trump. yes absolutely would hit milestone simply nothing. way ahead. get kick fighting vaccination card ticket family Thanksgiving, Karen. well idea lot people would sex slip birth control. sums problem nutshell. People zero capacity nuance. mean ZERO.  also want know this. Also...it sounds like eligible. least state. are, go get it. &lt;3 - someone even eligible-ish I’m down! still arguing point, ha. thing find saying multiple times is:

I pointed wrong schools closed due lack funding along trying falsely claim said schools closed tried argue schools don’t need money. 

All show incorrect. everyone disagrees schools getting additional funding. 

Again, never suggested schools shouldn’t get money. Pay say don’t need want, 

Never said that. Pay it’s waste breath. well 

Again, whole argument reduced lies deflecting attempt simply save face? Progressive taxation though, earn everyone else cover cost.

Makes far functional society asking earn least pay equal expenses. You’re never going get true experiment 100% prove causation, would wildly unethical. doesn’t mean there’s justification doubting wealth evidence public health recommendations CDC get pandemic control herd immunity. It’s foolish think outsmart collective intelligence experts public health epidemiological communities. yea, good point lol Right conflicting recommendations CDC web site. recent recommendation [Interim Public Health Recommendations Fully Vaccinated include 90-day limit. older recommendation comes [When page, assume updated soon reflect newer recommendations, yet. suggest interpreting recent guidance one CDC actually intends follow right finally move lives indefinitely?

You really putting life hold right early March unenforced CDC recommendation applied even earliest vaccine recipients nearly May always likely updated anyway. Agreed. someone explain J&amp;J 66% efficacy elsewhere 72% US? change formula US? saying, get damn vitamin D. ain’t gonna cure anything you’re gonna lot healthier especially got covied course vitamins people need careful supplementing body can't easily eliminate also things deficient better looking altering diet rather supplementing. 

I want anyone read comment think ""well reason take vitamin d!"" Hey random Reddit stranger.

Just wanted say two months looking likely right.

Happy say I'm 90% likely wrong case :) thing could change variant comes vaccines can't handle would able predict that. Yes been, got vaccine work emergency response. that’s fucking lie say people quarantining gold standard everywhere. society would crumbled. 

Those people absolutely work without vaccine. sad part? Teachers expected work. anyone ineligible able get Covid vaccine excess inventory? heard places call get list. could would nowhere found philly burbs yeah maybe three percent people expect teachers. surprised mine showed time first hour... data use publicly accessible. like sort secret stash. Fundamental institutions continue buddy. mood reopening shifted everyone eager move vaccine arms. Sorry. rationale scares feel free religiously study case counts variants go back lifestyles. western world entirety would ban travel Brazil one month late, strain would already. Bad assumption. lots things could had. unless tested positive it. would connect educated people people sub? 

When people make fun sub, isn’t people repeating accurate information qualified sources. It’s *weren’t* instead took extreme pessimistic position everything. &amp;#x200B;

That, detective, right I'm willing admit epidemiologists way smarter, access better data, do. know job, claim expert germ theory. 
I'm glad got vaccine one year. that's mostly wife works COVID hospital. folks getting info vaccine access likely open 2-3 weeks everyone US? based claim Fauci made week two ago places track think timeline? Since January I'm annoying position know *could* get vaccine *technically* eligible (I teach college person right 1b eligible-ish, licensed psychologist currently practice, 1a eligible-ish) folks know bent definitions get access grinding see returning version normal I'm desperate for. really good reason believe could get vax next month would really helpful ole psyche, hard keep hopes given long light end tunnel distance 😩.  vaccine 100% effective still lot virus there. I'm guessing herd immunity continues build next couple months CDC drop ""as long one risk severe disease"" clause. now, playing safe want keep risk low possible vulnerable. schools open countries teachers risks. again? Jesus Christ

Sorry, lab better data mine? so, please share.

I think person responding one people legitimate concern. someone health problem cannot vaccinated, would take risk? Yes, fewer people wind virus lower viral load. That's ""This again?"". guarantee, no. seems wrong, don’t go doctor find pharmacy go state portal Thanks! Unfortunately chart N/A metrics I'm looking for. Maybe can't find anything. AZ might deliver 20 million doses Q2. disaster. initial contract something like 100+ million doses delivered end March. Sure, case hopefully near future. concern obviously middle ground get there. Today, less 10% US population fully vaccinated, even less exceeded two-week timeline getting last shot recommended CDC.

We’re getting there, we’re yet. actually seems say opposite. say people still transmit virus vaccinated, vaccinated people hanging together people low risk probably better continued isolation. I'm 100% sure Covid, present, I'd place confidence interval around 99.95% so. That's stark contrast faith antibody tests, significantly lower. selling well. want invaded yes no?  Ahhh actually new friends moved Canada 2019. course everyone coming, couldn’t handle 350 million (and wouldn’t realistic), Canadians reporting American licenses vaccines coming quite Americans made way across borders. think need ask Pfizer rather EU, supply blocked EU. Florida's 7 day average 5652 today vs 9500 month ago.

UK's 5995 today, vs 23652 month ago.

So, ""about same"" mean ""less half rate decline"". notably, too, UK variant *increasing* count Florida - UK, despite dominant London far back December, falling. Florida. Fantastic news. virus acquired immunity vaccines pretty clear time lift remaining restrictions epic summer. neither New Zealand. won’t vaccinated til end 2021 3 weeks almost negligible Pfizer supply Uk. expected get deliveries March 1st.

They importing vaccines India. capacity 1.5 million vaccinations day even able hit 500K day due Pfizer available. statement quoting talking today, 2 months now? Good thing article United States, specifically NYC. think already conversation. Charlie Baker still line CDC guidelines CDC wants people wear masks public. no-mask part private homes family/friends, ideally vaccinated. sure, copy CDC's messaging help vaccine adoption. That's fair, I'm really fan whole ""lie public can't handle truth"" approach that's used last year. thing masks beginning.

Better trust people use consistent messaging lie short term gain. give consent lick face don’t frequent CNN man lol. Every time I’ve turned channel ticket Covid cases deaths. Nothing recovered vaccinated said ticker. 

Don’t think it’s bit dramatic say “hatred grown tiresome US” one comment? exact mortality rate was:

Infants: 26 every 1000

7 28 days: 19 every 1000

Under 7 days: 17 every 1000

Post neonatal: 7 every 1000

Fetal: 16 every 1000

Late fetal: 12 every 1000


That much higher 2% considering several statistics individually works 2%. can’t say for? think official, peer-reviewed studies yet, anecdotal evidence seems indicate getting vaccinated significantly reduces chances spreading virus. Yet bet she'd take drugs problem. author article summary charts comparing vaccine studies here: http://hildabastian.net/index.php/107

It's linked article, could prominent. FYI prospective students. Universities mostly person fall include University Wisconsin system (several good options there), Marquette, University Arizona. Feel free add others. giggity countries schools already open guess could indicated product - say example spray twice day morning night news. ad. want TRUTH moron!

So genome good enough? Mortality rates dead-on balls accurate? Talk ""90,000"" cases warrant response level gave?

Yes, given mortality/infection rates published. accurate. got first dose Pfizer Saturday tested positive today. symptoms amplified seeing vaccine covid thing time? feel like US going help Canada first EU. 

But hope guys get quickly too. So, April, green pass necessary anymore everyone vaccinated. Right? noticed too. It’s weird. People fight really hard believe wish true.  article says although things looking still need careful variants. simple reason get much pharmaceutical infrastructure produce way countries. vaccines aren’t shipped US, made US.

That's opinion it. hope hospital workers finally feel little less pressure/stress 12 hours began experiencing chills nausea, vary person person theory Reddit sounds great. Biden completely surpassed states (and cities) went directly private providers covid 19 vaccines, absolutely would legal ramifications states would win. federal government jurisdiction local public health policy. can’t usurp state city authorities easily.

Source: Guess (1 dosed) keep staying home seeing variant plays reopenings.  get first one next week!!!!! There's something karmic this. Okay good, definitely planning seeing family side country I'm vaccinated (they're already vaccinated). Yellowstone Federal land? could wrong, Federal guide lines still enforced? I'd like know many people least partially vaccinated got JNJ vaccine month later catch covid (a mild version per expected), transmit another unvaccinated person would also mild version? could vaccine protect unvaccinated person all? Asking since son young vaccines. There’s reason Fauci job decades Osterholm. True, that's I'm using public forum like reddit Fauci say this? Since nearly complete 180 two weeks ago said mask wearing regardless vaccination status could go quite time, come podium relaying this? Personally, I'd rather him, since he's flip flopped many times, best stays away messaging. ""I'm fine quarantine forever!"" Well us not, expect us 1.7 million far population 37 million. good they're getting Thanks this. also Pfizer vaccine. Praying next shot easier!! Yep basically saw use Splatoon 1 Wii U I'm referring what's happening live. kids. Personally think school high risk nothing wrong close circle family/friends, long you/they minimizing contact strangers. misread thought referring virus general low risk.

To put perspective, 27 cases past 10 days that's biggest outbreak we've had. People turned droves get tested. dominated conversation. We've kept virus bay better almost anywhere result freedoms, people still careful, avoiding unnecessary trips etc. Still mask mandate. one thing Pandemic superior on: cure chance fail/not work worst part, gets much ire credible experts, clearly manipulates maintain follower base. Well consolation found college worst four years life far. wish better job informing people stuff like giving vaccines. know there's lot safety info fit maybe seems extraneous, ""the vaccine contain virus impossible catch spread COVID it"" important information! That’s honestly biggest tragedy this...

Millennials Gen Z give year lives try save generations shat us every opportunity...and continued entire year...and restrictions lifting vaccinated, continue so...

But, course, fault pandemic got hand... Yes, I'm aware urbanized, point remains greater population = points failure = difficult contain. going bring island excuse...

Again, noticing never said absolves actions government! I'm saying can't exclusively chalk ravages virus that, larger population *also* plays significant part *in addition to* government's handling it. 😂 mean things true would helped, time February rolled around real way stop would close borders completely quarantine anyone coming back country weeks government facility (like one cruise ship). one stomach early February (as evidenced outcry Trump banned travel China way late). virus already spread U.S. undetected 100 documented cases.

Like, get it, leadership blew it, citizens too. Even government mostly-responsible side would given us per capita deaths pretty similar EU, New Zealand. single household stipulation combining people two unvaccinated households pass other. needs worldwide thing celebrated together this.

Otherwise risk giving tons anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers (who say vaccinated) free reign continue infecting people public settings currently mask mandates. nice. Glad hear I'm alone experienced symptoms. &amp; Congrats vaccinated. I'm still going safe, feels good knowing added layer protection. Take care. mean believe can't really transmit we're fully vaccinated? noticed kind thing elsewhere. Even Oregon subreddit someonw posted article new Oregon variant bunch people initially downvotes it. also noticed happening subreddit well.

We're leading world among large countries top 5 % population vaccinated... Vaccines don’t prevent 100% COVID cases. They’re effective, still possible vaccinated person get transmit disease - unlikely. someone risk severe disease unvaccinated, unlikely thing might kill them. specific sorry. meant vaccine becomes widely available. yes sadly thing Q anon parts country. live state open since last summer puts things perspective.

Most people refuse vaccine worried microchips host crazy things even here, shortage people thought CDC wanted permanent masks. Link? Yeah, I’ve fully vaccinated month many longer. can’t imagine CDC saying 2 months need completely go back old days worrying needing quarantine again. already know vaccines last much, much longer- guarantee it.

Unfortunate fact is, need proactive. Hopefully us site step reach eligible friends/family/acquaintances. I've become something vaccine hunter everyone know eligible. 

I disagree assessment unfair helping people ""cut"" line. Presumably eligible people get signed up. Isreal, I've never seen anyone say country. think Israel study shows non-transmission vaccinated individuals published, CDC loosen guidelines vaccinated individuals? believe remember past research rare cases, vaccine linked adverse event showed greater 4 weeks inoculation, although cannot find today, admit wrong. isn’t towards specifically, never got comments like state it’s hard get Covid vaccine many people eligible groups sign up. there’s problem convincing enough people get shot least haven’t hit yet.


It's problem *right now* vaccine still supply constrained, think safely assume many people (example: [Between Quarter Third Health Care Workers Refused COVID willing get vaccinated hurt get head start convincing them. Likely months vaccine supply meet/exceed demand convincing people becomes important.  Russia China. whole ""vaccine diplomacy"" thing well.

It's like, comfortable with. need Daddy CDC tell what's okay what's not. Thank God right money messaging here. exactly need right now. 

The knowledge full vaccination license get together others vaccinated behave pandemic never happened get lot shots going arms may otherwise have. 

My first shot tomorrow looking forward license chill. main issue see government pretty explicit tourism resume every Kiwi chance get vaccinated (ie there's enough supply want it). getting done Q3/Q4 summer starts Southern Hemisphere crucial. NZ deserves reap benefits huge spike tourism money come already vaccinated upper crust want escape winters North (and potentially escape whatever upticks cases still around then). hope part COVAX, take expire Pfizer doses would otherwise go waste chip away border, healthcare, essential worker populations getting vaccinated.  Clearly not. still spread others. problem people (especially experts) make reasonable predictions based actual data. problem people though we'd 6,000-10,000 deaths day right going continually get worse worse without reprieve. Basically fear mongers ignore reality, facts, stats, logic want everyone cower corner them.

Back December, made bold ""prediction"" second half January going look much better first half, would large look better every day out. multiple people call idiot say February March literally going blood bathes we'd record deaths entire time.

I explained logic (sheer number previous infections natural immunity, vaccines way, combined ending big social holidays) still called fool. yet spot could possibly been, flaw thought fall cases would less actually was. PLUMMUTED. 

*Even numbers falling* consistently end January, still people arguing saying ""two weeks cases going make trending"" people continued want fear know, people read news neutrally without feeling fear.

I can't agree this, fear mongering headlines get clicks therefor get money. Many people read past headline realize fear mongering attempts that: fabricated (or least exaggerated) fear. Fear sells. Really high day today cases since December. lockdown since well. around 7000 cases two weeks ago day. reality, I'm sure that's supply chain works especially Pfizer's unique handling requirements. think one country handle much Pfizer produce one time like next 90m doses exclusively US. can't store much come June/July NZ gets doses like 100k time that's handle one time. think Hipkins might mean we've received allotment one week used next scheduled delivery afford forego one get another next week. one New Zealand actually miss scenario. health care system small many people qualified administer doses actually limiting factor many doses get once. misinform people? Absolutely not, that's okay. mean originated Wuhan, what’s left dispute? don’t enough room home gym 600 sqft studio apartment. signed vaccine volunteering opportunity waitlist... let's keep rolling likely mean social gatherings vaccinated people non public places. depends entirely state live in. VA vaccinating general public Feb 30, 2022. ""The recommendations also say vaccinated people come together way people considered low-risk severe disease, case vaccinated grandparents visiting healthy children grandchildren.""

This makes nervous. Hubby fully vaccinated (works hospital) I'm not, even though I'm severely immuno-compromised. errands leave house Dr appts. I'm afraid might another excuse anti-maskers. making excuses CDC, please interpret way. un-pin tweet.

Did miss part too? beginning. get you’re saying, it’s CDC’s job lie. matter agenda may be, always honest. Two weeks according recent White House briefing, two. understand reasoning vaccine prevent contracting COVID? 

It helps protect contracting COVID, yes, preliminary findings suggest greatly decreases (if eliminates) ability transmit virus also (if still it). Also, would know someone fully vaccinated without asking?

You won’t. That’s recommendations specifically small gatherings family close friends - would already know vaccinated not. Pakistan heavily relies India many life saving drugs. Politicians keep hush hush fit 'India bad' narrative. would probably benefits.

But let's recognize there're also drawbacks. time acknowledge getting vaccinated = spreading it. got first shot believe phizer one Air Force Saturday. Sunday felt like Covid again. Cough, chills, body ache, head ache, loss appetite, fatigue. Anyone else similar symptoms? Covid April knocked least 3 weeks wasn’t back some
Semblance normal least 3 months really news come to? repeating shit knew month ago? don’t get this, you’re fully vaccinated what’s fear? never point time everyone vaccinated covid, still gonna go out? basically guaranteed get severely sick covid (mild symptoms worst). Follow guidelines still guess don’t get you’re worried. according CDC 2 weeks.  First all, fuck bolsonaro. dude 100% genocide world entire family would rott jail.

Second, gringos suddenly care implications Brazil's mutations affecting country?

When virus control UK, America Italy, tragedy, soon virus control Latin/ non-white country, read affect guys ""first world"".

The UK generated mutations virus made spread easier, US, comotion nowhere near i'm seeing right Brazil suffering dangerous mutation.

The estimation 3 THOUSAND Brazilians going die, every day next couple months.... Nice see guys priorities check. Growing evidence israel says vaccinated individuals difficult time spreading virus. someone explain bit - can’t brain today. 

“vaccinated people safely gather indoors one unvaccinated household without masks physical distancing, long one risk severe disease.”

Why would matter someone risk severe disease? would include risk, fully vaccinated people? Look Lula ensure run (and win). never allow someone great win. Never again. think secret fetish / goal. 

They desperately want say ""see vaccine work, poison rushed!"". Even though caused mutation reduced vaccine efficacy. Right, used link. previous one even worse.

There may long term side effects, I'm arguing that.

However, long term side effects show months years. I've argument bunch people either understand I'm saying, provide examples prove point. comment CDC posting blatant lie. responded lengthy diatribe. agree lie, spend 100 words excusing it? [Fetal infant 60s almost 20%. infant mortality rate U.S. 2020 5.681 deaths per 1000 live births (aka .056%).

Like, year people. 


At point, anti masker-unvaccinated people already exposed. mention, seeing vaccinated people masks isn’t going make wear better. Sure, lie say they’ve gotten shot, make much dent? bad would really unvaccinated stopped wearing masks? rate vaccinations, decline cases/deaths/hospitalizations, warm weather, fact huge percentage people already exposed past year... curve flattened point way ball rolling, can’t see unvaccinated anti maskers would able serious damage. draw line somewhere, obviously cutoff. age. 64.9 pretty inconvenient age right now.

They drew line somewhere pretty sure excluded (i.e. BMI 29.9) safely super high risk zone. knew last, last winter!

&amp;#x200B;

Not really, keep chain going. homeless, living homeless shelter, would required wear one times, excluding bedtime. Try year. Shit, wish could left house kid.

My mom fucking apache helicopter. even go across street skateboard friends. I've seen promising articles people long covid started feeling better getting vaccinated, may hope yet way around - saying cannot reliably say given individual detectable levels antibody given point infection. they’re there, test ought detect them, guarantee previously-infected individual generated continues generate detectable levels antibody. Yeah well ive making sacrifices everyone else whole fucking years.

Time return favor guess. obese (BMI &lt; 40).

Did mean agree. Though must admit state allowing BMI get vaccinated first phase helped out. BMI right around 31 got first dose last week. Started pandemic around BMI 40 lost like 65 lbs since last year around time second tell people getting vaccination means wear mask anymore

It really matter whether tell people not. People going think vaccinated means safe. that's always thought vaccines that's desperately *want* think one. think public health communication matters point--the cdc say whatever wants, people going go back living pre-pandemic get shot think there's force world that's going stop them. They'll ignore guidelines anything serious happens there'll riots. hope unknown truth matter good enough. guys take bit good news shit sub. Antibodies leave body within weeks. This. nuance, backed data missing current US rollout. So, jealousy? thing coveting neighbor something something? said bunch gibberish course deliberate. accidentally deliver vaccine? plausible accident. Kids adults too. continue working finding vaccine this? Specially gonna take vaccine every years antibodies wear out? likely someone reads much doom porn ""other side.""

Read mostly liberal articles? probably way overblown idea COVID's worst case scenario would really look like (not saying awful real life, apocalyptic imagery painted many media outlets excessive). Read mostly Republican articles? probably way overblown idea badly lawmakers want keep mandates place.

From TX CA, think everyone politics wants masks gone eventually. enjoy wearing mine either, first year whole adult life sick once. I'm sticking crowded places mandate no! Hopefully help long covid people Maybe site majority American? Probably something natural backlash occurs we've called ""selfish evil grandma murderers"" past 12 months daring want human contact ingredients EU importing? could model - sucks able see people's faces/smiles
- Harder understand people
- work keep face clean
- Something always remember leave house
- pain headphones
- Sorta dystopian looking Anybody notice allowing masks indoors? people need over-explanation lol That's part stayed yesterday.

The new part fully vaccinated (2+ weeks final vaccine) people visit single unvaccinated household indoors, unmasked without distancing, provided household low-risk severe disease (not older adults, pregnant, certain medical conditions, etc.). means many cases, fully vaccinated grandparents hug unvaccinated grandkids again, etc.

Also, fully vaccinated people meet groups indoors, unmasked, without social distancing.

Also, fully vaccinated people test quarantine exposed anymore.

[Interim Public Health Recommendations Fully Vaccinated People | months, it’s already purchased  Nice cover huh AstraZeneca mess. Whoever running vaccine division fool. nope, dont like cruise ships obvious reasons  typed ""florida"" search bar coronavirus one first threads saw.

I get super entertained dumbasses like making super smug statements know talking ass confirm, whole family since sister young, basically really bad symptoms like four days. time got tested came back negative. Mom tested positive dad never got tested sinces he's basically home since March last year. first detected cases US late January far spreading like wildfire then. would seen effects hospitalizations &amp; deaths.

If travel abroad close contact people &amp; US based, high probability covid. say 'definitely' foolish.  service debt monetary policy. Nothing global influence. university, curiosity? youd rather say, say state region lol  banning activities poison earth immense scale serve real helpful function, actually. horrible child! Look harder! Putting people vaccinated together groups, social distancing, wearing masks, great test efficacy.  That's wondering. Admittedly click article, stat irrelevant unless know % population that's fully vacinated. Remote teaching good person teaching. know. I’m actually listening relative teaching right home, get cameras on. they’re on, teachers students engaged. She’s also found expect work it’s bit draining person teaching. 

I’m aware described second paragraph low income minority attended public schools. still advocate remote teaching safe hybrid teaching everyone vaccinated. Yeah never mind Googled first case reported.. permissive expected - GREAT news get anniversary quarantine!

One question: vaccinated parents fly visit unvaccinated kids &amp; grandkids, breach guidelines presumably plane multiple households unvaccinated people onboard physical distancing impossible? started year 210lbs, 153lbs. went ""obese"" ""overweight"" ""normal."" read enough articles obesity comorbidity covid motivated whip shape. irony dieted way vaccine lost hhaha.

But serious note... think would behooved states listed obesity use conservative BMI definition. said, think likely moot point vaccine supply drastically increasing. 3rd world countries can't get pfizer vaccine till 2023 thanks idiots hate masks. They're frustrating uncomfortable. constant reminder things can't do. fog glasses make face sweaty around nose office.

I still wear it. 12 hours every day work. Every time go outside. Anywhere could see people outside household.

No matter side on, masks help people. help keep businesses open. help keep infections spreading. hill choose die makes sense me. hugging parents high risk even vaccinated? Mazel Tov! Lets see college follows Oh man angst whining we’d see actually restrict air travel like would legendary 1. enough concrete information safely state vaccinated people can't become carriers COVID. details released every day support vaccination offering full immunity (including carrying) 95% rate, yet us completely woods.

2. second tell people getting vaccination means wear mask anymore, overnight run printer labels cardstock right wing conspiracists rush produce many fake COVID-19 Vaccination Record Cards get hands sell $20/piece.

You can't hand license idiots run wild think buzzword. I'm simplifying here, 'equality' saying 'everyone get vaccine'. 'Equity' ensuring everyone access said vaccines, including people Internet access live parts country fewer health facilities. CDC start reporting J&amp;J vaccinations dashboards? I’m annoyed county (Oslo county) given every. single. dose. government given us yet we’re almost DEAD LAST list vaccinated % population Norway. told I’d lucky see vaccine OCTOBER. shouldn’t take entire calendar year vaccinate 5 million people.

Edit: spelling, tequila involved tonight whoops That's true, I'm pointing comment relevant here. say whatever want, facts statistics really support conjecture March December timeline quarantine births aligns perfectly significant change birth rates. true all. Check Yep, said would donate nations. risk *anything* vaccinated infinitely small. narrative wasn’t around Super Bowl itself, gatherings parade saw 0 spike got email college saying fall semester completely normal, including regular campus housing, student services, student life activities. knew would happen, soo good finally hear. Good! restrictions please! [here Jmo, america getting vaccine, number card, specifically you. number national database. 

I told cvs pharmacy got first shot. 

If wrong, please someone correct CDC garbage. agree mother got it. due dog groomer get tons clients vactions. Haha ok bud J&amp;J reporting annoying. know, shots going arms that's matters, nice able see progress we're making think planning based progress. 

I know states reporting doses administered made way CDC report portal yet. flu numbers think it’s unfair loop people concerned validity fail-safes certain protocols negative people. mom emotional wreck, friends live different parts state. There's couple people come store claiming hoax. I'm concerned may break teeth note, ""normal"" site seems super-restrictive. read dozens accounts people qualified turned because:

* doctor's note phone rather printed out
* could get ahold doctor time PCP/insurance able get note
* issues documentation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel site serious cutting nose spite face situation. Pretty much. One things actually take pride country they're completely destroying it. I'm curious history lockdowns U.K., trying get better sense timing relates case counts. 

When exactly U.K. go latest national lockdown? January surge?

What I'm trying parcel Osterholm/Ding crowd explain collapse cases U.K. runs similar timeline U.S. last month so.

In late January seemed B 1.1.7 variant Osterholm keeps hyping harbinger doom U.S. well established dominant variant U.K., expect total chaos there. Yet case curve looks similar here. Now, excuse could ""yeah hard lockdown! Otherwise it'd disaster zone!"", yet lockdown amazingly effective, instituted January peak, see much less surge January lockdown real hero story reason B 1.1.7 variant causing total bloodbath?

In science need follow data, yet breathless anticipation B 1.1.7 taking U.S. think experts would take time study really good case example course nation studying U.K. still say 99.99% student debt induced almost nothing pandemic. “quarantine babies” wouldn’t born least January 2021 earliest. There’s still consequences interest payments debt inflation print debt away back spin studio 3x week since vaccinated. require mask wearing. blows, also try remember hated working home feel better go, regardless mask. Cant wait day ditch it!  Yes. literally higher risk everything. virus already mutated. mutate stronger kill younger people. want coronavirus cases possible minimalize potential mutate rapidly. problem ""stop old people dying coronavirus that's goal"". problem ""we need get many people vaccinated stop spreading coronavirus mutate become worse every one."". way get many people vaccinated possible removing restrictions, especially simple restrictions like wearing mask.  U.S. adult obesity rate stands 42.4 percent... Honestly, I’m ugly I’ve loving ability cover half face go out. wonder many others same. got Pfizer shot today! pharmacist said “I bet you’ll never forget moment” felt amazing. I’m grateful science smart people make world better place. big enough deal took worst pandemic century practically us it, many eager stop wearing good. knew last spring. ever told definition insanity? I’m talking experience line. People freaking fuck out. said line 2 hours long nobody wanted lose place still commotion could possibly imagine lol CDC updated- 1.7 million additional shots administered. 1.1 Million first shots. Still J&amp;J lot people misinformed wanting narrative. people saw talking didn’t know people already vaccinated Same! I'm one weekend overeating away meeting 30 bmi criteria. I'm healthy feel right gaining lbs get vax. Totally agree 40+ bmi another story. Good, baseball honestly perfect activity start testing getting back normal large scale. Yankees allowing believe 8k fans in, now, ballpark fits 40k, outdoors, offer plenty safety contact-less exchanges masks.

I've fully vaccinated two weeks now, way look far safe outdoors Yankee Stadium mask April point time going grocery shopping past 5 months, honestly holds true even non-vaccinated people bad?

Doctors trained 'first harm'. gamble life. they're sure suggest safest approach. pretty common sense. This. feel like statistics tend false positive sense statistics cover people tested positive actually virus haven’t tested positive. insane panic.

Panic? I've never seen anything move slowly response Covid-19. think ""faith dollar"" substitute gold/silver.  This. go cruises suck, afraid life. 2020 doesn’t make sense track. data effects births valid absolute earliest 12/11/2020.

Most quarantine babies starting option work remotely shouldn’t somehow taken away workers didn’t luxury.

Except remote teaching garbage. Everyone knows vast majority kids hate teachers. Tell motivating teacher teach zoom classroom full turned cameras little social interaction? 

That also even begin focus massive achievement gaps highlighted pandemic. High income families send kids private schools back person, kids continuing cultural, social academic development. Kids public schools (who skew towards low income, minorities) left behind thus vulnerable socioeconomic stressors future. literally vaccinated 80 million people three months H1N1 hit, infrastructure know-how current government pure incompetent thrash Lol don’t look Twitter, right wing nuts going crazy Interesting, couple friends (female) elementary teachers early 30's can't wait kids even though always complaining shenanigans students do. underatanding none figures PCR confirmed cases. lists symptoms go by. ran trials later variants

I hear news time. make sense. time trial relevant variant original one like Pfizer Moderna trials. much virus population, clinical trial design math take care that. 

It still stands know JnJ's efficacy way vaccine manufacturers presented - efficacy preventing symptoms all. Amazing happens little competent leadership. indeed good reason EU overdo it. entire world currently depending EU pfizer vaccines, I'd say quite leverage yet. would sharing vaccines fairly world, everyone that, definitely case moment. 

It's sucky situation involved. want deprive country vaccines. also want pharma companies exporting EU facilities whilst time cutting back EU deliveries absurd degree. doubt many people giving birth January October 2020 would've chosen baby virus.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Well assuming *certain* populations don’t spread high degree mutates becomes resistant vaccines. may actually true though. COVID flu. think anybody arguing that. OK argue effects different diseases.

Flu kills young old. COVID almost zero effect young. lopsided flu. also greatest effect specific demographic old.

The scary ""it could anybody"" argument popped COVID brings flu people. Yeah sure might get sick, yeah sure much unlikely might die, true disease?

What matters lot learned high risk, almost old pre-existing conditions.

Fear mongering really really tiny group outside slight chance real issues is, well, fear mongering.

And ""we fully know"" argument best, sort thing. Yeah don't, know shit load point. Keep playing gaps know, watch argument keeps thought gaps instead reality. friend mine pharmacy school said they’ve told people wait least hours post vaccine taking something like aspirin Advil. So, don’t think it’s worrisome It’s concerning yet vitro lab study. started seeing vivo (real world) data people vaccinated getting sick variant suddenly...I’d concerned. stupid. Shots arm. wasted doses trumps getting verification right. BREAKING NEWS: true vaccinations :::Surprised Pikachu::: LA Times lab. Come /r/Covid19 read science. articles exploiting anxiety clicks. Isreal equivalent 180,000 new cases US Friday. 

Tell us Israel destroyed it? work school district. high levels absences December 2019-January 2020. Enough even talking shutting school couple weeks. one assume sick time, think safe say earlier thought. Ever found wondering person still able carry/transmit polio small pox, even though vaccinated? probably feeling covid. Working high risk activity.

Get test week even don’t develop symptoms. It’s it’s negative you’re fine. symptoms test negative wait days test again.

And wear mask! We’re almost finish line here... UK never vaccine manufacturing capacity setup population first. countries setup manufacturing UK vaccines would allowed exported. countries placed orders EU believed EU stated. EU made clear would EU first policy, countries would probably looked elsewhere first.

The EU slow place orders punishing others mistakes. also made clear orders placed EU would follow US nationalising vaccines. mean moment vaccine starts deployment fucked. Could summarize common people concerning study is? understand vaccines 10 times less effective, reduction? news: bear shits woods. can't years occur best years life? I'm 30s consider year least slightly better last year, 2020. Loudest laugh morning - thank you! people require medical attention irrelevant. Oh yeah too. Used people bullshitting think know. friend's wife exposed tested positive 4 days post-exposure, got tested day negative. Went got tested 2 days even though symptoms, tested positive. **Don't assume safe test negative 4 days.** agree 100%, that's current narrative unfortunately. also means points failure.

As people themselves, think way: would easier telling 10 people quarantine six weeks, galactic empire 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 people quarantine? Remember quarantining returning flights *military bases* 2 weeks back February 2020? Absolutely bonkers know really happened. Whay happened texas NYT made think happened. Yeah, I'm restaurant employee I'm thinking I'm going soon. getting emails texts state's health department. Lol stfu stay shit hole country let people die. New Zealand actually values human lives money. matter? people turned fine insignificant. unreported cases means way people antibodies.

That’s good. possible, I'd rather regrets affect rather children, regret it, affect them. I’m pointing countries actual de facto export bans. EU joining list, although still allows Pfizer exports they’re meeting contractual obligations. 

Point seems asymmetrical outrage EU, India, US UK differering extents same.

Anyway, enjoy day, enough time spent 😅 unreported cases means way people antibodies.

That’s good. perhaps EU US? canot blame Brazil getting vaccinates say need open UN vaccinates them. vaccinate vacines US, UK, Europe, etc. Yes working home great white collar workers 40s. It’s also absolutely crushed social lives psychological work-being nearly everyone 30, news outlets blame young people spreading covid us try best balance consideration others living life fulfills basic needs young adults. everything Gen X Boomers, work/school home ubiquitously devastating socially financially gen Z CDC literally reccomends quarantine come contact someone that's already it. know stops transmission probably want make everyone keep wearing mask unvaccinated people lie say already shot. unreported cases means way people antibodies.

That’s good. problem scientist almost speak different language layman many things lost translation.

&amp;#x200B;

Scientists say don’t know reduces transmission, mean isn’t enough empirical data yet confirm it.

Regular people hear “we don’t know” assume it’s 50/50 toss up. laymen speak, already “know” it’s going reduce transmission, isn’t enough data prove yet It’s Pharmac approves meds. Pharmac funding. It’s MedSafe. created backlog, they'll discuss prioritization bringing sprint. I’d read study? mean know read academic journals. doctorate understand statistics let people decide fear might ""branded"" something. easy society branded racist, extremist, anti-vaxxer anything. Give people big ol' middle finger dare take decisions. great insight course hits nail head. hahah. Touche definitely look Brazil less countries. What's happening huge tragedy.

What understand Brazil getting worse, countries seem recovering.

That's unbelievable tragic, also raises question Brazil country getting control.

I would hope vaccinations start making difference Brazil soo well. world eventually work together country continental left behind, would devastating everyone oxygen mask first helping others.""

I agree this. Besides, need us (South Americans), winter. I'm little worried Mexico, well, spring coming anyway. Complaints CNN sure went sharply sub around end Jan.  UK mentioned blocking exports. UK never said exporting never vaccine manufacturing virus everything setup UK UK. point being, UK never setup export, EU manufacturing set basis would exporting. want export population done, countries may looked elsewhere one would conversation.

I hope gets sorted. people get 70% vaccinated: “indoor dining still risky irresponsible” around 55-60 million quarter right? gone up? (for whole EU obv) That's what's discussed. u/CPAlum_1 said 100 million vaccinated, pointed that's case.

Side note, less half 55+ received first vaccination.

The CDC reports [\~41 million first shots gone people US census states [90 million Americans 55 


And look numbers carefully since CDC includes 50-54 count, fewer 41 million doses gone 55+. Probably realm like 38 million so. Somewhere around 40% getting first dose. know bigger countries people around carry task right? Oooo buddy sounds like baseless assumption yeah game odd way... 4000 people world wide survived, lose.

Did though?  knew early lung scarring last year they've people testing vaccines nearly year right, bother seeking information health. agree, also feels like majority posts are: Yo, safe take mask lick everything sight. There's moderate view this. either doom vroom vroom. order around Chinese New Year? I’m Microsoft product getting vaxed.. crazy conspiracy theorists would say 😂🤣 Maybe, know. know easier least try. US even make effort real lockdown. Great news. tragic 500k dead need vaccinate 328 million people bring back normal life think 100% sure data hand, evaluate validity statistical tests used?

This sub cracks sometimes. weird, tribal way think live. least get flu vaccine help protect her. can't COVID. 

Also, ways COVID acts body similar deals with, condition. concerned infection would impact her. know adults condition gotten COVID, result pretty.  must somewhat young. lengths govt gone punish smoking unreal Choosing 30 BMI threshold bit silly. 

\#1. lower end ""obese"" BMI ranges relatively article points BMI poor measure. reference, Arnold ""Conan-the-Barbarian"" Schwarzenegger world's prestigious bodybuilding competition 1974 33 BMI. think stage important cut nose spite face.

May introduce friend, name America. kinda relate covid six months ago really worried safety relates covid since then. want vaccine another +1 statistic encourage return normality. Waiting get jabbed people tell generation mine (millenial) lift bootstraps could die less... healthy person whose family luckily get affected financially weep lost sacrificed much this.


I school aged kids fairly well considering everything actually 4th grader son thriving remote, 1st grader daughter went back person see last year academically shining case, IEP minutes ressource learning tripled mess... least mentally kept well get creative rethink things suffer virus disrupting lives.

A year ago entering last week normal life, whole freaking year... Lol nothing put body ""absolutely safe"". sound like vaccine cultist unconditional belief holiness vaccines. read article? It’s imaging show swollen lymph nodes caused vaccine might accidentally flagged cancer screening. It’s hypochondria. 

It’s saying health care provider need ask people vaccine recently avoid unnecessary worry concern screening expenses. Well America extraordinarily common. simply much better position Europe I’m really worried. I'm sorry, someone completely willingly going something like this, risking futhermore willingly putting others risk contracting dying own, preventable, actions, deserve death themselves. bad thing. People want able provide good life children. want less children high quality life? wonder long people would continue follow government rules. There's probably significant minority would follow rule indefinitely without question. trust State Texas' government either. Also would like see that, thanks coming sooner later Remember takes weeks kick in!

Don't go kissing everyone meet yet :P oregon get test couple months ago, unless symptoms confirmed contact someone positive test result. 
It insane. transmission ability lower bit faster, actual transmission protection quite much lag time. really meant rebuke... likely. type info really studied part speedy trials getting vaccine arms prevent deaths important sped things up.

Someone push glasses like ""ACKUALLY dont know that"". dont know either way sure. know vaccines work. also know toll covid taking people. theres proof spreads vaccinated people, Im going assume cant.

If vaccinated would go hang 91 year old grandma isnt? Fuck no.

If 91 year old grandma vaccinated wasnt, would hang her? Fuck yes. already HIV status thing Grindr, it’s stretch. would make lot sense vaccinating 1-2 million people day. like there's 20 quadrillion people US. really really cheesy advice try get outside can. finally 60 today outside bit felt life affirming! daughter really much risk covid flu? Flu seems deadly within children, Covid likely much dangerous even condition? yeah know never focus negative side life much enjoyable focus optimistic side tried online says can't Yep. would moment. lost ton weight year (thx Covid), ""healthy weight,"" I'm certain body still consists 99% fat, 1% snark. Well UK receiving Pfizer vaccines would block exports lipids?

When start shit like this, everybody loses. countries block raw materials required vaccine production, makes EU's shortfall worse, means countries wait even longer doses expecting.

Punishing EU received supply best strategy. tally vaccine doses Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech PFE.N vaccines 6:00 a.m. ET Monday, agency said.

Still including, least fully, J+J. lot schools opening first time since shut down, I’m hoping absolute best lower grades fairing wrt outbreaks, I’m hoping better job. 

Public schools lower grades properly sanitizing put responsibility teachers schools don’t even provide proper sufficient cleaning supplies. yeah, I’m surprised wouldn’t screw safety protocols they’re hanging onto strand. Bloomberg saying J&amp;J data might come later today opinion variants essentially reflection level optimism/pessimism. evidence variant truly problematic point, always possible (Although unlikely) problematic variant could pop up.

If optimistic, variants issue. pessimistic, they're huge issue. Yeah thinking opposite scenario makes sense shows BMI bad, outdated metric go by. Page 40 contract, there's redacted table delivery schedule. understand... every lockdown worked

The November one short, cases still dropped significantly. 

The problem UK lockdowns started 2/3weeks later have. No, thought that, vaccinated people could go back normal.

What think risk transmission reduced, risk severe disease greatly reduced. point \*single\* household (to minimize risk) unvaccinated low risk severe disease, Grandma's household fully vaccinated, risk Grandma hugging grandkids worth worrying about. Deploy hugs. Get 2 shot vaccine instead. significant reaction second dose, odds never infected before. Yeah heck Blue Jays even doing? Another year Buffalo (even though MiLB coming back year)? difference “believing” “not believing” non-believers haven’t lost spouse, relative friend know someone got sick hell and/or hospitalized. Three former co-workers friend’s wife— dead. Grandson’s wife, two friends, sister mother sickened miserable. I’m believer. statistics grim grief it’s caused real. Sorry that’s inconvenient people. I’m fairly certain neither situations require mask per CDC guidelines. you’re making situation doesn’t even exist. you’re outside running don’t need mask. Everyone clear that. 

But nice straw man. really dig masks huh? whatever tickles bud lay attacks sensible folks explaining why. went end November super recently. drove bypassed stop Florida got onsite except one gas fillup. Disney could expect make things safe still stay open. require masks except sitting actively eating. lines socially distanced. letting certain number people popular stores. felt utmost best, guests seemed playing along. hear crowds gotten little larger spring break, near 100%. point exactly. Twice population California doesnt negotiate Vaccine deals. Comes Feds. Moreover Vaccines Chile come China basically giving away. Well presumably helping 300,000 Italians case.

Well because:

1. 250,000 doses
2. redistributed around EU
3. Italy million unused doses already Envying neighbor’s ass (donkey) never want reminded shit.

It also contractual obligations countries too. EU decided wanted nationalise vaccine production mean companies obey EU. businesses, state-controlled facilities. gain nothing bad press associated missing targets, sure they're capacity meet without breaching contracts. 

VdL trying pass blame failures. get caught narrative. absolutely correct

Like remember SARS could big issue proper quarantine never became much talking point outside NYC Good enough, happens worldwide, make COVID less big deal flu. mutates far slower, vaccines greater efficacy longer. Boosters easier design. I'd bet 10 years flu vaccination rates go back ""normal"", we'll routinely far fewer COVID flu deaths. Let go grab decades real world outcomes mRNA vaccines. Oh wait don’t that.

You young confident everything working best. reality crap happens medical community drug makers gotten very, wrong. wanted know, sure ask not. Personally know least 10 couples put kid vaccinated Trying living Florida May mask beach going run. report back. much doubt Hearing loss extremely this. Makes random interactions public difficult times. severely obese severely unhealthy.

Well terms COVID, unless obese old. Age always biggest factor. Somebody 40 underlying conditions chance death less 0.1% afaik. 

Somebody 61% greater chance death takes 0.166%. individual level, that's tiny increase barely worth mentioning. thought could still spread it, get it? bother. Every one posts sub variant denial bad things been. I'm wondering. Everyone going tell ""Kids low risk"", still want kid get it. There's many unknowns. kid almost 2 would devastated got sick late game ended breathing issues condition. know small children affected it, immune. worth remembering New Zealand real shut sown like 6 weeks normal better part year. leadership. except except except kept festering get full year crap economy half million dead. choice. people downvote this? 

This EXACTLY happening: normal strand going ""lockdowns"" (they real lockdowns, would still go work, groceries, could meet one person indoors, etc.).

But B.117 variant taken rising even throughout ""lockdown"". would make sense IMO! 
In US states list Obesity qualifying medical condition, BMI quoted 30 hence whole rant.

According metrics US states going by, Arnold friggin' Schwarzenegger would qualify Covid vaccine 1974 Mr. Olympia mean, phase 3 studies ""real world"". 

You could argue know vaccinated would prevent transmission, that's always pretty weak angle. soon found vaccines effective think full campaign incentivize people take them. terrible take advice people who've studied field point expertise. Best leave people get information Facebook pages. Next time ill, definitely let us vote treatment instead asking doctor, majority uninformed people knows expert, right? Hospitals collapse again. already 60% vaccination people 60. Hi! went, ask specific paperwork? I'm gonna drive 3 hours want mess forget something! Whatever day mid-March seared mind like 9/11 2008 economic crisis unfolded. wild time lived through. world stopped. Yea see whole issue numbers tracked. Social services monetary actually ability take care older population relies younger aged society, immigrant particular age group robots. UK, people [BMI classed ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" qualify vaccine right now. Hi! arrived, ask specific paperwork? I'm gonna drive 3 hours want mess forget something! Bit late ordering surely enough time. vaccines previously infected close 50% end month. Yes ppl get sick filling hospitals. Still, they've something like 86 deaths TOTAL Covid probably let's go strategy seem know lot symptoms since confirmed virus causes, never fever, cough trouble breathing. eyes itched weeped 2 months. become ever moving goal post. First it’s wait vulnerable populations vaccinated. it’s majority adults. it’s every adult wants is. start on, well, children aren’t vaccinated. 

I think people generally ok waiting a, smaller subset b, rest, much. really start look like control controls sake, especially start get real world data impact vaccine transmission. 

I agree life start look much closer normal end April. assume 1.3m first doses (pfizer/modera only) rest month, would put us ~91 million first doses. Toss another 15 million J&amp;J (75% 20 million said theyd deliverer, delays administrating it, etc wont 20 million perfectly). puts us 106m first doses done. 

I also expect us still increase 1.3 million pfizer/moderna day. think could get 1.4 1.5 end March. 110m 115m first dose shots done end March question, depending much daily rate increases many J&amp;J end getting out. thinking say vaccinated need quarantine Anyone think eventually start conflict sort? like warning days WW1 2 yet hear single viable reason overcomes protecting others. Instead it’s “oh well don’t like can’t see smiles”. 

Well don’t like people killing others they’re selfish wear mask 10 minutes Kroger.

What's medium sized gathering? dunning kruger effect, ad hominem, socialism, social media buzzwords phrases wanna throw around pretend know? Yeah, agree done better.

This article comparing year previous one. yeah, lockdown due coronavirus biggest factor. He's already got immunity he's shots also immunity aswell since first shot already offers thr protection. I'd say fine long enough go childfree never want go back. 

Isn't default mode? ""go childfree"", start childfree. hit 90%, yes, can’t let gas. That’s exactly point. can’t think ”we’re vaccinating 2 million people day, we’re good” 330 million people country. That’s 165 days, realistically 150-155 get heard immunity status, 45 days (jab one, jab two, 2 week incubate) waiting “set”. enough people vaccinated lift restrictions yet, listen medical experts change, say early ease restrictions. would also fit IFR ~0.5%.

~100 million infections 500k deaths. Might unlikely Sunday 42k Monday usually smidge higher unless it’s holiday. Another &lt;50k day likely though. Seems like good policy. India excellent vaccine manufacturing capability. redbubble.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Yeah, we're near 100 million people vaccinated like said before. That's point bringing up. Problem is, optics thing, would rather wait declare ""no mask"" world enough vaccine everyone wants one get one. people stop wearing masks public (and enforced anymore), unvaccinated people anti-maskers use opportunity wear one, places like NYC subway stores, etc., still necessary. There's ton us access vaccine yet, tourists starting come back. presume they're also coming places turning noses covid.

If vaccines only, could also succeed. without lockdown, evolutionary pressure drive virus toward resistance existing vaccines. risk virus developing vaccine resistance goes numbers infected people.

That's exactly distinction I'm drawing. lawful ones ones endorsed society. always criminals attain high rank commit crimes, like North Nixon.

People would rather safe sorry misinformation makes sense. Although ton people act like it, us aren’t qualified know hell we’re talking about. People need wait till hit herd immunity vaccines + recoveries. But, seems like much ask.

Yup. We're going good track right now, past year shown anything happen nothing guaranteed. could break vaccine targets decimate variant spread keep precautions continue rollout.

* funded supported distribution daily vaccination rate doubled.
* purchased J&amp;J vaccine rates accelerate even further.

Trump bought insufficient number doses daily vaccination rate already starting drop first weeks Biden's term. also lied many hand, since probably want spend money. Yeah live strict state, NJ, expect lot places going continue mask requirements convince cautious people they’re safe.  done afaik, half dose boosters longer intervals. Medicine lags science. Yeah shit. Recovery one thing, imagine becoming covid long hauler. 

Was talking coworker got covid want stop going gym. he's stuck fatigue shortness breath every 5 minutes probably able hop treadmill sometime. Like dude? take damn risk. worth it? exactly number expected. knew we'd hit roughly 50% start summer. ""Fully vaccinated"" means two weeks past second dose.

Says who? Many countries Europe waiting 2-3 months second shot AZ now, example, vaccine becomes effective long second shot. Overall role second shot supposed long-term booster given immunity established. reason waiting extra two weeks made significant difference, would quite surprising. fairness, becaue vaccines pumped like hotcakes major producers like UK US get fully vaccinated, vaccines going everywhere. call namaste Karen they’ll know, people read news neutrally without feeling fear.

The immunology PhDs done nothing make accurate predictions last year bring vaccines end thing, reason throw tantrum tell may fourth surge since less 10% US fully vaccinated UK variant makes 50% cases nation modeled take off. Fewer deaths time elderly vaccinated.

But again, that’s information use advantage. read feel fear, that’s you. Good luck! welcomed new baby December. small rural hospital, Covid restrictions weren’t burdensome. 

Visitors limited kids didn’t get meet sister (apart window) came home. husband father, limited leaving re-entering 1x per 24-hour period. previous kids I’d always gone takeout coffee wife, time pretty much locked hospital food. 

At first kind bridled restrictions even able get grab coffee “family refreshment” station. OB mentioned he’d delivered 10 Covid-positive moms last month, realized dads unit Covid positive, absolutely didn’t want walking around.

7/10, ideal, huge deal either. Idk I've surprised lot policies rhetoric course thing nothing really question. never know next thing justification be. person getting vaccine plus. least location, 75% vulnerable (65+) vaccinated. someone offered vaccine, would feel guilty. That's good hear that. buy incase supply problems, shipments get destroyed, migrant crisis, various things. extra doses, also help poor countries around valuable tourism. makes sense get extra. Literally every country buying extra. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

 I'm guessing Trump administration lot well vaccination numbers been. Thank you!!! I’ve called anti-masker science denier pointing mask mandates put forth government make little difference it’s extremely frustrating. article say anything effectiveness preventing serious illness, least directly. 3% seriously ill people Israel two vaccine doses, sure, that's two equally sized groups. might able justify schools restrictions longer logic they’re gonna convince thousands adults mask/distance another year protect people’s children.

If parents concerned kid’s safety, need take action. They're two different generations different cultures ways ""reproductive freedom"" too. women babies 1940s 50s boomers, women babies late 60s beyond boomers. boomers raised unprecedented luxury security pampering. word, spoiled.

Plus huge country I'll continue wear obe, even make others around comfortable look like I'm asshole. Happy? Lol scomos marketing finesse worked charm 😌 I’ll take whatever they’ll give I’ll like it. hear israel almost entire population vaccinated

How life there? pre pandemic normal covid cases? means...nothing useful. number way big cases, way small vaccinations. countries have, think Canada bought vaccines per citizen country priority list vaccine company . True. New Zealander like winning lottery ticket. love hate Trump too, vaccinations rolling whether Biden lost. may argue roll gone smoother Biden, would get point vaccination one way other. Let's move leave sorts comments past. Okay. gonna get what's cheetoface. Even NZ Oz know open up. tourist industry collapse can't keep feeding money have. anything reference article wise, believe 3 percent death. could easily wrong Capital capital couldve specified yes mean.. *eventually*, early failure pretty goddamn massive impact. getting everyone vaccinated even 70% instead 95% turn Coronavirus moderate cold. seem understand numbers. AZ extremely effective preventing serious symptons perfect preventing deaths. really effective Pfizer. worse in--- really, worse much worse--- preventing mild symptoms. 60-80%, that's easily enough stop virus tracks enough people get vaccine. \*easily\*. flu vaccines tend 50% less. mean people actually risk dying? Get fucking grip lol wont get dose late summer least rate dont want 60something year old parents fucking die see reward volunteering. opportunity anyone get vaccinated right good. There's thing line every person getting jabbed one less human playground COVID play around Idk man, extreme views really believe non-significant niche group people have.  Da, comrade UK waiting 5 weeks schools open next step removing lockdown. takes 5-weeks increase cases become hospitalizations. Zero side effects mean vaccine good. Getting bit fever sore muscles good sign body actually producing antibodies. Yeah. wouldn’t exactly blame them. virus might long term affects don’t know about. might not.

I'd like go! Time open UK incredibly strict definition COVID death, includes many deaths probably classed COVID deaths countries.

Florida hand caught least one occasion trying cover true death count downplay failures. numbers simply trustworthy enough base comparison on. Got first Pfizer jab today. heard side effects family friends first jab second. feeling fantastic, necessarily awful. bleh arm hard rock. Anyone else issue? wife donated blood recently, antibodies present. luxury working home, not. Evidently probably covid point passed her.

We're early 40s, thankfully symptoms virtually nonexistent. daily average vaccinations million day Biden took office. vaccine funding getting average done Trump administration operation warp speed.

Biden magic vaccine distribution, works year plus. What? *believed* prevents vaccinated people infecting others. 



But it’s *proven* conclusive evidence. need historical data evidence. 



Hence original comment company able start production July produce 10 million doses year end

Seems extremely low no? “Hey stop hyperbole listen hyperbole!” sort gage J&amp;J - Florida started reporting March 4 March 8 administered 12,875 doses

Anecdotally I've heard FEMA sites offer Pfizer J&amp;J let folks pick. end day J&amp;J left. got vaccinated Friday, sister got go ahead today. It’s surprising honestly I’m happy city actually progressing imagined large waitlist. Oh lord sounds problematic lol. London unlimited free beer sounds amazing right now, I’d fly coach without bitching! That’s great news!!!! confirmation this? true haha! :) I'm excited go stores honestly! I've gotten curbside groceries whole year now. beer belly, he's fat.

At 5'8, 165 border normal weight. I'm 6'2 much weight despite lifting. fucking wonder shit killing people. god. Remember Alamonavirus? current theory human population plummeted around 2,000 people, may stayed range millennia large population spike late Stone Age. don’t get us, we’ll come back worse roaches. No, vaccination plan passes phases. already EXTREMELY easy skip line creating reason jump line vulnerable populations get catastrophic roll-out. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, important note full agreement 100% get rid mask mandates start giving life back vaccinated day demand vaccine drops phases rolled adults. I'm glad NY mass sites. county sites small pharmacy drives, NY check state website, see appointments, move day.

In PA, state scheduling system, need check grocery webiste, check 3 chain pharmacy sites, bunch independent pharmacy sites, 2 health system sites, check county site... Marburg started manufacturing February: [Update vaccine production BioNTech’s manufacturing site takes months reach full production capacity.

Producing vaccine needs 60 days. First batch find way arms mid April. updated comment link this, CDC seems going 2 weeks J&amp;J shot considered fully vaccinated. think J&amp;J also measured 28 days phase 3 trial also seems evidence immunity continues grow time, might confusion coming from. Canada even given million yet? joke Lets hope current pace holds! 

Better cast net wider let even single dose expire! bit similar Austin well, drive bit easily get appointment smaller county, specially pharmacy. However see improvement, lately lot people able get doses easier, pharmacies helping lot doses allocated, agree state reevaluate allocation, places extra doses less demand, redirect extra dose larger cities running doses fast. Thank you! heard covid, first shot worse, covid second shot worse. So, least (kind of?) know catch covid whole time! :) I'm New York live Manhattan. work way. Also means I'm constantly around people, mention people interact work regularly coworkers. can't get car bubble commute. CDC estimates 1 4.6 cases Covid reported US. would 130 million people already coupled 90+ million vaccines administered. 

The time UK cannot ban product it’s manufacturing.

Coda, fact UK based, bought US company supplying Pfizer US. None actually manufactured UK.

In EU Pfizer supplied German company. Yeah aren’t main two shot vaccines like 90-94 percent effective?

It makes sense people still get it. tell effective get it. course does!

That's Sinovac 80% everywhere else Brazil, 49%. prevent deaths? No. 
Does prevent hospitalizations? No. work? Yes. Hepatitis?   Gamer Floridian - seem misallocating doses across state places like Jacksonville Miami WAY doses demand places Southwest Florida (Sarasota, Ft Myers, etc.) falling behind. 60% folks 65+ vaccinated statewide 40% SW been.

This crazy talk. take click second link papers cite papers shared. click it, find clearly support efficacy face masks. example, paper #1 list, published Nature.

The politifact article also mentioned paper, lead author paper shared, published looks like ax grind masks want hear anything disagrees though.... You’re probably anti masker gets mad people tell wear one starts recording aren’t you? No. Lying making statements intent deceive, ex: kid thinks storks bring babies lying you, parents told were.

Again, lack clarity lie. Italy pretty close numbers comparison States worse did. May Rest Peace vaccine trash criminal offense

Sure. shred evidence happening?

Also fits criteria? Would son Mexican immigrant works hotel list? come state telling June July get shot? really want right. don’t like all, I’m operating hopes dreams anymore. I’m Florida btw, (hopefully) prove wrong. March 15th lowering age 60. Dr. Eric Feigl-Doom posted Tweet 4 hours remarking CDC guidance. That's shock, lol. parents must proud True! Plus hold breath tie shoes. heard rich people podcast covid would June. still know vaccinated people spread it.

Yes do. 100% certain vaccinated people spread it. know 100% certain vaccinated people symptomatic cases. That's 5% say vaccine 95% effective. catch get sick it, spread it.

What we're uncertain precise reduction risk spreading it. Preliminary data suggests something like 75% greater reduction risk spreading covid. Sweden different several reasons Germany super high compared similar sized/political countries. 5 pointer  Shut fear mongering. It’s going happen matter much wish would.

Still think making progress? Fine now, point vaccines available anyone -- like two months -- cant worry people lying. Soon enough population worry isn’t vaccinated. transmission low enough like epidemiologists know much novel virus vaccine approved less 3 months. People Austin sub too! Thats crazy. Something going on... good idea get vitamin levels checked (And full bloodwork depending age) supplement vitamin low regardless affect severity COVID illness.  Yeah?

If not, opinion matter irrelevant. think even would agree need worried. single export Pfizer Moderna ever stopped. exceeding delivery goals deliveries get better better! Again, actual thing? I’ve never met anybody real life said won’t take vaccine assumed wouldn’t help regain normalcy. 

Yeah, thing sub far tell. People like griping US government. think speaking views good faith, views far removed reality. sign times. can't even agree basic facts anymore, course miscommunications like that. Antibody test reliable. I'm almost certain January well. 100 years ago 6 year olds worked factories, so... happy get Pfizer vaccine would taken available. work public school system already kids campuses coming soon. I've saying. real reason people would lie they've vaccinated questioning schools open successfully seen fear mongering. 

I remember crowded HS attended, barely space breathe. really happy they’re splitting y’all rather saying screw safety protocols. It’s probably different based geography know several people probably gonna get they’re microchip types. say don’t know what’s essentially, fair rather unprecedented vaccine. vehemently disagree, defending standpoint—but think unfortunately it’s less extreme David Dees types usually get. clearly there’s shortage people eagerly awaiting jab near future stg imma (consensually course) lick someone’s face year Reddit claims domestic tourism propping rest along government money. would (fully vaccinated) able visit friend who’s also fully vaccinated able safely hangout dad live isnt vaccinated yet? sounds hot, single? Ohio State numbers reported Columbus Public Health, though. They're included statewide numbers. longer invited parties allowed workplace, get vaccinated. Yes, Moderna example, 1% people placebo group reported serious arm pain (grade 3 reaction). vaccine group reported 10%. 

Here's J&amp;J's briefing document, side effects table page 39: see page see page 32: What's consensus spreading vaccinated? live 60 year old guy I'm fully vaccinated... still spread? seen ANYONE talking keeping around indefinitely. like approach Ohio's governor used specified specific metric point mask mandate would lifted. 

I agree point mask mandate MUST lifted. question right KPI use identify point. know people uncomfortable visiting outdoors masks/distancing. vaccinated yet, imagine first vaccine, would move comfort level ""visitations waving window."" It’s mostly people Facebook groups make big deal statements like “masks around fall” able around vaccinated family friends without fear. 

There lot made transmission vaccinated people impatient need answers science time could perform even vaccine available them. thanks input mike Fundamentally untrue. Republicans vote Democratic bills good country too.

Not everyone agrees good, however. probably favor another $25 trillion Covid bills year meant getting government checks. That's probably actually 'good America' though. problematic way vaccine distributed globally way us initially handled vaccine distribution, tried completely locally. believe germany almost badly relying entirely states distribute it.

My guy, specifically said mask MANDATES. MANDATES. strawmanning argument. masks ineffective wear one- OFCOURSE! Pretty sketchy counter-argue actual point..


I'm saying mandate ineffective, masks effective (as seems case), still keep MANDATE. think mandate allows businesses enforce mask rules better, also sending message people pandemic over.

**It's possible currently fewer cases low point last summer** Dominoes falling around world. high level privilege wear mask 10 minutes Kroger that’s it. wear one 40-60 hours week, mandated wear one outside walk dog alone go jog work out. So, comfortably working home using home gym, probably ever wear mask Kroger. many, many people don’t option work home work home.  I’m freshman college, class 2020. Lost mostly second half senior year, prom, graduation plus freshman year college since it’s online. sincerely hope class, especially class 2021, go this. vaccines rollout hope 2021 gets prom graduation every class that’s currently affected, especially high school college seniors. Young people aren’t high enough risk justify losing everything we’ve lost throughout pandemic. mental health crisis pandemic gonna awful CANT THINGS GO BACK NORMAL THEN. FFS! Congrats weight loss! That's really impressive even years worth work. expected.

Variant's lvl treath blown proportion media.

As always.  I’m also wondering that, it’s strange. thought initially needed days update tracker account one-dose vaccine versus two-dose vaccines it’s week presumably already working doses shipped. I'm confused statement. think reliable detecting antibodies think antibodies means COVID-19? That's entire point! think means then??

If simply saying there's chance get negative test result really antibodies, think completely misinterpreted u/the_real_ak meant said reliable.

But guess pack call day *you've* read academic literature them, right? good question. answer twofold. 

First, public spaces always mix vaccinated unvaccinated individuals. Although vaccines greatly reduce risk severe covid outcomes, completely eliminate them. Thus, still possible contract covid unvaccinated person. Particularly early days since year sure long vaccine immunity lasts etc. course always issue variants.

Second, still possible vaccinated person transmit covid unvaccinated person and/or high risk person. Early studies showing likelihood reduced still really early.

Basically, vaccines great still things know enough time passed yet. still better bit cautious know more. Lmao ban buying sausages bought butcher's entire stock short-term supply. simply sausages sell anybody else. long vaccine avoid painkillers? found taking vaccine. 

Unfortunately, took sudafed (w acetaminophen) last night bed allergies, wife took tylenol like hour ago slightly sore throat. 

We're supposed get J&amp;J vaccine 24 hours now... 1,738,102 New Doses administred without including J&amp;J good mean there’s enough give every single Canadian first dose end June Pfizer, Moderna, side AZ contracts. Mix AZ main contract, J&amp;J, Novavax we’re looking enough give 70% Canadians 2 doses end June.

Administration goes provinces, it’s gonna take couple weeks get things going. 5.1M doses coming next 3 weeks, that’s enough give average 243k doses per day. Let’s see hit it. so, 20% Canadians one dose end March. guy got vax didn’t exist year ago news told to. really think took consideration? People say reddit time, general public, BMI decent measure. There's reason overhauled medicine. 

In several years clinical experience I've seen maybe handful people actually obese BMI lifting weights. have, otoh, seen tons guys 25%+ body fat hypertension pre-diabetes, justify obesity muscle mass. I've seen guys obese muscle mass steroid cycles actually lean/""healthy,"" often health problems steroids. 99% patients, BMI works fine. Denmark 10% targeted group first support this.

Less central control. liberty. eficiency  try remember I'm sitting still, I'm moving forward line. like amusement park. Every day another 2.5 - 3 million get ride ride, move another 2.5 - 3 million places line. importing Lipids UK.

source? wear one 60 hours week, almost year now? wonder CDC waiting see Florida numbers went issuing guidance. Florida days away B117 dominant variant, pretty much numbers still decreasing. Even Topol encouraged Florida Yeah called TOFI: Bruh, California you’re supposed wear mask beach going run. mandate mask times, regardless ability social distance. 3 weeks getting first dose person effectively vaccinated. second dose keeping protection longer term help variants. agree. pisses off. also instills doubt everything say. remember tony “the expert” fauci said year ago public didn’t didn’t need face masks virus spreading? Pepperidge farm remembers. “Experts” say whatever highest bidder tells to. I'm confused. Can't asymptomatically spread covid? full year college online havent seen friends since last March. supposed best years life Im excited. vaccine numbers going cases continue go down. pegged late May chance get vaccine months ago Im thinking April, maybe even early April. 

Im boat last line.

It sucks social end really view closer people thinking. think layman's take suggest fully vaccinated people congregate freely without worry. need ""science"" weigh that.. already did. vaccine. Again, I'm saying whether response second shot severe response first. would indicate previously exposed. I'm saying anything else. don’t like smelling roast beef horseradish breath lunch. Brit surprised many Americans wearing masks outside. Yet end spectrum people aren’t indoor enclosed spaces. like two extremes

Heres like 95% compliant indoors, get tiny single figure percentage people wearing walking about. Yup. make better know multiple boomers who've refused vaccine. Exactly. I’m excited shot 2 reasons listed. yeah short term I’m probably already good go. swollen lymph nodes tell I’ve producing lots antibodies haha I'm never getting it. love baseless assumptions. yet one shown me. argue point it’s job provide sources. sorry haha think typed original comment half asleep Five (genetically related) individuals, actually -slightly better......very, *very* slightly.

Nonetheless, apparently taking issue person’s comment makes sheltered east coast commieist whose diet consists wholly regurgitated liberal media. l-o-fucking-l Yes, teachers family spoken this. 

I found [article quick google search, you’re looking information try searching, “coronavirus outbreak nyc elementary school”. coronavirus pandemic laid bare abdication parental responsibility well-being kids. Parents absolutely need community support successful raising kids, many parents push entire parental responsibility onto organizations.

You end kids unable function survive world **organized football**. clear child parents out-sourced responsibilities coaches, teachers, peers. support systems gone, child cope. Moreover, unable help child. Parenting work cannot cut corners.

There parents got creative year. podded kids. found ways safely vacation. built new habits new family rituals. parents damn good job **it's going show developmentally** coming years.

The coronavirus pandemic stripped away excuses. Good parents made work kids nominal better it. Bad parents hindered kids' development, yet blame everyone except themselves. haven’t sick before? usually lymph nodes enlarge body fighting illness—A.K.A. strain COVID-19 get take vaccine. isn’t bad thing know what’s causing it. also, people large ones begin with, swelling noticeable.  SF proper brother works construction last week eligible went mass clinic. Marin mobile units nurses going restaurants giving vaccinations there. Educators though Bay Area know least one dose. know Starbucks workers well. Tbh long hospitalizations continue drop population getting hospitalized gets vaccinated really care much cases going I'm replying response idea fully vaccinated people need government's OK congregate together.

If unsafe congregate privately vaccinated people, then? nothing else do. Covid already heavily controlled countries infrastructure (USA, Canada, many parts Europe, East Asia) getting vaccines conflict ridden nations like Africa Middle East difficult. time vaccinate people terrorist attacks crime rampant places? 9 million doses supposed come US stock. Nobody knows already happened... I’ve heard read, de facto export bans locked contracts. Yea, realistically protected day get second shot, second shot really helps longer term protection also probably protection variants. 

But probably want give anyone ideas skipping second dose. worth think masks great really bother all. Vaccines way better going help us get back normal soon amazing. 

There absolutely data support make effort find it. Average incubation 5-7 days. would wait full week getting test. negative then, probably good. hyperbolic make point. point is, data linked study CLEARLY points out, 30BMI slightly increase **Covid risk**, pales comparison &lt;40BMI. vaccination priority set accordingly, good look speedos.

As stands, telling guy 29.99999999 BMI: ""aaah fine, wait turn"", guy .00000001 higher BMI telling ""ZOMG, get line grandma, going die!!!"" Fuck CNN CDC seems speaking sides mouth today. cannot understand convoluted guidelines masks vaccinated individuals given rates mutation seen year.

I always thought ounce prevention worth pound cure. it'll interesting see states dropped mask mandates wind reinstating guidelines cases start doubling tripling month now. Hopefully next month 80%+ seniors gotten shot(s) see sky-high ICU utilization subsequent deaths.   still carriers, right? Yes literally coincidence. mean not, liar, even made fanfic real, yes would coincidence. Money buy shots. sure thing. dad antibodies test (negative) reaction first second dose. sister (healthcare worker) problems either despite antibody test negative. want anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers walk around saying need wear mask vaccinated. Man, desire ever visit Texas pandemic astronomically low. know way round vaccines! California open retail construction? literally go inspect occupied Section 8 units job eligible yet. Plumbers, bank tellers, transit workers, retail workers, construction workers, hairdressers, assembly line workers, repairmen, entertainment workers. person jobs none eligible yet. 

It’s really open season. 1. person specifically said parents “almost” fully vaccinated, genius. you’re going condescending asshole, least try right. isn’t person refusing see fully vaccinated parents, parents still vaccinated.

2. shame cautious listening experts.

3. rude condescending. dislike even someone right. Even arrogant idiot completely wrong still tries act smug. Wish could get mine. Probably another couple months though :( UK allow exports. assuming doses given. counts far appear Pfizer Moderna know people getting J &amp;J close week now. exciting today could huge drop numbers. spring training field Dunedin, Florida. Answer: want. that, located? get cool flair? Lol Essential workers shouldn’t work without vaccinated without correct safety precautions either. exactly sure you’re debating. Yea, else journalists get clicks instill fear? 100 percent agree. main concern effective preventing long COVID. I'm one kooks things long COVID could turn pretty large public health problem. enough warrant slowing prevention death slightly lower efficacy vaccines, enough warrant study point process. misinform people? Absolutely not, that's okay. 

Did miss part?  sure wearing N95 mask mass transit cold flu season next year, hope there's acceptance people ""distancing"" feeling sick form calling work canceling plans feel better. Unlikely. even you’re transmitting vaccinated people. you’re around vaccinated people you’re wearing mask practicing social distancing. Remember keep basics mind just....relax. People call others selfish whiney want normalcy back year hold

They calling people selfish, literally cheering new variants disease, always trying paint everything positive negative light.

It's sickeningly small vocal majority here. like issue intellectual property theft letting people die poor countries can't afford fund vaccine development Sure, that’s absolutely positive. people lie vaccinated order allowed things?

Do think people vaccinated (especially ones hesitant get vaccinated) continue wear masks social distancing public recommended CDC? - effect think could nonvaccinated people start seeing people without? That’s I’m addressing. understand reasoning vaccine prevent contracting COVID? Also, would know someone fully vaccinated without asking? idea people downvoting you. upvote. government lying citizens something like terrible idea. winning fight, government reporting such. I'm means anti masker person anything man reads like someone suffering Stockholm syndrome. not. think making claim long term side effects “do exist” using random redditor claims immunologist source, argument “google half life mRNA” it’s obviously possible something short half-life damage shows much later - great argument.

Real arguments would probably in-depth people want read, though. It’s like cellular biology simple lol.

Edit: false statements well. go look research you, vaccines caused problems months. several weeks. comment linked “the last time US problem vaccine 60s” isn’t true either. don’t worry find sources today get chance. Missouri's governor said could concerts far back last...whenever hell lifted less-than-30-day stay home orders (April??). Luckily cities containing venues smarter that. state in? sound right all. states done vaccinating 65+ end March. statement important really gonna drive people get vaccinated now.

This isn’t towards specifically, never got comments like state it’s hard get Covid vaccine many people eligible groups sign up. there’s problem convincing enough people get shot least haven’t hit many people know get vaccine this. thought would never allowed back normal.

Again, actual thing? I’ve never met anybody real life said won’t take vaccine assumed wouldn’t help regain normalcy. Sure, I’ve heard people say “don’t trust it, it’s new/rushed”. helpless sentiment “what’s point getting vaccine?” something I’ve seen Reddit, specifically subreddit. long getting J&amp;J shot take protected? parents got I'm wondering deal is. I've heard two four weeks said CDC guidelines surprisingly top. Remember CDC says dont go outside sun ever without sunscreen. normally super strict shit? said responding comment. 

I need telling post can't. Speaking horses, get high one go lecture someone else? time messaging shifts this! vaccine ought seen ticket back full normal life.  think know people fair amount “non permitted” activities think good Since they’re finally acknowledging getting vaccinated = back normal. Yeah understand, still good know 1st dose rate continue per others fully protected. chart shows this? I'm looking for. Totally, also consider every person comes contact people could high risk turns that's people....and brings us back prioritizing vaccinating high risk people first. begun people highest risk medical issues state. God wish kiwi CDC 4.6x higher month two ago. would put us little 130m cases .4% IFR. Ohhh ok 100% get desire reopen business. get people choose mask debate proverbial hill die on\*. really see Masks much imposition all. Heck, whole adult life I've sick winter. year I've sick once. 

I one continue wearing masks crowded public places (especially winter) planes airports. 

That said, open indoor dining, suppose restaurant context masks probably make less difference Patrons (not talking staff) since patrons unmasked 50% visit anyway due eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Yes, get nuance mandates applied force vs left individual. post daily thread per day, that's it. seeing elsewhere, that's me, I'm sorry.

Do better link? I'd love update it. voluntary basis, masking makes sense crowded indoor areas flu season. year's flu season practically non-existent. would nice continue trend. Wow, lot words. truth *not* seeing death sickness 1 year would entire career - blatantly false actually quite silly even suggest it. also ones tired 12 hour shift. finally, (rightfully) first line get vaccinated, no, worry bringing virus home them. comment questions motives anonymous source downvoted groupthink eventually deleted Mods. Upvoted comments thread called regime change Russia... :| pretty damning indictment subreddit narratives allowed perpetuate.  understand reasoning vaccine prevent contracting COVID? Also, would know someone fully vaccinated without asking? Wait, can't still transmit virus? something guidelines knowing how, exactly, vaccines change spread covid19. CDC can’t recommend dropping health measures public “until know more”... studies set conclude March April, hopefully guidance change studies produce data. understand wanting surround tons unvaccinated people right now, certain point (likely within next 4-6 weeks) people going come terms fact there's zero risk scenarios low-risk likely good enough Ehh, directly, entity sued point voluntary compliance recommendations ""prove"" negligent. lawsuit-averse business follow them. verdict whether vaccinated individual (Pfizer) contagious? family abroad would like come visit us. vaccinated. However, 6 year old want put risk. Trying date 2020: omg you’re monster, staying home meeting anyone new!!!

Same people 2022: omg come one children???? topic because, again, *BRAZIL*. more, math class place talk horses. Go talk horses agricultural class. really hard. trying take one thing swedish media doing, take side. ruling way backed swedish strategy (especially beginning) lack critical questions FHM press conferences right absolutely backed begin with, results. no, lot critical questions conferences. probably noticed, questions praising either. Press conferences news general unemotional, understand that's shock someone expect people would protest horribly inefficient failed laissez-faire strategy lead many unnecessary deaths, instead get protest nutjobs 5g signs saying restrictions lots lots criticism pointed towards loose restrictions. I'm sure able understand yourself, people understand gathering groups hundreds make things bizarre. like they're living alternate We're living reality others, getting fucked highly contagious virus. alternate reality vibes I'm getting convincing Sweden somehow interesting special enough pandemic standpoint dedicate entire reddit account posting criticism it. I'm making excuses CDC, please interpret way. un-pin tweet.

I think understand feel need keep though.

I met someone suddenly put charge programming timing street lights medium-sized city. given goal reducing fatalities auto accidents.

They quit three weeks later. 

Why?

Every week they'd get report many crash fatalities been, gone week. went home shaking every day, ""omg, killed three people today programmed light such-and-such intersection.""

So misinform people? Absolutely not, that's okay. using position try scare people think right thing, go home thinking ""omg, thing might kill someone.""? think least little bit it. read threads nursing homes already lacking staff? already problem, it’s going fixed people. Late nights nursing homes get wild. I, too, cannot think myself. live Boston literally can’t go outside without mask. Run 20-30 miles per week intensely, best times since wearing mask full time runs improved across board PR’d. It’s mental thing. hard first adjust really large ask, especially working indoors. Yawn. I've done all... I'm gonna swing stupid parts LA load special freezy dry ice things checked luggage. Pretty sure they'll let waltz MIQ then, think? understand printing money causes inflation? 20% money circulation printed since March 2020? I'm optimistic all. okay. wear mask times big deal early January I'm walking around mask 100 degree, humid Florida heat. 

Other lines distanced, plexiglass dividers split lines up, etc. Wait lines rides bad, least went. one really knows. Data point spreading vaccinated. one knows much reduction spreading. Either way bet life it.


I would encourage get 60 year old get vaccinated. personally you, would still careful public still take precautions.

I know several people reverse--65+ got fully vaccinated still take precautions regularly interact younger 65 vaccinated Great, hope everyone wants vaccine gets  It’s big deal. It’s piece cloth mouth. It’s even remotely burqa symbolism behind it. really need say outright, you’ve got vaccine doses pandemic period. Make simple, straightforward, powerful incentive.  seen elderly (80s) parents year. best part vaccinated, vaccinated, get see again. sure would. half million dead pretty fucking grim Glad you’re getting vaccinated clinical trial buddy! way could see happening virus long incubation period asymptomatic infectious. killing right away probably gonna 20% IFR, since super deadly diseases tend kill quickly. really would perfect storm. Like 1,000 year type virus. understand need now, like living world smiling faces. Masks everyone outside hospitals public transit post-pandemic would depressing reminder terrible year. Also really hard understand people saying masks lol.

If people want wear past comfort, that's personal choice support it. Glad see I'm one. Surely like 1/4 1/3 America meets 30 bmi requirement. I'm getting mine tomorrow! ready nightmare over. people get bent shape, also lines low point using allotment day sites, lets know open up,” Taddeo told Post. “Our enemy right getting covid. It’s following rules point days go without using allotted amount vaccine.”     criticized “red tape” involved governor’s order. said she’s worried individuals medically eligible may access doctor, uninsured, get physician’s note.  almost like make rules, don’t think vulnerable many impediments might get things,” Taddeo said.

I think key takeaway article current documentation requirements site restrictive turn away folks ending low utilization. 

I think stage important cut nose spite face. stopped Sunday went back normal. Okay, however, let’s face facts here- kids contract covid HS opens, result school closures...which annoy people. Maybe wait 10 days spring break, avoid cases travel, etc. Yeah. husband miserably sick last February tested negative flu. I’ve bunch people tell “definitely” must covid. acting assumption zero proof. particularly nasty colds exist. wonder many people got covid assumed they’d already take precautions. basically then?  big outbreak flu last winter. feel like many people disregard assume covid. Really shocked waited CDC tell okay. vaccines extremely effective. Pretty soon we'll confirmation even one party fully vaccinated one-on-one meetup extremely low risk. Gathering unvaccinated individuals together thing risky enough avoid hugging parents over. really hope right! [Cleveland clinics say it’s rare, happened. wrong timeframe, found 6 month. CDC says virus past mean you’re immune. 

Honestly, what’s point telling people safe easily Google stuff? I’m trying say everything terrible, I’m saying don’t assume you’ve virus you’re immune forever, counting “immune” people, can’t use stat total cases, advanced medical research facilities telling us true.  lot irresponsible people world. 

I mean even get mad people talk constantly adjusting face mask air escapes talk. mean even know say people--if going pull mask away like even bother mask know, want risk place like Boise, Idaho, recently saw mask-burning ""event"" outside Capitol. level selfishness prove lethal, want open it.  ended ahead expected pace vaccines March 2020 nightmare fears January founded. Knowing know now, yes thankfully happen. Let's self righteous it.

Also post Israel. fully vaccinated significant contracted symptoms proof, 7th paragraph down. that's reddit works. Maybe that's problem Yeah basically forcing humanity back stone ages good enough :D ok. don’t feel superior 100% time

Take advice. America sucks, stop pretending good. leadership.

I used think that, really anymore. U.S. government could done much Trump could saved tens (or hundreds) thousands lives actually asking people take seriously leading example, always going significant portion U.S. population would refused stay completely locked six weeks. virus contagious slightly-better lockdown would unquestionably saved lives, would eradicated disease, would spread reopening. get (only) blame leadership one unfortunately. costs $10,000 kid US, $200,000 18 years, kid becomes unaffordable. Society needs support parents.

* There's lot debate whether additional $1,400 needed.

There's already extensive unemployment benefits, targeted relief, multiple stimulus checks - something countries *don't even provide*. Following another $1,400 PLUS billions pork may actually best interest country. There's plenty legitimate criticism bad country long-term. Ok adults sounds dumb doesnt lol. Bloomberg believes happen today. Far nuanced lizard brain. Downvote oblivion folks.

*tastes air*  “muscular people high BMI too” myth needs end. isn’t true. 33 BMI, you’re obese, muscular. don’t even know statement Arnold true. even is, fact point one muscular humans history proof tell something. Oh Loooorrrd. Cause streaming DVDs exist right? Dumbass LMAO Let rephrase explanation. past, people planning X kids matter what. Now, people plan X/2 conditions appropriate. main reason change philosophy, poor economic conditions, also plays role. Possible, we're 26,000 right big states like CA TX reported. Could 40k, close so. Every vaccine didn’t exist year started existing It’s good point best solution. Governors inject local politics.

I would argue best solution use preexisting supply chains (pharmacies, hospitals, doctors, etc) send supply. Texas might able demand take Houston's vaccines, they’re going kind power Walmart.   I'm senior year, set graduate 2021, family well. band kid mostly enjoying school reasonably well despite depression. I'm considering dropping getting GED there's way learn like this. reason I'm still school I'm functioning mom gets paid extra social security I'm labeled student.
I tell going peak high school anyways, still hurts. name mine Greenland Begging question whether they’ll continue watching Fox News nursing homes. young healthy, get disease, probably fine. probably. Many people young healthy dead disease, many permanent disability it. unusual, certainly rare.

If get vaccine, know virtual certainty fine, millions people taken already nothing bad happened it. first case new horrible complication, possible, barely.

So trading incredibly slight possibility crazy vaccine reaction real possibility getting disease ending dead disabled like many you. live commune early 2010’s chatbots or...? It’s almost like making fun let's fucking gooo

&amp;#x200B;

i love science!! cynical doom-scrolling inner demon immediately imagined “why both?” GIF. forget innocent people died? guys bombed another country also

Lmao thought another country better makes Americans mad 😂 go shoot school entered contracts, would set delivery schedule would based deliveries come from. known import EU. delivery schedules would different.

What EU vaccine nationalisation, thing EU said lambasted US doing.

Like said, EU want countries get vaccines EU themselves, clear start. EU quicker setting manufacturing, mess. Dont forget stores ban masks Send Brazilian dollars we’ll get started There's difference feeling informed keep safe reading much shit feel like joined death cult. Think way: you’ll getting shot within next 8-10 weeks, likelihood; 3 months worst. That’s also ~2 months chance getting COVID drop considerably anyway, due falling numbers. Plus weather getting really nice months. Lovely. already arrhythmia makes miserable. Really looking forward this. 1, ""number needle sticks reported"" essentially. wrong... mask Wyoming anymore Work home can; eateries open takeaway. 

What do? Shutting eateries completely almost nothing drives businesses under. It’s great hearing success vaccines. I’m eager US continue vaccinating high rates, every country needs put bed. Amazing science behind vaccines making possible. Incredible hear positive results. isn’t they’re saying lol Ever since TrumpBrexit, ranting ""democracy"" basically meant ""My ideas stupid there's evidence support them, get lot people vote them"", though best way run country following evidence ""The X-Factor"" popularity contests. Someone correct I’m wrong think depends. I’ve seen people lose 3-4 months 8 months well (on test is) Rise Resistance ride incredible. great trip! assume lot here. Getting COVID mean getting sick COVID vast majority people.

I it, symptoms. mother 68 it, symptoms works Healthcare. Rinse repeat. Data agree you.

Also, rained yesterday, back kinda hurt to. connected? Probably not, would easy say were. Maybe are, maybe aren't. Vegas ConstructionExpo show year ago next week. second largest show convention center people coming world.

This right mask wearing thing everyone using copious amounts hand sanitizer that's thought spread.

I'd shocked get then, knows. Never symptoms, hangover could masked lot it. went full curfew lockdown couple weeks Xmas positivity rates London topping 20% (similar SoCal's numbers). absolutely crushed Winter Surge compared California, willing another March/April type lockdown. think late January R rate transmission fallen .6 .7. fwiw, hard chart course US states region willing institute total shutdown economy weeks end. That's there's much concern. kind tool public health arsenal combat contagious surge. say that? (Regardless whether you’re sarcastic not) Dropped 255 172 getting covid kick ass friends got barely symptoms. I'm 22 feel like got new lease life. Best decision ever made well established colloquial term offspring age. match experience all. I'm also Colorado able log make appointment father Safeway last weekend, he's younger parents. sounds like need poke around more. friend lives went said strictly enforcing covid rules, still great time. Exactly! justs short sighted stance could take ... United States. Wow. Cases continue drop. look like we're plateau -- slowdown rate decline. Maybe ""spike"" variants? woow nice headline Give two weeks! LOL takes time develop immunity. Horniness much.

Seriously single, get selfie getting vaccine. might wonder's love life. makes easier base also helps try sow division. counties completely full vaccines problem vaccinating everyone it’s easier people think Abbott great job houstonians austinites etc. reacting vaccine woes everything else. makes base think he’s telling truth right thing clearly enemies politically motivated whiners it’s way around, again. Projection, again. Osterholms story year. used respect him. ignore like people. 

Even he’s right, nothing change see spike maybe even poor people get happened virus again. 

It takes hospitals collapsing get action people generally accepting thousand two deaths day COVID. made cool headline going Brazil. know antivaxx pro essential oil lady everyday scours anything throughout world seen Covid vaccine death updates number people “killed horrible vaccines”. 

Meanwhile want really talk relevant relationship Covid vaccines death look thousands people statistically saved point getting started. 

I find fascinatingly ironic obtuse would consider gung-ho prolife. one death dismissing people know thinks need let thing run it’s course. economy always recover. never met dead person could CDC doesn’t clearly realize misinformation always causes harm good, serious intelligence issues. Every time CDC public health official knowingly misrepresents information agenda, adds fuel fire conspiracy theorists. gives COVID-deniers opportunity say “well they’re lying/misleading us this, *else* must lying don’t know yet?” I’m tired fear porn. Drew Armstrong Bloomberg thinks happen today. I'm going count that. company able secure doses back giving group 1b. state weeks away opening group doubt I'll getting company get vaccination clinic state. warms Manhattan start come off. rarely wore outside (unless like 14th street) got cold, helped keep warm. hope encourages people get shots ASAP. Yea people aren’t waiting government say it’s ok. told wait vaccination. We’ve getting vaccinated. That’s far vast majority people going wait  google says  Two weeks recommended CDC reasonable gets better too. Protection appears increase steadily 56 days leveling Yes, mention triage. Yes, could deaths, given tradeoffs, seems acceptable. all, single 20 year old worth 3 65 year olds terms expected life years remaining. that's looking life years anything else. actual doctor? I’d interested hear reasons. I’ve read articles doctors said main concern saw political pressure regulators, White House threatened FDA head’s job Pfizer jab wasn’t given EUA Well, see, puts wrench T-Mobile's network Gladys-432-Milwaukee get transponder placed. supposed blanket country pink now, eh Another record setting Monday increasing first dose per day pass 1.3m. Without J&amp;J. 

Covid getting crushed. Sure, think Tinder going go trouble verifying medical records?

The best could offer little plaque bio, people could lie about, like people lie height, weight, appearance, job, income, etc... cats? odd stance. Even work won’t remove mask requirements vaccinated workers, they’ll probably remove community spread hospitalizations low...which happen enough people vaccinated. assume wear one relaxing home? big deal, right? It’s annoying numbers aren’t updated possible, given metrics going lead eventual re-openings. 

Every day matters context struggling business eager end. Enlarged lymph nodes nonspecific symptom people mistaking cancer covid vaccines probably hypochondriacs like me.  sheer number people still claim wore masks would've months ago disagree. plan include dropping dumbell foot. dumbell dumbell.

:) approved children anyway So. Fucking Close. Cases FINALLY dropping real levels. FINALLY vaccines given real numbers. We're close can't help apparently, we're damndest keep forever. got vaccine, I'm thankful. face 500,000 dead real end sight, half country still saying fuck it. level selfishness idiocy truly incomprehensible. Yes. apocalyptic imagery painted many media outlets excessive

This solely reader. relevant PhD nothing I've read news made said ""Oh shit, everyone going die"". folks reading news feeling fear, that's them, people read news feel TX CA, think everyone politics wants masks gone eventually.

Duh. That's whole point. People show complain ""other side"" hate stopping everything going back normal bullshit blaming group people rainstorm everyone wants end. It’s rough, students soooo done online schooling. Even students made honor roll last quarter fallen apart last 6 weeks winter. 

I’m thankful state made real progress Covid-19 infections vaccinations scoop kids back next quarter person classes. worry local rates, students need bad. greatly hope things close again, bars gyms schools. Yup. Loaded jumbo jets nary mask sight also keeping find evidence states earlier earlier thought. cough bad threw January 2020, confirmed cases area another 2 months. many things could been, wonder COVID. amazing Even anchor CNN insinuated pessimistic day worth it. First dose phase me. Second dose knocked ass 24 hrs fever/headache passed quickly came. That's immune system kicking high gear recognizes foreign substance ready fight. can't actually get covid vaccine. fever/chills/nausea/headache side effects body responds pathogens. watching NBA game started falling apart. Wednesday. scheduled go Hollywood Studios (the whole goal trip planning 2 years) next day. Lol posting history.

There tons easily accessible data showing clear path towards pandemic ending. take rocket scientist piece together point. Oh yeah, happen weekend? travel ban took effect everyone came back? Absolutely wild. yeah guess indoor dining already low risk even NYC claim real connection spread. Cuomo kept closed hated BdB got Pfizer! Easy peasy. I’m 21 work children. adequate? Tried look study way head. Antibodies fade believe 60 90 days. go memory cells remanufactured needed.  Coming back international flight week shit hit fan surreal. Lung scaring could could associated COVID. need people scaring scaring weight that.

You also need large n significance, need controls.

For instance high risk Individuals may already lung scaring. Smokers, asthma..etc. end showing symptoms upon x-ray show scaring also, mean prior documentation.

You able show this, say value. 

I'm saying possible small group people, saying looks connected is. 

A lot unclear. reason evidence based. evidence singular, much like mountain, demanding much below. Simplicity - average person pick shorter two times presented two, even patient info card saying something else. conservative safeguard human behavior likely. I'm really argue people, looking folks boat share feelings. based opinion heard experts say? so, post sources. patience important thing friend think anyone's asking Hell yea. scored appointment first dose thursday. Can't hurt.

I think local health boards also running online booking systems could check out. Advocating ""zero risk"" dangerous deeply harmful idea. ideology zero risk tries shut normal human life activity can't proved ""safe"".

We must stamp hard anyone tries this. Yup wear know there's requirement also enjoy it. dont enjoy picking dog shit always clean dog right thing do. wear mask currently necessary, dont see I'm also required love it!? friends able get leftovers far wife luck. going keep trying. Stop saying media, comes scientists. Around beginning Feb sub got flooded people want hate gripe, gets old. can't even accurately identify non-enemy. baby-bust  groups know first meet, gotta assume somebody group bitten, prove otherwise

Or.... everyone get naked first meet. Honestly, I'm good least guaranteed get cold/flu, right keep mutating we're never truly making progress. *Hopefully* spike protein stay long enough us get booster shots variants, never know. truly can't even comprehend level stupidity selfishness we're seeing face 500,000 people dead. Britain

Gold standard vaccination program, dogshit lockdown. Nice! got link Canada news? Might personal risk tolerance activities allowed. instance I'm still wary indoor dining, even though 50% capacity right am. get shot though (+3 weeks) hesitancy. pessimistic, times feels like always ""too soon"" lot people here.

That's pessimistic, that's realistic. We've watched goal posts move one end field straight stadium. reason believe move again.  Thanks breaking down! think that's I'm finding confusing, way CDC fully explaining decision making. Like kid low risk screw it, could catch prob fine? lol. strange way they're wording all. give go try get leftovers? hell, know majority people city produce documentation proving underlying. Make appointment go it, whats worst happen?  Love articles lot more. they're willing claim may many FOUR TIMES cases reported

I trouble believing actually understand this. good estimate truth death rate, compare observed death rate back-calculate. observed death rate US 3%. know COVID deadly. would take 4 times many cases make death rate match think it. Absolutely I'm going fucking pissed someone got vaccine. excited get it, cases dropping everywhere else, we're fighting variants trying keep pace, entire states saying fuck it. basically booster variant dose dumb shit, head going explode. selfishness can't even comprehended point. know vaccine likely still keep severe cases COVID matter happens, jesus christ. Yep, understand that. comment section CDC’s response - clearly understand reasoning for. I’m left wondering commented rebuke all. Dude can't even answer softball questions press. President surely actual leading (which probably best.) mean... actually truly lock month like many wanted could definitely slowed spread significantly. Many prepping month longer lock down. Jokes us. never actually lock year later. seems EU way much trust contracts would delivered good faith

And countries way much trust EU signed contracts good faith EU said would never anything like blocking Anyway, glad law amended finally utilized vaccines cannot exported without EU contracts met first.

So pissed vaccines coming UK happy vaccines coming EU? say ok go cruises? one prepared stay land? want people panic buy terrestrial vacations? Felt way. wanted informed got little doomsday stupid notion virus overrunning hospitals isolating people together would make partners suddenly think: let's kids! Instead reality people become annoyed one another existing kids, want avoid medical system costs. anything, may boom 2022 people reconnect summer fall. That's weird attitude me, maybe live state inconsistent nonexistent policies never enforced. know people like idea told do, doubt there's going suddenly armed mask police force checking peoples' vaccine records eat Applebees. essential workers may healthcare time off(standard western countries 4 weeks year btw except America).  However, get fancy pens commercials clapping them!  deal!  mean there's financial benefit kids-there isn't

Nobody said financial benefit it.

At point done less financial worries. Waiting kids there's money savings, debts paid down, stable job, etc. ""waiting makes financial sense"". That’s great news exact sentiment trying (apparently unsuccessfully) convey.  think base here. guidance follow guidelines public likely fact everyone access vaccine yet therefore way validate vaccinated unvaccinated public setting. again, fair world politics. again, money part politics would separate discussion. Pretty blatant ignoring talking yourself. say vaccinated people need wear masks public silent issue? size drop. drop 10.2% 2019. Nationally, 2017 2018 drop 2%.

&amp;#x200B;

California 18,000 births entire year. December 2019 December 2020 drop 3,740. suppose surprised follows Innovation/Technology Adoption Lifecycle theory applies new products, even defined phased elibility approach. Innovators (i.e. trial participants?) Early Adopters (i.e. health care workers opted in?) Early Majority Late Majority Laggards (i.e. get vaccinated supposed prove negative? lol  Please google ""covid vaccine safe"" inform yourself.

Did that. Found watched hour long video explaining germ theory wrong. what? daughter particularly vulnerable car accidents bear attacks would probably make risk calculus different others though. Yeah know someone NYC lost taste/smell &amp; sick, told stay home hospital overwhelmed. never got tested therefore never counted, clearly COVID. closed schools screw kids. CDC updated website. purposes guidance, people considered fully vaccinated COVID-19 ≥2 weeks received second dose 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna), ≥2 weeks received single-dose vaccine (Johnson Johnson). agree Trump also gotten worse last 10 years, considering that's happens age. Trump, seems he's normal 78-year-old deteriorating, whereas Biden, obvious mental issues (Dementia) making deterioration much quicker normal 80-year-old.

But can't legitimately sit compare Trump, stand hours upon hours rallies, Biden barely string coherent sentence together, struggles get words out, fumbles certain information, can't even take questions reporters 15 minutes goes bed ""early."" laughable. Trump, confident one actually governing, whereas clue feeding Biden given day say telling don’t care Biden speaks long he’s getting important shit done.

So care everyone around job he's figurehead paraded running another term anyways.

Something agree on. think so? I'm disagreeing you, I'm saying see dropping mask mandate satisfies desire re-open business. separate policy think gets lumped anti-maskers COVID restriction policies directly affect business opening disagree think pharmacies probably open 50-64 open everyone. think many (most?) states open age cohort yet they're large group (around 64 million). date US initiated vaccination 10.5M (or 16% age group). Difference many states using Gospel creating restrictions based CDC GUIDANCE. 


We don’t ban fast food smoking based CDC guidance, IMO. Especially considering nearing senior citizens fully vax quasi-open blatantly true April. think lot people assumption vaccine reduces transmission serviceable fine. also think particular situation would want harder data exact risks well. don’t know commenter snarky it. corrected 3 month. I’ll read information posted, probably change mind. trust science, redditors(no offense you, gave scientific studies) medical advice. information had, verified sources shorter timeframe. provided more, mine specific cases short, results different You’re right best/worst scenarios, you, comments ignoring completely go away time. I’ll continue say, however, unsure, playing safe better taking best case using foundation. think caught back April, couldn’t get tested state age, took till November feel like still recovering, day endurance completely shot. used run 5ks 1/2 Marathons, can’t anymore, least yet. I’m winded mile. I’m playing safe I’ve literally energy taken away year. protect variants moved goal posts Israel’s current case count long covid General question CDC 'count' vaccines. Obviously, '2 shot' doses. always made habit, least at, day CDC total 'fully vaccinated' count. comes count, one dose vaccine 2 counts or....how CDC count someone fully vaccinated virus J&amp;J? states it? Yeah noticed amazon choices sometimes without trying quickly realized W certain brand perfectly accurate. winter boots return twice fit Can’t wait till start treating heart disease like covid. fully vaccinated safe we’re going get right now.)

It's safe get unless eradicate COVID-19, probably happen anytime soon, all. One favorites calling ""The gay agenda"" merely trying assist overcoming sadness. There's also something else consider: Following pandemic 1918, saw ""the roaring 20s."" may live period life unlike prior generations, see indulgences excesses, jubilation, overcome COVID. sense, college age folks may live extremely gratifying period life us never got experience. always different way looking things. people opposed lifting restrictions?

Because lot choice go back work back office they've working home. article mentions vaccinated people visit unvaccinated people without masks unless unvaccinated individual(s) high-risk. vaccinated high-risk person? immunocompromised cancer patient two questions are: 
-Could safely hug vaccinated person, vaccinated myself?
-I would assume shouldn’t hug non-vaccinated person, would pretty safe around non-vaccinated people masks social distancing?  He's really made name acting like worst possible outcome also likely outcome. I'm bashing credentials anything, think enjoys stirring pot. People bash Fauci, imagine someone like Osterholm held position? state in? Even Tennessee pretty much open everyone right now, mean everyone come ""pre-existing condition"".. mean get left dose.  Thx! real challenge keeping weight life resumes normal! Dog can't wait get back airplanes.  winning? use Amazon Zappos almost exclusively shoes also luck Nordstrom Rack near online! husband, lost 25 pounds even office non-stop food admins throw chocolate he’s stressed. I’ve gained 5 pounds I’m cooking baking he’s home day went thin normal. want 5 pounds gone though, I’m waiting second dose return gym. hell people refer adult offspring come from? Wow, person who’s thesis based wistful thinking annoyance can’t defend position. Crazy. nothing comment true, told ad nauseum federal government, specifically FDA, CDC, NIH, arbiters experts. 

Also, claiming federal government intentionally crippled response q-anon level bullshit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thread incredible 😂 That's copout. Mature adults believe science care safety family close contacts continue so. Fortunately live low percentage COVID denying wingnuts result one safest places world be. Wow, really showed them! *""Off duty cop plays football local kids. Nobody dies.""*

There ya go. I'd say less Wyoming residents swaths Yellowstone visitors start visiting around Memorial Day weekend. Exactly, point giving priviledges vaccinated demand drops phases completed. happens, 100% move 2 tier society bring demand back up. right reason really jump line, best believe people full force line jumping made clear get advantages them, line jump away comes since open everyone wait institute 2tier society then. sadly many mainstream stores rarely carry anything size 12, let alone wide, look specialty stores smaller local places specific brands contracted cost average Nikes. 

I France despite husband husband considered normal height always laugh shoe size haha going need another booster, maybe can't get ahead Look bud. lie still lie whether intentional not. Classic Officially fully vaccinated 28 days J&amp;J, 2 weeks pfizer/Moderna, either 5 weeks 6 depend type. 

In real life, pfizer/moderna pretty much protected 2 weeks first shot. dont know data specifically J&amp;J. We're never actually going get past first wave, we? like kiddy pool keep peeing keep water level up... Hubby stint overseas bored worked Marines every day. He's 6'2"" - came home ~215 pds SKELETON gives BMI 27 - suggested weight 190 BMI chart LAUGHABLE. younger son 6'0"" 165 appears 0 body fat frame, looks fine. Places like Wyoming much easier open rather places like Californian metropolitan areas New York. high rise office buildings, little reliance public transportation less points social interaction. vaccination giving immunity boost, might pull opening state without increase infections. doesn’t mean they’re lying. Journalist wasn’t specific enough, usually people start asking “wait fo mean confirmed actual” they’ll update report.

Journalists humans too, sometimes make mistakes, sometimes take things know granted. everything big media conspiracy.

That said, Fox sucks ass even trying objective, cnn kinda sucks nearly bad. want good news, use NYT (non-opinion), Reuters, WSJ, LAT, use head.

Edit: oh, look international outlets too, since it’s always easier objective outside looking Ugh, bodies slow? take 28 days produce antibodies? Can't begin producing faster earlier? Perhaps there's something could eat like certain vitamin could help? Oh well, suppose cannot avoided. It’s cdc website.

People considered fully vaccinated:

2 weeks second dose 2-dose series, like Pfizer Moderna vaccines, or
2 weeks single-dose vaccine, like Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen vaccine That’s great! hyperbole. take world class athlete. personally know least 6 people friends &amp; family circle qualify obese technically 6-pack. 

Regardless arguments efficacy BMI measure health, point context COVID, higher BMI number ~40 (as UK chosen) makes sense talking prioritizing ""Obese"" chronic illnesses. wrong brother’s seasonal firefighter one state lives another, drove 24h roundtrip twice get shots. Wild. many months people told stay home, stay isolated, assume disease, don’t come hospital unless can’t breathe. weren’t enough tests months, even number undercounted. I'm paramedic exposed *multiple* times confirmed covid-19 patients, still manage get tested. reaction ""if get sick, presumed covid."" based confirmed cases. Need get least 50% vaccination country wide even begin open back up. numbers game premature openings take us back were. We’ve patient enough point, try waiting bit longer don’t fuck up. know situation every country government followed advice since beginning.  like Sweden Germany? believe certain states' Republican parties added resistance lockdowns platforms. fully expect we'll see laws form future mask requirements states end year. course would years enjoy life. college experience one people fondly remember. It’s unreasonable someone sad experience. Different approaches exact thing. share whole bunch properties. need something doom gloom about. RemindMe! 1 month Great job! 🙌 Excellent. Time move then... need 85% 90% people vaccinated, though, especially considering many people care least covid already gotten say 330 million numbers that’s 150 days. 

But that's based last week's numbers. know there's 20 million J&amp;J shots month 75 Moderna Yes first 2 weeks biggest improvement get shot, it’s 2 weeks second dose you’re “vaccinated”.

The virus care people ""consider vaccinated"". shot already plenty effective two weeks initial shot. 

I guess we're talking past point, unless there's another huge winter storm someone blows production facility, inevitable. end April, going pandemic United States. Oh see, hope y'all stay safe."
