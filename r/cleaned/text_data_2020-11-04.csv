0,2020-11-04," recommend book called 'the finance curse'? Blew mind.  ?!?!?! Rarrrrgh. 

Even trust experts everything need know Google Scholar? totally insane idea people could gullible might. Wizard's First Rule thing getting me.

I feel like gave challenge room 16 year olds experience would made better decisions.

If ever become zillionaire I'm buying Island inviting people pass 'Spock logic' 'good heart' test. really work teams half game apart standings. include nursing home staff? I've never seen explicitly mentioned think would. rookie numbers Exactly, lol. Plus I'm seeing Nazi stuff everywhere.... unreal. keep thinking 'this happening'. possible manage things badly. I'm sure he's ever worried powers anything. He'll act first, try rationalise afterwards. Yes others increase well Sweden higher per capita others increasing. spite Tegnell‚Äôs predictions. taking piss right? Yes, booming economies despite huge death, would thunk.

|20,345|819|\-8.2%| scary! think possible people dumb... feels like floor dropped there's pilot plane. soon figure use cure male pattern balding erectile dysfunction. Guy looks like put miller lights basket cheese curds problem. happen go away gets worse? people do? going abliterate entire West impact many countries. scientist, genuinely cannot believe happening. People UK (who also scientists) telling 'yeah always going come UK'..... FREAKIN ISLAND! incredibly simple problem understand dirtied up. IFR fixed universal number, IFR New York City particular period.

IFR change depending demographic, location, wealth country/people, hygiene, prevalence mask, access early testing, treatment, sex, time, underlying condition etc. 

Let's look two real world example, IFR COVID 19 Singapore 0.05%, much lower flu. Italy's IFR 4.5%. 

The reason huge difference virus hit Singapore [milder [virus hit generally young active group (construction workers), experience dealing another coronavirus outbreak (SARS), early access know [Vitamin deficiency plays part increasing tropical country like Singapore, basically summer year round, vitamin deficiency unlikely condition.

Compared Italy, virus hit [older probably [some suffering Vitamin due equator, need remember first wave, hospitals Northern Italy overwhelmed, forcing medical professionals [ration care ICU driving IFR up. 

While IFR give us picture deadly disease is, accurate picture especially take context, especially [ongoing outbreak novel example, case SARS, [IFR South Africa means deadly ebola (50% ~), smallpox (30% ~), nipah virus (40 75%) hendravirus (57% ~). 

But wait sound right, right? reason infected person country disease died.

Without knowing studies referring get numbers, whose say IFR Taiwan South Korea, scale population countries balance countries like USA Brazil? Knowing absolutely nothing making completely random accusations evidence? quite obviously even check comment history see ludicrous statement lol. 

I bet made feel lot smarter. Whatever helps sleep night. change facts though lol Wait actually 1K people dying day? That‚Äôs chemical warfare numbers. I‚Äôm acc scared. Came say want live world masks longer mandatory, never want one again, care people do. waving Ottawa!!!! ( snowed bit lol) says second column- 'US: 93,977 | Sweden: 1,178' ""foreseeable future"" I'm almost impressed incredibly vague is. punched??? Ya lost? Stumbling sub? Good luck... Thanks. 85% come bars restaurants? financially held responsible plane delay, rerouting passengers whatever... money fix her...

Who kidding... can‚Äôt fix shit. Happy end coronavirus day everyone! make great point... I. agree u.  Im drinking beer watching malcom reed smoke turkey thanksgiving. listening Katatonia background. unwind detach day. try feel little normalcy. normal person again. read comments can. Comment feel real input beneficial. thank comment. Im nite. good one. safe. Holy crap, that's even higher horrible summer peak AZ. bigger population. üò£ Going cvs today saw poster door talking it. It‚Äôs coming sooner think.  almost like governor gives battling spread career bad things happen. BS excuse letting local health departments handle issue BS. chicken shit move shows true colors. I'm pissed vote Senate, promoting challengers wins.  Get it. Fast, can. vaccine coming sooner think doesn‚Äôt give fuck think. enough Western developed vaccines stage III trials supply Europe, US, Canada, UK probably Latin America.

Let Chinese supply poorer nations Asia Africa. 3rd leading cause death state completely agree sentiment. feel bad makes feel better idiocy limited states. also wish case. Alright. OMG City Museum best. museum, ten story jungle gym! Take kid excuse climb airplane roof go ""Zeeeeeooow!"" 

Also, I'm Rural MO masks hardly seen cases also skyrocketing. Well collective Dutch stubbornness begs differ.. Fair. spend day ICU though, sub? Psychologically something completely unrelated pandemic enjoy. us powerless people living middle nowhere spend time here. 

But ever need help anything, please ask. China 3 vaccines stage III trials. one them. could avoided whole lot bullshit nationwide mask mandate, government gave regular people enough money, selfish assholes held large gatherings back spring summer. Never said sure hell would nice option. Trust independent universities organizations actually publish scientific studies experts supposed listening to. Read studies, decide yourself. google topics interested worried about. I.e. ""Sars-cov-2 study foods"". vaccine bros worldometer.

Daily new covid cases Sweden (7 day rolling average): 2658

Daily new cases per million: 254

Last checked 259 fact greater 254.

Thanks non-existent spanner, guess? Want back? told airplane 1/100 crashing would get plane? take know unfortunately. One way make florida red 2 Billion WHO's distribution plan less developed (poorer) countries.

China, US, EU, UK, Russia, Japan, Australia, Israel probably dozen countries already made arrangements vaccine manufacturers. Europeans-stopped laughing us. DOI? nothing. Oh sorry. looking lung image thought meant that. You‚Äôre right long term issues. brain feels like vibrating speed light. sorts things could happen, personally, well love care for, there's lot stake. clue mate. Cardiovascular disease accounts average 1400+ deaths per day USA. man livid. Nobody fed going listen this. Ok title wrong implies Sweden tops US cases time list. ""We recommend things"". -Government

""Great problem, enforcing rules?"" -Citizens

""No"" -Government

*2 months later*

""We know cases keep increasing"" -Government yet, voting fuckturd. actually read links triggered from? literally compare ""daily new cases, ""Total Cases"".

It says second column- 'US: 93,977 | Sweden: 1,178'

There's also link verifies source spurious. 

Kinda throws spanner works there, mate.

Bye. Yeah, skewering kebabs it. Ha. pointing lot IFR CFR whatever else percentages. Regardless....**percentages virus currently still going around killing infecting people dramatically changing numbers day day basis futile.** 3 people died ICU today recorded statistic. simply stating ventilators kill people touted publicly many times. meant like symptoms long covid flu thing bad e-cig detected safe? isn‚Äôt like flu. article articles explains damage lungs caused covid reparable unlike flu. Actually you‚Äôre wrong. actually look article OP posted? TL;DR: moment, mental economic health costs closures justify decreased COVID transmission. Nonetheless, people Ottawa must continue remain vigilant practice good habits. #RECOMMENDATIONS 

Communications

‚Ä¢ Ensure changes Stages announced least two (2) business days enactment give business operators time prepare.

‚Ä¢ Promote messaging three Cs (crowded places; close-contact settings, especially people close-range conversations; confined/enclosed spaces poor ventilation) highlight risk transmission COVID-19 highest avoided.

‚Ä¢ Discontinue messaging ‚Äúsocial circles‚Äù ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù. communications keeping close contact people households plus 1 2 people provide essential social support used instead, ensure consistency everyone understands central importance keeping number close contacts small minimize chance exposure COVID-19.

‚Ä¢ Increase awareness throughout province individuals wear masks wear masks properly (over nose mouth).

‚Ä¢ Increase provincial education regarding 2-metre distancing, hand hygiene isolating symptomatic.

‚Ä¢ Encourage workplaces continue supporting employees work home transition employees work home decrease community transmission possible.

Masks

‚Ä¢ Require mask use indoors times settings outdoors physical distancing challenge interacting outside household.

‚Ä¢ addition cohorting protective barriers, regardless 2-metre distancing, masks must worn whenever individuals interacting sharing space coworkers, times work settings indoors even outdoors physical distancing challenge).

‚Ä¢ Provide official provincial guidance regarding construction cloth masks (materials design). Currently public adequately protected mask poorly constructed, especially poor filterability, breathability, fit.

Restaurants, bars nightclubs event spaces

‚Ä¢ Align criteria indoor gathering limits matter venue (restaurants, conference centres, meeting event spaces) require always enough space patrons different parties.

‚Ä¢ Require patrons wear mask interacting server staff leaving table process eating drinking.

‚Ä¢ Encourage hand sanitizer made available table facilitate hand hygiene handling one‚Äôs mask.

‚Ä¢ Continue current regulations: person shall dance, sing perform music establishment except stated ONTARIO REGULATION 364/20.

‚Ä¢ Encourage businesses provide safer spaces staff breaks ask staff socialize workplaces beyond work hours without precautions.

‚Ä¢ Ensure venues open long enough avoid promoting gathering less-controlled spaces.

Gyms fitness centres

‚Ä¢ Require minimum physical distance (2m) activities.

‚Ä¢ Require masking gym fitness centres times staff patrons.

Team sports

‚Ä¢ team sports, continue support scrimmages games take place.

‚Ä¢ Limit access locker rooms, clubhouses, amenities washrooms, emergency aid equipment management.

‚Ä¢ Limit pre/post group activity gatherings (carpooling, team meals, parking lots etc.), encourage mask use whenever possible play (use always mandatory outside play practice).

‚Ä¢ Prohibit coaching training staff rotating across various teams cohorts players enable larger number people ice facilitate cohorting one group coach training staff.

Personal Service Settings (PSS)

‚Ä¢ Require businesses operate appointment record patron‚Äôs name contact information.

‚Ä¢ Require staff wear medical grade masks face shields.

Measures (such regular masking, proper distancing, hand hygiene, minimizing social contacts) require hard work personal sacrifice. small price must pay order prevent COVID-19 transmission maintain improve economic activity avoid harms caused unemployment increasing mental distress. believe people Ottawa learn coexist COVID, care.

Thank consideration. always, available discuss measures time. thought Europe lot better us

theres safety fast spreading deadly virus specially smooth brains still meeting claiming covid dangerous world wide... writing recommend new approach COVID-19 pandemic, protect health population Ottawa. current harms health arising societal disruption significant measures limit COVID-19 transmission Ottawa must sustainable balanced following end modified stage 2 restrictions implemented province October 10, 2020. approach recommending learn coexist COVID, care.

The goals response pandemic continue minimize hospitalizations death, well societal disruption. rate people testing positive COVID-19 viral load measured wastewater started stabilize second half October. suggests efforts people Ottawa keep distanced people outside households, wear masks indoors also outdoors proper distancing possible, keep hands clean stay home sick making difference. modified stage 2 closures reduced incidence close contacts higher risk settings supported declining levels virus community. Going forward, emphasis must remain importance individuals part businesses reopening.

The rationale continuing measures limit COVID-19 transmission includes: per cent people testing positive COVID-19 declined still sitting 2.7%, areas city even higher rates; number outbreaks remains high, leading hospitalizations deaths; potential rapid virus spread remains let guard become complacent, given ongoing widespread incidence virus lack significant population immunity.

The rationale adjust measures enable businesses open ramp operations includes signs majority people Ottawa part limit COVID-19 transmission asked situation serious; negative impacts health population unemployment closure businesses resulting pandemic; peoples‚Äô need supports help live COVID-19 winter foreseeable future time reported mental health challenges high end sight pandemic.

Little evidence exists determine right balance COVID-19 control measures supporting economic activity keep people employed mitigate mental health harms, though Ottawa Public Health (OPH) monitors situations practices world-wide. Data collected case contact management processes recently indicates significant blind spots occurring situations covered provincial municipal regulations. continue see problem areas public gathering extended family larger friend circles, well socializing playing team sport, travelling sports practice without wearing mask. Similarly, school return added transmission pressure particularly relation socializing way school activities ancillary school. also see transmission occur bars, restaurants physical activity enclosed spaces without mask use.

Transmission COVID-19 occur setting given opportunity. large part solution managing risks lies modifying behaviours. risk higher wherever people less two metres apart wearing masks. Within closed spaces, even measures prevent COVID-19 transmission. People gathering closed spaces, close contact without masks across community, including home non-household members.

In discussions members community, received feedback specific behaviours residents Ottawa feel putting community higher risk resurgence. Engage Ottawa platform ‚Äì online portal engage residents ‚Äì people reported dining indoors; attending indoor events maximum 50 people; going bar nightclub; attending indoor party gathering friend‚Äôs home particular concern. examples reports larger gatherings private settings COVID-19 control measures place. Thus, another rationale opening businesses harm reduction approach, minimize private underground gatherings higher risk oversight and, often, COVID-19 mitigation controls place minimize transmission.

Ottawa Public Health collected input inform recommendations COVID-19 control measures stakeholders, including populations higher risk (such long-term care home stakeholders, newcomers racialized communities), hospitals, business associations, industry leaders, city departments, members public email, petition social media.

Work community partners better identify address needs racialized low-income communities critical progressing. thankful many partners, including city, engaged work.

I looked levels unemployment resulting COVID-19 pandemic response, indicators mental health community, challenges arising backlog surgical medical procedures concluding needs done enable people return usual supports services lives.

Similar schools able open precautions place, businesses able open precautions place. People able learn live COVID-19, caution. guess shoulda read it, eh? Testing booked week uppsala. total number test is, tell you. 

May ask think Sweden worse hitler? Normally, lurk see responding getting heated lads, wanna know everything. Like Swede break heart? holiday Sweden postponed corona? favorite safari animal? want know all. wanna hear full explanation better understand arguments. Thanks findings indicate COVID-19 simply disease caused death virus-infected cells, likely consequence abnormal cells persisting long periods inside lungs,‚Äù said Mauro Giacca, professor King‚Äôs College London co-led research team analysed samples tissue lungs, heart, liver kidneys 41 patients died COVID-19 Italy‚Äôs University Hospital Trieste February April telephone interview, Giacca said that, research team found overt signs viral infection prolonged inflammation organs, discovered ‚Äúreally vast destruction architecture lungs‚Äù, healthy tissue ‚Äúalmost completely substituted scar tissue‚Äù. Well Brazil seems okay despite letting COVID run wild reopening borders entire world. Russia refused enact measures despite insane number cases second wave. Florida Texas. ‚ÄúA simple forced cough.‚Äù

-the article spending money less enthusiasm places like Russia, Brazil Florida refused lockdown matter what? there's idiots government? Come on. remindme! 1 month isan incredibly archaic system. centralized record vaccines suspect even was, paid doctor, nurse, NP, PA, etc. enough money play ball, would falsify records easily. way ensure doesn‚Äôt happen draw blood ensure antibodies present. paperwork goes directly employer, never touches employees hands. thought Europe lot better us, turns we‚Äôre little worse per capita. Wonder happened. Well, shit. Based. explain massive explosion cases countries Europe mask mandates months? experience here. slides murder bum buttons, definitely keep mind.

I'm going back Summer 2022! new aquariums running then. popular narrative much better treatment IFR lower. Early ventilation recommended early on, 85% ventilators died NYC (no source) stopped that. 

Did effect mortality? idea. IFR drop substantially summer, according UK ons's surveillance testing. since doubled again, might seasonal simply due fewer nursing home infections. back near 1% (the serosurveys UK spring would put around 1.2% then, 0.4% summer surveillance testing).

Frankly, I'm habit prefacing claim IFR near 1% disclaimer avoid argue. see reason believe less 1% population dead spring. central problem IFR estimates assume given set age demographics, assume medical care available. absolutely guaranteed population medical care disease progresses natural herd immunity areas high portion elderly people. Arguing much ventilators remdesevir dex save people pretty pointless know available small fraction sick people. I'd hope not, least poorer countries resources produce develop get first.

Priority China south east Asia developing nations Africa Central Asia Latin America / South America Western developed countries Here's case/death charts states, running 7-day dire curves. states two #1 #3 terms 7-day per capita death highly doubt schools would actually close here, considering closed first wave public pressure. happy see serious measures finally taken, though! generally true, case think takes time plan, execute, write study like this. work healthcare research difficult turn study around months. 

By way, work large proportion women, though many people color. herd immunity hast kicked guess knew! sad, hopefully people open eyes soon actually read chart complaining about? It‚Äôs comparing ‚ÄúDaily New Cases‚Äù ‚ÄúTotal Cases‚Äù. told us excited vaccine. sure response might gotten asymptomatic. already sustained copious amounts drain bramage listening anti-maskers bitching covid 24/7 New Yorker here- same, even earlier. Like right NYE. thing around WAY longer think now. 104 14 days ended kidney infection (apparently 1/3 do, would thought?) end it.  Honestly lets die hacking lungs out. thing convince bastards actively seeking spread deadly virus amongst populous. all, aint better way ""the libs"" (whoever anymore) watch die via mucosal asphyxiation. let plane unmasked? get plane masked take off? require masks prior boarding should. many flights kicking people wearing mask don‚Äôt understand allowed unmasked unless took off. worked (I still employed Furlough forever guess) catering Bartender/ waiter NYC virus spreading around guess. busy season, still like 3 shifts week so. went birthday crowded bar late Febuary. shocked never got virus. is. thats even discussing cytokine storm - alone morherfucker. America care masses die. That's pretty fucking crystal clear quick common....ripcrackle.....quick common....ripcrackle....quick common.....0 tried drawing Mohammed line areas hard hit. Pages 31 32. It‚Äôll magically gone tomorrow. usual hysterical bullshit Similar story here. I'm PA. never sick. Doc said flu, know was, seeing lot whatever was. never know sure now, suspicions. Hey mods!

I'm calling say thanks pretty tolerant diverse points view. 

He shouts void sloppy drunk. Also comma splice. 20% New Yorkers antibodies. Long term damage lungs kidney failure though? Holy acronyms Batman. That's 4 months, rookie numbers. Idiocracy (2006?) predicted scenario. Work (I'm fitness instructor), grocery store really two places think could contracted. save lives people sick first place hence poor survival rate without ventilators, would die - ventilators X% survive woudlnt without. 

I would imagine big enough percentage make worthwhile since hospitals worldwide employing  Hm? Norway way lower according ECDC Denmark slightly higher per capita last 14 days. two countries compare Sweden to. small *is* he? asthmatic, pandemic virus causes respiratory illness? likely smart enough know suffering doesn‚Äôt refer horrible painful life ending things. It‚Äôs completely valid word use. New case numbers Europe seem trending positive direction. Belgium 5k new cases spiking 24k last week. 
From study:

Results: validated subjects diagnosed using official test, model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity 98.5% specificity 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). asymptomatic subjects achieves sensitivity 100% specificity 83.2%.

Sensitivity detecting positives accurately

Specificity excluding false negatives accurately. 

They tested people app, followed traditional tests. seriously ignorant? people needed catch connecting flight? arguing? business? effect involving yourself? Speculation - believe heat detected pain receptors, taste buds, think would still get heat.

But want know! Well, probably cost money develop, costs money produce, yea, probably cost money buy make sure future development continues. technology here, needed money political SARS-CoV-2 provided. it‚Äôs going get better anytime soon  Yes. Conductor says ""Now approaching Graveyard Station""  You‚Äôre right forget something. It‚Äôs actually back barn. Meet there? Yeah fair painful lol level missing lot. probably reach NYC levels, infected quickly. Wow, really describes feel covid, thanks. (Spouse ER) wouldn‚Äôt care got infection fatality rate different case fatality rate. IFR refers number deaths based true infections (i.e. whether recorded not). CFR number deaths based recorded cases (i.e. positive tests/diagnoses). instance since probably trust Russian media This! son teacher NYC. came home Christmas last year sick hell late January early February! 105 fevers week. crawl around apartment would get breath. hit house Ohio two weeks later. Oh wait US want infected dick! also shipping box keep cold several days long open twice per day replenish dry ice. wait information heart, know (I don't).

Then multiply cardiovascular damage accumulating time, self reinforcing cycle covid damage. Infected damage infected damage, etc. 

I mean that's way looking, me. Ooh, trick question! multiple infections probable, basically admitted Fauci transitive property vaccines...

It's almost like lung / heart damage might stack up, year year, thus reducing person's overall lifespan. Also weakening person future covid infections.

It's almost if. Craggy, tight bends. access catheter far up. increased risk stroke dislodging plaque.

The cool part detached LIMA left pectoral area, attached straight Aorta, re-attached LAD blockage 80% blocked! Implicit bias hell drug. May particularly, aggregate certainly is. Common sense, one hardest hit &amp; China massive population ties France bound happen believe it‚Äôs known vascular disease time now. would facing even deadlier phases time passes people follow norms. Yeah vaccine coming 2 weeks sure 100 million units readily available within minutes discovering vaccine. Mr. President said true.  Fair last year, guess... Wow. wish living rock 7 months! wonder people would voting today? read news /s Suffer? definitely quarantine camps. yes amazingly ass. good sign, co-operation.

Its bad sign, need use it.

Simple. Hopefully might give Belgium little breathing room (pardon pun) ramp capacity. I‚Äôve done neither.  Haven‚Äôt bar restaurant since first week March Fair enough USA needed atleast one thing sustainable war. don‚Äôt really care I‚Äôd like never reminded pandemic ever again. 4 roommates, two degrees, one going graduate school, another IT. 

They going kill covid they're 'concerned' things going. 

They're fucking idiots. Covid winning right they're running score Mortality staying low. Looking good far. bet numbers underreported data becomes available, real deaths 50% 100% currently reported. specificity % tell us?

I can't tell rhetorical question not, case [here's wikipedia page read specificity %, along understanding [false positive tell everything need know false positives rate. Neighbour? dont one unless wrong here.. Feelings. people prefer bury head sand rather deal facts. Arkensas Arkensaw?

Is 2 different places?  Yep elective means non-emergent surgery (e.g. person emergency room needs immediate life-saving surgery)  Yes. Melbourne forced long hard winter lockdown even pretty strong half-measures cutting get numbers lower. thing extremely seasonal. I‚Äôve going gym Texas, everyone wearing masks it‚Äôs strict wear mask airport? really need needlepoint hang wall daily reminder maybe repeatedly disappointed. south beach Miami...most places required masks get in..beaches packed all. curfew midnight. restriction. Also night clubs closed.  morons voting Trump, unbelievable. seeing anything tested group healthy people see also saying Covid. Could saying every cough Covid cough control group. thought rounding corner? /s Well lot people told taught they're feelings matter reality. lot ways they've managed warp reality fit beliefs. virus however cannot stopped belief. good scary level, virus juxtaposed pretty much everything they've told even though keep trying say virus ending, over, lockdowns work, wearing masks work, facts lining that. going nasty reckoning eventually forced reconcile beliefs reality facts actually determine reality. must federal law first rate false positives? Identifying 97 100% helpful also getting big number false positives.

From [the validated subjects diagnosed using official test, model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity 98.5% specificity 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). asymptomatic subjects achieves sensitivity 100% specificity 83.2%.

What specificity % tell us?

I see abstract, anyone see full study discussion false positives? I'm watching election returns proves actually makes wonder, locked enough beat Covid, many diseases would permanently disappear?

It won‚Äôt happen, would fascinating see results. Arrested violating federal law?

Those voting this, understand federal law mask Implying white people inherintly biased research extremely offensive. mention racist itself. Covid compared Influenza virus instead Corona Viruses? 

In comparison Corona viruses Covid immensely deadly. Far deadly merely 5 10 times deadly. Thousands times deadly say common cold. 

The flu spherical filamentous virus. described here. 

By electron microscopy, influenza B viruses virtually indistinguishable. spherical filamentous shape, spherical forms order 100 nm diameter filamentous forms often excess 300 nm Flu valid comparing AIDS Rabies. *February u/KRegister said Good. Brazil getting hammered. thing initial containment measures. gets out, game even containment done rather well. China failed us researching quicker onto Trump failed us arguably harder dismantling pandemic response team who's entire purpose existence prevent happening thing happened. didn‚Äôt dry cough don‚Äôt think shortness breath now, maybe didn‚Äôt covid. Cool. understand it, count antibodies testing COVID-19 immunity, regardless relationships T-cells B-cells. He's better without him. I'm american so, fortunately mental health, I'm aware dumb shit Trump said, thanks bringing cursed frase lol Same, Best wishes yours. person dumb I‚Äôm surprised stand breathe time. Masks... don‚Äôt stop surface transmission... oh god. said ""sustained""...so now?(i kNoW wErds MeEn) NJer - incredibly sick Christmas &amp; New years still convinced Covid. really could been, also could nasty brand flu. repository symptoms high fever week Yeah that's international organizations work. unbelievable think countries could agree authority threat exists?

You know every country shut down?

You know 7700 people per day died 2017? REALLY believe 2020 show significant increase 8700 even 8000 deaths per day?

It's really amazing see people unafraid share real thoughts they're praised nonsense. record covid hospitalizations, today higher record reported. know third-world rural area from, hospitals normally fill I-I don‚Äôt understand..

I'm sure feel way lot. Hard dumb, huh? even surprising dumb start think smart. perfect useful. Read study again, confusing sensitivity accuracy.

Most tests made sensitivity specificity, singular measure. Yeah way. average freezer reach temps, need special equipment. Same! staying Nyack time; rode city 23rd pick Invisalign ‚Äì walking among throngs people Midtown time. Next day, bf sickest he‚Äôs ever life: painful dry cough, could barely get bed 3 days, fever. said really felt like could die. Two month later he‚Äôs getting winded walking stairs, like him. Couldn‚Äôt get antibody test last month; tested negative. still suspect Covid last December.  guess thats patience faith come handy. clinging right now. friend pregnant (due late November). pretty careful, worries quite bit! knew risk pregnant women, didn‚Äôt think high! really interesting something read - link trust could read? It‚Äôll disappear right election. Give another day two. true. Corporations take advantage stupid people. Always have, always will. cruise lines desperate. industry sinking. opposite people still saying next April. weaker strain stayed China stronger strains got exported ... could planned better. understand Chinese ready lock everything based imported strains.

Not necessarily. reading article saying may population-level genetic factors making East Asians susceptible one strains, making harder export gain foothold populations. 

We really see second paper reference that's peer review though, I'm sure much clearer picture now. major heterogeneity terms infectious people are. Something like 60% people never infect anyone else something like 80% new cases come 15% spreaders. might even advanced anyone else. takes someone looking data go little hope findings taken seriously. wouldnt surprised find years CDC got reports mysterious illness like typical life beaurcratic organizations got put back burner, filed away lost.


I UPJ obstruction never caught one nurse took blood pressure thought little high 12 year old. Two weeks later I'm seeing urologist discuss procedures parents. nurse inkling doctor decided tests. mostly state effort. Feds pushing us open sooner simply live virus amongst us. CDC R0 pegged around 2.5 since July. Influenza around 1.5, smallpox around 6, measles teens. 

SARS-2 moderately contagious. paper uses wrong methods. diversity Earth March descended diversity within China month January. No, wasn't, least uncontrolled outside China. sparks landed around world Nov Dec, none seem created sustained outbreak. diversity Earth March descended diversity within China month January, going phylogenetic trees. November highly unlikely. likely asymptomatic case recently. USA! ‚Äú**Up to** seven months post contracting‚Äù - NYC hit hardest March April. seven months pretty much up...*if count!* statistics show otherwise news reports early pandemic health care workers would go (and discard) 40+ masks shift, hospitals set Covid wards, hospital regulations required fresh PPE patient interaction prevent cross transmission. 

I pushing articles N95 masks could safely sterilized 1993 SARS mild heat elsewhere March, knew supplies would never keep usage. health care workers stretching single day's mask consumption March months. 

Personally, I've rotated 3 N95s far year, discard smell became unbearable. think headstrap KN95s stocking stuffers immediate family... 134,532 number positive tests. number people tested far higher. know exactly many, though. that's true. vaccines discovered couple hundred years. animals fighting viruses hundreds millions years. need observed 90 per cent people detectable antibodies seven months post contracting Sars-CoV-2. Absolutely. hardest part people side keep hearts open people refuse open theirs. half country going try vote asshole let happen right back office.... 

Sometimes wonder brought kids fucked world There‚Äôs speculation proper phase 3 could take us late 2021 still 70% effective, hard say point Life teaching long hard lesson right now. given sound mind compassionate heart reason, use it. people refuse that. Thanks posting. reason fast get ketosis.

Acetone(ketone) produced we're ketosis breaks fibrotic Lol, you‚Äôre tool dumb realize wrong are. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§´ Dude sister Trump conspiracy theory believer shes best ally got besides God parents life avoid ignore topic says anything bc black hole, hope snaps one day. would hilarious someone neither Dutch American (I'm South African) - interesting differently maskless-ness perceived. America blamed ""right-wing"" hicks ""idiots/brainless"", yet rhetoric exist Dutch. end day, thing? Dutch also lambasted anti-mask, get ""stubborn"" whereas what's written mask-less Americans lot derogatory.

Edit clarify mask stance: firm mask wearer, this. sub months, question critical/cruel/derogatory people Americans places bad (if worse). take refuse put back on. Herd immunity possible without vaccine Longer, actually. She‚Äôs safety risk. can‚Äôt someone plane might follow directions emergency. want airlines share lists ban people air travel. Maybe 7 years, try That's people downplay really bother me. got SARS, swine flu, ebola, MERS, etc., came us actually proactive wear masks ""We've tried nothing, we're ideas"". Something affect least. r/iamverybadass Oh no! ever go without getting injured rather focusing work? numbers Fauci sharing back March. Odd NBC feels need repeat new info.

Unfortunately flies face WHO's best estimates

**WHO official says estimate 10% world's population infected covid.**

The head emergencies World Health Organization said Monday (Oct.5) agency‚Äôs ‚Äúbest estimates‚Äù indicate roughly 1 10 people worldwide may infected population = 7.8 billion

10% 7.8 billion = 780 million

Total number deaths attributed covid = 1.2 million

1.2 million = 0.15% 780 million

Covid IFR (infection fatality rate) 0.15%...probably even less.

According Dr Anthony Fauci seasonal flu ""mortality rate"" 0.1%

‚ÄúThe flu mortality rate 0.1 percent. mortality rate 10 times that. That‚Äôs reason want emphasize stay ahead game preventing this,‚Äù info sourced Fauci. sub truly interested discussing facts covid appreciate comment. simply peddling narrative it'll voted. Completely likely, since viruses able completely eradicate, extent global spread. problem antibodies disappear 8 weeks average makes early exposures impossible trace! Winter. always thought luck. Germany general yes get worse. city Region dark red zone. last weeks bad. Sooo 40 go kind herd immunity! That's good news! /s NY policy put nursing homes?

Why?

*Why?* clearly making 'America great hate this, loved lockdown. hand also means there's something abnormal going Kashgar. Normally single round full population PCR test followed quarantining everyone who's positive close contact enough bring outbreak dead stop. case proving difficult root reason. Well highly contagious largely asymptomatic illness people infectious significant period time prior symptoms, certainty time first case shows there's lot more.  Huh? Fourth?! 4.7 million people!

I wish even 10% testing capacity here. province 13.5 million 20-40k per day, basically taking year cover everyone ONCE. Yeah spreading December Based numbers article, 134,532 Swedes infected. That's 1.35% population (10 millions). mortality rate 4.45% infected cases. achieve immunity 70% infection rate, another 6.8 millions Swedes need infected another 305,ooo people die process. 

Whoever decided herd immunity approach kicked office. bedridden 3 days January. Wife son got sick around time. never get sick like that. Ive wondered along got early. thing makes square texts, pop detail.

*To understand seroprevalence dynamics, conducted retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies weekly intervals beginning February July 2020 using 10,000 plasma samples patients Mount Sinai Hospital NYC. show dynamics seroprevalence ‚Äòurgent care‚Äô (UC) group, enriched COVID-19 cases epidemic, ‚Äòroutine care‚Äô group (RC), closely represents general population.

This got published editing. Nothing article says 20% new Yorkers infected. 10,000+ plasma samples, sure. Unless I'm reading right. used samples people went hospital. representative New York city whole? JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE I'm Australian sicker I'd ever life early January. thought over, started shortness breath. know realistically covid-19 thing contagious spread would noticed, influenza twice life that, much worse that. Made wonder. much US 18 months worth cases. like rest country.  We've 8 months prepare better all. St. Louis, many people take seriously, particularly outlying edges St. Louis County. immediate adjoining counties vehemently protested wearing masks, close restaurants gyms public spaces lock down, allowed team sports accepted kids STLCo teams encouraged playing team sports STLCo communities.  case counts around St. Louis County jumped, local/rural hospitals can't handle high caseload, get sent hospitals St Louis County city.

In county, positivity rate went 4.2% beginning October 9% yesterday. Many schools opened back full time blended model. Restaurants transitioned 25% back 50% more. Group gathering limitations expanded. 

People gotten tired restrained, gotten lax. sort like even 'thing' anymore. everyone reminded yes, still pandemic yes, need take seriously.  we're finding now?

Because collect data math. looked 400,000 women. takes time. makes sense now... died we‚Äôre living Bad Place! Seriously, Vicky? Murder hornets? Similar thing Ontario - got persistent cough December early January suddenly turned nasty pneumonia. dramatic scary, turning blue. took weeks recover (at home) nurses hospital said seeing lot this.

That said, spreading widely back then, seen retrospective studies would establish this? anecdotes worth much since year going quite people got worst pneumonia lives. could tell almost story Reddit bunch people emerge experience. still wonder, also suspect would recognized COVID-19 spreading widely February. lots different bugs could manifest similarly. There's truly asymptomatic get infected, virus still actively working damaging lungs, people, damages minor, cause much symptom, notice immune system eradicated virus. 

Kinda like rare cases, women entire pregnancy, knowing pregnant. Yesterday reddit, stories NL's new cases decreased/have decreasing trend. true then?

I still get random coughs even tho lung pain stopped unexpected adults gathering drinks, parties, etc virus easily spread. important news curfew. high schools finally closed masks mandatory even primary schools middle schools. Creative study. data prove that, that'd great.  Holy fuck guys. They're actually slower Fox. little context.
Around time people got scared chinese communities. One biggest italy near Florence (Prato). Since videos people yelling racial slurs asians started circulating social media mayor Florence started campaign.

What happened Florence barely touched first wave specifically chinese community practically cases.

I tell you, I've seen eyes, month march 10th lockdown could see member chinese community around shops suddenly closed.
And fear attacks (which happen) guess aware others could happen. might concern them, hear ""mercury"" ""aluminum"" get panick attack.
And also strong hate scientific studies, proof ""I heard one young boy got autism vaccine"". Yeh important conscious much treatment improved globally. Around world almost 90,000 covid patients ICU, April global peak 40,000 , yet daily worldwide deaths higher back Hygiene Hypothesis:

Yet another idea study. :-) Nvm, Trump takes WI election, probably restart it. Like miracle Disclaimer: I'm expert, nerd

It depends prevalence whatever condition testing for. rarer condition, higher requirements specificity.

Imagine testing population 1000 patients. 

In first scenario, we'll say **50%** population condition. 98.5% sensitivity 94.2% specificity might get:

* 492 true positives
* 471 true negatives
* 8 false negatives
* 29 false positives

Overall, 521 positive results, 492 genuine. So, get positive result, 492/521 = 94.4% sure condition. called positive predictive value. Similarly, get negative result, 98.3% sure condition. negative predictive value.

In second scenario, we'll say 1% population condition. Now, get:

* 10 true positives
* 933 true negatives
* 0 false negatives
* 57 false positives

In scenario, false positives true positives, simply way people condition it. positive predictive value 14.9%, although negative predictive value (experimentally) 100%.

If 99% population condition, would reversed, we'd get high positive predictive value, low negative predictive value.

Since covid (currently) low prevalence, test would able confirm cases due low positive predictive value. However, convenience high negative predictive value may make useful screening. Agree. Looks like voting tells American wishes. wish knew answer also. Looks like Covid-19 let us know. India 89 fatalities per million population. Asian countries like South Korea, Japan Singapore higher degree hygiene much lower deaths per million population. Thats pretty scientific, yeah. peak called Mount Stupid. he‚Äôs since recovered it‚Äôs totally fine encouraged keep exercising

Facts  Rounding corner...back place. Eradication requires extreme measures (lockdowns), also kill people, lockdowns avoid hundred death (talking European countries) irrational, causes death saves guarantee anything due covid nihilists simply ignoring advice.

That short term thinking, excused hopes vaccine. vaccine would significantly lower R, maybe low enough simple masks 2meters enough eventual eradication.

But assuming vaccines doesnt come year (lets say last phase suddenly finds lethal side effect. Attempt eradication reasonable, nearly impossible, would keep lockdowns every country eradicated, native country - Latvia managed it, New Zeland too, europe Asia would eait Trump got shit together stopped spewing nonsense? Yeah, China Russia okay this. countries well? would ask countries sacrifice economies hundred deaths.

So waiting vaccines widespread, try keeping low, killing people lockdowns worth it.

If R currently 1.1 1.4 ir Europe (heard number somewhere around 2 weeks ago) 50% effective vaccine 50% population would reduce R 0.825 1.05. Basically eradicating current methods.

It's rather like newspapers leading headline, ""Skegness hotter St. Tropez."" Yes, one day, St. Tropez middle cool spell Skegy good weather advantageous temperature difference.

Now Sweden trending higher seven-day average important. Hello swedish herd, you?
I see never stop downvoting numbers like! think effect lockdown like measures? people die flu sometimes, obviously OK intentionally kill lot people covid /s Exactly. Another tool toolbox used conjunction strategies make huge difference. looking numbers measures 2 weeks ago might start helping slowing growth.

But helped like bleeding headache fix headache. long cases grow also hospitals ICU occupancy grow still headed wrong direction. lower pace. tell someone stop talking less dangerous flu, mask work virus used strip rights away ? Asking friend. Finally closing high schools.
In addition areas close part middle schools.
The others wear mask even seated.

Should done schools reopened, now. Can't really give never made effort. Americans significantly dumb, even Canada working kids I've noticed becoming stupid.

Kinda mind blowing. true estimate snapshot time then-current case counts behaviors exhibited. case counts behaviors change, whether better worse, previous estimate obsolete new one needed one exist new current case counts behaviors. virus changes 60% DNA infected cells....

Yeah yeah, rare, mild, normal, reason panic, protect vulnerable, lockdowns hurt people too.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah yeah mandatory wear mask seated? we've come here, public places starting point infection kids adults transmit virus explain get opening schools good idea? 

Cause I'm hard time wrapping head around forcing solution schools reopen. 

Kids need food? Schools open this. 

Kids need education? Schools open this. 

Kids need extra assistance said education? Schools open this.

So kids need school, can't access unless schools open? 

This black white issue, reopening schools far gray area close real solution. People act viruses can't defeated, course becomes self fulfilling prophecy. ""Forced cough"" mentioned. So, little bit evidence kind thing even beginning. whole time we're accused ""panic"". known even asymptomatic people develop lung damage, virus definitely damage pneumonia that, counterparts scream masks mandates, even folks alone home, I'm right you. u read article linked? Didn‚Äôt first vaccine?

/s someone applies approval US let know. . Well yes actually true definitely get odd cough immediately apparent reason cough see suspicious. case, seems implying ""force"" cough make determination that. 19768 new cases 389 new deaths.  isn‚Äôt cough symptom? still operating status - likely open today tomorrow. question distribution time. 

Time - sufficient data vaccines comparatively safely understand market

Distribution - already vaccine? not, enough economic interest import it?

This still business, vaccine prove better, say Beijing one, think AstraZeneca Pfizer allow replace market? us really decide get, hope best available get, obviously chance happens big companies getting properly funded launching version vaccine. curious long-term somehow best market, that's it.  wsws.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I reminded quote Martin Sustrik's article ""more ever wanted know Swiss political system"":
""It turns Switzerland ruled anyone particular.""
A radically unled political system based slow bubbling consensus awesome dealing issues change much year year. 
It is, conversely, absolutely horrible coming terms new problems. likely woefully undercounted. People often unable see doctor get tested. People dying home without tested. It‚Äôs bad guarantee Trump (or Biden) involved science behind makes vaccine safe not. kind statement many conservatives don‚Äôt believe climate change, confusing science politics Eradication even plausible many asymptomatic carriers. disease us on. medical treatment produces predictable, reliable consistent results, everyone watch ""every little thing do"".  waiting issue minks reservoirs.

Denmark comes close though. 361k tests performed asymptomatic people last week (5.8m population). physically able immediately tour WH?  Probably won‚Äôt attract much attention think right wing nut jobs pretty much given holding Swedish model something recommended. quieter guys front. guess anyways. long lag reporting, deaths showing corresponding growth cases. 150% increase weekly week 42 43 (Late October).  Week 43 may end higher increase, late reported deaths added. think term ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù refers immunity use vaccines (or term originally used). 

Regardless, trying achieve ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù used, would result millions dying possibly living detrimental long term effects. fail see would desired course action. ""Just two weeks""  know (I've read thread while) ;)

Lmfao you‚Äôre like every single thread translating us figures like it‚Äôs metric imperial something find ridiculous, want offend anybody, people believe urgency precise data clearly totally missing big picture: asymptomatic cases identified EU matter testing capacity tracking system.

This even true people make comparisons first wave testing even limited, treatments different, HC systems failed.

But yes, itself, Michael Ryan's back envelop calculation 10% word far caught virus, people estimate IFR flu, 0.14%.

Aside accuracy Micheal Ryan's estimate, there's issue counting deaths countries enough testing, others transparent. There's researchers counting death toll using satellite imagery. 

Finally, western countries highest IFR due higher proportion elderly. Ioannidis' global average IFR 0.2% 0.3%, true, may overly reassuring 9% world's population 65, 15% US \~20% Europe years, IFR increase proportionately. I'm sorry Denmark go this.

/s Frankly, do.

Why staffing discussed ""issue"" first wave? much higher numbers higher hospitalizations talk hospitals ""running staff"".

Now 7 months later benifit hindsight. 7 months prepare. instead ""numbers"" concentrated cities, much spread out.

But somehow running staff *right beginning* this?

Seems odd, right?

But ... told, shouldnt expect see hospitalization numbers going up. no. hear terrible outbreak city, might actually see *plenty empty hospital beds* statistics now!

But shouldnt allow fooled!

Because ""staff shortage"", cannot see gain insight into, causing empty beds.

But somehow *not* issue first wave?

I find interesting. said deaths trending downward. Clearly not.

And yes, hogwash. presence co-morbidities change fact people would lived much longer lives gotten Covid.

Also, I'm dude. nation's metric, would red one start year. Gotta figure monetize course think got it? late. 

Europe basically totally open summer months, restrictions lots people going vacation. Coronavirus almost non existent Europe summer months. fun summer, pay price this. Europe fell asleep truly believed threat basically gone... clearly wasn't. Convenient timing announcement, no?  anyone done unbiased study find contagious COVID-19 is? R less one needed disease eventually stop spreading. R-effective much spreads people trying prevent spreading. much spreads people everything normally would do.

There lot lockdowns precautions taken try get R-effective less one. Yet COVID-19 still spreads R-effective greater one. government officials claim COVID-19 contagious common flu yet less contagious Measles, that's R-basic range 0.9 18. seeing still spreading comparing Measles outbreaks, I'd guess COVID-19 contagious Chickenpox yet less contagious Measles, that's R-basic range 10 18. Yep, like Rapture/Apocalypse we‚Äôre always hearing about.

Jfc can't believe comments saying fine kids right now. seriously can't wait another year? Wtf. wtf. slew vaccines ending phase three trials, China already begun mass inoculations theirs. Every indication virus mutate rapidly like flu therefore eradicated least heavily suppressed via public vaccination. 

Still lot work get billions doses out. possible solution horizon, make sense make every effort control spread longer? 

I willing emulate citizens Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, others controlled virus successfully, least vaccine chance. insufficient controlling virus, yes, need adapt sustainable measures, get used thing around, like flu.

If eradication proves tenable, countries keep infection rates near zero, going enviable position. Same! little flu, problems. /s ones work. surface transmission rare still something consider 2 billion year? take 5 10 years? Nah comparable government sort care people.

Scientific consensus suggests IFR 0.5-1%. know Canada, US hospitals trouble acquiring even non-N95 masks earlier months. recall read advisory, buy masks beginning told hospitals need them. least Washington state, hospitals asked public donate unopened N95 surgical masks PPE. Gosh feel like goalpost moved ...that‚Äôs true okay. complete agreement, think. really responding use 'frantically'. agree casting light. us prone complications others, take extra steps safe. make anyone frantic, implying someone frantically anything discouraging way phrase it. really. IFR determined estimation number cases vs. deaths. widespread flu vaccinations, fewer cases. However, cases, whether thousand, hundred million, expect fairly consistent % infected population die. things would okay ppl wore masks beginning. point ppl refused bare minimum keep others safe. it‚Äôs absolute disgrace. droplets breathe go straight line- MOUTH! Things breathe in? Random air around- tell hell someone breathe droplets breathe out? TELL THAT! wrong you?! that's pretty much case since covid became thing... making news? Fuck yes beautiful badass. Kick stupid virus teeth show who's boss.  PPE alcohol. I've dreading moment &amp; flu season since May. I'm like whatever... hit got. Still standing. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  Oh, forgot /s. saw post American, listing scientists knowledgeable people Canadian government, implying things much better Canada US. 


I like ""meh... things bad US Canada look like heaven..."" post almost made forget lies, fuck-ups betrayals Trudeau government.  false. vaccine passes phase 3 trials surely fit purpose though? Thanks, that‚Äôs super interesting last serology saw Sweden (their numbers, long ago) 10-20% range country-wide. way they're near herd immunity, though ""advantage"" (paid lives obviously) cushioning blow come winter. absolute bullshit. ""‚ÄòIt rolled proven safe effective robust clinical trials approved medicines regulator MHRA.

‚ÄòOnce approved, NHS stands ready begin vaccination programme risk, rolled widely.‚Äô""

But vaccine going approved ?...

AFAIK Oxford vaccine rolling review start October.  Agree, didn‚Äôt happen everywhere year. hope states change make mail-in voting thing. It‚Äôs safe easy! Bill Gates!  Copy pasta CDC conforming 70%.

What‚Äôs also scary women 35-44 4x likely die younger women. 

From CDC Study

‚ÄúCompared nonpregnant women, pregnant women frequently admitted ICU (10.5 versus 3.9 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 3.0; 95% CI = 2.6‚Äì3.4), received invasive ventilation (2.9 versus 1.1 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.2‚Äì3.8) received ECMO (0.7 versus 0.3 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5‚Äì4.0). Thirty-four deaths (1.5 per 1,000 cases) reported among 23,434 symptomatic pregnant women, 447 (1.2 per 1,000 cases) reported among 386,028 nonpregnant women, reflecting 70% increased risk death associated pregnancy (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2‚Äì2.4). increased risk severe disease related pregnancy apparent nearly stratified analyses, pregnant women aged 35‚Äì44 years COVID-19 nearly four times likely require invasive ventilation twice likely die nonpregnant women age. love idea. run office?  wrong tho. plain wrong. Public perception publicly seeing higher rates mask wearing self feeding cycle people wear masks often see people wearing masks often. helped China outcompete United States.I guess lesson story lying bad, even used attack opponent. Sorry. thought sarcastic asthmatic wear mask. What's DOI? logical think arguments wrong.  actually decent arguments based science. Oh get completely, I‚Äôm tired fighting misinformation. 1) use discretionary funds buy every N95 every hardware store country, contract retailers buy future shipments, 2) tell public truth this, encourage wear best masks make find. everything make home relaxing place her.

And stockpile PPE. Yes, we're breaking sorts records noted elsewhere, March 3 [Jeremy ago. Tsunami. Christmas New Years. Unfortunately true, money power give people confidence don‚Äôt deserve can‚Äôt actually cope with. Yeah, know intellectually. would nice everyone would get vaccinated. least loved ones get it... that‚Äôs good get guess. individual risk low, group risk high. wife statistically totally fine‚Äîbut also know many people be. It‚Äôs hard comprehend mentally. Good luck stay safe. get this. like saying good thing ""only"" two towers fell 9/11. development clear sign hundreds thousands additional people could well die. Belgiums healthcare collapsing smh. positive peters turn anything smile instead facing reality. hard say, oh no, bad sign future? rather worrying indication state Eu healthcare, still very, early wave. could convenient British Government though - announcement new national lockdown mis-managed weekend coming intense scrutiny... saying lockdown continue December followed rollout vaccine starting week would take lot pressure PM... But. But... economy much good. conspiracy theorists want hear anything conspiracies. Also Ottawa! 

I can‚Äôt wait Saturday! ""Colloquially, people experiencing bias said ""on Mount Stupid""""... medical term? make less piece shit this. find ridiculous we‚Äôre sending kids germy schools daycares, women labor alone partner/advocate support them.

Edit: Oh, don‚Äôt forget allowing people germy planes completely unnecessary travel! people? like single digit number tens millions? inside house problem inside friends house problem?

Yes. That's works. spreads vicinity someone new might covid. isolated there's vector. Thanks. sounds really smart. implication vaccines? vaccines aiming triggering immune system response? trigger autoimmune antibody attack instead? possible? I'm medical expert. wait, saying covid could America December 2019? NYC Xmas worst flu life week. doc didn‚Äôt say flu, worst sore throat fatigue. bedridden week. hope wasn‚Äôt it? depends meant central.

Clearly virus came another part world, England continental Europe countries predict pandemic result failed plan accordingly measures quarantining foreign travelers, sort thing.

As result virus spread much farther wider Europe China. Given situation, obvious thing countries United States would seen virus imported far Europe China?

So, Europe, origin virus quite clearly central global spread. 0.1% IFR flu also likely bullshit. CDC data 0.1% fatality rate measured SYMPTOMATIC influenza infections, sure sounds like CFR me. I'm sure everyone keeps claiming that's influenza IFR. makes sense D: Yes, it‚Äôs exactly works. Evidence...the fucking data. play words using one Trump‚Äôs memorable pronouncements Covid.

‚ÄòOne day ‚Äî it‚Äôs like miracle ‚Äî disappear‚Äô: Trump said pandemic thank post, It‚Äôs sad could have, didn‚Äôt, contain like SARS MERS. wife pregnant, post great see. Cheers fella! Either way, people started get reinfections, wouldn‚Äôt count previously infected New Yorkers guaranteed immune, especially worst relatively early on. symptoms now, seems likely not. early tell anything since less year. counter one points Singaporean regarding vitamin deficiency. people stay indoors day Singapore unbearably hot go outdoors either early morning late evening. I'm sure quite lot people vitamin deficiency Singapore. agree rest points. real head scratcher, read headline read voted tonight. federal law disobeying flight actually know flu, got tested flu strep. negative. But, since ""classic"" symptoms known early March, told get Covid test likely sore throat. Except course doctor explain headache, scratchy eyes, insane blood pressure, crazy high heart rate ""just sore throat"" caused ever. losing antibodies mean losing immunity. That‚Äôs works Trump said one hear Nov 4th. 

Insanity. state plan. Smart states different priorities (and therefore plans) depending vaccine(s) approved; states half-ass use plan regardless vaccine.

First priority going healthcare workers first responders, doses almost certainly administered work. priority depend specific vaccine inclinations state government.

Its likely need two doses, 3-4 weeks apart (depends vaccine).

Remember first vaccines approved preventative! Approval criteria vaccines works half people get it. people works in, vaccine needs lower infectivity rate, reduce severity symptoms, reduce death rate.

Improved vaccines come along knowledge increases. so, think vaccine matter? Study: Stadlbauer, Jessica Tan, Kaijun Jiang, Matthew M. Hernandez, Shelcie Fabre, Fatima Amanat, Catherine Teo, Guha Asthagiri Arunkumar, Meagan McMahon, Christina Capuano, Kathryn Twyman, Jeffrey Jhang, Michael D. Nowak, Viviana Simon, Emilia Mia Sordillo, Harm van Bakel, Florian Krammer. Repeated cross-sectional sero-monitoring SARS-CoV-2 New York City. Nature, 2020; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-2912-6 

Received: 12 July 2020, Published online: 3 November 2020... really, people's immune system's overreaction fighting COVID ends killing them. Perhaps sufficient immune systems could keep wraps.  number infected positivity rate pretty low (for some, like Rwanda) though, really depend much age.

I think talking deaths thread. worry long term complications never symptoms? unpredictability absolutely adds danger it, needs able spread mild symptoms many people, killing others phenomenal. It‚Äôs starting seem like something we‚Äôll dealing year year. hope America gets President actually thinks coronavirus problem. No, latest numbers 0.1 0.4 based around 700 million infections. article thread explain forced cough. need rewatch Forrest Gump premise mind... noted first lockdown generally successful Australia, second wave state Victoria largely overseas arrivals badly managed whilst quarantine. Statically no, rare.

WHO puts estimated global population infected point 10%. That's 700 million people roughly vast majority asymptomatic.

It also kinda shoots number story foot predicted IFR closer 0.1 0.4%. agree, disaster government. They've done things well. 

But, whole, utilising indicators really matter: understatement say failed.

Although helped lot people country took notice whatsoever basic, simple guidelines. That's weird. Netherlands, Belgium, France talking taking patients Germany, can't find anything suggesting Denmark is. Here's official statistic 169 hospitalized now, close triage levels. weaker strain stayed China stronger strains got exported ... could planned better. understand Chinese ready lock everything based imported strains. It‚Äôs start.
But we‚Äôll never know got it. terms England reasons hit hard wrap umbrella capable: politicians people. pretty simple obvious going happen back July things opened again, scientist even look data trends see coming: virus contained still there, things opened again, people social distancing. ever one outcome. lot people scratching heads wondering happened we're position.

It's opinion Europeans superior happened virus reinforces view. Calculating mortality rate tough depends sample size. state lot old people living cold weather without VitD (N Italy) going different young population warmer climate (Nigeria).

In Germany, think estimated rate 0.4% around population whole. also relies healthcare system collapsing. you‚Äôd look 1%. decade least. Smart answer, many companies miss mark Southwest could get away something simple. (Looking you, United) government countries telling us deadly coronavirus 

one minister said. another 40-50% go get even close herd immunity. That's kind opposite novel viruses tend work, except part ""it disappear"", that's true often not. become less deadly less virulent time massive artificial immunization occurs. become seasonal major worry. hand, initially effectively entirely contained, would like SARS MERS epidemics people even know happened affect anybody all. Cool? meant flu? Come on, name virus. Come on... *virus* causes severe lung damage. Blood clots, syncytial lung cells. work healthcare? There's way hell would let someone's spo2 hover 80s heated high flow nasal cannula BiPAP. pao2 goals (arterial o2 levels directly blood) goals 55% *ventilators*. ok we're sedating letting machine work closely monitor lung compliance gas exchange. O2 levels patients, also monitor kidney lung function (pH level, CO2, bicarb) blood gases. There's much saying. lot severe covid patients end continuous dialysis I've dozens ECMO. NH. sick late February. wasn‚Äôt flu... eyeball-melting fever 4 days, dry cough, works. miserable. plague spreading didn‚Äôt occur could that. point I‚Äôm likely get again...  I'm going like CDC make claims recant. proper response would knows new virus learning about. really wasn‚Äôt point describing environment...
That‚Äôs obviously perfect super spreader event. No, said media ignore shit Biden. Cmon, either bait plain strawmanning. I've read far they're saying covid going away, non stop reporting it, equally silly. always thought would ironic flu tart China China actually advanced ones detected first. predictions big joke. pandemic first broke proclaimed would never reach Sweden. somehow odds did, claimed hit peak around 15-20 cases. guy also said bears responsibility job, that‚Äôs boss. :) Well either way, never got sick, good using hand sanitizer whenever saw even pandemic maybe effect? dunno, life crazy. even casuality rates aside, shown spreads way easier flu strains.

I wonder concerns may truth become seasonal virus. expect preventable vaccine (mostly) building resistance time make less deadly, effectively making seasonal disease stuff one worry much about.

I guess difference flu longer ability collapse hospitals, social norms, entire economies. mean wear mask social distance, maybe?  know 5 new babies since March happy healthy! Ugh I‚Äôm shocked. lungs haven‚Äôt ever recovered doubt they‚Äôll ever fully functional like again. S/o girlfriend (and supporting her!) helping people like during/before this‚ù§Ô∏è Bet downvoters crying eyes right damn people haul poor oxygenation mind fog months, die, worse common cold. really Interesting virus, bad way guess. Okay thank you, haha. Living LA County, al know huge population travelling China, Chinese Citizens here. January 2020 husband, in-laws got sick weird ""cold"". recovered. convinced Covid spooking around probably November 2019. want make decisions yourself, move desert island lighthouse something.

You live society. People acting WANTED intubate people like mad. People always think vent = oxygen. They're thinking happens mental status get tired breathing 50s/60s days. many people got unlucky AF ended ECMO severe ARDS. I'm *still* taking care covid patients ICUs. Antibodies don‚Äôt last forever. February could fully susceptible now. sub, yes. one nothing offer. wanted compare Scandinavia Denmark Norway available. Adding Finland Iceland would us comparing vs Nordic countries.

Yes, EU experiencing surge currently. :) :D He‚Äôs personal trainer... able breathe exercise properly made think it‚Äôs kill lazy ass sure. don‚Äôt know it, got tested last week first time aren‚Äôt feeling great negative.. girlfriend works NYC hospital day said they're seeing lot recovered covid patients coming infections neurological issues. Scary stuff Smart people already knew beginning yes, need science make fact. Good job scientists.üôè Humanity together. okay, chill recharge, thanks Also, conventional science giving antibodies 3 month shelf life possible virus November. long term impact quality life scares me. Scars heal, scars what's left healing complete. They're good going get. I've certainly got enough speak experience one, idea inside chest matching outside genuinely freaks out. try breathe that...

If nothing else, going make lung transplants hella difficult future. Lots demand, much lower supply. Antibodies last while. [NJ tested positive covid antibodies believes sick virus Nov, 2019. Check  
  
it talks covid possible origins. strain found Wuhan predominantly ""older"" strain. Soo around .0000027%. Okay Canadian, feel way time. many Canadians checked mentally lazy comes Canadian issues, things happen US could never happen here. arrogant assumption everything actually super fine we're messed US. attitude predict one day really surprise Canadians can't complacent anymore. hate people ever have. think ptsd watching many people die. know do. New Yorker here... Back early March wife runny nose headache 3 days. Tested positive COVID. Never broke fever. Expected die, never turned bad.

I'm confused, kid home Christmas, got sick early Feb, got Ohio Mid-Feb. Christmas Feb, 2 month incubation period? ""NHS""? might overflow nursing homes.  Unemployment deadlier antibody tests April!? I‚Äôd add Finland list. Iceland surge cases, well rest Europe. Well opposite good talking point going around certain circles herd immunity low 20% 

Obviously case. fact Sen. Paul insisted 20% Fauci shot hearing. good times

to werewolf suppose hot sauce, confirm felt sensation couldnt taste it. sure you‚Äôre downvoted. Curious Obviously nobody exact answer anyone inform im almost possibly ? anxiety would appreciate it.

Tomorrow Marks day 9 covid positive. fever days 2 3 Thats gone since then, since ive fatigue cough. breathing problems, ive slight chest discomfort cough feel usually bad coughing fit. still cant taste smell lot congestion cleared today breathe nostrils. feel like ID feel normal didnt cough. know people turn bad window thats worries most. Damn people downplay saying they're young healthy, affect them. RNA sterile tube EXTREMELY stable. problem lab idea RNA unstable whole world filled digestive enzymes (RNases) literally make disappear seconds, package inhibitors right solution fine. 10 times deadlier flu dont segregate data age, healthy young people china virus 2 times deadlier, makes wonder lockdowns made determinated parts population exposed damage. There's ton assumptions associated that. First whether estimate 700 million infections actually accurate, two, number confirmed deaths worldwide undercounted.

IFR fluctuates wildly around globe, CDC one estimates IFR US around 0.7% average across ages. entire US population bad sample size. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go away weather gets warm.‚Äù 90% still antibodies around seven months, going 0% eight months it? largely asymptomatic true?
I read 15-20% asymptomatic, large number? Happy anniversary  wonderful president made clear he‚Äôs OK 1% population dying everyone inevitably contracts it. Ya dun goofed USA. forgot specifics test since came back negative, there's couple theories would really fit:
A) coronavirus
B) mutated form coronavirus

Of course vague 0.02 2% 0.02%?

Even used ""estimate"" 700 million get 0.16%. Yeah think resistance would help much anyways appears one strain. guess would peace mind, would pretty far list priorities given cost antibody test... money birth rate dropping future death rate keeping pace.  Lol So, makes stop people coughing sneezing onto around surfaces? mean 116 cases asymptomatic infections detected Xinjiang? Two points clarification.

On evening November 3, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government Information Office held eighth press conference report prevention control latest new coronary pneumonia epidemic Shufu Aktau counties.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe meeting reported November 2, 24:00 3, 20:30, two new confirmed cases Kashgar region, asymptomatic infected referred confirmed; new asymptomatic infected 116 cases, receiving isolation medical observation personnel, associated Shufu County Station Min Township.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhy many new asymptomatic infections one day?

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThree rounds full nucleic acid testing 11 days.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe high number new asymptomatic infections first associated intensive full-team nucleic acid testing. Oct. 24 Nov. 3, Xinjiang's Kashgar region completed three rounds full-team nucleic acid testing 11 days, described veritable ""due diligence"".

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn first round nucleic acid testing, 183 positive cases detected.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn October 24, Xinjiang Kashgar region Shufu County ""should checked checked"" personnel regular testing, found case new coronary pneumonia asymptomatic infection. Nucleic acid testing staff began night. October 27, Kashgar region completed first round nucleic acid testing staff, except 183 people Shufu County, negative.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOf 183 positives first round nucleic acid testing Kashgar region, 137 asymptomatic infections Shufu County associated first asymptomatic infections Three Village factory parents asymptomatic infections located (reported 25th); also 26 asymptomatic infections, close contacts 25-day asymptomatic infections; October 27, five confirmed cases referral asymptomatic infections.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSecond round nucleic acid testing, another positive test one place

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄA second round full nucleic acid testing carried Kashgar since October 29. October 31, second round nucleic acid testing complete, 51 confirmed cases (all asymptomatic infections referred), 222 asymptomatic infections, Shufu County Aktau County.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt noteworthy October 31 15 cases asymptomatic infections also detected Aktau County Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, adjacent Shufu County Kashgar region, addition Shufu County.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThird round nucleic acid testing, completed three days

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn evening November 1, third round full nucleic acid testing launched Kashgar. day, three new cases new coronary pneumonia confirmed (two asymptomatic infections referred) six new cases asymptomatic infections reported; November 2, 13 new cases asymptomatic infections reported.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn November 3, third round full nucleic acid testing completed, 116 people found positive day, negative, associated sparsely populated Station Min Township.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAs 20:30 November 3, 64 confirmed cases 330 asymptomatic infections Kashgar. Together 15 existing asymptomatic infections Kashgar, Xinjiang 64 confirmed cases 345 asymptomatic infections.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn words, three rounds full nucleic acid testing 11 days, total 409 positive cases detected. reported November 4, Kashgar region carry another fourth round full nucleic acid testing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIncubation period new coronavirus varies

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn addition intensive testing, pattern transmission new coronavirus reason large number asymptomatic infections.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAccording relevant person charge CDC Kashgar, incubation period neo-crown pneumonia 1 14 days, common incubation period 3 7 days, means 90% people test positive nucleic acid third seventh day infection virus, others less 3 days 7 days.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn addition, time exposure infectious agent varies person person, well individual differences, time nucleic acid turn positive varies widely, still within incubation period. Nucleic acid testing ""gold standard"" confirming infection asymptomatic individuals apparent clinical symptoms incubation period.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSince time lag infection detection virus, previous nucleic acid sample falls within time interval, may detected. Therefore, need increase intensity frequency nucleic acid testing. Intensive nucleic acid testing, shortest time accurate identification screening still latent infected, early treatment, early recovery time, also prevent spread epidemic.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt noteworthy present, asymptomatic infected persons reported Shufu County Kashgar County Xinjiang screened found among persons isolated medical observation.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe large number asymptomatic infected persons found among centralized isolated observers intensive all-staff testing shows prevention control ahead epidemic's development. cutting-edge research. Sure wish known months ago... I‚Äôm sure would even matter now... seems resistance doesn‚Äôt seem last long. here. Ended hospital. Skipped Christmas new years protect others. never tested flu COVID antibody test, mom's came back negative. sick time much persistent cough. know long got antibody test. Something...something... George Carlin MIT university, business. Source? How's there's clause compensating airline damages. Smoke cigarette get 10k fine. Endanger 100s people - get money back. Care share source contradicts says ?  ‚ÄúJust small flu‚Äù Try cinnamon powder. tastes nothing release nose. Here's date piece cells antibody production. Padres @ Long Beach? US breaking records record breaking pace. I'm suggesting said sure ever it. Antibody test way find out, far know. US blast Good lord. Thank you, wishing well. Please take care. Praying get finally. Shazam it. 

Imagine downloading Shazam identify song voice bad result come positive. N...o??? Masks don‚Äôt prevent people touching faces mouths touching things. Unless people randomly lick surfaces way stop mask. know comment might get purged. must say upvote. matter time they're done testing butthole spiders they're unleashed upon us all.

So still get worse!! Serious question. 

How surface get contaminated? People wearing mask? need sinister explanations.

BLT.20.265892
By John P Ioannidis

This man literary review case mortality rate found 0.23% high side. 

Influenza yearly estimated case mortality rate 0.13% - ish allowed go numbers posted love proven wrong, honestly, peer-reviewed research WHO?

Edit: well guess I'm wrong article keeps analysis localized within New York.

Edit2: also pretty bad news outlet include link research. name co-author I‚Äôm sorry hear that. Stay safe look loved ones. Republicans: it‚Äôs Flu Facts hysterical! What, 80% infected? Bruh don‚Äôt even primary care physician right now. fact tested alone miracle. single sustained outbreak occurred outside China January. people documented gotten via travel December one November, none passed anything on. enough people likely person one them, would've dealing long time were. CDC pegged IFR 0.70%, report claims 0.97%, far off. discrepancy could explained limited representativity demographic NYC, alternatively underestimated infection levels.

I could find actual research paper link, assuming preprint, best. Done. Good luck project!  Interestingly, sense smell responsible 80% taste. Without smell limited sweet, salty, sour, bitter, etc. 

Try - hold nose closed fingers start eating something flavour (eg chocolate) mainly taste sweetness - release nose whilst you‚Äôre still eating get hit chocolate flavour. Great trick need eat something don‚Äôt like taste - hold nose you‚Äôre done washed down. :) Get antibody test instead two people France November.

Almost people severe respiratory illness November, December, January it. talking tiny handfuls. people spark outbreaks none circulating illness February March descended them. Ditto! Even without unblinding though, know total average infection rate/hospitalisation rate local area total average rates trial group (vaccine plus placebo). rates trial group less overall, reasonable assume due vaccine half getting less sick like last flu 100 years ago, Spanish flu. actually come start Spain, first recognize take seriously. Everyone else head sand. downvoting someone posts wrong information.

This person posted cited information. +5 social credit points comrad live China people sorts issues Nov/Dec makes sense. speculated first (literal first) cases could started late Oct means lots time start making rounds. Add fact Chinese government spent least 1 month acting like exist (likely build supplies make plan looked good) ended today.

Just plopping comment wrote elsewhere.

Nov seems plausable depending travel around (and travel) live China people sorts issues Nov/Dec makes sense. speculated first (literal first) cases could started late Oct means lots time start making rounds. Add fact Chinese government spent least 1 month acting like exist (likely build supplies make plan looked good) ended today. typed lot bullshit wrong. Scientific consensus suggests IFR 0.5-1%.

No doesn't. puts 0.02 significant portion global population. Thats academic publishing nutshell... Well remember people DIED covid. people got severe infection. worst case scenario. sorry. permanent damage athletes 30-40's real. I'm 40. Major loss lung function cardiac pacing issues.
Edit: rescuing ppe much. appreciate service ICU. fortunate work outpatient right now. feel sorry friends intubate ppl working 140 hrs week. ""study"" 100% bullshit goes current studies.

All current IFRs put right line bad seasonal flu. help half deniers thinking sort conspiracy Thank speaking sense. Maybe fucknut dick bag get it. unlikely get seriously ill, spread family members. Exactly. Fucking idiots man. God people stupid, it‚Äôs fucking infuriating could literally die every time turn oven microwave.

You could literally die every time take bath shower.

You could literally die every time fell asleep.

You could literally die every time drank much water once.

You could literally die every time you... list goes on... on... on... on... on... mean ravaged entire city wuhan well anywhere else, nothing advanced detection No, medical community actually admiring people likely December Reread comment. dramatic fuck saying it‚Äôs frequent occurrence? No.

Again, go right ahead tell parents dead fucking kids Rona killing was, ‚ÄúCould (happen), likely tho.‚Äù statistical fact, honestly  Well New York hadn‚Äôt hit yet  love this. Amazing, truly amazing. Reread comment, since comprehension skills clearly lacking. pull, ‚Äú20-30 year olds frequently *dying* (FTFY) this...‚Äù comment? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. Because, well, far know, considering I‚Äôm looking unedited original comment type shit, never said it‚Äôs frequent occurrence. fact matter is, shit happens, teenagers, young people, kids, babies, yeah fucking die disease, like old fucks do. 

That comparison ridiculous well. Let‚Äôs take look basic statistics, get idea stupid is. 

Official CDC data, easy fuck access, telling lightning shit decided bring up. look, perfect. index showing number deaths per age group, official! Yay! USA! Oh ofc, wonderful comprehensive guide almost purely statistics, worldwide, Rona. 

Guess what? original comment, yeah, still stands. Tell that, ‚ÄúCould, likely tho‚Äù shit thousands parents across globe dead fucking children, thousands husbands/wives/parents/grandparents/children whose loved ones, parents, spouses, etc... fucking dead. numbers article, 134,532 Swedes infected.

No. 134 532 Swedes *currently* *detectable* antibodies *didn't get false 1.35% population (10 millions).

Wow! thought virus supposed extremely mortality rate 4.45% infected cases.

That's CFR, achieve immunity 70% infection rate, another 6.8 millions Swedes need infected another 305,ooo people die process. 

If math correct, isn't, would still take 30 years unfold. Every single day work it‚Äôs like people testing positive symptoms. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Two people yesterday symptoms. large work environment.

In Netherlands right test symptoms unless get sick won‚Äôt know I‚Äôve it.

A weeks ago went period would get attacks felt like couldn‚Äôt breathe lungs felt super tight. thought anxiety, wasn‚Äôt sick otherwise came attack, I‚Äôm much stress it‚Äôs happening anymore. brother doctor said could already. 

I hope so. üò¨ mean, course has? that's whole reason ""who cares numbers now, scaled testing system place barely know even spot it?""

If came somewhere got here, elsewhere OTHERWISE long think wearing masks? trying debate, curious since child (with sensory issues) likes one kind disposable mask, many buy. always stock. bought enough 6 months . saying March almost year? airlines suck anyway. ‚òë DILLIGAF almost local transmission, Singapore continues adopt strict measures like mandatory masking, group size limits (5 increasing 8 Phase 3), contact tracing, travel restrictions, quarantine, etc. measures allowed shopping malls (often packed), schools workplace open life almost back normal. thinking thing I'm sorry offended you. making observation.

Can agree disagree thing? probably got January February people's accounts getting really sick officially announced.

He failed us many ways. paid lot companies make PPE actually make much came it.

He removed oversight Covid relief payments right distributed.

Though touts ban travel China, someone rerouted flight another country, good.

A lot Chinese manufacturers using method get around tariffs, too.

He sucks much. thinking John Ioannidis' paper, WHO. new paper published hosted website. affiliated statement WHO.

In paper, peer reviewed, suggested current IFR decreased due better medical care, IFR somewhere 0% 1.2%, gives low average 0.2% 0.3%.

John skeptic lockdowns disappointed colleagues optimistic projections. example, March predicted paper based Diamond Princess, 10,000 deaths US, interview Journeyman pictures, said outbreak would gone unnoticed year except there's test detect virus. One interviews removed YouTube inaccurate claims. 

He also author deeply flawed Santa Clara antibody study claimed IFR virus hardly worse flu, 0.12% 0.2% (more people New York City died upper estimate). study used test licensed accurate enough positives claim found (they could false positives). also random sample. advertised participants paid shopping vouchers. Indeed, wife one authors emailed school advertising test, time RT-PCR tests rationed, telling people could find virus immune. 

I saw advert Reddit, took test told got tested wanted find illness due COVID-19, obviously biasing result. 

And two authors paper wrote op-ed Wall Street Journals day paper published talking study, claiming showed virus much less lethal feared lockdowns necessary. disclose connection study (the article updated information later on). 

Furthermore, source funding study initially disclosed, later discovered lot funding came owner Jetblue airlines, David Neeleman.

Finally, corrected paper published end April, buried statistics admission number positive results could Zero. even not, selection bias remains.

All all, sad see John Ioannidis, one World's top epidemiology experts, play seriousness pandemic cosy people economic interests portraying virus relatively harmless.

Basically three weeks cluster identification effective public health responses started. might possible novel pneumonia cluster identified week 29 Dec, looking one. real world, patients scattered across multiple hospitals, perfect responses happen. 12 days first death total lockdown city bad, real world. See lethargic Western responses mostly been.

Unfortunately, lunar new year holiday celebrated 17 Jan, many returned Wuhan cities, passing fever check, 23 Jan. 

Meanwhile, New Zealand banned entry foreigner travelling via China 2 Feb, 16 Mar extended mandatory 14 day quarantine incoming travelers. 19 Mar NZ banned entry non-residents. extreme poverty. can't tell rhetorical question not, case here's wikipedia page read it.

Not rhetorical, perhaps poorly stated. understand definitionally specificity means, practically know 83.2% considered good number? percentages low specificity starts undermine usefulness detection? obviously Americans love it! simply peddling narrative it'll voted.

I downvoted simply condescending attitude. think US difficult opinion without political. know, live there, observation.
In Holland bit nuanced feel. guess kinda fits category want squeeze in. 
Facebook starting big influence well. good one. Filled out! Best luck project! needed ! Germany, 50 % ICU ventilated; delay last moment. 50 % ventilated die. Buddy that‚Äôs not.... specific instance isn‚Äôt worth idiotic mandate. CoViD HeRe. Article states meant used diagnosis, rather idea asymptomatic cases able discern need isolate get tested. Like, sometimes cough start feeling anxious asking *why* coughed wondering sick. can't haul jail without law, make pay lotsa money stupidity terms conditions. They're lashing modernity.  Bad China real created fake virus fast tracking real vaccine one worry fake cases. July 9th? ""What, saying nobody ever die locked forever. People die lockdown. I'd rather live life. people calling lockdowns simply hate freedoms."" pretty much point (though elaborated elsewhere more). Super early versions even known data them. confirmed sewage remnants Italy December, wasn‚Äôt known several months (wastewater samples saved). Politics definitely understand. care economy haha example Danish health department 28 january:

[It expected number infected China increase new cases also seen countries. However, still relatively few, predominantly imported cases outside China. new case Germany change assessment probability disease coming Denmark Here, dropped this

/s Can't believe people really think shit exists. would cough asymptomatic? Well even 99% accurate test produce 50% false results 1% catches. simple mind assuming that's extremely largely margin error new test comes another CCP stooge ""Every move make, every breath take"", affect spread Antibody test would likely test neg far out. there. Don‚Äôt waste $. Got exposed Jan 9, first symptoms 19th, wound ER July 19, Yep, still issues. Finally got things sorted enough start feeling better. hindu nationalism scary Scarring lungs expected severe pneumonia, people freak selves much like unexpected effect. Lose smell/taste, dry cough (barely runny noses), sore throat. fianc√© ended pneumonia. Dunno diarrhea though co-workers fianc√© symptom. said ‚Äúworst cold lives‚Äù hung weeks, remember mid-January coworkers talking ‚Äústill getting awful cold‚Äù. still felt like shit days. science many us got tested flu tested negative... it‚Äôs literally massive outlier ignored. Herd immunity reached, mission accomplished. would explain currently seeing huge increases hospitalizations deaths, saw spring.

If assume currently Sweden catching, say, 50 % virus cases, spring 5-10%, one expect less deaths compared spring.

Deaths still come (assuming virus changed) relative real infections, confirmed infections. course includes assumption virus spreads age groups. Amount confirmed infections is, sense, artificial flawed measure may may picture reality well. 35 million people age 65 sub-Saharan Africa, roughly German- French-speaking countries Europe.

Anyways, pretty certain China cover Africa next year. No. genetic risk factor [recently also absent countries, excluding Singapore mixed population. 

In South Asia present ~30%. 
Europe ~16%. Japan much higher life expectancy much lower fatality rate though. symptoms have? early genome samples. possible earliest versions virus less infectious bubbled around Wuhan low level longer know key mutation declining vitamin levels blew up. fianc√©, coworkers sick last November/December symptoms listed ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù doctors told typical flu didn‚Äôt know was. Yes, agree completely! Common mindset, common enough! like provoked answer actually read article üòä Ha ha thanks, edited  trouble studies like this, largely depend households among risks risk-taking behavior necessary adults allowed/required government. 

It always good report absolute risk various exposure vectors rank probability. think unethical irresponsible say potential vector important many likely ones. Depending specific lifestyle mitigations, item list going ""most risky"" you. 

You may 1st, 2rd, 5th items list possible threats; making 3rd listed *your* biggest risk--even 50% population/community risk first second routinely. 

If going public time, drinking, going gyms, restaurants, wearing masks, etc... kids school increase risk much, one person bringing home (probably one higher risk vectors) likely infect others.

If **not** things, working home, distanced deliveries, visiting family, etc. starting sending child school *may* *become* highest risk activity household. house mitigated every factor thinks sending kids school safe, forced local government, *is* increasing risk themselves, child, household.

In case; get COVID, possible vector mitigations would physical contact items delivered (particularly grocery items decontaminated isopropanol taken inside can't sit garage 3-5 days.) lower risk activity compared many others; *only possible* exposure activity given lifestyle mitigations. months security footage prove possible vector. typical study participant, risks typical study participant representative lifestyle mitigation strategies.

Just households getting infected way sooner, mean children cannot bring COVID home, spread others (and community at-risk housemates.) Children get COVID spread COVID, often fewer symptoms less testing (some parents intentionally withholding testing avoid forced quarantines/school closures). children become seriously ill die. exposed school. exposed parents activities--essential nonsensical (but risky).

Similarly unprotected vaginal intercourse (especially men) lower risk HIV transmission sharing IV drug use anal sex; higher risk activities, *is* highest risk individuals. lower-frequency vector ultimately cause individuals become infected infect others. Done. ccps mods upvoted post. people get face acne (I do) that‚Äôs pretty rare also easily treatable creams. also use co-pay assistance program get free. talking RNA specifically. exact formulation might unstable yes doctor noticed ordered tell - defied government whistleblowed. one first died.

Maybe get herd immunity time. not, always third time. UN ranks Swedens elderlycare number one world comes quality life also straff per elderly.

Staff, otherwise somewhat amusing Swedish.. one's telling stop keep sitting ass indoors prefer so, feel free rest world moves time came across 0,4% mind gymnastics paper Streeck Wodarg high-flyers called study.

Still quite laughable math, bit better Positive rate still high, something weird numbers. test symptomatic cases now? meantime I‚Äôll keep shooting bleach;)

In seriousness, health insurance first time 6 years I‚Äôm psyched find derm woohoo!! I‚Äôll bring do. Herd stupidity, however... hope close schools Germany too. wide open public transport packed. exactly. actually better compare like like, terms economic growth, wealth, similar life expectancies. Japan similar Sweden Africa. know comparing apples oranges, using example demonstrate vaccines lot complicated clever dead-bug-goes-here Germany schools open ten times children infected holidays. numbers small matter. look 7-day average instead see Sweden passed Denmark: [ourworldindata.com - gets data - take data directly national authorities believe - difference even greater: SE 26,3/100.000 vs. DK 18,3/100.000




Compared Denmark Sweden has:

- 1/4 amount tests per capita
- 4x share positive tests
- 2x many hospitalised
- 4x many ICU
- 1/2 many deaths per day apparently. Considering rest data likely due Sweden‚Äôs [well known registering and/or reporting death.
- estimated R value 1,69 compared Denmark‚Äôs 1,1 yesterday. course explains Sweden speeding past Denmark. test symptomatic cases, Belgium Czechia. I¬¥m surprised closing Gyms, cinemas theatres nighttime curfew bars restaurants help. half measures don¬¥t work, didn¬¥t work single bit Germany. yay singer I'm terrified. True, im saying anything else scoring high healthcare doesnt automatically mean less deaths corona.

If really care low covid deaths offer high quality life elderly (as freedom/active life) definately high life expectancy.

Also Italy lot elderly hasnt positive comes coronadeaths. opposite true large parts Africa, low life expectancy helps stop coronadeaths. problem! Find either derm asthma/allergy doc get prescribed. don‚Äôt think doctors going make connection solid 2-3 years since research slow. Herd immunity possible without millions dying US alone. better? Germany schools kindergarden still open. Thank you! skin issues too, maybe kill two birds here. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre ok!! go away weather gets warm.‚Äù

and cold warm vaccine finally released widely enough GLOBALLY. ""The balance keeping virus control keeping important social, economic spaces open delicate one,"" Tam told Current's Matt Galloway.

I read yesterday well another article, eradication goal.

They can't dumb, they? Please say so.

You aim eradication, i.e. robust R&lt;&lt;1, via continuously improving TTI, hygiene measures contact restrictions.
With better tests perhaps even vaccines, replace measures.

If robust, get Covid rollercoaster wrecking society.
If R&lt;&lt;1, get lockdown lockdown.
If R=1 like Germany summer, get lockdown autumn. Watch Korea. They'll get wrecked sooner later.

You simply can't control system high uncertainty, latency degree unpredictability like wan't do.

The stupidity mind-boggling, mathematically, also leadership.  Pls stop believing covid, ill last year...it annoying plenty diseases around cause troubles...
if redditors comment section would representative world, seems 90% world covid last year ‚Äûhad sickness hit like truck covid!!11‚Äú Eastern developed countries referring to? Melbourne-Sydney travel reopening later month give economy boost. I'm sure. strange watch apathy. think people focusing lower death rate. Unfortunately leave find complications. people thinking travel restrictions going magically disappear? really wonder people spin goes full-blown control state. probably got NYC wave 2.

Risks lung transplants whole issue, yes, long term solutions generally drugs therapy come in, extend life quality. Amateurs cases reported day complete day combination cases previous day + one that. Seems Monday less confirmed cases last week's average - 1500 (1100 already reported yesterday) + 2800 cases yesterday. yesterday complete leftover cases tomorrow already single day 4000 confirmed cases last week. average still 3000 though (and hope stays below). swede read threads great entertainment value. 

Thumbs people actually try stop misinformation specially u/atealein. 

I simply care bunch foreigners internet say. good saying ""Sk√∂t dig sj√§lv och skit andra"" Oh my, makes think that? can't serious, honey... article says exactly Charina12 saying. antibody levels drop 3 months, memory fight stays. 

If exposed body able build antibodies much faster. likely even get symptoms stop virus multiply. 20%. Thats 1 every 5. could 80% time. kidding. even thought actually; first world countries double-shot vaccines logistical annoyance.

For third world countries places torn war instability, they'll lucky get one shot all.

This vaccine bit late game compared candidates, boy crucial. recommendation using masks? ignorant shows misinformed population. Unsure getting downvoted. clear actually advocating vaccine sold outrageous prices, optimistic vaccine working want soon feasible. deaths line current rate progression InB4:

- herd immunity coming along?
- second wave yet?
- Tegnell fired?
- lockdow?
- Hurd IMmUNTY StarTtAGUH!
- much Morphine per pension√§r? agree would make sense general always better detail going regional/area level.
Because course easy imagine first wave hit new york nashville. milan palermo. madrid Alicante. Sweden higher US now: 3198 cases equal 104,574 US cases--Sweden's trending 2544 cases per day lately, today start playing poo huh? cases went 15k 5k. wondering new rules reason decrease daily infections. Oh ok.. thank Oh okay, got.my timeline mixed up. while. Thanks correction. always needs noted Wednesdays day cross-checks done death registry deaths usually higher days. last Wednesday nine reported deaths clearly headed wrong direction. add:

Today Sweden registered 3198 new cases 28 deaths. 

Denmark registered 936 cases 1 death. 


So 2x many cases per capita (with 1/4 tests) 28x deaths today, though latter likely representative general level. pretty clear going - Denmark level 10 days now, Sweden seeing exponential increase. 

I honestly worried Sweden general particular family friends there. around early spreading widely Toronto (extremely international population) would fucked like New York was. Please feel free correct me, I'm health care professional. understanding lung transplants long term solution anything related lung failure. increases lifetime patient 1-2 years. Mass, needless deaths, neglect science denying!! Votes in.... WANT MOAR. ‚ÄòSneeze friend day‚Äô coming soon Briefings Tuesday Thursday, number updates Tuesday Friday.

Lol taking education even know expression ""let alone"" ""little lone"" yikes  Sadly, consensus seems [about three based samples taken 10,000 people visited hospital. Considering ton people get COVID display symptoms, I'm sure large population accounted study. basically theorized 20% people visited doctor COVID. lot people routinely visit doctor. NYC locked state? infected much.  call bullshit early numbers. something early January left without sense smell, fever, difficulty breathing lasting month. I'm healthy 30 year old small-tourist town Mexico. Several family also showed symptoms around time.

Especially 3rd world counties, question would expect ever know much certainty people seem express.

How long Chinese doctors think normal pneumonia presenting older patients finally decided something going on? long enough doctors saw one decided get genetic testing done? long actually gets recognized something novel? long study confirmed? even start thinking politics it. Even given estimated first diagnosed case October personally expect would spreading relatively unnoticed months prior. people usually avoiding hospitals, one does, hospitals 100% trusted. I‚Äôve never heard theory government doesn‚Äôt use taxes fund spending.

Herd immunity already proven thing. reports numbers like 30,000+ dead Wuhan, know verified ever got. I‚Äôve heard several stories past weeks people denied downplay virus (or loved ones) get infected.

According latest Health Ministry report, total nine regions registered occupancy ICUs 35%, considered upper limit

Emilio de Benito

Madrid - 04 nov 2020 - 10:14 CET

A third Spain‚Äôs intensive care unit (ICU) beds occupied coronavirus patients, according latest report pandemic supplied Tuesday Health Ministry. total, 2,754 people receiving intensive care treatment Covid-19, 104 Monday, 531 admissions discharges. Since pandemic took hold March, total 15,898 patients needed ICU treatment coronavirus.

This indicator key trigger Spain‚Äôs regions ramp coronavirus measures, given ICUs difficult set improvised basis availability immediate effect mortality rate. nine regions latest report shows occupancy 35%, considered upper limit: Arag√≥n (48%), Asturias (38%), Castilla Le√≥n (39%), Catalonia (42%), Ceuta (47%), Madrid (38%), Melilla (57%), Navarre (40%) La Rioja (57%).

A total 238 fatalities notified 24 hours prior publication Tuesday‚Äôs report, 832 seven-day period

Hospitalizations also high, 16.24% beds occupied Covid patients. According Fernando Sim√≥n, director Health Ministry‚Äôs Coordination Center Health Alerts (CCAES), means ‚Äúin hospitals, programmed activity suspended, good news.‚Äù

The regions Arag√≥n, Asturias Castilla Le√≥n, well North African cities Ceuta Melilla, compromised, percentages 20%. importance indicator reflected fact regions requested tougher coronavirus measures. Currently, nearly 20,000 people hospitalized Spain due Covid-19.

In terms fatalities, total 238 notified 24 hours prior publication report, 832 seven-day period. means rate 100 daily Covid-19 deaths holding steady, parameter not, now, increasing speed number hospitalizations ICU admissions, first data points reflect rise cases. official coronavirus death toll Spain stands 36,495.

While epidemic continues advance country, signs change trend. example, number new cases continues high, coming 18,669 Tuesday‚Äôs report, far record set Friday 25,595. Yesterday‚Äôs data broke four-day run rising figures, counting Monday‚Äôs new cases given include Friday, Saturday Sunday. total, 1,259,366 positive cases officially confirmed Spain since health crisis began.

The 14-day cumulative number coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants also fallen six regions: Arag√≥n (1,119), Canarias (73), Castilla Le√≥n (820.2), Madrid (373.7), Navarre (1,182) La Rioja (764). Monday‚Äôs report, data point fell Canary Islands, Madrid Valencia region.

Focussing improvement Madrid‚Äôs figures, Fernando Sim√≥n Tuesday night pointed region example restrictions implemented ‚Äì including perimetral lockdowns entire region individual healthcare areas ‚Äì effect flattening curve. September 29, region registered 784.71 cumulative coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants 14 days. October 16, number fallen 500, although controversy changes made region terms reduction number tests carried out. 15 days that, number dropped 400. Sim√≥n also used result bolster Health Ministry‚Äôs current position full lockdown similar one implemented March currently necessary. I‚Äôm sure people realize could important news virus far. Watch things like closely, especially winter.

The one thing I‚Äôve keeping eye since February mutations, watching various trackers following scientists. 99% mutations don‚Äôt change anything regarding making virus better worse.

However... mutation worse changes game completely every level - treatments possible vaccines.

Pay close attention - main stream media - find direct sources follow stay weeks ahead.

If much dangerous strain emerges country origin fully immediately lockdown... idiots, well... hopefully you‚Äôve kept educated understand means may need do. well :-( idea are. Well, least we'll two month head start work Covid-20... So...coats going cheap? /s

This awful. Poor minks. Maybe stop treating animals like plants? Jfc. focusing treatments time. can't prevent it, least fight try prevent deaths way. Using [CEBM updated calculator shows IFR estimate, excluding samples deaths 500, gives 0.4% IFR estimate. Using samples gives 0.35%.

edit: Europe. probably travel bans quarantine periods place ... good thing already do? many people remember ME? 15-17 million killed farmed millions Europe fur. [Harrison's Principles Internal said 15-17 million don‚Äôt think cats found infect humans. Humans rarely infect cats. Yeah, stated TV put 15-17 million minks. idea many. Oh no, kittens. Danish government going announce restrictions (likely kind travel restruction) regions Mink farms tomorrow. enough....nobody knows. it.......this rational explanation üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ spreading among humans, respond COVID-19 antibodies. may facing COVID-20 COVID-19 over.

*Maybe* get one control, Denmark addresses directly instead trying cover initially like China did. Infection fatality rate COVID-19 inferred seroprevalence data John P Ioannidis Wait thought culling mass, due demand legitimately arguing cat life human life? 
Are joking? can't tell. Hopefully new strain minks react current covid antibodies actually contained... Fuck. Mink-farm workers catching Covid animals back September, already spread, least Europe. Happens let virus infect 10s millions people. German, state 2.5 Million (!) minks Denmark alone killed this: Omg Yup. remember got suddenly sick xmas. well co workers. knew one two people usually get sick around time year( winter). every one? 

I still think covid NY way march. may proof work noticed. suddenly got sick. Fear little-death brings 
total obliteration.
I face fear. also lot less people symptoms allowed tested. Possibly another reason? Autumn holiday? Um, wtf mink? Looks like started couple weeks first part correct. Instead waves, US, called ""ratchet clicks"" (since levels keep ratcheting higher). say 20% towards end article say, ""It apparent virus continues spread despite finding one 10 New Yorkers may already infected."" saying 20%, 10%? government issued kill-all orders mink farms Denmark. 17 million mink killed fast possible. affected regions go back full lockdown There‚Äôs 15-17 million mink Danish mink farms, roughly 3 times human population country. Start treating animals better would lot less bullshit.

Or leave fuck alone... covid 19 went humans minks, mutated (most likely enough new virus) jumped back. It‚Äôs covid 20. Think like flu case. Exactly! infuriates me! Last weekend one busiest weekends time. People went shopping even though absolutely crowded. lockdown started sunday monday 00h00, monday evening said able see results already. test less means actual numbers going down. eat Minks

edited come too....edgelordy

apologies dicksucker today.... ""They laughed us refuse poo loo. Who's laughing now?"" Record rises becoming unsurprising here, really. last weeks we've reporting record numbers borderline daily. Well, made long journey Milan Minsk... got March, still high antibody levels. get tested time convalescent plasma donation Mt Sinai every week. wife March, antibodies gone mid September. there's quite bit variation. Oh know dealing with. discussing herd immunity, already clear immunity short lived. waiting vaccine end all, knew vaccine-resistant mutants inevitable. extinguished (almost), mostly free scenarios. back normal going headache thing 2025-onwards. Covid-Vista

[We're going Hi!

 
So spent Saturday (24.10) friend suddenly developed symptoms Sunday (25.10). tested positive following day. I've mild cough runny nose Wednesday-Thursday that's it. (28-29.10). PCR test first day mild symptoms (28.10) turned positive. never fever anything severe. 


It's 11 days since got infected 7 days since positive test. Given symptoms, ok go play football match Sunday (8.11)? would 15 days got infected 11 days since positive test. Roughly 10 days since mild symptoms stopped. 


My wife says would early feel completely fine quite time we've isolating...? Wonder cats minks, animals infect. human bat transmission?


Would hate become transmittable mice, rats, humans. here's video appears paramedics getting positive results antigen test apple juice. Thanks this! netherlands gassed 2.6 million minks corona.

&amp;#x200B;

link dutch Yeah worked wonderful Covid-19 found Corona mutation named cluster 5, 12 people far. Parts Denmark going lockdown. 
The change seen spike protein virus. wish people understood serious virus is. remind everyone know regular basis matter 30 even younger, worth taking gamble on. Always many fucking minks yall pets lol. Sorry, forgot check, correct, weasel family already human population. going prevent spreading rest world? That's true. since still many unknowns really unhelpful.

* might it
* Reinfection possible
* could mutate (although antibodies might ""should"" protect small mutations)

So nearly cautious us yet. Well that's rather terrifying. Word family private clinics wait two weeks get into. maybe quicker, still quick.   Possible, sure. Also possible got whole new set tools infection didn‚Äôt lose goddamn thing. Don‚Äôt bargain it, keep eyes it. little confused this. saying covid19 went humans, minks -in mutated significantly, able jump back humans mutated form?

yes  long think pandemic last? Knowing Spanish flu lasted 2 half years lethal virus (and less science knowledge tech) Covid-19 mutated amongst rodents, re-infected humans mutated form covid-19. press conference now, done tests covid-19 anti-bodies respond well new virus.. 

So yeah, fuck Love this! exactly since Jan year. +1 know time we're allowed send anyone anywhere we're sure gonna sending best :) Yes.  I'm Swedish, could see Tegnell mostly responded outside claims strategy utter madness based ""herd immunity"" voluntarily killing elderly sake GDP bullshit like that. generally myth Sweden adopting super outlandish strategy radically different from, say, Norway's Swedes happily going around infecting other. way slow. Denmark main player Genuinely dumbest thing I've heard day watched Trump's speech live. Belgium counting covid victims. doubt US honest. Seems 2020 wants go bang Note: selected flair ''World'' government authorities claimed new thread whole world. 

Translation (16.14 CET +1):

All Danish mink must killed.

This Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S) says press conference.

\- virus mutated mink, mutated virus spread humans.

Corona observed today 207 mink farms.

\- mutated virus among mink may involve risk upcoming vaccine work should, says Prime Minister.

\- risk effect worst case occur. could devastating consequences pandemic entire world. mutated virus risk spreading countries.

According SSI, several people North Jutland infected mink, virus changed much bomb vaccine development.

According Danish Veterinary Food Administration, 1,137 mink herds registered Denmark, approximately 12 million mink.

Updated fine Sure killed flu countries I‚Äôm little confused this. saying covid19 went humans, minks -in mutated significantly, able jump back humans mutated form? 

Or separate, different coronavirus found mink may jump humans? first read ""mutated coronavirus Minsk""... Thank you! try that, although still work home, stress unavoidable, lol. mink shit wack anybody else lol ? Covid-20. Woe us. back guy 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

there [ONE HUNDRED vaccines works. 

This first one Washington University School Medicine St. Louis developed vaccine targets SARS-CoV-2 virus, given one dose via nose effective preventing infection mice susceptible novel coronavirus. **The investigators next plan test vaccine nonhuman primates humans see safe effective preventing COVID-19 infection.**

&amp;#x200B;

The study available online journal *Cell*.

Unlike COVID-19 vaccines development, one delivered via nose, often initial site infection. new study, researchers found nasal delivery route created strong immune response throughout body, particularly effective nose respiratory tract, preventing infection taking hold body

&amp;#x200B;

Although influenza vaccine called FluMist delivered nose, uses weakened form live influenza virus can't administered certain groups, including whose immune systems compromised illnesses cancer, HIV diabetes. contrast, new COVID-19 intranasal vaccine study use live virus capable replication, presumably making safer. hand france pointing might 100k daily cases.

So would equate million cases 10 days 8.4 million cases 12 weeks. would slightly less 13% population.

If assume France ten times cases reported total, would 15 million cases, around 22% population. Given numbers, France showing signs herd immunity.

It seem way, it? People stopped using airships expensive slow 

Steamships reliable airplanes faster think Asia mink. beleve el paso really area texas really bad..what hell happeend there? Yes, am. It‚Äôs already 40x deadly flu. suggesting time horizon flu ultimately kill people people immune covid? mean, sure, could work like nobody knows.  know covid killed 40x number people year flu, 25x state perfectly capable running healthcare system. None changes said. Yes amusing literally video photo evidence well first hand evidence doctors. doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdepend believe‚Äù Lmao Omg. news overshadowed bad sign considering start fall. V N C E E E C N case rate looks awful Well that's said.

That french study 6 days ago.
Similar claims done see countries cases growing exponentially anymore. that's mild restrictions place while, limited testing capacity something else cannot tell. trying look video end year mentally perceived closed door something. probably noodles head that. That‚Äôs point, made assumption. opinion, like fear, isn‚Äôt something counterpoint. article, read it, covers that. Thanks proving point, lol. time grow up, little baby coward Muh Freedoms entered chat gonna happen.

one wants lady's money, regardless consequences flyers. Nobody eating mink correct. practically avoided first wave quick lockdown - locked schools early whole country soon after.

But around 12k unexplained excess deaths top that. likely undercount deaths large margin. Especially recently since hospitals overwhelmed enough tests (it verg hard get tested amd regions report huge delays getting results). reddit, didn‚Äôt hear northeast governors literally nothing wrong? tried make appointment online? one two weeks ago Kitchener. Booked 4pm 11am next day. Results 36h. excess testing capacity  It‚Äôs obvious. need mink human population. mean remains active fecal matter general mink poop? People keep trying hammer away idea groceries safe day handle. I'm willing accept risk personally know people general disgusting. Poop kinds things people touch. Thank Denmark citizen world right thing. happened different country, country may hidden problem refused suffer economic damage. Thank you. breeding diseases livestock may ultimate answer. clear picture? old antigen tests, early days completely faulty. Hopefully use modern ones like Slovakia - pretty good. 99% animals factory farmed stop buying products made animals that‚Äôs great start like isnt genocide? know animals..but mean humans, animals wife little bit overweight, diabetic, high blood pressure...and yesterday tested positive. got sick Saturday night, Sunday, we've sick since. doctor gave Zinc, Vitamins C D3, Aspirin, Melatonin prescription...and said really nothing else watch wait. video doctor (no insurance) told take things, also called TamiFlu...though calling doctor back today same, said useless take. Anyway, felt pretty bad since Monday, today feels yesterday, tightness chest today. else do? drugs taking? Native American medical system great, tend prescribe certain things...so wondering anything might get private doctor doing. Would covet help offer...sigh. Thank Fuck seagulls, got time cocksuckers. Downloading game want become Jupiter much dangerous strain emerges country origin fully immediately lockdown... idiots, well...

Biggest scare right seem like Denmark locking fast enough wide enough list competently handling virus. So.... probably. Fuck. get this.


If you‚Äôre familiar *Butterfly Effect*, know **the earlier act, greater effect future.** *Example:* get bad grades first year undergrad, it‚Äôs much harder get college 3.5. 


Similarly, virus spread weeks, maybe even months China. Usually happens local annual epidemics: **The country outbreak contacts WHO/UN *immediately* assistance &amp; cooperates whatever recommend.**


CCP every chance say something, didn‚Äôt. every chance something. waited least one month, maybe longer, first cases *anything*. **They objectively spent weeks trying hide it. fact. criminal.**


It **one week after** CCP locked people homes **Trump stopped flights to-and-from China, time called racist/xenophobic** everyone left.


Then everything shut down, like everyone wanted. economy tanked, fault...for doing...*exactly everyone wanted.* 


Then everyone wanted go back work. states started opened up...and cases started going up...*and that‚Äôs also Trump‚Äôs fault.*


Look. recognize wasn‚Äôt technically 100% honest. think kept mouth shut lot situations. He‚Äôs asshole. He‚Äôs scientist. However, personally I‚Äôm glad misled me. I‚Äôm convinced downplaying **how long solution would take** reason economy didn‚Äôt crash immediately. Imagine came TV said ‚Äú*We might locked situation couple years*.‚Äù


**Everything would collapsed. People cannot digest information.** Instead, we‚Äôve limped along month-to-month. Now, we‚Äôre almost year along. lot damage done, there‚Äôs nothing anyone could‚Äôve done (*short intense lockdown start, like said.*)


But severe ten week lockdown tactic makes sense now; would laughed back March didn‚Äôt know know now.


Either way, anyone deny China mostly fault pandemic shame. 12 first people know YET, numbers already sounds much higher That's COVID-20. Next COVID-21. hope stop third. Denmark place mink fur production... Specificity inverse false positive rate. stress vaccine effectiveness assumes spreads rate covid. Learn2read little broski Well mayor Jaws still mayor Jaws 2, people stupid. 2020 please end already? 35% positivity rate. Damnnnnnn... Build fucking wall around village/part country let anyone unless they're 100% clear. Give provisions supplies need Denmark fucks they're going responsible 100,000's deaths. Yah true, fact CDC said doesnt affect young people huge reason spread much. frustrating people acting like over, reasons Western people want comply simple mask requirements social distancing months Jesus Christ. going push species extinction levels? destined die anyway too, farms for. world always ending. question fast. sure handle deadlier covid trump presidency. given choice i'll take covid. It‚Äôs appointment people symptoms. first wave upped capacity said anyone get tested summer. idea made switch symptoms only. Let's fucking gooooooo Life life. Need work? call unhappy. people worse am. higher hopes country. mink industry barbaric never existed first place. poor animals. Poor minks. That's sad. deserve farms let alone culled humans can't get shit together. important question is: severe effects?

There many types coronavirus dangerous. chance sounding extreme: Stop farming animals!

We probably wouldn‚Äôt even flu wasn‚Äôt farming animals!

Livestock become absolute liability! Go Taiwan üáπüáº get break.. dude going Southpark episode, sigh Nah dude I'm still eating meat fucking sounds like Plague Inc. upset far pandemic, even mutations taken place still idiots believe real, still debating facemasks. depressing. Lol obviously achieved herd immunity, 20% make difference talking marginal changes reproduction rate: city A, 5% immunity rate, R 1.05 new infections previous one, city B, 20% immunity, it'll 0.88, virus decreasing. Even though important factor, impact reproduction rate. like one cares scientific details anyone.

I, one, scraping bottom barrel fucks give hanging thread keep going. wish ignorant bad things really are, maybe I'd enjoy life bit longer. Thank learned lot wanted write proximity weakest country real threat. late.

EDIT:
They mink farm infection, word strain. God remember life. used manage store we'd take $200K/mo 30% profit margin company owner would change commissions calculated dick salespeople additional $100/mo.

Good luck you, hope works you. Assuming they‚Äôve done time... downvotes honestly could devastating news we‚Äôve covid yet. spreads there‚Äôs going essentially covid-20 requiring completely new vaccine treatment. needs transmit one mink one human back problem population 8,57 million reference. little, late. done 2020. Fur sure reported here, promedmail, May 25th, check link Nature article - quote - ""So far, two reported cases animals ‚Äî mink ‚Äî passing virus SARS-CoV-2 people. mink links probably spreading Europe already. Eh, someone make open-source driver lungs eventually Respect prediction, lol really good. unfortunately, needs two sentences max, know, enough brain RAM such.

I tried, failed two virus jumps animals easily. change come back. get sick worse before. great example preventing spread human population important. viral spread = opportunities dangerous mutations. 

Kudos Denmark taking economic hit prevent spread human population. Please, enlighten point made supposed counterpoint lol. I‚Äôll wait, moron 12 people confirmed infected mutation. Hopefully contained.

EDIT: word credible source? familiar Denmark media. Well essentially $ business owners. owner store owns 23 others. paperwork mine, makes unhealthy amount money. Easily I'd ever make lifetime one store. argue employees 50 dollar Christmas bonus. knew due COVID-20  excess testing capacity Ontario. People aren‚Äôt going get tested. would hope that‚Äôs don‚Äôt think COVID. Keep crying funny. u think u win argument 0 counterpoints evidence far never saw Minkpocalypse coming. 2020 keeps coming sure, 100x less deadly can't fun recombination popular strain? I'm worried they'll fail, already smells like incompetence. 

Definitely i'm worried we'll fail. Locking *tomorrow*? Wtf? translated right, cut middle part stating ""There's observed corona 207 minkfarms around Jutland. SSI found examples five different farms across 12 people, virus mutated somewhat resist antibodies"" - essentially reiterating effect current vaccines might helpful spreads wildly. disease found birds bird foot, small study. 

The hypothesis birds carry shit one farm next. Yeah, we've mad cow, swine flu diseases bolstered keeping animals close quarters awful conditions, we've seen enough diseases propogate way. Seriously, need put stop industries force animals live conditions especially something unneccesary fur certain amount urgency behind makes seem like WAY WAY worse 'its minks it'. probably active mutation sometime, probably spreading humans months. (lets hope not) Plenty colder climates Denmark manage without fur faux fur.  DON‚ÄôT NEED COUNTER POINT LITTLE BOY. 

You made point besides afraid information, pointed out. Loser solution? Nationwide lockdown? (Which btw possible legally) humans animals suffer due stupidity handful stupid selfish people wet market... :( Fuck shit going start learning Chinese tonight. I‚Äòm done whole pandemic, want out. didn‚Äôt mean... but... üò£ Daddy Birx joke. chance doctors supposed do. medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good Denmark sounding alarm early taking drastic steps immediately, unlike so-called world hegemon. sequenced 12 individuals - extrapolating estimate 4.5% infected individuals Northern Jutland new strain/variant. 


New restrictions announced tomorrow affected region. Shhh shhh bby ok, flu... animals kill potential reservoirs leave? Alright re-read comment chain, replacing mink jew

edit: joke guys neither man :/ North Jutland are. bc discuss spreading capabilities Ok, makes sense. well. Europe getting thrashed, we're quite ok comparison. Remindme! 3 months honestly thought fashion didn‚Äôt exist. Google bubble guess. Uh, seems like result, less life lived wasted resources, no, better way. Deaths going increase another week, like spring case peaks. hoping you‚Äôd actually absorb time see covers question keep saying won‚Äôt answer. One started point counterpoint lol. you‚Äôre truly idiot lol mink weren‚Äôt raised pets. going killed anyway. won‚Äôt know difference ‚Äúkilled due covid‚Äù ‚Äúkilled fur.‚Äù sad killed due covid, tell something truly feel killed all. Maybe long run practice killing mink fur end, involuntary sacrifice animals won‚Äôt vain. Sputnik V released months ago. covid scary enough already people exposed outbreak found, could mutated strain realistically eradicated point? I'm trying find information can't read danish. wonder mutations arrive feral cat populations? Maybe feline AIDs humans contract like cold asymptomatic carriers. almost like SARs taken seriously... Anytime there's species jump, really fucking bad. immunities brand new viruses creatures, would wave 3 covid. Possibly killing millions. Glad got fast. ""Just"" ..

This *really* sucks. disgusting. poor animals. virus like ""The Thing"" Multiple covid contact tracing apps rolled free charge. press MIT rolled app free charge would result compensation instead charging fee it.

Huge surge donations, huge academic research win. said rare event? knew could infect cats since January. 

The virus uses ace2 receptors infect. virus extremely transmissible. That's need. Dude article literally added new info meh, always say someone rather humane (much) worse animals. skinning creature make nice coat candidate. else seagulls travel? Perhaps concerned mink-poo footed seagulls walking around Germany, Poland, France, UK etc. No, I'm saying first documented case reverse zoonoses human mink back humans May 25, 2020. order species jumps, necessary virus mutate - spikes receptors slightly different shapes (see articles posted) Human ACE2 receptors different Mink ACE2 receptors. 83% same, according figure 2 article mutation (11 mutated residues) would required make jump due difference. question - MUCH mutation happened genes virus well, (is gain function?) wild mustelids might also now. many mink farm escapes years... bad play, I'll say. CO2 emissions taking nice dip boot. elaborate implications? add another 2 years lockdown work create TWO vaccines diseases notoriously difficult time consuming create vaccines for? 2021 getting ready see. Schools opening + cold + low immunity = virus goes viral Let's hope best case scenario plays out. far hasn't. Women working kids school less issue. think women never work. 5 no. Either dad mom home. Daycares good development age. kids older parents working kids socialize school that's bit different. mean people work kids babies toddlers also miss much. childcare provider tell took thier first steps daycare (it's actually discussed) time openly admit kid terrible day unless sick. nothing wrong wanting traditional family least children young.

Also, I'm sure great (nurse,doctor) chose one ...someone else would job. one else step child's mom. holy shit Portugal jump today, 3927 cases, equal 126,842 US cases, Czechia reported 7300 cases, 226,300 US equivalent, Italy 30,550, 168,025 US equivalent Hah, yes, Greenpeace finally enough chaining things. Time get biological! That's even said Wait getting new restrictions again?  let virus out

WHO

WHO

WHO Fist bump that, bro! Please, no. Let keep deceiving delightful delusion, 2020 bad cause it‚Äôs leap year 2021 better. many times going banging head desk year. implications terrifying. seems like pretty big overreaction. shitstorm starts, Denmark's hands clean cleanish... guess goal avoid blame Masks must worn standing moving around groups publically accessible indoor areas. Including schools. talking about? Allergies, colds, reactions dust air, asthma, etc.  Tons reasons people cough related Covid Baby troll lol. Can‚Äôt admit lost. child mentality, really feel bad you‚Äôre actually adult lol. Wow, would shame Millions livestock culled Europe stop foot mouth disease 2001. Remember well Ireland. sad seeing farmers affected like video below.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMOx7OKPM8s&amp;t=8m40s said it. there. late point silly things like ""context"". emerged USA instead could way worse. Changes nothing mean, third time close first two, else going do? Thank reply. lot company's working nra based vaccine opinion dangerous alteration DNA. stop entertaining dude kind funny I'm bored studying virus active weeks? Can't remove fur hazmats? Lockdowns horrible mental health economy, letting virus run loose far worse consequences, hospitals already filling can't keep going else medical services restricted covid patients.  negligence me. 

You absolutely right.  
People negligent self centered throughout whole pandemic led us here.  


It ducking boils blood doctors nurses working day night dying everyday (YES LOST NURSES ENTIRETY WWI) audacity call Negligent. Nope, cases like get incinerated safety. new episode, called ""Pandemic Special"" guy you, thinks TV = real life. 

No wonder USA handling pandemic badly. Besides terrible leadership.

The claim virus went bat pangolins something China pushing since January. Read [article ignorant troll fucking called start pandemic. happens meets wild populations transitions back domestic. never free virus point. survive wild still able infect humans. bodies health comes first. body good it'll unlock potential fight millions pathogens like throughout evolutionary lifetime.

Disrupt microbiome immunity gets weaker. Great...just great.

Guess give hope semblence normalcy even vaccines prove effective.

Can't wait start dating come 2034! could human, spatchcocked it!

I napkin maths, reasonable model unknown pile meat'n'bones known pile mean'n'bones purposes dimensional analysis Ok what‚Äôs title? There‚Äôs nothing providing evidence 10x deadly claim. Denmark 15-17m minks compare Started wet markets, mutated fur farms. Swine flu, bird flu BSE came factory farming. learn leave animals fuck alone? Gave couple times now. can‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre child. Lol. baby troll lol Yeah, fuck noisy aggressive shitbirds. putting would tricky, they're everywhere they're numerous. mean rat birds. Pretty sure they're still going use fur Also production faux fur (plastic) terrible environment. Oil also renewable resource. Synthetic fibers aren‚Äôt ethical option everyone thinks are. planet earth‚Äôs way telling us rent due oh come fuck  farmed mink wild mink. literally dumbest argument ever seen shithole website lmao COVID-20 Lol. Literally talking child here. Go back school little boy Shit. Call News 2020. didn‚Äôt shut I‚Äôm still waiting counterpoint dude Minks assholes, Mink industry unpopular problematic Minks know, businesses mink live Denmark side virus, since mink farms still illegal. Ah yes entire world mobilised massive economic quality life consequences non existent disease Nothing illegal, going private testing lab. 

Getting treated get really sick corona different problem, almost private clinics allowed deal infectious diseases, still going overcrowded state hospital even money (at best pay like 2-bed room TV instead 6-bed one without) It‚Äôs almost systematic exploitation animals grows spreads dangerous pathogens... that, maybe...

We shouldn‚Äôt anymore. since cannot guarantee it, wear mask.

It causing harm wear, could potentially cause great harm wear.

There simply reason selfish wear one. Look. You‚Äôre still wrong ignorant it. proves child lol. don‚Äôt anything worthwhile say shut down, cry like baby lol  PM, would used opportunity lock entire country again. said, know tough decision make call, development would much ""this needs die cradle"" moment.  live Denmark absolutely agree. Shut us completely, every possible way. went Covid-19 humans minks countries Denmark Netherlands via seagulls? country‚Äòs minks got first? literally wuhan January. honest we've years without issue. problem coronavirus lack plan ""well good luck buybye"" Keep crying bro mean still hoping immunity help us cope this. mean strategy nothing hope getting ASAP. think message Sweden early need measures live long time? saying worked well, believe honest well-meaning strategy.
Do think pressrelease Mars says ""herd immunity strategy""? sure essence strategy.... state handles disposal mink, farmers.

And no, Denmark least corrupt public workers world, think they'll try sell it.

Because Denmark tried prevent spread policy striking every farm five mile radius finding corona one farm instead destroying 0.7% exports could possibly contained. first two points done already. That‚Äôs Dr. Birx traveling state make sure reporting done correctly. Back March Trump mobilize Defense Production Act increase production ventilators PPEs emergency. Going forward don‚Äôt think PPE federally managed, unless want state health officials jobs become obsolete. WRT tracing, would mean federal government know every citizen went? don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs constitutional  Don‚Äôt kill them, burn them, it‚Äôs cool Right? want giant mutated super rona mink spreading across world. hope fucking wins. Mink lives matter might European equivalent would. hire US Police forces, love shooting living things. work dance studio pretty high sanitation measures usually (95%) time alone front desk. boss teaches rooms usually near me. received call last night stating scratchy throat chalking usual sinus infection gets around time (allergies Texas). decided call today due fact could possibly COVID I'm choosing stay away her. I've already COVID (back mid July) live high risk parent thankfully pass contracted it. trying hardest get again. feel guilty calling I? studio Thursdays (tomorrow) &amp; Fridays I'll going back 2 hours days. plan sanitize gloves double masks even sit work.

The amount people hear talking COVID hoax amount people see gathering clubs (maskless) Houston terrifying me. vaccines created right demonstrated work across variance. read vaccine won‚Äôt work variant? Hodcroft, viral geneticist Bern university Switzerland, said Danish mutation: ‚ÄòUnfortunately, scientific information made available yet, impossible interpret may may mean.‚Äô

‚ÄòWe yet know¬†what kinds studies done, actual outcomes were. Further, context evaluate whether something could really make difference humans vaccines existing immunity.‚Äô‚Äù

Everyone need take major freaking chill pill. evidence even human human transmission. comments specific thread mink situation totally control. Sable / mink etc intelligent, hyperactive, fierce creatures, born seek, hunt &amp; outwit prey. suffer terribly cages. hope Denmark reform laws end cruel trade... Russia probably delighted though, they‚Äôre next biggest fur traders. üòê known large portion population cross border daily school, work, shopping visiting family.

I believe far common cartel violence started escalating early 2000's.  Horrific. poor family. üò• seems slight decrease new cases though Yes, especially since asthma roommates. Oh look.... symbiote like Venom.
Funny mirrors key movies huh? No, new news mutated, antibodies ""normal"" Sars-2 strong new corona virus, meaning vaccines coming soon may effective. That‚Äôs main question though, US sovereign currency issuer, ‚Äúpaying back‚Äù essentially means destroying initial dollars spent economy first place. US ‚Äúprints‚Äù money, spends economy, isn‚Äôt deficit reflected surplus economy? that‚Äôs true, ‚Äúpaying back‚Äù via tax revenues, would mean destroying surplus balance government budget. Im saying print money will, primary concern impacts inflation versus deficits lens.

I think could spent enough money help corona, reason didn‚Äôt legislative branch thinks government currency user versus currency issuer. I.e. government household, isn‚Äôt. Neither meat food are. worries! confusion understandable, seeing rules often make much sense. would say give time information come out! think they'll English articles updates. agree though, waiting game toughh yes, tragic. love El Paso. That's victim blaming! Mink revolution! would argue saving one human life worth ending 20 million mink lifes? LMAO non-american here, american cheese refer to? like, cheddar? we‚Äôre eating killing disposing bodies humans 2021: oh thank god finally over

god: oh getting started saw skin three males less second. brother Brian even better. linked article said: 

""about half 783 infected Danes northern part country infected mutated strain stems farms""

Were get 12?  Jeff sure question anything said.  again? You‚Äôre mom, lol! stop farming minks please. basically we‚Äôre situation forever? Fuck life. Oh sweet summer child. finding help world identify origins COVID-19? get treating animals like garbage long. sound like it'd make sense preventative procedure covid-19 patients. They'd need reason it.  seems like shut affected area completely stomped out. think piece information relevant here. know. might many folks taking COVID seriously R value 1. imagine could even lower everyone else took seriously.

A R value 1 means it‚Äôs stable. COVID, R value 0.5 means half cases gone two weeks. R value 0.25 mean 75% cases gone two weeks. Lower better faster. Yeah many countries seen rise cases slow *before* lockdown effects come play. 

IIRC countries effect. everyone talking potential lockdown people start cautious own. makes sense. Yep, I'm 90% positive vaccine end pandemic distributed enough people. You‚Äôre joking right? also complete bullshit Boy CCPers get pretty wrong, you? Taiwan running outreach continuously since beginning pandemic, wait run country trouble it. ask them, take brief look they're lot people seem get it.

Lockdown gave meaning people's empty lives. want nuclear war. Please, let's reset. pretend know future, one else either. government leaves people act responsibly protect others people fail act responsibly government steps enforces restrictions. restrictions bring case count enough suppose impose harsher stricter restrictions. card play. Anything people start screaming unfairness much government control. Luckily person charge comfort speculating. I'm sure charge better access detailed information sit discuss done, think do. That's it, try statistic best protect around you. Someone playing plague inc easy mode 17 000 metric tonnes 4-6 days worth electricity depending minks‚Äô body mass generates usable energy. Curious PETA thinks. it‚Äôs good production mink coats stop (or slow) good, it‚Äôs likely killed. bad. 

Either way, hope doesn‚Äôt make pandemic even complicated!!! type mutation different though since involves transmission across species. Thus means selective pressure human host removed equation mutations occurred mink farms. type reverse zoonosis mutation events kind wildcards new strain much greater potential induce unpredictable effects reintroduced humans.

For particular class mutation event, definitely need everything keep isolated region Denmark get better idea strain affect humans, one's who've infected previously strains who's first infection new strain.

Again: different type mutation event others we've seen far pandemic, need cautious since class mutation events carry greater risk completely changing character pandemic. mean sure happen case, something go drastically wrong course pandemic, types things would cause I'm loss one... maybe try calling Co-tarded?  Yes, gas eat them. Mink quite delicacy around here. HURR!DURR!DURR! [WHUT what? private clinics treat corona, Medsi, Lapino, K+31. didnt say that. dont know death rate, know like 12 people sure So, European countries seem stopped setting one-day case records. That's something, least. rapid covid test could stop shit easily like China testing millions 1 week forced shutdown permanently. animal abuse. Hi guys!

Bit weird one, friend mine sharing lot misinformation FB profile, also friends sharing similar things too.

For part, ignore feel worth getting involved make things worse.

One friends recently shared [this much. 

Can help create reply basically explain serious written image wrong, elegant way.

Thank Pretty cool still somewhat mutually intelligible. keep hearing go away election cities seeing third wave. I'm heartbroken hometown. problem people, politicians. Unfortunately. What? Thought Sweden achieved herd immunity long ago. Weird. totally understand. I'm sure would even go trying track something like down. Perhaps controversial referenced article date, would possible find recorded press conference... Mink US saw another article. Christ. Sorry, sequenced, edited typo. tried work. really want? speak surgeon concerns. don‚Äôt recommend asking strangers Reddit type advice - vast majority commenters thread medical doctors experts. Best luck. Don‚Äôt mean fur lockdown? Flu shots completely stock local pharmacies. can‚Äôt imagine violence storm covid 19 vaccine comes out. need ~~hunt more~~ eat less meat. get it? election's yet! /s  late now. Fuck Trump. One first things bought February pulse oximeter (they're still available, $20) bother ER physicians still mild case.

Do think might made difference girl prescribed aspirin? I'm idiot. I'm genuinely curious talking point two weeks _doesn't_ decrease cases? Seriously...on somewhat bright note though, turns new strain deadlier triggers dengue style immune response people who'd already infected original, related set strains, least world stands solid chance containing newer strain within EU, considering limited travel different global regions moment. I'm concerned keeping new strain EU countries may prove difficult people still buy mink fur? something else? immoral, end us change things asap.

People realize much help environment simply cutting meat.

I love meat knew going full vegan going work, stopped eating beef entirely 8 months ago honestly very, easy. Pork probably next go me. sure give chicken though! mean, d-dimer pretty easy anyone actually goes ER. (Not doctor, blood clot before). work lab really hard hit area UK see WILD numbers comes people's blood clotting screens, blood behave... oddly. Normally sample clot centrifuge serums nicely settled top. COVID patients, seem getting lot incidents serum become weirdly clotted gel centrifuging, can't explain why. difficult ask doctors rebleed patient blood turned solid.

I never really thought potential long term impact clots would inside someone's organs. IMPORTANT - check COVID-19 subreddit thread this. reassuring. 

Yes, concerned, doomsday 2020: Im worst year ever!

2021: Hold beer... want works: social distance, wash hands frequently, stay home sick, wear masks public.

Unenforceable ""lockdowns"" useless. Probably important distinction made thread respect it. anger issues fucking tools like Nanochip talking about. thanks!  I'm evolutionary geneticist - incorrect assign mutations adaptations specifically human mink populations without data. best, speculate case, evolutionary biologists ALWAYS avoid making adaptive claims like without cold, hard evidence (ignoring evo-psych bs). Please abuse evolutionary genetics confusing hypothesis result. would need show that, compared original strain, new mink strain somehow evades mink immune system better infectious humans - something certainly shown. 

You reason conclusion probably incorrect regardless data. original spike protein's amino acid sequence changed since first transmitted humans, therefore forced adapt anything. Whatever adaptations may may happened would happened original reservoir species (like bats) first human infection - otherwise first human transmission would possible all. that, apply logic minks - whatever allowed virus transmit minks occurred either humans, or, knowing original spike protein sequence unaltered, original reservoir species. Furthermore, claim somehow adapted minks readapted humans straight incorrect simply possible. 

Please edit correct original comment. Darwin already abused much fundamentalists, please also abuse ideas either. Congratulations!! *claps* Puh, heathen STOP
USING
ANIMALS Agreed. Animals raised, transported slaughtered humanely. Crops grown sustainably without pesticides. much suffering, polluting waste, purely sake greed, callousness and/or laziness.  :(

Worse, much tossed away wasted. Denmark trash incinerators, no? Can't reserved used? Ahaha ur idiot. 

Active mutation equal active threat. 

And right now, active threat. currently understand mutation react react vaccination efforts. strain literally currently active 12 people information peer reviewed. Useless irrelevant post current vaccine rollout DOMINANT Covid strain. 

Some one read title don‚Äôt think lol.

Edit: exact person reference talk media literacy courses need mandatory public education. lol Bloody minks wearing masks I'm looking good way visualize hospital load. useful chart showing percentage hospital capacity vs previous years? 2022. virus using immune response infect cells. suggested SARS-CoV-2 exhibit signs ADE, nothing proven. would hope so. $1200 didn‚Äôt exactly last 10 weeks like Mnuchin said would‚Äôve. really hope get something figured ASAP know tons people need help. incinerating them, already started. God fucking dammit, /r/AskOuija 2 cousins babies covid - extended family actually rallied done extra quarantine help could regular times us work home! spent WAY time normally would have! fur? fur ok, asking friend. True! minks wore masks, would adorable *and* life saving. Guess they'll never learn. Hey there.

I'm Pakistan find region (eastern europe) really interesting mysterious. Especially balkan states like. Would love visit someday !

I love Eastern Europe really fascinated culture there. 

Yeah, must feel weird guy Pakistan saying you, right?

Anyhow, authority, would make sure vaccine fairly distributed region well others, less development.

Being direct neighbors China, we'll one top priorities get first vaccine batches. Maybe Prime Minister redirect side well, knows ! ( get ambassador Pakistan get touch Relevant authorities, we'll happy help ! ) Yes. pretty much response BSE cows UK. Lol tinfoil hat showing milder secondary infections severe. Also need covid become less deadly. happened past. knows covid-20+ damaged organs able deal repeatedly attacked like wont really want see sort expert commentary peer reviewed study assuming true.

It seems like hasn‚Äôt really picked mainstream sources serious threat, seem interested implications evil mink industry.  UK burnt cow carcasses huge pyres open fields BSE crisis. Admittedly handled really badly outset, times saw huge bonfires cows trains travelling time. Probably thing said ""a China problem"" back January. Read books idea seen confirmed case someone infected car yet. infect them. Little boxes filled lethal gas, incinerate carcasses. wouldnt good opportunity stop shit altogether? Yea EU people protesting masks lockdowns... tried repost let said link posted last 2 days.

There good research study indicates people wearing masks improperly causing spread, information known. Presumably exposure include B cells either? know would make difference. still exist wild mutated minks easily transmitted minks, easily spread minks. huge farms thousands minks close proximity + easy spread = lots chances mutation infection got going. transmitting lot cows chickens (but similar epi/pandemics previously - see Swine flu Avian flu, originated popular animals like swine chickens).  STOP CAGING ANIMALS CONFINED SPACES!!! LEARNED??? REALLY FUCKING STUPID!!! Hey, maybe I'm line here, but, hear this, like send mink fur owners along minks? thought, idk. Testing waters one might say. think humanely kill live? Non-vegan humans*.

I've seen wheat field afterwards.   means? Damn, father said mother mink(s? know used plural). Horrible think might go this. 

Might seen years. luck SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutating rather slowly. messed giving opportunity infect 10s millions. Covid-20 out, good job.  really think mink strain gonna spread beyond Denmark really hope gets rest world start thinking seriously zoonotic disease detection pandemic prevention

now climate change, urban crowding, factory farming making lot easier outbreaks start, preventing next pandemic going difficult necessary effort... resources needed prevention expensive still like 2% total US military budget, shit obviously gets lot expensive eradicate disease actually reached epidemic status better time buy mink coat mean  Yah brutal. 17 million? Holy shit. I'm kind surprised many people still wearing mink fur. Farmed fur. Hunting 17 mink would be... Challenging... üòä
The mink north American exist wild Invasive species. know Machine Learning (what plebs call AI) probably ass suspected lung cancer originate scaring hypothesis far know. guess next couple years find lung damage spikes fairly easy make connection Yes, that's going happen anyway, slowly. Fine. Agreeing said. aside, would reply original question you? hopefully something press release this. i'm facinated bacteriophages, virus attack bacteria used medicinally countries &amp; came across this. believe science data. believe in? It‚Äôs clearly that. Well last part lockdown stated government. told info follow.. *just* El Paso? Holy shit, shocking. Lol y‚Äôall hilarious Sorry hear that, friend. old buddy Oliver died cat illness. best pal 11 years, I‚Äôm sending big hug know hard without buddy. might ask southern neighbours knowhow know going back full lockdown? announce yet? knew mink Covid-19 outbreak June taking measures finally mutated. Really Denmark?? endangered future humanity fucking fur coats??? I've never little faith humanity year. Many us fucking dumb disgusting  I'm mistaken assuming, look compare US. ZERO trust US government administration, I'm sure rest world would agree statement. wait see vaccine work one. Likely we're gonna find within next couple days. already sample strain guess expose vaccine, know right exposed particular antibodies, actual vaccine(s) effective going be. Love  remember used better russian disinformation agent Y‚Äôall dumb paranoid sub it‚Äôs hilarious. mean guess it‚Äôs bad guys mostly downvoted even allowed events 1000 people october 1th, change last week. yeah shitshow well know covid19 came sarscov2 yet? Agree, much larger scale many meat farms much (not all, anti-meat position). yo thats fucked #minklivesmatter Considering 0,1% cases sequences, probably 12,000 cases. bet already Europe least around Denmark. Man, went college DK honestly pretty disappointed huge mink industry. Sooooo mink fur prices or? Preach man kill humans animals !! know less deadly though? less deadly, might actually good let spread around. Imagine acting like setting environment Given judged situation, reducing risk happening still appealed you. obviously negligence.

What told take aspirin luck ran regardless? article mention every medical step Cause surely won‚Äôt impact ecology. stupid premise. sounds traumatic everyone involved absolutely!!! sure would!! late already already took action weeks ago. could bringing health care workers abroad right now. 

Not many; busy home countries, IIRC countries allowing medical personnel leave last spring would *not* surprise find thing happening fall/winter. run actual trial primates though confirm? Get monkeys, infect COVID, wait recover. infect new strain see happens. Danish virus.

Yeah Danish Mink Farmer Tycoon comes soon Humans important animals planet. ones 'farm' make clothes skin might give us virus fucking kill we'll breed new ones hahaha.

Humanity fucking demented got test April. hospital work employees. Gassing burning, become. reminds time certain group humans. I've actually heard several people say seriousness Puppy mills. stopping spread? Prioritize vaccines people likely die it, minimize movement groups slow/stop spread. 

There *so* many valid things complain terms power/monetary imbalance old young, seem like one them. puppy mills FL bad local laws around selling bred dogs pet stores. Oh I'm alarmed alrighty Exactly everyone register vote Negativity bias people exploded worst case situation happened real life Corona. seems likely really happen again. Yeah, I'll still fuck dead alive Maybe just.. don‚Äôt know? Stop exploiting killing animals food/clothing first place? wouldn‚Äôt mess left animals alone would far less likely chance jump animals humans proof reinfections. done sequencing infections prove two different strains therefore must two different infections.

Seems 10k day today possible.  say spread rodents, minks rodents, factory-farm rats mice. close quarters low sanitation allow spread mutate animal farm environments, frequent close contact humans boomerangs back us. know rodent susceptibility might be, us go around licking floor boards, we're *probably* okay front. going months though like walking cloud mink dust/mucus/blood/body fluids doubt researchers saw saw.

Animal agriculture strikes again! ready go vegan yet? well able test though? identifiable new strain current PCR/Antigen tests? mink strain demonstrated spread human human.

It proven fact something like 50% people tested positive area Jutland mink version, indicated spread humans.

Not many people actually work mink. One part daily refined industrial operation involves wholesale mechanical maceration.

Firstly, hunting moral imperative. stewards world, that, nature depends us prevent animals overrunning areas, wiping species beneficial us, etc.

Secondly, think animal farming truly unnecessary seems like extremely privileged mindset. Many people depend animal consumption use survival right now. slaughter harvesting organs body parts medical testing protection improving plant farming. think it‚Äôs extremely easy make case things done manner minimizes suffering.

If throw hands cowardice say animals shouldn‚Äôt suffer all, you‚Äôre wittingly unwittingly arguing a) increase human suffering decrease animal suffering, b) even increases total amount suffering world species.

This mindset na√Øve, privileged, selfish, immoral, unreasonable, plain stupid. mink earn privilege existing anymore?

I work hospital. It‚Äôs been...less good.

For reference, sounded like Ash *Evil Dead thought gonna read 858 new cases. mai freedom! Yeah, round 1000 1000

Checkmate like 2.3 9/11s week, 13 9/11s every month? conservative tears now? 8 months? Feels like 18 already. Specifically referencing company based USA able get approval process start getting distribution vaccine. Hah! There's parking lot Atlanta cops watch people starting GPS ticket pull onto road. right really enforce hands free MA. fact unblinding happened yet means no, looked data. Currently correct report way, effective vaccine covid ready point. happens widely available global community much deadly flu tools available managing flu. check facilities website: may remind you, contesting patients get transferred -- obviously true. claimed ""in border town faster go German hospital"", seems dubious since town talking hospitals. Another way look 858 deaths France equivalent 4,300 deaths US adjusting population. Yeah US definitely upward trend Europe way ahead right now. That's two 9/11 per week, outrage? know someone complete blockage LCA. First local hospital, prefered specialized university hospital. lucky, weeks later (around time would've procedure), coronavirus outbreak cardiology department hospital. switched hospitals, wait even longer. Days procedure, delayed week, urgent case go him. finally received operation (all went well luckily). week later, hospital announced massively scaling back non urgent surgeries. I'd guess lucky.

Luckily urgent, could've probably waited bit longer, good got treated surgeries scaled back. waiting months already (since first wave).

Another question, opt CABG instead CTO PCI. PCI puts less stress body.

I hope get better quickly! course that's what's going happen.

Anyone thinks Zimbabwe Cambodia getting vaccines U.S. U.K. already vaccinated whole population multiple times kidding themselves. likely getting fined. think they'll enforce this. They've done mediocre job enforcing 'travel ban'. animated graph really telling ad Dakota's done since June 1. states started pushing masks, others pretend masks work. would looked like people could lock down? personal experience talked people could heavily advocated it, family still working onsite, met shoulder shrug ‚Äúthanks making sacrifices keep society going‚Äù change subject. Would full lock mean real sacrifices everyone could isolate?


Edit- saw lot ‚Äúour vulnerable‚Äù working grocery stores etc, don‚Äôt think given option isolate. also bring US A, though? Yeah radiators checked winter. plumber showed mask nice. post jest.  clear. I'm talking busy streets bars, NYC, Miami, ft Lauderdale, Chicago, San Francisco etc think giving vaccine local pubs. knows kind facilities Li√®ge?

You acting totally common bring people across borders Europe medical care. strange happens also pandemic happening. mean... impact lockdowns much harm.

It black white. shit open still wear masks safe.

That happy compromise here. 50% population average intelligence another 10% aren‚Äôt much smarter.  

If 40% many encumbered religious political beliefs limit willing learn.   

Doesn‚Äôt leave much.... US lots places would probably low risk COVID outdoors wearing mask. Northern ton pedestrians perhaps traffic cops worried. think people ok wearing masks going store around (you get let without one) outside I've seen go ways. live near popular biking walking trail I'd say 60% people wear mask (or carry one fail put time). EveryoneLikedThat.jpg it‚Äôs guarantee either ‚Äî households (with one person go public) could minimize that.

If get point home behaviour enforced, *regardless* proof household members actually infectious, that's start serious issue. American kind idiots Canada fuck em care. I‚Äôve worn mask every time I‚Äôve left apartment protect idiots. don‚Äôt want get vaccine that‚Äôs fine me, get vaccine I‚Äôm done caring idiots. heard polled bunch 6 year old girls agreed Diarrhea beautiful name daughter. want believe story mom told ü§£ list contains hospitals like CHR, emergency rooms ICUs.

The mortality rate covid young women what? 0.12 per cent? (According article. That's 0.12 %, less 1%)

So increase 70 per cent means goes 0.12 per cent 0.18 per cent. Still small number.

Yet, scary think young woman die.
I testws poaitive corona 10 days ago. wife pregnant sill negative. Hope remains negative! :) Well, yes. Yeah, maybe - get feeling cops supportive wearing mask (or would see it). Iowa hit 40%.

In opinion ""The Experts"" pretty much lost credibility this. [Think stupid average person realize half em stupider Sorry - realize mentally ill. respect disability, I'll leave alone. Beverly seeing superior really helps, particularly pandemic. That's part East Asian countries done really well -- they're illusion insurmountable best world. suspect that's also part many US liberals tend react better conservatives -- many buy notion US medical system sucks worse many countries.

Compared I've lived cops almost never stop people. Clearly declare propaganda site. accessed news ! site posting death cases, know that, add election day caption ?!

What remedy, way forward, non obvious facts want know. know pandemic, people getting infected, succumbing.. mean rest panic stay home. could‚Äôve saved many done earlier seven hospitals Li√®ge:

Even ""normal times"" lived Aachen people brought Li√®ge. Better facilities?  I'm copying wrote another post back, excess deaths Brazil:

""

The excess deaths 19th September recorded 151.059, covid deaths 136.565 date. 10.6% reported deaths.

One thing consider covid reported deaths Brazil indicate reported happened, Amazonas state, instance, reported hundreds deaths October revised covid deaths happened beginning pandemic, number might get lower.

Source: Yes!! Soon go back normal.  So...whens roll out? bring kneepads suffer dearly funny thing people hold example non-lockdown approach know actually taking actions covid here, lockdown. conservatives arguing ignore virus fallen myth propagated international media (that nothing done here), similarily bunch people side political spectrum fallen media lies use Sweden kind example happens ignore virus (protip: ignoring virus) Everything Gottlieb anticipates usually money. one reliable talking heads are. Probably flag politics and/or incivility. undertone argument. Thanks, rural Missouri, two cities trying contain shit! OPEN DANG WINDA! 1,100 deaths second sentence pure hogwash. lying politician says something make true. Sweden pretty high fatality rate look correct data (590 per million population). Order magnitude similar UK, Italy, France far behind US (719). 

Sweden world class health care system higher fatality rate developing countries Asia. any, would regard place like Hong Kong Singapore places extremely low fatality rate (14 5 per million population respectively). case actually control, political label used make think things good. depends largely are.

I'm ashamed say i've never voted life went today make sure part. sucks. idea healthcare frontline workers managing days. Title misleading. actually showed 100% accuracy asymptomatic cases 97.1% accuracy symptomatic forced cough. telling wear masks start needed preserve mask supplies health professionals. believed unnecessary. answer yes. exactly! distinctly remember watching make statement jaw dropping.  back why/how could justify statement, clearly lie. went common sense.

Good night, everyone.

# TeamTam even say low, given high percentage people get serious infections, hospitalizations, virus proving long term effects. want get serious case thing matter age 20% NYC infected? doesn‚Äôt sound right. also pretty sick around Christmas NYE skip events looked forward year... same, late February/early March got really sick think going bar birthday admittedly really dumb That's true. I‚Äôm usually SW fan I‚Äôll flying Delta story. stupid vote person let get bad denied existence? understand president's actions lack caused deaths. Seriously, think would mean died loved one died. would lives different? would changed forever. pull kills small amount people card. That's like saying going walk blindfold across empty highway night. also proven irreversible damage lungs impacts immune system. Nah, precise infection fatality rate known less SARS worse flu took mid April pin within factor two three true value. population NYC infected infected March April. Thought ending today? :| I'm class rn. masks seen. distance held. forget Covid even thing fact several teachers students tested positive last weeks. already schooled number points, record Sweden repeatedly said never pursuing herd immunity strategy. ""Fake News."" vaccines available election...oh...  Trump knew February. China plenty cases see evidence. people still denial. winter US going get really bad. look current covid tests then. Nothing perfect even things like stds utis problemo. side note, wanna see spider porn? Mastery? many people master even one thing life? Id say less 1% mastery super high level imo. Yes researchers still need paid. Equipment materials still need purchased. 

It's like free. Also implementing scale may cost pretty penny. 'whimper' then? ""Should remote school?""

""Nah sally forth in-person"" Oh sports ball working pandemic! like Wisconsin something 5000 people day get COVID state also, givernment keen prevent situation, except appealing people reasonable.
masks coming way slow, even rise counts decided follow decision allow public gatherings 1000 people.... all, rather troublesome decisioning. digital startup . Net? yeah, try telling fault washing hands, wearing masks sticking social distancing. 8,651 new cases, 146 deaths, 1,001 intensive care *AIM* eradication, i.e. robust R&lt;&lt;1, via continuously improving TTI, hygiene measures contact restrictions. Trumps travel ban China even worse that, banned Chinese citizens everyone else allowed still fly U.S. 

Not ineffective travel ban, also stoked xenephobia. constantly making ""far right"" turns originally published NY Times. maybe seems larger factor might early long one infectious - mostly couple days symptoms even show remember reading. long incubation period also seems give false sense safety. President compared beginning took common comparison going back making valid comparisons. defend it, even slightly, people understand flu affected really seen corona viruses least understand impact. 

Which, unfortunately, good portion US concerned it, impacted apparently death toll impressive enough change opinion. see many stories people's tunes change directly/indirectly impacted it, matter grasping concept. testing means lower calculated mortality rate since finding asymptomatic/light/mild cases. Plus there's physical benefit testing mortality rate (being able isolate protest risk population easily). understand argument.

If stoped t3sting asymptomatic... positivity rate raise?

If stable... lowering... suggest situation getting better... it? Yup, utah resident too. Manager small convenience store. directives corporate owner. circumstances enforce masks, ignore DoH orders. supposed do? OSHA care, department health doesnt care. Lose job? think cases high stay top moment. never said that. Ketosis reduce organ damage virus needs glucose replicate. Given one East mentioned previous post, I'd think Eastern Europe, right? prioritize Western developed countries under-developed Eastern countries? cause privilege rich? mean ""this""? know is, surprised high, reason would expect country like Switzerland lot top testing. life, see. month without income business means bankruptcy. governments plans strategies help business effective way. 
The issue much complex simply locking everything month. What‚Äôs alternative? Keeping everything close indefinitely? Moreover, everything opened summer grandfather's died year pandemic 3 months apart. due covid. 86 point almost say let run rampant. like Rom Hanks holding Percy I‚Äôm Green Mile. 

‚ÄúNo. watch.‚Äù adults UK 65 children &lt;18? Keto doesn‚Äôt kill Covid wtf Universities great pressure monetize- even individual departments / labs. won‚Äôt private industry product, money factor. agree inflation wouldn‚Äôt go taxes need go up? federal government doesn‚Äôt use taxes fund spending, uses tool offset inflation taking money circulation. inflation isn‚Äôt increasing taxes need go up? seems arbitrary so. American news legitimate sentence. Ha ‚ÄúNY numbers lower achieved herd immunity‚Äù kept going beginning October 4-5%. Since week got positivity rate around 25%. mix enough testing mostly loosing control.
We wen't 500 new cases day 10'000 4 weeks. number Poland's confirmed coronavirus infections grown since Tuesday record 24,692 new cases, reached 439,536, health ministry said Wednesday morning.  373 persons died, highest daily total far, bringing death toll 6,475.  Health Ministry also reported 18,654 people confirmed coronavirus infection hospitalised, 408,121 quarantine, 43,549 sanitary-epidemiological supervision. far, 168,960 people recovered. Agreed!! heard radio too. talking good thing, reality reduce number test lot.

Deaths still rising guess keep rising while, obviously hope otherwise. 

I guess like 2 months act like everything's fine make mistake opened everything last time.

This country doomed run idiots. someone wears KN95s seals cracks completely surgical tape, nope, glasses STILL fog up, even given this. totally agree this. single week hard lockdown beginning would probably helped lot. Absolutely agreed Asian country randomly wear masks time various reasons. Glasses fogging up, smelling breath, mask getting damp breath/sweat - masks f**ing hell. wear KN95s even much open door house now, way hell like want keep need gone. smart ü§£ü§£ symptoms March got antibody test May. IgM positive IgG negative. Got tested IgG September, still negative.

So, likely infection long term immunity. Greenland kind part Denmark say Denmark much lower population density Sweden. would make much sense, thinking large areas northern Sweden would help stopping spread Stockholm.
Population density plays role sure, guess part Greenland parts Lappland benefit it. mean value population density whole country useful. know anything universities work days? :P Thank Facebook I'm done caring people. There's always one. never heard security theater before. live different worlds maybe? source ""just likely get again""? Everything find seems pretty inconclusive length immunity (yes antibodies gone still memory cells) rare reinfections happening. Thank you, u/FUCKS_WITH_SPIDERS Japan arguably Sweden significantly lower fatalities despite elderly population

[Genetic risk factor severe disease death almost absent East I've simulated victim EMT practical exams. need runny oatmeal fake vomit. bother dye, peas carrots, etc. really followed situation Switzerland, what's positivity rate!? Well, also wartime censorship apparently something news getting there. Biden wins, duh! Also, asymptomatic given time, lot asymptomatic people convert symptomatic later. Everybody lies. November2019* precise infection fatality rate known less SARS

Which probably able spread far did, precisely less lethal. Interesting! Could elaborate from? severe long-term problems people developing. I'm aware one scientific studying showing indications case, I'm curious know Security theater that. visited NYC days around 20th February, feel like really dodged bullet getting sick going later. Glad friend lived also made back home Canada without getting too. Agreed, article initially found American news source, legitimate competition agree.
My point list/compare data per country numbers get.

During first wave big differences cases deaths different areas country. true several countries like germany spain italy france etc. Usually population density played role there.. lockdowns spared entire areas. Still numbers expressed based whole country population comparisons based that. people still go isolate forget Presidencies UK dont wear one false all. Sorta. China report symptomatic cases symptomless cases, keep two figures seperate. helps track timeline new clusters, i.e. new cases found asymptomatic become symptomatic later, know caught cluster early.

While government kinds credibility issues, think numbers China plausible given harshness measures. Australia reporting zero near zero cases well hard lockdown, contact-tracing invasive China's. What's infection rate countries? indian cities 30-50% seropositivity, antibody studies happen show. Blah blah blah, ""Herd Immunity"", blah blah blah.

Yeah, right. Mink tatar common dish.. Yes, many European countries necessary resources sequence many samples patients, therefore detect occurrences. Hard say happening populated areas world lower resources. think safe assume several instances similar corners world. understanding translation mutated strain Sars-Cov-2 (the virus) crossed mink human.

Covid-19 disease. Sars-cov-2 virus. turned 28 27 sick. current hypothesis many mink farms infected seagulls area spread disease. [Corona found seagull mutation... Vaccine might different, yeah, fuck us Meanwhile, crooked attorney general filed injunction stop unlawful lockdown El Paso. 

You literally can't make shit up. Even shocking (to me) well far right polls. surreal. real?  Scientist warns can't turn backs COVID-19 holidays: Maybe local areas? Like st george ‚ÄúReal estate prices never lower... it‚Äôs hard getting customers‚Äù means could likely happening elsewhere world without control... Correct?

(Not minks) It'll bounce back people free move safely wearing masks taking precautions without worrying tens thousands new infections hundreds deaths daily.

It shows happens majority people cooperate rather let turn political scream incoherently infringing rights/freedom. hospitals already maxed flying patients stopping elective procedures getting ready triage them

Why say this?

Utah used 58% ICU capacity. I'm glad voted back in. We're number one!!! Cool. agree me. thought so. really can‚Äôt catch break 2020, we? Rather common breakfast denmark positive rate spikey?  look Hope-Simpson curves. reasons east-west divide Yeah went drum bass show locally March 10th, great night, sold plenty room, last show year turned :( 

Glad got good shows brief great traveling trip February early March. long China said ok respond Hm.

From May - second similar update afterwards, can't find (all links history svt.se broken?). keep looking, think higher lower? better source? news Swedish, posted periodically translations.

EDIT: article I'm thinking of, July  new strain transmit easily humans? mutated significantly mink, possible lost adaptation humans? also expect something similar, maybe make mixed vaccine protects high number strains couple years. thing is, pandemics stop problem reach balance virus, far away right beginning. can't believe live country corporation tell employees ignore directives government organizations person who's likely punished concerned citizen cares lives families others community. read various forums, believe strong possibility, media really talk since also suggests possibility virus originate China, brought one foreign athletes, first covid cluster Wuhan discovered days Military Games ended, ""Wet Market"" first covid cluster discovered 1 mile Military Games held. We'll probably never know whether wet market cluster infected athletes, way around.

Not sure consider NYPost credible, here's link found topic contain lot Freedum! explains shortness breath started July 6 improved yet. No. reason Tegnell Giesecke busy spring telling world Sweden‚Äôs strategy one based scientific evidence measures implemented countries ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù, ‚Äúunscientific‚Äù ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù.

Utah‚Äôs hospitals already maxed flying patients stopping elective procedures getting ready triage Basically this...the Covid Vaccine like Flu vaccine, try get mix right every year 'curtail' flu, never actual thought prevented. Spot on. Adapting vaccines might possible, take lots time.

Maybe, something learn Asia.
They problem scenario. Fuck that! Lmao late november last year, newborn diagnosed rsv even tho didnt test positive it. pediatric er went told us 7 children come day get tested half also didnt test positive rsv. Fast foreward end decemeber, whole house except newborn gets sick 2 week spell. Mid January february whole house except newborn sick. sick weve ever been. never seen 2 young children lethargic month. husband didnt get finally beginning lockdowns. month February, daughters school sent home letter deatiling us high reported case illness school needed check temps everyday coming in. daughter sent home atleast 3 times developing fever school one 2 days. ohio add this, press conference say minks Denmark killed Denmark biggest mink farming industry world, pretty drastic yet course necessary come something else talk about, probably.

Google ""ADE Virus"" - easier typing - basically virus longer dies antibody, instead uses invade cells, like trojan horse sorta - vaccines past caused this, viruses this.  So, sleep well. LOL. I'd chill people demanding respect right spread deadly disease rather mildly uncomfortable ones trying control reproductive system decades. Stress picking COVID-19 patients? Yes, certainly people sides advocating personally think deal pandemic.

And sides shut fuck take break social media.

Let governments medical professionals lead way. responsible citizens, duty listen follow advice. Antibody tests done big lab places, don‚Äôt need doctor get one.

It takes like week show numbers. Lots Midwest hospital running redline staff redline 8 months

The sick bat could eating fruit, drops pig pen, pig eats it, gets sick.

Butcher kills pig, wipes face, he's infected.

Virus mutates, man goes walk, mutated virus spreads.

The bat could contracted virus contaminated food waste, disposed cramped rodent farm.

Eating wild bat may surest way, way get infected. hashtag fire fauci! need doctors telling us do! I'll eat hamburgers fries every meal want to!  US good Australia despite completely screwing COVID? Poor mink :( STOP FACTORY FARMING. hell mass slaughter 17 million mink? without humans getting infected process? know many infected new strain? ""Fixed bug caused program crash interacting antibodies"" It‚Äôs disturbing minks factory farmed make coats one really needs. get sick die. pretty normal way viruses recombine. MERS came egyptian tomb bats camels. seem recall another older coronavirus going bats civet cats fairly similar mink. We're heading way without trump. individuals local communities take precautions follow guidelines. knew PETA going bite us ass.  think end vaccine? Spanish flu pandemic ended people started getting immunity around 1920, even tho virus still present. get immunity too? Knowing virus highly infectious. Sorry English btw it‚Äôs first language make sense China want announce early? Since would favour time? new decade upcoming season. 15-20 million farm minks Denmark. Mink farms account 0.7% Danish exports. it? election? 2020 stressed is!! Well, Danish primeminister march 11th announced Danish ""lockdown"" first country Northern Europe, take Tegnell 24 hours Swedish television explaining useless, unscientific populist Danish measures were. terms used repeated many times since. 

On background bewildering also listen myth, measures taken Sweden really different done nordic countries.

The two things simply cannot true time. 

And someone spent equal amounts time Sweden Denmark since march guarantee Swedish measures different severity timing. early judge. Wait Q3 Q4 results. Brazil Russia Florida Texas lockdown Q2 well. Lol it‚Äôs still small enough contained dude. don‚Äôt know anything situation. Fears time high right reaction probably intense required idea satire not.  *Barometer starts plummeting* topped shy 100k cases day peak


This end first wave. Let's see second wave which(evidently Europe) worse first wave.

Also, many cases people mild symptoms told doctors self-isolate without tests such+people dont take test all/report doctors. yeah course, guess referring fur industry whole Covid-20? Since 2020 2019 Double mink Holocaust. won‚Äôt. 12 people tested positive it, it‚Äôs likely already well spread anyways. isn‚Äôt good farm minks. know anyone pets(maybe people certainly common). Lol, can't afford waste bullets. would literally forget wipe ass profitable somehow Herd immunity never answer precisely possibility mutations.

Hehe, whoopsy doodle. They're anybody claiming Covid 10x deadlier flu, peer reviewed study one renowned scientist world published study says, IFR \~0.23%. IFR people 70 \~0.05%. children, SARS CoV 2 even less dangerous Influenza.

The early high mortality caused treatment itself, like use ventilators, giving patients fever lowering immunosuppressive drugs giving patients toxic doses drugs like hydroxychloroquine.

So deadly moderate Influenza. WTF... even heavier... little fear new virus.

What fear government ineptitude that's shown dealing viruses, social unwillingness cooperate. apt response, yes. initial response covid supress news. believe me, search Chinese citizen journalism coronavirus. Jesus Christ fuck demand might supply mink fur sure going drop drastically. ""Less lethal"" word 2020 definitely thought Europe would know better...also considering people spending summer kind making fun us.

They spent summer telling us wrong, holiday traveling opening bars. could almost see coming. Fascinating! pedantry animal classifications helping suppress anxiety this. Mustelids weasel family, carnivores closely related rodents. Think weasels, otters, ferrets, etc. Thanks. okay last night. election results gettting dragged amplifying everything. point, accepted Grandparents gonna catch strain COVID die it, there's way avoid shit anymore fuckibg depressed Thats pretty drastic action, hopefully late. want quit game, forget downloading patch Stark's warning, 'Winter coming!' selfish POS. first strategy elimination, quarantining &amp; tracing.

improving treatments &amp; pursuing vaccine auxiliary efforts. events escalate month month, likely expect big explosion 2020 Oh fuck  Every mink Denmark

Don't think anyone keeps pets. fur industry 2020: .... talkin me? ..... *Hits across knees tire iron* started culling mink populations started transmitting population population without anyone able figure (it's since theorized seagulls carried virus physically populations), safety precaution incase might mutate.
The mutation stuff supposedly first made known government monday evening, alerted yesterday. Well... seems like 2021 actually 2020.2 really minks reservoir virus infect humans. animals get sick humans don‚Äôt infect humans.

If treatment could work minks, could treat them. seem ruthless. It‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm sure humans infected minks first. that‚Äôs proven. Fuck. announced press briefing now. Danish media reporting it. Fittingly, Prime ministers home parliament hit covid outbreak therefore self isolate expect everyone good things charity, wind nothing good every good person broke AF.

That's say expensive tool, rather paid public good. realm socialized medicine, deserve paid producing something good continue make good things, costs spread across entire population benefit it. Damn. sounds SERIOUS answer here.

Are domestic farm minks? kind impact ecosystem economy?

Surely minks important predator. Sorry you‚Äôre rough time. holidays seem especially sad year pandemic. want January. agree fur industry, faux fur compete real fur, demand it, especially colder climates. faux fur *also* environmentally friendly (its essentially plastic), insulate nearly well, also nearly breathable real fur. reason many people prefer real leather faux, better, lasts longer, made plastic, gets tossed landfill people done it. Human body kill HIV,but HIV also destroy immune system attacking T-cells Even pets? far municipalities strain go strict lockdown. hope enough. People seem exhausted restrictions now. 2020 weird. Mink soup. Plot Danes destroy great pastry industry. Etc. etc. Please Denmark, eat them.... Bingo. read stuff back January blew up. picture happen quite clear.

I still push much ""citable"" papers books, people respond well, authorities respond random citizens crisis. clear, I'm one arguing before. like analogies jumped conversation. =) feels good though. would never wear nice. roll newspapers, bop 2021 nose say ""no!"" gets ideas?

I like all. Reminds news coming China last December. Thanks assist, A-Train üèÉüèø tried.. infected farm others 7km radius.where put down. 
That enough. Restrictions? mutated deadly coronavirus? need true quarantine exposures contain this. [sadly may naught since virus mutated enough different host making possibly every vaccine development *fire kills everything*  2020  Danish mink must killed fear virus mutation

In worst case, risk pandemic starts based Denmark, says Statens Serum Institut.

All Danish mink must killed.

This Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S) says a¬†press conference¬†and calls ""extremely serious situation"".

- virus mutated mink, mutated virus spread humans.

It could bomb upcoming¬†coronavirus¬†vaccine¬†.

- mutated virus among mink may involve risk upcoming¬†vaccine will¬†not work should, says Prime Minister.

The worst case scenario pandemic starts based Denmark.

Corona observed today 207 mink farms Jutland.¬†The Statens Serum Institut found five examples mink farms 12 examples humans mutated viruses show reduced sensitivity to¬†antibodies¬†.

It serious, says K√•re M√∏lbak, director Statens Serum Institut.

- worst case scenario pandemic starts based Denmark, says.

Breeding animals must also killed

According Danish¬†Veterinary Food Administration¬†, 1,137 mink herds registered Denmark, approximately 12 million mink.

It possible mink breeders keep individual animals breeding continue later date.

- Even retention small amount breeding animals constitute risk, says Minister Food, Agriculture Fisheries Mogens Jensen (S).

He expresses sympathy mink breeders affected communities, stresses serious threat to¬†public health¬†.

- situation light end tunnel danger, says Mogens Jensen.

67 mink farms already herds killed, killing taking place collaboration police.

National Police¬†Chief Thorkild Fogde states putting turbo effort get minks killed.

- requires cooperation across the¬†authorities¬†, also cooperation mink breeders, sounds the¬†National Police Chief¬†.

New initiatives way North Jutland

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen¬†announces¬†new¬†measures¬†to contain infection mutated virus North Jutland.

This applies Jammerbugt, Hj√∏rring, Br√∏nderslev, Jammerbugt, Vesthimmerland, Thisted, Frederikshavn L√¶s√∏ Municipality, among others.

But yet clear new¬†initiatives¬†are coming.

The Serum Institute estimates five percent viral infections North Jutland new type virus mutation.

Health Minister Magnus Heunicke (S) urges people affected municipalities pay extra attention current¬†restrictions¬†.

- important the¬†support¬†of local population affected municipalities.¬†It especially important adhere to¬†guidelines¬†for a¬†maximum¬†of 10 people together, adhere rules distance bandages required.

In addition, increased test capacity area.

- further¬†restrictions¬†to curb activity affected municipalities, says.

The Danish Veterinary Food Administration¬†has made map see wherecorona infectionhasbeen found mink farmsin Denmark. fuck, Danes? election draining me, time high 1050 positives today.

Ontario population: 14.4mil. New York population: 19.4 mil.

Number Ontario tests 2 days ago: 27,908. 
Number New York tests 2 days ago: 127,869.

Ontario testing NEARLY enough. way 1050 cases. Danish flu ~ Trump Spot-on think less told us much same. fuckers *loud* people leave trash morning. new version Covid weaseled way Denmark? Happens cheap imported labor going farm farm handling animals. bad day me, Animorph stayed mink mode long stuck. Yeah we‚Äôre kind low point one want. conservative leaders dropping ball again. one complains economy one wants invest money oil one took 7 weeks acknowledge upward trend said ‚Äúshocked‚Äù it. announced hit record 1000 new positives opening everything again. first wave average high like sub 600 think average 1000 he‚Äôs taking restrictions economy.

Too bad doesn‚Äôt realize able see movie go gym helps economy people aren‚Äôt afraid go half potential customers aren‚Äôt hospital dead. Big brain move him. TBH mind dying quickly. seems like dangerous previous. different enough affected anti bodies covid-19. summation, lost argument make SINGLE COUNTERPOINT. Little bro, lol.  support conscription bigger military too. Luckily armed forces ar assisting officials authorities covid soon requested. well prepared usually, media depicts incapable.

Like lies spread around operability fighter Jets, claimed count fully functioning EF- jets one hand. blatant lie.

There‚Äôs probably poetic justice way treat animals, Wuhan Denmark, causing much chaos. Something rotten state Denmark. learned 

Humans learn anything. Well damn, that‚Äôs depressing obviously covid-2020. summation, lost argument you‚Äôre child. Grow stop calling valid information ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù you‚Äôre afraid it. Little bro, lol. Gas them, burn them? Bury them? sure there's still infection possibility. guess ultimately curiosity handled really needing know. People still using fur? Real wtf there. Denmark locked like rest Europe, widespread opposition idea. uh, count that. Authorities appealed local population affected areas observe guidelines dilligently.

Danish guidelines are: 1 meter distancing (except school/educational settings). Wash hands.

Public gatherings 10 people max. Private (in private home) gatherings subject 10 person guideline, regulation.

Masks mandated restaurants, bars cinemas - except seated. Masks mandated stores public transportation, workplaces.

I worry rest world going quarantine us now. good treatment scar tissues organs. Sensitivity true positive rate (out actually infected, percent get positive tests).

Specificity true negative rate (out infected, percent get negative tests).

These measures make ROC curve opposite one another. Think said every one positive, sensitivity would 100% specificity would 0%. vice versa one positive. Put another way, True positives come cost false positives (i.e. 1 - true negative rate / specificity). gonna kill all? Kinda sad :( cancel subscription streaming service?   No, couldn't. see about, blatant fear mongering. hope fortunate enough see step away toxic mass hysteria mainstream media. No. people NM shopping East El Paso bad southern NM. even avoided west side town many people Las Cruces go there. reason avoid considering Covid parties Cruces presume is? least like week something. Deaths year date Sweden several countries.

Bullshit. **daily** average *at moment* slightly daily average last 5 years, year date well 5 year average. sound like scared one little bro. Stop crying. worried vaccine effectiveness mutation probably infected 100+ people &amp; I‚Äôve gained much apathy. could give fuck trump-supporting mom‚Äôs care facility gets covid. well-being, can‚Äôt care like more. I‚Äôm glad employer takes seriously state does. gives confidence likely get vaccine get virus. think wacky. Viral recombination happens time. matter fact, novel flu strains typically occur way.

However, whether actually ""threat humans"" remains yet seen. Pandemic flus occur every couple decades. think another novel coronavirus would occur quickly. also found S√∂lvesborg, Sweden source: government guy show positive day, they're self-isolating home right now. fail containing original virus? yeah, there's answer. Dane here. seems like nation sick dealing Covid-19, youth feel like right party (we drink like lot) taking flat care anymore. think even tried bit long. result government structure that's well designed make abrubt hard decisions.

Even think they're suficiently forceful. stands bringing forth stronger quarantine measures *tomorrow* particular region. 

Man. hope going ok. They're already setting sequel season finale, writer's think next? ferret might kill you, everyone know. Tuesday, government received note Statens Serum Institut, exposed mutated coronavirus antibodies. result, according SSI, deeply troubling mutated coronavirus respond well antibodies.
Thus, risk possible vaccine covid-19 desired effect mutated virus mink spreads among humans. be. Germany's, 'lockdown light' began.... I'm already simpleton best could do?

You're looking virology explanation composed historian. Dutch Netherlands Way go Jon, killed country's Mink filthy boots. mutated strand virus means fatal higher death rate? don‚Äôt care farm. spread virus. guys deluded think happened various places already, places capable testing lot people. way stop infectious disease mutate unless put entire fucking world lockdown. could lead delicious, bacon-y smelling fallout cloud large part Europe Russia. Yeah, lets hope sooner. Ripping bandage instead slowly. propagated international media (that nothing done here)

Can show single example ""international media"" saying *nothing* done Sweden?

I bet can't. initial response covid supress news.

China China go figure! like China's government, agreed! can't control China's government, control ourselves, country's initial response ignore it, say gonna fine, it'll go away, go lives, masks work, lockdowns unnecessary, like flu, we've turned corner, worry, vaccine ready election day, etc. losing response. complete failure are. Good just.. dumb guess *wow* likely burnt. avoid spreading...  don‚Äôt need give counterpoint. aren‚Äôt disputing facts, you‚Äôre calling reporting facts ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù you‚Äôre scared child apparently lol mean end 2020 *Season 1*. next thing know, everyone literate, educated, doctor. Slippery slope sure!  Fur animals skin, hes sarcastic saying likes wear human leather doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs right Coronaviruses still infect people despite immune response. lot evasion mechanisms, also observed SARS-CoV-2.

One reasons China went ballistic faced novel coronavirus. believe gas them. people killing handling mink would wearing hazmat suits avoid infection. easy kill many short amount time though, they're kinda struggling. authoritarian regime contain it, even zero regards populations welfare. I'm doubtful better. future kids take history exams 2020. even pigs rights either. evil country socialist capitalists. Exactly. Thanks!

Also China responsible way. part OSN therefore responsible worlds security. (it's simple that) No. could good bad news. Chances mink version virus could lot **less** deadlier, necessarily deadly. deadly, however... Yeah like restated facts knew didn‚Äôt give actual counterpoint lol  Mass spontaneous die offs observed number animal populations population density breaches certain threshold long enough. Sincerely hoping turn one surprising would it? True can‚Äôt hard recommend DIY reusable mask alternative. N95 makes sense someone negative around someone positive. That‚Äôs say exact opposite said masks. Part job honest people misleading cover ass happens shortage something need didn‚Äôt make time. also doesn‚Äôt help stockpile masks expired started prepping SARS set back further. Dane: I've never heard it. might true. shit old people eat disgusting. can't fix stupid! Yep Literarily Vacination close ""around corner"" BAM vaccine immune new covid mutation -.-

&amp;#x200B;

it feels like shitty simulation game evil player controlling random events Source? I‚Äôm implying anything. article saying possibility. It‚Äôs already spread humans they‚Äôre killing entire mink population well locking certain areas. isn‚Äôt fear mongering report facts. you‚Äôre afraid want live safe vaccine bubble means nothing. Exactly. watch closely. Keep mind, it‚Äôs could become increasingly difficult find/follow info. countries wouldn‚Äôt exactly want word get new dangerous (deadlier, transmissible, axes previous vaccine/treatment research since Jan, whatever could be) spreading.

What don‚Äôt quite understand, given fact quickly easily find worrisome mutations globally, protocol place immediate lockdown hundreds miles epicenter country-wide mutation identified ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù, really maybe 0.01% could be. Plus hyper-aggressive contact tracing immediately find isolate may exposed.

You‚Äôre absolutely playing fire new mutation begins spreading quickly little far worse stands... allow spread.

We always one mutation away everything changing direction don‚Äôt want think about. Odds low. increase virus spreads human human (winter fuels that) across species back humans like minks seagulls area.

Not sounding alarms, still much don‚Äôt know. exactly stuff need watching everything else. I‚Äôd assume very, people understand also implications something new emerge. ... know politicians (including ones ostensibly scientists) never lie.

What say actually tell different stories. Right start obvious Swedish authorities trying stop virus spreading. even openly stated trying stop spreading, slow down.

Given possible result virus continuing spread ""herd immunity"" (excluding total annihilation population), strategy based stopping spread is, default, herd immunity strategy - even authors strategy refuse admit it. :D :D :D False! NM anything hit leisure travelers Texas. Given early initial spread was, likely. Even one case could infect entire regions left unchecked.


It would delay rest world gets it. Given **well** 3 months heads warning, doubt 5 months heads would lead better conclusion. weren't. mostly exporting fur China. meat worthless.

There's good argument made industry closed many years ago, affects lot people lot jobs. reason US still building coal power plants. Oh man, Jedi going feel one. Shocked face  Yup. Netherlands al mink farms closed beginning next year. many infections minks humans back mutation rates virus minks disturbing.

It's minks though. also problem farm animals kept fur China. also human-animal infections virus mutates fast animals. 'eternal lockdowns', mind asking.

Can say lockdown conditions centers', refer medical facilities meant take care sick &amp; elderly, mean - enough.

Places sent *positive*. sick, right? positive test result doesnt mean sick. 

[Inside Darwin quarantine camp, life 'like holiday' people escaping Zealand forcing COVID-19 patients ‚Äòquarantine facilities,‚Äô health chief 'travel passes'? quick google gets ""A free travel pass privilege certain class passengers use public transport service without paying fare presenting ticket. global travel trade return pre-pandemic levels, travelers need secure verifiable way document health status travel cross mandatory vaccines mandatory vaccines pretty sure mandatory, nobody knock front door vaccinate you.

No. much talk school, workplace, travel restrictions dont take vaccine.

I mean obviously stuff conspiracy people talking about, tea muffins either. 100% that. Get really FIFA Ultimate Team you‚Äôll love it. I'm disgusted. never knew Danes never forgive them. mean stressing vaccine effectiveness? covered weren‚Äôt satisfied. Again, job make feel better little boy nitpick one situations distinction actually matters: Covid-19 (**CO**rona **VI**rus **D**isease **19**) name disease sick humans experience, later identified virus shown cause disease humans, technically referreed SARS-CoV-2 (**S**evere **A**cute **R**espiratory **S**yndrome **Co**ronoa **V**irus **2**). SARS-CoV-2, informally ""the corona virus"", large family mostly-not-dangerous corona viruses, may mutate trigger creation antibodies, ""Covid-19"" collection symptoms humans may experience virus infects them. China testing COVID Jan, Europe busy testing, US busy banning testing.

If Europe US test, saying posted last November, COVID 19

The fact mutation happened Europe, place virus lost containment, herd immunity Sweden right next door, means we'll get repeat COVID19, without falsely blaming China part. Denmark get contained. 

Most countries dumb USA. wondering mink killed, inside information. danish military branch ""Beredskabsstyrelsen"" handling operations around mink farms. 

An old friend mine, currently serving Beredskabsstyrelsen, says brigade gassing minks 18 hours day. measure civilized world idiocy country. :( Europeans lot cognizant issues fellow Americans are, least, often value well-being world's people personal preferences. headline changed 85% people contract covid worn face mask point lives. necessarily GOT covid. they‚Äôve worn type mask least lifetime. downvoted right taxes go MIT?

BLT.20.265892
By John P Ioannidis

This researcher denotes case-mortality rate 0.23%, even lower. produce studies providing indications long-term effects, data that, please put here. truly hope read non-sarcastic, I'd love corrected. 

Anyway, 0.23% case mortality indications, find hard agree harsh lockdowns. 

I edit original comment final clause clearer read. Dunno kind mink is, they're generally kilo body mass. Cremating human body apparently 90 180 minutes (according UK resource googled up), split difference 135 cremate ~70kg (european average human body mass). 

Assuming pile dead minks acts human body, they're big minks, got average throughput half mink per minute per cremation furnace. 

According [this random website Denmark 20 crematoria, presumably least 1 furnace each. That's 10 minks minute, puts 17 million 1.7 million minutes, 3.2 years.

Presumably they're gonna find make more, they're probably gonna press-gang 20 human crematoria country helping, y'know. Maybe they'll start big open fire Coronavirus-riddled rodent carcasses. still 2020, weirder shit's happened. statement clearly cities, regions; sub-thread fact Swedes live densely rather spreading regions. ignored comparing regions instead cities specifically make Stockholm appear less dense; since Stockholm region 3.5 times size Copenhagen region cities urban areas similar size.

You looking ways ""win"" competion created. Could please stop misrepresenting severity situation Sweden compared Denmark. Could imagine? rush finish vaccine, get public, strain mink covid comes vaccine found make infection lethal. 

I'm really getting worried covid19 variants might become endemic. fear mongering. It‚Äôs non issue now. higher ups aware, news; need stress moment. Haha haha!! Misinformation? Maybe check news Sweden looked Spring. really hoping herd immunity solve problem first seroprevalence results Stockholm came in. Giesecke even wrote Besides Sweden, UK NL also herd immunity-based strategy beginning, something unheard of. Yep. They‚Äôll see competitors sacrificing try make money haha absolutely correct. mink strain demonstrated spread human human. Even does, might lower rate regular COVID, may die naturally due low rate spread. 
Even spread high rate, lockdown measures may sufficient eliminate virus left Denmark.  

Even spread among global population high rate, unlikely deadly COVID currently (according Danish report). worst case scenario need second vaccine - hopefully resources expertise we've built current strain COVID would hasten process mink strain something solved via vaccine 

""end world"" one scenarios. Well maybe get paid two vaccine trials now, cool. guess Oh sorry. Thank you. :) Members mink family (mustelid) carry, catch pass colds similar humans much easily dogs cats. able give COVID back forth really surprising. literally recited it. Like wrote perfectly. cried man  know, I'm Aspie, overanalyze things, am, despite best efforts, really hard keep Sane, maybe take break sub. know else increases risks complications? Advanced maternal age. Maternal death, premature birth, chromosomal abnormalities go dramatically. may well less risky baby COVID 30‚Äôs wait 40‚Äôs. also real possibility isn‚Äôt really going get better, long time least. suggest people give many one thing want life something much disagree with. know tigers got infected Bronx zoo didn‚Äôt infect anyone. made point counterpoint, grow little baby troll inb4 china says Denmark patient zero 3...2..1 Heartbreaking see, poor family. TIL mink farms world, including US. hilarious man LOL give counterpoint btw fuck uses fur 2020 Stop cruelty animals shit could probably already mutated fuck ton times already. one knows theres wandering strain farm India similar mutations. Point is, stupid bet vaccine viruses mutate continue mutate like flu. least get vaccine actually works common strain, take long alter specific vaccine strains like flu shots, no? ‚ÄúEven though death rate young people minimal, subject restrictions since they‚Äôre spreading it‚Äù

‚ÄúYoung people can‚Äôt get vaccine old people!‚Äù

Just admit it‚Äôs stopping spread. matter what, young people going lose. live gerontocracy whatever preserve generations power expense young people. let virus already see trump talking it:

The radical left want shut mink farms! can‚Äôt let happen great farmers! Tremendous animals minks, fantastic things economy. Can‚Äôt let happen! long mammal unreasonably angry probably mustelid. No! mink outside walls eat seaweed instead. Yo can‚Äôt freak news stories posted without really looking context.

There interesting things could indicator significant issues mutation like become dominant vaccine... but... gotta chill.

People radical reactions things here, life really. wall around Denmark dont let anyone ~~in~~ out. believe sale Crazy Coat King New Jersey planned, though. Damn joking yesterday saying need new plague top Covid-19 get rid antimaskers all. 

I kidding yall. That‚Äôs going phrase anything goes wrong rest lives.  think press conference said new measures announced tomorrow. Oh bollocks, live harbour town, Herring Gulls Great Black Backs place. Well that's happens genetically similar organisms reproduce, get twisted, horrible offspring.

Then mutants start playing mud dig dinosaur virus.  Hi yes I'm looking coat make look 30 years older ... problem almost never doctor go ""oh, around cat? must source covid infection"", like documented infection food, infection feces, etc., way knowing really unless obvious case CDC says ""I unno"" order cause panic. 

Cats get covid, symptomatic, minimum transmit cats I'm assuming humans get well (although obviously less viral load compared large animal). doctor going say someone got covid cat unless absolutely exposure anything cat known covid, odds that? i'm sure figure social media. Main stream media report carefully false information discredit them. Small media platforms willing make risk, therefore reporting news less filter may may accurate information. sick bat could eating fruit, drops pig pen, pig eats it, gets sick.

This assumes interspecies transmission. mink, knew mink history, would happy. 0 doubt would like fuck keep wanted outs

ousts It‚Äôs going start winding spring, vaccines start popping people stop giving shit. Summer pretty much normal sense coronaviruses naturally die people spend lot time outside. Fall bad memory. Okay thank you, saved life, \*this\* close stabbing myself. theory seagulls carried mink farms. Danes capable understand gravity situation tho. TIL still thriving fur industries 2020. Guess checks rest year. ....I say did. Literally said 'if option'. defensive? wouldn‚Äôt be!

It‚Äôs noteworthy killing minks result. mutation bad situation spread efficiently human human D614G mutation overtake dominance.

This realllllllly big leap say that. won‚Äôt even wear masks, so... :( want know people thinks end Biden elected. end way surprised. Shit like create baby boom. China right treating civilization level threat, countries failed suffer consequences very, long time. Well horrifying multiple reasons US equivalent would 7600 deaths per day.  yes none mutations affect antibody response significantly

this mink woke Soho bar, policeman knew name think accusation Biden wins literally stop covering media. brings many questions Oh. please stop farming eating animals fucks sake. can't believe huge debate yet since covid started. F*ck Trump. nothing prevent this. coulda better. Bad 2020 bad! ...And somehow integrate SSRIs them. Fuck. zombie movie starts... Excellent point. SARS much simpler contain. Jup! Ah, see, person Indonesia, worried, right? ‚ÄúSo Hitler bad guy gonna allow new, potentially damaging virus spread infect millions actual people favor animal?‚Äù (Ugh liking logic making point)

We would like save minks else would deal situation quickly effectively enough? scary, predicted consequence widespread human infection. really bad part antibodies work it. virus mutate europe? cold? Keep mind pile minks drastically greater surface area burn faster result. let‚Äôs hope best Mink farms

That's every region. country. state minister told monday option first. since outbreaks started farms summer they've careful quarantines. Birds seems likely explanation. Well wait 2000 people dying every day want mutated plague carrying Mink?  MMCOV-2020 Still name calling like twat? Pretty stressed, sounds like. go ahead admit know I‚Äôm old bc getting schooled middle schooler beyond embarrassing /u/blazingsaint means going shit again, guarantee one care next summer. People tired already refuse listen recommendations. healthcare worker, would change job quickly possible. Utah, many European countries well hitting really high numbers right now. really. know anything pathogenesis. thing spread asymptotically like sarscov2 does, would much easier contain. know say. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make right. friend proof lol Ya guess doesn‚Äôt become dominant all... dominant enough able rage population like dominant strain does.

Also, understand, spike protein pretty important transmission. it‚Äôs affected, seems like would challenges becoming caused problems.

Point being, long way go ton things fuck something causes real problems people.

Coronavirus crazy unique mix infectious deadly. cut either infectiousness deadliness, becomes less problem. 

From understand, D614G spike proteins original, spreads still able attacked antibodies. 

I think worst case scenario happened much, expect right now, truth seems highly unlikely issue. Wow. kids (who absolutely phenomenal, way) see mom dad go work every day help people. think patients work believe career good use time, surely know best. 

And right, teach kids values. learn multiple perspectives, different traditions, varying points view. learn mom dad might leave always come back. learn trust adults care them. 

The bad thing movement towards female equality opened floodgates judgy, holier thou women like tell working moms everything wrong. totally support woman wants full time parent. zero input clearly understanding anyone feels differently. Sorry think women babies run household (and yes, that's value happily pass daughter, son's) Danish Kid china: ""Mom get Covid?""

Danish mom: ""We covid home"" *\*sunglasses emoji\** Government mandates primary driver people staying home, subsequent hit economy. People stayed home volition. thought market knew best?  facebook.com Turns humans virus whole time 

Bottom text Without hundreds thousands tests everyday really hard control. it? know anything Netherlands situation - know killed mink too, know theorized spread there, claim to. also think virus jumping danish netherlands mink populations - that'd odd. 

To best knowledge:

Humans spread Covid globally.

Covid jumps human mink, denmark netherlands. countries start culling mink.

In denmark, virus mutates jumps BACK humans, resistant.

In netherlands, (yet). Obviously. come something that's effective detecting worldwide virus, that's something taxes probably cover. know, general health people. decent country world would. 

Yes get money. people pay full price it. /u/blazingsaint also one lol I‚Äôm laughing ass atm Chinese. 60% mink furs exported china.

The situation regarding corona infection among mink developed critical stage North Jutland.

Right inside government offices, situation categorized serious talk coronavirus 2.0.

Therefore, government decided mink herds must killed coronavirus mutated among mink spread humans.

This Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says press conference Wednesday.

‚ÄúYou lose life's work, cases inherited several generations. day sorrow work mink profession. government aware this, ""says Mette Frederiksen mink breeders. 

A mutated coronavirus spread mink humans since spread strongly among citizens North Jutland.

On Tuesday, government received note Statens Serum Institut (SSI), exposed mutated coronavirus antibodies.

The result, according SSI, deeply troubling mutated coronavirus respond well antibodies.

Thus, risk possible vaccine covid-19 desired effect mutated virus mink spreads among humans.

At time, concern new coronavirus mink means people infected corona affected mutated coronavirus.

There also new restrictions way citizens number municipalities northern Jutland stop spread coronavirus mink.

So far, municipalities Hj√∏rring, Frederikshavn, Br√∏nderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted L√¶s√∏, Mette Frederiksen informs.

¬ªWe know well leave North Jutland uncertainty tomorrow. sorry that. must act now. life death Denmark, whole world, ""says Mette Frederiksen.

The new restrictions announced Thursday.

Since government received worrying note SSI Tuesday, government offices working hard find restrictions needed.

The coronavirus spread rapidly Danish mink farms since summer. time writing, 207 mink herds diagnosed corona, therefore minks must killed.

But order Mette Frederiksen mink 1,100 mink farms Denmark must killed. be, since new strain different characteristics found virus follicles fur itself, wanted sure. carcasses turned heating electricity instead. hear you. can, theory , kill animal without pain. However, think makes act killing morally acceptable. definition word ‚Äúhumane‚Äù is: ‚Äúhaving showing compassion benevolence‚Äù. Killing animals necessity wrong. someone murdered sleep, humane? Well it‚Äôs peer reviewed hasn‚Äôt commentary it. mutations extensively studied.

There many unanswered questions require sort critical analysis. There‚Äôve comments actual danger transmission. even raised eyebrow terms actual effect pandemic save proactive measures government taking.

So far, talk context mink extermination, happened countries. actual hell read? Mink rats, they're even rodents. remember original black plague people massively dying from.... mutation it.

If remember right.

Edit: [I remembered virus (aka God) kills sinners. /s Thanks admitting you‚Äôre wrong finally lol Absolutely, end ""vaccines going come next year"" mentality, take containment much seriously. public ready though, happen. pandemic going drag long time. numbers since Friday indeed significantly lower initial predictions. new lockdown announced, government expecting would peak 30k end week. However, even hit 20k yet, fingers crossed starting stabilise Research paper asymptomatic cancer patient shedding virus 70  SARS-CoV-2 infection shedding immunocompromised patient  SARS-CoV-2 isolated 70 days post diagnosis  within-host genetic variation continuous turnover viral variants  SARS-CoV-2 isolates display altered replication Thanks. Gottlieb failed statistics class teacher Trump'd graduated.

Since day one, consistent range deaths, mortality, 2%. That's stunningly flat.

When one increases number infections, mortality numbers increase. 

In past 4 months, US, daily new virus infections increased 100%! 

So, guess what, Gottlieb-Trump. body count doubled. 

And here's big question small mind insults us CNBC: death rate remain flat? 

Get outta here. lmaoo okay guy. Whatever u say. great way stay shape clusterf-ck! Already setting 2021. answer? call names? thanks.

I eaten meat life. dead yet, according definition?

Maybe must superhuman.

Or maybe wrong. everyone took seriously, Covid issue right now. hard contain. widespread infection city almost eradicated it, 2 weeks lockdown people common sense afterwards. Testing tracing great, people still care understand, places open yet, alright. spreads people think ""I'm 75+, go back normal, 0 precautions me"". attitude spreads like wildfire. Lol think one human worth 20 million living creatures? Stupid fuck ‚ÄúUntil washes ‚Äú ... then? Mink farming done. It‚Äôs coming back. moral imperative increase survival reduce suffering. end, killing animals sustenance survival also moral imperative.

Anything beyond luxury doesn‚Äôt change basic fact. already Denmark. late November worst ""flu"" I've ever had, doctor said mild ""sore throat"", really felt like shit. Everytime get sick lasts least week half, time gone around four five days later, blue. kind weird chest-ache month. Pretty weird stuff. I've wondering time actually Covid. It‚Äôs tragedy hope move toward end mink farms. 

After reading lot today, fucked things inhumane. original virus China communist. unfair say economic system responsible. Animals exact thing animals lol. Ppl even understand morals nowadays. think consuming meat humanely immoral cheating spouse not. Honestly I'm 100% done humanity. Tuesday, government received note Statens Serum Institut, exposed mutated coronavirus antibodies. result, according SSI, deeply troubling mutated coronavirus respond well antibodies.

WHICH antibodies?

Because mutations reduce efficacy monoclonal antibodies already observed would really significant news.

Lack neutralizing activity convalescent plasma shown react strongly reference samples virus would time panic, would true antibody escape mutation.

I'm kind thinking former, specifically they're yelling clearly latter, probably newspaper creating sensationalistic headlines. Thank sharing that! mink trapper, think would great. Wild fur ethical sustainable source clothing is, mink farms basically destroyed wild fur market. immunity form Covid-19 work new mutation. Also vaccines waiting also. cutting new mutation prevent new pandemic. Theres mink genocide wow white people theyre gay Young healthy people. Get straight 2020 jaded main event named 2019. Threw us Covid-20 mink? Denmark Mink Plague

Covid bad. would good name band. There‚Äôs nothing immoral killing consuming animals. Slaughterhouses aside, it‚Äôs way ‚Äúhumane‚Äù caring hunt quickly kill animals. kind death lot less painful one nature would give otherwise.

Animals would us given chance. Could fault them? We‚Äôre trying survive. mostly workers receiving many packages stock open shift. going much higher risk someone bringing one two frozen packages home. Meanwhile Denmark ""can't shit Detroit"" mode mink strain... like read wrote. 

You literally wrote malabsorption issue means norm humans, humans absoli cannot live completely without meat.

That's objectively demonstrably false, though. There's shortage humans exactly that. 

Like, debate, they're alive. take hormonal birth control, known increase chances blood clots. I‚Äôm thinking contract covid stop taking altogether? risk goes longer taken it, taken 3 years. 
I‚Äôm everything get sick! Well going retire happily anyways. think many animals killed every day meat industry. google hit says 25 million chickens killed every day USA. r/ people volunteer vaccines? Ahh yes, Danish flu. Good find killing souls even feel it. empathy. include wild minks ones farms? thought herd immunity stuff. care virus mutated? gt 66% people infected. kill mink? call baby aspirin kids arent supposed take aspirin (Reyes syndrome). 81 mg tablets. Worst worst case loose 1% world population covid, end civilisation. dramatic functional government

A now? clotting well-known while, I've found singular case study sub specific type antibodies. thought newer study would interesting people know. mean call COVID-19 PRC Virus now? Im even asking change, I'm asking show little empathy, can't even that! massive hypocrite right now, ask change like read wrote. 
We need meat b12. B12 extremely important brain function. Lack b12 causes lose ability walk amongst many things. know first hand. tablets barely anything. would subject everyone suffering getting b12 shot every weeks literally consume meat humane way?
I'm supporting inhumane slaughter animals consumption meat. need meat part balanced diet. literally proven. Like stop. I'm experiencing first hand. doctors experienced first hand. 
A celebrity, Liam Hemsworth, literally got sick meat diet. choose veganism vegetarianism that's fine. humans absolutely cannot live completely without meat. help unhealthy city (awful diets, high obesity rate) big drinking city (source: lived 25 years) Circulating neutralizing antibodies necessary sterilizing immunity herd immunity.

Memory B-cells active need activated CD4+ lympocytes start producing neutralizing antibodies again. CD4+ CD8+ T-lympocytes recognize antigen-mhc complexes surfaces infected cells. means kick B-cell T-cell mediated immune responses absence neutralizing antibodies, cells need become infected virus needs replicating host, means host needs get sick there's immune response. sterilizing immunity cleans pathogens cells even infected. symbiotic like every virus? whats point literally look multiple sources, sounds stupid. Every day reaffirms sort hell. Europe botched handling coronavirus badly. Ever since learned minks mink farms received mutation COVID-19 slaughtered prevent spread humans, thought entire mink population would go extinct prevent spread. also even know mutation minks would lot deadlier humans previously.

So mink population fine, especially wild? humans regard new strain COVID-19 found minks? deadlier humans previously? Damn El Paso liberal city texas next Austin... Hell closer california Houston.. (source: lived 25 years) initially responded someone mentioning gassing pigs, cats, dogs assumed referring that. know minks culled, I'm sure agree would humane farm animals first place fur.

edit: realised original user replying to! Well, 77 billion land animals killed every year food, etc. Like mink fur, people, meat much unnecessary luxury item -we eat tastes good.

Cows pigs might cute minks, cute, smarter expect.  No, I‚Äôm saying going compare covid deaths flu deaths using metrics, case. probably concerning sounds. would ask read thread, getting desperate: Well, fuck much 2020 say, reading I'm hot spot actually stings little. I'm happy guys, like single bridesmaid toasts newly married friend. outbreak furgeson wrongly predicted many many people would die. followed shit too. reads like satire actually real. surprisingly well optimized humans compared original SARS alreasdy 9000+ Argentina Colombia yet report. Abolishing mink farms already scheduled 2024 Netherlands. Corona accelerated that. mink farms must closed march 2021. tragedy minks go people reading governments taking seriously taking drastic action listening scientists early instead thinking sign end times. Likewise writing?

You send SL Tribune. Someone Tribune Reddit account. Someone Fox13 SLC, too. forecast 100,000+ deaths it.

\*136,000 *cases* projected upper limit. actually got 177

It's almost though active measures employed limit spread, eh?

As matter fact, seems exactly comment replying explicitly detailed. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø absolute rubbish. New Zealand health response drawn heavily lessons Taiwan - Director General Public Health, Ashley Bloomfield, explicit specific this. conditions going get aerosolized poop animals workers breathing lungs.

This also likely coronavirus jumped bats humans, likely workers collecting bat guano caves breathing aerosolized bat feces.

A trace fecal contamination groceries aerosolized going breathe in, might get hand need get lungs upper sinuses. eat enzymes mouth digestive system shred virus. viral dose also low. Plus, virus lasts substantial amount time smooth surfaces (metal, plastic), poop smooth surface. restrictions? they've done issue strong advisories. Yes? Yes. Name *ten* mink farmers... think shocking normal Americans substantial mink farms still operation given ppl wear fur. think alpaca ostrich farm ppl would shrug since specialty herds. would miracle hit 10k/day 2nd wave coming Europe ... Hope Qld opens borders now. Hoping spend Christmas Melbourne. asked thing. article day said aspirin may help. I'm doctor take advise definitely speak doctor covid positive benefits, negatives adding aspirin regimen. Save 2021  don‚Äôt disagree necessarily, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough information know information, especially patient clinical improvement. instance, even follow serial PTT PT CRP whatever, point offer anticoagulation? long follow for? frequently? risk actually correlate markers, causing harm good?

That‚Äôs there‚Äôs much discussion far anticoagulation, easy test know who‚Äôs risk. 

Just curiosity, medical field seeing routine coagulation labs followed? known months. virus huge coagulation problem. collect Danish mink farmer trading cards. many people don‚Äôt care unless directly effects them. Gotta learn hard way usual guess. see like mink outside box. Speciesism nature, propaganda. Though similarly rape murder also nature. whether one day killing animals pleasure eating becomes socially unacceptable rape murder interesting open question. ""humane"", word ironic?

Fuck humane. weirdest part me, cuz grandmother‚Äôs furs (not much now, coats made alive), *sooooo* dated. They‚Äôre even cut style could considered ‚Äútimeless‚Äù classic, don‚Äôt think would wear even wanted risk public. think actually made way several protocols. contract it, plan start right away daily aspirin.

I also plan take single dose Ivermectin.

In addition, plan bump Vitamin D, Zinc, Quercitin, NAC, Vitamin C much higher levels currently taking. Utah's ICU capacity 74.9% based physical number beds, problem enough healthcare workers handle filling beds. trying convince retired nurses help trying recruit personnel states, far sound like much luck. WTF. burning even seem anything cause suffering. thought burning, figured big furnace turned full on, insta-dead. severely abuse. Less lethal blessing curse Coronavirus, whole point particularly lethal, spreads easily cause entire medical system break many patients. causes less deaths hospitalisations insane spread still happen. This. figured, assume d-dimers done covid-19 patients part treatment, would part procedures. way, ass many people. you, Seapigeon?

You course must referring majestic Shit Hawk. Ugh. Like anxiety needed boost.  Flights Europe land BC day every day.  countries wouldn‚Äôt exactly want word get out

I steered car straight conspiracy cliff Jesus man, said ""fine"" suggesting suppressing virus destroyed economy nothing. clearly case keep head sand keep shifting goal posts. actual figures back claims rather feelings.

Let make bold prediction making unsubstantiated claims, are. potential bounce Q3 wiped Q4 particularly US current surging numbers.

Uncontrolled virus != booming economy. obtuse disingenuous suggesting otherwise. There's mink rotten *the State* Denmark. Well like Danish mink farmers willing either. yeah guys always little bit late. let smoke one seeüòÖ  That‚Äôs relief. I‚Äôll sure avoid minks normally hang with. changes PT predict risk thrombus I. Covid patients? understanding PT often slightly elevated covid patients, haven‚Äôt seen good data particular lab tests predict thrombosis risk well. guidelines lie seen recommend anticoagulation based clinical risk factors non hospitalized patients. yet. Praying contagiousness less original strain. number tests conducted partial count. Tests conducted private institutions don‚Äôt get added tally 1-2 days typically. Positives get added immediately. represent others going die maybe tell photo? Ok, sherlock. want play Sims DLC anymore way state well west coast Time put end fur industry. It‚Äôs cruel begin with. right, half life antibodies covid 70 days so, 8 months long detectable test took. guys relatively strict lockdown curfew? police control anything

working switzerland living france, must say appreciate freedom switzerland compared France french side border covid bad worse even find teeny tiny blue specks/beads plastic dryer lint trap occasionally it‚Äôs freaking out. Definitely detergent (it‚Äôs clear), must something wash, can‚Äôt figure they‚Äôre coming far. don‚Äôt like idea putting micro-plastics water supply, I‚Äôve worked hard eliminate known products life. means another wave rule world right? 

without mass testing countries get rid virus. slowenia found mire 25.000 infected people. germany example says this. wrong. wirhout mass testing way stop it. look China did. sure act different infections hole city got tested quarantine striked quarantine. way go germany never ending story... difference catch flue sick home. ~80% symptoms spread around... like said mass testing would save us also means mass quarantine... ask question etic way rules world, money... parent college student, don‚Äôt understand left alone. would never trust ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre young‚Äù opinion even risk 0.0001% fatality esp. one hospital emergency visit. least provide teledoc, check-in buddy, monitor, something. Blood clots seem issue younger people - friend one released hospital due Covid - immediately went back ICU. may felt discouraged go hospital hard breathe. local hospital overwhelmed, I‚Äôd go pick up. seems unsettling avoidable. different COVID-19 would named based year discovered reported. COVID-19 reported December 31. wasn‚Äôt named COVID-20 year almost over. looking triggered person... I'm person trying constantly argue multiple people flawed arguments.

Your numbers match found internet. density Stockholm supported, somehow double density Copenhagen. someone else pointed out, ignored them. Care provide sources? figured, since heard much since then. Thank Sure, baby troll. Grow fucking serious? would seriously risk another pandemic lives 20 million minks infected mutated version Covid

The minks getting killed fur coats anyway understand comment funny something like 0.000000001% world population right? info contagion factor increased death rate? think humans dont make mistakes exhausted pandemic lasted longer due dumb dirt garbage humans? Nope never started calling child yeah root I'm wrong lol. Corona virus 2 electric boogaloo live?  makes sense. Thank Sounds like blame game Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely animal abuse cruelty. eating animals secretions. hope whole virus draws attention abuses cruelties factory farming encourages people make ethical choice stop consuming them, whether fur, meat, milk, parts. guns resourceful vikings, we'll find way ;) Haha real life crisis like scary Spider-Man alien month, right? people still vote him? I'm even US heard died last month. vote dead person? one else ballot? people pay zero attention vote beyond party lines? even 17 million minks? Fur fucking stupid. Damn 2020, back bullshit strain. going start reporting testing strain. clear two key strains one really bad. tiny tiny country central europe 26 different cantons minuscule 4 different languages different cultures political rules respective covid, 8.5 million people vs. super conglomerate blob 330 million people size continent, massive differences testing policies

&amp;#x200B;

at point apple pears apples watermelons comparing Diff person here, said 12 infected earlier news. idea  dad mates gone drinks tonight night lockdown comes effect tomorrow. probably 100,000s people tonight. Ugh. We're definitely going hit 1k/day soon; weeks ago certain even break 100/day 10 day!

Can election least go completely bad, otherwise it'll cap totally horrible 2020. They're 1,200 deaths day Trumps covid approval rating among Republicans like 90%. Huff.  food suffice, right? become pandemics yes. masters letting small outbreaks become pandemics. agree that? TIL, thanks! Awesome!!! Thank much. know I'll taking get covid (a likely scenario, unfortunately) Denmark crazy like shit. Stop bastards!!!! gas them, eat them... Bulgarian hospital system defunded past 30 years, new specialists running hills, aka Western country them. Netherlands we're still waiting 5 months close mink farms. ‚Äúsweet trailer‚Äù supposed show entire movie? Never mind sensitivity movie trailer I‚Äôd rather intrigued movie every major event shown neighbour mink farmer, iirc freezes furs part process, would hazard guess kills virus well.

I believe timing bad though, yet full winter furs. Definitely better safe sorry! may joking. surveillance chip may not. Im willing bet they'll burn waste disposal plants. Generally tests sewer (the humans) show presence viral RNA. RNA remains long virus rendered inert und unable infect cells. test shown RNA present doesn‚Äôt automatically mean infect way. son jon johnson grandson johnjonson I'm pretty sure answer tomorrow affected areas Denmark handled. source lockdown claim? I'm Denmark can't find source statement Maybe receive nice slice Intel Bold move Cotton, let‚Äôs see comment plays lol Congratulations fooling lot people. started insulting me. Calling child . 

I responded returning insults. I‚Äôm sick attitude, reason slightest cordial you. You‚Äôre still wrong. still don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre wrong. still attempt make seem wrong calling troll agree you. You‚Äôre loser, simple. agree. feel like Illinois big, suburbs detached rest state, everyone feels like people's problems ignoring 8%+ positivity rates zip codes. seeded everywhere, right people let guards down. election taking lead news, growing stats viewed ""just numbers"" people. allowing virus spread even faster. uneducated (myself) websites would recommend following things closely? reason think Danish civil war would decided rock skipping.  hope END Mink Farming.

Sorry, cruel industry go! I‚Äôm speculating think Moderna mRNA vaccine could potentially antigen replaced parts new variant; delivery system, it‚Äôs production development issue Everyone says bad news, is, completly preventable. farm animals drastically reduce often humans come contact (pig, cow, mink, pangolin). pandemic could happened.
[
Plus look cute guys (not sure use particular mink) Yes no. meaningful way. I've already elaborated point replies commenters thread, I'll refer instead repeating myself. always dry ones make blow air nose problem still minks probably many infected NL right?  right assume Covid-19 antibodies don‚Äôt respond virus vaccines testing would ineffective mutation? mutation slips Denmark‚Äôs containment efforts spreads around world mean would develop another vaccine strain? redevelop current vaccine? Either way news troubling.  Why? :( hate 2020 going need lock whole country, specific regions. way count people going regions visiting, shopping, w/e.

Given little people listen States, cannot risked. vaccines supposedly coming soon front line workers cannot new strain spread around world forcing us another year shit, cannot.

Let's give money need help them, pass relief citizens next thing agenda Congress, ensuring Denmark get easily help spare world insane bullshit. risk sounding dumb, China bats/pangolins? prevalent animals wild, vs thousands minks captivity (resembling human factory outbreaks)? reported? nice taste? 100% gives chance bring others misery..sad nothing new. Yeah even though fucking sucks agree harsh measures probably got time, new mutation likely first appeared Denmark. link support claims. meaning link another article? title copy pasted article, edited all. trouble breathing panic attack doctor still made get ct scan make sure nothing going heart lungs covid. arbitrary rules put place motive behind them. Airline companies can't without income, woman giving birth alone, despite much lower risk public health. No. don‚Äôt.

Our supplies thin, definitely enough get winter. Believe want. wife around positive cases covid 19 2.5 weeks. 15 days ago first person showed fever. left immediately.

Instead have? can't tell amount idiocy seen around people close me. Going around shopping public travel positive test resutls + symptoms + mask, going vacations multiple countries catching disease, coming back partying going bars etc. 400+ people weddings 130 infected, 200 people birthday parties 60 infected. Thousands people thinking disease made-up. Millions thinking big deal open 100% let old people die.

List goes near-infinity. Enjoy life Korea can. Western world well 2025. expecting close proximity humans mink, thank clarification üôÇ Yeah sure would know eventually virus already broken out, like got info China COVID-19 early January research suggests around since October 2019.

Or proposing check every covid-19 patient blood clots, even ones go ICU? Quick, tell doctor, check them. GO tests, proportionally fewer deaths. Great. Got nothing said, deaths lag cases.

No claiming statistically significant correlation, could measure via coefficient. I've said like 4x OP comment thread set topic. 

I know rambling now. shit deaths lag cases. think die COVID get linked current case data said correlate increased deaths.

I liked literally _the entire COVID dataset United States since started tracking data_. asserted correlation. linked peer reviewed research math. backing say ""I never claimed correlation, 'deaths lag cases'"". Yeah again, shit deaths lag cases. talking stats making generic misrepresented said.

No can't pick lane.

Plus, get see long terms effects virus do; I've seen fairly worrying projections. completely right, point may accept new reality live it. totally understand what's said. vaccine sorts main variant Covid now, would think mutation accounted forms vaccine needed Bingo.

Also, none info peer reviewed even public all. somebody's mutation perk loaded Plague Inc China fucking careful open information.  confuse Switzerland Sweden? really hope so. Thanks knowledge! 1. misrepresented said.

2020 violent longer expect good news mutated Covid mink.

Such bright future. closing border hotspot NSW now? /s I'm trying grasp R value drop 1 we're still seeing increasing daily case numbers week-on-week every day now. increase _did_ become smaller percentage wise, still increase. come generation time 4 days vs. looking weekly increases (but again, smoothened 7 day R given 0.98 yesterday's report)? so, big would weekly increase R exactly 1? Would linear growth vs. exponential R 1 negative growth R &lt; 1? come ""Nowcasting"" prediction model RKI uses model R date onset illness vs. reporting date cases, guessing future case numbers? 
 
e: think got it. Must relict R 1 changing &lt;= 1. base infect others grown gen-on-gen R 1, following infections still carry growth past, change rules / people's behaviour pushed R 1, still seem number new daily cases keeps growing (because incubation time delays around testing), actually trend R much ahead we're seeing artifacts past. I'm currently going language school Japan.

They saying going ""back normal"" re: covid. 6-7 people pretty small room i.e. social distancing, open windows, properly enforcing masks (zero warning people wearing nose).

They'll take people's temperature, that's that. course largely performative entirely possible contagious yet asymptomatic. also claiming 14 day quarantine period people coming Japan makes safe.

They offering online option either. I'm sure proceed. think that's safe environment continue wearing N95 masks? Cat herders going work soon? HUNDREDS mutations. normal. none like (that seen). ~*~ maybe stop forcing animals confined spaces food luxury ~*~ IDGAF get it. want shit with. many chemicals fur goes through......I think they'd like get paid. unless government helping out. program lol vague specific cracked up. people refuse wearing masks planes indoors, many think GOP? I'm afraid we're level humanity yet. competitive here, tell ya. 
Just kidding. totally ridiculous. Everyone complaining governor trying shut things down, one seems want wear mask, least appropriately. Pray us, heh.

Just wait another couple weeks everyone gets sick voting parties. Thanksgiving.. assume they're safe they're family also ""careful"". takes one person.. Gross there's final excuse needed ban fur farming, incredibly useless vain form animal abuse it. Ban now, completely, worldwide.

Wow. farmer saved money made money. Don‚Äôt kid yourself, another tactic. They‚Äôre together. I'm teacher Arkansas I've got 20 students (teenagers), every 80 minutes. New students added rosters every week kids switch virtual option back classroom. students crowded together classes due lack space coughing, sneezing, blowing noses constantly.  Many pull masks cough sneeze even remind constantly so. Parents getting kids tested symptoms want kids home two weeks. see issues helping numbers go down.... Also healthcare system atrocious people need talk that. good times nurse patient ratio NY 1 nurse 8 patients. CA it‚Äôs 1:4 many days can‚Äôt keep workload. 1:8 putting fires. imagine half staff sick got COVID patients keep rolling in. it‚Äôs 1:16 more. watched video travel nurse went NY surge stories nurses told chilling me. working hospital 15 bed ER one worst nights two nurses 50 patients. People dead sometimes time nurses got needed oxygen. nobody put replace tank. add facility running IV pumps. Running critical meds eye balling drip rate. literally insane. titrate critical drip IV pump sometimes going 8.2cc/hr 11.4cc/hr stuff like that. can‚Äôt eyeball that. NY‚Äôs death rate directly tied poorly hospitals run. Fuck man, best stay safe. Hope class full idiots See 2030! Fake fur gotten properties soft warm desired anyways. cold places soft warm good plastic fur indistinguishable real deal bother real thing? would get serious consequences let virus leave country &amp; spread, good taking seriously  Bror er du vanvittig Jesus christ im tired Let someone touch dog, I'll sitting ass Rice St stop farming poor things?

Prof Francois Balloux

No evidence increased transmissibility recurrent mutations everything fineeeee, guys! /s well long, get complacent. least months respite summer. Wild animals suffer too. Hunger, disease, predation, parasites.
Nature beautiful us we're it, brutal place. seriously scared wonder many going actually die people US start taking seriously. Oh boy can‚Äôt wait Covid-20 Nope , R number 1 sometime probably norm couple weeks lockdown begins mitigate it. Denmark 2.0.. article seems people contact minks gotten infected Covid well. guarantee mishandle new strain well... fml. need vaccine start rolling out. think people need scale back meat consumption fuck ton, done ethically. Gassing animals something like nitrogen makes even realize what's going fall asleep, similar reasons put smell indicators gas cos could pass never know gas leak otherwise.

Although best alternative would 3D printing meat using cell growing techniques, it'd interesting see egg substitute considering arguments textures eggs. die dysentery.  Damn. Sounds like second wave Spanish Flu. scary fk. days past Halloween. Give time. Thx posting Yeah, like animal farms general. found entire country Denmark, dense located right center Europe. time, animals harvested gas. Also, there's moments lives they're killed suffering be, generally is, inflicted. go without mask? love year. Chickens finally coming home roost. election over, votes shouldn‚Äôt count /s Intentional You‚Äôre absolutely correct really isn‚Äôt enough information yet.

As offering anticoagulant initial PTPTT would come back outside normal range really considered. are, like said, lot factors including patient age, sex, diet, medical history, etc. elderly patients tend get low anticoagulants admitted regardless. You‚Äôre likely clot laying hospital bed about. following depends really range initial PTPTT is. You‚Äôd treat monitor long remained problem. geriatrics take blood thinners like warfarin ensure blood becoming thick thin. It‚Äôs delicate balancing act lots blood draws.

I work healthcare laboratory scientist. It‚Äôs really common run kinds tests inpatients, wouldn‚Äôt patients didn‚Äôt need hospitalized. That‚Äôs less worrisome, still great. Try google  Wise listen Carrot. still publicly released alien contact December 2020 card, we‚Äôre good. Winter coming You‚Äôre right, shock realize things bad actually are... eats inside sometimes. sheer numbers animals killed every day without even recognizing death astounding. Hard believe mink fur trade prevalent. Especially since faux fur become lifelike, much cheaper ethical. industry buying virus fur? world discovering Danish animals threat global humanity? Denmark EU Wuhan? deadly less? infectious less? Time build wall around Denmark guess. Sorry guys. Yup every 3rd block. I'm near exit 20 128. disease becomes real thing promptly name ‚Äúminksels‚Äù????? Hahahahahaha fuck guesstimating, would suspect summer unique limited exposure, let things rip. year fairly steady spread, occasional spikes, combined natural seasonality, don‚Äôt think see summer spread again.  go situation would continue treated horribly end fur coat rich asshole

better they're dying good cause imo like Einsatzgruppen Viruses aren‚Äôt symbiotic, they‚Äôre parasites. Symbiotic relationships mutually benefitting newer synthetics keep warmer. What's story here? Backlog dump true 24 hour toll? Ask Hitler. fur trade needs stop. Animal farms general need kill animals sustenance survival day age though. know mink culled human safety, farmed first place. Farming animals necessary, ironically contributing opposite survival creating virus' one biggest contributors planet's destruction. Relax, joke Danish professional footballers. plan pedofilic satanic animal activists! know animal activists working him? Bill Gates! plan insert microchips us stop mink farming business! WAKE Sheeple!!!!! RemindMe! 58 Days long get brazilian bats back humans...

That never happen, even suggest it?

And probably already outside Denmark too, day two. 

You'd need full eradication entire virus Denmark. impossible point.

They killed minks long time ago, obviously. point look forward unless think need send military streets know going stop strain? mean naturally die summer? literally went summer infections went like crazy... HURRRRRRAH YALLER GIRLS

DOODLE LET GOOOOO ü§¢ shit never going away... ship sailed  Lol joking?  yank, respect hell speed action guys acting. Housewife drama. give fuck follow something love every mink country, new ones introduced Corona. several years farms turned something else may end banned many try restart it.

Over next days 40% worlds amount mink farms fur die, ending miserable existence. far know, clear yet. Theoretically ok. live virus main wrapper, chimp virus designed replicate humans. know immunocompromised part trial yet though might enough data say sure. Every 10 seconds past 24 hours someone died covid! 

8,574 dying means 30,000+ people probably affected death. Maybe wife husband, parents, children, siblings etc. Ans let's forget nurses doctors. Europe island, can't ban travels countries. depend heavily (import/export) large number people cross borders daily / weekly jobs.

Dane, think likely scenario. already assemblies limited 10 people public, mandatory masks, loooooong list measures. Taking extra step prevent spread new strain feel much different current condition. Worst case scenario strain spreads quick enough vaccines don‚Äôt work well wait months another vaccine produced new strain. least that‚Äôs I‚Äôm thinking reading Denmark‚Äôs issue least we‚Äôre locked down. Danes smart enough let people travel. damn, COVID-21 scariest acronym imagine. Coming new iPhone Christmas Ah, yes. You, side media, major corporations, radical ideologies like Islam backing them. one that's brainwashed. fact election close tells us that, least, close 50% us still take coronavirus seriously.
 
So expect large minority (or even majority) Thanksgivings go usual. Needless say, that's BAD. there's going Christmas, happen one month later: fallout Thanksgiving starts really get rolling.

Those 400,000 deaths predicted February everyone mocking? Looks probable. 

(Even there's vaccine approved early December, rollout slow, plus get it, there's time delay efficacy taking shot. nearly enough us would protected time Christmas.) Fuck that. Put fly list good. Faa ban ass. know, given discrepancy voted person voted via mail, could shift electoral outcomes next election? probably have! ban antibody testing works 8 weeks post virus. agree more. Hope goes without saying, need transport mink anywhere else world study... virus jumped species, demonstrated polyvalence, may jump more.

The virus reproduces, mutates gets chances useful mutations. lot humans, lot getting infected, giving lot chances.

Something may rare give millions chances happen, eventually does.

That‚Äôs important contain virus, many didn‚Äôt still don‚Äôt understand that. Well, bit concerning Minkvirus otterhand... Trump voter. think never admit makes liable. Knowing thing circulating winter warning anyone. hoping would ‚Äúgo away‚Äù. d614g mutation spread across world February, roughly 9 months date. longer dominant strain Europe though. oh see, that's unfortunate. We're second wave (aka Season 2) right now, would Season ***3*** coming real soon. got refund though based article. Thank support. want poor driver support? 
Here, meet Windows XP.... 64 bit edition. best explanation they‚Äôre thinking anyone else except themselves. But, yes, agree, extremely clear rest us! Wait, people still use Mink? thought stopped using whole thing 90s! sheriffs it‚Äôs huge county. They‚Äôve shutdown places it‚Äôs going possible enforce anything Im trying argue troll you, Im enjoying discussion understand framework debating from. It‚Äôs ‚Äúgovernment household‚Äù framework needs balance budget; balancing funding revenues taxes. understand saying government funds, eventually needs paid back cannot print money forever.

But printing money forever really Im advocating either. Perhaps Im poor job explaining think you‚Äôre missing point. paying back debt balancing budget unnecessary given US sovereign currency issuer currency user. fact, even eliminating deficit bad consequences. 

For example, Clinton years, government achieved unprecedented surplus negative consequences private sector surpluses government deficits private sector surpluses inverse relationship. Why? government balancing budget actually negative impacts economy. [This chart illustrates 

If government creates money first framework, pay debt would [eliminate entire money 

This Im saying real concern impact make inflation real resources. government deficit actually good thing consequences economy hugely positive. Genetics 100% factor needs studied risk individuals identified. explanation one family catch many die become seriously ill another gets everyone asymptomatic mildly ill best. Nope thats says.

It says lockdowns moves problem forward time. Something learning true autumn.

It says nothing Stockholm gaining herd immunity.

Again. actually read article? want read Danish, title says ‚Äùsl√•s ihjel"". means beaten death. Yesss Denmark please take us fuck rates varied widely farm, depending ages animals, Dr. Taylor said. infections killing 40% breeding flocks, yet death rates remain low younger minks, said. Joe. Joe... uh... F√ºrfahrmere.

He's immigrant, good heart. American envious country follows science. (Still sad mink humanity.) resist like Americans do. vaccine stops original variants, mink variant may become dominant. Great. breed millions animals cram together tiny spaces satisfy demand ugly coats ugly freaking false eyelashes greedy, ugly humans buy. Humans need stop factory farming practices already. one needs fur coats meat dairy go back raised like past, smaller-scale local farm operations. 

I‚Äôm vegetarian I‚Äôm willing pay higher price local dairy eggs means reversing climate change reducing amount viral outbreaks happen factory farming practices every year, happening decades even Covid.

One day soon, whether like not, we‚Äôre going start treating meat dairy like luxury items. fast food burgers. It‚Äôs worth planet freaking uninhabitable. insightful commentary quality input, congratulations mysterious upper respiratory infection last year. one knew threw whatever it. Hellish week. talk without coughing constantly breath. believe I've already. whole damn thing already wake-up call.

We another virus, say next like 20-30% fatality infectious.

This come animal like mink bet.

Like, clear doomsday scenario really major stretch imagination anymore. 

It addressed now. Like holy fuck, lock 1/3 humanity ought able eliminate shit. Inhumane farming conditions domesticating wild animals mass perversion. gets feed feed could possibly done? labs chuck samples one week. could test individuals? one thing could aren‚Äôt testing waste water samples everywhere mass T-cell testing. would answer question aren‚Äôt that. Why?  Money. answer usually money. whole thing sick. this? Humans cruel. Embrace Zoom hell kids! Yes. nutshell: ""Lockdowns useless since virus spreads fast uncontrollably population. also way, almost herd immunity Stockholm.""

These assumptions based influenza. epidemiologists Finland said things beginning admitted mistake. spread controlled since spreads via clusters superspreading (even without police patrolling streets; lockdowns hard) herd immunity threshold likely much higher 35% one influenza. I'm still looking Hansen Mansem Don‚Äôt fuck cats Exactly especially given know contagious is. Nebulized albuterol treatments standard care past winter flu patients got banned March due COVID guess what? non-stop aerosolized spread everywhere. BiPAP. I‚Äôm convinced huge contributing factor high death rate way treated beginning. early intubations death sentence patients. thing need anything nebulized albuterol put Bipap non-invasive way help someone breath. stopped March are. Absolutely, hope beginning end fur farming least! good wake call animal farming conditions general.  Oh goddammit...""Denmarkvirus"" really roll tongue. Apparently issue summer coats still, winter coats can't harvest fur leaving virus fester mutate months also option. 2 major metro areas? one 9.5 million people 700,000 (East side st. louis)? Correct. seems new strain virus, afaik 12 people already infected. (Not sure though). No, I‚Äôve said elsewhere, hope animals dying step toward ending farms.

After looking today situation mink farming pretty appalling. said humans lack b12 end like me. lacks malabsorption.

I take proton-pump inhibitor, well informed medical realities B12 seem think result. entire reason I'm willing stand watch make claims objectively untrue it. 

For example, entire reason tablets work [gastric intrinsic defective. That's true overwhelming majority people, stop trying pass though dishonest ""Why would subject everyone suffering getting b12 shot every weeks"" bullshit. choose veganism vegetarianism that's fine. humans absolutely cannot live completely without meat.


I read exactly said, fact remains claim demonstrably wrong. read. Alive healthy two different things mate. absolutely cannot live completely without meat.

Again, read wrote fine. still literally told consultant nutritionist.

I highly doubt nutritionist told humans cannot live completely without meat, wont dismiss possible. all, anyone call nutritionist without sort training, education, professional license. dietitians actual degree certification professional Vegans also like lot times.

And they, unlike you, take simple B12 supplement actually absorb normal efficiency. *You* can't, *you're* representative overwhelmingly vast majority humans, stop pretending otherwise.

Little random, but, likely admitted patients (of covid) put IV-nourishment. ppl panic even though know nothing abt it‚Äôs spreading capabilities I'm vegetarian think gassing minks sounds better snapping necks (which typical way killing rodents, minks size of) punching holes heads. mutated mean sense? Like it‚Äôs mutated infect minks like new evolution virus?  lot famers assume never recover Wild minks still exist fine. 

Minks born bred captivity, living lives tiny cages killed skinned small fraction lifespan, suffer.

Minks never born existence don‚Äôt suffer.

Why *better* creature exist tortured suffer entire life? That‚Äôs existence.  Jesus decided today would mink day thread? Name checks I‚Äôm done answering questions. You‚Äôre meaningless.

Interesting. mom who's doctor mentioned anything past dexamethasone remdesivir, though I'm medical professional asked.

I'm thinking aspirin would good preventative measure. anyone's reading this, donating blood good way thin blood too. donate every months since I'm O- think good way prevent clots.

Funny mention supplements, I'm actually taking daily basis regardless. jury spoken killing done today? weeks? please already closed borders? Murica.. rather vote dead guy died virus party rolls caves refuses fight, opposition may try fight deadly virus.

Despite early day (21:00 GMT), Worldometer's reported COVID-19 death toll already exceeds peak recorded April 17th. Total deaths likely significantly higher time Worldometer rolls counters day. 

Note sources death counts day sources may report different data (and Worldometers typically rated ""less reliable"" - favoring speed data accuracy). still milestone, although cases risen new highs, deaths lagged April peak testing limited less serious cases missed. Regardless exact specifics, entering new stage pandemic - worse experienced Spring. Aliens? That's bet 2021. Imagine coming right away telling world threat humanity instead lying months trying cover severe is. I‚Äôm disrespectful. stand opinion didn‚Äôt die. 

If hospital overstretched, I‚Äôm sure are, doesn‚Äôt mean one culpable. school situation?

... spend lot time YouTube. mutation exactly? see google economic impact stuff effect stupid irresponsible, it‚Äôs like deliberately want destroy hospital workers. Good Fuck Denmark particular. Largest mink fur producer world mean died 1.	‚Å†Yes, see people says Sweden good, good, bad spring *all time.*
Other that, literally *every* comment pointing Sweden's many failures, otherwise puts Sweden bad light, gets mass downvoted reported big group Swedish campaigners here.
2.	‚Å†About per capita. ridiculous thinking chances Sweden handle better US. look Sweden's neighboring countries see hard Sweden failed. plenty counties gotten virus control infections low. testing lot works well. aren‚Äôt really trying control virus agree. would want let go? vegan! both. Positive Sweden threads right wing nutjobs going 'see herd immunity works everyone go back work fuck masks' posts 'see herd immunity die die die haha right' Ok, 2nd lockdown 4 weeks. 4 weeks pass go back square one. 3 months lockdown previously didn‚Äôt save nation. surprised 4 weeks lockdown extended. lock people up, get angry depressed start rebel cause trouble end. heart truly goes affected Covid. must better solution. Corona like: new year new me!  go profile, win admit losing. Wut? Definitely case France, Germany, Italy, ... started too... Sure do, sounds little childish me. Mook mean issues? seem recall several illnesses came animals. Source this? misfortune seeing mink die farm. One many reasons vegan.

We cruel brutal species, personally believe everything going us reaping sow. realy, everytime farm gets infected gas minks. 
What weird understood many minks farms get infected, saw first farm infection gov made sure farms good covid rules. 

For time gov thinking farmers infecting animals compensation money get farm gets killed (because stop 2024 anyway less money)

But investigation showed happening many different mink farms (64) got covid, idea. know doesn‚Äôt work like fucking funny would ( fucked nihilistic sort way) made virus airborne via smoke carried mile. unnecessary is, legal. seems less legal many animals point killing 17 million (from different article today Denmark) trying keep alive much hassle. Danish government sort economic assistance plan help farmers weather loss? really, states like NY California still partial lockdowns. Russia 100% open. Lmao end day got life together dude calling weak see fit ironic thing vegetarian. Depends Election. strict paper. reality almost controls, are, fines (I've seen couple controls, never fine, even once). Also problem law, many restrictions get quickly dropped turn unconstitutional. curfew going dropped too, already lawsuit. Nothing control people act like Covid never happened explains infection rate climbing fast. imagine virus hopping pigeon. little shitter transmit animals people may come contact with... Sure I'll bet. much? We'll get 3rd party hold cash make sure someone doesnt go missing. disappeared? Ah shit, go again. Reassuring thread here: not, knew read chart also hundreds thousands dead show it. argument changing lockdown = worse economic outcomes mass death = good actually listening medical advice?

So better listening medical advice economy, that? D-O-N-E fucked! flatmates thousands others congregating Central London tonight even terror threats coronavirus.

Also cold. poor minks we're let's also abolish coronaviruses. I'm tired fucking things. Jesus fucking Christ, Plague Inc. Nostradamian shit moment what? fucking disgusting they're farming first place. stuff I've seen pig farming Denmark disgusting too. Idiots. Schools back week week mid-term break. zombievirus starts every movie ever.

Attack Danish Zombieminks personally think clear whole US. view, better comparison would like Virginia 10K cases, Virginia similar population Switzerland. say like Florida 20-25K cases. cookies vegan! Really terrible see. kinds cases invoked fear early on, people simply collapsing public, likely clotting-related issues. young lady dorm room probably collapsed similar fashion, except one help her. tragic.  even related sarscov2 unrelated coronavirus won't, find hard believe would implement anything strict enough prevent find even harder believe one would break ever come with.   It‚Äôs opinion. Go look numbers flu deaths state.  comparison valid confirmed counts both. going use surveillance data flu, can‚Äôt make comparison covid don‚Äôt data. Sorry, facts. don‚Äôt believe that, science denier. even check COVID mutations among mink human workers? Need info. minks get Covid? people keep mink pets. visited mink farm once. quick fierce. agree effort slaughter minks delay spread, two bad assumptions made here...

1. strain present minks humans specific area

2. eradicated minks contained humans.

Both probably true. Jesus fucking christ cross, means vaccines answer even herd immunity answer. Holy shit. Lol @ ur comments like general I'm pretty bad day today given election rising infection rates. Plus job put vacation blackout November Christmas subtly written note going home see families Thanksgiving. know bothers much. one hand makes total sense other, perfectly okay expose bearly enough money get by? sick work okay safe seeing friends family selfish. Ugh. even going holidays want expose family.

I guess vacation blackout bothers most. going take Friday recharge. personally planning seeing family really need nice long weekend recharge.

It seems wrong employer mandate personal life bearly adhere corona precautions office. really want get tracking effective tax rates risk adjusting low probability catastrophic events? get fun talking point US's lowest income individuals get Medicaid essentially free provides comparable coverage comparable protections private systems remainder, statistically, unlikely impacted catastrophic health event. I'm sure much UK pride, really get excited, country big powderkeg US. Rest big factor immunity healing. Avoid anything stressful, best can. Good luck üçÄ Danish response politicians overruled scientists.

they overruled importance closing borders. area politicians went scientists? SARS came civets. Meanwhile, China ADE? Covid-20 follow logic... country Minsk small country? I'm scared maintenance updates cancelled.  Yes, 5-6 times testing Sweden. Sure. That's good. Look US response. admit catastrophe. half country think way little.

But dissidence allowed one party Sweden. think negative test 8 months ER tells us much anything. Enjoy dealing Covid then. Reddit incredibly US-centric. US even started review process.

The UK saying good go definitely huge news, real record breaking heavily upvoted thread always ""FDA approved &lt;insert vaccine emergency use"" Ohhh okay, makes sense. Thanks reply :) Women labor nothing common things mentioned. I'm not. keep crashing itself. No, Batman far gnarly paraphilias average furry. HA! laughed running Covid-Linux, well I'm immune, yall screwed! also recommend go protest BLM earlier year? 6475 sooooo many deaths.

Canada population Poland 10,000 deaths nobody freaking out.

It looks like Poland experiencing first wave. hasnt one yet. think overestimate value testing. clear correlation countries test lot good results have.

A test also snapshot things looking given time. disease like Covid-19 around hundreds days current state value useful. smaller number tests tell trend precision much less cost.

The tests also still accurate comes false negatives. general one trust positive tests. Oh.. see. Thank light up. need detail, divide 4 benghazis! Scary live here. level trust Covid management outside hospitals practically eroded. don‚Äôt see everyone wearing masks public transport shops crowds people outside restaurants eat promotions wearing masks. used live Hong Kong SARS outbreak back then, masks new using sanitizer whole city came together complied, even private businesses building owners/managers disinfecting everything regularly even escalator handle belts train seats lift buttons covered long plastic film changed regularly. Almost buildings visited lift lobbies would sanitisers lift buttons people use. stayed SARS days enhanced Covid-19. 
I don‚Äôt see here. community confused divided unfortunately. Hahaaaa I'm near exit 10 495 Ok keep eye news. contagious good idea. want ADE this, even less deadly first infection. Many places done poor job well. reason sweden attracted attention right wing anti lockdown people promoting sort ideal. proven myth think people move on. Actually, minks lives agroindustrials farms harvest fur. Okay detected it, means circulating quite time. probably European countries, spread further. people vaccinated, form virus spread freely thereby continuing pandemic. 

It going quite time strike balance virus. vaccines rolled in, vaccine-evading mutants arise drive pandemic. Probably going take 10-15 years back normal, meantime Covid couple times. live Mexico sister (30F) got sick around January. thought influenza, cough lasted entire month, (20F) got sick bit fever it. Could covid? live Mexico City btw. that's also difference Swedish Danish response, Swedish response better worse directly decided scientists politicans, Danish response politicians overruled scientists. Turkey reporting asymptomatic cases get Russia coming from. Really bad means overall hospitals overwhelmed people dying causes medical treatment available (equipment personnel) focus. focus containing spread among humans, understand reasons mutations, find reservoirs potential.

I'm worried they'll fail, already smells like incompetence. let's wait press conference. 2nd wave wild. know part reason seeing record numbers testing, still. Chilling see. Let‚Äôs hope die perhaps?  Might silly question, anyways:

If one probably exposed COVID-19, staying room infectious person, measures taken mitigate effects possible infection? 

After couple weeks fo WFH, went back office Monday. work room another person, desks 6-7 feet apart. Monday, everything fine. Yesterday, started coughing, directly me, kinda direction... asked he's okay, symptoms like loss smell, etc... He's like 'oh, I'm fine, little cold, nothing worry about'. Well suuure..... room 5-6 hours day.

This morning come in, says fever get tested. 

So guy remember getting fever 4+ years I've working him, I'm quite positive COVID-19 now. 

I already came back home, self-isolate gets test results back, he's positive, I'll stay home next 2 weeks least. 

I'm fine now, measures taken help immune system fight back possible infection? mean stuff like getting lot rest, taking vit. C, zinc? there's really nothing help body stage already system, hope best? I'm scared Covid-ME Meat saves lives; let‚Äôs make free everyone. Highest since April bit misleading since it‚Äôs much higher April, yeah? Foque  beyond premature Lactobacillus also relatively inexpensive produce amenable genetic modification, meaning Xiang genetically engineer bacteria produce SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

So plan is, (a) figure modify Lactobacillus produce Covid. proteins surface; (b) demonstrate modified germ produces immune response; (c) find doesn't, repeat (a); finally enter phase 1, phase 2, phase 3... first step alone could multi-year (certainly multi-month) research project. Check back guy 2022. Sweden proven history very, bad handling pandemic though, they're entering second wave now, think Swedish situation continued discussed. KNOWS? Although funny many things crazy conspiracy loonies talked actually coming true.

From eternal lockdowns, quarantine centers, digital currency, travel passes, (almost) mandatory vaccines (now nanoparticles!) .. stuff conspiracy folks yelling about.

I mean I'm sure coincidental, still funny.  SARS (2002) came thing. Maybe time stop havin ferrets pets. Ask asymptomatic person cough. apparently needs. live Arizona I'm almost positive Dec 30th. haven‚Äôt even really deal coronavirus real flu season. got tail end NYC still ripped 20% population overwhelmed hospitals.

Learning history, math, biology art teach empathy. Working alongside people hearing lives struggles better way learn empathy. 

Much written link self esteem empathy. child difficulty learning math get enough eat, people difficulty learning empathy (or feel are) judged, attacked belittled. 

The derogatory term ""Social Justice Warrior"" describes emotionally hostile person erodes people's ability feel empathy. attack effective last decade. Yeah think problem right nobody knows anyone sick, people *do* know got Covid (friends, celebrities, athletes) fine it. ""No big deal people conditions like diabetes need worry""

*cracks open tenth mountain dew* Good parents. Lucky kids. God bless It‚Äôs updated Covid-XP Covid-Vista now. person, smart enough understand people spent lifetime working understanding exact scenario, MIGHT worth listening to...

Yup, make much fuss lose job. Already threatened. Fuck. people trying shift blame extreme effects covid china asinine, xenophobic, irresponsible.

At point, frankly, china looks among handful qualified nations lead responses pandemics.

This region heavily locked prevent spread new coronavirus. beautiful actually. love fur. Also found traces virus foots seagulls... retired paramedic. came retirement give Cleveland EMS hand several months ago. 28yo man die covid days ago. ain't game. Ask people see first hand! real guys!

So becomes like HIV body can't kill? record clear, covid spreading uncontrolled rest world, *would* contained china, actually taking stringent enough measures eliminate cases there.

Only handful countries taken measures serious china, maybe nobody else degree. Yeah green one! Oh ffs even mean? agree well said. Even said CCP absolutely amazing job corona virus.

i know shitty situation covid vista would fearsome... people literarily crashing getting incredible slow loosing abilities left right randomly :/ Thanks. wonder tests work. Like antibodies testing. idea talking about. like it. hope covid-20 (barf) similar enough mutation affect anything. Human Seagull Mink Human unfortunately enough journey change covid-19 significantly. *hamberders

FTFY ;-) exactly date change. Keep seeing everywhere. wll continue like 2021 Lol nobody‚Äôs ignoring it‚Äôs fear mongering worry vaccine effectiveness you‚Äôre implying it‚Äôs going go infection spree covid has. Don‚Äôt tell either little bro also incredibly effective spreading humans, pressure hurt less. Definitely, fucking sucks: actually know massive mink farms Jutland hearing couple months ago relation COVID, felt ashamed country something like Already spreading though isn‚Äôt it? it‚Äôs humans weeks it‚Äôs late. mean, fact I'm really concerned instance whether covid control china not.

We *know* control USA, states, including mine, essentially *nothing* slow spread it.

I'm concerned health health friends family.

I'd happily endorse stringent lockdowns cities US stop covid. No. Either minks must die new virus roll humanity slowly. live humanity gets utterly creampied new virus like is. :)  Yes Antibody-dependent enhancement. happens insufficient/non-neutralizing antibodies produced previous infection bind virus, better facilitating entry cells. works antibodies typically bind pathogens make easier immune cells engulf destroy them. non-neutralizing antibodies weakly bind/interact virus, resulting immune cells taking virus, destroying them. Studies shows minks infected easily cats dogs - told Danish press breafing. also important note, virus probably able mutate mink due many kept farm - we're speaking tousands farm. Way hosts spread cats dogs anywhere. Stop ignoring possible issue regarding effectiveness vaccine. COVID-19, mutated slightly way make vaccine less effective. Pay attention 100,000= 1,00,000 = 1 lakh
1 million = 10 lakh
10 million = 1 crore headline like something movie, even good one. sky rats doom us No. Can‚Äôt wait 2020 season finale. Wild. Technically yes. Someone rarest chances version coronavirus that‚Äôs compatible minks coincidentally happened near mink got it, mink went near minks spread there. 

The mutation happen animal technically speaking, however it‚Äôs much likely jump mammal mammal. nightmare scenario mammals could get infected, enough mutations single vaccine could never found humanity, would effectively kill meat industry would explain since spring asthma going away... mild symptoms France enough test tested... timing tell got COVID back then... doctor still think allergy, wih could made go scan lungs sure COVID damage... SARS-Cov2 mutation, different coronavirus? Nope. Danish politicians currently talking people adhering recommendations. contain it. Thank bud can‚Äôt believe people trying deny China‚Äôs role whole ordeal. It‚Äôs almost like one heard Butterfly Effect. SEASON 2 CONFIRMED BABY! Yo it‚Äôs beyond hasty say mink virus going invalidate vaccines like people actually think virus somehow infect near 1 billion people like covid fear mongering Okay calm now. one said deadly, even certain react well vaccine, even certain particular strain mutated enough meaningful herm regular strain do. You‚Äôre also idiot. experience Dane Brussels Flemish newspapers there. Spot on. hoped interaction would strong enough, time. look like it.
Perhaps, raised awareness help.

Cook message simpleton shove brain everyone.

This virus jumps species easily.
Therefore, evolve differently time, making lethal disease likely. (That's idiots try mind gymnastics.)  Yeah, ultimately pandemics come animal industry, whether that‚Äôs cows measles, apes HIV, minks covid-19+(?). need rethink relationship animals way substantially reduces ability viruses spread us species. Yes, think eventually end vaccine. don‚Äôt think ever rid world covid19, natural infection vaccination get level immunity decrease outbreaks. won‚Äôt instantaneous soon find vaccine works, yes, believe get there. Spanish flu burned population still descendant strains around today vaccination handle those. covid completely novel humans, we‚Äôre easily infected now. people gain immunity, even it‚Äôs partial, thought covid19 severe may become like seasonal cold years come.

I'm sorry think messed sentence there, understand final clause.

I think china's handling virus related willingness government enforce strict lockdowns, though they're government try similar measures (and record, quite large degree, support measures) Fucking m√•ge f√∏dder love wearing leather made people like you, doesnt mean Ill it. /s time come. cheap soon though. soup us! foreign ecosystem scandinavia escaped mink significant problem wildlife birds. getting rid wonderful number reasons.

well maybe eating mink soup mass culled entirety region. that's mutated see less effects antibodies.
They can't conclude less deadly minks factory farmed fur. probably kept close quarters constantly around people. HI- hope continue feel ok (your family too). opinion would get tested positive- staying home- sorry. negative, think probably safe play- (and feeling) need let others playing know- know virus, sick, was, better, tested negative (insert date).

Good luck it- hope play team wins match ;) quote make particular development news. Predictable sure, still news. experience sub Sweden threads dominated left wing nutjobs actively want death destruction say ""I told so""  Military police come every single farm suppose. Exactly. Burying heads sand help matters. know they're going destroy mink farms, long mutation likely already spread caught isolated immediately. definitely downvote comment it‚Äôs hasty declare

He‚Äôs assuming vaccine effectiveness fucked implies infect near 1 billion people like covid No, contained. Within china? yes.

By time c19 spreading widely US, Europe, elsewhere, already information know infectious, deadly disease, yet US government, along many governments, little contain &amp; track virus. Apart asking praise, Taiwan offers absolutely specific useful advice policy blueprint country.

In comparison, South Korea's expodited testing implementation good policy country learn. controlling Church's outbreak purely contact tracing quite impressive, use drive testing learned many countries.

In another comparison, China's general lockdown measures, used throughout Chinese history, finally learned West. used correctly, allows country want gamble human life eliminate respiratory disease. Reuters reported too: separate, different coronavirus found mink may jump humans?

Lol, you‚Äôre moron troll. poor animals Still vegan saw? need Jesus Shut admit like staying indoors mink farmer friends (not counting mink farmer acquaintances mink farmer enemies) ready willing *thank much*. Well least happens country who's denial covid. Imagine Brazil. be. Animals have, far know, capacity emotion humans. lack empathy toward compared capacity empathy humans. 

The systematic slaughtering animals also normalized since eat certain animals survive. numb atrocity we're committing since default state nature cruel. 

Nature actually extremely fucked up. premise living entities capacity emotion brutally kill entities survive cruel.

I already broke pretty elementary level I‚Äôll try again. 

Yes; news currently nothing vaccine efforts now. dominant strain Covid remains original code mutation found Europe. 

Human human transmission found. Anything everything regarding new mutation peer reviewed. It‚Äôs even discussion. It‚Äôs irrelevant. 

It sucks, sure. it‚Äôs chat current vaccine efforts. Pointless comment. worry US mink farmers might willing

Mink lives matter. That‚Äôs quite different saying they‚Äôre affected it. true!!! write true. Trust idea go UFO rabbit hole. right good time actual government backing UAPs real, unclassified report comes Jan feb next year...hopefully. like covid special. 

""somehow virus got *inside* ~~pangolin~~ mink"" God, hope use nitrogen something instead CO2.

CO2 probably one painful deaths could imagine often used gassing animals.

That feeling hold breath long, called air hunger, caused lack oxygen, CO2. Imagine feeling panic x10. Even worse top that, know burp something carbonated, comes nose burns? Imagine feeling x100 whole respiratory system.

All need kill animals displace oxygen, done number mostly inert gasses. way get drowsy, faint die pain suffering. 

From know carbon monoxide, might even work, need displace much oxygen CO blocks absorption oxygen left anyway. That‚Äôs basically every animal, even domesticated ones. ethical? Never heard Fink Marmer? dad used tell stories time. scariest thing fact happen(s/ed) America, would hushed much possible there'd mink deaths... name capitalism! exact reason go ""herd immunity"".

There reason cure common cold. viruses cause avoided lockdowns, free mutate among human carriers hundreds years, variety grows large. Eventually cold virus many variants science cannot pinpoint antibody vaccine.

Having said that, shocking coronavirus mutated fast. even year yet.  asking different question. term ""humanely"" used context means minimize pain, yes, kill animals way involves zero pain, thus humane. asking moral question concerning animal rights agree slaughtering animals cruel, that's incompatible separate question slaughtering, done, done humanely. Someone turned one gull virus RNA it. ever investigated active virus inactive virus?

Another theory humans carried virus mink farms. point girl dying alone dorm room could avoided.

That match No, patients given blood thinners aspirin reduce risk. 

Reduced risk =/= guaranteed cure.

But talk like doctor's nothing reduce risk went pointing fingers saying negligence, disrespectful general.

This actually big deal needs contained. Give permalinks. released August. November now, get pedantic like.

The point vaccine use, need stop downplaying use unless actually information. I'm interested probablies.


The vaccine use least couple months Russia seeing time highs. 

The questions important are

Is likely path US flow?
Is Russian vaccine defective?

Wasn't really looking pedantry pretend expertise Russian government distributing vaccinations. R value calculated? require contract tracing done calculate it?

Moving species species

Quite zoonotic know countries, Denmark already verge shutting this. basically eradicate mink farms (and compensate farmers), real purpose reason continue it. basically final nail coffin. 
 
Although think Denmark least worries comes this. Plenty much bigger (and underdeveloped) countries still this, likely also way less restrictions, I'm afraid really change anything. 
 
EDIT: actually see misread first post, thought meant Denmark specifically world ban. bad. Oh man going cut margins.... One of, earliest memory pile burning cows foot mouth outbreak. Maybe similar mink piles. gone away, stabilized. ""it affect young people"" informed certain orange someone...  mean US mink deaths caused new strain. Minks susceptible Covid 19 well. Irrelevant unnecessary information fear mongering. Worst case scenario possibilities talked serious regard news vaccination. Unless one tells you, going immanent problem, comments like irresponsible. board already filled mentally ill people~ ur prime case point luv Ugh, believe it? Going hospital pay insurmountable debt rest life?

Suspected spread seagulls; minks (15+ million) Denmark gassed. little late. predicted case economic pressure make wrong call longer goes on, things change learn it, less likely seems ever I'll leave house grocery pickup. way scared? said people stop downvoting factual information they‚Äôre scared lol. don‚Äôt ability comprehend read apparently. genuinely feel bad you. hope get help need high school special Ed classes talking eradicating COVID 19, I'm talking stopping specific mutation currently found one small area one small country. Wasn‚Äôt also mutation Vietnam seemed worry people months ago? responding well antibodies? exactly mean? I'm going waste time looking articles subject. even know look, frank. However study discusses international media covered Sweden says it‚Äôs winding down? No, idiotic Danish government let rot piles outside incompetent are. Probably busy social distancing wearing masks infecting other. Morons. Maybe, maybe not. one knows yet. lose hope. Lungs also regenerate, albeit slowly. take time heal, impossible. isolating virus denmark nearly impossible. take 1 person cross border Sweden example strain become pandemic. delete repost? Sorry. Honestly. care say. parenting much working. one teaching two year old values. full day daycare 5 lot. even understand people think working better use time. Working necessity different working choice. Women's movements destroyed family unity. kids want home two hours morning like maybe 4 awake hours night. Ah, corona virus plandemic hoax endgame, put stop mink farming business!  issue need get 1000-1300C. kinda temperature requires insulation. 

As ashes, may want keep them, may want capture testing. allow 17 million minks worth smoke pollute everything; ensure safe, mix fertiliser something.

EDIT: Apparently open fires get hot, they're pretty fuckin' big. want poor danish sod who's putting infected rat carcasses centre fire that's bigger am, hazmat suit. minks 

Cant mean Minks surely? mean need breeding stock recover? Propably farms get tested isolated find 100% clean ones spare them. import minks. doctor, FIL it, prescribed blood thinner steroid don‚Äôt think prescribed unless sicker/hospitalized. would definitely report shortness breath doctor immediately happens. Also probably good idea get pulse oximeter possible. ""Fixed stability issues jumping humans animals back."" issue lockdowns work humans. one locking mother nature animal populations (wild domesticated) spreading disease.

Now multiple animal reservoirs documented, ZERO chance we'll eradicate disease, 100% chance we'll see new strains. Lol stop saying fear started scared one anyways yeah I‚Äôm right here

And I‚Äôm inviting make laugh Looks like Alien Invasion pushed December then, November Mink Covid! Seriously tho, could come horrible time. Keep safe there! record trying make argument flu covid-19 same, want say get long term effects flu well usually get ignored. personally vaccinate flu every year even though I'm strictly risk. Ah, blaming country told November 2019 country successfully contained country world. pathetic be.  speaks mental capacity sure. STOP EATING WEIRD ANIMALS  
FUCK one hand Denmark Mink Plague vaccines fucked life world doomed lung tissue scarred everyone long hauler fucked life, 5 seconds later, gotta vaccine we're going back normal everyone, nothing see here.  


I really exhausted back forth agenda everything.  


I remember articles april / may group developed something breathe prevented getting infected even heard since. Something inhibiting viral replication something. know.  


In end, something applicable life, aware real threat exists could kill people love. want ignore go get cheeseburger not. Pronounced ""Dan-ish"" 90% sea salt tested across main brands US contained tiny plastic pieces.

Many types tooth paste contain tiny plastic (cleaning crystals ad speak).

If think plastic contamination limited food chain overlooking direct ways consume plastic. COVID-20. goes year afaik. Again, you‚Äôre projecting fear onto facts. one stressing it. article says something need watch for. Burying head sand like ostrich something scares isn‚Äôt best way prepared future. spreading, spread, they‚Äôre trying stop gets worse, hopefully we‚Äôll never know spreads like not. that‚Äôs point. 

Also, quit calling friend backup can‚Äôt fight battles lol. know right? Children lol. flu kills 15k-60k americans per year saying expect 300k-2400k deaths covid. 10x deaths would 150k-600k deaths. 10x seems lot likely.

But actually less covid spreads much faster flu. people getting covid. actually 10x deadly spreads faster 10x people would dying.  Jesus fuckin christ  fr tho, winter last couple years 10 degrees celsius. Long winter probable. (imo. say cause GOT reference sounds cool) 1. No. That's US works anymore
2. Please edit titles. tomorrow? fuck close everything right second, thats would is, all, different strain general type virus causes common cold.

My biggest fear Covid mutates three four active strains require separate vaccine developed kill first (or, perhaps, second) strain.

The independent strains active, chances mutate, chances new strains crop up

We may find situation many strains cropping fast dealt all. Kind like common cold!

The good news new strain first step direction, unclear step actually full taken. shall see cannot contained. Covid-19 found multiple animal groups. way eradicate it. happens kill eat seabird? eat soul? soul become poop? need funeral poop? gas them, think they're going try sell merch? Black Market? Ship China? Why'd wait 4 months found corona spreading among minks? wouldnt necessarily need crematorium dont need keep ashes anything, options burn them. thinking realized they‚Äôre probably killed fur idk would make difference saying new infections since May 25th? Right, animal infection detected. others. 

Covid-19 cannot eradicated, return yearly. google ;) real. exactly know look like. world needs hard look itself. Supplying mink fur rich wanting pose fur coats fucked man. Like, proper fucked up. mad need 10s millions minks keep demand. Wow fact mink farms still exist fucking insane casually people talk ""gassing 2 million them"" kinda horrific. still mink farms first place? ever went ""I can't keep warm, NEED coat made 10239 minks I'll die!"". purely sadistic monetary thing. Really hope least puts stop it. I‚Äôm getting whiplash point you‚Äôre trying make lol. Thankfully Biden declared winner bit ago. Heh friend living NYC went NOLA everything shut March too, party person likes travelling, food seeing local events. Everything seemed pretty party central still Instagram stories. 

Can't really fault people enough widespread, consistent information situation kind unprecedented recent times. Alas, poor Yorrick. Aside negative response antibodies information this? deadly, contagious etc. picture give confidence believe response. Sweden see dramatic increase flying minks covid19 variants might become endemic.

That's basically guaranteed point. multiple confirmed animal reservoirs, way eradicate it. mean sealandgulls? also gas bury them. country 10 times population course

4 million cows would barely different normal day Brazil, mean large procedure country like UK Seagul put too. Specificity % = (# true negatives)/(# true negatives + # false positives) x 100%

These excellent numbers btw. AUC 0.97 amazing - max could 1; lower end, 0.5 would mean better random chance.

And especially asymptomatics, want high sensitivity possible individual quarantined; lower specificity mean people disease get quarantined that's FAR smaller price pay actually infected undiagnosed individual roaming freely transmitting disease. look back 2020 best year decade. Well walking outside usually putting mask know likelihood coming close people. Still show good anything else, ten sec interaction passing sidewalk already low risk. mink virus Netherlands Denmark came seagulls? one came first jump one country other? Don‚Äôt forget ‚ÄúOld people power stop fuck all! young people suffer it!‚Äù

And considering vast majority states ravaged still overwhelmingly voted Trump, I‚Äôd say earned herd immunity. It‚Äôs voted for! news isn‚Äôt spread minks, mutated result easy though pictures disgusting. News sites like BBC would helicopter fly farm there's thousand cows laying top eachother burning. I'm vegan vegetarian gassing minks thing deeply destressing me. resistance existing anti-bodies

Yeah that's great all, virus resistant existing anti-bodies forever. We've always known likely scenario COVID need vaccine every year considering rapid mutation, like flu. show statistics children dying infection 3rd 1st world countries. Real test Europe NA winter, flu jumps ring. actually slotted phased 2024, looks like it‚Äôll happen faster now. didn‚Äôt want yank hurt lot people financially, suddenly. Kind like fracking US. Phase halting abruptly financially ruin people. Nah Denmark we‚Äôve known possible mutations weeks, it‚Äôs (killing minks) political topic weeks aswell. It‚Äôs first it‚Äôs spread back humans. yeah we‚Äôve known. first minks got corona quickly put down. started spreading rapidly amongst minks, goverment didn‚Äôt act time. it‚Äôs probably late hope so. show evidence doctors? show long-term effects common significant help tremendously lockdown morale. Better getting cut fur.  covid-20 mean, really agree disagree scenario say working parents actually parenting. think problem bad centers, advocate improved child care resources. think problem cost living allow parents stay home kids, advocate higher wages affordable housing standards. article working mothers disproportionately impacted pandemic, jump make judgement working anyway home kids. know serious reads like subtitles beginning Monty Python Holy Grail. ad hominem ridiculous atm dude need stress guaranteed ultimate spreading capabilities like regular covid (which means ASYMPTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HUMANS)

/u/blazingsaint idea. curious though. COVID respiratory illness sure it'd threat day two minks dead. Viruses mutate easily spread, deadly matter unless affects ability spread. COVID, spread happens symptomatically patients die week ICU, evolutionary pressure become less deadly currently is.

What give huge evolutionary advantage resistance existing anti-bodies covid-19 confirmed numerous different animal species mammals, birds, reptiles.  way contain virus environmental reservoirs like that.

It's yearly vaccines, antiviral/antibody treatments, we're dead. It‚Äôs mostly bought Chinese wanna blame opportunity ""Danish Flu"" unnecessary. unable find scientific articles corona's long term effects except indications. fair, I'm reasonably certain answer actually ""we know yet"", commentor said lot long term effects known thought maybe *I* know yet

Anyway, find flu, well-researched subject, do-able. Frankly, manage show long-term effects scary, end lockdown wish would stop long winter narrative, depressing Minks

It's virus.

""Coronavirus"" class many. cramming thousands animals small space things need, simply exploit profit, good idea comes viral mutation. *for Taiwan China Right, sources, clearly see money creation happens nation like US. Money marked Fed accounts according authority imposed Congress. much ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù taken taxes.

You mention yourself, backing dollar US‚Äôs ‚Äúcredit federal reserve.‚Äù

To (and many economists mentioned) seems clear funding done legislative authority, tax ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù deficits primary concern. inflation impact real resources. 

You‚Äôre looking lens ‚Äúbalanced budget‚Äù approach? so, reconcile exemptions military spending ignore rules like ‚ÄúPayGo‚Äù etc? :( Adding top everything that's already said bad: mutate another fur farmed species, may make difficult (if impossible) save fur farm animals via rescues. Millions animal lives completely wasted. welcome. question healthcare provider, beyond advice giving qualifications ;-) point, say get recommendations, test discuss results them. [CDC saying \[severely\] might take 10-20 days symptoms appearing clear virus. sound like situation 10 days normally sufficient mild symptoms normal immune system, consulting expert would safest way go. 

From heard/read...if test positive (after know virus) still shedding virus probably infectious. Err side caution.

Never give hope, keeps us fighting. also eat animals! Whoa, right? Thanks, Denmark. like enough worry fuck that's fucking sad. One key difference ;

""Could please stay home Covid-20 kinda dangerous?""

Is less effective containment than

""Fuck shit I'm gonna weld door place one gets out, hope y'all alive 14 days""

Human rights issue china, set minds something Whoever buys mink coat days cunt. barbarism needed end 50 years ago Wussy lol. Wow, brought back middle school lol. blocked. sad bizarre Can't even finish first pandemic new strain weasels in. interesting write something incredibly morbid odd. Thank you!  allows us draw 2 conclusions.

1- even better treatment understanding virus we're still getting many deaths statistically younger population *(well, mean , killed elders spring remember) .* So, we're faced greater spread virus .

2-The virus hotspots less concentrated Spring , virus travelled EVERYWHERE . DESPITE USE MASKS! Imagine mask mandate already...

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, pretty grim. Stricter restrictions without lockdown happened weeks ago... Seeing timeline different time ...

Honestly, businesses would take fall, doubt it. businesses simply CANNOT work pandemic gotten better cushion governments. part.

But least UK , oh god... understand incompetence current government , god... can't bad sheer incompetence . , delve ""conspiracies"" ... stop here...

The reason light tunnel Vaccines may start rolling December...

The biggest reason concern found new strain coronavirus Denmark [Denmark: Mutated coronavirus mink threat humans : Coronavirus 

pfff.... UK's BoJo freaking dumbass playing lives everyone honestly probably thinks politics game Brexit Pandemic response phase. He's definitely serving public's interest... wonder who's . Ive seen many dead birds year. Dozens dozens pigeons, crackles, etc.. laying street. Never seen anything like it. Always wondered infected. prefer able eat meat living pandemic? Actually probably stop eating meat completely, decrease large degree. 

If could stop industrial animal farming much smarter general working animals, would likely situation now. Pretty much pandemics caused virus spreads animals humans, settings like animal farms/markets. demand meat fur crazy high, could maybe avoid happening again, least lot less frequently. /r/theydidthemath ? üò≥ sounds like ""all did"" train existing neural network. create it.. fed info.. .. implementation coughing phone.. user could log daily, cough phone, instantly get information whether might infected therefore confirm formal test.

Something tells disinfecting fur adequate enough Gosh darn it, zombie virus 2021! Username checks Given lot countries able contact trace properly months we've never heard situation before, I'd willing bet big issue (for human transmission, anyway) - first off, needs animal reservoir (like 17M minks) spread virus something seagull often interacts with, needs spread something humans interact with. really well documented mass-infections animals are, far I've heard, Mink. Cats (rarely) get it, mink apparantly hotbed stuff.

Given we're culling mink, holland too, soon something able happen *WAS* happened. would rather get gassed get throat cut. Lol Bro shut already keep getting downvoted reason. quiet wussy.

Nobody saying vaccine perfect, trust researchers McDonald's PhD idiots day. Blocked. Cool, thank you! Spent four hours line get covid test morning I‚Äôve developed sporadic cough 4 days flying. Rapid test negative, high incidence false negative right? Gotta wait 3-5 days PCR. Damn right, brain smooth. keep debates civil calm. root problem vast amount shitty sailors? Yes. That's saying. Idk thought saying taxes pay MIT. 1. course it‚Äôs catastrophe almost 6000 deaths since March. I‚Äôm seeing anyone say otherwise. you?
2. US catastrophe bigger Swedish one, keen comparisons. 6 000 deaths compared 233 000. want per 100 000: 59 Sweden compared 70 US. bright side maybe enough economic damage mink farmers mink fur industry shuts down? difficult choice God bless Denmark taking hit protect people warmest furr almost animals. need shit scandinavia life lived

I'm pretty sure absolutely good thing view mink. heck wants live weeks months longer means standing thin wire way small cages thing enrichment spin around circles? Industrial animal ag life. I'd shocked would choose suffer longer guaranteed killed either way. That's drawing physical psychological pain.

My question death less humane would been. Electrocution using prods inserted mouth asshole common mess fur, many alternatives likely ""kind"". hand, like States something like ventilation shut (imagine trapped steam sauna kills you, there's also videos online want watch), may barbaric. hope...but mean there's strain vaccines anything against, spread like wildfire still kill people.

I hope future. think odds enjoyable, thriving life gone this.

I'm sick fucking tired staying home masking distancing...it's natural. are.

Contagion contagion contagion seems.

This push back Fauci's Q3-2021 ""return normal"" estimate least year. can't work current vaccines. They'd likely need start scratch...unless there's something I'm missing.

But time drags on...it's hard want end life. hope read this. don't. blue here, smooth brain I'm sure everyone wisconsin wearing mask.

Problem solved. really different wet markets China. disgusting unnecessary. say ""the virus"" proof mink virus shoot one trying develop vaccine for? virus fighting, best guess originated bats jumped humans. could entirely different virus happens occurring simultaneously.

Now playing devils advocate well, reports Cats testing positive pandemic causing coronavirus Minks fall Phylum cats, tigers, etc.

Coronavirus type virus (same colds), actual name we're fighting believe Sars-Cov-2 Minks: Final Boss 2020 old article? Everything find one month already?  Ok... scale fuck crap, screwed we? press conference?  aren‚Äôt aware common knowledge disease?

Just FYI- post subreddit 194 days ago[doctors warn virus causing blood clots sudden strokes healthy young point know - doctors know this. It‚Äôs common knowledge.  Hey, November 4th, come fake covid news still coming out?

/s Yes prion takes like 600c destroy corona probably dead 60c.  Yo, it‚Äôs 10 times deadlier flu bro. Jeez. located?  There's theory origin wet market anyway

Which factory farmed animals stacked cages pissing shitting people buy food

Depends believe one bat one. Mink derived strains sars-cov-2 spreading enormously rural population breeders want put sick mink down. new mutation sars-cov-2 found 12 humans far. worry US left out! name there? papers. fairly easy find Congress choose put whatever money want, responsible figuring pay back. That‚Äôs can‚Äôt give Americans 1000 dollars every month without repercussions also bail big business stimulus packages. adds national deficit find ways pay back. 

I‚Äôm it, figure it. easy print hand money without back would done corona virus relief.

So basically everything said initially UBI affecting inflation true, becomes problem US can‚Äôt come funds. read somewhere European minks verge getting extinct meanwhile american minks sort danger like that. think killing 17 million natural habitat depressing manner. call patient dies could saved proper care?

In ordinary circumstances : Negligence  
But current circumstance : Bad luck. already infected minks mutated, imagine else currently mutating around world. Let's hope plan incinerate alive. surprised though. :( permit pass me. gone past turn inner eye see path. Well... fucking Nazis told people gassing Jews indeed would cure world... gotcha, found really funny lol I‚Äôm saying admitted. I‚Äôm saying warned stages illness least. know places giving blood thinners prophylactically. brother says, getting better. Sounds like idea stages disease.

Edit: take wasn‚Äôt monitored. never said admitted. staying home voluntarily second waves places like Brazil refused lockdown again? poor minks fucked either way. Fur farms evil. Horry shit authorities found virus strains humans mink showed decreased sensitivity antibodies, potentially lowering efficacy future vaccines...

Thank God happen US. Nothing would done here. Pretty sure minks don‚Äôt get break getting fur farmed Mink farms illegal worldwide anyway. heard new Coronavirus mosquitos. get response? Mother nature determined get rid humanity.  Viral classification kinda weird system viruses aren‚Äôt living organisms. Different serotypes result minor genetic variation generally binding proteins virus. new species would require mutation two viruses. lines blurry though.

So go home. hope don‚Äôt bounce back worse condition. dead. Dude Trump syndrome. Jesus. No, mink live countries also could disinfect it. waste. Doubtful small *and* detectable sewage, wasn‚Äôt NYC March huge. /r/theydidthemath Polish government collapsed. longer contribute future cure progress.
Ofc jk. going serious economic setback.. Dead either way agree this. Several places hospital beds ICU's nearly full, non sever cases would sent away. Hmm... Radiation may increase rate mutations... opens possibilities... Halfway first peak now. :(  Covid-20: Tokyo Drift short strict lockdown better economy slow, drawn reopening fluctuating levels restrictions makes businesses non-viable anyways
And know... guess whole saving lives things pretty cool Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* honesty industry don‚Äôt mind seeing go. agree you. I‚Äôm saying dude replied going something fictional. become dominant strain that. seems legit unlikely happen.

Obviously taking precautions, strains evolving human transmission like D614G likely better suited dominant here, variations tailor-made maximize transmission people. new corona virus harmless? happened know strains previous covids circulating animal populations? swede (I assume) makes easier take complaints seriously. stake game probably feel equally sad disgusted read things played spring. Let's get upset eachother. end want things (roughly üôÇ). Gov make illegal kill mink way except head shot hand gun made available free anyone wants participate. Great Danish Mink Hunt go history books spirits get high knows else happen?! seem implying goal keep people locked time. assure goal. may necessary intermediate step keep infection rates we're able deal things, think politician actually wants lock everybody houses time. None affected outer proteins

There way know sure amount times virus mutated already. knew vaccine would much hit miss. least develop vaccine one strain works, likely alter quickly affect new type well, take another 1-2 years. Dogs also infected least Hong Kong Belgium, probably places now. Damn, minks pretty similar ferrets right? Wonder anything ther  ah! know unno, think experience SARS mutations far, ""Animal-Product Sourced Outbreak"" free square. used look phylogeny Spring NextStrain easier lot less sequences. noticed D614G mutation seemed important took least month mention media pre-prints. people calling facts misinformation fear mongering, yes 4+ million cows killed UK try eradicate bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease, prion), minks cake. downvoted downvoting them. also upvoted post read comment thought interesting informative, I'm changing official reason upvoting OP ""just downvoted them"". submitted paperwork spez. already circulating human population, that's closing barn door years horse got out. Borders still open, new measures. Correct. ""This crazy fast."" need remember vaccine longest developed. Oh ffs fucked mink! Well depending spreads.

Covid-19 called first huge infection spread Hong Kong china 2019.

If new version virus spreads 2020 yes would call covid 20.

However, since 2020 almost likely called covid-2021 minks dead, region lockdown people elsewhere masked up. might restrictions, really hope manage contain it. else western world going keep us locked up?.... animal reservoirs, never end. Vaccinations not. Covid over, right? least 12 people already infected. knows far already spread? mink farms countries, too. Yaaa.

There lots mutations there.

For significant, become dominant mutation.

Since evolved humans Mink, seems human mutations would higher candidates find dominance total population. advantages med dominance tailor made humans. Catapult corpses enemy‚Äôs drinking water. Well, bugger. fuckin knew coming JFC. year keeps getting weirder worse time. source? Nah we‚Äôre bunch keyboard warriors UK world need stop threating animals laike way does. think extract resources, waked whe shut thes farms, minks, almost every place use animals slaves. payback expoiting nature. Stay alert cases like those. Hopefully furry animals home wont spread virus, could moment. virus keep mutating! It‚Äôs thread unbelievable tool lol South Park episode? didn‚Äôt think pangolin shown intermediary seems European countries don‚Äôt mind sacrificing minks name contagion. 

I worry US mink farmers might willing Yep. one teacher insists people coming class (in computer lab tiny can‚Äôt clean) ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier‚Äù dude learn job better. Either ways much export fur going slashed almost minks getting culled right? unnecessary, I'm speaking economic terms, I'm speaking ethical terms. affected regions go back full lockdown - never full lockdown. New restrictions announced tomorrow, expected relatively minor changes. announcement curfew, school shutdown, business shutdown, ban private parties, similar lockdown-style measures. HARK WINSLOW!!! Luckily tomorrow, plenty time escape quarantine. Dude‚Äôs easy trigger, lol. gov mass slaughtering/gassing livestock. received much attention. haven't, one particular opposition party held responsible constantly going media government leave mink-farms alone. Latest new fear Denmark new center world wide coronavirus 2.0 pandemic - like Wuhan 1.0.

Let's hope contained happens. Yup around time spread globally least European countries, though? significant numbers, mean reads like scrolls Plague Inc. ex two pets, treated pets. Imagine minks cats dogs source virus mutation, goverment would decide exterminate every single one them. Say want irresponsible, I'm giving pets extermination. None affected outer proteins. threat mutation current vaccines work it. may less deadly itself, unless literally cold really dangerous. Probably? shit coronavirus covid-20 2021? Fuck Schools well. We've destroyed economy watched grandparents die, learn nothing repeat mistakes second wave. extremely silly, know several people Germans training say German military excellent quality. Generally think people becoming way used making minds things, without really taking time research it. 

At least count discipline military. seems like *a lot* civilians became deserters fast, everyone suddenly drafted fight enemy cannot targeted firearms. Welp, probably late considering already spread humans COVID control Europe while.

And even get miraculously contained, shows COVID potential mutate form defeat current vaccines + reinfect everyone. spread humans reaching 50 million soon signs slowing, probability something like emerging elsewhere going get higher.

Flu shots keep yearly mutation R0 flu high enough outpace vaccine development. COVID grows critical mass, rate mutation outpace vaccines, point solution left extreme lockdown + mass test + eradication... that's beyond ability countries earth. told actual mutation is? Something like two letters numbers in-between (e.g. D614G). assume spike protein mutated. Even cutting one meat-as-main-course meal per week makes diffewrence. Nobody go all-in. Herd immunity would likely take effect long 90% unless people acted zero regards catching virus, even so, spreading virus 10x number people already gives virus 10x chances mutate something new. There's also possibility fading immunity. Herd immunity via infections always terrible approach take. good pets (wilder ferrets). Bitey bitey. animals may, farm hog density mink (just size wise). probably infected one mink, infect one on. ""mass"" infected population made possible new strain. single isolated cat chance produce new strain even infect human back. 
Density, proximity, similarity... large scale farming subject create new strain (swine flu, avian flu...) sound lame. Like flustered. uses perfect grammar reddit lol

/u/blazingsaint look forget, changed mind making counterpoint decided question instead failed make point 

Fiction, blatantly false btw be? Yes. be? Probably not, stop one already have. 12 known cases humans strain already.  Sadly, damaging economy government seem care permanently abolish mink farms? NJ. Got sprung quarantine Monday night negative test. Feeling fortunate hell feel enemy closing family/friend/work circles. 

COVID sucks. Oh I'm alarmed alrighty burn them. already contracted additional incinerators, ones enough. Fire Rises üî• one eat fucking mink, okay? Hah! know, still 2020? argument (and should) applied factory farming operations. terribly destructive environment, pose enormous biohazard threat humanity massive resovoirs potential viral bacterial pathogens. Super bugs joke.  


Also animals cute, (probably) conscious, junk. people agree aren‚Äôt concern mine lol. mentality do, 6 year old. proved grammar punctuation lol. 

Don‚Äôt forget, changed mind making counterpoint decided question instead failed make point all. Little baby, go cry somewhere else loser  thing covid long u bounced back u Daegu Patient 31 situation 

One person tank ur containment commonly agreed guide treating home can't get hospital? Please don't. wonder time find already late [the state set field guess that's answer. Stay open fill field hospital patients, morgue bodies. Mutated Mink Corona November? bro love swallowing cockmeat make sound like unprovoked denouncing Danish response. would love find recording pressconference see said context. would assume response question journalist. agree agencies refrain criticizing countries. see helpful. Atleast seems correct hard Danish response might politically motivated necessarily based recommendations public health agency, prime minister think one reason important quick pass judgment decisions taken spring indicated this. Let's assume Sundhetsstyrelsen Folkh√§lsomyndigheten point same, well researched thought level response based best available data. PM Denmark takes another path based fear political pressure instance. end outcome better Denmark. made correct decision? would argue Sweden. play lottery win, smart move? forgot also carried around seagulls, making possible disease spread even total lockdown countries. Oh that's too. tend brief. proven protests led outbreaks, exclude excuse. Agreed, are. escape countries. mink breeders hide move breeding pairs washes over, causing mutated virus spread, like African Swine Fever.

Poland's government almost collapsed last month [wouldn't ban mink Shit. never end reason panic yet; let's see Danish center figured antibody evasion first...

If used monoclonal antibodies, might problem treatments developped far, necessarily hinderance vaccines.

Our bodies produce polyclonal antibodies + cell immunity might well enough stop mutation too.

(hell, even know vaccines work much what, say might *not* work sounds really far-fetched ""doom-sciency"" me...)

(+ (paper came new mutation though)) Well I‚Äôm sure learned everything right proper first mutation right?! /s Would thing found dogs? draw line? China communist, lol. Glad defining animal abuse legality think we'd better voted people longer us. TEACHERS. scheduled return Tuesday area 6 percent positivity rate. Terrified begin describe it. Pathetic human human race ends Fuck year No. Denmark corrupt country. government would never get away case. !RemindMe 1 year people eat mink? Serious question. Wow, looked measures taken even distance learning schools older students recommendation, mostly followed assume recommendation still.

Banning gatherings 500 people?

Forbidding visits nursing homes?

Its interesting Tegnell &amp; co never said could impose stricter lockdown instead told ""these durable long term measures"" said ""in Sweden, things bit differently"". Waiting obligatory uninformed comment get downvoted oblivion using covid skeptic bingo talking *But cost economy?*  *But fight winter (lack understanding northern southern hemisphere seasons)*  *All tyranny loss freedom worth it! (despite state supporting lock measures).*  *Covid kills 0.001% people hoax.* Even industrial cows need b12 tablets shots. Reason feed food (vegetables) stripped b12 producing bacteria cleaning cooking process.

So ignored peddle ""human need meat!"" argument. Maybe human also live cave, then. write Herd immunity 2: minks Best year ever Read article maybe Can't wait go back Tuesday!! Especially since students telling Halloween parties attended families. time return spread sickness. pigs Australia, including raised ‚Äúfree range‚Äù, killed **carbon dioxide gas**

The description video clearly states actually example [inert gas begin with. 

What's more, animals shown quite obviously understandably distressed confinement gassing actually takes place. That's completely separate issue one comment replying actually addressed. 

I'm sorry, honest, here. true? mean assume Danish premier smart enough know? It‚Äôs like covid asked us : right farm animals ? That's stuff haha. Thank fair exactly crystal clear point. Swedish article question Tegnell actually means says herd immunity. apparently already Croatia, could anywhere. also possible mutation happened already earlier somewhere else. Impossible say without knowing mutation is. Oh no!

Anyway... straight false‚Äî ‚Äúlie wait like herpes virus‚Äù. mechanism could lurk nerve cells resurface later Stupid minks wearing mask. Bruh god really releasing Corona virus 2  get sufficient b12 vegetables. know nutritionist? No. 
And say die, get sick. probably lacking actually. 
I'm going argue none sub know better drs person actually lacks b12 witnessed others lacking b12. carry on. Nomenclature question: Mutations still Covid-19, like flu, right? are. - they‚Äôre locking North Jutland. mean, already jumped cats dogs far cases somewhat rare. accurate lol. math work that? Serious question. thought insults lol. baby, go cry somewhere else lol Maybe get one control, Denmark addresses directly instead trying cover initially like China did.

I faith Denmark. mess around first time handled first waves well. Besides, know population drops certain number Sweden try take Sj√¶lland. that's enough incentive act quickly.  really know two people harassed. one weak man second time complain something you‚Äôve overlooked first comment. came right thing missed:

‚ÄúCopenhagen Municipality 7.018 pr. km¬≤ Stockholm Municipality 5.690 pr. km¬≤

.... according Swedish Danish Wikipedia.‚Äù

It‚Äôs experience stats correct national Wikipedia. go, it‚Äôs called would Facebook browsing League Legends fan saying Peta. time. probably understood given context. ^_^  new news able transmitted back humans.

No, happened mink first infected coronavirus handlers April. government identified two cases humans infected sick animals May, animal-to-human transmissions known since global outbreak began indicates persons Covid-19 infect animals, cases reverse identified Europe. **In May, government identified two cases humans infected sick animals.** time, animal-to-human transmissions known since global outbreak began China. know. makes daily life fun /s. never leave house anymore I‚Äôm immune compromised, missing basically everything farm minks might well good ecosystem afaik nativ tend way well escape farms, so.my guess would plus wildlife compete escapees. Damn, also Netherlands. Many mink farms infected aren‚Äôt even considering this. What‚Äôs wrong you? wish anyone terrible. link opinion piece good enough evidence must also believe covid exist. Looks like COVID-20 already arrived want thank Denmark taking unprecedented difficult step protect world. Well, current pandemic you. Someone makes mistake something wrong? problem well. Sheesh, almost 2% population tested positive one day? Well....at least keep long. yuck. thanks voting correctly! That‚Äôs am, really specifically answers question thanks! great news, need mass cull humans take place. There's simply many us now. German government predict 30k cases end week, literally pulled number ass.

[English-based (one multiple) claimed Merkel expected us hit 30k cases week Free speech allowed anymore? God save queen playing DnD rolling 1s make app identifies COVID cell phone use informs asymtomatic probable infection also notifies local health officials it'd alot easier get handle pandemic. point Switzerland might first reach goes on. weekly basis see patients Covid. wife's GP sees several day even though they're ordered isolate home.

That's tests ""dummy"" actually distributed Russia. get pendantic said ""memory cells"" basic term learned high school.

The pedantry nothing ""memory cells"" going ""huh uh, months, weeks. ""Probably couple weeks"" absolutely wrong.

Grow keep mouth shut unless actually know something. us doesn‚Äôt print money federal reserve does, print based US asks for. think you‚Äôre missing point. government cannot hand 2 trillion dollars year continuously without way pay back. there‚Äôs way pay back end deficit. continue long we‚Äôll hole could never recover from. 

So want put money economy via monetary policies. want find new program via taxes. walls echo chamber telling right means absolutely nothing. Grow up, go back studying little boy Denmark democrats. made way get back Trump election. Ah, Denmark. going bring children watch slaughter?

Many minks got killed Oh sad think about. Although know raised anyways. Frankly I'm hoping encourages mink farmers leave business raising mink slaughter. Read article, says antibodies produced people got infected mutation probably important cat get owner noone else infected Warm 2021 boys cute. look like little otters No, significant mutation (in terms interference vaccination process) you‚Äôre saying lethal table still 2021? still many cases per day, positive rate went every week (now 7%) 2/3 country hotspot. take look hospital cases, soon reached peak spring. think R number less significant, get idea current situation estimation. know anyone stated circulation rodent species concern. Mice rats farms get feed enclosures go elsewhere amongst human dwellings could issue. thing circulates mutates god knows transform into. One point obviously mutates rapidly....so mean vaccine hopes?

Someone used genetic reshuffle understanding trafficked animals Chinese wet market caught wild, bred captivity, pretty much unregulated. risk pangolin human transmission pangolins humans never close contact, pangolin species endangered poorly captivity conservation reason interact scales meat valuable black market China. Meta. tests dummy covers nowhere near enough people actually effect whole country, also get pendantic said ""memory cells"" basic term learned high school.

Also Europe seeing second wave, probably due winter, countries test vaccines massive coincidence? tools called ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù reason, started insult lost argument. Lol. You‚Äôre truly ignorant, it‚Äôs astonishing time died late replace another candidate announced party would appoint another individual party fill seat. People basically voting party. Yes, talking ass. Covid 19.0.2 ""Handwashing, masks limiting contact outside immediate family..""

I wash hands, work isolation except ten minute hand next guy. family never see friends, months anyway. 

It's going Charlton Heston thing over. Mink farms involved people already sucked hard. Australia tracking genetics carefully. also massive continuous effort track every case every person possibly contact.  Yup.. animal agriculture problem behind pretty much previous pandemics.

But meat eaters ignore us. another pandemic breaks animal agriculture Tell mink-farmers. Public opinion mink farms least 2 decades. agricultural sector allied second largest political party, difficult prevent thing. im working program texas. calls going el paso last week. insane. Madagascar closed ports early on, doing? big mystery coronavirus spread markedly among mink farms may come step closer University Copenhagen, coronavirus found feet ""Getting clarified important thing prevent farms becoming infected prevent spread infection. important thing know moves,"" says Anne Sofie Vedsted Hammer, associate professor veterinarian Department Veterinary Animal Science University Copenhagen, media. took 5/6 months able go stairs house without gasping breath. take slow easy.  Lol. fellow Dane, he's got point though. isn‚Äôt true. spreading since summer. It‚Äôs Denmark. 

Minks Utah, Wisconsin, Michigan also coronavirus, though don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs worse strain not. culled minks Covid-19 rates go temperatures get colder lower humidity makes easier aerosol (as well prevents breaking air fast). That's reason meat packing plants huge outbreaks. then, Philly really cold.

Even though guarantee although likely rates go up, going fixated rate daily schedule year. It'll source constant stress. reschedule, also worry about, might end money.

Why put worry position easily mitigate it? might even schedule June.. least wait early next year start discussing schedule better idea winter like.

That said, surgery finally gets scheduled, hope goes incredibly well! Perhaps something like maximum one pill pr. day, medication puts strain organs virus :/  Dude need step back realize insulted every person proved wrong multiple times like turrets internet, sane people dude. I'm talking well-known well-documented facts fuck talking about?

The people testing positive today infected 2 weeks ago. virus stays system long time possibly start showing symptoms. going long enough pattern emerge. 

I really want assume complete idjit, possible know that. restrictions put place today show benefit least two weeks longer. say follow mainstream media, agree, news sources would say best kind topic? find amazing said scales universe, too.

Predicting individual atom molecule? Near impossible. substance whole predictable properties. direct result that. Lessethal recall G variant substitutes glycerine molecule whatever originally spike. enabled better penetration cells nothing otherwise changed virus.

It seems mink virus least infectious original virus evolved bats. far one outcompeting another, new mink version may well dominant strain new infections, could well dominate reinfections previous cases. 

Of course speculative, one study one institute incredibly preliminary.

It concerning though. compare bird flu, bird flu normally able transmit humans different receptors people birds. bird flu transmit pigs, pigs receptors common people. So, bird flu mutate pigs jump people. really know went inside mink. 

It reminds quite bit Carl Bergstrom back new pathogen enters human population, unlikely adapted maximize transmission. might virulent, mild. Basically, old thing could happen, depending mutations arise first.

This are: old thing happened. I‚Äôm literally outside right lol, fucking loser lol  love pile burning sheep morning double edged sword medication damage kidney also risk virus. Thankfully, annihilates Danish fur business. ""why hell still farming animals fur 2020"", also mink Covid infections observed since May. Uh, maybe, stop? maybe stop? Scientists warning back virus mutate jump back humans. stop. culled couple million, kept it. kill all, plus get new pandemic Covid-20. 

Whenever opportunity mess up, messed up. going enjoy benefits 2030. Denmark: *Farms minks

The rest world: **We here.** hadn‚Äôt heard it‚Äôs article. get info? wish case, also comes personal responsibility. Pritzker one aggressive governors terms trying reduce spread, look gotten Illinois.  actually spelled mink Hopefully kills fur industry. poor creatures. Send Thyholm! can't wait mink farms shut forever. Maybe government took steps prevent deaths. Yeah right 0.7% something. get infected fresh produce, lethal dose, human immune system help you. far contained north Limfjorden. yeah.... Even though going fuck 2020 even kind agree. Problem half population can't even put mask without baby it. Wuhan style lockdown would lead straight civil war fear Right!?!? News stations barely started covering January spreading well December.  though? Mink Right minks! DAE America third world country? I'm much better countrymen. Although shudder think countrymen. College epidemiologist Neil] Ferguson behind disputed research sparked mass culling eleven million sheep cattle 2001 outbreak foot-and-mouth disease. also predicted 150,000 people could die. fewer 200 deaths. . . 2002, Ferguson predicted 50,000 people would likely die exposure BSE (mad cow disease) beef.

Ferguson declined release original code scientists could check results. released heavily revised set code last week, six-week real scandal is: anyone ever listen guy? Denmark exports mink fur China. China needs stop creating viruses world. Election yet, go away recounts done /s century. bad fucking useless  mom threat humans ayoooo Im sorry...what? think might misread statement. Yes, people right saying it‚Äôll magically disappear November 3rd think meant either way goes, confused. Probably people swept rug places like retirement homes somebody threatened blow lid. I'd expect ""revisions"" like come following months van call Cinks - stay Denmark - pigs. January 2020 12.7 million pigs, twice many Danish citizens. couple things note.

At press briefing, K√•re M√∏lbak SSI said strain found mink *less* response existing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. added still *does* respond them; ""just grow freely exposed antibodies"", use wording (although, course, said Danish) - also added cellular immunity seem affected. concern immediately destroyed vaccine hopes (remember vaccine candidates produce much higher antibody titres natural infection, *and* also induce cellular immunity) - concern keeps replicating mutating unchecked, might turn something does. mink killed affected part country stricter measures imposed tomorrow (what exactly announced yet). Gene sequencing infections surrounding areas also intensified, track spread.

The news outlet non-Danish-speaking Reddit responding basically Danish tabloid. said anything that's outright false, they've bit creative reporting: ""lessened response"" mutated ""only weak response"", example. news hit Reddit, mutated ""no response"". 2021 get historically lower. industry likely wont recover, even compensation. makes ""dangerous"" would render current efforts useless, lead unnecessary deaths future. looks like mink population next nothing soon... That's fucking crazy. feel bad people even dumb ass trump supporting idiots. least one thing critisised closing borders, happened. answer journalist. I'm going look source. Even though government could reacted bit earlier, feel like great job handling pandemic, maybe first vaccinations start December January, amazing. Next week numbers could go even more, maybe 10.000 new cases starting sound Plague Inc day.

""Oh, airplane traffic nearly halted?""

""Avians next"" joke. Ive seen hundreds saying disappear election. night incredibly popular brought lot additionally scary thing believe seagulls spreading disease farm farm. people think put crematoriums garbage incenerators? Come lmao ah, doesn't, move goalpost next? multiple type antibodies produced different antigens, talking Ig g Ig Ig a, Ig g antibodies testing ones specific spike protein found 20% patients , reason think vaccine rendered useless.

We jump panic gun ! No, claim social distancing simply true. admit account guidelines gave first comment bit simplified, largely correct. 

So, first all, true we're pretty good job testing lot people. That's good. But, recommended distance people 1 meter ‚Äì half recommended distance lot countries. regardless, keeping distance 1 meter pupils schools *recommendation* ‚Äì recommendation impractical follow, schools *can* ignore it. That's exactly sister's school, classrooms small. again, masks required classrooms. There's reason kids aged 10-19 group cases Denmark moment. Lol r u going want stay indoors forever call coward

/u/blazingsaint Wtf 2020 

Also Reuters article worst case scenario new pandemic, starting Denmark,‚Äù director State Serum Institute, Kare Molbak, said. new strain showed diminished sensitivity towards antibodies, added. That‚Äôs take extremely seriously,‚Äù Molbak said.‚Äù 19.99 get additional Covid-22!! price 1 Covid-19! incredibly responsible clear headed. Holy shit gut wrenching I'm glad taking step. Auschwitz minks. Also, think fact top 1% people buying MINK fur... nationwide lockdown stay home order military enforcing week ago. Anything less Wuhan lockdown insanity. Germany, calculated positive tests only. lol, election ever ends! could outsource cremation jobs China. understand crematoriums passed quite stress test ten months ago. US would like 7600 deaths day. That‚Äôs good hear. Honestly, could anywhere, USA point. Nobody thinks that? Also worth pointing authorities known issue months without anything, mutated variant long crossed early 4 September, SSI \[Danish CDC analogue\] wrote risk assessment ""a special mink variant"" virus spread mink farm local population North Jutland far away Bornholm Croatia. particular variant mutated around specific protein virus called ‚Äòspike‚Äô. protein ""that vaccine candidates targeting,"" risk assessment Less 1% exports. worth risk. 25,042 cases(US equivalent 175,294)today big increase 11/2's 18,340, yesterdays 18,669 give us much much credit.. lot people stupid ignorant Americans

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) ‚Äî rare recognition Taiwan's existence, top World Health Organization (WHO) official lauded country's handling Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

In Guardian published Monday (Nov. 2), spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris explained organization recommend countries implement full lockdowns coronavirus cases skyrocket U.S. Europe. Instead, Harris recommended testing, contact tracing, quarantining example highlighted Taiwan's use techniques avoid lockdown altogether.

Although officials Tedros Adhanom Bruce Aylward lavished praise China early pandemic alleged results extreme lockdown Wuhan, organization maintained lockdowns something last resort. Instead, stated Harris, advocating isolation: ""That's isolation people sick ‚Äî isolation people contacts first-degree contacts.""

Unlike Aylward's awkward [moment asked Taiwan's membership WHO, Harris proactively praised Taiwan ""the best management."" However, tinged labeling Taiwan one Asian ""economies"" contained virus better, clear attempt avoid Chinese angst Taiwan's status country.

Harris chose Taiwan dispel myth ""non-liberal, non-democratic command economies"" control pandemic pointing fact ""definitely highly liberal society."" emphasized lockdowns come price avoiding requires ""a lot planning. requires lot great deal partnership community local authorities...""

Indeed, Taiwan began planning pandemic learned hard lesson SARS 17 years ago, starting establishment permanent National Health Command Center (NHCC) 2004. reports atypical pneumonia cases Wuhan started stream in, Taiwan Dec. 31 last year contacted Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention World Health Organization (WHO) IHR focal point clarify whether human-to-human transmission occurring Wuhan.

However, responded short message stating Taiwan's information would ""forwarded expert colleagues,"" China issued press release. result, Taiwan unable receive confirmation either Chinese channels human-to-human transmission taking place.

Therefore, government went ahead launched enhanced border control quarantine measures ""based assumption human-to-human transmission fact occurring,"" according Jan. 20, CECC activated, Minister Health Welfare Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) helm.

Steps taken CECC day forward key eliminating local coronavirus infections Taiwan 205 days counting. Examples include canceling entry permits tourists Wuhan, implementing mandatory quarantines visitors, imposing total ban foreign travelers, setting name-based mask rationing system, using cellphone data enforce quarantines, carrying extensive contact tracing. That's kind I'm thinking too. we'll never actually vaccine virus mutate. let thought marinate ... bleaker things look. We're ready another virus. cupboards left bare previous administration! Something rotten state Denmark. Shai-Hulud approves science guys, viruses likely evolve extreme way (extreme enough vaccine useless) animal human makes difference? Google help question. someone grew fur industry, yes. Yes, is. Apparently people wear mink fur, year 2020 effing materials make clothes from. Covid-20. *Oh no...* I'm certain dead serious 100Percent *We've Covid-19, yes. Covid-20?* coincidental years ago wrote story virus carried stoats, family. research scary now, retrospect, familiar. :(

Stoats brought plagues past, fairly recently Ahh back door route, popular parts world well, specially Asia Luckily people live closely 50000 caged bats though. density close contact vulnerable animal population. instance swine bird flu often arise pig fowl farms. Kill Minks? Minks cute won‚Äôt villainized like bats. interesting play WHOOOO YOU? WHO, WHO? Oh, fantastic.... covid 2.0  nuke place? Tired society taking risks. comment really going age well, like fine wine. Asia, problem. Europe? Denmark tiny country. single nuke fix problem. Could increase common cold infections similar symptoms. Could actual huge drop coronavirus cases... Free mink coats everyone? clicking link either, lol Fucking hell, 2 moths end 2020... 2020 gonna 2020. Ah makes sense. Damn. Yes. Yes. Yes, also feet.

This beyond awesome margin. Mink routinely fed antibiotics make grow faster major cause concern, since likely spread Antimicrobial resistance humans. annihilation loooong overdue. can't read Danish. new deadlier strain? spreading human human already, mink farm workers? Lmfao

Hospital literally overrun, doctors dying left right. Hmmmmm Thanks üëç Also CDC guy asked covid20. responded
""It takes internal committee name virus...."" would think pro-life people would yapping trying pass laws force everyone wear masks since yap abortion end life stuff want force laws fit agendas everyone. agree, better die quick live heart breaking conditions. Good luck country good luck us. get kill seagulls. Im fine this. business? effect involving yourself?

Uh... statements apply well? Don‚Äôt know. risk effect worst case occur

Can someone translate properly? Farm workers usually working multiple farms (although neighbors helping ordinary). 

The article ( ) says feet seagull - probably stood mink-shit carried it, mink-farms (given already well established covid lives waste). 

An alternative theory sending government workers document mink farms/measures weeks back, could transmitted unhealthy healthy populations, people travelling farms. It‚Äôs capitalism. typo priceless! Made smile even though news bad. Thanks! Iron Maiden start penning new epic. agree that. hope mink covid strain spread much can't contained anymore. Maybe vaccine trials people mink farms would good idea. Hey technically election, winner hasn‚Äôt decided yet Lubach saw coming (has English CC) national plan distribute States? seen published anywhere? depends preference - cd vinyl record....i hear wax phonograph cylinders making comeback.... kill chickens really easily Hopefully contain N√∏rrejyske √∏ aka total lockdown everything north Limfjorden can't see spreading without total lockdown area, however harsh sounds. can't really afford take risks now. I'm disappointed government announce solution today. can't really trust people remain self isolated. 

Fucking 2020..... Underwear expensive... Anyone paying attention knew 100% possibility. Coronaviruses common, genetic crossover well established. Whether dramatically transmissible, higher IFR, otherwise seen. 

This likely first detected cross-over event, last. possible things eased here. went 250 day across whole country summer 10 times opened restaurants, gyms, theatres, casinos on. we‚Äôre sitting average Ontario 1000/day (with 4% positivity rate) they‚Äôre easing restrictions testing less early on. 

So possible certain leaders sent wrong messages, including Tam, flatten curve. everyone assumes they‚Äôll get point live like normal. best opportunity get rid thing gone. low message should‚Äôve changed reduce interaction tiny bit longer we‚Äôll relatively normal small restrictions new positives pop (Like NZ) Doug Ford instance told us ‚Äúcongratulations‚Äù announced he‚Äôs opening everything up. Don‚Äôt downvote this. important information, factually accurate. may like needs said really asymptomatic spread isn‚Äôt thing know already it‚Äôs immune Covid antibodies? OK, fucking learned anything covid19?

Perimeter entire section Denmark exposed let wait out.

Not fucking complicated. add onto comment, several mutations before, however inside virus. makes problematic fact mutation outside. outside systems much harder recognizing virus look different. Therefore vaccine lot harder develop.

Beware, brutally simplified Ok scratched vinyl.... anyone would care add on... 2% those, 14% sequence look mutations. bumb % Oh great well dealing second waves already mutating strains get another mutated strain minks. Covid never going end Factory farming continuing kill millions animals thousands humans can't deduce translations, I'm inclined learn Danish right now.

Sure knowledge:

- Antibodies (From strain? likely, could also designer stuff) neutralizing less effectively - extend unknown
- spreads Denmark, 5% region, IDK absolute numbers it? dont come every single day. is, know means.... Weasels grow butcher fr fur make coats. Imagine got shit together treated animals better, situation likely. One reason go vegetarian/vegan. [Trump:] ""Well downplay it, actually, many ways, up-played terms action, action strong.""

'Quarantine centers', refer medical facilities meant take care sick &amp; elderly, mean - enough. fact exist Bill Gates' masterplan kill us somehow benefits less people spending money.

What 'travel passes'? quick google gets ""A free travel pass privilege certain class passengers use public transport service without paying fare presenting ticket. "". Nothing wrong it.

Almost mandatory vaccines mandatory vaccines pretty sure mandatory, nobody knock front door vaccinate you. Plus, good thing. devil.

Also easy crazy still get something right - broken clock right twice day, right? *For ages, Nature sent signals humans animal husbandry pastoralism acceptable.* don‚Äôt think pangolin identified intermediate host. ""El Paso setting FOURTH mobile morgue"" - article, emphasis mine. 

Thanks Morons! Someone contact Seuss Family permission make future Grinch products orange instead green... happy mink, even though sounds weird. They're living terrible life, suffer getting put down. Dane, ashamed mink industry biggest world, also glad industry gets shattered now. Always /scared Swede Seems like already detected 12 humans new virus could dozens undetected saw well worked normal Corona virus : ( ""Just little prick"" Congrats Ireland. Stay strong. waiting mutated strain show up/evolve.

Great. Fingers crossed misstranslation said ‚Äúit‚Äôs dealing antibodies well‚Äù doubt 2020 would nice us seems likely testing significant part explaining Denmark appear stopped increase new cases Sweden seeing exponential rise. stringency measures DK Se similar moment. 

Another reason could Denmark taking action earlier communicating clearly. Amazing SARS didn‚Äôt asymptomatic infection. that‚Äôs main reason can‚Äôt control virus like SARS contained. Also think people sicker died faster SARS. Actually fair point mink fur export 0.7 percent entire gdp last year historic low. Less 2% todays test positive. Doctor? Really? whole story virus mutated bat, pangolins humans? one bat eye thing humans minks back humans? like one cares scientific details anyone. 

Like every time virus goes human animal, fast HUGE sign concerns so-called novel virus. know interact species, much less backtracks us, again. could way deadlier harder treat. Like article clearly points out. Remember Covid infected 4-6 species already. uncanny virus fast something happens easy nature. version basically immune anti-bodies, making vaccinations irrelevant? 

No. immune anti-bodies COVID-19 making vaccination made COVID-19 irrelevant *this* mutation. Elective surgery Nov Dec (Covid Fear)

I scheduled elective surgery Nov Dec Philadelphia (complex colon procedure) Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)

Share study, fear mongerer.  test mice too? (Since mink eat mice, think) live Denmark honestly I'm glad they're terminating farming 17 MILLION mink, support man. Also farmers suppliers farms fully financially compensated government factory farming serious concern, especially considering easily bird swine diseases seem make jump. bad mink farming practices we're giving contracting virus animals? easily avoidable... Yeah, fuck coronavirus lol. already winning don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs blaming accusing China covid it‚Äôs effect. saying comment referring fact China hides news country able use influence power possibly shut news coming WHO. COVID-20 beta patch buggy. seems new, much said yet, qualified guess would new one. far dk sequence 14% positive covid test received. number 
This higher countries line, government use propaganda lmao.  Besides jumped early, seems learned lesson viruses evolve extreme way animals. virus humans evolves way best helps survive humans. evolve way harmful humans unless two things happened similar. 

While virus circulating human population developing traits help spread among humans developing traits help spread species. coincidentally able spread another species encounters completely different environment. environment evolve survive spread effectively may mean changing things fundamentally useful virus humans. Usually means less infectious humans.

The problem time virus jumps species showing completely new bag tricks. new tricks useless, occasionaly one extremely useful sort thing would naturally evolved population.

In case parts virus targeting vaccines parts virus stable. stable effective helping virus survive spread humans. Turns super effective infecting minks, virus mutated parts important anymore different version better effect minks survived spread. virus jumped back humans new, possibly less effective tools.

The trouble old tools targeting vaccine. strain virus able survive spread, even less infectious current version living with, problem vaccines working help.

And, actually know whether less infectious, less deadly. think prefer find out.

 think real nightmare scenario virus becomes specialized jumping species.  Maybe live pasta month locked down, maybe get every man woman child vaccinated. sure hell can't vaccinate every squirrel cat cow mink bat.  Animals even less likely political parties agree wear masks social distance. intubated point? someone's intubated, tube rub push vocal cords. prolonged intubation, become bowed outwards and/or develop nodules rubbing, affect vocal quality. OK, judging contain it:

It 5% infections region, dance around guidelines like 10 people meeting.

So show reduced sensitivity antibodies.

vs.

the robustness customized antigens vaccines. wait til starts spreading mutating vital industry farms, like cattle hens. Might want get used idea vegan. thing happening Netherlands. Covid20 come. Yet reasons us humans need get shit together treat animals. humans. turned coats keep sick, isolated, mink nice warm. makes sad. got watching Rand ass youtube channel called Mink Man super dope, minks. monks infect humans animals don‚Äôt?  farm minks. decision overall good animal welfare, devastating mink fur industry. What‚Äôs second don‚Äôt know‚Äôs third ... something.... mink farm workers work multiple farms? Could different humans transmitting different minks? seagulls carry this? feathers?  like South Park special  Danes use -son suffix, use -sen. seems like inherent animal abuse many animals start killing know (temporarily) sick. realize shit happens basically... Well, everywhere? There's still evidence ADE SARS-CoV-2 here, usually first reaction someone assumes Switzerland run efficiently.

Switzerland could literally fire national state council would discuss colour theoretical firehoses month even *talking* dealing fire (let alone actually it). wait more!! COVID-21? say never. expected widespread infections, vaccine-resistant mutants appear take propagate pandemic. worse scenarios mention brevity. guess covid going problem around 2030, going covid multiple times then.

I'm trying accept come terms parents going pass away lose significant portion health. life guess, stuff happens. I'm aware agreement. I'm glad hear left wild hope able stay disease free. It‚Äôs almost like stop mass-fucking-over animals ffs. ethical, responsible adults

Be prepared receive response tired good old ""don't tell do"" ""but taste tho"". relevant brings attention fact vaccine isn‚Äôt cure pretending be. Realism isn‚Äôt fear mongering coward Maybe, maybe, quit using animals stupid stuff like making fur coats them, viruses mutations would prolific. question well. fact spread humans obviously good, exactly looking here? On? implying seagull mechanical vector? lockdowns work either. _you_ really want? Well least folks /r/Coronavirus equally racist violent towards people guess.

On /r/Worldnews like though. supposedly affect birds, birds landed farms, got shit feet, flew another farm virus transfered way. seagulls got sick, particles birds transfered mink Ok Biden won, sub disbanded now. Nice effort US good response Germany, 44 thousand vs 240 thousand would dead now.

And country bordered nations much worse situations, like Belgium, France, Netherlands. think pretty great. Fuck poor minks positive note, wild fur sell better prices now. time. time paying idiocy well. Eventually luck runs stupid. Oh gay community 80s. still use fur though, right??

Nice post! depends outlook. Risk personal standpoint something completely different point view disease control. Sounds like even freak accident would catch virus would pass on. üòä mutation spike know notation yet. tested laboratory neutralizing antibodies seem affect it. yeah, Covid-20. really hope dead ends humans. COVID spike really efficient binding human ACE2. It‚Äôs fairly common Coronaviruses infect humans (happens cow farms lot), chaining going human-human nowhere near common, hopefully spike mutation makes less likely spread around humans. Hahahah, Denmark country eu always uses highest level dangerous substances/poisons possibly allowed farming industry, allow sick consume animals eu get critical comments European commission torture, eu. Danish mink breeders *outraged* ordered wear masks working sick mink. honestly always said would surprised got live old age *without* danish farmers causing dangerous epidemic caused real attention. 

You probably heard happy people earth eh? forget ""ignorance bliss"".

The study followed group COVID patients contracted disease seven months previously. (Obviously longer, paper prepared September that's oldest data available.)

Of group, 90% antibodies. (Or precise, according paper itself, days 40 199, 90% subjects found carry antibodies.)

As guys learning something us, *really* fucking simple. Make illegal leave home without mask. Ensure proper social distancing. Constantly remind everyone public messaging, text messages, posters signs, commercials, etc maintain proper hand hygiene, wear masks properly, etc. functional government knows contact trace, forces people quarantine, forces people coming country quarantine two weeks.

This stuff simple. easy. works. We're basically living normal lives here, big gatherings get vaccine. economy, due us keeping virus control, currently path grown compared end 2019... compared almost rest world whose economies retracted. sad minks cake.

Oh man, that'd shame waste much cake. Yeah real fear. human hit, better nature. absolutely evidence virus spread via seagulls. It‚Äôs based fact found virus feet bird flown area farm.

WooHoo !

Let's kick COVID-19 ! Well, do. Good thing policy humans negligent taking aspirin blood thinner. It‚Äôs negligent send home emergency room follow up.

May look Doctorate degree ? seem like panicking fr man lol

And clear calling someone benches 1.5x bw weak stupid

/u/blazingsaint guy man lol Theres word that. Endemicity.

Maybe everything 2020 horrible sign universe work nature instead it...mankind good ignoring self-reflection even 2020 forcing us. Da fun? There‚Äôs 17 million mink Denmark? since wanna play gotcha, probably read jews denmark WW2, link you. concern seagulls could spread new virus quickly, animals people. would like agree people gross but... people easily touch surfaces ultimately mouths etc. Well... killed all, huge number actually startled me. 

I knew mink fur industry, never assumed huge numbers. yes, find hugely disturbing. No, think triggered worse (previously undiagnosed) [postural orthostatic sure sounds like others also experienced (randomly racing heart, gasping air, etc.). Functionally, it‚Äôs like altitude sick sea level sitting standing.

Everyone's death counts seem low me. 

\-\_- that's bad though. Google translate - ‚ÄúAll mink must killed‚Äù made day 17 million minks?  that's obscene.  

hopefully die quickly. We'll see, business shutdown due culling year two, may well politically viable ban it.  know virus came sarscov2. know need sequence need publish sequence. know could new virus that's seasonal. let's wait make assumptions. mean, possibly? knows, really. prove covid present seagulls' feet - got transferred anyones guess, I'd imagine us go around licking stuff seagulls walked without disinfecting general.  Yeah exactly saying panic vaccine effectiveness deployed kill minks? help lockdown efforts?

I‚Äôm getting Emu War flashbacks would kill 13 million minks? imagine won‚Äôt hazmat suites gas masks flamethrowers guns. Sars-CoV-2.1 don‚Äôt know mink (like me), don‚Äôt google them. They‚Äôre cute it‚Äôll bum out. kept reading milk, thinking going kill lot cows. I've never seen word ""mink"" before, lol. fair something we've looking get rid long time. Norway couple years back. Problem lot people get royally fucked pulling rug farms thus main source income. least Corona helped steer us right direction, government help farmers economically. think restart mink production this.  makes comfortable, assume time someone says ""Coronavirus"" referring group viruses.

Pedantic sod. true, massacre pointless. definitely mutate here.

We really never going get lives back we? üòîüòî It‚Äôs negligent warn feeling better doesn‚Äôt mean end illness necessarily. It‚Äôs negligent taking aspirin blood thinner. It‚Äôs negligent send home emergency room follow up.

Who knows did? It‚Äôs quite clear didn‚Äôt need die.

Anyone familiar basics disease know facts. Everyone reads articles read it. 

Just doctors nurses died, doesn‚Äôt mean aren‚Äôt negligent treatment young girl.

 Edit add: call patient dies could saved proper care? Nature laughs last would update trebuchets  incredibly fucked up. Reminds pig farms US suffocating pigs earlier year holding longer profitable.

So much suffering reason beyond ""because tastes good lol"" ""fur soft (: can't wait buy another :)"". cruel.

Even empathize suffering organisms, point need come terms fact major pandemics/health concerns recent history stemmed demand meat consumption. Bird flu, swine flu, covid-19, mad cow.

We need rein stop completely senseless risk. There's good reason it. That's basically stating.  Thanks.

Thank contagion end montage üôå First wave got dealt swiftly disease basically gone summer without mask-mandate. people felt roll protections back put vice government get economy rolling. summer people got home vacation back work suddenly back masks, heavy distancing max gathering ten people. variant coronavirus endemic mink mutated contagious humans? got kidding me. stop mink trade together hmm? stop putting animals dirty, inhumane buildings cages let free. deserve selfish treating nature cruelly Different, lottery. Flu usually fatal less contagious got animals (because less suited infect human upper respiratory system) Rona...we know yet. *Scooby liked this.* like wot Adolf Hitler - gas 'em Cause test thousands dogs daily.

If think 2 dogs this. fooling yourself. think we(the danes) obligated close borders mutation control. *marks ""new strain Covid-19 factory farming""off 2020 bingo card*

Only 2 months, folks. still couple squares I'm hoping stay blank like, kidding now, always thought danes ones advanced people planet. interesting breed animals skin make fur coats. Fur unnecessary. 0.7 percent Danish export generated fur. yes

we'll chopping sending eaten china

seeing start corona virus 2021 fully believe proof. China selling. one case HK one UK. testing less decrease cases. another lockdown Valid point. started wondering moment posted comment. BORDER STILL OPEN???? LOL idea everyone chooses get pregnant kids. got pregnant last child pill! want abortion I'm happy stable relationship happy her. (She's almost 3) certainly plan timing.  Many people don't. Get real. happening Netherlands, Sweden, Wisconsin probably places already. virus mutated dozen times already, remember whole fear mongering shit deadlier strain COVID-19 back March? specifically L-type S-type. virus continue mutate, necessarily mean become deadlier. fact chances become less deadly. also infectious presymptomatic phase. Dogs. Wuhan minks\*  crazy fast. I'm happy process seemingly going without much disruption surprise. getting logistics place start creating large scale immunity.

Until then, gonna long winter... I‚Äôm danish. think close borders travel Denmark control. serious. well, except Dennark one control.. It‚Äôs likely places see similar mutations Lick hairy taint son ""This bird shits you... gives mutated coronavirus."" 2020, Stop it. please. Save surprises later years happens densely populated. cat get it. cat infect... generation / adaptation cats.

If pack million confined area... get new improvement virus new mutations acquired population. That's get swine flu example. Proximity density. forge new virus diversity (both species origin) better. Hence wet market fingers pointing original Covid viruses. discovered infected mink time ago Denmark killed mink area also tested workers infections. turned seagulls flying around infecting mink-farms version SARS-COV-2 found mink infected workers version respond antibodies made protect covid-19. therefore dealing new strain thus new potential pandemic top existing one. things pretty bad. know, I'm biologist infectious disease researcher, I've read articles stating found sewer systems (and dating virus back way earlier first thought many countries). We'll find science can't hide anymore, animals fact infect humans.

But wanna cull cats dogs, virus going away, ever. shhh, don‚Äôt ask questions big mink come"
