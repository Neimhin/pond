Using spread factor pretty easy ways determine herd immunity needed. Even spread factor isn‚Äôt exactly correct, idea wait around know sure bonkers. Every minute variants able spread chance mutation.

Of course dirty mask grow bacteria. question whether bacteria harmful. Bacteria living skin cause respiratory infections. like, said, place dirty mask onto table infectious bacteria could catch something. would happen course day's wear, weeks wear end. 

Keep mind 90-95% upper respiratory infections (""colds"") viral nature. Viruses replicate without host cells would grow mask.

Find article shows link increased mask wearing without washing leading noticeable increase respiratory infections talk. Otherwise making massive leap based limited evidence supporting data. borough arbitrary political boundary. No, bullshit. general population wasn‚Äôt prone believing stupid shit grasp basic science, garbage would never found foothold did. wasn‚Äôt Wakefield, would scammer effect. Wakefield first one give people wanted. said symptoms felt exactly times, second testing positive. hospitalized time. 

Maybe coworker around time, November 2019 double ammonia put ventilator. lived hospital bring experts idea causing issues. Two months later covid hut news serious. I've also read reports already US around november/December. Maybe wasn‚Äôt great idea US away restrictions 200 million people still vaccinated. Hell even still 150 million vaccinated. could go wrong! keep getting feeling spiked ball 5 yard line serious side effects emerged vaccine longer effective variants maybe FDA wouldn‚Äôt grant approval. plenty vaccines there. 

Suggestion contrary purely hypothetical conspiracy stuff. *Clickbait!* article says TWO children This, older people likely vaccinated

We‚Äôre pretty clearly big rise cases, I‚Äôm hopeful deaths least much lower previous peaks Holy shit, ARRESTED! people fuck around. issue they‚Äôre making conclusion based assumption asymmetric spread. 

I mean you‚Äôre vaccinated sick would get test. It‚Äôs analysis trends wouldn‚Äôt make sense otherwise. study yet I‚Äôve seen quoted anywhere. stuff like Aussies figuring vaccination site spreader event. way happens someone asymmetric. vaccinated, must breakthrough. 

That‚Äôs read reporting anyway. worry stats get worse. two kids, 5 7, frustrated last months US ‚Äúreopens‚Äù mask mandates drop off, kids can‚Äôt vaccinated. weren‚Äôt really taking places before, it‚Äôs really hard now. Especially knowing everyone without mask actually vaccinated. 

Anyway, brings to, many fine that, including parents run similar aged kids, strong belief share kids aren‚Äôt impacted. kids certainly far less likely, rough outcomes. done much past year half keep safe it, throwing finish line something come around to.

So worry kids vaccinated soon it‚Äôs possible, percentage vaccinated actually drop even vaccinated parents don‚Äôt see urgency getting young kids vaccinated. giant population added pool used stat, population possibly worst rate. see preview looking 12-18 age group already. Death potential bad outcome COVID infection.

Keep mind, too, that's 331 deaths time NPIs dropped pediatric flu deaths 1. 

Typically, many times that.

We've quit NPIs. LMAO

‚ÄúYou call coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, call America.‚Äù I'm saying, point both. RSV ripping right now. kid twice past 3 months. Got wife pretty sick well. Same! Sure, public health community, individuals. vaccinated person 10% chance contracting exposed, chain infections die 1 2 hops (it‚Äôs probability: 0.1 * 0.1 = 1/100, forth). 10% actually 90%, get community spread really easily. 

Another way think it: sure, getting vaccinated reduces odds catch exposed 10x. But, everyone vaccinated means odds exposed first place go far more. risk product two, benefit much community‚Äôs vaccination own. Thus, ‚Äúselfish.‚Äù  dont tell me? chosen elderly, obese, immunocompromised person ad. Well, guess could immunocompromised.  caught Bin Laden via immunization campaign, Talban reasons think vaccines = espionage. COVID-19 vaccines vaccines.

Covid-19 vaccines lowers horrors virus body. Yet spectators Olympics... Easing restrictions caution course impact Rt. Rt remains safely 1, really matter. High-vax regions definitely reached herd immunity even Alpha strain. 

Besides, ""everyone"" going restaurants many places months. would sudden synchronized rise cases select places cautious people finally returning restaurants? 

You literally identify inflection point state based Delta becomes majority cases. states gotten lucky far week two behind others terms Delta prevalence. catch too. example, Georgia still ""well"" despite low vaccination rate. laggard Delta cases: last week, 20% cases Delta (it's 90%+ many hotspots). change next 1-2 weeks Delta rapidly becomes major variant much stronger uptick aligned low-vax states like Arkansas. they‚Äôre completely fine?

In world? seeing higher hospitalization rates.

UK 25% way previous *peak*. Bullshit.

Andrew Wakefield published Lancet, flagship UK medical journal, work set years research vaccines autism. Millions dollars poured finding connection people vague doubts vaccines given ammunition vaccination. 

What Andrew Wakefield something still dealing with. Reddit loves blame Jenny McCartney, real person blame Andrew Wakefield. entirety pandemic 331 COVID deaths people 17 under, ages 1-4 looks like less 20.

I want minimize it, young people kind risk profile flu, part make life-altering decisions order avoid.  I.e. oxygen cannula really donate long production stopped. Zip code, IIRC.  Yes would. hope FDA honest worry reputation.  Well maybe J&amp;J üòÖ short staffed everywhere it‚Äôs slim pickins. I'm worried kids returning school states governors banned mask mandates schools.  Get it. pattern last year repeating, except graph shifted down. Almost everyone ID issued state. federal government version aside passport. FDA pushing Government approve vaccines, waving around scientific data support it. Manufacturers Government pushing FDA!

You seem confused FDA is. FDA part government. Companies apply approval, lengthy review process often slowed considerably simply bureaucracy. Tennessee Department UN-Health don‚Äôt understand people judgmental don‚Äôt want take it. FDA hesitant approve even bad track record, shouldn‚Äôt hesitant take it? elaborate? I‚Äôm California 50% people see still wearing masks. 70% vaccination rate believe. mean 500k deaths right Anyone else coming colds often since mask mandates dropped? think like third cold two months. Plus started working doctor's office since I'm sure helping. you‚Äôre saying random testing performed high school baseball team doesn‚Äôt tell us hospitalization rate among nursing home residents? That‚Äôs incredibly insightful, greatly appreciate valuable input.

No fucking shit Sherlock. Jesus Christ. ~3% overall estimate comes analyzing different age groups. one extrapolating results high schoolers across entire population. Shouldn‚Äôt obvious 3% figure? ~50 million COVID cases 40 population less 100,000 hospitalizations. 3% would imply 1.5 million hospitalizations. Covid Popsicles. Happy cake day!

I mean, Florida graphs aren‚Äôt loading mobile, get tl;dr? also counted people got tested hospital, skews towards severe cases people mild case going hospital tested. User name checks out, that's happens spew shit XD I'll judge personal decisions you. Fucking asshats. finding this? barely ever see covid related headlines anymore. agree. FDA would ignore virtually body count point. F .......The Tennessee Department Health Well folks mid-70s. vaxxed sometime March, *immediately* started running around mask. brother old lady baby boy COVID. folks maybe saw twice.  brother told second got vaxxed place, masks, trying coddle baby. 

Idk, like vaccine mental hangup masks end....but according CDC, still recommend vaxxed.  Like knows Many already dead Delta Variant Give 'em hell. :) Towing line never disgusting Haha yeah media see close opposite sentiments. I'm really torn reading sides argument this, ultimately see different restriction employer may place worker specific job role (provided employee following rules specified anyway).

You would need pass extreme physical mental fitness tests join military branches, would expected follow strict hygiene standards working food processing preparation... even minimum wage line chefs can't fake nails wear make kitchens.

So surely would expect people whose job provide primary care vulnerable high risk part population ensure effectively possible?

I see argument carers 'forced' vaccinations... mind... thing. want receive vaccination free find place work require one.

To clarify stance 'body autonomy'... worked hospitality 10 years numerous tattoos piercings. deemed company advanced climbing management ladder look unprofessional, part contract agreed always wear long sleeve shirts remove piercings every shift. never issue upper management regional. made choices body also consequences so, believe lot people arguing unfair simply understand world need accept everything without question. kids daycare March 2020 pulled started happening. things started getting bad, husband found way switch shifts work weekends one weekday work M-F even though collectively work 7 days week, one us always home kids (we fully vaccinated babysitter overlap day. wears mask here). brutally exhausting two kids 2.5 almost 4 home, day every day, little interaction outside activities, four us safe gotten sick. actually put deposit another day care earlier year burnt out, got wet feet last minute I'm thankful crazy variant. 
 
If swing think perfectly reasonable find way keep kid safe. priority here. go back finish degree; can't go back bring child back dead. Even kid easy course, long term risks unknown. making changes they're fully vaccinated. Good luck you. put people safety well-being profits. every country much better pandemic. horrific is, children still high risk. exceptions don‚Äôt change that.

It doesn‚Äôt make less horrible, especially people able vaccinated kids likely wouldn‚Äôt infected first place. 

I‚Äôm taking precautions possible, unless something changes more, kids low risk getting severely ill virus. many, may worth risk make sure don‚Äôt fall far behind socially developmentally. others, depending situation, might not.

It really comes location though. many states, kids returning school shouldn‚Äôt severe issue. states low vaccination rates though, risk, especially families. also places haven‚Äôt taken precautions seriously refuse get vaccinated, I‚Äôm actually sure done change anything. know particular group's motto: screw future people, want profit NOW! easy get long term effects virus.

So, all, receiving help kids quite literally sucking wind much worst long covid ever was. upvoted? can‚Äôt say take working class tested regularly assume percentage hospitalization entire population. like garbage math conservatives due justify narrative. Teachers hospital staff ages significantly lower average age hospitalized Covid patients. figure they‚Äôre old shouldn‚Äôt count? we? I'm ready try. old man hit 6 month mark August. FWIW think danger gambling ""long covid lottery"" delta currently represented, efficacy vaccines vs OG covid *also* represented media casual discussion. 

With orginal flavor vast majority variants, vaccines shown mid 80s mid 90s levels efficacy - that's really good vaccines, loud wing ""pro-vax"" camp got heads vax meant absolute immunity COVID. start assumption, end ""therefore Delta must really bad"", think situation ""well there's always meaningful chance getting breakthrough infection - slightly worse per-case basis Delta, really issue there's gonna around"". Unfortunately true vaccine mandate describe would never hold court US. Even Republicans got board pass legislation, never would, would go court paused federal judge immediately. would strike quick order. legal precedent government force anyone get medical treatment way, lots legal precedent saying unconstitutional.

This true, however people vaccinated, less likely major problem.

Edit: heavily suggesting placebo better say long covid heads. 70-90% Protection hospitalisation death, serious symptoms.

It's 60% effective actual infection delta. Assuming we're positive, quickly take us pass PCR test again?

There's wide range here. PCR tests check presence certain fragments virus, live viral particles. clearing infection (which usually takes 1-2 weeks), still test positive several weeks. cases, get negatives almost immediately infection ended, also cases people testing positive 6 weeks symptoms ended.

Maybe we‚Äôll see vaccinations go up. Thanks fighting good fight never win sub. clearly think every child constantly masks even though literally less deadly flu them.   Smug windbag. One thing confuses people different statistics vaccine effectiveness often used without clarifying one (the number cited parentheses):

1. Protection infection (70-75%)
2. Protection symptomatic illness severity (85%)
3. Protect severe illness hospitalization (93%) [mentioned user]

The second one number that's referenced since vaccines came out. people freak hear first statistic, without understanding distinction different measures. can't deny coverage pre-existing conditions. increase premium risky lifestyle choices. ive posted elsewhere recently covid late december/early january. lost taste smell among things. got double shot pfizer march/april. taste/smell havent improved whole bunch. thinking cases increase US along fear-mongering, vaccination rates climb back up. seems happened. Looks like really hit wall point covering people make bad decisions. 

How people get injured driving influence? sober going 5 miles speed limit got injured? obese? smoke? 

This really bad road go down.   No, seeing sensational headline (regardless tragic is) deciding factor decisions. Actually real research deadly children decide school social distancing. Never trust media something like that.

By way, 2 children, 10, thankfully.   happened daily area yeah

That‚Äôs nice nuanced opinion. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll convince lot people type argumentation :)

I‚Äôve taken vaccines, kids. I‚Äôm taking one though there‚Äôs data it, it‚Äôs even relevant point. Unfortunately could see even well-vaccinated states, like NJ, NY, CA, reimplement draconian restrictions mostly politically-motivated reasons. goes without saying child suffering tragic. 20% original number significant.  waiting for? couldn‚Äôt easier get vaccine. doctor Missouri said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre either going get covid get vaccine. much better outcome vaccine.‚Äù know vaccinated people get delta too, rarely die. Let's set failure. care ""feels"" like them. evidence support feeling. Covid vaccine extremely safe effective.

People oppose Covid vaccine anti-vaxxers. Full stop.   I‚Äôve learned last year people he‚Äôd protecting, well ones protected staying home school last year, aren‚Äôt grateful would never return favor. dont care governor says. Sadly think total mistake headline changed 2 children life support. can't help think correction fuel attitude, though. Vaccines prevent infections, close 100% time. gymnast responded already. think vaccinations elderly delta virus changing numbers. table doesn‚Äôt reflect we‚Äôve seen world unvaccinated people infected delta. North Florida How're taste smell senses now? that‚Äôs good option :) Headline updated children life support Mississippi sees surge delta variant cases Right, that's get doofy headlines like ""More Contagious Variant Spreading Faster."" sister station KGO-TV reports, **of nine COVID patients Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital past week, two vaccinated. 13 COVID patients Marin County hospitals, two also fully vaccinated.** ‚ÄúMany adolescents could become hospitalized, Hotez said, adding 30% children infected develop long-haul covid.

""What condemning whole generation adolescents neurologic injury totally unnecessarily,"" Hotez said.

For me, better help protect parents grandparents would really bummed lack action caused harm selfish.  far know vaccines potential cause immediate reactions usually within first two weeks. think data support long-term delayed side effects vaccines.

Your body produces mRNA order make proteins antibodies are. naturally happens body infected anything. body reads it, makes mRNA, sends factory produce antibodies.

Old vaccines worked giving body something read, covid vaccine essentially skips step directly gives information antibody produce.

First time read thought I'd see radio silence. I'm sorry bringing politics would expect Trumps America needs addressed asap. Conservatives always hated one. Florida, ""infinite wisdom"" decided electing pro-death, pro-covid governor good idea. would tomorrow. can't waste bandwidth caring them. Obviously going agree this. 

You said know details meeting, yet feel sufficiently informed come Reddit criticize CDC/govt. That's interesting approach uninformed outsider. 

You seem think maybe Pfizer dealt generalities provide sufficient evidence booster need meeting CDC asked share data conclusions. 

But hey, go ahead criticize CDC based meeting admittedly know anything about. kinda funny tho say congress can't make law requiring vaccines? ruling mention that. Provide source. Oh let get treatment. Let go life changing debt. Perhaps tip scales health care industry. Plus kids 12 correct statement. expect politicians act mature, responsible, dignified. none those. vaccinated? First all, want thank daily thread getting winter wave, nice find hub rationality away rest sub media. 

I currently live big US city lot restrictions last year 90-95% normal tried best explore new neighborhoods go meet new people. (I've fully vaxxed since April 26th)

That said, despite many thread correct predictions (outbreaks rural areas low-vaccine uptake) thread seems way pessimistic back winter America 250k cases 4000 deaths day, Europe shut down, variants entered pandemic discourse.

I mean based I'm seeing day-to-day IRL, things city way better 2-3 months ago, actually feels like real city enjoy everything makes great. Yet come Twitter, I'm getting increasing summer 2020 vibes feeling ""impending doom"" even rational voices like Dr. Gottlieb. 

I know believe anymore  see headline. Ahhh, that's great info, thanks. we're talking people overweight asthma, we're talking **clinically immunocompromised** people. mean we're going ""something read article morning"" that's reassuring context.

And yes, 100% correct. horrific. conversations I've even left-leaning people last year changed way see people forever. ""I want wear mask"" ""I want stay house"" important ""Somebody might die."" anti-vaccination hysteria gone roof right-wingers cases skyrocketing idiots pay price. Fuck data everyone keeps posting _isn't actually study_. Wanna see study?

Cuomo impeached behavior? lmfao I‚Äôve lived places wasn‚Äôt fluent primary language, try arrogant ignorant assume struggling English makes one stupid worthy ridicule. also don‚Äôt go stalking people‚Äôs comments reg fuck would waste time. Sorry, guess? LOL efficacy (reduction death vaccinated vs unvaccinated), probably die could get ICU refuse go there. Ah shit Neither pal. Alabama. really good idea? Think it. Personally, going door door would safety issue would rather take.  Definitely that, too. Months ago, remember said many posted articles considering September approval (my pediatrician also recently agreed timeline). Delta variant started dominating, it‚Äôs possible sense urgency upped. haven‚Äôt seen much info circulating recently vaccine‚Äôs approval children. three young children eligible vaccines, though, would think he'd using care prevent bringing something back home them. Indian variant much milder 2020 like read part comment liked, ignored part like. Specifically part compared summer summer. 

But want move goalposts cherry-pick one avenue, let's another avenue. we're comparing July July, we're almost exactly amount testing July 2021 July 2020. surprise surprise, number cases still way compared then.

I'll reiterate: *Stop panicking fearmongering.* jump gun internet, can't take shit back 80% number coming people went ICU? many people go ICU? wouldve expected numbers reversed. Ah shoot saw 32k 7/11 got excited üò© Sounds good don‚Äôt bring negative energy state bodies best defenses given right toolsüëåüèΩ ""nbclocal"" enough marker saying ""This light detail analysis."" NY. TfL staff seem onboard it. Makes absolute sense costs nothing. They‚Äôre still 350 deaths day somehow think they‚Äôre well. USA records deaths three days Australia seen TOTAL. Actually it‚Äôs better constituents still go work live freely choose deaths 10-30 per day you‚Äôll fine. Well interesting thing excellent data current IFR region Delta predominant, 52% population fully vaccinated. 

The current IFR UK people aren‚Äôt aware although Japanese public disapprove games.. Japan contractually bound IOC proceed games unless [the IOC decides postpone fair there‚Äôs fair bit PR - games meant showcase Japan‚Äôs progress option ‚Äúcancellation followed success Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics (which almost certainly go ahead)‚Äù.. _feels_ bad

I‚Äôm sure current mismanaged clusterfuck much _showcase_ Quick vaccine facts

* Everybody 16+ well 12+ comorbities offered vaccine
* Recently last Sweden's 21 regions opened vaccinations 18+, meaning adults get vaccinated
* Vaccinations opened 16+ mid August
* 70% adults received least one dose, 45% received doses.
* Age distribution additional statistics found (in Swedish)
* vaccines currently used Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna. 
* limiting factor still supply, although likely change maybe two months. shared damn article good news somehow I‚Äôm getting downvoted. sub contradicting place sometimes. nuts?? UK recorded 42,000 virus cases today! That's highest total 6 months--and equals 200,000 US cases read 2 doses Pfizer reduce chance infection 80%. AZ lower, think around 70%. Still notable proportion people dose. people whatever want now. explains 30k cases. think mainly unvaccinated people worry, might get Covid chances getting serious illness long term effects massively reduced.  CDC studied quality breakthrough infections overall fewer symptoms, *half* time spent sick, test negative earlier, 40 percent less chance febrile, etc. Mild symptomatic breakthrough infections largely don‚Äôt look like mild symptomatic naive infections. dont wanna florida man one variant different children. one. thought here. know vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective preventing infection. Slow news day guess.  Agreed. must applied public transport well. Maybe wear mask crowded spaces safe.  measure came wake discovery **one asymptomatic case**.

That's proactive rather reactive. think UK peak? Looks like growth slowed down. feel kinda bad saying this, fuck it. 

Vaccines safe effective. people getting vaccinated (by choice) kind people support dangerous destructive politicians. 

So want remove voting pool voluntarily, say let them. 

It sucks there's collateral damage ignorant selfish attitude, that's shit goes life human history. always occasions matter century look at. sure meeting talking about.

As best tell, under-12's agenda CDC ACIP's June meeting - originally scheduled 6/18, postponed 6/23 6/18 declared federal holiday short notice.

The COVID part agenda discussed myocarditis benefit-risk balance vaccination ""adolescents young adults"" would looking proposals around current agenda July meeting covers Guillain-Barre syndrome boosters immunocompromised.

Agendas linked ""meeting materials"" tab presentations Yeah, anyone link recent info this? 8-year-old asthmatic, important me.  also overpresents people hospitalized. isn‚Äôt helpful telling us actual rate long covid. Pfizer tested positive day. many friends mine. live NYC  really starting feel like second 

If loved ones vaccinated, effectively **for you**. Go live life extent comfortable &amp; safe **for you**. Look outside, majority folks city headlines touting ""rise cases"" numbers still low.

We can't live like hermits hoping come rejoin society COVID fully eradicated, might ever happen.   Translation

**Now 70 percent everybody 18 years older Sweden received least one dose, 45 percent fully vaccinated two doses**

Since start 27 December 2020 14 July, 5,747,869 people Sweden received least one dose covid-19 vaccine, 3,682,574 also received second dose. means 70.2 percent everyone age 18 received dose 45 percent received second dose. shown data National Vaccination Register.

\- come long way vaccination coverage Sweden means lot reduce spread infection able keep low level, says Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist Swedish Public Health Agency.

By mid-June, 51 percent 18-year-olds older received least one dose covid-19 vaccine, quarter vaccinated two doses. **From** OKC. Judging comment history raised went school there. feel need make excuses people without looking anything own? Humans vector virus spread. I'm saying definitely reason, especially since Cape particular shady statistics past. know ton people live unfortunate experiences due drug abuse among people area, including myself, though luckily form repeated theft me. super hard get local police, however, even pursue police reports things like harassment, vandalism, theft, especially think drugs may play role.That's big reason left area. locals get burned look better tourists.

It harder hide 2020, well. Less tourism meant visibility locals.

Gotta downvote shit Wtf prefer ability move freely throughout regardless vaccination profile.

If scared wear mask I'm sick authoritarian types trying tell do. see rabbit hole? even know I'm implying naive?    Alright, makes sense, thanks.

That said, air travel still one safest things days.

Don't get wrong, take 99% odds fine fully vaccinated. sucks still full percentage.   There's gulf two Americas, right. 

But involve vaccination status, skin color gender. simply things used divide us. Bc don‚Äôt fully comprehend medical effects covid have. cases people mild illness also organ damage. Nothing known long term effects virus preliminary info doesn‚Äôt look amazing point is?

The US simply fortunate due existing status global dominating economy horses backed expense others turned best vaccines world. mRNA could easily ready prime time exteme side effect worries like blood clots could effectively make entire investment worthless. US also let millions AZ doses rot back March entire batches ruined due shitty meddling.

Oceania went heavy AZ consequently scrambling mRNA shots sudden nobody wants AZ anymore. statistic vaccinations seen Table 2 here: 45% **adult population Sweden** vaccinated 2 shots 70% total received least one shot. die straight away. Wait weeks able start counting deaths. That's exactly I'm feeling!. 
And happened months got covid. 
I get smell H2S foods like egg chicken. Wrong take this, misleading take.

I also think bodies amazing healing medicine bolster ability things quickly. example, get strep throat own. also contagious week after. anti-biotics get strep matter days longer contagious 24 hours fever break. better better community around you. sometimes get moderate mental health issues alone, combine counseling/therapy modern medicine heal faster (and plan get moderate medicines).

With normal testing way get something similar would constantly test everyone would irresponsible really materials testing needed around world. Plus people you‚Äôd want test aren‚Äôt going ones going weekly nose swab. attack rate COVID exposure breaks vaccination, easily break mask. require vaccination enter indoor public areas. People listen. People selfish. fair can't eligible yet get vaccinated. anti-vaxxers selfish. feel you. wife pregnant right I'm terrified delta country US (south Louisiana). one wearing masks more. office outbreak still one wearing mask almost one vaccinated. told I'm working home left soon found (no notify us). Animal reservoirs still concern, surely?  want immunity hard way agree bunch replies question, also think psychological PR power play (these happening last 16 months, too).

Ever pregnancy scare partner? First, afraid. start working process (whatever may be) abruptly fund false positive. almost little disappointed. ready baby still, maybe, still feeling can't quite identify. step process acceptance. 

Now, experiment, let's assume tell people mandating masks schools. outraged, etc. walk back bit, knowing spread/pandemic likely going get worse next couple weeks/months. does, go back say ""hey, got worse, need implement masks schools"". Early on, psychologically, fair number people came acceptance may happen anger diluted now.

Wasn't birth control discovered/invented someone wanted use eugenics? Interesting thanks. Looks like strong case placebo heres hoping. Sadly people know got worse it. ( mean lingering effects got worse ie; smell taste dissapeared etc). atleast protected worse. viruses also reduce likelihood serious illness, hospitalization, death. lot them, nearly dying enough convince real nowhere near enough mental health professionals actually handle number people need services.

The problem see it, treat symptoms - cannot really cure anything. 

Of course people depressed anxious, world falling apart around us daily basis work death trying get by.  Like what? crazy, indeed stressful. 

My kids day care vaccinated staff, state eased masks required unless unvaccinated honor system... already parents care follow guidelines resulting several closures. Summer lot families traveling over, fall older siblings returning school. I'm hopeful younger group able vaccinated soon. .... look anecdotal one day that? still work. Rare cases like happen, long require hospitalization lead death, a-okay.

And sometimes really, really rare cases infection vaccinated person lead worse outcomes chances lot lower vaccinated (supported determined scientific studies real world efficacy studies)

We need teach risk analysis statistics school inherent skill would really help people understand stuff like much better.

People still die car accidents despite front airbags, side airbags, seatbelts, safety glass, improved cabin structure, better crumple zones, automatic braking systems etc etc. odds much lower decades prior many mitigations place.  like flu! problem. get covid they‚Äôll become immune die.

what fucking waste. many others line organ transplants thru fault own. Hello fellow sibling. you‚Äôre vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt lives control shut people refuse take medicine Like spoiled babies yet, midst raging highly contagious pandemic virus 3-7x contagious flu, COVID associated deaths 0-17 age group line normally see seasonal  technical point, concern described actually called *nonresponse* bias, *sampling* bias. Nonresponse bias concern surveys respondents nonrespondents differ variables interest. pointed out, survey topic probably salient sample members still suffering, long haulers may overrepresented among respondents.  problem direct numerical comparisons comparing COVID rates COVID years (now &amp; 2020) flu rates pre-COVID years (&lt;2019). would rates look like 2019 environment COVID-era changes? would really want take chance find without reliable COVID vaccine cohorts still risk? Best err side precautions. many precautions big question. schools mandate masks, new HVAC systems, indoor eating, daily testing, &amp; full contact tracing everyone involved school 2 months child vaccines become available? open all? Masks, used perfectly (which always *pretty shaky,* we‚Äôre honest. many noses poking out,) reduce transmission around 20-40%, depending study you‚Äôre looking at. benefit masks super important mitigation had. 

Vaccination, meanwhile, reduces risk transmission somewhere around 80%. point, benefit mask becomes pretty marginal. 

If standing next vaccinated person naked face, unvaccinated person cloth surgical mask, assuming actually infected, (which vaccinated person less likely first place,) you‚Äôre likely catch masked unvaccinated person. 

Everything wore masks for, better accomplished vaccines. Broooooooooooooooo. cannot. fucking can‚Äôt. flu vaccine saves kids' Pre-born? You‚Äôre ok

Do even know many kids died Covid USA? (Hint it‚Äôs 300).  Sounds like Facebook mom post.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like doctor said know better.‚Äù kind black-or-white responses exhausting. like even dare suggest pandemic over, someone can't help scream LoCKdOwNs fOrEvER?!?

No. That's I'm saying. never said anything lockdowns. personal suggestion bring back indoor masking. Seeing vaccines highly effective preventing hospitalization likely effective reducing transmission, think kept indoor masking, could otherwise keep returning normal life. Going movie theater? Mask. Going store? Mask. Restaurant? Eat, mask. social distancing, lockdowns, continue base level caution. Damn. American vaccine uptake truly pathetic. AFAIK even close seeing slowdown uptake Sweden. stop 70% adults endless vaccines months. le tired Wheat think know rye talking about.

Buckwheat think rice later ""go along"" anything. try apply critical thinking situation. believe opinions rely facts either present facts, considered fantastical. best makes ""opinions"" waste time, worst dangerous misinformation. 


Vaccination programs usually considered fully efficient herd immunity achieved. that's case, make perfect sense maintain general restrictions. think there's conspiracy behind that?

Yes, there's likely level corruption public contracts distributed. quite general fact, specific pandemic. deduct there's really pandemic, engineered false reporting? 


I assume pandemic leads higher quality decisions compared we'd otherwise experience government healthcare. Mistakes must expected, surprise us. Policies may 100% consistent across different authorities situations. Nothing unusual that. Again, deduct we're hoodwinked? 


Americans get tasered police high rates every day. There's one reported case related refusing leave area masks mandatory. deduct ""people"" tasered wearing masks? lead conclusion pandemic fake?

Countries implement restrictions due time high case numbers fatalities. Countries implemented different levels lockdown restrictions managed keep numbers down. deduct pandemic fake? 


How explain 99.97% stat vs. significantly increased general mortality rates countries hit pandemic? Also, number debunked. 


Once again, random points bring lead conclusion pandemic real, ""wake up""? 


Let answer question you. don't. reason want true. make so. News gets around someone OD‚Äôd dealer‚Äôs current stash. junkies think ‚Äúoh boy, must mean dealer *good shit*‚Äùand flock buy rest.  uniquely American. happened last weekend. crazy lady tested positive booted Nassau.

We hit peak positivity 12% 6th January hit peak deaths 1200 day approx three weeks later 26th January. 

I know I'm comparing figures good vaccine progress worrying see hospitalisations, ICU numbers deaths similar trajectory last wave. J&amp;J shot already done work first mRNA shot. use spike protein antigen, presented slightly differently. tell does. anxiety, developed time, found trigger it. fixed longer it. state mind finding root problem is. born problems, certainly drug going help problem long term. think see types news stories while. enough adults get vaccinated, kids won‚Äôt risk, even can‚Äôt get vaccine. Again, never contesting prevention *always* better treatment--because acting preferable *re*act. point (and still is) bedside nurse see medication ""last resort"" ""last intervention take.""  ties directly doctors' habit giving hard ass drugs like candy.

It's mindblowing kind drugs get US, especially children. There's difference NSW Australia looking CDC monthly data ‚ÄòDrug overdose deaths‚Äô state 12 month ending, clearly see spikes start pandemic. numbers increasing years, jump Sept 2020 Sept 2019. Arizona 32% jump, Colorado 31%, Missouri 20%, Massachusetts 5.9%. spikes truly awful considering Sept 2018 Sept 2019, changes states reporting 1000 deaths nearly death toll timeframe. CDC data 2020 first 9 months processed, obvious drug overdose death huge problem Covid pandemic.  read thread earlier morning virologist discussing long covid vaccinated people. certainly nothing dispositive, helpful information nonetheless. understand people rioting France?

Vaccines administered emergency use authorization. would liable future health issues related? people died complications jab? wanna hear thoughts: exactly end game pandemic? US, vaccines available everyone ages 12 up. Delta variant causing surges, especially regions low vaccinations even regions good vaccination numbers, case count going up. Though rare, breakthrough cases happening. Even children 12 approved vaccine, breakthrough cases still happen always antivaxxers won‚Äôt take vaccine matter what. many parts world even close fully vaccinated, variants continue develop inevitably make way around globe.

So really good plan action? seems like every step take forward, get hit something else takes us three steps back. seems really difficult right try sort ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù, especially social POV. never got tho True exactly related :) Also federal government ultimately pick bill COVID related stuff? dude really fucked us future huh. ‚Äúvaccine caused autism‚Äù shit never came out. wouldn‚Äôt dealing shit extent. 80% walk independently six months 60% fully recover motor strength one year 5% 10% delayed incomplete recovery

Right. entire, ""you need masks"", ""... well actually knew enough PPE"", lie really burned ton people. I'm going go common sense now. kids vaccinated I'm playing safe then. Recent modeling puts prior infections 27%, 10%. That's kind I'm saying. antivaxxers already trying tear COVID19 vaccines apart due side-effects people having.  horrific new variant emerges...  friend 45 got covid. Lost lung far 4 heart attacks.

Thank god vaccine otherwise we'd completely fucked right now. Anyone acting vector spread virus kids, young vaccinated, asshole. 

With freedom take, take vaccine, come repercussions actions. It‚Äôs way Belgium Spain Chalkidiki huge parties clubs zero police, dont know going happen 15th new policies take place.. friend travel first place vaccinated. live NJ, close NYC. Masking still required public transit, WFH still common (although necessarily COVID). However, maybe 30% people mask even required. personally still mask grocery store, becoming less common. premiums go next year. might part immune system naturally leave behind. virus smart enough disguise evade immune system days. seems immune doesn‚Äôt clean everything remnants virus found almost every organ.

My theory immune system learns recognise bumble bee example, stinger. stingers left embedded body, leaving ‚Äúsplinters‚Äù everywhere. Whereas vaccine teaches body recognise stingers, works wasp stingers (variants).

‚ÄúIwasaki says remnants Sars-CoV-2 discovered almost every tissue brain Yes, like body full Covid-19 antibodies virus attack immune system. Probably need finish testing kids 12 first. BC residents still subjected 7-8 week wait doses?! happens want eat family? We're looking future many lower vaccination states right now. Mon Dieu! sure accurate say -80 applicable all. Unlike Covid vaccines arrives -80 preferred storage temperature.

It fantastic storage requirements relaxed allow time warmer temperatures though.

I‚Äôve looking answer question haven‚Äôt found anything concluded strongly one way other. look like road year-end, countries release evidence favour boosters yet US CDC claims otherwise? mean Americans locked boosters? Imagine lie getting vaccinated get booster. state added smokers earlier tiers rollout, plenty people claiming smokers get vaccine early. Sure good get vaccine supply low enough time enough could cut supply people really needed shots extra early? first there‚Äôs good chance already covid well protected. AstraZeneca vaccine mRNA vaccine, also near levels protection Pfizer Moderna shots even gate.

Mix together Delta variant got chance breakthrough infections.

Pfizer 95% effective major strain COVID-19 developed against. think around 88% effective Delta. Still great. Even 88% number Pfizer Delta better AZ variant developed against. They‚Äôre gonna bring fda sued. ""We want cut beaurocratic bullshit! Make government efficient.""

Half America won‚Äôt take it; that‚Äôs unfortunate reality. Maybe testing many asymptomatic cases. 

I remember December 2019 people Chinese social media saying covid fatality rate close 100%, simply assumed cases normal flu. Yes, terrible situation. ""Nobody"" wants Sinovac 600 medical personnel got infected (yeah, 670 thousand, they're highly contagious areas) even though never given general public. AZ given general public, horrible side effects effects stories passed word mouth social media, resulting vaccine hesitation unvaccinated.

Funnily enough resulted easy acceptance Sinopharm since ... stories yet. Seems communication around already full blown disaster, matter decision. Sure, guess? change context discussing another wave, people given 1 dose contribute modestly immunity (especially since protection infection must even lower 33%). 

But least people get second dose quick severity coming wave manages scare straight. True. Even eradicate COVID, still safe remove masks diseases still exist kill people. People vaccine doses protected delta variant, sense chances infection low chances hospitalization *very* low.

People single dose vaccine vulnerable covid general, especially vulnerable delta variant. understand it, UK's delta outbreak began, still lot people either unvaccinated single dose. still sizable population one dose unvaccinated.

I familiar UK's internal attitudes vaccine, whether widespread anti-vax attitudes there, whether vaccination pace quick enough get everyone protected time stop delta outbreak.

But US resident, know US well, know that, long ago, doses available vaccinate anyone wanted it. thing holding us back US people's fear vaccine. may pay ultimate price: delta variant spreads rampantly among unvaccinated people, risk new mutants infect vaccinated people well unvaccinated people increases. we'd back square one. Listen scientists -- better yet, data. 
Governments throughout pandemic demonstrated best understanding science data. 

The UK better comparable vaccination rates US. 15x amount cases earlier year. growth happened lockdown. 

What difference US UK makes confident successful? residents teens, 20s 30s, infection rate four five times residents 70s... greatly reduced risk spreading virus one fully immunized. Folks, get vaccinated Yes little risk. weren‚Äôt sure before, now. Correct, overall death rates lower almost half population vaccinated. doctor example gave almost Socrates‚Äô counterargument democracy. doctor know best patient, given choice patient deceived lying ‚Äúsweet shop owners‚Äù speak appealing lies. decision given patient, uninformed patient choose listen sweet shop owner make worse decision themselves.

Yep, could patient makes bad choice. Still can‚Äôt take away right choose, sense democracy, doesn‚Äôt literally effect body person rather foundations nation

What moronic statement. Systems government absolutely directly indirectly affect body don‚Äôt come argument ‚Äúbut think doctor intervene patients body will?‚Äù same. 

Yep, they‚Äôre it‚Äôs degrading all. average person simply isn‚Äôt qualified enough know statecraft works, hence qualified enough comment work.

Just aren‚Äôt educated constitutes functioning government doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt. Second off, even though clearly *aren‚Äôt* educated makes government function properly, still right elect leaders, it‚Äôs better make choices, think way want world be, pursue dream, learn mistakes rather lazily lick boot dictators thinking benevolent king (dictator) leading utopia old democracy itself.

I felt going die.

Treating COVID respect deserves. vaccinated, CDC recommends quarantine test. recommend skipping quarantine infected recovered last three months.

You‚Äôre going find something look enough stuff, even isn‚Äôt anything causal. interesting directions investigation, key replication study designed predeclared looking factors specifically. Move Texas. big deal sacrifice Georgia, everything lost Texas need progressives actually make move. Doesn‚Äôt everyone back this?  CDC read subreddit would known obvious everyone January 2020 virus airborne already widespread USA. Sad internet forums better advice professional health organizations.

Thanks world. fucking best. Many older nurses experienced knowledgeable units. It‚Äôs really hard argue aren‚Äôt competent. 

The reason hospitals would go firing vaccinated make new grads. it‚Äôd probably end worse patient outcomes overall.

Everyone talking side effects vaccine clear reporting bias No, already 3 approved EUA, shown effective known variants. need EUA, suppliers (like astra-zenica) filing full use authorization, since late initial filings.


Basically, new vaccine would shown effective, old vaccines way less effective another get EUA request granted. need better study Lyme tick illnesses. easy get rid of, trust me, know. general idea two weeks treat laughable. grew northeast tennessee, family remains (I longer live United States).

They **never** real lockdown kind, nobody even wearing masks anymore. wave coming them, going way slow down. Even tiny amount political enforce minor restrictions completely gone. Cases skyrocket people vulnerable (more half population) least interested protecting themselves. Holy moly that's lot cash. vaccine free.. oh wait! ridiculous. people going get vaccinated. Nothing work outside actual requirement.

You're wrong. 

My concern *fact*. help (and live with) 90-year olds. need know *need* booster, previous 2-shot January adequate. appreciate considered reply. qr code contains asn1 der idemix proof. mostly cryptograhpical data + records first letter name, first letter family name month birth. Changing records invalidates crypto proof. idemix proof proves vaccinated, tested negative went infection past disclose one applies. proves one applies. 

There's special app scanning codes. validates proof shows records personal data verified venues bouncer. records verified manually valid id card like driving license, passport id card. app works offline downloading public keys used verifying proof.

No data stored scanner app. qr code used long valid. way visit multiple venues per evening. English ia mothers language kinda hard find right words. tried make understand cautious, basically telling i'm idiot rational tought little fear history repeating itself. 

 So.. yeah. idea else say. never happy live new england people dumb getting vaccinated.

However still people ate definitely vaccination, even friends mine. sucks glad huge majority like them. Everywhere worst place world while. adults vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt matter much.  ""They're forcing could suffer serious health consequences,"" said. ""The state give damn.""

It would hilarious dramatic, patients high chance dying ever contracts Covid thinks state give damn HER. Yeah, pretty big deal people missing boosters. boosters every 6 months required reason, still nightmare individuals economic productivity whole.

The night got second dose Moderna, ass 12-24 hours so. Thankfully Friday night, way going anything productive time. even get bed, fever fatigue bad. concerning. husband beginning relax little feel like school would okay fall kids person. haven‚Äôt covid. lot time hospitals low/borderline o2 sats.

Borderline O2 room air feels floaty.

Yeah Pfizer using 100mcg, went 30mcg. That's also good hypothesis people seem less severe side effects shot versus Moderna's. Ooft vast majority new reported cases unvaccinated. vaccine isn‚Äôt going keep death rates people haven‚Äôt vaccinated. like aren‚Äôt even able give real retort. default ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt tell do!‚Äù shows real reason can‚Äôt get vaccinated.

The patients fellow workers deserve know safe be.  everyone got damn vaccine, yeah could. enough people evolve could get lives. then, golden immunity shot, shot decreases chances dying it. I'm best friend. get vaccine yet FDA approved. pretty frustrating.

My husband Moderna minimal side effects (sore arm tired also working 72 hour weeks time hard say tired directly vaccine). rest family got results, minimal side effects feel great now.

My husband's family want get shot(s). brother law doctor east coast begged rest family today get vaccine. working covid unit that's part VA since early covid. straight told family he's seeing delta variant, need get vaccine plan take care kids incapacitated vent. husband two siblings + spouses + mother + 5 kids area (we live hours away) close family could help got sick. 

Just aware - brother law works directly covid patients part response unit working since beginning pandemic said vaccinated, make end life plans plans finances/children/pets incapacitated vent. tell antivaxxers time.

Plenty people suggest kids affected. Yeah no. Keep stuff whatever want it. dont force others play rules. protection? would provide data something true? Please stop putting words mouth, thanks.

What however true one dose gives limited protection symptomatic disease 33%-ish risk reduction. severe disease, reduces hospitalization risk 75%, nice, nowhere near what's needed considering Deltas apparent increased virulence. Mostly Florida, reporting 5k+ cases day. astounding since quit testing. lifted mandatory mask mandate subway transit system US-MA. Even CDC giving green light unmask vaccinated, give fuck. Wear shit. It‚Äôs happened Reddit specific case:

A person posted article title.

The title became outdated policy changed.

The link cannot reposted correct title article cannot posted again.

First wins, correct. Yeah, 50 years ago lifetime terms medical scientific discovery. Comparing current vaccines anything farther 20 years ago ridiculous, shows people little knowledge people claiming it‚Äôs going chip them.

We know extreme ramifications covid. chance lasting issues drastically higher chance vaccines cause lasting issues. you‚Äôre getting vaccinated, concern drastically misplaced.

When leading doctors scientists say it‚Äôs good public health, is. Seriously. don‚Äôt believe politicians, believe people actually experts.

Being careful, you‚Äôre aren‚Äôt trusting science deciding own, uneducated opinion worth absolutely lunacy.  since early June we've giving 1 million shots day adults access vaccines US long enough. real question is, kids able remove masks safely? 

There guarantee Covid vaccine approval young children, guarantee Covid go completely away next years, ever.

There least community hospitalization/case metric unmasking allowed schools. Americans infantile morons demand freedom shirking responsibilities. 

There freedom without responsibility, grown children throwing tantrums demanding right piss public pool can‚Äôt comprehend impact actions others.

Americans become nation giant tantrum throwing toddlers long overdue imposition discipline. they?

Those vaccinated little risk succumbing spreading virus.

Those unwilling vaccinated probably never cared precautions first place. ‚ÄúEspecially there‚Äôs rigorous scientific evidence actually work provide significant benefit‚Äù

Dunno. unfortunately right alternative method studies I've seen look strict diagnoses patients' personal doctors  hospital visits. massive problem underdiagnosis doctors might take people seriously, compounded overrepresentation women suffer condition - they're likely taken seriously doctors first place IIRC. flu actually [linked blood No, approval two mRNA vaccines almost certainly happened end year. Vaccine side effects always show first months. Wrong, well known people test positive many weeks beating infection due 'dead' virus fragments. didn‚Äôt never

Yeesh... numbers go far small % population vaccinated? Love scope shift percentages. measure used Phase 3 trials testing positive Covid. vaccine group 8 positive cases, placebo group 162 cases. 8/162 = 5%, therefore 95% effective. trial basically participants get tested felt sick. infer people tested positive felt Covid sickness symptoms, went get tested. Actually significant percentage doubters probably get vaccinated might even enough get us herd immunity.  can‚Äôt explain words glad don‚Äôt work nurse acute care missouri. told husband moved here, years covid, would never work acute care lack safe patient ratio laws. wasn‚Äôt willing put risk either job injury risking license save employer cost properly staffing units. I‚Äôve seen insanely overworked acute care nurses last year they‚Äôre better people absolutely would. not. do. it. least Timmy died could exercise freedom dipshit positivity rate Springfield MO gotten close 30%.

I think impossible somebody situation anything like tinitus nerve damage. wish shit worst enemy  Total shit sounds better totally dead, got this! mom didn‚Äôt tell contact COVID people turned positive. kept distance needed visit mask know can‚Äôt really right thing. lucked out, day supposed dinner son - didn‚Äôt happen.  couldn‚Äôt understand mad.

Keep going, won‚Äôt forgive them, better uncomfortable months (Pfizer said Sept) hate long time

She wondered mad‚Ä¶. got unlucky since one 24,000 side graphs, cases start increasing dramatically end June. death graph goes July 3. So, spike could coming. standard, wait two weeks thing, guess? I'm Central Florida, county 50% vaccination rate. Nobody wearing mask. Anytime I've store lately, I've person mask on. alternative, besides maybe modifying existing vaccines creating new ones less side effects. Or, case immunity lasts long time reach herd immunity boosters needed, need worry all.  sick head hoping schools force vaccination young children need it, order get education. What's wrong seriously son 18 months next month. sounds like 2+ approved vaccines around Sept/Oct. give 4-5 months kids getting them. everything seems good February (I‚Äôm guessing won‚Äôt issues healthy kids) hope vax son around 2nd birthday.  weirdest thing I‚Äôve read while. would mess around vaccinations like current doses aren‚Äôt meant given three times. don‚Äôt even need third shots right now. time comes do, ready given. fair, actually ""sick"" vaccination. body produced immune responses vaccination put body. felt side effects feel like sick ""infected"".

I'm stating there's still ton misinformed people (some may reading post) refuse get vaccination reason ""don't want get sick it"".

Glad vaccinated :)   need gun stores US entire country vaccinated inside week. could argument possibly make sense you? vaccine decreases chance greatly catch covid, even do, makes symptoms milder, sickness shorter, reduces contagiousness. 100% requirement? 100% effective wash hands surgery? medicine give 100% effective? not, mean bother washing hands prescribing medicine, anything else that's 100%...? specific variation, reports people getting covid multiple times. idk mother anti vax...so cousin entire family. ""Cause diseases"" train proof except random Facebook posts ""doctors"" aka 34 year old sitting basement somewhere go absolutely urgency get kids age vaccinated  thought stroke. employer wanted everyone return work July 1st. refused, said I'd prefer stay home end year, herd immunity closer 100% possible. asked herd immunity even meant. FDA sensible requires massive amount data analysis full approval. Thank God aren‚Äôt rushing since almost none doubters would ever get vaccinated.   in-laws two hours north LA caught COVID. fully vaccinated. feel variants going blow everything us supposed to. agree. much wilful ignorance. Cognitive dissonance etc. understand fear leads people way. coping mechanism. also large portion simply care consider immediate risk. part feel safe statistically care continue propagate virus kill others. ones infuriate me!! üò° ANNNNNNND like wont going outside anymore. vaccinated....but... also tested 2x weekly covid. vaccine tested regularly fine imo ""Compulsory"" - even (before 'freedom day') compliance extremely low. I'd say 20-30% people see tube wearing masks. 

I even went get second dose vaccine yesterday, expect everyone masked up, person front coughing like crazy; mask.  r/unexpectedfuturama Medicaid--a completely taxpayer-supported, federal/state welfare benefit--stepped mandate vaccine every recipient? 

And government announced order continue receive taxpayer-subsidized insurance marketplace, vaccine required?

Money talks--and benefits line, people get vaccinated. remember within states, vaccines evenly distributed, they'll see outbreaks many parts states low vaccine uptake. Remind dad it‚Äôs Free Country, trying take away freedom wear mask seems pretty anti-American. New Article CORRECTED 2 children life support clearly inconsequential tell Parisian can‚Äôt go caf√©.

What failure communicate. Conservatives think businesses entitled reduce costs, pass costs customers, etc. 

Seatbelt motorcycle helmets got wide but-in insurers spoke up. 

My mom tried get colleague put seatbelt work trip. woman refused, even mom said she‚Äôd feel awful woman injured. 

Only mom said ‚ÄúI responsibility protect insurance company protect family lawsuit‚Äù would comply.

The new super building wouldn‚Äôt go shovel light dusting snow said wanted good neighbors didn‚Äôt want someone slip. said ‚Äúwe could sued insurance company won‚Äôt cover it‚Äù‚Äîthen went. live Tokyo don‚Äôt feel good coming weeks. Olympics may end directly causing small number infections, visitors part staying isolated, we‚Äôve entered fourth State Emergency (soft lockdown) seems [very little people‚Äôs movements.

Anecdotally, Olympics exacerbated lockdown fatigue‚Äîeverywhere events cancelled postponed, bars restaurants can‚Äôt serve alcohol, fun essentially cancelled normal people, biggest festival rich politicians benefit go right ahead. ‚ÄúWhy play rules don‚Äôt play own?‚Äù attitude, fewer fewer people see reason respect government‚Äôs requests restraint. High premiums realistic consequence. think denying coverage likely ACA? So... 6-12 year olds good place right now. *by CDC, slow folks said masks useful first. countries already it. many people? 2 percent population? leaves heck lot people vaccinated. come 2nd shot? It‚Äôs available since 2 months ago think tag line replaced ‚Äúowning kids ‚Äú Yes. May well go gold‚Ä¶ texassippi hear you, ain‚Äôt system works. Insurance companies make losses somehow. raise prices healthy people offset losses. god bless I'm glad alive vaccines helped!!!  ‚ÄúIts flu herd immunity around corner. Oh, also disappear Biden elected ‚Äú check western states since many suffering massive heat waves force people inside summer too.   that's science works. 

You medicate vaccinate people fun it. need show needed effective. give everyone daily dose aspirin anti-biotics chance catch infection get blood clot/heart attack. 

They test antibody levels time passes, well continue monitor vaccinated population regarding infections death. Remember, vaccines never 100% effective even right becoming fully vaccinated. breakthrough cases mean boosters answer. may mean vaccines work small percentage matter many dose give them. 

Sure ample supply supply really would yield greatest benefit reaching billions people around world still unvaccinated. give boosters people already protected may get benefit 3rd dose.

Also, round vaccination costs govt billions dollars. Throwing billions rounds boosters yield benefit would waste money help save lives diseases still exist disappear Covid. 

So like said, need know boosters really needed provide benefit. that's true, sure get boosters. if/when needs based solid scientific analysis. county legitimately one best counties terms vaccines state New York. 67% population least 1 dose, 61.67% population fully vaccinated, 80.4% adults least one dose.

Our positivity rate yesterday 1.9%. Two weeks ago, 0.3%. That's good thing. Like care. Sure hope 12s get vaccinated soon.  risk mitigation. tf reduce chance healthcare worker catching covid 95%?  sure vaccine, vaccine  lmao pressed. bet tiny little fists balled hard right now

WTF? opinion beyond ""other people dumb"" means pressed? God forbid someone actually know talking about. problem isn‚Äôt primarily kids missed shots 5-6 years. problem antivax movement growing strength despite common sense reality says.

The problem way complicated realize. 5-6 years Wakefield stage tremendous amount damage, actually rebounded childhood vaccine rates currently high.

Covid brought whole new set issues, still impacted Wakefield setting stage 20 years ago. complicated complicated bits matter. nuance like makes harder call people dumb easier pretend smart. emergency approval required two month follow vaccinations completed. full approval requires least six months follow data truly massive amount data analysis. mRNA vaccine companies started supplying data analysis month ago expect finish supplying data late August September. supply data ask full approval. so?

I see perfectly reasonable police might want check I'm lawful resident. 
I'd see ridiculous needlessly annoying barman needed verify ID sell beer.

Which exactly opposite seems case US. Hence, *american way* weird. I'm resident here--people, large, fastidious receiving vaccine complying mask ordinances. ""enormously selfish"" segment may need find hard way. 95% anymore delta variant. Let ‚Äòem judge. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated &amp; pry mask cold dead hands. Way many unmasked, unvaccinated, uncovered coughs/sneezes. Besides I‚Äôm sure whether long covid still risk vaccination. Cases going skyrocket coming weeks No, need deny medical financial coverage/protection anti-vaxxers (not can‚Äôt miss work work 3 jobs, true anti-vaxxers). Choices consequences, Americans entitled somewhat shielded responsibility serious consequences.  don‚Äôt currently full FDA approval? That‚Äôs looking state. Cases getting 50s, they‚Äôre 500s delta This. kids thank later. they‚Äôre older still alive. I'm stressed out. son turning 9. husband vaccinated various health issues put us higher risk serious bout COVID get it. Delta kids never really knew kids long term anyhow.

We remote schooled year. family town second half year.

It's like one cares. stay home. go library see one else always wear masks. Sometimes even outdoors.

Our school district sent letter week saying they're waiting see strictly follow guidelines next semester starts. even added links representatives basically protest restrictions.

Remote option year. 

No one seems fears. county rural Trumpy. 

I want friends again. need break. can't send back normalcy like kids ventilators dying variant never had. 

It's lot. I'm tired. know are, too. messed head get vaccinated part solution.
We need hands deck beat pandemic Definitely puts stat context doesn‚Äôt totally eliminate risk, lessens  September can‚Äôt come fast enough... unfortunately start school year. Ya honestly seems like need get Florida. WA state requiring double dose vaccinated want return fall 2021 quarter in-person classes universities. 
I've heard Florida one lenient Covid safety protocols. Probably care tourist money residents. De Santis pretty dumb man, gotta know seem highly educated. surprising me. States opening up, course cases going jump. Hopefully severe cases states close again. Give weeks would like think cases start decline steadily. americans never good fractions. God, imagine vaccine effective treatments. Would government force us social distance/wear masks forever? Social gatherings banned? Concerts, sporting events large events gone forever? Also say goodbye traveling. School virtual now. Holidays bunch people thing past. 

Not word would want live in. Reading bible makes religious. 
Understanding bible makes atheist.  Boundaries especially difficult parents. Good supporting health children, family (including parents), neighbors (like me!) getting vaccinated.  Oldest trick statistic book Yep. Swings small numbers yield bigger percentage swings.

Not that, we're talking span time preceeding following Independence Day weekend, almost every state lifted restrictions completely, time people gather together social events...*ahem* ...the perfect storm. Or, light drizzle worsening drought. can't connect dots? Reddit. refuse procedures like typical american way üá∫üá≤ cases would go again? Yeah. another wave, another, on. virus going go away. probably looking future virus similar ongoing effect society flu does. Except top flu. Might help people getting flu shot. whole world dude, US, besides J&amp;J pause back April way worse compared news.  Unfortunately it‚Äôs probably going opposite breed mistrust numbers aren‚Äôt true issue correction. totally understand lower risk cohorts wanting get vaccine yet. one it, given age, risk level, generally great results far. still basically one giant trial millions participants. grandpappy told me, lead horse water can't make drink. That‚Äôs COVID side effect, vaccine one read study last month UK 117 deaths due Delta. 117, 50 people died fully vaccinated. vaccinated age history books called Great Omega variant Culling 2021. bright side, collective IQ humanity increase. anti-Trump left-of-center relative lives LA vaccine hesitant refusing vaccine, political reasons. I‚Äôm upset scared (she‚Äôs 60), she‚Äôs stubborn. least she‚Äôs wearing mask everywhere basically isolating, she‚Äôs minimizing harm others, really REALLY wish would change mind   Yeah minor mistake, I'm BME hydrophilic able enjoy life blood stream enough brain go ""yeah, protein!"" paper say think says MIL one ‚Äúvaccinated people dying‚Äù gospel believers. Even though hundreds millions people fine. Funny enough, lives LA county too. doesn‚Äôt listen facts. deaths occur yesterday added count retroactively actually occurred several days? makes sense prioritize older people long time due vastly larger risk death, probably period would made sense vaccinate younger people along people 40s 50s simultaneously.  Oops. Thanks correcting 12 monkeys. Love Terry Gilliam, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis actually gave fuck.

 also caught last year. mildly uncomfortable 2 days parents able taste Turkey dinner. I'm glad picked carton early case quarantine weird hearing mom talk taste cigarets still wanted them. actually moment realized needed quit myself. NJ pretty good vaccinating people masks coming everywhere. Honestly think I'm gonna dust mine bit mindful, least indoors. Outside seems pretty safe CDC longer tracking asymptomatic breakthrough infections. study‚Äôs definitions were: 

- COVID-19: fever, new/increased cough, new/increased shortness breath, chills, new/increased muscle pain, new loss smell/taste, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting PLUS positive test. 

- Severe COVID-19: ‚Äúclinical signs rest indicative severe systemic illness,‚Äù respiratory failure, evidence shock, significant acute renal, hepatic, neurological dysfunction, admission ICU death.   teachers protected vaccine. Statistically negligible kid absurd way approaching life imagine.. drive car? Need go on? Total number healthy children worldwide suffering ""long term"" covid = zero, since virus around 18 months. want get kids vaccinated go it, keep hands people's kids. There's lot wrong gave, I'll focus primary, used cells result benefits. information needs reach lymphatic system lymphocytes dendritic cells primary way that's done. spike proteins produced sit around inside cell would f*ck inform immune system. 

Secondly RNA still going survive blood stream due presence RNAses hence method delivery can't simply raw mRNA else work. requires envelope fat like basically anything send blood stream protein simply hydrophilic Getting second shot provide higher degree protection future gotten COVID 19 gotten COVID 19 first shot. brainer getting shot reduce chances future problems substantially worth it. Yeah, know. makes sense. miss days kind thing crap people made fake internet points. fact multiple people believe sharing depressing. unvaccinated really selfish assholes‚Ä¶.? quite.
There plenty folks around panacea‚Ä¶ yet.
It‚Äôs incorrect lump unvaccinated one group, it‚Äôs extremely dangerous let get snowballed thinking one size fits solution readily available everyone‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. 

We still solve large part population told vaccinated yet‚Ä¶. (AIDS, Transplant patients, even auto-immune steroids patients).
And need solution even bigger part population approved vaccination yet (very young old depending country).
AND biggest issue all‚Ä¶ billions billions doses still needed poorer countries corrupt governments and/or suspicious population would rather kill representatives get vaccinated.

Viral transmission follows much effective global supply chain humans doesn‚Äôt give shit politics. sink swim together need hold leaders everywhere accountable reporting accurately. allow lazily hide behind sensationalist headlines filled accusations blame. job paid public servants solve solutions offer constant stream scapegoats plausible deniability scenarios.
Yes number unvaccinated issue‚Ä¶ done resolve resolved? FDA briefing document Pfizer: Moderna: believe looking sections describing study design.  Specific lists symptoms included. thing VT. slight increase may still look like 50% rise, way accurate picture things. We've single digits daily weeks. school opens go unfortunately luck runs it‚Äôll late. small chance person infected, small chance many millions getting infected. variants, guaranteed. 78.8% age 12. bad. fear setting four old back lost family covid. It‚Äôs awful Dad got one subsequently weeks ago. I'm much better stuffed ASS completely fucked see UK Need unemployment not? That's China rolls every winter. Many people wear public transport, stores etc. Totally normal. see flu cases fucking flatlined last winter US? many people think deadly side effects?

How many people deadly side effects covid? Yeah mind there's difference purposefully guaranteeing vaccine vs think small chance getting sick. understand different numbers are. fuck Vermont surging cases right now?! 85% adults least one dose vaccine consistently single digits new cases statewide weeks now. guess go 4 new cases day 6 technically 50% rise, pretty disingenuous. natural culling herd. think lot go Trump said, hes dipshit made pandemic political played significance, oh removed team handles stuff like . 

Now science deniers even empowered believe science root politics like American Football wont get vaccine spite ""Dems."" must good part VA lol. I‚Äôm SWVA idiots don‚Äôt even remember mask is. know vaccines work, antivaxxer either.

You need 100 percent protection effective vaccine. need many people take possible.

Even vaccine makes 50 percent less likely contract illness, get 100 percent group take it, cuts amount infections group half, group turn infect half many people normally would have. follow?

Now imagine vaccine cuts risk 80 95 percent also making less contagious get sick, whole hell lot less likely need medical attention. Like do.

A single person **much** less likely contract covid vaccination, people vaccinated, harder virus spread asking population. Nobody actually knows they're talking ever told would literally impossible get covid vaccination, sounds like thought worked. always find surprising people discount fact children infected schools powerful vectors disease within community. children live themselves. Schools industrial-scale infection mechanism. disease coming home them.  70% Americans obese worse Insurance companies must making killing this. Filling pockets big time Can‚Äôt quite put finger it‚Ä¶but feel like I‚Äôve seen one before‚Ä¶ Life extremely circumstantial. born another family could‚Äôve grown anti vaxxer. compassion Wow there‚Äôs guy Twitter feed commenting vaccinating personal choice go profile see complaining government medical program affects sick son attack. Social responsibility thee! Imagine thinking decision vaccinate anything selfish. buffoon. It‚Äôs corrected 2. I‚Äôm curious kids bmi‚Äôs are. I'm you. waited eligible analysis getting COVID second time vs getting shot dealing possible temporary side-effects. kinda run day second shot, nothing like two weeks count said, I've seen 9 monkeys, utopia, children men, stand, andromeda strain

12 Monkeys* people want go cruises right now...I guess probably cheap, stil... think many companies, schools,
And governments mandate vaccine fully FDA approved. immune would vaccination. last long. sounds like might clear health insurance works. premium pays care anyone insurance network gets COVID. people get COVID, insurance network raises premiums across board compensate. no, federal government foot bill COVID treatment. Yes, they've practically disappeared thanks COVID restrictions. less COVID mitigation place, guess also coming back? Cold viruses! can't find vaccines Japan? find hard believe. supply really scarce? thought Japan would much speed. Best luck. vaccinated January finished early Feb. they‚Äôre okay freeloading herd immunity generated us *are* getting vaccinated? They‚Äôre cool letting rest us go first get shots, sit back wait?


Being part society means things greater good. got first dose first week vaccine available US. colleagues checking case someone bad reaction. that‚Äôs risk 100% willing take order help get immunity rolling. 


We help we‚Äôre going teach herd immunity. you‚Äôre medically able get vaccine choose to, you‚Äôre making rest society work harder pick slack.  Yes CDC fucked big time saying vaccinated people go unmasked. way early. Masks absolute last restriction removed. fan trend, though get coming from. hospital spread (not nursing home, though) COVID almost nonexistent, scientifically speaking really effective way preventing spread. 

That said, going impose healthcare workers, impose every ""front line"" worker, every ""essential"" worker, every government employee, every teacher, every person government contract working company one. stop one industry seems like close problem. wish love something would post data it‚Äôs morbidity mortality rates. 

If thing spreading faster, less harmful, spreads like wild fire anti-vaxxed, already know vaccinated largely asymptomatic contract variant. high risk fully vaccinated, take cover. likely folks making strangers bar anyway. think FDA would willing discard reputation make worst case scenario worse?  Statistically negligible fine dandy kid. Life long symptoms someone 10 years old going lot longer someone 40. 

We also really know long term effects virus are. know vaccine virus, technology older virus protein used invoke immune response significantly simple virus. kid's long term safety, getting vaccine logical thing do.

If outbreaks schools close. to. need protect students. need protect teachers. need make sure virus chance mutate bring entire economy again. Around 10% population gotten covid. Around half fully vaccinated now. ballpark 40-50% population left, depending overlap long natural immunity lasts. Still surprisingly high. understand fda hesitant Finally, last (hopefully) wave mop antivaxers infected. best thing could hope burns population fast enough mutation limited.  friend mom unvaccinated. pretty liberal, dumb. Yeah, Tennessee news today bc firing vaccine director, look vaccination progress ooof feel bad impressed public health team - it‚Äôs painfully slow increments week week. 

1% one week, 2.5% week after, 1.5% that...it‚Äôs grind large health campaign hope least get big bump start grind out. 

Either way, it‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs way we‚Äôre going rest population: gradually chipping away refusers, one percentage point time. winter also 3 major American holidays involve multiple households traveling gather indoors think average study said giving everyone 100 bucks get vaccine would result something like additional 9 percent population getting vaccinated. US handed least order magnitude cash basically everyone living achieve 0% that. 

So yes, people's apprehension things usually actually pretty low level.  yea, read back thread, that's we're talking about. Without virginity?  

Wtf? two different maps showing two different things. 

One cases per 100k percentage change total cases last week. 

Of course Missouri cases California per populace, less people vaccinated almost one wears masks; however, rates continue places like California hospitals overrun again. 

The Delta variant 100-150% transmissible. could accelerate rather quickly nationwide. Malta here, herd immunity since May, 80%+ adult population fully vaccinated doses - cases highest yesterday since March. said, hospital numbers still low. government banned non vaccinated people entering country closed English language schools clusters. tests performed \*in hospitals\*, rather clinics pharmacies dedicated mass testing locations like. People choose vaccinate susceptible misinformation haven‚Äôt done bare minimum seeking evidence based information get people sick indeed public health nuisances blame prolonging pandemic well placed them. Would yoy extend anything arising poor decisions, COVID? I've make mind all. always quite fluid. conclusions typically well formed though, test forums this, bit stubborn. always take people say however, even seem dismissive first. not. One guy said 1in50, another guy said fuck get from, replied death vs case rate UK, 1in 50 (2.5%). That's it. came along... Bye Felicia simple fact matter people put pseudo science personal ego death. idiots run around thinking subject death illness. Speaking death, covid isnt number source death America , check cdc's website supply vaccines US. We'd 90% adults double vaxxed did. implying anything. want waste time people made mind might arguing bad faith. thus far think much discuss. hope examine information available one vaccines available you, decide get vaccinated. Damn, Covid turned straight right lib eh? Vaccines short acting prophylactic products cause long term effects. vaccines market caused long term effects observed trials. simply scientifically feasible vaccine would elicit permanent biological change person. It‚Äôs work. Fear unknown powerful thing, that‚Äôs exactly fear ‚Äúlong term effects‚Äù is. understand vaccines work, realize isn‚Äôt legitimate worry. I‚Äôm saying apprehension new vaccine isn‚Äôt valid, ‚Äúlong term effects‚Äù thing grounded facts scientific evidence. Fauci try influence FDA point? FDA decision recently Biogen already bad. students lucky you. families. 70+% adults 1 dose

It's actually higher. 70+% respect entire population. bad treatment unvaccinated isn‚Äôt making things better 

It‚Äôs individual term up? seem making assumptions parenting. suggest mind business stick know. ways. make need vaccinated go anything (restaurants, concerts, go airport, go work, go football games etc). proclaimed shit. land Oz wishing something true means comes true. gaslighting, disgraceful. Hey big shooter, doctors take hippocratic oath white coat ceremony medical school. oath take says treat patients best ability. doesn‚Äôt say pick choose believe deserving. Desantis would love see average age state go down, even means deaths due covid taking elderly! people realize Florida highest rate elderly (almost 20% citizens 65) Desantis hoping lot pass away Covid - fewer elderly means money state spend long term medical care health care costs Eh, way see people would voted whichever side got first. would Republicans another life, they'd thought ideological side things really contemplated direction want humanity go in, they're idiots support whichever side picked first.

Incidentally, describes 98% Republican party: idiots vote way parents important figures life vote way, adopt whatever argument heard convinced right side things even actually understand side arguments favor it. think unvaccinated people shouldn‚Äôt get treatment CoVid all, chose get vaccinated. Fuck em, I‚Äôm serious.  Also depends age factors See flair, need convince get vaccinated. I'm saying misunderstanding application statistics real world. Yes, 33mm / 600,000 roughly 1/55, mean person contracts virus \~1.8% chance dying.

Edit: like this: 

Say 100 people room make $20k per year, one person made 10 million dollars. *average* yearly income room (the mean) $118,000, time, 'average' (modal) income definitely $120k. That's fair point. misleading, representation whole population You‚Äôve proclaimed plenty, mental disability procludes speculating wildly public health, perhaps gtfo sub like this, save victim bullshit someone else, stop spreading vaccine misinformation. No, sucks. Sorry hear it, I‚Äôm glad post resonated many people. Edited title. read ""Covid-19: Promising findings CoronaVac new study - questions remain Delta variant"" Let ‚Äòem go, they‚Äôve made bed. Ok, sorry, I'm getting bit hostility made assumption implying something. mistake.

To answer question, already. gets ideas, fine new information, seek new sources interesting trustworthy information. friends entire family vaccinated 5 weeks ago last week got ro-ro. Amazingly selfish. Come on. 1/100 1/200 materially change argument. paper card. Countries like Israel France using verification systems. cold civil war It‚Äôs matter time ""The type person isn‚Äôt getting vax may also type person lies vax"" 

Obviously, people getting vaccinated resort lying feed kids. 66% right now? particularly. article written Singaporean audience, give full context. 

Cruising Singapore subject restrictions on-land activities - restrictions group sizes, masks outside rooms, social distancing. Additionally, need get swab test done board carry contact tracing Bluetooth device around boat. Finally, overall caseload Singapore pretty low (255 active cases 5.7M population, imported) 70+% population vaccinated least one dose. 

Protocols place eventuality looks like followed T. surprised turns form anything small cluster. statement equally troublesome attitude people get pushed fringes.
I take Information everywhere, mostly connect follow smart people, seek experts thier fields. things like seek people learn conversations like this. try sometime haha France announced starting August can't go caf√©s places unless vaccinated.

Following announcement biggest day vaccinations they've had.  say allowed discuss it? asked purpose discussing it? Why? hope accomplish here? learn? discourage people getting vaccine? Questions elicit discussion. *those* MSM Conspiracy. Plague Inc received massive negative votes unrealistically hard reality, politicians trying hard held event help spreading virus.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm still clear derive demonstration efficacy vaccines 3 smaller 4 hurrrrr  largely agree Pfizers rhetoric mostly cash grab right now, expert conjecture sight reason booster trials. may unnecessary, another piece puzzle; especially diminished ability fend respiratory virus.

To date, I've seen ChAdOx1 booster trial result I'm convinced ever get approved USA. Might well initiate booster trials approved vaccine. fail get prostate exam time end advanced cancer caught? ""Tough luck "" get exam day turned 50? 

Going road baaaaad idea. Anyone thinking smooth distribution curve complete moron. Oh I'm allowed participate conversation now? I'm allowed present alternative view question called facts? Come on. enjoy discussing issues face us. put ideas tested learn more. problem people throw shade mainstream media usually tune Infowars. risks happening null compared senior multiple comorbidities catching COVID-19 plane. risk catching COVID flight 1 4,300, applies strictly short-haul flights, study conducted Delta became dominant strain.

Also take account many people country vaccinated yet. Many flying US vaccinated. Again, know, likelihood ending hospital low. false equivalence way go. I've heard foreign Olympic staffs completely avoid necessary quarantine period walking freely around Harumi area Olympic staffs staying despite fact forbidden.

And started allowing Uber Eats harumi. Considering current vaccine ratio Japan(about 30% least first shot), Uber Eats contractors got shot all. risk life citizen Tokyo for... what? playing sports? risk lives totally non-essential event like Olympics? this, example also suffer serious disease death, due Delta happening more. much likely, enough kids still wearing masks. Look I'm statistician epidemiologist, trying give small amount validity dude said 1 50. Divide deaths cases see % get, convert % fraction. vaccinated mean get covid, means decrease symptom severity, typically enough require hospitalization. stopped first sentence. 
I hope feel good bullying people mental disabilities, that's right now.
You making wildly unqualified ad hominem statements towards someone tried proclaim anything, direct anyone, personally insult anyone. say you.
How know people smarter you? don't. stop disrespecting me, stop lying try humble hey. afraid friends family dismissive experience think judge careful enough? Yes, country anywhere selfish people. Unvaccinated young 30s folk friends circle worried potential effects future babies. know say get away subject. COVID going nowhere. coming back stronger faster. many things mentioned, contagious?

We already issues related price increases due lifestyle choices contagion risk mitigation process.

 personally support public funding tools help protect individuals unwanted consequences sexual intercourse personally recognize potential cost undesired consequences. f'ing moron putting others risk. Saying ""it's choice"" like saying choice want drive drunk. DeSatis: [Don‚Äôt tell business devil  Yeah. see point wearing mask staying home except truly essential trips many people living pre-COVID lives. punish others getting vaccinated? Unfortunately think help much, even 1/3rd 12-15 year olds gotten first shots, much parents want vaccinate kids necessarily. Obesity rooted genetics mental health, smokers often become addicts teenagers. Probably whole lot factors solutions would far much discuss here. really see light people hellbent science denial contributing spread deadly disease. people making conscious choice fueling pandemic. go again. Fuck economy. Lol believing china honest covid numbers.  Infection fatality rate estimated considerably lower, around 0.6%

[And varies greatly depending age, presumably risk Um....... vaccines around years know last years. Besides, vaccine based original variant, know need much higher antibody levels alpha able stand delta etc.  don‚Äôt idea get information, correct. know don‚Äôt get traditional methods like listening people smarter you, studying peer reviewed research, hell, basic observation. imagine it‚Äôs something maybe snorting? Ah ok. Well time available know lot it. Perhaps change mind then. wondering feel need comment article concerns vaccines US though? purpose commenting decided going get vaccine COVID? keep decision yourself? I'm even curious third dose study China. found 20x increase antibodies. Statistically 7/6 people bad fractions. Newsom‚Äôs ridiculous ‚Äúhonor system‚Äù vaccinated people masking indoors brought us point. say it‚Äôs ridiculous vast majority people know got vaccinated still wear masks inside, unvaccinated super proud bragging social media ‚ÄúF mask‚Äù take kids grocery shopping. course outbreak going come this.  talking shit. right Jin first half response, go lala land trying project failings onto me.
If think I'm going ""bad faith"", whatever means, mate trying take personally rather actually engaging pragmatic discussion. bet treatment thing would happen. couldn‚Äôt make vaccines, would focus creating better treatments people got infected, imagine we‚Äôd eventually able get deaths fairly acceptable level, would presumably long exhausting process- much worse vaccine solution real world.  Learn difference CFR IFR statistic apply us. Death car crashes definitely common country US. highlights:

- you‚Äôre vaccinated though, much dangerous time March 2020. transmission rate higher used be, catch Delta, you‚Äôre much likely die‚Äîor get Long COVID. extra careful, hang vaccinated people, avoid dangerous events.

- catching original COVID approximately doubled likelihood death age. means catching Delta approximately triples it.

- China, estimated viral load Delta 1,000 times higher original variant.

Lol young healthy fine. daughter 20's, came symptoms day get vaccinated. little headache sore throat days. went got vaccinated weeks after.    Interesting first thought health insurance. Mine life insurance. Judging OP's reply you, get impression that's implied. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup. VAERS mess. needs federally mandated standardised.  domestic QR code displays first letters first last name date birth.

The establishment checking supposed cross-reference ID lot places this. [Here's 23-minute John Oliver why.

My best attempt TL;DW: They're sorta like health insurance (in US system), completely unregulated. means, take every problem ever traditional health insurance company US, add religion, dial 11.

---

A longer explanation:

Remember traditional insurance used able reject pre-existing condition, much sucked? That's illegal... insurance. HSMs technically insurance, reject pre-existing conditions. Also fun things like going hospital that's out-of-network (even actual emergency can't fucking comparison-shop call 911), set arbitrary cap large expense they're willing pay.

Also, know annoying normal health insurance cover random things really seem like standard part healthcare, like dental? HSMs *long* lists things cover -- see personal moral failings, like:

* Substance abuse
* Mental health
* Obesity
* *Anything* alcohol-related -- seriously, woman beaten senseless taken hospital skull spinal fractures, claim rejected fault outside bar.
* Abortion
* Anything related sex outside marriage. (Got STD? They'll want hear story got it, make sure fornication.)
* bullshit holier-than-thou reason make spot.
* Oh, also, cover *preventative* care, either.

So, theory, guess reason people drawn is... kind thing people thinking maybe want anti-vaxxers burden healthcare system anymore. fault, right? mentality -- people sign say want premiums pay someone sat couch eating donuts got fat heart attack... Basically, want pay anyone think *chose* unhealthy. (Disclaimer: agree obesity choice, I'm trying explain think they're coming from.)

The thing is, HSMs caught spending well 80% income overhead (basically paying themselves). Less 20% money goes paying claims, probably long list excuses use reject claim want. Which, way, *exact opposite* traditional insurance. law, actual insurance US forbidden spending 20% overhead, 80% go actual claims!

In words, entire motivation joining one things save money more-efficient healthcare system include people like... well, save money, *less* efficient, there's good chance include all.

Oh, icing cake: Since they're insurance, basically healthcare providers way bill like they'd bill insurance. huge surprise hospital bill, pay pocket uninsured, try get reimbursed. friend came over. 

We watching movie. 

90/120 minutes in, like wacky arm waving inflatable tube man chair. 

100 minutes in, like ""I feel well"" I'm like ""Ok course finish another time"" goes ""No, we'll finish it.""

I ask what's wrong. Splitting headache. Okay.

Movie ends like delirious. casually mutters something getting vaccine earlier day. I'm like ""Holy hell, we're calling nurse line."" 

Call they're telling go hospital ASAP. Got Uber Bob's yer uncle. 

Her followup dose 8 weeks absolutely getting it. that's need know.  lol sure need reminder end? domestic QR code shows date birth initials.

Still enough verify high level confidence cross-reference ID lot places that. front line personnel must required, debate this. matter safety else. commenting long-term side-effects COVID vaccine say ""survived coronavirus?"" least 24 isolation infectious period

So looks like keeps getting worse?  absolutely catch spread COVID even vaccinated issue travel advisory downstate Illinois way worse shape unvaccinated people either Missouri Arkansas  yes, entirely possible

vaccinated people still need socially distance mask  Free riders people benefit public good don‚Äôt pay sacrifice it. case pandemic, free riders enjoy positive result people get vaccinated ‚Äî lower transmission virus eventual herd protection ‚Äî refuse take tiny risk get vaccinated themselves. challenge comes, course, lots people realize free riders, public good destroyed.

Charles Darwin wrote issue dealing evolution groups tribes. benefits tribe members cooperative, brave concerned other. individual tribe natural predisposition selfish individualist benefiting social virtues members. tribe maintain cooperation, courage mutual concern time?

Darwin pointed number means. particularly powerful ‚Äústimulus development social virtues,‚Äù wrote, people deeply concerned ‚Äúthe praise blame fellow-men.‚Äù Human beings avoid free riders shameful care reputations. Darwin added religion gives duties aura sacredness.

Certain social virtues become urgent covid-19 crisis. testing country weakened point. Many Americans lost sense share common enterprise ‚Äî part tribe. seem extraordinary future generations that, amid pandemic, used health policy political weapon culture war.

Yet people hesitant take vaccine, problem polarization conspiracy theories. inconvenience, needle fears vague sense personal risk. voice safety selfishness ear: headed toward herd immunity anyway, matter whether get vaccinated?

You probably hear assessment medical professionals, trained nonjudgmental. judgmental pretty much job description. So: healthy refuse take vaccine chance comes, free rider. gaining benefits living community without paying minimal cost. And, middle health emergency, shameful. past year, front-line workers ‚Äî especially health workers ‚Äî taken far greater risks day. Many paid lives. Many paying symptoms post-traumatic stress disorder. Next this, real risk getting vaccinated minimal. bad citizen don‚Äôt.

The reality, whether people like not, share community. owe much health happiness one another. bonds history duty deeper differences.

Performing duties without reward. personal benefit fulfilling civic responsibility ‚Äî sense pride shared purpose. vaccinated brings thrill freedom, allowing move world less fear. ultimate goal ‚Äî return normal life ‚Äî achieved act together. government utterly incompetent simplest tasks, coherent message masks surprise there. nurses fired Texas refusing get vaccine attempted sue case thrown out. always insufferable smug look face. decided cancel wintering plans florida 2nd winter row, I;m going exposed idiots, live lot cheaper elite feed you? 

Tell flunked high school without telling flunked high school ridiculous... different behaviors absolutely charged different premiums  sure, South East LA conservative hotbeds... uh huh...  virus spreads efficiently symptoms even appear. Death isn‚Äôt necessarily impact transmission virus.   luckily unvaccinated mostly centralized East South LA, vaccinated people smart enough never enter  Thanks confirming study lmao What? Cases aren‚Äôt reaching last years levels. Things sort following last years trend guess, cases especially hospitalizations way down. whole world needs this. less people getting tested. Someone posted pure numbers. Everything alright except Arkansas Missouri, nearly unmitigated dumpster fires new infections. Florida always ""?"" Desantis.  Calling people selfish know believe anymore helping anyone. shitty headline sometimes wonder main incentive try motivate ‚Äúvaccine hesitant‚Äù groups get vaccine. CDC said vaccinated people could unmask, saw lot bad takes social media (‚Äúwhy even bother getting vaccine still wear masks,‚Äù etc). maybe CDC thought people would get vaccine way.

Not sure whether paid that‚Äôs always assumption motivated change policy.

Then again, plenty US states got rid restrictions vaccine even around, there‚Äôs excuse flat-out ignorance I‚Äôve positive seeing ‚Äúcases rising‚Äù stories starting wear again. It‚Äôs starting seem going stuck cycle never seem escape. 

I think might cry see states start implement capacity limits again. right make others sick idiocy.  course. FL advertising unvaccinated safe haven. opted go year reason. start dying, they‚Äôll blame Biden somehow. visiting festivals concerts. Plus nasty variant could end jeopardizing efficacy vaccines (thus risking lives everyone vaccinated) could well come unvaccinated person. It‚Äôs matter time another variant crops knows it‚Äôll capable of. far we‚Äôve lucky vaccines held variants. shit talking Florida fine.  None evens aqeven close 1 10 chance death. Thank demonstrating fucking idea risk works. flights 1 10 chance crashing 90% people die 20 flights. also means 90% die partake 20 activities life.

If 98% chance living month 90% die 9 years. also anecdotes breakthrough cases of
vaccinated people wear masks. sure would saved mask. Her: That's spicey cough got babe. think get tested?
 
Him: No... I'll shut bedroom reason next two weeks. good. vast majority population vaccinated.

I fucking care variants. 

You right demand take medical procedure want.

Covid currently nowhere NEAR 1/50 death rate. Even 80+ 5% IFR. think so. went strict rules literally none right holiday season. Discotheques bars packed brim proper checks. weird terrible timing. virus going go away. simply realistic option. Sinovac fine, several countries using it, got approved already, effective Pfizer preventing deaths: things clean simple now. holding people responsible choices lead better choices made. Humans generally self-centered lazy, defer nature without motivation otherwise. believe Bill Gates put microchips vaccine. Like serious, people getting vaccine this‚Ä¶ agree ‚Äúheard‚Äù similar things Israeli ‚Äústudy.‚Äù I‚Äôve mostly citing others refute it. Wondering could share might found info properly controlling outside factors add URL artillery. Thanks!  Unless young like risk VIPIT increases dramatically younger are. loathe coworkers. loathe idea people work health care science field deny obvious put patients risk. young children. successfully avoided catching virus vaccinated exposure exposure. nearly 18 months bullshit still concerned bringing home 1 year old. people vaccinated testing positive. transmitting people cannot decided protected. step mother conspiracy theorist refuses get vaccinated thinks it‚Äôs government conspiracy Biden devil. loathing much greater coworkers, still think compelling argument mandate vaccine healthcare workers without doctors exemption.   Isn‚Äôt fact fine going to, minds, prove right? ‚ÄúSee, didn‚Äôt need take experimental vaccine!‚Äù Let spread kill wish to. could protect free weren‚Äôt stupid, can‚Äôt really anything point.

Vaccines seem protect vaccinated dangerous forms, safe. Flu us ICU them. Yeah here, delta variant contagious af  Trump tell people get vaccinated? Every article I'm finding saying Trump advised eligible people get vaccinated.

In June said 'very young people' get vaccine... CDC still recommending vaccine young children. I'm sure situation countries UK 50s children eligible annual flu vaccination. reason covid vaccines follow model. LA county like less 5% conservative? need find new scapegoat. agree. younger folks argument high risk themselves. Like everything COVID, argument protecting **others**.l getting vaccinated helping society return normalcy. fact others fails every time convince people.  Yeah limit number mutations we? responding wanted eradicate covid, would take stop mutations. Let‚Äôs hope enough get vaccinated herd immunity take affect. Nice. Israel booster Pfizer shots 2 enough apparently immunity wanes within 6 months! Seems widespread issue vaccines. tf subreddit lmao expecting everyone r/coronavirus epidemiologist? Exactly neighbor:

me: ""Why u vaccine?""

her: ""It's experimental""

me: ""What getting sick Covid?""

her: ""I'm worried health""

me: ""So matter vaccine experimental?""

*Logic breaks down*

her: ""*sigh* ... we'll never agree..."" likely issue gamma variant due proximity Brazil. None vaccines well one well. Good automod getting covid safer vaccine?  else yet gonna dem libs? What? really don‚Äôt die, get sick feel bad enough take seriously (hopefully)

Or least one close person social circle get sick experience see effects

Some people literally get noses rubbed something understand real  always advisory travel Arkansas. Arkansas. plenty people can‚Äôt get vaccinated even though might want to. yeah, willing unvaccinated spreading Covid isn‚Äôt problem willingly unvaccinated. Also, using healthcare resources affect people might need resources. again, unvaccinated doesn‚Äôt affect you. ""We pro-life children born. that, Toddler Battle Royale"" Incorrect, thanks playing. death rate much much lower 2%. number people throw around 0.6% remember comers includes sick elderly make majority 0.6%. risk dying young healthy crazy low like 1/10,000.

I vaccinated family vaccinated think everyone get vaccine risk vaccine much lower even one 10,000 rate. important keep numbers accurate. Romania college √Æs Free. sicken die, whatever. Apparently.  Flu vaccine 40%-60% preventing illness, death, comparing two wrong

It would easier compare Sinopharm vaccine others: e.g. Vaxzevria, Comirnaty 92%-96% effective preventing hospitalisations according uk data even better preventing death  true. Denmark bought 1 million unused Pfizer doses Romania nobody wanted them.. skepticism covid vaccine automatically result accused anti-vax vaccines?

It doesn't. plenty us capable discussing nuance. perpetuating problem claiming nothing. Half posts article anecdotes vaccine anything know someone got covid getting vaccinated. half people saying insurance companies raise premiums people want get vaccine apparently anything. 

Pure barbarism people neurotic enough still visit subreddit. doesn‚Äôt mention anything delta variant. incredibly ignorant. 
many jobs require vaccination. covid vaccine different. Again‚Ä¶ unvaccinated people, may die‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs problem again? point getting vaccine choice, opportunity world people get vaccine America. spreads people didn‚Äôt get vaccine choice, again, see problem.  Good luck. Hopefully resolves soon. Nice You‚Äôre absolutely right. don‚Äôt know long term effects vaccine. 


From understanding, vast majority side effects vaccine present short term (days/weeks). 


Again, alternative getting COVID dealing longterm side effects.  Nothing requires labor another person ever human right What? Including HPV, shown practically eliminate cervical cancer used teens years?  99 percent new infections, hospitalizations deaths covid unvaccinated people. 

They'll take innocent people them, suffering deaths alone. see ""fertility"" concern come frequently. annoying thing is, excellent data vaccines affect fertility, well promoted people know exists.

""TL;DR: **Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups**. one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 affect fertility.""

/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/comment/ggb3d65

We also large studies people pregnant got vaccine, found vaccines safe. ( 35,700 vaccinated pregnant women, rate complications normal rate complications unvaccinated pregnancies.)

We also data males vaccine decrease sperm count cause issues. Review inspection two different things. sure point making. spread people. That‚Äôs problem. Enormously selfish? don‚Äôt understand push vaccines. vulnerable don‚Äôt get vaccine? US Media thing.  decent person. Yep. spread Victoria thanks lack action. 1% change, probably enough tip scales. What's rush vaccinate kids? focusing getting whole worlds vulnerable populations vaccinated first Social Darwinism never let us before. Except, know... studies long term (or short-long term) effects covid kids? guy moron. 
seriously. know level sterile immunity, chances giving someone else decrease. got second last night muscle aches diziness today it‚Äôs worth it. We‚Äôve mixing matching second doses Canada got Pfizer first time Moderna second. didn‚Äôt reaction first does. Yeah, said, lot undiagnosed cases. problem significant amount 27% part 52% vaccinated. 

There's lot factors like high use AZ reduced efficacy Delta.

The point making vaccinated enough prevent actual third wave, although might better first second waves, risking thousands deaths virus. 

The Government handled appallingly year, want clear third wave result action (or lack thereof), failure vaccinations. I'm schools businesses requiring vaccine go back work. want get vaccinated? That's choice, get infect others anymore. Period, full stop. Life = 100% death.

Period.

Vaccine no.  ok take break. pandemic life harder normal right now, Florida best make things even harder. make something feel unsafe expectations others yourself. I'm staying job pay enough want work remotely right matters more. excited though think future COVID better move blue state better vaccination get job want field! might able put PhD hold come back year -- programs allow things. lot places hiring remote work right now. follow one really stressful year another one? say I'm re-enter PhD program taking time death family, teaching I'm candidacy, nothing on-campus me. is. we‚Äôve lost 1.07% entire population 65. reached point unlikely contained. think skewed perspective. Much US pull bootstraps face numerous hurdles along way. It‚Äôs impossible, stacked greatly you. people US want fame glory without putting soul crushing amount work attain it. see gazillionaire Jeff bezos want money don‚Äôt think sacrifices work put get Amazon now. 
There lot people born advantages much easier path. whining can‚Äôt make anything country people risk lives reach fleeing socialist communist countries sake opportunity basic liberties insulting fought protect it.

The US‚Äô failures entirely hands ‚Äúpublic servant‚Äù politicians decades peddled promises people line pockets (often generations political lineages). Want real change benefits people? Let‚Äôs go back politicians volunteer community service pay. Yes hello Bunzilla.


I‚Äôm bridge sales pitch. 0%

Absolutely nobody holding full approval legitimate reason so. 100% antivaxxers spreading propaganda bullshit. Believe not, alot everyone, including idiots.

Abstract

 
Background: Nutritional status influences immunity specific association susceptibility COVID-19 remains unclear. examined association specific dietary data incident COVID-19 UK Biobank (UKB). Methods: considered UKB participants England self-reported baseline (2006‚Äì2010) data linked Public Health England COVID-19 test results‚Äîperformed samples combined nose/throat swabs, using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)‚Äîbetween March November 2020. Baseline diet factors included breastfed baby specific consumption coffee, tea, oily fish, processed meat, red meat, fruit, vegetables. Individual COVID-19 exposure estimated using UK‚Äôs average monthly positive case rate per specific geo-populations. Logistic regression estimated odds COVID-19 positivity diet status adjusting baseline socio-demographic factors, medical history, lifestyle factors. Another model adjusted COVID-19 exposure. Results: Eligible UKB participants (n = 37,988) 40 70 years age baseline; 17% tested positive COVID-19 SAR-CoV-2 PCR. multivariable adjustment, odds (95% CI) COVID-19 positivity 0.90 (0.83, 0.96) consuming 2‚Äì3 cups coffee/day (vs. &lt;1 cup/day), 0.88 (0.80, 0.98) consuming vegetables third quartile servings/day (vs. lowest quartile), 1.14 (1.01, 1.29) consuming fourth quartile servings processed meats (vs. lowest quartile), 0.91 (0.85, 0.98) breastfed (vs. breastfed). Associations attenuated adjusted COVID-19 exposure, patterns associations remained. Conclusions: UK Biobank, consumption coffee, vegetables, breastfed baby favorably associated incident COVID-19; intake processed meat adversely associated. Although findings warrant independent confirmation, adherence certain dietary behaviors may additional tool existing COVID-19 protection guidelines limit spread virus.

Tennessee's children danger. state halted outreach minors vaccines, Covid, antivaxxers entrenched hoping there's child endangerment legal loophole stop anyone access  Tennessee! great place live work! said one.  Fingers crossed. Well, covid vaccines makes sense compare them. want immunity you‚Äôre going waiting perdition. saying shouldn‚Äôt stay home 45 million adults likely definitely won‚Äôt get shot, plus kids now, going slow burn. say, encouraging numbers. Counterpoint - Covid symptoms least 5 days started difficulty breathing, likely infected least day two that. 

I hospitalised fortunately still cant breathe nearly year line.

Edit: counterpoint wanted add anecdote quickly came on, dispute experiences.  Nah. get mad title. study that? would appear mRNA vaccine actually produce robust protection higher anti-bodies.

Thanks reply however following link concerning vaccination general mention: ""You also sponge lukewarm water. **Cold baths/showers recommended.""**

Here's link: mention ""Mild temperature fever""

Why advising that? Especially since imagine lot vaccinated people getting tests  honestly think media ignores liability assuming even outbreaks confirmed. example, local news station Roanoke area received cease desist letter American Airlines pertaining ""potential"" bad superspreader event happened flight DC ROA. companies routinely send letters media quash stuff hits bottom line. think filters planes good people think. student maintains small regional jets ""subsidiary"" American Airlines states sometimes replace filters literally ""clogged"" mold them. Filters changed months years regular maintenance. small regional airlines partner big guys, seems like scrutinized much larger companies larger planes are. Many companies may look like operate as, let us say, Delta, considered wholly separate companies lax maintenance.  What's encouraging news?

I'm asking betting markets moving news me. I'd interested hearing supposedly reacting to. best tell either flew Delta Dulles American Regan. routes E170 E175 aircraft came standard HEPA filtration recirculated air. Even air circulation good amount new air brought cabin. People know damn well 2020 restrictions would happened SARS COV 2 trigger cold symptoms people. Hell, death toll remained China-tier levels--yeah, yeah, numbers sus--we still would seen lot restrictions. Come on. scientific community pretty aware flaws study outright stated such. Even Journal published study retracted fairly fast. 
Andrew Wakefield went tell whole world opinion oppressed right one else understands it. point, even people credited study said full holes want associated it. 
It's like Andrew Wakefield fault publishing shit study + things afterwards. enough stimulus money also explanation rise, since people struggle feel need self-medicate.  70% high end, 30% low end, depending state county. Definitely true, vaccinated odds bad outcome actually drop flu. Covid's estimated IFR 0.6%, flu's 0.1%. I've seen different sources think conservative estimate vaccination prevents 95% deaths, meaning Covid's IFR would fall 0.03%, less third flu.

I think hard sell say Covid risk fully vaccinated person flu, even though quite bit contagious. point unless we're trying eradicate Covid, we're going live comfortable level.  stop  No, take temperature shower want. It‚Äôs also fine take fever reducing medications you‚Äôve shot, before. Polymarket many intriguing prediction markets COVID. I've followed along months now. That‚Äôs exactly point. common point view asymptomatic mild cases post vaccine zero concern - even track them, let‚Äôs act true.

However point view isn‚Äôt based evidence I‚Äôve seen published (not I‚Äôve read everything!). 

I agree logically tracks there‚Äôs *some* reduction long term symptoms breakthrough infections. 

Given asymptomatic/mild/moderate cases (prevaccine) lasting physiological changes/symptoms don‚Äôt good measure prevalence non-hospitalized breakthrough infections long term health outcomes infections, follows maybe it‚Äôs premature say infections don‚Äôt matter. plausible *increase* pandemic related. 

There substantial increase 2020, eclipsing increases previous years. wonder big event 2020 could potentially help explain that? 93% hospitalization Delta. still get infected much easily deal organ damage fun stuff comes along ""mild"" infection. want smell taste go back normal. I'm pushing nine months nonsense. 

Does anyone know anyone figured stays messed long it'll ever get back normal? countries, like Italy. We're still vaccinating full speed, 550k doses/day less 5M doses left stock yesterday. moment they're mostly wave second doses, lot people still waiting first waiting while.  

Before Macron's speech vaccinating 700k day, around 500k 2nd doses around 200k first doses. difference here. (fully vaxxed) family never stopped wearing masks. We're L.A. 

The virus probably kill us, still want get sick. cases spiking L.A. County we're back double-masking stores.  *So called ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù analysis 14,019 cases Delta variant UK, released Public Health England June, found BioNTech/Pfizer Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines were, respectively, 96 per cent 92 per cent effective hospitalisation two doses.*

Hell yeah. 

Now need get something kiddos. Ok we're semantics now, yes may describing sterilizing immunity, agree overall summary. simply data yet long term clinical significance breakthrough infections are. 

I'll infer, maybe even assume, know thus far, overall there'll long term clinical significance mild breakthrough infections. however acknowledge could wrong look forward data becomes available. problem COVID waaaaay contagious flu. even rates severity per case flu, would still far, far dangerous overall.

(Heavy sigh) spread recklessly. Right, agree does. everything know indicates vaccinations prevent ""long covid"" post viral syndrome. That's experts telling us fixated breakthrough cases.   best data line that, though. Efficacy hospitalization delta variant somewhere low-to-mid 90%'s.

Which means increbly rare. Yeah think would call breakthrough infections ""rare"", also think point, vaccinated, kind decide risk level. really want get sick, take precautions, ok chance (albeit still 85% protection) getting lesser version covid little chance serious, understand wanting get rid many precautions. Air travel safe. reality, something airlines want believe something US government conveniently looked into. Canada came studies contradicted ""it's safe fly"" stance. Apparently doctors California that. This. Delta variant, fully-vaccinated person get really sick, longterm damage, long covid, etc though significantly-reduced chance happening. Still, NONE tracked CDC since it‚Äôs part hospitalization/deaths track. 

It‚Äôs serious failure part CDC track data breakthrough cases‚Ä¶ Plus, caused many people assume fully-vaccinated means pandemic covid doesn‚Äôt really hurt kids. 

This leads things like kids covid symptoms parents getting tested even caring might covid‚Ä¶ leads fully-vaccinated people thinking whatever want‚Ä¶ Yet fully-vaccinated people transmit covid‚Ä¶ Plus, every case chance mutation better evade vaccine. 

Folks need step up. I‚Äôm fully-vaccinated, I‚Äôd fool think means I‚Äôm invincible happens others doesn‚Äôt matter. Weirdness smells tastes thing happens it‚Äôs coming back. bout anosmia totally different virus years ago, sense smell *and* weirdness started coming back really suck.

That‚Äôs great. personally done ‚Äúyou you‚Äù aspect pandemic. Mississippi one worst vaccination rates country. Yes, truly unfortunate see plays social media commentary, especially sub. Everything say true, kids still need vaccinated studies conplete. low risk covid, spread much, risk vaccines extremely low, every bit helps. eradicate, better, especially reducing odds new deadlier variants developing. cost/benefit thing. Obviously far important every adult get vaccinated, wait happen moving kids. That‚Äôs binary point view. Death complete health.

Reality much nuanced people experience reduction quality life long period time. really wonder many antivaxers hang sub‚Ä¶ Yeah, rarely‚Ä¶. point vaccine prevent severe covid hospitalization, quite effective. rest icing cake. I'm surprised they're still tracking cases are? (the county) call tested positive? tracer get involved? guess thinks going away...... feeling?

Well me, right ideas, discuss debate, trashing people.

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccines given [HAVE passed 3rd phase vaccine completed. Yes, might enough time take step back luxury afford, morbid luxury cost lives every single day. However still disagree, authoritarian move : one forced vaccinate. kidnap people forcefully inject vaccine. said vaccinated restricted go places receive public, health workers, stop working long conforming law. frankly, hoping solution close everyone. ask yourself, better accept vaccinated people still client, closing everyone client said since beginning learn live virus

Well sorry that's kinda looser attitude man. eradicated smallpox, almost eliminated polio, tetanus... common disease. first fight diseases, one win. even fail eradicate covid, vaccine way go back normality : can't put everyone hospital, even 50000 people intensive care much health system. cannot dimension health crisis reference nonsense waste Macron definitely reducing capabilities hospitals

Ding ding ding ! winner ! something politicians said reality, false. I'll explain way Olivier Verran, Heath Minister. know much cost intensive care bed ? 2k‚Ç¨/day, that's price even unoccupied. know, bed unoccupied : remove it. yeah reduce capacity indeed. half sentence : need again, open back. Macron reduce capacity hospital, made flexible. Getting tired these.

Maybe long covid read neurological impact particular areas brain controlling taste smell.  feel pain. least, risk complications young people low. Also many schools following CDC US saying masks population US 14 times higher Australia, also live island stop travel much easier lol  I've eaten street food 3rd world shitholes health standards, good food, get sick. 

If food stand restaurants serve food makes people sick they'll go outta business real quick. 

This really irrelevant discussion though, Florida bar cruise ships enforcing company standards, especially foreign flagged vessels. 

Sorry like comparison. RIP mom wouldn‚Äôt. would stabilized weren‚Äôt actively dying follow specialist visits, medication, non-life saving surgeries would performed. sounds like problem individual airline instead generalized issue trying pass as. Companies like American Airlines Spirit Airlines bad reputations reason, bad find hard way.   never felt pain bad head life.

So probably like upper respiratory infections. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll end pandemic‚Äù enough carrot. mRNA modified Delta. vaccinating original wild type. newer vaccines tested already using modified version spike works better variants.  Man know leaving small comment leaving bit insensitive hope get better. Thank lmao. 100% Source? Less half country vaccinated pandemic R 7: ""Pandemic's over! Happy July 4th!""

New wave forms two weeks later: *shocked pikachu face*  good friend mine lost cousin Fentanyl last year well. I‚Äôm tired people like, ‚ÄúJust let die, good riddance.‚Äù People sick treated. Society failed friends relatives suffer well. :( even include phrase ""if enough adults get vaccinated""

Let's start estimating number children die year, place number squarely shoulders anti vaxers. father passed overdose. struggled addiction whole life think pandemic allowed accelerate already doing. mental health important people. see therapist (if afford) least talk issues someone. people care, always person willing help struggle. cope unhealthy ways, affects you, around well. would probably fewer conspiracy theorists ‚Äúdelta variant‚Äù didn‚Äôt sound like made virus 1998 made-for-TV film. like everybody got vaccinated NYC feels pretty open. Yes lot people still mask going grocery store plenty people inside bars without masks. feels lot different last summer. Cases low last summer restrictions eased things way relaxed now. bump cases seems make sense. 

I think pockets outbreaks don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll need go huge lockdown. could see schools needing closed something like 12s able vaccinated dont really good sense schools faired all. 

Because high percentage risk people vaccinated don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see crazy uptick hospitalizations deaths. think go bit next couple weeks don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ton people aren‚Äôt vaccinated part ones weren‚Äôt masking height winter wave. 

If look UK cases gone ton since beginning June death rates shot roof. 

Yes there‚Äôs people can‚Äôt vaccinated health reasons there‚Äôs kids think think worried they‚Äôre going careful masked up. 

I saw pretty first hand hard pandemic hit hospital near always around 8 ambulances park street bunch EMTs congregating case now. things feel different hospitals way less busy. 

All said I‚Äôm wrong need go back lockdown prevent hospitals overwhelmed hard year negative consequences social distancing. Florida still first wave point. sucks point anyone do? message long prevent COVID transmission, vaccines free accessible. point give folks believe science? Vaccinated people get sick rarely exhibit severe symptoms. matter much mild cold case: something actually think about. okay, i'm waiting punchline Still denying Harlem general lower vaccination rates rest Manhattan.

Harlem different rest island. pass 96th St island changes dramatically. I'm saying conflate Harlem rest Manhattan they're different, culturally economically (and strictly positive negative way either). Compare adverse outcomes children vaccine vs COVID. *did* include facts, pulled straight opinion piece linked. 20 1,000,000 children die COVID. many children died result vaccine (Ill give hint, less 20 1,000,000). adverse outcome figures similar across board. 

I wouldnt deny child anything. Im fully favor allowing unvaccinated children legitimate religious medical exemption public life. important everyone else children interact get vaccinated. choose get vaccinated get child vaccinated, conscious choice. one denying child access experiences. want participate public institutions, need willing follow basic public safety guidelines. arent, well, get wait longer danger others. 

This new phenomenon. 12 years ago H1N1. every year MMR. Vaccines required attend public school. correct. look chicken pox vaccine. Tons kids vaccinated still end catching disease, typically manifests light rash mild fever opposed something severe keeps bedridden multiple days. especially relevant us fully vaccinated live someone high-risk *can't* get vaccine. father almost 70 heart attack waiting happen. also anaphylactic reactions flu vaccines past, can't vaccinated dependent rest us keeping virus away him. still spread it, want fucking know protection game keep safe. think societies around world end collapsing one day. probably still hang hundred, maybe thousand years, dumbest Bubba redneck push us around one man disease pollution factory, we're thin ice. lower mortality rate, long covid rate much higher. Folks look mortality. :( restaurants serve raw chicken government said want get customers sick lose silly question.

We standardized health codes reason. Also watch show like kitchen nightmares bar rescue see many corners restaurants willing cut. matter get infected it‚Äôs gonna put hospital? don‚Äôt get organ damage don‚Äôt serious infection. want stay lockdown covid wiped planet stuck house 2077. I!  worry vaccinated self give unvaccinated special needs child life. visited spring know I'll able again.

At least ERs stressed capacity anymore. work literally entire world once. Otherwise always going new introduced cases. needs comic sans option restaurants serve raw chicken government said want get customers sick lose money?

That's silly question.   many people get covid report symptoms? Before. Loss/altered taste smell literally symptoms too.  India went this, basically develop natural herd immunity that's we're seeing drop cases there? Correct person said ‚Äúnow need get something kiddos‚Äù something kiddos. vaccine deemed less risk give go ahead. children go vaccine heart inflammation died? It‚Äôs risk either way. low risk severe infection virus low risk complications vaccine. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt slow reopening children vaxxed. happens they‚Äôre vaxxed?

We make specific concessions property rights open business public benefit. logically speaking, property serve someone raw chicken, no? put ipecac restaurant soup property, no?  NYC resident wide social business network I... heard one time yet.

Not saying true, saying anecdotal stuff like productive Lets little math here. 

If Delta variant R0 8, need 90% protection get herd immunity. 

If 75% protection mNRA vaccines contracting delta variant, even vaccinated 100% population..... can't get anywhere near herd immunity. Let's see effective mRNA vaccines Delta variant go clamoring this. far they've effective Isreal showing infections Delta far greater (6.7x) vaccinated people naturally recovered prior covid infection.  /r/travel first vaccine shot, feel like several days. Nothing would snap it. tired, headaches, low motivation. forced run energize myself. 

If that's long Covid like, absolutely feel bad long haulers. Anti-vaxxers proclaim, ""FEAR MONGERING LEFTIS MEDIA"" get virus. subreddit discusses travel restrictions covid?  Yeah, see that's going go. Let Darwin Darwin best. rent mother in-law apartment family 2 kids. 7 5. lease laundry place.

I live alone, home, high risk Covid, till recent vaccination really distanced visits mom warm months since 2020. 

I'm still keeping bubble super small know could capable carrying upstairs them.

they leaving people's hands, plan removing *all* legal mandates kinds regarding covid. extremely sad unfortunate. safe means literally one ever catch COVID plane, no, air travel safe neither anything else around people. Knowing people catch COVID flight saying people likely catch COVID flight.

Personally, want live destroyed lungs. want anyone else either. Double lung transplants occurring record paces. people die, yet. survived virus, get live next 3-5 years struggling breathe body finally rejects transplant. even worst outcome.

Death metric, hard concept people. doctor roulette, though.

Solution, get vaccinated. Boom, problem over. bro. need lockdown permanently. It‚Äôs way make sure everyone safe. Furthermore lets ban cars, everyone even safer!!! anyone familiarity law explain why, since international ports automatic federal jurisdiction, case all? vaccine check happens federal port, state law even jurisdiction?

I'm saying school districts try get things. definitely should. masks help reduce transmission droplets, asymptomatic carriers like kids wear least try reduce spread covid. Masks also help prevent spread illnesses. means kids school time likely get sicknesses coming school year. 

Until adults get vaccine, schools able mandate vaccine students, mitigate spread.

It‚Äôs like flu. flu sends kids icu Correlation? There's correlation place. even know means? claiming fantastical causal relationship, based simple facts, mind leading outrageous claim conspiracy. 

Stop silly insults, help case. Neither 100% unsubstantiated claim falsifying data part lockdown conspiracy.  
The Tucker Carlson trick, implying silly theory questions, followed ""I know"" disappointingly weak . wanting distance fantastical theory understandable, really ought it, proper debate. Let's hear it, deep state all, whatever amazing factless fiction . it.

You presented video politician describing hypothetical situation generate noise cause death data. surprise you? sure work healthcare? There's always risk noise cause death data. Testing 100% either. fact. present nothing indicates perfectly normal phenomenon happens significant level, enough skew results.  
Also, nothing video backs claims admissions. cause death dealt with. original claim still suspended void, nothing backing up.

Let's break logic: 

* vaccinated
* follow guidelines
* see Covid cases causing problems - anecdotally

Then think people would consider cause-effect relationship vaccinations, following guidelines, fact pandemic still fairly contained. fairly known stuff. True, tried tested decades. no, would easy, logical you, it? 
So go! Uou deduct numbers deflated purpose. locally, randomly, full-blown systemic shadow practice. present one hypothesis explain this: motive lockdown itself! explanation, insight might agenda, objective might behind it.

 self explanatory think? agreeing denier? Head ass? Watch video? think watched video? 

You're bringing hot air broken logic fact fight. again: stop spreading misinformation. feelings facts. I'm sorry, there's really nice way tell this. Stop. stop.

It‚Äôs easy see actual % COVID cases need hospital care, look group subject required testing (teachers, students, athletes, etc.), compare total positive tests hospitalizations group. actual answer around 3%, 20%.  Yep! pneumonia‚Äôs (which checked tested sepsis) severity symptoms tracks risk coagulation.

Where Covid-19 different risk doesn‚Äôt track perceived symptoms.

It‚Äôs FDA approved emergency use, warranted considering raging pandemic vaccine releases. think read governor. say think comment taken down. saying flat refuse treat them. you‚Äôre community outbreak hospitals fill, catch COVID need ventilator, someone else needs ventilator car crash whatever, bad you‚Äôre unvaccinated.

Yeah, might well hope vaccine passports, that's likely. Masks cheap people already one. state overall 50% fully vaccinated yet county thankfully tad 50% fully vaccinated. moment CDC made announcement requiring masks fully vaccinated people state followed recommendation. see almost mask wearing pubic indoor facility. math vaccination rate least 50% unmasked people likely unvaccinated. know sure children 11 younger unvaccinated qualify vaccine yet. almost every child see unmasked.

Also believe get reporting bias dificult people know FDA database, mostly family doctors reporting they've medial social pressure due set high bar it. known prior 2020 4:1 underreporting.

Usually databases meant phase 3 trials, type gathering done manufacturers like normally normal FDA approval.

We'll see vaccination rates UK, Israel already high, need collect good data field, worry 60+, 18-24 I've seen UK reports. know. Maintaining school buildings priority US. Well got tinnitus Moderna reported it, said getting multiple reports tinnitus. Tinnitus ringing ears mine gone away 3 months. morally reprehensible sentiment. suppose also believe doctors treat patients will? all, doctor knows best. you‚Äôre taking isn‚Äôt ridiculous degrading, it‚Äôs paternalistic flat ethically disastrous.


The doctor example gave almost Socrates‚Äô counterargument democracy. doctor know best patient, given choice patient deceived lying ‚Äúsweet shop owners‚Äù speak appealing lies. decision given patient, uninformed patient choose listen sweet shop owner make worse decision themselves. sense democracy, doesn‚Äôt literally effect body person rather foundations nation, don‚Äôt come argument ‚Äúbut think doctor intervene patients body will?‚Äù same. it‚Äôs degrading all. average person simply isn‚Äôt qualified enough know statecraft works, hence qualified enough comment says that? ‚ÄúOften said‚Äù ass.

Idea benevolent king (dictator) leading utopia old democracy itself. Plato Socrates advocates rule competent benevolent kings rather democracy person, without depth knowledge statecraft, vote governance. Modern examples include Ataturk Turkey Tito Yugoslavia, brought stability prosperity otherwise doomed nations. Yet passed away, non-benevolent rulers took place things went south opposed dictatorships, classically oppressive inefficient.

I‚Äôm defending dictatorship, I‚Äôm talking benevolent dictatorships? point doesn‚Äôt make safety well-being people ensure rights. Including, certainly limited to, right elect leaders.


Right elect leaders definitely necessary society reach prosperity. well-being human way correlated picking leaders live prosperous word salad.

Calling argument nonsensical providing counterpoints lazy. How‚Äôs nonsensical? Disregarding possibility short-sighted. Advanced AI see movies science-fiction aren‚Äôt. well implemented governmental bodies. One full course two-dose vaccine protocol.

To knowledge research (1) ""mixed brand"" vaccination (there Canada) (2) ""over vaccination"" (more vaxes protocol prescribes.) middle July. Covid still here! Doesn‚Äôt know said would gone June 1st!!??!?!!? Teach us effing lesson quit! That‚Äôll teach us! raised public school teacher, get it.  Another reason could also possibly unapproved efficacy. vaccine last long enough effectively mitigate virus significant periods time population, would need improved. could potentially safe small amount population shows negative side effects still meet efficacy requirements. 

There IAMA doctor said FDA approving covid vaccine based efficacy/longevity already proven safe.

The 6 month waiting period proof FDA needs observe efficacy. people immune compromised like toddler still catch it. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm pissed get say it. Government knows best. Frankly, antivaxxers already side-effects people anyway. Non-approval would last thing need. red KY is, I‚Äôve SOOOOOOO happy Andy Beshher(D) governor Covid (which think main difference KY TN). 

I imagine shit show KY would Matt Bevin (R) still governor. Can't soft crime. annoying honest. genuinely trying give nuanced and, best knowledge, accurate information. comment sub isnt optimistic done away fearmongering gets kneejerk downvotes.

I want pandemic much next person. think obvious point western world worst behind us. doesnt mean ignore news points potential complications. Didn‚Äôt move responsibilities TN department education instead? California *entire* pandemic. state *wants* strict, also like 36,000,000 people, half want follow strict rules. 

So state hems little bit. Don‚Äôt forget mention Taliban (which article mainly talks regards anti vaxxers) polio vaccines think it‚Äôs ‚Äúespionage‚Äù. 

You‚Äôd make stronger point comparing ‚Äúautism‚Äù anti-vaxxers terrorists. 2 things stating here: vaccine availability government corruption. SEA countries' governments corrupt. likely get kickbacks deal. different issue picking one vaccine kickbacks. specifically mentioned Pfizer's vaccine either conveniently left part infrastructure problem using storage temperature know it. Pfizer's feasible option country wanted vaccinate population. Indonesia finally getting large dose now. Watch available specific large cities one two locations. Last heard, they're reserving frontline medical personnel first since CoronaVac cutting them. uncomfortable truth! Fully vaccinated people still wearing masks avoiding people like plague. Won‚Äôt see gatherings going around unmasked. Haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt want body. Even virus life sentence future issues. ran study random assignment tested difference proportions. whole point control random chance people would see effects keeping trials open (to look quality life, long-term survival, etc) referred phase 4 trial/postmarketing surveillance? Well, people understand statistics anyway. guess think dead child better autistic child (even though theres god damn link vaccines autism). Fighting immediate family (Dad, Mom, sister) let inside house kids get vaccinated. 

I firm, told judge personal decision, minute kids get vaccinated totally on, then, outside only, masks. 

They treating like pariah this. 

This far hardest part pandemic far. dad compared wearing masks german jews getting tattooed, mom said ""blackmailing"" her, I'm officially taking much space something gets resolved. got kids sick would extremely difficult forgive them. Same, want go back school, start whole new career path(fire fighting) gi Bill considering daycare 2 year old sun. guess rest year. also help fact husband deployed next 10 months :( son again. barely holding on. happen know get original report efficacy, one specifically describes testing methodology? 

Did rely self-reporting see many people ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù? 

I‚Äôm also curious timeframe watched symptoms. 

Thanks! vaccines, dont know media still posting cases. Almost every public health authority using hospitalizations key indicator. Hospitalizations increasing substantially agree everything saying, I'm still trying remind people cautious kids. 5-7 developing life long symptoms would lot suffering. 10 got bad respiratory infection body never recovered from. I've mild asthma recurrent pneumonia last 20 years. course made high risk COVID October caught it, horrible, far sick average 30 year old COVID. youngest COVID patient seen ER, definitely younger most. long haul symptoms started. direct result infection young.

Again, disagreeing you. kids get perfectly fine. nephew ran fever less 24 hours runny nose two three days. bouncing around entire time, much dad put together swing set/play center play go park get energy him. even bothered test sister's roommate tested positive. ultimately fine, like kids are, still worried me. circle, it‚Äôs immigrant first generation (born US) Hispanic diehard conspiracy theorists aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. Reagan Republicans vaccinated. Pssst...hey earth, chance! sure beginning feel way little there. know wrong say fully vaccinated person really care. small minority people gotten vaccine due actual medical reasons. rest honestly feel much remorse for. still every opportunity protect around don't. feel bad kids punished them.  What's Tater Tot say this? high percentage public pay attention understand much anything. That's need rational leadership. Sadly, half American public vote Republican despite decades Republicans showing give even tiny shit publics welfare. bad leadership harmful destructive leadership working worsen pandemic political gain. 100% willing go distance learning next day 

you mean parents willing pay approach. notice price point school (lower schools area) willing return old methods soon conveniently possible (read: less $$$) Euro 2020, played 2021 comparing winter surge numbers? winter 3 major holidays within month half people traveling cross country gather people indoors. Wait winter compare winter numbers lol live medical debt. I‚Äôm tired paying freeloaders. needs serious consequences behaviors choices. Social safety nets important unavoidable events truly need help, protect lazy selfish. What's age? Height weight? Autoimmune nothing it, get vaccinated. Data fine. rheumatologist.

Especially unvaccinated insist grouping every opportunity (i.e. Wembley Stadium, Olympics) Stupid play health like that. There‚Äôs little proof third vaccine safe even effective yet. Wait studies. people want live police state. virus distraction government abuse civil liberties.  12 can't vaccinated yet. Exactly many countries like us trying desperately squash virus first came out.

Instead let super spreader countries forced face consequences actions despite successes. pretty sure theyre still testing. get weekly reports instead daily reports tell brother plans take vaccine gets final approval.  want part someone's science experiment. world would next? mean summer camp group kids/younger adults gathering large groups hand full adults supervising them..

COVID fatality rate extremely age-dependent; CDC stats say someone age 85+ 15x likely hospitalized 610x likely die 18-29 year Yeah I'm sure would stop people. Plenty shots locales now, ask much sign saying got first shot elsewhere.

Your thinking wrong. Reference 2019 car fatalities lmao pressed. bet tiny little fists balled hard right now

The problem isn‚Äôt primarily kids missed shots 5-6 years. problem antivax movement growing strength despite common sense reality says. don‚Äôt need know vaccines don‚Äôt cause autism like don‚Äôt need know exactly landed humans moon. need able accept basic truths reality though sufficiently demonstrated. large swaths population incapable that, well end Tennessee.  feel post bones. me?

I'm impressed pedantry tbh   making sense. Current data shows natural immunity wins much vaccine-induced immunity, i'ma stay vegan one

No, [Vaccines give immunity [compared natural Also, [a single shot Pfizer prior COVID infection shown induce greater immune response compared  Wow, thankfully I‚Äôve sick 10 years never major illness actual fuq?!? pray health don‚Äôt deserve caught crossfire üôè  Hopefully schools help drive numbers. highschool H1N1 scare, effectively made vaccine mandatory. could get exemption, real exemption, ""I want it"". eventually sent notices requiring parents exemptions file date would vaccinated school, went it.

Oh goodness! hope friend able heal point live life normally (or normal one lung). horrible ordeal go through! Acetaminophen safe take much (it cumultative damage; threshold almost entirely non-toxic quickly shifts toxic threshold reached due enzyme cascade liver). 

Just monitor intake acetaminophen standalone drug well drugs may contain it. Taking 7 pills instead recommended 6 throughout day hurt either. make sure take 10, 12, more. way flu changes mutates actually totally different way corona it.

anyone half brain would base knowledge something important entirely amateur leaflet. blame lancet this?  question , find proper answer , vaccinated people spread covid-19 , get infected covid-19 ? time hear people saying, ""I'm young healthy, never thought would affect me!"". think idea press point could anyone. Well example fda reported j&amp;j vaccine linked rare development GBS. Even tho moderna &amp; Pfizer use completely different type vaccine, news going carryover effect too. text study. Results cohort included 174‚ÄØ568 adults tested positive SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) 1‚ÄØ133‚ÄØ848 adult controls tested negative SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). 174‚ÄØ568 adults SARS-CoV-2, 32‚ÄØ472 (18.6%) hospitalized,

So missing here? Study shows 18.6% hospitalized. Rubbish, severe effects children statisically negligible I'm sure well aware. many many dangers kids far greater covid them, incredibly rare (and possibly misleading) anecdotal stories justify enforced vaccination risk practically null. Since we're still vaccinating vaccines developed Covid Classic appeared 1 1/2 years ago, vaccines still pretty effective, think good indication rate change Covid slow enough beat global vaccination. We've given 3.5 billion doses far. think we'll get vaccinating good portion globe original vaccines, effectively reduce mutation rate even further. think might need 1 iteration update, booster Delta. booster Delta neutralize extremely effectively like original shots Covid Classic. good uptake booster, case rate (and therefore mutation rate) allow maybe years another update needed. Things going calm much more. practice, definition is: symptomatic enough trial participant notice call in, asked call felt symptoms. fine aggravating resistant 10% unvaccinated gets remaining 90% vaccinated.  Unfortunately, incentives politicians align that. Old people vote young people old people would vote someone give first shot vaccines. elite feed you? Surging increasing momentum cases total cases. something growing 50% per day adds pretty fucking quickly. 

If track UK delta variant trouble. two weeks behind UK atm. see % state delta?!?! isn‚Äôt getting virus getting vaccinated? vaccine give immune system didn‚Äôt already develop fighting real thing? young often think invincible. disease global spread global transmission, there's plenty unvaccinated people world serve hosts potentially mutating disease. map much accurate true (physician-provided) medical exemption would allow extremely small percentage keep benefits. yeah, right; likely large number people would make ""religious exemption"" spot--even create religion go it!

As matter fact, Googled ""religious exemption,"" good ol' Google's top recommendation ""religious exemption form covid vaccine."" know, 'religious freedom' pretty much trumps anything else (including public safety) country. I‚Äôm sorry hear this. hope symptoms mild. Yeah 5%. soon went back mask mandates vaccinated people. went got week later. live college town 35% people vaccinated. 1% people still wearing masks stores. Kinda forced hand meh. always use scary dark red, like blood running streets This. made choice get vaccinated, extremely large population Reddit (and elsewhere) view unvaccinated antichrist point fascinating. Sure, may stupid, think causing serious harm others (except burden healthcare).

While vaccines seem somewhat reduce chance infection/ spread, anywhere near effective might hoped regard. r/CovidPositive chock full cases entire households/ gatherings, etc, vaccinated people still caught virus and/or spread it. Meanwhile, Israel reintroduced masks vaccinated individual caught covid passed 80 (mostly vaccinated) people. 

If choice room vaccinated person without mask, unvaccinated person mask, would choose latter personal safety. goal keep disease away vulnerable, often hospitals. fewer workers get disease, fewer bring work them, fewer patients infected.

Also, Australia yet danger. may yet wave disease overwhelms hospitals various parts world. happens, need every doctor nurse get, would better die wave possible. Yea likelihood developing greatly increased due unvaccinated people Meant 49%. Typing new device I‚Äôm used keyboard yet. Kids need vaccine. Kids still get sick COVID. Kids die COVID. Kids get long term symptoms COVID. COVID mutate kids. Outbreaks schools necessitate temporarily going back remote learning schools. care education, want school person, need vaccinated. Sorry hear. That‚Äôs really rough. You‚Äôre right thing though   Lmao yea always switch percentages pure numbers scary enough, pure numbers percentages scary enough works folks, always going result large numbers people refusing vaccination. 

Not really. Delta developed would fine. Yes I‚Äôm saying mix vaccinated unvaccinated people crowded bars allows virus try new attempts infecting vaccinated people. achieves this, could spread wildly places without social distancing. Trust me, 95% vaccination rate social distancing, wouldn‚Äôt see issue. recognize people cautious.

I‚Äôm idea one argument could legitimate populations people can‚Äôt get vaccine. exception rule, always people willing abuse it. see hesitant. Explain think are. get details, know well there's small fraction people keep testing positive. test positive multiple times March June? Also, thought eventually determined cases actual ongoing low level infection, rather dead viral RNA fragments. I'm glad mild infection.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, 2017 word ""selfish"" makes sound like they're getting sort personal benefit... see anything increase total stroke events baseline. data exists hard find. 

The article also says general, aren‚Äôt normally risk stroke COVID-19 symptoms minor, risk stroke situation could low.

Of course getting bad Covid symptoms increase stroke risk someone already prone it. that's true illness.

I'm seeing anything says Covid increases stroke risk healthy people asymptomatic infections. 50 percent died fully vaccinated? sounds like comprehension problem communication problem. articles rare side effects recommend getting vaccinated? global pandemic. mock people trusting science, reasonable people rely science decide relabel ""bureaucracy?""

What mean ""reasonable people rely science""? exactly relying on? Generally speaking French need told stats people eligible, stats probably change, yeah, community protection definitely improve. Kids scare normal right now. hope cause banned European Country visiting next month. can't people get vaccinated. frustrating. Nope 5-8%? I'll take it. put us low end herd immunity.

Granted, that's aggregate. We're going dangerous pockets unvaccinated people country. anecdotal doesn‚Äôt really sway anyone. Everyone know perfectly fine now. person know severe case expected one weight Yup, UK finally given up. They're gonna breed one hell new variant. Theres plenty people insisting they're going dodge COVID goes away vaccine bad idea... many gotten COVID, either died passed on.

Its worth noting long term effects either side effect secondary infection present symptoms early continue. bogeyman people worried vaccine new symptom pops road... even COVID ""long"" COVID symptoms ""short"" symptoms persisted. think safe remove mask home six feet away anyone else. safest thing do. can't let guard yet. Given every American (and human earth speaking broadly) encouraged take vaccine, don‚Äôt think would bode well sudden say it‚Äôs safe, especially given half country ha vaccinated. Many people idea FDA approved drugs yet.

People would outraged approvals ahead people encouraged take it. What's mean? Drove Ozarks last month, masks anywhere apparently one least vaccinated parts country.

Is surprise considering 4th first holiday dropped thier guards? truly feel last surge while. 

Do know fact? course not, bet surge much holiday variant. Look statistics. one said isn‚Äôt bad. calling antivax kinda strange. don‚Äôt call people lazy get flu vaccine antivax. They‚Äôre lazy stop wearing masks? iirc john hopkins says protection like 6-8 months still decent bit could still susceptible variants, best get vaccine can.

Thank goodness daycare mandatory mask policy kids workers. Eh.. cares internet points!

Average daily case counts Wisconsin still low, creeped last week low 80 per day 140 per day. I've watching playoffs noted ever increasing people hanging around deer district Bucks made playoffs.

It interesting see numbers start rising exponentially. delta starting entrenched, could see another wave US since delta infectious. people insurance though, pocket cost would much lower I'm sure nothing, curious. anyone experienced vertigo getting vaccines? something I've never suffered before, today got diagnosed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 2 weeks 2nd Pfizer shot. People pushing idea, mean, like FDA Advisory Committee!?! frustrating. fuming listening June 10th meeting. also people say worried long term effects vaccines.  Well dont know long term effects COVID either. Even broken clock right twice day. Yeah OP thinks we‚Äôre using people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated actually it‚Äôs we‚Äôre privileged window shop vaccines choose best ones. brings back original point, really. risk stroke asymptomatic flu studied. someone goes hospital stroke, they're going given flu test, never know. 

The reason (or one them) we're seeing correlations Covid medical conditions every single person goes hospital getting tested Covid. they're going test cold flu viruses unless present symptoms, even severe high risk group (otherwise they'll tell go home rest).

Asymptomatic cold flu cases simply never discovered. data symptomatic cases.  Thought Onion headline first nsfw tag? pretty much sure thing, mean shots given. true. Unwilling making sacrifices incapable making logical, quick decisions needed win war large scale. definitely sucks. going handling problem pandemic handling like endemic.

Imagine attitude polio, etc. similar reaction first Shingles shot. Sick three days, high fever. apprehensive second put busy work, finally get it, zero side effects. So, it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôll fine second Covid shot. even do, outcomes Delta variant much better 2 shots.  really, current covid vaccines actually incredibly specific target coronavirus spike protein. ""if this, might die,"" might like answer get.

I made point last week another thread. think people willing die people certainly are. AIDS crisis gay men die rather give anal sex. seems strange identity centered around certain lifestyle seem inconceivable anything else. vaccine get? It‚Äôs virtually impossible trace transmission transit, though. So, ? Especially people know they've infected?? Especially many people ones adverse reactions? thought 64% effective preventing symptoms demotivating factor front people getting vaccinated already returned normal. celebrated Thanksgiving Christmas last year throwing big parties year. MyFiteSong said ""The vaccinated elderly almost serious breakthrough infections happening.""

Breakthrough infections expected, per CDC. counted post-vaccinated victim hospitalized, per CDC.

So vaccinated elderly still catching COVID badly enough hospitalized. exactly vaccine resistant strains happen, even mRNA vaccines. 

It's analogous MRSA, science says formed staph bacteria survived medical intervention (methicillin, staph bacteria). Coronavirus survives vaccinated immune system opportunity mutate, multiply, spread manner. point believe understand science behind diseases. I‚Äôm BC, we‚Äôve gone ‚Äúmasks recommended‚Äù (and predictably people ignore deny difference ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù ‚Äúoptional,‚Äù sigh)

People better I‚Äôd hoped we‚Äôre still half population fully vaccinated we‚Äôve kept 7-8 week wait shots, it‚Äôs like even go get second dose, it‚Äôs ‚Äúturn‚Äù yet.  analogies absolutely absurd... Vitamins? Milk? Fish oil? things completely incomparable vaccine. Also, one trying force drink Milk.

Flu shots? get em. Never flu. But, telling FDA approval actually means nothing, okay process ignored? What?

Clear liquid they're telling is... not, that's law. Also medical system heavily regulated, there's incentive someone inject random substance without knowing.

Your examples ""semantics,"" they're terrible analogies. point made ""semantics,"" logic. critical thinking. ordered lot vaccine, likely donate lot make sure go waste. government hedged bets buying everything early. Imagine Fox around polio vaccines came out. kids two colds since May. four them, kids is. Two fully vaccinated still mask, picked colds somewhere probably touching something face domino effect house. point. precautions protecting could get vaccine. can‚Äôt bring baby store us magically 100% people given store vaccinated even though states like 35%. mask mandate felt safer everyone mask ok baby young wear one. Everyone keeps acting like it‚Äôs fine unvaccinated people get Covid they‚Äôre choosing get vaccinated. It‚Äôs annoying it‚Äôs like people forget kids 12 count people. Schizophrenic literally means ""suffering schizophrenia"".  78 percent 12+ first 56% second dose. using AZ anymore Moderna Pfizer. leading world first dose quickly approaching second dose. Exactly!

Boohoo. new studies, UK slamming it‚Äôs weekly report showing effectiveness infection, you‚Äôre studying health science, know infection means spread, I‚Äôm also really quite concerned you‚Äôve ‚Äúgathered hundreds studies publications‚Äù still working data date somewhere February basing decision get get vaccine *and* confident enough make post social media confirming positive belief. aware already. information thread provided insight also. silly example; could save two healthy people resources would take save one unhealthy person seems pretty obvious you‚Äôd save two, regardless person unhealthy. think understand insurance companies work. Bro stop lmao obesity 100% preventively disease. Obesity multifactorial, genes alone doesn‚Äôt cause someone obese. 

People obese, smokers, drug addicts science deniers thousands documentations explain detrimental health based science making conscious choice continue behaviors. Literally everything said antivaxxers said others preventable diseases Uh, yes, lots studies vaccines' relative effects infection rates.

They reduce person's chance getting infected, chance spreading others, make less likely severe still get infected. Thanks! baffled, 'cause brain like 'no, that's 1/40' rest like 'I forget use calculator, never know! mwahahaha!"" due respect, may qualified comment. come recently, NSW cases showing, benefited quite bit dumb luck. first instance isolated island state lucky.
Mostly ""leaders"" shadowing USA UK decisions.  Thanks god. getting worried go another lockdown. pandemic knew young people got it‚Äôs starting increase. still denial enjoy pointing increased spread starting ripple effects county‚Äôs hospitals, caring 398 coronavirus-positive patients Monday. That‚Äôs 56% two weeks ago. two communication problems recently imo (and they‚Äôre connected makes trickier):

1. perception vaccinations don‚Äôt necessarily work potentially dangerous side effects, leading people hesitant get vaccinated noted.

2. perception getting vaccinated essentially makes invincible COVID (as think it‚Äôs pretty much 100% effective), leading people become careless altogether get vaccinated, even though still small chance still get symptoms spread others, particularly light Delta variant. 

Both perceptions extremes need sending message 1) covid pandemic still need cautious even we‚Äôre vaccinated everyone around us vaccinated, 2) vaccines work everyone get vaccinated limit transmission protect ourselves/each other. Natural selection work guess provide protection greater number people limited vaccine supply.

France similar policy since early 2021 - catch covid recover, get one shot 3-6 months later instead usual forgetting everyone get vaccinated yet (example kids) exposing individuals. Medicare denied

I'm talking specifically Medi*caid*\--Medi*care* different program.

And making apples-to-oranges comparison. comparing denial pre-existing conditions--which illegal ACA--to denial failing meet requirement (getting vaccine).

There already system place latter. denied meeting income requirements. denied failing meet asset limits. addition, denied federal/state welfare benefits failing meet employment requirements, etc. 

COVID-19 unprecedented event. government obligation citizens mitigate damage legal way possible. *could* include requiring receiving benefits get vaxxed. optics around pandemic change almost daily basis, that's part reason reluctance. point, many us care less optics; we're simply looking ways effectively raise rate vaccination. Let's honest. anti-vaxxers using negative vaccine articles justify stance. never gonna get vaccinated begin Thanks valuable input. useful us all. Thank gracing us time jeopardising beautiful fingers typing comment up. swear get November quarantine traveling again... single covid death 5 days, population 5 million.  Wow, needs seen people. Oh, let address question, maybe, maybe not. studying health science, gathered collated hundreds studies publications health nutrition, direct contact people us UK. yeah, I'd say enough least capable conversation around this. BTW I'm seeing much actual scientific conversation here. Yeah quite close, necessarily pulled ass! Thankfully heart disease cancer infectious.  obviously shedding completely fine vaccinated kids! /s  glad advising them. like people give fuck listen. live right outside chicago people laughed previous advisory go spite it. It‚Äôs sickening. American vanity finally catching itself. experts? find listen experts opportunity, saying newspaper random peeps reddit experts? I'm confused supposed insinuations Still ironic liberal would trust science believe Trump. completely unheard me.

For record, super liberal trust science got vaccine moment got chance to. They're saying Boo-urns many elderly trump voters republicans getting vaccine. people shoot foot!  readily available I'll reconsider. insight regions valuable considering Australia pretty damned lucky it. Teach me! mean people COVID-19 co morbidities. know reports young doctors example, working shift work stress getting good sleep would instantly put risk category. Yeah , gathered mind totally made up. pretty sure though, nothing write sway one way other. 

I encourage people get one vaccines covid possibilities bad outcomes contracting covid much greater getting one vaccines cost getting vaccine low. 

That reasoning used decide get vaccinated. dithered little bit getting well wanted observe outcomes first 20 million people got vaccines. closed minded despite top experts virtually every nation earth urging everyone get vaccinated, decided know better. Chile study Coronav/Sinovac Gamma/Lambda. hope Indonesia Thailand releases something Sinovac Delta. amazing access information still come conclusion odds virtually every expert field. either smartest guy room, seriously suffering dunning Kruger. well around 100 personnel carrier, number crew members four accompanying British ships also caught COVID-19. 
There 3,700 personnel across entire carrier strike group. 
100 3700? seem bad   expect 115% efficacy. want go back erase previous mistakes. terrible ideas, would suggest keeping voicing public space allows everyone else tell terrible is.

Delta strain appears hitting age groups evenly bad symptoms hospitalization.

Get vaxed. funny, articles far mainstream, gave sign them. stats prove otherwise pst... people refusing vaccine think are...  Exactly said. Zero tolerance stupidity (everything typed word tolerance)   heard now? It's... delicious! literally understand vaccines work since think could ""long-term effects""    variant ""out compete"" variants?

I think wording misleading, actually, since different virus strains never interact other. We've basically already achieved herd immunity original virus, more-or-less disappeared already ‚Äî new mutations, pandemic would probably over. is, alpha beta steep declines. delta contagious, need really high levels immunity current measures decisive stopping spread. top that, we‚Äôre still seeing 10k first doses day.

We also never truly locked first couple months. forced close restaurants spring devastating 3rd wave, part, things remained open us. Lmao good luck Wait, so?  really wish thought way earlier pandemic. Give em taste ol' medicine. I'm Ireland got vaccinated yesterday first dose Pfizer. Thank science.

Woke chills bit sore arm feel fine now. Feeling grateful right lmao want say tech decades old yet first time used widespread production setting. SARS, H1N1, Ebola Malaria vaccines developed timeframe since none use mRNA method. Either gap critical thinking intellectually dishonest.  


People right question putting bodies medicine right treatment right person right time. conceivable way anyone believe understood longterm effects vaccines vaccines even year. political party telling people vaccinate... focusing one thing worst thing. really trying make less bad is. They're psychotic fucking scary.  Interesting, FDA soon approve based data. guess know better them, huh?

And see government forcing anyone take vaccine. I'm saying they're idiots but....

Their *not finding* public health office‚Äôs official guidelines core problem.

They could still find mistrust it. Must already *that* point. I'm vaxxed moderna, others vaxxed got covid. naively thought I'd fine, 3 others got infected too. I'm wondering delta variant.

Feels bad. I'm selfishly getting free vaccine protect virus killed hundreds thousands want people get go back work... go fun again.. THAT'S selfish!... people morons want go forever seem understand world works. Authoritarian shortsightedness may contagious can't simply pay extra priority review. either:

* Apply (**like Pfizer did**) extra charge. given drug offers major advances treatment, provide treatment adequate therapy exists.
* Use Priority Review Voucher, given incentive successful drugs targeting rare pediatric diseases, tropical diseases, material threats. 15 buy cost hundred million dollars.

That's important detail mention tell someone 1/50 chance dying covid. make claim everybody young people (below 40/50) wrong statistic.

To add, death rate reliable either, ton younger people covid without symptoms. I've months ago bad all, one brother symptoms tested positive another tested negative twice symptoms.

Goes show new metric reliable. Though want convince people take vsccine risk it. Mention loss taste smell.

Basically everyone know who's covid, even without symptoms smell taste affected. Mine normal yet brother, tested negative suddenly lost taste 2 weeks supposed infection date. Still returned insurance covers test positive.

It's extremely annoying favorite food taste like stinky socks bread smelling like chlorine.

Once mention biggest problem difference influenza see consider vaccine. Ah, thank you! need change view, agree completely.

Haha, exactly, ""89% COVID cases negative"" could read many different ways.

Here want absolutely every case come forward matter small symptoms, miss links transmission chain, miss spread regions. 

The people advocating want replacement test workplaces, rate inaccuracy would harm good here.

PS - good willing change view new evidence, open mind good mind. realize ""government"" super complex system, right? Made millions workers hundreds departments.

The parts/facets/historical-inertia government ""says"" weed bad nothing parts encouraging vaccine. elderly voted mistreatment. pity.  Assuming dont take risks wouldnt vaccinated  11% false positives seem accurate. remember studies claimed ~0.2%, still lot considering amounts tests done. 0.2% means here, positive result chances actually infected like 5%. article general great, phrasing make sense also correctly identified 89% COVID cases negative.

What now, COVID case, correctly identified negative?!

""CMV"" means ""Change view"", i.e. expressing viewpoint also readiness change somebody confronts new facts false cases would complete destroy system.

At least confirm case PCR test, rapid test precursor. Still, false positives cause needless panic, false negatives (of *a lot* symptom-free people, probably 50%+ one reads) cause false sense security.

IMO case tests useful cold-like symptoms home, use tests decide COVID something else.  dad got Sputnik brother got Sinovac. mom got Pfizer, I'm worried two us much dad brother. safe vaccines? articles tell good news them? comes delta variant gotta convert metric  That‚Äôs still make even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. Kind topic, sure. comment supporting person stating 6 *possible* deaths related vaccination 184 million US received least 1 dose vaccination.  Yeah, never makes sense go raw numbers. said, there's survival rate virus infected, there's chance getting infected. Obviously, get vaccinated, chance getting vaccine 100%. think tend drastically underestimate chance getting sick (combined chance adverse consequences getting sick). This. This. This. 

For unhealthy proportion society, ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù devolved paranoia unwarranted suspicion. old school American neoconservatism right there. considered canvassing Jeb Bush? 

Healthcare human right. want healthcare even people like.  love thousands new cases cropping may even die, yet still government make vaccination mandatory. wonder elected officials think ""acceptable number deaths"" they're worried angering voters ever mandate it. still wear mask everywhere smh get downvoted oblivion Reddit saying people taking advice CDC masks many variables say every vaccinated person need mask.  primary concern whether anot vaccines protect us indefinitely. It‚Äôs one thing say let‚Äôs live it, whole lot another booster shots twice year. poorly ready since vaccines require many jabs, much less continual booster shots. 

I think hospitalisation rates look good country vaccinated people. lowest, one lowest, yes. 

They 4% obesity rate, puts one lowest rates world, much lower US  needs context cruises Singapore as, say, Florida right now. 

Cruising Singapore subject restrictions on-land activities - restrictions group sizes, masks outside rooms, social distancing. Additionally, need get swab test done board carry contact tracing Bluetooth device around boat. Finally, overall caseload Singapore pretty low (~300 active cases 5.7M population, imported) 70+% population vaccinated least one dose. 

Protocols place eventuality looks like followed T. part precautionary protocols, surprised turns form anything small cluster.

Also, already exited testing, asked monitor health tested two weeks. likely fine I‚Äôm severely ill. feel okay? Us pop around 300million vaccines need one shot. Let sink next time go grocery shopping don‚Äôt get people pissed people won‚Äôt vaccinate? don‚Äôt, might die, end story, selfish ass hats everyone complaining die‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs problem here? vindictive make feel good? makes feel gross it. mention everyone goes cruising must undergo testing first. means cruises rather safe, even occasions like this. Healthcare human right, something earn. Source? Real sources, please going get hit junk even wearing cup won‚Äôt 100% save boys get hit, you‚Äôll sure glad wearing it.  toxic political landscape brought worst people.

I would say boils this. steadily getting worse last 20 years. Exactly always going variants, going variant. Globally aren‚Äôt done yet.  4 long years trump got thinking brainloss brain power. Came say same... describes extremely liberal mom, except mom 75 overweight high blood pressure. precisely person get vaccinated first saw couple bs posts facebook decided wait. finally get it, practically hysterical completely illogical first. bachelors, masters, ed specialists degree, btw. stupidity, fear generated whatever propaganda shoved face given moment.

If living literal ruins food scarce many friends, family former neighbors dead, choice rely community. result losing much WWII, countries trended socially democratic time, enacting social safety nets soon could.

The US experienced WWII differently. GIs cam home, home left it. wouldn‚Äôt know, jobs bountiful someone rebuild Europe. US experienced unprecedented economic success never seen. lead lot families develop ‚Äúbootstraps‚Äù mentality, limited view, pull bootstraps.

So get approval booster people 6 month out, stop boosters October normal adults reach 6 month timeline? absolutely cannot vague this. specific target group. 6 month eventually cover everyone.

LMAO remember Aussies flexing us could go concerts? tables turned‚Ä¶ least Florida lots hospitals. though? important also understand UK hospitalization death data [largely] decoupled case rate though.  

If imagine vaccine makes less likely hospitalized infected, that's true, means hospitalizations grow exponentially rate cases do. Just, maybe instead 2 deaths per 100 cases, 2 deaths per 1000 cases. 

In UK seen deaths rising exponentially rate cases though. cases rising quickly ""safe"" group (young people) compared older people (a vaccinated old person still threatened virus unvacccinated young person) 

The UK definitely saved vaccine right now, vaccine stopping spread virus vulnerable groups, reduction hospitalization risk infected. 

It means might end different picture countries find older vaccinated people getting infected exponential rates. wearing cloth mask. big mistake. worn N95.  Except COVID take measures reduce risk infection, added low chance getting serious complications reduction active infections seems like better odds taking vaccine stage adverse effects yet mapped full certainty, example latest news heart complications linked Pfizer (I think?) soon show symptoms flight? Lol keep telling excuse disregard population aren‚Äôt. people gone enjoying life rn. Time move. 1) want pass others, especially children get vaccine.


2) want virus, all. Non-symptomatic not, I'm concerned long term effects could cause. Probably second dose Moderna. Anecdotally, much stronger kick Pfizer, that's stories I've heard, there's hard evidence that. people work friends/family members issue, plenty others problem. Imagine vaccine makers wait extra eight months prove efficacy putting products market. Imagine let people make choice receive safe vaccine may may effective. 1) Long term side effects vaccines don‚Äôt exist, claimed decades anti vax people. 2) reason vaccines take long approve combination red tape, lack funding volunteer requirements, safety: also wouldn‚Äôt make sense claim vaccine safer 5 years trials, effectively saying ‚Äúwell you‚Äôll fine next 5 years vaccinatef 40 years you‚Äôre own, good luck!‚Äù Vaccinated people still get contaminated might end contaminating get vaccinated.

You seem assume contaminated people refused vaccine. wrong. ex used call anecdata. People vaccinated blocks based age. group ranging 40 49 years old ""finished"" recently people 30s vaccinated now. people 40 option vaccinated, definitely choice. Oops. posted wrong response. :) scared adverse reaction terrified COVID since way likely worse symptoms. could wait population decreases incentivize smart people move there. Ah. Australia, need vaccinate young adults children NOW!!! Probably rest lives. never going eradicate covid, live it. (if easy think) change path, they'll ask vaccine anyway go training other.

In end blah blah BS like everywhere.

the difference US France e.g. Tennessee vaccine free, France choice, mandatory weither like not, health everyone prevail 'freedom, equality fraternity '. wouldnt destroy FDA's credibility rather CDC, NIH pushing EUA vaccine full approval. Mostly sick. Nobody rural area followed contact tracing quarantines. Stop count! Ya‚Ä¶.that isn‚Äôt true. welp, we're screwed here, that's sure. really really can't wait leave state. CDC estimates cases 4x higher reported US though Bit concerns potential long term effects mRNA vaccines? border sharing MO particularly bad? Two things here. One tests longer free. Second test done within two days enter wherever that‚Äôs requiring check. Someone could potentially paying multiple tests, per week, simply staying home‚Ä¶not going much in-between. 

While agree policy way believe it‚Äôs implemented early. Unlike US still supply issues availability issues everyone actually wants vaccine may able get deadline.

For family, Florida fine agree, better people die let Chinese vaccines... /s also came say thing people tell me: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve it, big deal, I‚Äôm going get vaccinated,‚Äô‚Äù said Craig McCoy, former paramedic who‚Äôs president Mercy Springfield Communities, operates hospital Springfield. ‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt realize people antibodies alpha variant sitting hospital delta important.  Ignorance ceased legitimate excuse entered information age Tennessee 38% vaccinated shares border Missouri. really want double killing citizens? I'd like see got figures. They're grossly inaccurate. 1 50 chance death? Nope. Perhaps elderly severe comorbidities. Looked questionable? That's fucking ridiculous.. obvious understand science works. make judgment calls change course time based evidence.

And look results. Vaccines work They're 'acting dumb'. That's giving *way* much credit. 'Acting dumb' try stunt impress friends hurt process. Refusing vaccine deadly disease that's caused (and still causing) pandemic last 18 straight months ridiculously far beyond 'acting dumb', think words English language powerful enough accurately describe mind-numbingly stupid malevolent truly is.  museums. Vaccines Oh lord  Imagine headlines California used Chinese vaccines... US needs get vaccine approved kids go back school month half. Parents start taking time work again, deal sick kids. Remember, hurts everybody.  Presuming you‚Äôre US there‚Äôs reason would happen vaccines readily available anyone wants them. Case count metric concerned about. Hospitalizations among vaccinated watch negligible vaccines work well.  course are!! universal healthcare system !!!  people medical reasons get notwithstanding

There none. Neither FDA CDC currently recognizes *any* medical conditions prevent vaccination. live student flat. Covid rampant here. Laziness main reason taking vaccines, also fueled conspiracy theories social media. really is, they're dumb shit think 80% yes that‚Äôs aim globally. Could firing legally considered retaliation individual fired raising alarm impending health crisis? chance.

Even that's underselling it. chance, still chance, continue chance. like woke late missed bus. bus idling outside front door waiting them. Isn‚Äôt significantly smaller pool previously-infected people vaccinated people, therefore makes sense total number cases would made significantly less previously-infected people vaccinated people (which accounts vast majority adults)? Seems like really bad statistics used here. 

Not saying previous infection doesn‚Äôt provide good immunity; almost surely does, article taking leaps leaving context opinion.  would test. longer correct.

New variants virulent devastating.

ICUs starting fill children pediatric vents short supply.  Actually key bit GP's *selecting* specific patients believed covid PCR tests. unrealistic. Given contagious Delta variant is, would probably need 90%+ vaccinated.... globally. fact COVID us forever anything really worry about. Eradicating virus completely awesome bonus happens point future. goal high enough immunity general (world) population render virus unfortunate inconvenience rather anything concerned with. gamma lambda probably.. Ya bro, AIDS organ transplants contraindicated receiving vaccine. people autoimmune conditions also safe take it. Drawing conclusion poorly-known numerator mistake. 

You number vaccine, **not** number previously infected -- unless testing entire population. 

It's like saying, people red shirts group people met someone named Greg. count red shirts, compare fraught. Sure, there's famine happening, rather eat one last feast simply die? Eating preserved vegetables salt-cured pork keep alive survival *really living*?? They‚Äôre getting vaccinated hard way.

Covid really made hate people general. mostly shits. needs different method science communication, clearly calling people ‚Äúenormously selfish‚Äù isn‚Äôt meaningfully impacting vaccination rates. People need address root cause vaccine hesitation, almost certainly less selfishness, actual fears regarding vaccine. understand that, communicate science you‚Äôre harm good. Grrr, annoying!! Except bunch variants they‚Äôre cooking end affecting us actually cared‚Ä¶ said ""affected"" meant serious illness death. Gonna add word. Yes, ridiculously significant reductions serious symptoms death. Showing vaccine works. Also, people get vaccine, effective preventing spread. It‚Äôs different spreading virus vaccinated person unvaccinated person compared two vaccinated people.  According uncle, Spanish airports put sweeping stick tip nose, COVID test joke. possibly keep positive cases artificially low(er). long covid part least understood probably scariest comes age groups otherwise low risk ""bad"" outcomes.

""masks protect others"" nonsense outdated information WHO/CDC incorrectly stated early pandemic. Huge benefit, getting vaccine owns libs Trump got like 25% LA county 2020. got 1 million votes Unvaccinated people need understand still catch covid even rely others get vaccinated protect them. Sorry genuine question im ootl this: title misleading then? vaccines prevent infection, ""enormously selfish unvaccinated"" fueled cases surge? Wanted share one encouraging data points I've seen pandemic.

Scotland's 7-day average cases peaked 2 weeks ago, probably going see peak hospitalizations/deaths within next week so. results?

**Current Metrics:**

Peak 7-day average cases = 3,334 (on 6/30)

Latest 7-day average hospital admissions = 70 (as 7/7, may somewhat increase) 2.1% confirmed peak cases

Latest 7-day average deaths = 2 (as 7/12) 0.1% confirmed peak cases


**January Wave Metrics:**

Peak 7-day average cases = 2,356 (on 1/1)

Peak 7-day average hospital admissions = 196 (on 1/14) 8.3% confirmed peak cases

Peak 7-day average deaths = 63 (on 1/23) 2.7% confirmed cases

This suggests DRAMATIC reductions severity disease 75% hospitalization death. Additionally, Scotland's vaccination rate high (~90% adults least one dose), obviously still unvaccinated many partially vaccinated people data set. Thus, reduction severity vaccinated folks almost certainly even better.

These vaccines work great folks! Go get shot yet.

Edit: fixed formatting It‚Äôs disgusting US treat elderly. whole pandemic illuminated gross society is. say lot society treats elderly, sick, underserved US fails miserably.  mutates creates new variants last days, S√£o Paulo (Brazilian state located southwest region country) announced vaccinate people aged 12+ starting next month August 23.

As July 14, start vaccinating first people preexisting comorbidities August 23, move people aged 15+ September 6 12+ September 20, without comorbidities last two groups.

If everything goes well, expected Brazilian states start vaccinating people aged 12+ sometime soon!

I'm happy announcement, thought going vaccinated end year 2022 1/4 people getting infected fully vaccinated, hardly ‚Äòtiny number‚Äô thing really, next suggest send Gulag. frustrating thing constantly hear healthcare sector making f*cking killing COVID. Even are, absolutely interest debating, narrative simply fueling ""I'll show them!"" crowd. penny every time heard elderly person numbers made hospitals get sweet sweet government money vaccinations performed. Sure goes ways, know extent leans one way other. I'm vaccinated btw, pet peeve statistics used tell fraction story. auths charge know that. Historically, intellectual leaders get, um, handled. Look dissidents China USSR handled. Treat dissident thoughts mental illness and, well‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs equally selfish demand take sake someone else. one unlucky experienced adverse reaction?

I don‚Äôt know enough vaccine want take it, especially I‚Äôm likely danger Covid-19.

Mutations happening regardless poorer parts world never reach 100% vaccination, like we‚Äôve already seen mutations coming Brasil, India, South Africa etc. Morons vaccinate morons point. I'm dude. Let morons die increase average IQ. 

""We need new plague"". There‚Äôs also reason conditions necessary complete FDA approval. Emergency Use Authorization fine don‚Äôt act like people ridiculous putting much faith would put actual approval. 

Also don‚Äôt act like people ridiculous hesitant, whatever reason. Even believe they‚Äôre ridiculous, acting like it‚Äîtreating such‚Äîis terrible way convince stop hesitating. It‚Äôs much likely cause dig heels. Obesity kills smoking alcohol, yea, unless want able evaluate eat charge less based diet aspect health, allowed charge deny coverage reason hope sinks Florida does.  Yep. It‚Äôs people lack emotional coping accountability. nailed it. use big pharma lobbying FDA approval excuse. Companies lobbying government organisations various benefits valid issue across world raise new excuse fully approved. Sounds like snl skit? wait long vaccinate kids again?  Sat mother hesitant explained vaccines detail. We‚Äôre heading week get first shot.  get hoarse, coughing. Close enough ?  I'm dense. know safe effective masses. Read edit, that's bullshit FDA would maybe find reason appear vaccines long term. politics business point. statement holds true overall. drug companies FDA barrel right now. never would approve mRNA vaccine before. Industry showed great covid vaccine need approve keep face despite never establish predicate. Source? return work next week. Guess I'm bringing masks air filter ... also sneaking suspicion COVID significantly impacted children would different tune. 

It‚Äôs fucked. US least used American spirit everyone came together time crisis.

Every vaccine demonstrate effectiveness safety via double blind study FDA granted emergency authorization. 

They testing vaccines general also traveled lot within EU past spring needed provide proof negative test. countries specifically required PCR. get expensive.  Ah yes, opinion piece. bastion unbiased reading üôÑ

That opinion piece gets several facts wrong. mRNA platform vaccines available vaccines, even were, unknown novel platforms. mRNA vaccine technology researched 30 years. mRNA ""gene based"" vaccine claim either. Further, fail identify risks mRNA vaccines 0-16 population acknowledging death rate 20 1,000,000 among children ages 0-17. comment claim zero children suffering long term COVID symptoms, flat false. 

Lets look actual facts here: child likely die COVID-19 die COVID-19 vaccine. child likely become severely ill COVID-19 COVID-19 vaccine. child hasnt gotten COVID-19 vaccine likely put someone cant get vaccine risk. child hasnt gotten COVID-19 vaccine likely become breeding ground next variant concern. 

Public safety requires participation public. child willing participate keeping public safe, wont lose second sleep saying business participating public life. vaccines full approval require schools, allow children attend person vaccinated valid health/religious exemption, simply choose get vaccinated find alternative place get educated participate remote learning. year two stomped thing out, thanks them, rejoin rest civilized society. 1 540 people USA died Covid Thanks expressing idiotic options things considered, that's progress. going two steps forward one step back while.

I'm sure higher chance happening covid long hauler getting vaccinated. Pretty much. 21 percent population got first doses last 4 weeks. last week accounts less 3%. case numbers picking again, may change soon. latest saw 6 months Pfizer vaccine still maintained roughly 90% efficacy.

Like, that's deep goes. believe much putting kids danger. Nuts. guess so, yeah. sucks.

We still mitigate damage, though. delta-specific booster could help, one example. fully vaccinated hopefully son antibodies. Considering ChickenPox/Shingles interaction, concerned long term effects entirely reasonable.

What makes current situation sad people ""time left"" (those 12) also ones unable vaccinated, also vulnerable (arbitrarily put large unvaccinated group interactions).  Unless thousand year longitudinal study good enough. Yeah know OD Pandemic became increasingly alarmed amount booze saw people's carts grocery stores. people alcohol food. alarming observation. kept thinking: ok, America handling lockdown/the Pandemic. That's fine since, unlike developing vaccine, promoting new rap album require medical degree.   Surprised government isn‚Äôt more. quiet not? France minimal pushback think could expect see it. can't accept vaccination numbers currently are. something.  it‚Äôs Americans forum. Can‚Äôt take freedoms Like not, won‚Äôt end virus can‚Äôt continue spread. virus won‚Äôt stop spreading kills every idiot refuses stop spreading it. That‚Äôs are, everyone won‚Äôt wear mask get vaccinated, alternative need get gone. child wasnt born yet 2019. assuming lot situation comment. lot. Much love household. So, facts propaganda now? Scary heard country called India, maybe read happened young unvaccinated people good health. yes deadly, time better research.  said people Canada well. don‚Äôt think antivax uniquely American invention, Americans probably seem louder large population tend seen ‚Äúworld leader‚Äù. I‚Äôm means trump fan never antivax either. walked really strange line regular people antivax people publicly bragging quickly got vaccines also really encouraging anyone take them. trying somehow appeal odd. understand sentiment (My family vaccinated FWIW) BUT... non vaccinated folks enabling virus stick around (and potentially mutate further) extending pandemic. 

This puts us risk, especially young kids (who eligible vaccine) immuno compromised, increased likelihood getting sick, hospitalized even dying. nurse believes science betterment health. nurse believes utilizing critical thinking skills often results seeing sense treating illnesses medication, instead letting nature take (often disastrous) course.

Of course, I'm retired, perhaps basing philosophy science critical thinking old-fashioned. /s give lot drugs... system design put bandage wound never really treat roots problem. go mental physical health.

I developed Plantar Fasciitis jogging, co worker got too. us wen dr treatments follow: Ball roll, foot brace, gets bad go get shot... temporary put pain away, it'll come back. kind treatment this?

When real treatment spend 10 minutes per session 2-3X day stretching calf muscle tight, stop pulling foot tendons... completely solve problem caused first place.

Same thing allergies, mental issues, ect... know people anxiety get drug time. real problem caused anxiety, fix it'll gone, instead hopping drug daily.

It's scary dr us. One best friends died last month probable fentanyl. It‚Äôs heavy loss. wasn‚Äôt even 30 yet.  Midwest exactly? Upper Midwest (IL, MN, WI) fine vaccinations. Regardless whether posted true way address comment responding to. government entity pays overall people would get sued vaccine makers. understand why, matter public health want dissuade people getting vaxed due lawsuits, program used antivaxxers justification believing conspiracy theories vax. no-win. willing take risk get vax. headache five days arm still brief twinge then. there's booster, I'm getting it.  already saying this, seems fundamental lack understanding part approval process ""rushed"" (it research beaurocratic nonsense).

Which, ironically, precisely party says want. less regulation businesses less one core values republicans?

Well, Pfizer Moderna two businesses, given less regulation. rejoicing? term art looking ""Correlates Protection"" - look papers &amp; articles mentioning phrase.  instance: ""A correlate protection SARS-CoV-2 vaccines urgently needed"", generally used tell whole story easy/economical test for.  B cells take work test. Watch antivaxxers get vaccine finally gets FDA approval. Bet they‚Äôll come conspiracy theory parents likely die car crash way airport get COVID flight. really depends travelling. little spread linked public transit compared settings. would tend agree principle, personal experience vaccine similar.

Full disclosure: never diagnosed covid cases time (early Feb 2020) thought exceedingly rare live, widespread testing wasn‚Äôt available - known exposure. know community several months beforehand. 100% sure covid, experience mimicked long covid patients closely.

Me: Mid 30‚Äôs, M, BMI normal range, co-morbidities.

Symptoms acute onset respiratory issues got worse 3-4 days, random blood pressure spikes even inactivity, chest discomfort, persistent fatigue. Symptoms would ebb flow, several months even felt comfortable going walk short run. constantly felt like taking short, shallow breaths deeper breathing felt uncomfortable. summer fall things slowly improved, never got back 100%, would periodically experience shallow breathing episodes persistent fatigue.

May 25 received first dose. noticed marked difference energy levels almost breathing difficulty since then. periodically find adopting shallow breathing pattern, perhaps habit, self correct trouble.

It‚Äôs entirely possible never covid, improvement either placebo effect completely unrelated 
to vaccine. Either way, it‚Äôs nice feeling human again. Huh, guess never associated level side effects see vaccines taken past. said, also never reaction speak that's poor indicator. Here's study control sample 20,000 study participants tested positive COVID-19 26 April 2020 6 March 2021, 13.7% continued experience symptoms least 12 weeks. eight times higher control group participants unlikely COVID-19, suggesting prevalence ongoing symptoms following coronavirus infection higher general asking correlates immunity. ongoing field research. Currently CDC recommend antibody testing measure immunity results difficult interpret standardized across test methods. Look dates articles.

Also, chinese embassy website part europe outdated year, mean china recognizing vaccines whatsoever   Blood hands I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs isolating infuriating. mentioned moving sadly reality super regional. People largely given masking live also least county vaccinated. day care used go specifically markets whole staff vaxxed. close, you‚Äôve got people standing shoulder shoulder prolonged periods, passing others closely platforms stairs afterwards. manufactured companies cut corners, rushed pressured others... Where's science?

Science research statistics facts product development.

Science shunning, belittling laughing others skeptical forcing submit.

That's everyone somehow forgets everyone else's rights reason live choose live.

This science mass produced product without guarantee makers held accountable defects desire make profit.

The government never 100% reliable, neither major corporations. People suddenly feel like messiah vaccine guarantee anything.

If wanted work, make healthcare universal, free non biased information everyone.

If got covid built antibodies.... never affected it.... others force people submit?

I'm anti vax, pushing anything people force going win unabated. No. person schooling HEPA filters ventilation instead masks.

Masks become talisman. Tribal thinking taken nearly everyone. Critical thinking evidence gets downvoted here. Regardless vaccine issue stupidest thing ever factually correct? Pfizer one developing fyi. biontech. ???

The inverse happening, **un**vaccinated discriminated place. claiming conspiracy, look France. vaccines similar side effects, thing usually kids get notice much.

Getting symptoms means body recognized making antibodies country high vaccination rate, high vaccine availability, basically definition.

So, tell they‚Äôre fucked? Selfish people refuse? Tiny minority unable take them? Can‚Äôt call unprotected thin sliver ‚Äúslightly fucked‚Äù metric.  PS: winter cold southern Brazil. snow days ago cities. Why? mean why? serves absolutely purpose. Vietnam logged 829 COVID-19 new cases, including 823 domestic ones, 12.30pm 6.30pm July 14, according Ministry Vietnam reported total 2,934 cases, including 2,924 domestic infections, day. them, 2,509 cases detected quarantine locked areas.

I understand difference *cases* *new cases*. today's *new case* become tomorrow's *case*? stop case? fear deterioration mental health, coupled proliferation Fentanyl coming Southern border combine make 2021 much worse even 2020.

COVID situation America? everyone vaccinated yet? months ago saw vaccinating rate millions per day. I‚Äôm curious. exceptions all, it‚Äôs illegal charge patients vaccine way. public health-wise something clearly hurting lots people, imperfect data know ifnitnis hurting g 5% 25% infected people, better data long time?  she‚Äôs describing sterilizing immunity - virus comes in, gets noticed, destroyed. Breakthrough infections person actively replicating virus becomes ill, that‚Äôs completely different. 

That‚Äôs right now, comment Twitter MD Atlantic article without actual study‚Ä¶ Long covid ruins lives. Death hospitalization metric judging pandemic. Everyone‚Äôs goal shouldn‚Äôt avoid death avoid illness becoming chronically ill change everything live. going get influx disabled country deal whole. matter wonder stay lockdown till December vaccinations supposed done. guy goddamn moron. Great job Florida. coming back anytime soon even though family shithole state. meet somewhere else on. I‚Äôm you. saying done taking extra steps protect take steps protect themselves.

If I‚Äôm going indoors around group children (hasn‚Äôt happened yet pandemic), I‚Äôll wear mask. schoolteacher, example, worked maybe toy store something. 

I don‚Äôt wear masks around adults. low chance asymptomatic COVID, *and* I‚Äôm producing enough viral shed infect adult, *and* adult unvaccinated *and* adult catches COVID *and* adult spreads kid *and* kid gets sick and/or dies?

Honestly, conscience clean. didn‚Äôt kill kid, unvaccinated parent did.

Whether kid catches COVID is, largely, responsibility parents guardians. parents aren‚Äôt vaccinated, kid‚Äôs illness is, entirely unequivocally, fault. cost would make anxiety worse... Human behavior certainly huge part problem. It‚Äôs tough convince people give personal plans ‚Äúin name saving lives others.‚Äù world already selfish. pandemic revealed more. countries, like Italy. We're still vaccinating full speed, 550k doses/day less 5M doses left stock yesterday. moment they're mostly wave second doses, lot people still waiting first waiting while.  
It's unfair penalize people situation control.

I guess would good thing countries like Romania struggling lot people wanting vaccines, time much doubt bar rural Romanian village would actually enforce rule. I‚Äôm sorry. year brutal don‚Äôt know downvotes, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre seriously asking question. answer, probably less likely side. better people 60..

The death rate 60 certainly lower. vaccine's contribution compared already lower death rate younger people clear without study though. TIL Olympics week away. Thanks correcting. edited post. coercion. Dont talk plague rats.

They dont want learn want hate.

Ignore die. Probably caught COVID flight. Fuck whole lot redditors gonna salty DeSantis becomes POTUS 2024 Luckily, vaccine works well anywhere else cafes. misread say vacation cured CoVid lol  least 19,223 people lost lives due gun violence 2020. That's almost 25% jump year before.

To think gun related homicides still increasing already set records halfway 2021. 

Many still claim records we're seeing they're comparing year year, believing 2020 record low year homicides everyone stayed home. believe we've significantly started rolling vaccines within past 6 months. also eagerly await data. 34K votes last time running closeted bisexual black guy alcoholic lol whole family still wearing masks indoor settings, even they're longer required. Especially schools. still live one shithole states suggest start looking work reality. people surprised went first restaurant (last month) since March 2020. baffles me! [Uk first vaccinate using pfizer (dec 8) according article end December they're expecting 4m saw article pertaining ""failed deal pfizer"" states succeed Philippines 10m doses January. bunch delusionals, absurd PH, developing country line 1st worlds advanced mean insensitive way, could stimulus cheques factor rise?

I could see people throes addiction/withdrawal use large lump-sum get fix, spiralling control.

I'm judging - wonder whether could partially explain increase. Agreee, many variables include study. science-believer Alabama, let's please wait eight year old vaccinated. Great article, thanks posting. Hard imagine higher quality information. Please consult doctor. cannot provide medical advice. funny everyone wants think worst US developed best vaccines giving away many millions them. website built US company probably using US companies phone type message. Sure, limited data set absolutely meaningless ability draw larger conclusions. Doubtful. Unfortunately, even big western blocks could develop common standard proof-of-vaccination within last year, let alone digital solution. EU barely got there, interoperability USA pain long time. Keep mind though 50 deaths vaccinated population vs deaths partially unvaccinated death rate amongst fully vaccinated lot less amongst unvaccinated. believe \~90+% reduction death. Better data absolutely expected time goes on. 

Second point doesn‚Äôt make sense accurately describing rate long term covid symptoms occur nothing ‚Äúpretending like long covid doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù. I‚Äôd interested studies know post vaccine measure reduction long term symptoms. u/BobbleHeadBryant discussing.

There‚Äôs evidence long lasting symptoms happened I‚Äôm seeing evidence extent they‚Äôre reduced post vaccine. Happy read studies you‚Äôve found. Thanks! will. Well sure potential that, likely won‚Äôt. 

And strong disagree making claims like that. idea like 4 years. Making silly claims like irresponsible. corona ends globally within 3 years? Nearly every US state either 10/100,000 reproduction number 1.1 higher (indicating rapid growth). I'd qualify ""very high"", especially considering many people vaccinated. See Angela Rasmussen's commentary:

""If vaccinated person exposed &amp; infected, rapid immune response prevent virus replication taking spreading neighboring cells. means productive infection, shedding &amp; spreading, aberrant host response infection, &amp; likely long COVID.""

There nothing suggest mild breakthrough cases lead ""long covid"" post viral syndrome. That's meant great job. Complacency meant prioritise vaccines. Australia still less restrictions many countries high vaccination rates.

Feeling sorry you. active pro vax find dozen family like mother classic woke person received God revelation vaccine Facebook 2am.....

They pretty difficult talk with. conclusion study.

Getting Covid effective preventing reinfection Covid vaccine. means need get Covid increase chances getting Covid. 

Which begs question. looking anyway? spend money get people get vaccine. Nice thinking maybe government make vaccination mandatory like France? vaccinated cant get restaurants, cafes, etc. reduction severity‚Ä¶. issue reduction severity long run. Since mild/moderate cases prevalence symptoms lasting many months (link earlier comment) effect vaccine cases majority breakthrough infections vaccinated health workers mild

In population, would true even without vaccines. Huh, thought past spring 4th wave, 5th. consider spring/summer 2020 wave? Yeah far robust data reporting systems. anybody really think Nigeria India keeps track 90% cases? course be, although age group always votes most? think will, looking really bad right now. got like 2-3 news friend's parents passing away today. wish could done last week could get 2nd shot last week already instead waiting till week tomorrow  Case rates many places US high people taking precautions.

Where? Averages still handful per 100k per day 9:2 13:2 ""incredibly rare"", even taking account Bay Area's high vaccinated rate.

Rather, ""vaccines help lot lot innocent fully-vaccinated people still going get really sick COVID spreads bunch"" *Dons safety goggles* Full title study: ""Study National Vaccination Campaign's Effectiveness Reducing Mortality Covid-19 **in people aged 60 over**."" continuously use data sets vaccinations prevalent prove whatever point trying make? see sentiment lot - exactly feel like now? Like think goes NYC w/ 64% vaccinated high seroprevalence non vaccinated population given hard hit? Yeap that's right also :) Im vaxxed im continuing wear mine kids bit relaxed. always wore mask hospitals pandemic anyways usually place. NOW, might choose wear one work know someone sick lol say could risky? why? Everything I‚Äôve heard said it‚Äôs fine essentially same. Yet something strong track record lasting illness (unlike common coronaviruses) that‚Äôs supposed ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù answer.

It‚Äôs great people aren‚Äôt dying often, don‚Äôt get wrong. We‚Äôre moving right direction. I‚Äôll curious see vaccines effect long term symptoms frequency become infected full vaccination. wait Super Bowl surge!!  Exactly. scumbags quietly ""Bad Thing"" shadows, decrying publically. Well shyt, chinese government trying kill weaken enemies past 20 years, slowly pushing taking territory theirs. yeah, let's stick arms people trust inject us.

But yeah, let's trust keep buying phones made child labor camps. feel good yourself. sister ICU nurse large US city. They‚Äôve fully vaxxed ICU patients Covid. organ transplants oddly enough immunosuppressants. population apparently susceptible. certainly don‚Äôt think vaccines full-proof they‚Äôre 100% worth it. it‚Äôs frustrating still feel anxious kids even fully vaxxed. feels like anxiety never end. Can‚Äôt wait covididiots shift goal posts vaccines receive FDA approval. Additionally find funny non-US people use excuse.  ""This cohort study based representative, population-based sample..."" 
"" Symptoms present diagnosis 89% participants 19% initially hospitalized...""

 
It seems strange supposedly representative sample 19% hospitalized. Covid not, point people oddly cavalier since always, especially children. Germany bit subdued regard people frown whomever goes sick, case everywhere. 
My point/fear definitely see people sick Delta, going claiming ""it's sniffles, like COVID!!!"" actually spreading Covid. want go apocalyptic, unless people get bit serious, get hairy, someone get sick loved ones come regret it. No, won't. lawmakers stopping fully vaccinated, families. prospect death isn‚Äôt funny man countries flooding sub flex America. American knew eternal lockdowns sustainable. Australia get shots arms. That's correct. flawed data. Unfortunately, flawed data regarding long covid. ""flawed"" info get keeps saying similar things, certain be. 

Here's another study shows similar would love see something better controlled. ideas measure objectively? Yeah, sounds good paper. Moderna, Pfizer, Janssen coming soon. Currently government subsidized vaccines AZ Sinovac. Sinopharm costs money currently available organizations made available public soon. Unfortunately lot people choose wait Moderna come limited quantities starting October. Moderna even expensive Sinopharm people choose wait Moderna bad mouthing current choices. people really hesitant get free vaccines even though daily cases around 9000.

Incidentally helped company register Sinopharm prepare employees jabs next week. Feels good help out. Same. want drop enough f bombs turn Reddit irradiated wasteland garbage. graph seem shifted least time, pos note UK (ahead US delta) reporting 0.2% CFR compared 1.5-2% original strain. Damn brought receipts Towing Orange Line think would extremely difficult track every symptomatic infection. accounts vaccinated people become symptomatic, would never even get tested first place symptoms minor.

It would nice sure, end day evidence shows symptomatic breakthrough infections rare incredibly mild. Apart delta variant 50 according UK government stats people taken age bracket **more likely** die Approx 25% cases result long covid. likely many people issues asymptomatic covid never knew had. covid covid kids: much still unknown virus, exactly risking kids zero protection. He's worse idiot. knows _exactly_ he's that's taking advantage actual idiots. Stop hoping, scumbags stopping vaccinations families fully vaccinated, great health coverage. I'm seeing community- Good call! False negatives head- adjusted earlier post! *want* anyone die, I'm past point caring stupid.

Exactly. Every premature death tragedy I‚Äôm sorry them. 

I don‚Äôt know drives decision. Maybe education system failed them. Maybe anxiety disorder. don‚Äôt know.

In case, it‚Äôs drive pandemic. vaccinations I‚Äôm unlikely infected transmit it. won‚Äôt continue radically adapt behavior even reduce already small risk originating me. fix. 

At current time, see new developments, consider pandemic myself.  Half sub said 6 months ago. canned response every complaint lockdowns. Darwinism, Republican edition type mask? Surprised hear n95 above. told tourism would completely dead Oceania 2027. likely this?  Delta!!!  Definitely crazy hindsight really jar time. young stupid shook, makes sense. remember parents freaked fuck concerned. happened now, assure I'd properly scared. prob got vaccine tho Long covid covid kids: much still unknown virus, exactly risking kids zero protection. Damn! Think generous 34 year old thing. surprised 12 year old trolls. news Pfizer/Moderna vaccines link myocardial inflammation?  good idea. coworkers vaccinated someone tested positive 8th, week stopped wearing masks inside around other. we're back wearing masks. Reinfections infections following vaccination happen like four common cold coronaviruses. important thing people rarely ending hospital dying COVID-19. Vaccinated people get symptoms die. know hospitalization numbers people becoming symptomatic.

The reason it‚Äôs important Covid solid track record lasting illness. vaccine helps probably *probably* it‚Äôs really concerning we‚Äôre tracking level‚Ä¶ including CDC who‚Äôs tracking hospitalizations feels like scifi movies start. guessing extemely unlikely dangerous mutation occur large number people stupidly small chances may occur.

They do, discussing false positives. Found idiot needs mainstream media herd mentality thinking/research them. Trump love either. hilarious watch schism part religious group kept food drinks front wear masks whole flight. reached cruising altitude, served drinks snacks. People, especially religious group ate really ""slow"" spent majority 1.5-hour flight without masks. also help old Embraer aircraft recycling shitty air without much filtering. People gotten smart mask rules. keep food drink front wear masks. 2-3 stewardesses flight probably want bothered arguing specifically one group. lady husband behind coughing storm too--without masks choked peanuts. Pretty shitty flight overall. Good point. I‚Äôm definitely still vaccine! Covid Day 3/4 symptoms feels exactly like cold. Annoying, still taking care kids. vaccine makes feel like normal cold that‚Äôs definitely good thing! proper research, would know mRNA vaccines actually safer vaccine come it.

They contain virus snippet RNA surrounded lipids (fat) get cells, cells copy mRNA. allows body quickly recognise virus snippet RNA. get vaccine anyway still catch spread variants, whereas vaccine work unless snippet changed. snippet chosen part unlikely change.

The vaccines authorisation use, standard procedure fully 'FDA approved' later. take much research find either.

Do measles vaccine? 
""Most people survive measles, though cases, complications may occur. 1 4 individuals hospitalized 1‚Äì2 1000 die."" necessarily death rate, hospitalisation rate paired exponential growth (High R rate) long incubation / asymptomatic cases danger. Left unchecked spread fast overwhelm hospitals everyone even needs oxygen dies.

Critical thinking hearing someone saying 'they lying you' believing unless research info side try get informed opinion.

Or another way putting 'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence'. Hearing someone's claims choosing believe looking people making similar claims, cut it.

I inherent mistrust pharmaceutical industry (They done shit sure), 'proper' research.  Literature reviews also called meta analysis perfectly valid. It‚Äôs essentially peer review process stacking published material next one another peer reviewing context. 

I would hope improved however article 2021 still shows significant false negatives. mean end day I‚Äôd want same, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd skip second dose couldn‚Äôt. might caught eyes since Covid entrance mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth). feel like ancedotes vaccines people catching causing panic really shouldn't. 

Vaccines prevent 80-90% infections. Case rates many places US high people taking precautions. Nearly everyone exposed virus Case rates high. means 10-20% people infected. That's ton breakthroughs aggregate personal safety still great. vaccines also prevent 95% hospitalizations. means yes see fully vaccinated people ER. Tea tree smells like really strong burning rubber least contract it. Thailand bought Sinovac Sinopharm? countries see usually buy one them. know Thailand producing AZ locally (hundreds millions doses production planned think). outsider's perspective, Thailand's vaccine supply seems pretty good? buy every type produce locally. flags popping ‚Äò24 inspiring new trains clog traffic. one Party US. see D3mocratic states declaring war vaccines.

Fuck auto-mod. helps Party trying drag us back stone age.  haven‚Äôt approved yet... they‚Äôre hesitant approve things long term studies. know countries vaccines prevent 80-90% infections. vaccinated people living like 2019 expect nearly exposed virus eventually. means 10-20% catch it. That's ton breakthrough cases, even vaccine works. they‚Äôre 1 3. They‚Äôre Day 3/4 symptoms seem almost 100%. slight coughs now. They‚Äôre currently running around speak. symptoms exactly trajectory every cold they‚Äôve ever had, even less ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. guess probably cold? No. areas seeing big upticks cases areas low vaccination rates. Yes, people CANNOT get it. That‚Äôs herd immunity trying help protect. Someone selfishly getting vaccinated they‚Äôve decided trust scientists infuriating. Could side effects? Sure. Nothing ever 100% effective. risk side effects vaccinations still much lower risk issues virus subsequent disease. one said ever, masks addition measures (which never happened) new variants spread easier.   I'm saying wrong 27 people catching everyone wearing masks highly unlikely, .01% situation. people wear masks planes supposed planes safe.  don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre probably assuming. Covid enters mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth). Mask may reduce risk via mouth nose eyes still exposed. First all, aint proven. mRNA uses efficacy calculations covid variants deliberate.

Second all, western media saying saying. downright coldwar lying saying sinovac doesnt work.

Which proven fail mention Sinopharm Chinese mRNA vaccines China has. deliberately target sinovac deliberately lie doesnt work. constantly obsess highlighting countries using sinovac distorting math.

Dont even frikkin lie this. Yes, leave permanently. Nobody besides China, Italy Spain... Also known heavily hit countries number 1, 2, 3 start. Hindsight 20/20, tell top.

I've read, inhaled aerosols far main source infection. Ventilation, ventilation, ventilation.  indication virus isn‚Äôt deadly unvaccinated people. death rates due vaccinated people give rise inaccurate deductions danger level delta variant.

Data clear unvaccinated people effected badly even worse previous variants. can't coordinate countries, country could close international travel lockdown two weeks. Uk roughly cases Dec. 23, current hospitalizations 75% deaths 93% first time older generations making younger generations pay mistakes. anyone success getting 12 year old vaccinated? I'm ready break rules saves kid's livelihood. I'm also high risk. know breakthrough infections happening best could symptoms, pass something on. worst could someone got seriously sick even though I'm fully vaccinated due way Covid became Alpha, Delta, Delta+, Gamma there's Lambda.

I went local shop yesterday one still wearing mask. Honestly, kind creeped out. lot we‚Äôre national parks/outdoors related still get food stuff like that. Without knowing absolute numbers, deaths statistic might actually tell us much. example, something like 80% people 65+ fully vaccinated (no clue actual number is, example), 90% deaths 65%+ group, 83% deaths would would among 20% 65+ population vaccinated. think could really show efficacy vaccine, deaths would much much higher without much population vaccinated.

It also shows though need keep getting people vaccinated keep incentivizing that, even though they're effective, bulletproof. 93% deaths vaccinated, there's good chance passed virus many people deaths would lot lower. Opiates really belong legalization conversation marijuana psylosybin. People would still become addicted die large numbers prohibition lifted without massive public education addiction treatment effort. would guess states drastically cut back testing. also lie. Delta 60% transmissible nothing proven shows behaves different past strains virus regards age. Statistically, younger people making larger percentage new infections older population vaccinated. mean anything changed virus behaves younger people compared groups. Younger kids still unlikely become extremely ill die infected. 

Spreading kind misinformation bad saying toddler 100% immune. dilutes real facts confuses people contributes people deciding don‚Äôt information need get shot. want spread real fact, stick many adults remaining unvaccinated could result new variant evolving actually much harmful young kids.  self-select bias though isn‚Äôt it? tells us people vaccinated get sick...which already knew. vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective. subreddit specifically people get COVID a) attract people vaccinated, since I‚Äôm sure many vaccine hesitant people use Reddit first place, b) attract people vaccinated it‚Äôs likely people vaxxed covid want tell someone unique circumstances.

Does make sense worrying covid vaccinated vs. worrying things much higher chance killing you? That's kind mentality created disinformation subs like NNN best numbers have, one study basically show significant problem.

Yes, final variant flawed, thinking that's flawed however. merely convenient way wording point.

I'll take next round vaccines see what's going on. come indirect direct contact small handful people, wear mask I'm out.

Just someone see point vaccination, mean care, necessarily vector infection. confirmed, it'd first ever case detected cruise ship Singapore. People think safe, good reason - there's strong contact tracing, high vaccination rates, regular testing agree - part resistance vaccines historically medical community hasn‚Äôt always gotten right awful side effects. There‚Äôs also attitude us kinds things like, oh people stupid getting vaccinated! doesn‚Äôt exactly encourage people hear science, it‚Äôs
More likely people defensive dig position. 

It‚Äôs also bizarre yet unsurprising mix whole body/my choice argument tying healthcare coverage. Although there‚Äôs different kind level public health dimension covid vaccines family planning. bounty religion bed politics.  neither think make informed decisions FYI. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs entirely true. think people consciously decide prefer take risk knowing could them.

Every time board plane understand could one million (figuratively speaking, think it‚Äôs much less reality) dies crash. It‚Äôs believe can‚Äôt happen me. It‚Äôs risk within I‚Äôm willing tolerate.

Yes, people naive think ¬´¬†it happens others¬†¬ª, genuinely think people less risk averse others understand dangers Covid willing live them. friend like that. Initially tried reason her, kept berating calling incredibly stupid selfish going get covid risk death spread others kill them. Eventually got vaccine.

Your mileage vary depending relative, say, directly constantly insulting person vaccination quite satisfying myself.  ""Covid survival rate high 90's, I'm afraid it.""

*A cases side effects millions doses*

""Fuck I'm getting vaccine, it'll kill me!"" handful? Significantly people experiencing long covid died, far know. infected Covid19, teach immune system recognize fight mutations. That's warned Delta variant. Moderna Pfizer offer protection Delta. vaccinated, please wear mask, keep distance others. Eventually, need booster shots protect new mutations/variants. vaccine still let's catch covid

This false, basically. MRNA vaccines prevent delta infections around 90%. That's equivalent everyone wearing n95 cotton mask day every day, free. Even still want wear mask due constant exposure like HCW, no-brainwer.

For catch covid, vaccines reduce contagiousness prevent severe outcomes another smaller factor - least 50%. That‚Äôs pretty damn slippery slope buddy. Opening door insurance agencies deny coverage smokers, obese people, drug addicts, type 2 diabetic etc. MANY diseases caused poor personal choices get frustration rest us pay someone careless health. never want see day actually allowed Yeah let‚Äôs every person goes hospital makes poor health decisions obese, addicts, smokers. Super smart OMG that's go story dumb are. Uhm, many stories. stories like get, likely placebo cases happen. there's one link stats.

Asymptomatic transmission happening vaccinated people because....wait it...the vaccine prevents infection first place. 

Side effects covid eliminated - guessed - get infection causes side effects.

Just go get vaccinated. Please. Exactly, understand fact made available really risk. doesn‚Äôt mean everyone -has- get right now. Ultimately I‚Äôm fine both, everyone make choice. imagine. nearly 500 days. position talk media almost daily youre still trying explain people cant vaccination social distance masking. like, gotta implement least one things (one clearly better others)

and make statement statement thats saying stuff youve already saying almost 500 days

at point youd feel like street corner preacher...only offering something real right. Ozone actually make harder breathe certain groups, like suffer asthma allergies. also kill pet birds. know. 2-14 days incredibly wide range (99.9% confidence interval maybe?), average supposedly 5 original strain. I've seen research alpha delta, supposed longer contagious period logically maybe mean could different time symptom onset. ""final variant"" flawed way thinking. Viruses evolve continuously like living plants animals. 

I guarantee time better safer vaccines could developed realise urgency pandemic. lot people dying could gotten much, much, much worse. vaccines available working quite well quite safely, maybe perfectly, enough completely overshadow much larger risk letting covid run rampant. Sink Florida Sink wonder &amp; Oh well . ACA allow insurance companies charge different premiums (which totally agree with). Well odds vaccine-resistant strain develops? Yes including 80 90 year olds make significant portion deaths. you‚Äôre 40, it‚Äôs probably closer 1/1000 0.1% either way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [Seems like lower vaccine rates mostly South LA](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm) (with pockets less populated areas). map shows first dose percentages, fully vaccinated rates.

That put understandable spin choices made many Covid go without masks gather family friends. sure many people aware consequences social aspect life held much meaning ignored risks quality life rich social interaction important focusing quantity life without it. doesn‚Äôt directly explain vaccine hesitancy. nature transmissible respiratory infection much greater impact everyday encounters others virus transmitted intimate contact bodily fluids. Still lets think bit compassionately toward made choices. clearly top priority rn huh Go back sleep America, government control.

I think make informed decisions, that's right. see right information qualify myself, I'm getting vaccine. (and yes, I'm fully vaccinated got flu vaccine number years) Agreed points Could link report? find anything 32% case breakthrough cases. unvaccinated really selfish assholes‚Ä¶?

Hyperbole. overwhelming majority unvaccinated unvaccinated personal-belief reasons, actions directly endanger rest still solve large part population told vaccinated yet‚Ä¶. (AIDS, Transplant patients, even auto-immune steroids patients).

We solution: [Herd Get enough population vaccinated, virus stops spreading. We've seen happen diseases, global supply chains not. virus spreading region, infecting *can't* get vaccinated, either.

But work, need many people vaccinated possible. polio, 80%. measles, 95%. COVID, know yet. even bad measles, well, add AIDS, transplant patients, autoimmune steriods patients, still going 5% population, could still actually protect people getting measles shots. add antivaxxers, suddenly get measles biggest issue all‚Ä¶ billions billions doses still needed poorer countries corrupt governments and/or suspicious population would rather kill representatives get vaccinated.

Yeah, that's problem. political will, though, virus fly across oceans own. also stupid people problem can‚Äôt think critically whatsoever evaluate risks appropriately. people need part get vaccine‚Ä¶. nowhere else go Singapore. People desperate get out. 

FYI cruise sailings without issue since end last year. Also guests need take mandatory pcr test 3 days boarding. Add low cases Singapore high vaccination rates (70+% adults 1 dose) means cruising quite safe here. 1.2 half 2.5 pretty much Yes, goalposts move. lot easier companies/places require vaccine. Yuh, US recorded 750,000 excess deaths since Jan 2020 (which total number deaths recorded, since probably know means) It‚Äôs vaccines they‚Äôre taking action making appointment getting poke arm. vaccines *know* they‚Äôll get side effects plus whatever conspiracy theory believe happen (or think).

When choose risk COVID vaccine, they‚Äôre taking action going along life usual. *feels* like nothing bad happen them. Depends state you‚Äôre in. example, mine set emergency protections rising premiums Covid, made unemployed employed people eligible state health plan, made diagnosis treatment free. Funny enough, we‚Äôve comparatively deaths hospitalizations. Maybe testing treatment encouraged. That's case fatality rate. Infection fatality rate estimated considerably lower, around 0.6%

It's still something want roll dice with. Poor people recieve vaccines want well. see saying that's system set up. People become saddled medical debt can't pay. They'll declare bankruptcy, taxpayers foot bill. Simultaneously, hospital provided services sell debt eat cost, results higher pricing higher insurance rates us. dont know everyone disagrees you. im completely baffled kinda makes lose hope get first part, conclude second statement? #1 priority protecting health safety children. 100% right. message isnt working.

So, think that‚Äôs going last year more? shit I‚Äôm grateful live state covers Covid diagnosis treatment. Jesus. least absolute number deaths April May.

I repeat, data proven wrong, go check  agree sentiment denying medical coverage anyone bad idea, human perspective financially. pay price uninsured.  kids born vaccinated people born without virginity

I want live planet anymore. WT actual F. wise caring King good country democratically elected populist.

Well, die Covid side effects won‚Äôt issue anymore. 1.8%.

We get vaccinated, am.. leave alone, make world much safer afraid.  1+ year later Just. Is. Not. Improving. People said, give time, shortness breath improve eventually, especially exercise. may true people. me. getting better. getting worse. appears 'new normal'. Anecdotal (sample size one). bet majority Fox News anchors vaccinated. like Trump vaccinated.

They won‚Äôt ones dying. viewers be. Plus vaccinated people still get sick. But, matter either. Utterly selfish. government's role set baselines, there's bar reasonableness, needed form community cohesion. One cannot function practically extremely segregated community...we tried work.

Mods, stop self reported surveys? There‚Äôs also control group symptoms psychosomatic There's definitely plenty reasons trust anything coming Gov.

Full approval likely won‚Äôt new year. content inside QR code signed, signature checked database stored no, that's easy trick.   There's strong feedback loop too. statistics/headlines shared, vaccinated individuals think can't get infected/don't need get tested, even symptoms. husband's family got together reunion Maine last week; every single one came heavy ""cold"" even occur get tested covid. assume, given stats like this, risk catching/spreading (which incorrect). sadly, kids getting can't vaccinated yet. mean yes - that‚Äôs viral diseases effectively ended vaccines. I've seen posts /UK suggesting basically unachievable via natural infection. concern might make variants likely (then assured abroad, whatever here). However, seem widespread exposure virus likely booster effect existing immunity, possibly reducing need boosters.  threshold herd immunity slow spread significantly

quite possibly 90%, maybe even 95% anywhere got cases due delta variant, since rate transmission R0 ~6-8 roughly 3x rate 'wild type' strain herd immunity threshold 70-80%. tricky thing vaccine protection, natural immunity, stopping transmission delta. put 95% above. diphtheria R0 ~6-7 threshold ~85% herd immunity. perfect immunity, perfect vaccine. control symptoms

Why people keep giving poorly designed studies consideration? headline said ""...as Delta variant infects unvaccinated"" saw earlier morning. Guess scary enough. say - huge error part. long COVID studies flawed, control, self-report. even studies show 10-25 percent max. also teaching people drive, driving tests, driving licenses. lot reduce risk driving.

Delta Spreads, Virus Cases Rise New York City
But vaccines, health experts don‚Äôt expect recent increase reach levels seen New York City‚Äôs first second waves.

July 14, 2021Updated 9:22 a.m. ET

Fueled Delta variant, daily coronavirus case counts New York City begun climbing recent days, even city seems determined turn page pandemic.

Just weeks ago, 200 new cases day across city average, lowest level since early days pandemic. city streak days 400 cases. test positivity rate doubled: 0.6 percent average 1.3 percent.

Those numbers still low, increase swift, surprising epidemiologists public health officials expected see cases jump quickly remaining level throughout June.

Still, 64 percent adults city fully vaccinated, epidemiologists said unlikely Delta variant would create conditions anywhere near devastating past two waves Covid-19.

Officials experts concerned

‚ÄúAlarming right word‚Äù describe recent uptick cases, said Denis Nash, epidemiologist CUNY Graduate School Public Health Health Policy. ‚ÄúI would say concerning.‚Äù

The Delta variant far contagious original form virus swept across city March 2020. also contagious even highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant (which first detected Britain since renamed Alpha) edged variants city‚Äôs long second wave.

The Delta variant detected cases New York City February second wave, really made inroads past two months, relatively little virus circulating city. end May, accounted 8 percent cases sequenced city, mid-June, 40 percent. Yet throughout June, number infections stayed low, 200 cases day.

Given contagious Delta variant is, experts surprised case counts eventually started climbing. Countries around world experiencing surge result Delta. United Kingdom, vaccination rate surpasses United States, cases soared, hospitalizations risen slowly.

‚ÄúThe metrics keep close eye hospitalizations deaths,‚Äù said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor epidemiology Columbia University.

So far, metrics remained stable New York City. seven-day average number daily hospitalizations week remained 20. city recently seen four five Covid-related deaths day average.

Officials hoped parade celebrating essential workers earlier month would help kickstart summer low virus numbers. Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times
The hope, expectation, summertime would time cases. Case counts stayed low New York last summer city emerged devastating first wave. change September, rising transmission spots Brooklyn Queens preceded citywide increase cases eventually became second wave lasted spring.

In interviews recent weeks, epidemiologists said expecting calm summer followed uptick cases around time students returned school Manhattan office workers migrated back office.

Your Coronavirus Tracker: We‚Äôll send latest data places care day.

But last week June, number people testing positive suddenly jumped, crossing 300 June 30. four-day streak 400-plus cases followed last week.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen increase cases positivity, we‚Äôve also seen hospitalization rates continue go lower,‚Äù Mayor Bill de Blasio said week.

The city focused Staten Island

In news conferences, health officials tended focus one borough vaccination rates city average, wearing masks unpopular positivity rates tend exceed city average ‚Äî much past year.

‚ÄúIn Staten Island, percent positivity case numbers increased recent days weeks,‚Äù city health commissioner, Dr. Dave Chokshi, said Monday. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs unvaccinated individuals, particularly younger people, remain unvaccinated.‚Äù

But uptick goes far beyond Staten Island. Case counts climbed significantly every borough. Brooklyn, average daily case counts nearly doubled recent weeks 60 100. Tuesday, ZIP code highest average positive test rate city, 4.89, Harlem.

The unvaccinated vulnerable

Health officials said vast majority testing positive fully vaccinated.

The Health Department yet released statistics many new cases among people fully vaccinated. Data countries shows full regimen vaccines use New York offers high degree protection Delta variant.

Still, breakthrough cases difficult find. Stories circulate Twitter, clinics testing sites.

Tony Smith, 31-year-old Brooklyn resident works social impact company, thought done Covid spring, got two doses Pfizer vaccine. already caught virus New York‚Äôs initial wave, suffering range symptoms, including chest pain. months afterward, resting heart rate elevated.

After second shot vaccine, heart rate dropped began feel normal.

Then Sunday, woke feeling slightly sick. next day heart rate felt higher. felt terrible sensation chest first Covid-19. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like crinkling aluminum foil chest,‚Äù Mr. Smith said.

He tested positive virus Monday.

So far, said, symptoms felt much milder compared first infection. ‚ÄúI tell right now, it‚Äôs hugely comforting vaccinated,‚Äù said.

Delta caused city consider restrictions

So far, Delta variant led city drastically change public health guidance virus-related restrictions. affected plans many large companies get workers back desks Manhattan, according Kathryn Wylde, president Partnership New York City, leading business association.

‚ÄúIt would prudent elected officials specified advance if, circumstances would walk back certain components opening up,‚Äù Professor Nash said.

For now, city‚Äôs main strategy Delta continue urging unvaccinated get vaccinated. recent months, number doses administered fallen precipitously.

While vaccination rates high lower half Manhattan, much Queens, parts Brooklyn, lag behind elsewhere, especially Black ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods.

Already sharp racial disparities infection rate death rate first two waves pandemic, virus hitting Hispanic Black New Yorkers hardest. disparities could grow even pronounced Delta, given uneven vaccination rates.

‚ÄúWith Delta variant expect see outbreaks ZIP codes African Americans live low vaccination rate,‚Äù said Dr. Kitaw Demissie, dean School Public Health SUNY Downstate Medical Center Brooklyn.

The measles offer blueprint

In interviews, epidemiologists said anticipate might happen next, helpful remember 2018-2019 measles outbreak largely concentrated Orthodox Jewish communities Williamsburg Brooklyn. city‚Äôs response major shutdowns, enforcement vaccination requirements.

‚ÄúWe localized outbreaks ‚Äî similar outbreaks saw measles,‚Äù Dr. Demissie said. expected outbreaks largely track areas low vaccination rates.

The city scrambling figure raise vaccination rates, offering in-home vaccinations incentives. Mr. de Blasio shown little interest mandating vaccinations pressuring people testing requirements inconveniences. mandated vaccinations city government‚Äôs 400,000-person work force, San Francisco has. EU really fair yet. We're still supply-constrained there's lots people want vaccine waiting appointment. according every single person know lifted mean stop safe :( seems like people need start dying Huge numbers people realize game. still say covid 2019, would actually say good chance another respiratory virus. something going around office well early 2020 covid, similar covid symptoms, know antibody tests. Yes? wild  see std cancer punishment following beliefs. issue first study analysing data samples collect analyse results self reported laboratories varying standards, collection methods, test manufacturers?

Study design: 
""Literature review pooled analysis.""

Another one study August 2020, presumably improved testing methods equipment time.

I vividly remember patients unable tested area last year *swabs*, things. seem sustainable  No. sample population restricted symptomatic.

‚ÄúIn new study, researchers recruited 431 participants within contact tracing system Zurich, Switzerland. participants tested positive SARS-CoV-2 February August 2020, completed online questionnaire health median 7.2 months diagnosis. Symptoms present diagnosis 89% participants 19% initially hospitalized. Compared individuals participating study, participants younger -- average age 47.‚Äù forget people saying COVID would eradicated months ago people wore masks. Yes, people dumbies wearing masks needlessly spreading virus, stamp virus lol. Lifting mask mandate incredibly short sighted. Wearing piece fabric minor inconvenience. Covid December/January 2019/2020. definitely long Covid symptoms--reduced lung capacity/shortness breath, chronic cough, fatigue, brain fog, took long time sense smell come back. Almost resolved first dose, hopefully taking mean wont come back you! might take year Conservatives already really dislike vaccine think implies women premarital sex.

I wish Bob principal high school. 

nominativus, genetivus, dativus... Sorry - misread numbers.

But go: ~2.5x past month. People ventilators almost 3x.

And *know* lag case load. mean lied? whoa, sounds crazy shit jarring  playing second fiddle Trump anymore think now? long aren‚Äôt actually stopping access them, doubt there‚Äôs anything law do. can‚Äôt really force anyone, even government, advertise something, kind thing common strategy right (e.g., blocking voting info, health insurance reg info, etc.) could sleep day constantly exhausted  Non-violence think violence called for. far mark think.  solution covid get vaccinated. lot people modify lifestyle decrease risk catching Covid could get vaccinated. Title really ""Argentina finds China's Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine 84% effective preventing death people aged 60 over""

This already original document's title, would delete info news title? people read title. Key takeaway, vaccines work, extremely well!

""None county-operated hospitals admitted single COVID-19 patient fully vaccinated, according county health department."" Ya sure, get that. said COVID little effect. saying personally consider losing one 2 senses 'very little'. I've heard happening large percentage people contracted COVID. said don‚Äôt necessarily prevent infection 100% time.
That doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt inhibit infection transmission do. think latest figures I‚Äôve seen Delta variant someone double dose vaccinated around 50% less likely get infected fewer symptoms lower viral load, vaccinated become infected 50% less likely transmit infection onto others. cuts transmission vaccinated others 75% - that‚Äôs huge that‚Äôs besides fact vaccinated people vastly higher chance survival. came everyone required wear masks that's restriction, would fine that. Like said, huge deal. see point one else wearing one. might well take mine off. Yes, know masks help wearer, chances me, vaccinated individual, getting severe COVID extremely low (likely even lower due previous infection).

Going forward, I'll probably wear mask situations. Public transit probably one, live city much convenient drive. wonder anyone actually, literally protested family member form something radical, like going fast getting arrested protests family member something little ""crazy"". would wonder far anti-vaxxer would go would maybe cave little say okay, maybe right.

I think crazy right people going ""crazy"" way should. one, almost one seems capable serious civil disobedience response truly high magnitude problems. relevant. Looks like Congress least power heavily incentivize vaccinate among states. mention 10th amendment like said. executive branch also relevant powers here. Update: State health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said tweet Tuesday seven children ICU two life support surge delta variant cases.

Dr. Dobbs corrected previous report state health department incorrectly stated 12 children ICU 10 life support.   Along that, need find way compress trial approval process age groups. Kids shouldn‚Äôt left unprotected spreading disease ~10 months adults *in pandemic*.

I, too, lost sympathy most* unvaccinated people (*I know special circumstances.) people realise covid never going away unless you‚Äôre vaccinated. strategy work long run Guess I'm 'enormously selfish' making decisions health... worst people brought pandemic monstrous political landscape.   Yeah... another self reported survey control group. Getting tired these.  CFR terrible since get high numbers test hospitalized -- happened early pandemic still happening countries surges happening.

IFR involve imperfect statistical modeling, done properly, accurate measure ""if get covid -- chances surviving"".  I'm sure it'll recede it'll take lot longer anyone would like.

Yeah 40lbs crazy even crazier went hospital weighing 180lbs (normally 140lbs) put bed rest. even go bathroom bed. got bed like day 6, lost 30 lbs. one weirdest sensations I've ever experienced. felt like could jump touch sky. I‚Äôm saying natural infection protective vaccination. I‚Äôm wondering loud combination vaccine types might give people immune responses advantages both.

The AZ + Pfizer trials done UK would seem indicate exactly happens. thought read response AZ + Pfizer even better 2 Pfizer, can't find right now.  US one educated nations world? Weird‚Ä¶
Here‚Äôs three actual studies demonstrate substantial 9-30% false negative based sample people self selected responding survey, 19% hospitalization rate. representative sample. porbably like 100,000 cases tbh, insufficient testing rural areas, considerably high population density. True, fair people aged 60 older. wonder vaccines compare that.   mean, 26% symptomatic Covid positive people? Imagine dying COVID insurance companies. üòé frustrated. husband work trip (the entire plane company) last week. vaccinated tested PCR daily. many people flight tested positive. Many people company test almost daily job. couple talked positive far symptoms. husband came back trip last week mild cold-like symptoms.

Ya, deaths maybe 1 1/120. Life time disability, maybe another 1 120 minimum? Medium term disability maybe another 5 6 120. Short term suffering nastiest sickness ever life, maybe 10 120 minimum. New variants damaging apparently. one knows exact numbers.... glad vaccinated.... insane get vaccinated. least one I‚Äôve heard either don‚Äôt trust government don‚Äôt trust pharmaceutical companies. fair trump charge I‚Äôd bit skeptical sure mean. 

Healthy people usually hospital general. seem implying excess deaths covid infections, true. People put yearly checkups, literal surgeries remove cancer months, etc. Contagious irrelevant question coverage insurance vaccinated still able spread covid. Limiting/denying coverage would essence saying ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt covering you‚Äù. many people say things like without actually thinking Another way approach is, disease 0% fatality rate 99% population 100% fatality rate 1% population. one would argue needs everyone work together. 7/10 000 000 people = everyone takes vaccines gets cancer, heart attacks brain explodes, that's much worse Covid. fucking idiot vaccine authority shot foot good approving revoking authorization astro zenica I'd say I'm trust FDA Thank you, I'd appreciate that. look who‚Äôs vaccinated database? numbers true that's 1/120, quite different 1/50.

It‚Äôs lagging indicator, takes time happen, time report compile. mention snowball future cases, deaths mutations. Takes full picture emerge. Anecdotally, 4 fully-vaccinated friends mine tested positive last week, symptomatic. One reported nurse administered test three fully-vaccinated positives day. think it‚Äôs common news would us believe. I'm sorry loss. dad died overdose last June. easy. There's help addicts want it, wanting tough dad. Life already basically normal. Besides wear mask hospital seems like 2019 go day. People die every day. flu still kills people. Nothing 100% safe there‚Äôs always chance dying every day. don‚Äôt really see nothing normal considering immunity covid increase vaccines people surviving infections. Eventually it‚Äôll like flu. mild inconvenience worst unless you‚Äôre incredibly old. Children exactly going tell suffer long COVID myocarditis.

It's overall short sighted adults people compare flu, especially likely months away vaccinating children. Greetings under. prime minister (we call Promo) announced ""1 3 eligible Australians vaccinated"".

If back solve math ""eligible"" works &lt;20%...   Half many per day time last month Maine. Vaccines work. Shocking. general area could GERD, hopefully heart inflammation   parent, wish could downvote harder. Schools proven significant vector community spread.

Are likely die you‚Äôre 12? happened. 25-50? Chances much higher Delta.

You really think covid going disappear everyone took one current vaccines?

It‚Äôs gonna us long time regardless. process working written. gave emergency clearance vaccines enough data establish safe highly effective drug. review long term data review much higher sample size 140+ million people getting vaccine. reason still wear masks children 12, vaccine approved. point, anyone refuses vaccine dies COVID complications thereof recipient award named English biologist authored Theory Evolution, whose name cannot say sub bot ban comment Rule 1 grounds. \*want\* anyone die, I'm past point caring stupid.

Yeah, makes virus insidious IMHO number asymptomatic mild cases. screws people's perceptions makes think ""not big deal"". Waiting novavax body, choice.

Who cares many die it‚Äôs decision risk it, even risk small. 1. Get vaccinated. Hardly take care kids ill
2. Avoid unnecessary BS. need hide kids basement, neither wise overexpose them. 
3. healthy life style help kids fighting disease.

Finally, overstress point trying make beside ‚ÄúI‚Äôll want‚Äù ? DeSantis always willing take low road, even water. entire family fine. Kids ended congestion low grade fevers. wife showed symptoms, needed bed rest sleep off. 

Vaccines still work. Rare cases like happen, long require hospitalization lead death, a-okay. walker oxygen tank living normal can. worried living altogether. 4 heart attacks joke.  mean, obvious absurd already required. waiting for??? people wise come around? going happen. choice. Either get vaccine stay home. place deserves named variant Florida. mean pretty much everyone get vaccine, right? 

At point die Covid choice sympathy. Let natural selection thing. so?

Trump-Desantis 2024 flags flying Lake County already.   overwhelming majority make full recovery without needing medical care.

It‚Äôs choice get vaccinated point worry.  Heaps AZ. many Pfizer. Unfortunately health advice give AZ 60 unless discussed GP. Perhaps it‚Äôs time require proof vaccine enjoy benefits society. Travel, restaurants, sporting events, etc. 
It seems working France. Vaccinations way up. 
I guess private businesses want. Maybe even antivax establishments value freedom obstinate. Let free market sort out. don‚Äôt think message thinking vulnerable isn‚Äôt used manipulate one compliance ? vulnerable people done themselves. talking friend last year year started taking medicine cholesterol medicine 30s.

Remember also small numbers comparatively population millions. Right, worried kid got flu Let's overreact. Cases course go return normal.

Instead keep eye hospitalizations death rates. important now.

And aside, antivaxx assholes get sick die, it. made choice. Reducing risks still good masks minor inconvenience times. Whats point   37 We‚Äôre substantially less testing I'd go say like looking road accidents UK. Say 100,000 collisions 2020, 98,000 involved RH drive vehicles. 
To conclude LH drive vehicles 49x safer would ridiculous. 


Yet that's ""study"" effectively doing.   agree this, think people decided take masks (depending situation) decided that, them, minor inconvenience worth additional reduction risk? Sorry hear happened you! type mask wearing may ask?  37 220 5' 11""  time last year, 70k cases/day, 800 deaths/day. Right we're 20k cases/day, 200 deaths/day. today, three whole states accounting nearly half daily cases. state 0.002% population test positive yesterday. 

Stop panicking fearmongering. Well said. 

We lot reasons hopeful third wave bad, there's also good reason cautious too. end wave see near herd immunity one way other, though. fundamental problem. ""lethal"" sadly correct. local lockdown downs..... People shit scared , plus beds hospitals oxygen. people took precautions.

But times changed , tourist places hotel beds, people wer sleeping cars overnight. third wave close by.  think still chunk people haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine due logistical challenge work, online scheduling, lack transportation, etc. get people, improvement. We‚Äôll never get conspiracy people. think corporations also play role. power country. would hard stay away Walmart target forever protest mask policies. UK, understand cases going up. presumably severity going down, involves younger people becoming infected. Presumably majority recovering without serious Covid symptoms. real metric policy decisions‚ÄîCovid severity. Right?  None good news worth, got back bachelor party Las Vegas behaved like Covid exist. 11 guys, 10 vaccinated. 5 us tested positive Covid yesterday, vaccinated. unvaxxed person tested negative. 3 5 pretty sick fevers such, two feel less normal. definitely still get sick vaccinated die go hospital matters end day.

Keep talking bullshit - study 83.5% general efficacy vs original strain, study 66% general efficacy vs Lambda &amp; Gamma strains. AZ lower efficacy vs original strain hardly tested vs Lambda\\Gamma, J&amp;J 66% vs original one. also consider effective? mean based existing mortality rates, assuming everyone unvaccinated got infected, need something like 99.9% adults get vaccinated 0% kids order significant pediatric population, outside spreading it. need open eligibility everyone now. need get shots arms immediately outweighs potential risks speeding approval process. FDA wants things book, fucking emergency need action mean? Nice weather, low taxes, never hour beach. guess people moving droves reason huh? everything else. Americans gloss 600k DEAD PEOPLE. Real human beings families friends. 

Meanwhile I‚Äôm sitting safe Australia don‚Äôt know ONE person even contracted virus. 

Somehow inept government hit bullseye vaccines. Don‚Äôt forget country complete shitshow past 12 months. pediatrician tell you? trying supportive. risk extremely extremely low.   someone who's visited Paris before, hilarious Covid dominated last 18 months so, health issues taken backseat government public's eye. mean, need limit exercise strictly indoors. Plenty ways get exercise outdoors. uncle one year. problem still 20%-30% adult population unvaccinated. Without restrictions tear clusters population possibly still overwhelm hospitals enough bad luck. vaccinated? I‚Äôm guessing unless you‚Äôre immunocompromised. going office week comfortable you? wear mask, fully vaccinated person office that‚Äôs presumably 20% full, objectionable? that‚Äôs risky you, ANYWHERE last 16 months now? one grocery store, indoor place, nothing?   Yeah well though long term less effective vaccine great either. Especially mutations making vaccines bit less effective. want leeway.

But completely agree 100% government. Hmm, ""The spray employs nitric oxide mechanical chemical barrier viral infection nose, respiratory diseases like COVID-19 infiltrate body. "" Sounds interesting. I've also seen papers re: preventive nasal application 1% baby shampoo, Iota Carrageenan, Xylitol. would cool see work comparison, combination. 

A phase II trial mentioned here: 

I can't seem find literature citation. yet qualify US. plan fall. developed drinking problem too. Mostly went bed drunk, recurring dreams people banned seeing (because travel bans). Feeling happy loved dreams waking empty apartment made want die, drinking preferable that. Desantis condemned vaccinations? garbage Fauci spews adding reply part, vaccinated people protected. 

I understand that, mask others wearer, making moot Furthermore, vaccinated ones w ho spreading virus.

Don't still spread it, even lower rate, since still catch it? cf post you! preach stressor. 2 year old starts daycare 2 weeks I‚Äôll back work teaching 2nd grade. school dropped masks kids upcoming school year, added stress. I‚Äôm crossing fingers everyone stays healthy. (reposting yesterday's since still understand)

Hey,

Honestly understand this: COVID vaccination getting (deadly) sick fully preventing getting virus transmitting it, vaccinated people required still mask infection numbers way down? question American redditors: years ago seemed like *lot* news coverage opiate epidemic overdose deaths country - documentaries, long-form articles, etc coming time. deaths higher ever, issue still getting lot focus domestically? ask seems like attention drifted topic longer talked much - used 'hot' topic Reddit also constant posts (pill mills, prescription abuse, etc) much? may wrong, course.

I'm respectfully curious things look inside USA. fuck dude. talked them. totally line assumptions. They're working hard this. want rushed dangerous. Bake cake. find fixed definition what's excessive.

Someone would need decide whatever legal restrictions place challenge costs courts point judge probably attempt determine extra fees can't justify strictly prevent people using services probably ruled excessive.

The estimated attack rate Z initial R solution Z=1-e^RZ . indeed secondary attack rate. unrealistic fears. Talk pediatrician risks. dangerous adults young children unless extremely serious health condition risks covid far something stressed over. Unfortunately kids lose  take funding. developed without federal funding. administration agreed buy some. There's reason panic, good reason pay attention adjust behavior, even vaccinated. threads Twitter people (younger, healthy people) got COVIID vaccination sick dogs. Yes, vaccine absolute must blessing, likely prevents hospitalization death. feel much safer outdoors. still would rather puking/feverish week. I'm going back wearing masks indoors around strangers. Ya need talk conspiracy mentality. Tell foreign enemies China Russia least effective vaccines Sputnik sinovac 50 percent would love western Trump made vaccines used weakens military production (ex Tyson food meat plant shut downs covid outbreaks) enemies watches us disarray. Look healthy tan Trump looks he‚Äôs got first dosages. I‚Äôve never seen Ted desantis look better.

I‚Äôm gagging point convinced patients get it. It‚Äôs like conspiracy inside conspiracy. Death rate dropping since deaths primarily happens older people. someone else mentioned sick people that's problem.

But that's irrelevant well, worst part COVID get sick likely symptom taste/smell messed up. I've COVID months ago long since recovered smell still fucked up. basically smell everything there's also smell smoke nose 24/7. 

VERY annoying people COVID realize symptoms continue months months. Basically everyone know who's covid taste smell affected way. 'Norwegian' bit misnomer. believe refers country registration, believe wholly US owned - experience 90% crewed Phillipino's played 2 poker games last week suburbs NYC. 2 players vaccinated. one them. CDC knows non-insignificant percentage people country either conspiracy obsessed morons, self-proclaimed idiot savants latch onto, misquote, misconstrue otherwise bastardize data suit purpose. trying make virus seem worse panic people, trying justify anti-vax theology. 

They know breakthrough infections, also know extremely mild symptoms all. potential damage people could misusing data greater IMO tracking focusing getting people vaxed. lost dear friend Pandemic OD. beautiful light World. got detox mental health/drug court appointments next 37 days. Within 4 days gone. bad batch heroin high concentration carfentanyl. R.I.P. Earnestine. Last year heard ambulances assumed covid related. know it‚Äôs likely drug related. exactly implying here?

i dont know makes difference negative test could return work. took 6 covid tests finally tested negative. Consistent stat, personally believe actual number ~2%. However, that‚Äôs subject significant estimates/judgment, tried conservative making point (when comparing 20%, 2% versus 3% doesn‚Äôt really make much difference). OP modify title brilliant job vaccines Delta came along. that's case Sydney. So, bet polymarket? dunno that. US much better securing vaccines result isn‚Äôt locked down. Australians hand can‚Äôt even gather 2 people outside, dunno ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù. modify title. click link, news headline exactly same. Here's clinical data regarding breakthrough infections:

Clinicogenomic analysis  breakthrough infections  SARS CoV2 variants ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 vaccination  healthcare workers

""Majority infections  clinically mild  fever, bodyache, cough, headache, diarrhoea vomiting respiratory rate &lt; 24/min SpO2: ‚â• 94%  room majority breakthrough infections vaccinated health workers mild

""Consistently finding 94% breakthrough infections mild, 4% moderate 2% SARS-CoV-2 Infections Prison Vaccination




""All cases Covid-19 needs sell ""1 Covid cases"" shirts. one issue - self selected completing survey 15% hospitalization rate. 

You‚Äôd want study representative denominator recruits people w/o w/ limited self selection. 

This could accomplished simply creating study w/ stratified components, i.e. include set % people hospitalized, mild, asymptomatic, based best estimates available. Recruiting people still issue mitigated paying people participate. 

None would perfect would almost certainly better current studies, seem emailing calling people list PCR positive people much likely hospitalized seek treatment general covid positive population.  anything vaccines. china totalitarian mean vaccines developed bad. They've approved many countries WHO. means effective safe. Keep wearing mask ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ones forcing take mask.

It‚Äôs little different sequence used mRNA vaccines, different antigenic sites. 

I think research done using Coronavac vaccine Pfizer together. thing could find mixing sinopharm Pfizer.  Yes, some, however, definitely pandemic related, bit misleading post sub. trending upward coastal regions northeast even pandemic. pandemic convenient excuse pretend already happening (looking you, Cape Cod. Major issues drug use years, bury news make extremely hard rehab services come reach local populations. Optics important lives there. Big claiming issues entirely pandemic, us know that's untrue). depends country. That's really case France. Irish public health team gotten lot criticism endorsing them. know feel stage. Nope, guy Oklahoma City I'm betting not. I'm betting politicians probably disregard anyway. guess see, public sentiment quite fickle. It‚Äôs pretty much got shot. 93% effective Delta.

It's different time, however. ways protect vaccination. should, however, feel sympathy legitimately unable vaccinate medical reasons. group that's often high risk covid complications suffer decisions chose get vaccinated. I‚Äôm commenting general attitude towards Americans non Americans regards COVID. great Leader LEADS, follow idiots. thought read response AZ + Pfizer even better 2 Pfizer, can't find right ‚ÄúWe‚Äù - unless you‚Äôre US citizen. US isn‚Äôt tracking breakthrough cases aren‚Äôt hospitalizations. 


Because CDC seems uniquely qualified task, disappointing they‚Äôre tracking breakthrough cases. it‚Äôs worth noting CDC isn‚Äôt option: NIH, academic medical centers, state regional health departments, private companies, variety grant funders, well researchers countries, decide support efforts track breakthrough cases.
In days, weeks, even months come, it‚Äôs possible CDC reverse decision resume tracking breakthrough cases. Regardless shine light breakthrough cases, would seem wise pay more, less, attention many anti-vaxxers, available everybody older 18 years old since June 25th, wanted vaccine already got first jabs vaccination speed dropped compared 2 weeks ago.    enjoy hand cold holding it! might low-effort troll I‚Äôve ever seen.

It almost certainly keep getting worse without lockdown. whole country go hard lockdown vaccines arrive. really? going increase price products services make difference. average consumer going get fucked yet again, way. encouraging news. [69% 188 million people USA receive dose COVID 19 vaccine August 1 according prediction market polymarket signifies improved vaccination rate Political climate Florida severely changed, don‚Äôt know unless becomes president. state longer swings vaccinated available kids yet. why?!  stated reasoning this? Living south basically ‚Äúwall‚Äù resistance point super frustrating. I‚Äôm watching anti-vaxx friends get sick sympathy gone. Well, ""much, much better nothing"" numbers. that, they're reflection reminder many place's feelings towards vaccine, representation real reason many us cannot go outside right now... mention could infected others without realizing it. That's pretty shitty. unfortunate mean vaccines work. 

If 20% plane tests positive 10% symptomatic that's pretty consistent expect (I assuming plane crowded nobody wore masks). Without vaccines probably everyone would positive. Elimination work literally entire world conjointly, literally never happen. Australia willing die hill zero-Covid strategy we‚Äôre seeing that‚Äôs turning them.  want do, lockdown forever?   Moderna Pfizer American companies. Moderna believe developed Maryland  traveled Arkansas last weekend. swell time Mississippi department health cut comments Facebook nothing vaccine conspiracies. Also highest case count, 641, since around April. adults vaccinated, wont matter they'll likely asymptomatic... Sounds like issue unvaccinated adults - we're talking comment... vaccination BNT162b2 [Pfizer] increased protection Delta levels comparable Alpha Beta/Gamma.

You're even wrong per se, clearly looking soapbox audience.
