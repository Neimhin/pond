Teach me. Thank hard work, providing healthcare people perhaps, times, undeserving. wish people would protect families get vaccinated. known many people healthcare field unfortunately somewhat common...active smokers oxygen getting breathing treatments, infants NICU mother abused drugs pregnant, etc. People make mistakes life still need compassion care. I'm sure (maybe) Aaron Rodgers Joe Rogan taking ""the good version"", many people taking human version result this. great quarterback. silly-assed, selfish, fucking dishonest human It’s marketing.

Argh. comment shows ignorance. money even referring to? Elaborate getting money, say government, say name. can't. huge success know 2 individuals took died. Nothing could them. massive numbers cut cancer cases amazing miracle think like anything people negative effects. Yes, concern trolling worse antivax. lots problems way pharma run, vaccines well understood, sowing doubt vague accusations zero actual backing beyond idiotic. shows money proven past cut corners aware maximize profit people suffer bc it. don’t vaccinate kids shouldn’t allowed kids. literal science. introduce little bit bad protect kid dying. Please think kids stop believing believing everything read FaceBook aka “Meta” change data. Thank fuck. I'm glad hear found care needed! Hope continue make progress -- never stop fighting well being.   symptoms? daughter got today seems cranky Still “misinformation”  “If kids”-if you’re going try insult please read first. According Facebook flu. Thank you. many times mention don’t kids.. Look Pfizer’s law suits past. exactly honest.  Sorry I’m concerned ethics big pharmaceutical companies proven past shady things. Worse anti-vax asking questions? Live echo chamber much? Well, misdiagnosed long time doctors grew distrustful many result understand healthcare field seems improving many ways easier used get doctors listen health concerns actually get MRIs testing done upon request verify health issues. found good healthcare professionals recent years absolutely wonderful improved quality life genuinely care patients gone long way towards earning trust back. critique, mean independent assessment methods. audit model... look graph, top [their article central estimate global excess deaths seems twice actually reported total. There's quite lot statistical black magic (""gradient boosting"", ""bootstrapping"") behind Economist's estimates, would nice [expert all.  Get ready REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Lyme, top head

Edit:    Stop talking common sense. live prayers random, untested, non FDA approved treatments here! Ivermectin forever doesn’t work, ECMO forever, thoughts prayers lung donor! Nevermind fact someone ::else:: die unrelated thing. Back up, buttercup need people vaccinated quickly possible. Herd immunity nebulous Covid. vaccine absolutely protecting individual. Guess never heard herd immunity? really individual. Sorry  virus many enablers… 700,000 It’s like there’s pandemic going around something… still... protecting unvaccinated. Rogers clearly taken many shots head. CTE incoming. lost quoted good buddy Joe Rogan. Wait hear rubella vaccine mandate! last I've heard also [provide much weaker least compared Pfizer Moderna company detected following antibody levels per Moderna: cc. 8,000 Pfizer/BioNTech: 5,600 AstraZeneca: cc. 1,550 Sputnik V: cc. 1,550 Sinopharm: cc 600 AU/mL

note: testing done Hungary (source english though), they've used wide variety vaccines. Works me! He's allergic lipds (fats), sugars and/or salts? Seriously? 4 ingredients include active ingredient - mRNA. Rogers FOS. allergic anything mRNA vaccine. Good. good point watching segment Rachel Maddow last night realize talking cheaper iv Regeneron/Remdesivir. game changer vaccines likely intranasal one Hope croaks lol  Let bust tiny violin millionaire football man  used less frequently America quite frequently many places.    they've shipping billion doses countries, well beyond EU US sent abroad.

From news article October China provided 1.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses 106 countries four international organizations year, world, Luo Zhaohui, head China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), said press conference Tuesday  kids! /s  Lol. antiviral = horse medicine.

Do see misinformation problem? gives fuck? vaccine shortage?
No?

Then gives fuck? Let everyone them!

so stupid Made humans, used horses. like MANY medicines are. ONLY. developed humans. hear horses now. HAHA ED, THATS HUMAN MEDICINE.

Not civid, amazing river blindness. Yeah don’t get this… vaccines go college. different?! I’m vaccinated. also still wear mask, social distance, etc etc. sometimes wonder people see think get vaccinated stop wearing mask. one wants hear medication saved eyesight millions kids. HORSES! 

So sick hearing it. almost 80 today. Tomorrow think said 76.  Since pill, theoretically possible get every willing person take pill time wipe thing out. daughter’s pediatrician held vaccine clinic today. booked appt, handful times left. Today called said cancellations happened could take earlier. 2nd dose beginning Dec. Fully covered Christmas. two trips planned delayed could vaccine. excited. Hey now, neither Cap. looks like New Jersey? would put guys 67% vs Colorado's 62% total population fully vaccinated. thing though. vaccines 1 time shot. covid vaccine looks “every 6 month vaccine”

So “this nothing new” incorrect, seem getting misinformation sides issue

Disclaimer: 10 7 year olds got covid vaccine today Yeah, OPV created best immunity could cause infections others vaccinated. Provide example proves wrong then. others stated, titers checked. joined Navy 1994 checked back then. work special education measles outbreak checked back mumps titers low. Now, gone. It’s simple blood test. caught fully vaccinated April, wore mask, work home, etc. Ended mild me, nonetheless, everyone’s got chance getting matter (unless literally go where). Many states laws requiring various vaccines children attending public school must have. Odds laws expanded current political environment slim.

It private sector exercise rights exclude based things like sports physicals, vaccination status, dress code… 

We recently attended touring Broadway show (Frozen Musical.) Masks required everyone, gaiters allowed, anyone 12+ required provide proof COVID-19 vaccination. 12 year old excited show vaccine card. 

Partner met criteria boosters (she’s teacher, got J&amp;J) planned day relaxing cuddling. needed booster side effects mental health. 

TL;DR: Damn feels good vaxxer. Right, they’re pediatrician. would expect know difference. 80% total population fully vaccinated? 80% eligible people one vaccine? mean, we've almost 9 months government mandating vaccine. People saying they'd get told full shit. time pharm company changes anything, patent continue monopoly. includes propellant, coating, solution, etc involve drug itself. pharma company also buy company makes generic. also 'branded generic' class. vaccines protect kids. US, 24 states reporting 24,498 hospitalizations children Covid. deaths Covid polio, mumps, rubella, varicella, Hepatitis B COMBINED year prior vaccines becoming available.  


CDC analysis data showed clear benefit vaccinating kids. Look slide presentations ACIP last week watch recorded video meeting- available CDC website. 

Highly politicized JCVI recommendation isn’t taken seriously American pediatricians infectious disease doctors, responsible British doctors either understand. live Centennial would say grocery stores 80% masked. Every store last couple months required employees wear masks. helps get vaccine blaming gotten continued spread? Meanwhile land free, life expectancy dropped 1.5 years since covid. I’m counting finally get enough population vaccinated put pandemic behind us. 47 states exemptions tho. Also, diseases vaccines deadly kids. COVID isnt. Also, dont need indefinite amount shots, lets even get risk myocarditis.  safe &amp; effective. whatever propaganda watch made afraid vaccines make afraid development well.

Sorry, comes point stop trying reason unreasonable people &amp; simply lay law. workers following threats quit. Natural News instance claimed Measles vaccine killed measles has. Every vaccine endless claims massive harm often use exact logic evidence used COVID vaccine. lot people naively falling anti-vax canards thinking applies COVID vaccine. Maybe opioid crisis left bad mark people.

Dr. Drew, Dr. Oz, maybe even Doctors get question medical professionals.    Vaccines came cases drop. much powerful delta variant spread vaccine helped prevent many deaths. That's hospitalizations deaths 80%+ unvaccinated people.  mRNA delivery mechanism works 20 years, successfully tested 6 years ago humans (see elsewhere comments inks)

Kids serious reactions COVID, particularly Delta variant, including death. seen article two year old toddler dying Delta...  Aaron Rogers fair many instances religious medical exemptions vaccines.  think ""undeserving"" slippery slope. Everyone deserve healthcare, principle, period. Sure, times able provide deserve, that's triage.

My question is: possible actually feel worse got flu vaccine covid booster time? I'm throwing up, higher fever, Tylenol advil help soreness, can't even sleep off. Obviously necessary I'd rather covid, I'm curious there's reason much intense received second dose vaccine.  See response comment. main point original comment Joe Rogan took ivermectin, recovered quickly covid CNN media outlets outright lied even went far edit video make appear sicker was.  Yep,they idea what’s wrong encourage actually watch FDA meeting pediatric infectious disease leaders. Comments panel members start 6:45:00. think people would interested learn lot doctors (including chief pediatric infectious disease Tufts) think mandate would huge error, isn’t enough safety data yet. [It’s shocking people actually go directly source.  smallpox vaccine even available public anymore much less mandated. 50 years...

MMR required kids least decade invented. Here’s problem: many existing, cheap off-patent drugs used safely purposes suspected helpful treating covid. problem is, off-patent, drug company incentive conduct double-blind randomized studies required determine effectiveness covid. governments need subsidize studies. government generally doesn’t carry studies. not? That’s problem anyone wants look details cases UK. Yes, loads vaccinated people get virus. Yes, case numbers high time way down.

Good luck!! US government pays pfizer $19.50 every shot administered.  Thats lot money.  Both. Deaths cases definitely undercounted ago, positivity rate pretty good indicator things are.

Well, that's problem anymore.   vaccines listed actually prevent transmission contracting said disease. 

The Covid vaccine doesn’t either. makes less sick. long-term protection Covid well.

I outbreak office 2 years back. One person it, started getting , vaccine drive setup immunize people wanted get vaccine.

There plenty adults never took vaccine kids ( available /common school) never got kids natural immunity either.

I imagine schools asking vaccines handle logistics. office mandates setting drive helped lot keeping control, sound unreasonable. great news. saying case actually possible allergic ingredients present vaccines “lipids, sugars fats” cover extremely wide array substances.

Weird, we've close half school year record surge COVID cases, kids exactly keeling dead.

And places like Texas Florida schools open last year, kids dropping dead.

The vast majority kids died ""from COVID"" last two years either extremely immuno-compromised already dying something like leukemia. seen perfectly healthy kids dying COVID.

OTOH, seen perfectly healthy kids dropping dead COVID vaccine others suffering permanent heart damage vaccine.

But hey, kids, right?  dentist pull teeth. public ""magnet"" school, kids 30+ different towns. part entire district public magnet schools region.

So people think traditional school, still public school.  evidence long-covid anything generic post-viral symptoms. Kids getting flu display similar levels effects pushing mandate flu vaccines.

There also evidence immunity Pfizer vaccine wanes rapidly among men. Another recent study Israel found six months second dose vaccine, levels antibodies ""substantially lower among men among women.""

Wtf, half??? Good. Thank God states like Missouri, Texas, Florida  article describe well situation. add bits describe situation (Hungary), less 'scientific', like briefing (I'm native Hungarian speaker, less English, pardon spelling):

* 'Forecast' good
  * maybe week reach 2nd wave worst times
  * maybe 2+ week 3rd wave worst
* Near zero restrictions (at least now)
  * Mask mandatory public transport (and hospitals course)
   * So, mask used nowhere else (in generic life)
   * Maybe 10% peoples wear mask general
  * shops open, restaurants/nightclubs open, etc.
  * Near restrictions education (like elementary school). 
   * University start mandatory mask
   * Near zero 'distance learning' 
  * Very-very event (near zero) require 'green card' (vaccination/recover/test)
  * Near 'unbelievable' come another (like Western European) country... 
   * like 'no tomorrow country'...
* Vaccination campaign 
  * Near zero progress new vaccinations (as article also mention) months ! 
  * Vaccination mandatory healthcare workers
  * mandatory vaccination started government workers
   * Eg.: Military, Office worker, progress know, announced 
  * 3rd dose: here: 4 months '2nd dose', everyone allowed get 
   * Usually Pfizer used that, bad progress 
   * Note: get 3rd 1 dose! 
   * May (usually) choose 3rd dose (also depend stocks, etc.)
  * Vaccination requires previous registration
   * So, 'walk-on-by' vaccination today
   * However, get vaccination like 'next day', issue 
   * 'freely choose' vaccine (really!) However, maybe vaccination point time Pfizer Astra, GP may Moderna Janssen, biggie.
* Vaccines here
  * Pfizer; Moderna; Janssen (JJ); AstraZeneca; Sputnik (the Russian one); Sinopharm (China)
  * Practically new vaccinations Pfizer, less Moderna (as less that)
   * Sinopharm (China) practically used anymore ('no one wanted'), regarding Sputnik (not much Sputnik left, seems 'works' 'around like' AstraZeneca), OX/AZ also used much days
* Testing
  * Testing free Doctor 'approve' (like symptomes)
   * nearby countries government provide (or provide near past) free testing 2-6 times month
* Government communication
  * Government practically provide basic data's, like daily: Sum 1st doses, sum 2nd doses, sum 3rd doses, daily new cases, cases hospital, cases 'ventilator', daily new deaths, sum deaths
  * practically near nothing else... overview, graphs, query's, nothing. one 'daily government publication example'. new data weekends 
   * course news sites provide form informations, like   * real official information's areas (counties) similar breakdowns, on. 
   * real information 'breakthrough' cases, etc.
   * real information ICU cases, provide 'Hospital' 'on Ventillator' cases
  * Government popularize (but relatively low efforts) Vaccination only
   * think Masks, restrictions, lockdowns similars
   * guess: mainly elections next spring

The previous 'briefing' style (some details missed course). like ask something, please reply, try best.

p.s.: get 2x Sputnik past, 1x Pfizer (as 3rd dose) natural immunity novel virus non existent? vaccine better zero immunity.. Thank you. problem simply therapeutics general. takes long find actually works. virus random. believe random treatments worked people, yes. believe work everyone, no. also think people said treatment worked virus ran course treatments nothing yes well.  virus random effects you. treatment random too. That's best get vaccinated take precautions now.  two weeks first series one week booster? go this: seat belts prevent car accidents, dramatically reduce chance serious injury car accident. vaccines. No, they're talking quarantine. isolationism. asking sounds lot like long haul symptoms POTS now, r/pots sub may helpful. 

I couldn’t anything, even walk mailbox, without totally fatigued next days found POTS started wearing compression socks. long able go trip walk miles! stuff good health, socks biggest improvement saw. Then, getting vaccine next big jump improvement I’ve steadily getting better there. I’m mainly drinking pedialyte electrolytes wearing compression socks fatigued days. 

I don’t remember exact video about, remember really appreciating channel one knew happening me… know didn’t ask info, remember helpless depressed last year hope help someone else may see it. Wrong tho, 2 first 1 dose 1 week boosters Even though Boulder mandate, wearing there. carry pockets someone mentions put person sight. Boulder enforcing low pay workers refuse put lives line enforce either. Hopefully find productive work. Prison guard employment going ""war drug(user)s"" winds prisons empty out. prisons become major employers. rural areas, pressure maintain level imprisonment steady stream new prisoners save jobs real, IMHO. except measles COMBINED killed fewer children year vaccines introduced Covid has

I would like make slight correction comment really understates serious diseases are.

The data reference account cases children, cases total population (edit: white western countries). majority would kill adult, child example contracts polio chances resulting death astronomical children survive live lives debilitating consequences form amputated limbs organ damage. Please undermine seriousness diseases children. Ok. we’ll add already extensive list necessary required vaccines already gave 🤷🏻‍♂️ cannot understand prolonged freak it. Effective dose? zero, non living organs tissue weighting factor zero. 

It would hard quantify something like CTDIvol DLP case. like they're pro-covid.  Japan really testing(you pay lot test), Korea started last week, think include ""living covid"" success stories. hope get there, can't help wonder open soon.

 Korea seems like there's desperate wishful thinking going politicians (presidential election next spring). 75% fully vaccinated, that's really 65% two week mark. Hopefully okay, think we'll need lot mask discipline, much party/bar activities going work. think link makes point thought did. think brilliant name photon count case, since refers whole synchrotron monochromators filtration presumably still applies beam lines (which might polychromatic). 

It's phase contrast CT though, imaging method rely simple attenuation, uses phase differences scattered x-rays (I think). remember researcher giving talk claim rediculous level image quality per input dose, order 100 1000 times better standard attenuation methods. 

Maybe someone smarter clarify phase differences allow much greater information content idk. evidence effective immunity obtained prior infection (""natural immunity"" bad nomenclature) long immunity lasts scarce while. CDC study great, better information people relying claim ""natural immunity"" better immunity obtained vaccination.

Anyone claiming evidence overwhelming definitive either direction either lying misinformed.   think literally think like literally outside contact.  Great. knew mandates would mean nothing end. respect levels sky rocketing  Yes, can.

Like every vaccine ever created 100% preventative, transmission rate symptoms vaccinated vastly suppressed compared don't.

And make point again, chicken pox lethal kids. I'm old enough kid chicken pox parties intentionally got kid infected much mild children adults.

But require vaccine 1) one, 2) protects vulnerable society. right swing fist ends nose begins. government's inability deploy (much less enforce) even basic public health measures bode well things go REALLY bad virus inevitably pops up.

If virus deadly say Ebola, everyone would staying home vaccine available, everyone would getting vaccinated ASAP. fact vaccine deadly enough reason fight it. Caritas (P7) close hey give people post addresses Meldeadresse anymore, also closed kitchen last year can't stay recharge phone. get Gruft, need know right people, otherwise get trouble wirh clients - can't get Meldeadresse well. Vinzi stuff closing too. AmberMed cool, much can't sleep eat there, course. last ones mentioned exclusively women despite fact 90% homeless men. Notschlafstellen mentioned extremely reduced last two years, date. thing new Chancenhäuser, dangerous human garbage lives there. course can't use sleep obvious reasons, still need sleep outside.

And refugees can't go back lots reasons, often simply can't afford countries take back, they're stuck.  CLEARLY know talking immunologist.

And yet parade around threads like source authority.

Again, people like one biggest problems right now.

Do world favor stop providing medical advice clearly speculative well outside core competence.   relieved child able vaccinated soon. And, see best circumstances regard ear infection. I’m sorry try get negligence refuse wear masks, especially around ill people. Hope stay safe. also 84 cancer. nap could killed guy. 1. less slack, always enough slack
2. Fully vaccinated chance breakthrough, too
3. Even booster give 100 % security, 91 % better boosting
4. fixed date vaccination rule thumb.
5. Anyway want take chances.  great. I'm Centennial often indoor mask usage really picked back since summer. still plenty people pretending nothing's going better lot areas.

It's secret people, too. horse paste reference people taking HORSE medication. understand cdc touts vaccine immunity policy perspective (easy track quantify vaccines taken vs infection acquired immunity), it’s disingenuous pretend people recovered infection contribute herd immunity. Thus far, reinfections rare. time goes we’ll learn duration acquired immunity that’s still big unknown.

It’s also disingenuous media focus antibody counts whilst ignoring b/t cell immunity. really expect boost antibodies indefinitely? downside this?

Many countries recommend single vaccine dose already survived infection minimize adverse reactions. isn’t US able take nuanced approach? Even recent kid Pfizer data recent eua showed zero kids prior infection became infected study (this includes vaccinated control group). actually surprised fda/cdc didn’t recommend single dose children. talking conservative states, going incentives even mandate states get vaccinated. suspect 5th circuit issue ruling OSHA within week ultimately SCOTUS make decision. honestly surprise OSHA mandate stands history OSHA emergency regulations 1 get blocked court. Joe Rogan also monoclonal antibodies, Z-pack antibiotics vitamin drip part treatment. certainly can’t point may effective recovery, obvious didn’t simply take dewormer medication recover. cops still argue shouldn’t wear lie authorities can't defraud virus. pretty much Colorado. counties die hard republicans 30% vaccinations metro areas 80%. flu fucking SUCKS. Good. want dine Sneezy comment might worst false equivalence I've seen here. Equating factual description stuff bullshit antivaxxers claim. need list you, I?

If insist calling horse medicine 'misinformation', calling human medicine, without specifying used for. said, ""blood pressure medicine cures COVID! human medicine!"" That's misinformation. need Robocop Good Yes true, seen, many facilities far less 100 staff. 
Also addition ruling OSHA (who know long take) bound lawsuits mixed protests.
IMHO facility themselves, must right thing. could offer incentives staff. Example. Vaccinated gets fairly nice sized bonus. Quite facilities pay crap staff. good bonus would definitely nice carrot. didn’t. trust research doctors.  college's football coach brought Black doctors talk players importance vaccine summer. star defensive back even became student ambassador vaccine. 

Absolutely, football players board vaccination helps whole community. remember CNN big outlets running stories Vietnam beating covid zero deaths. Granted 25 deaths year that, goes show dangerous delta be. literally is. Ny times whole podcast explaining show signs working. mean used covid. Name three perfectly healthy kids died COVID. someone came pharmacy scabies said ""ivermecton? thought horses....

It really matter, kinda it. Aaron Rodgers huge douche. comes one people thinks smarter everyone else throws obscure words prove it. 

He honest reasons getting vaccinated taken backlash.  FTP taking actual HORSE MEDICINE.

People like keep insisting deliberately obtuse, saying ""others"" misunderstanding. Stop trying gaslight people, least honest.  launched early stay long...  sister law last night 2 year old child come Cat Scan room. mother 4 got car accident banged up, baby flew windshield fractured skull brain bleed. mother buckle kid car seat. Even seat belt would've prevented baby flying out. crazy. People taking actual HORSE MEDICINE, human one, ffs.

Why keep arguing point, unless pro-Ivermectin treating Covid, usually = anti-Covid-vaxx.

I'm pretty certain disingenuous (though maybe not) voted oblivion. rightly so. “news” America classified “entertainment” long while.  wear seatbelts driving? Plenty people die wearing it. 

Don't let gov tell do, tear ticket put signs car refuse buckle up.

/s I'm sure hell fine. Takes guts stand fray. Good him. Covid Tests free Children cannot vaccinated. 
They also free symptoms. 

You pay want tested without symptoms unvaccinated need take part many parts daily life.



The vaccine free want get vaccinated thing expect government also pay test.
But that's opinion. People acting like stubborn toddlers point. It’s literally Someone careless health advocating carelessness others kind person want representing brand health/financial security. Yes data US, children. However polio virus virus anywhere. causes asymptomatic infections 70% time, rest mild flu like illnesses. Paralysis serious complications occur small percentage polio infections. threat astronomical— point vaccinate even though bad outcomes rare. need vaccinate children Covid.  clay, ate sand. nobodies fucking business got poke, ever since virus got released got politicized divide people side bat shit. want poke get it, people want that's right also. worded badly. Wish they’d stop using term ‘natural immunity’. mean infection immunity opposed vaccination immunity. understanding infection immunity broader (attacks parts virus) varies widely person person can’t count it, vaccinations reliably invoke immunity.    epitome low information. don’t know anything Facebook memes. Aaron, wear helmet pads? Dummy, you’re still gonna feel get tackled.  Aaron Rodgers broke collarbone yet continues wear pads, curious  wish open honest dialog. Thanks service sharing story. think feel many vaccinated parents. Yeah it’s basically milder less likely happen vaccine. bad anti vax morons don’t get this.   think takes 6 weeks get full booster effects.     people trust celebrities medical professionals    Oh mean like birth certificate? social security number? ID/driver's license? vaccination records need go school? People required papers live since government started. Get cherry-picking.  media outlets agenda...we know that, new thing. problem saying took ivermectin got better implying got better it, proof.  That’s antivax take. ask vaccines “gotcha”. Though that’s vaccines work, generally.     That’s looking contract see. really come wording. I’m guessing since haven’t done yet it’s probably looking good them.  No, Gen Z Millennials overwhelmingly support universal healthcare. age groups aren’t vaccinated. Gen Z slightly higher 40 percent vaccinated. Millenials aren’t much higher. 

The older generations usually opposed universal healthcare 75-80%+ vaccinated. California's population actually increased state since 2010. gone 3 million. half dose time though!  I'm glad them. 


But 1 day irrelevant statistical data. Funny mention - last 3 weeks post booster, trying bench (barbell dumbbell) get weird pinch delt close injection site. sure it’s coincidence it’s driving nuts.   said, Japan long history vaccine avoidance. due adverse reactions vaccines 1970s 1990s.
But case, period vaccine available delay securing it, many people looked situation overseas thought better get vaccine get seriously ill covid. penalties legal obligations here, end, people wanted vaccinated. Again, emphasis wasn’t claiming works everyone. took got better shortly after. emphasis CNN blatantly lied public. one seems problem comment section though. guess mainstream media dead. unlikely PCR. Hahahaha gotta teenager.

Probably ""religious exemption"" too. got mine friday afternoon, spent yesterday feeling like fucking dying, woke morning little tired sore. sudafed, ibuprofen, carbs took care worst time around, nice, considering second dose knocked ass 3 days nothing helped.

The rate 77.8% first dose 73.1% second dose, second highest among G7 countries number vaccinated people still increasing every day.  AFAIK study conducted using third 100 microgram Moderna. 50 microgram booster we're actually getting. live Tokyo didn’t even remember saw comment. Everything’s back normal Japan almost 80% vaccinated expecting boosters everyone, 4 months ago extremely tense.

We’ve couple storms last weeks would people choosing eat inside instead outside, parties indoors instead going hike friends etc.  leaves 38% fully vaccinated including 5 12 since kids 12 fully vaccinated yet. reading numbers correctly 15% us population 12. whole entire country usually 10% difference first dose vs fully vaccinated people (except 65 community significantly larger portion first dose likely not). Colorado 79% eligible people one dose 72% eligible people fully vaccinated. 


Again, saying dont want much higher vaccination rates, people need pay attention fact vaccination numbers media using Colorado context. rarely hear people speak rates total population fully vaccinated. Colorado low vaccinations rest country need much worried instead blowing ""well bunch unvaccinated people colorado."" #15 country fully vaccinated total population. Seeing spikes high 80% people get vaccine least one dose, scare shit people. Remember thought 70% would enough reach heard immunity?

With injections, know ""for sure"" somebody ingested vaccine; feel confident issued vaccine passport, certificate Covid vaccine whatever. person definitely vaccine inside body. allowing mingle society, enter stadiums restaurants public places seems acceptable.

But virus still replicates body evolve.   ppl hear complaining covid flu, big deal, ppl likely havent case flu years Everytime get sniffles 'have flu'. even understand severity flu assume they're achy they've got it. I'll get Moderna time around much deadly covid kids though. still would some, though much, need government.

You categorically say “these safe effective”. 
Are equally safe effective? course not, nobody seems know yet. Knowledge vaccines covid evolving daily. 

Also, even read article? 

“But one say yet whether bout vaccine-induced myocarditis would harm someone’s health year, 10 years, 50. Salmon told wouldn’t support kids’ mandate researchers able rigorously follow kids get myocarditis year two, find related serious health problems.”  State Farm says updog?

Low effectiveness vs symptomatic disease ok hospitalization death. 
Of course ARNm viral vector better access giving third booster dose Pfizer got inactivated virus. Wait learn hospital-acquired MRSA. really farfetched someone say wanna wait out?

Yes. odds severe complications vaccine considerably lower complications covid saying, every person whos vaccinated weird anti vaxxer.

No, un/misinformed.      found Dad doesn’t think filled ICU beds area covid all. Like guess believes majority across country people didn’t come treatments cancer not, procedures appointments got cancelled hospitals Biden’s government. also masks fear mongering don’t actually work. 

Well, got vaxxed, even flu, problem wears mask without word place person requires it. somehow also believes it’s completely overblown, little worse flu deaths. 

He reasonably smart man, whole life. Didn’t go doctor much, firm military, pull boot straps republican, actively evil. 

This new info makes sad really take least 3-4 people life dying he’ll believe. hasn’t happened yet.

Sorry, needed vent. stupid. stupid now? Numbers part though. SF Bay Area we've 80% months many places 90%+ yet still deaths. course make clear I'm trying sow doubt vaccines--just Japan culture generally embraces public health public initiatives. SF Bay Area still mask mandate on, see people pushing boundaries. Many friends still spend lot time home, go downtown areas bars restaurants think pandemic completely over.  extremely low vaccine rate pandemic so... I'd think Republicans would connections Germany anywhere else. Good automod Yeeeesss? much matters? kinds reasons?

For instance, still get Covid die, even vaccinated… Sure, chances much smaller, zero. 

You also cause people die… maybe killing people small thing book, that’s something bigger book… 

Is troll? Give two weeks. definitely lot ppl outrageous reasons getting shot, *really* farfetched someone say wanna wait out?

For example severe allergies many things, including penicillin, one commonly used medicine there. wanna able get kind test first ensure get dangerous reaction; however doctor said something like available. 

Another reason I'm choosing wait due relatives/friends mine *coincidentally* (or not) experiencing side effects still months getting shots (and no, never skeptical shots). 

One hard time breathing going stairs - doctor said nothing shot ""anxious"". One got diagnosed high blood pressure taking shot - doctor said drinking much coffee (even though drinks 1 cup per day decades). Strange stuff. Another numbness/pain leg could barely walk first week getting 2nd shot. Fortunately good still random spasms able walk. weird things happening shot?

Not denying shot works, data there. bad side effects, requiring everyone, even healthy kids low chance dying covid begin with, bit much. Considering young healthy besides allergies, I'm content getting getting tested regularly.

Just saying, every person whos vaccinated weird anti vaxxer.  Israel=the truth???? 55% idiots gotten polio smallpox vaccines, 45% would dead crippled...... would people get tested though they're barred places? daughter 12 Friday got first vax today.

Did local politicians train hire people check vaccines status businesses? Surprised aid businesses compensated extra work. Seems would bigger deal patrons QR code.  vaccinated, really matter? got vaccinated soon could go life covid never happened. also got booster, even protected. I'm Fukuoka too. first time since arriving pandemic took short train ride son asking ride train year now. really nice outside now. hot, cold. local politicians train compensate minimum wage employees verify vaccine cards, especially patrons QR code?  don’t know getting upvoted, conspiracy theory bad one. live Tokyo agree hard get tested, related government conspiracy make Olympics happen. scores elderly here, vulnerable population. Even weren’t testing, hospitalized dead would simply pile up. pain medication comment also unbelievably untrue. low sat levels even weren’t tested, would doctor send home? absurd.  mean, Japan historically vaccine hesitant initial rollout bungled again.

In end worked fantastically everything went well one could hope, like reason doubt early on. really. 89% eligible people Japan least one something like 84% fully vaccinated. include children vaccine approved yet, despite news says, anti-vaxxers incredibly small minority. Also, normalize wearing masks hospitals, even visitors. Even aside covid, there's million things people pass hospitals endanger vulnerable patients.

We really need start recognizing hospitals treated every public space  Imagine bad science think understand things better everyone else.

Also know fact nobody gives shit get go movie not. throw fit movie, 12. IDs voting specifically place poor minority voters can't get IDs, because... Oh, know, they're always free widely available? voting significantly important poor old missing movie. It'll streaming device months, wait.

That said, think spring open tourism. I'm living Japan wish family could visit, making due FaceTime every day. difficult surgery last December another one March year. 

Both absolute peaks COVID area. terrified instances, know what? exception getting anesthesia waking up, mask much possible requested visitors used sanitizer could. 

I marveled finally wheeled car go home would see grown adults masks, trying enter hospital loitering around general reception areas masks getting bitchy security. got Moderna booster last week. nothingburger compared second shot. felt little tired. ...and logic worked wife?   Yes, issues, especially charge volume therefore distance quickly solved now, instead ""10 years"" now, like used hearing.

117763 total:
78277 Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer), 15771 Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson), 9134 Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), 5678 Spikevax (Moderna), 5585 combination Vaxzevria/Comirnaty 977 combination Vaxzevria/Spikevax. 2.341 breakthrough infections without information type vaccine. also effectively shut doors rest world show signs reopening them. Still pretty good protection. possible eventually people go hospital vaccinated.

Why?

Because A) people vaccinated and/or B) people breakthrough cases severe enough still vulnerable risk sadly. That’s good know. Seattle especially bad King County Health mandate kick. Obviously age matters weight immune system development, skeptical precisely lines drawn... 11yo common 12yo 6yo? wish obviously reasonable inferences allowed create smoother gradient instead big jumps. It’s really simple, yes unvaccinated people fueling crisis, large chunk hospitalizations due breakthrough infections several European countries. 

Hospitalizations European countries actually last weeks, down. distrust western vaccines *even more*. exactly felt. I’ve since cut people want hang half.

Covid (and trump) allowed clearly see feel worth spending time lost respect chose waste another moment on. 

A couple them, known since grade school. It’s eye opening, surprising, saddening. it’s right move without question. hope keeps getting sick friend. Vaccines layers protection. infection. hospitalization, severity. death.  No. Colorado done well compared states far, means there's less natural immunity community alongside vaccines. Therefore there's still lot vulnerable people left. agree everyone vaccinated[0], I'll argue opposite case.

People losing sight goal here. goal managing pandemic minimise harm society whole, reach arbitrary vaccine targets costs.

Immunity leaky, asymptomatic people infectious. Tests (rapid antigen tests) relatively cheap easy.

The people test regularly better. includes vaccinated unvaccinated.

The problem people using tests alternative vaccination small-fry compared problem Germany (along rest Central Europe) finds moment.

[0] - long take moral responsibilities vaccinate third-world seriously well. Eh life SF mostly back normal. masks required offices, gym, fitness classes, churches, etc. long everyone attending fully vaccinated.

That’s way better LA, Vegas, Chicago, DC, etc. Thank you!    People like old*1 man literally basing medical decisions politics see everyone else problem? words.

I’m glad got vaccine though. Hopefully help end like man make less likely spread stubborn old men.


 1* don’t think even near retirement age can’t find article moment can’t say sure. need boosters create antibodies? Especially since should/will get booster every 6 months? 62% total population, fully vaccinated. AKA 15th country category. Colorado average vaccinations always been. dont understand news articles pushing idea low vaccination rates colorado besides easy thing say remove context. think confusing [children dosed 10 weeks 12 hours respectively [adult dosed one month 6 hours respectively. yeah good. what. r/covidlonghaulers


also, anecdotal reports psilocybin helping possible nerve damage relating anosmia/parosmia. doctors prescribing steroid inhalers.

The approach vaccines based risk/reward communities society. Good! feel really bad teachers school administrators take abuse that's coming, though. They've already rough anti-maskers.

It's like childhood vaccinations mostly prevent spread amongst adults. first.

People mostly arms politicized... also increase people believing insane conspiracy theories... pre existing anti vaccines people... China’s population large.

Unless, course, child high risk case receive individual benefit.

The virus totally random. could probably get 99.9% individual benefit vaccinating 0.01% highest risk children. got vaccine, im afraid giving 6 year old 2 year old new kids healthy likely going affected virus. I'm afraid giving something new. took vaccine, wanted to, forced would separated military. boat broke virus vaccine available. boat 130 people onboard 45 tested positive.

Children also susceptible underlying issues, especially vascular, affect later life, well MIS-C. concerns even asymptomatic children.

Children manage get covid shown much contagious adults, means also concern vector spread rest us. Especially school, clumped together, sent home spread others. 

With covid though, concern stopping mutations popping up. also work schedule. second shot knocked day. planned around that. day relax make sure OK work. know people booster. rocked like rocked second shot. Others handled well. vaccine created quickly hasn’t long see long term effects.

Everyone predicted back-to-school would crush us, much country seen decline period. thought might vaccinations took Delta hit. Modelers even best epidemiologists times making guesses.

So naturally, I'm going take guess here.

It looks like Delta wave got really concentrated south Texas Florida, ever since, there's wave permeating two locations. First whole south (who got rocked hard low vaccination rates), mid-Atlantic lower Midwest, upper Midwest mountain area, even see beginning inklings spread California.

I'm kinda stunned places mask mandates instead vaccine mandates. There's logic it. kids get seriously ill night asymptomatic pass CAN'T get vaccinated vaccinated greater risk... Nevermind fast thing mutating. flu vaccine lot less effective. best years, it’s 40-60% effective. bad-match years aren’t unusual lower drastically.

The main covid vaccines around 91% effective young kids. Even higher kids 12-15. last, we've lost many children.... Kansas supervision homeschooling. sign paper saying teaching home state says, okay cool, send kids school anymore.

And never check kid. Almost recognized major religions advocate vaccinations though. live society. know folks going lose minds, fucking love it.

OP post r/NFL please. Execute order 66. January long, it’s still holidays. I’m sorry it’s available kiddos. helped initial disease stopping spread infected. delta variant.

HOWEVER, missing key bit information. Vaccinated people get infected much less often, so, since vaccinated people get infected less often, spread virus less often. yet people saying they're happy get covid jab since cause blood clots. Make mind. 🙄 regional assume?

Half vaccine clinics held churches, half schools, many families would travel miles way get clinics.  even anti vaxxers. Even people others childhood balk idea covid vaxx. research those, research one cus new? Huh?

But I'm sure still get tetanus shot need booster. maybe even flu shot.

Give break. 🤦🏻‍♀️   curiosity, private school local public school policy? qualms requiring COVID vaccine public/private schools. flu shot optional K-12 three states I've lived in. childish. seems like getting loved ones initially vaccinated much easier getting boosted. I’m struggling convince around receive booster. one wants get another dose within months last one. husband received JnJ spring won’t even entertain getting booster unless it’s annual thing. That’s basically opinion rest family well (some Pfizer, Moderna). you, child? Get together act like adult. Israel highest vaxxed nation all. fast vaccinating looked like first get herd immunity first, slowed drastically applying argument actually highest vaxxed countries. actually first case:   work technically eligible booster shot. waiting people really need first. planning 2ish weeks. walk cvs get one. happen link? find anything like that. press releases find said included vaccinated people study.  flu shot mandatory?

the flu dangerous children covid is. live idiot. Look US. Vaccine mandates work - people cry like little babies, protest, moan “rights” 11th hour, vast majority comply. ones don’t place working health care removed long ago. don’t care bring duty doctors, students military reserves, figure protect vulnerable. first rule medicine HARM. cannot unvaccinated healthcare worker lifetime pandemic. Get outta crap. answer question ""are vaccinated?"" started word ""yes.""

After said immunized. could taken another word vaccinated. important thing first response question ""yes."" lied. Plain simple. Good   Shh, tell WHO/FDA though. matters bad outcomes. Goddamnit. vaccinated least?

Get antibody therapies meds immediately. Ask doctor.  spokesperson supporting health care organization's health wellness initiatives...

I know healthcare company would partner football player. specialize neurology concussions? really pay attention china, seeing adverse effects? anything like myocarditis? anything? Haha. Oh autocorrect…   Measles different virus since AFAIK, mutate often covid19. new variants covid19 form, doubt new vax developed rolled fast enough(even mandate) prevent variants. Israel example, we're \*probably\* seeing breakthrough cases variants. I’m sure team doctors would’ve monitored him, NFL bunch cowards didn’t mass vaccinate every single person organization like have.

The NBA pulled bubble season impressive, much stupid happened.  Nah, core objection like trust people recommending it.  USA? horses people need drug actual use. hospitals treat misusing drug. I'm really getting tired whole ""well, people vaccinated still get COVID, bother""

For Rogers: hide behind offensive line? get sacked regardless, bother them

For anti-vaxx police: wearing kevlar? plenty officers died wearing bulletproof vests, bother?

etc., etc. wouldn’t be, I’m fully vaccinated try careful. Breakthrough cases happen.

People go office hacking lung ones feel shame (pre covid now!) exactly ones don’t. Thanks advice. Remote medicine becoming prevalent. could video chat doctor, describe symptoms get prescription mailed without leaving house. true. propaganda work, i.e. everyone get :) Ivermectin sort magic bullet. I'm aware single study indicates anything help clear severe case COVID mandated country? Yay  understanding vaccines use N1-Methylpseudouridine actually increases vaccines safety efficacy.  poor excuse man. Oh good, sounds like obvious solution then! No. doctor determines mature enough understand consent procedure. direct contravention parents wishes patient final say. However limitations, simple vaccines becomes complex procedures.  live DC there's indoor mask mandate yes annoying. packed bar maskless, gym one near you? Lol nope still gotta wear gasping air.

To fair really mind wearing places like metro doctors offices, lack enforcement consistency really annoys me. hope end mandate January. record I'm concerned mask mandates they're required office next week become optional. They're still required indoor public businesses except eating drinking (California). know it’s hard understand, it’s simple labeling everyone antivaxxer. I'd say Q3 Q4 2022, need treatment reach hands EVERYONE, EVERYONE mean EVERYONE.

Please, please, anybody willing take vaccine, FINE, choice. please, get COVID least give treatment benefit doubt. unvaccinated people want take vaccine hospitalizations keep surging restrictions still place 19 months later, decide take vaccine decide take pill either, beyond lost cause. guess effect seasonality vastly underestimated large degree randomness. Makes intuitive sense that, since transmission outdoors ~18x less indoors (think that's latest number I've seen), average temperatures get ever slightly colder, small increase time spent indoors could lead disproportionately larger increase cases.
  
As far randomness goes remember reading one article making decent argument viruses studied parallel with/relates heavily chaos theory. instance, double pendulum (look video youtube) start flipping almost randomly compared another double pendulum started almost starting condition, slight difference. correlation Covid slightly different initial conditions lead vastly different outcomes. even places similar NIP's, vaccination rate, populations etc. may possible merely chance one group gets statistically ""unlucky"" speak (superspreaders, abnormally high (yet statistically accounted for) higher transmission certain situations)) leads different caseload/pandemic trajectories. course compounded week week could accentuate slight initial differences. instead talking hypotheticals, let's look real world examples. Israel 80% vax rate 12yr old population, highest nation. June, several days zero new COVID infections, re-opened(coz hey, covid's cured right?) within 2 months, surge new cases, almost peak. think happened? Worms got rough days. probably can, end well many workers Florida it’s listed anti-viral. I’m physician. human anti-viral utility anyone says quack. Agree messaging complete garbage day one. cdc destroyed trust general public. Finally, yes go get 3rd booster it’s least 6mo, definitely 8mo since 2nd shot saying sitting USA?

If australias rate ""pathetic"" word going use describe USA's? (~57%) Makes sense, kids dying left right shit. saw plowtruck go remove bodies streets. good. Good. childrens' elementary school Connecticut requires flu shot annually.

The COVID vaccine likely become mandated next fall beginning 2022-2023 school year. agree let get sorted out. still think it’s slightly dubious confusing. court acted quickly despite business 60ish days implement believe companies vaccinated testing Jan 4th would require folks start shot series early December. That’s believe emergency injunction.  Makes sense.  Another facet anti-vaxxers ignore. keeping disease alive mutating giving hosts. America doesn’t monopoly idiocy. World wide Conservatism certainly does.  I'd love see numbers/models distribution vaccinated/unvaccinated affects spread. two populations vaccination rate (say, 70%), one 30% unvaccinated mostly distributed fairly evenly randomly, unvaccinated fairly clustered insular, bet infection rates progression look substantially different.  It’s quite concerning, especially “it works great cold flu!” language creeping ever steadily I’m taking quick information request - concerned make mandates around forever detail wear them? I’ve got friend going college fully vaxxed it’s requirement attend still require masks that’s insanity.  It'd PEG 100% lie actually something prevents getting vaccine anyway. becomes day procedure supervision, done definitely afford it. Viruses alive? thought floating husks factories needing hosts produce instructions. mad allergies- anaphylactic shock multiple times, works. felt like total shit 4 days second shot, nothing alarming. interviewer nurse treating dying unvaxxed COVID patient man, fucking deathbed, said doesn’t regret taking government wasn’t trying force to, probably would got it. literally didn’t like felt like ordered. proudly, actually dying hill.

On one hand, almost feel bad people must feel control, hand, grow fuck up. states isn’t going problem. Next year it’ll worked schools vaccine requirements year. People either vaccinate kids homeschool it’s simple. anti-vaxx crowd already lol. 

I pro school vaccine mandates, employers deciding mandate, hell even okay shit NYC done local level. I’m federally mandated anything.   submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

Of course Screeching Lunatics Reason Ignored make fuss hey. Fuck people, parents. said ""immunized,"" would've told everyone mean vaccinated, one asked question ""critical thinking"" kept himself.

Then said lie status, hilarious even bother claiming immunized think matter? knew would look bad vaccinated right: people like douche bags pro-pandemic. many listening Joe Rogan. varies greatly throughout states country though. county, jail deputies start 32 hour plenty optional OT, correction officers (state DOC prison) start around 21 hour nearly triple amount people custody. crazy understaffed though.

Chinese government ignore allow outbreaks Ruili spread rest China, would disaster, strict controls one town. Half workers I've seen supermarkets wear masks all. worst gas stations, I've never seen single worker wearing mask there. even one. Lewis appears fit, physical demands F1 widely underestimated, NFL linebackers average 6'2"", 244lbs

No need exaggerate neighbor tell willing get booster J&amp;J shot, got brain fog first one. told well known side effect getting covid too, risk getting covid getting worse? guy months ago quit drinking 20 years heavy tequila drinking, he's blaming shot brain fog. NTM smokes copious amounts weed every day well. I'm still going keep bringing try talk getting booster, boyfriend one time, may able convince again.     Front page Covid tab Twitter right shows segment saying ""COVID-19 vaccines effective natural immunity, CDC fact-checkers say"" 

Is blatant misinformation? almost overwhelming evidence natural immunity par slightly better regards vaccine-induced immunity. least statement provided cannot claimed black white without doubt misleading.
  
Obviously safer acquire said immunity via vaccination, boggled intentional dismissal immunity acquired via infection. purposely suppressed encourage vaccinate? thing think of. Vaccines cost saving measure. 1300 people die every day, stayed around 1 month ICU. cost 1 million dollars. cost billions vaccines (not trillions, they're pricey), reduce costs overall. amounts pain, stress risk 

It's completely quantifiable studies monitor this. far risk nearly nothing significantly lower COVID itself. 680 children died pandemic USA would lived gotten vaccine. provides protection, immunity, nature vaccine. We'll make decision year's time boosters needed.  see herman cain awards real cancellations….. true all. live too, took care homeless people past privately, I'm homeless also know statistics P7 well. prove point society blinds homeless people.

Fun fact: city counts homeless people officially registered homeless. possible lot people (like immigrants, especially refugees asylum status can't go back home country), even know really works. post address enough, need Meldeadresse well.

Also, diseases vaccines deadly kids. COVID isnt. 

Not yet. keep letting COVID run rampant, eventually going mutate something deadly. Also, kids still carry parents parents die -- 140,000 kids U.S. lost parent caregiver, many lost parents. great little Timmy die COVID, bet he'd happier Also, dont need indefinite amount shots, 

You mean like yearly flu shot half population U.S. gets every year? act like vaccines newfangled thing know anything about. dozen vaccines practically every child gets turn 2 years old, several require boosters every lets even get risk myocarditis.

The risk myocarditis COVID greater risk myocarditis COVID vaccine. one study supposedly linked COVID vaccine myocarditis retracted. TIL: sometimes, jocks aren’t smart. That’s impressive amount horse shit managed pack poorly written sentences. Kudos. Even legalized states growing plants, possessing 1.5 ounces public, selling amount without license could get felony.  all. 

the covid vaccines real vaccines
polio, smallpox etc vaccines real, make completely immune forever
the covid ""vaccine"" medical treatment similar influenza injection shots change every year

if mandate kids covid shots they're going getting shots every half year, means trillions profit manufacturers.
you subjecting children unquantifiable amounts pain, stress risk gigatrillionaires get even richer. immoral every level, disgusting excuse parent support it. local county (in US) 75% full vaccination rate, publishes complete detailed stats. last two months vast majority hospitalizations deaths COVID among unvaccinated. Among vaccinated, hospitalizations deaths (still 40× smaller rate compared unvaccinated) among 60+ old.

In short, county, nobody younger 60 died COVID vaccinated. among seniors, 40 times unvaccinated died vaccinated ones. ""Do know many seconds next birthday is?

Re vaccine versus regeneron. One cheap preventative. One expensive used early window positivity people don’t know COVID yet. vaccine also full FDA approval used exponentially people without serious illness whereas regeneron emergency authorization much small pool participants study.

I think says culture anything else, good.  always hate argument


That's argument. presented like one, like gotcha, nobody ever claimed vaccine 100% keep someone contracting Covid. strawman. Yeah logic anti-vaxxer bad. feel like 8-year old could explain flawed logic can't see it.

Makes worry educational system. Breakthrough infections thing, though common. know precisely one circle friends: friend mine second covid, fully vaccinated Moderna. Fever, cough et. al, plenty symptoms.

She owns underground (literally) bar, exposed infection strangers worse way us. know sounds low, context nice 3 bed 2 bath home city paid $90,000 rent $925 month, 15 acre farm live cost $65,000.

I pro police either, know lot shitty cops. Still, plenty good ones trying job professionally honesty, without malice, trying earn living. know short term effects covid. That's enough me. 

I've gotten 3 shots far. &amp; recommend another booster I'll one 1st line. There’s many possible reasons. makes logical sense spreads 80% less less 50% likely infected first place multiplied smaller % less likely spread get it. adds Bayesian way. Sorry bad news USA it’s hard find truth. ‘Hail Mary’  Good also wonder kids get Covid develop related virus next several decades. Personally chicken pox, need get vaxed shingles 50. son got chicken pox vax he’s protected shingles. I’d suspect wily viruses hiding body decades, Covid may pop back form future bodies survived it. guess. believe risk COVID real reason, right? maybe doctors scientists determined real? doctors scientists also recommend vaccine, they? Yeah,""100 billion times brighter hospital X-ray"" sounds concerning   Rodgers try make argument? mentioned anywhere article. going say even 21 seems really low me.

I really pro police person anti police either. think improvements made. True jobs professions however. job pretty darn stressful... Especially stuff going sideways. 

I firm believer want last one ship. huge corporations institutions basically learn everyone 'votes' feet.  feel like it’s reason men die heart attacks, women get men usually wait longer request medical attention many infection already severe time seek help.

Non-essential businesses simply closing doors willfully unvaccinated would solve lot problems. certainly technology make happen, strongly suspect even folks choose lose jobs rather get vaccinated would rethink stance meant could never go pub theater concert amusement park again.

OSHA Constitutionally created Congress 1971, delegated authority make workplace safety laws time. They’ve authority 50 years (you could even argue it’s around longer, BLS, created 20s).

COVID, would safe see Thanksgiving? would 3 weeks first noticed symptoms. toddler young get vaccinated, CDC website says getting positive test need isolate 14 days.

EDIT: vaccinated  numbering root common misconception, I'm sure know. G logarithmic scale, 5G actually *ten* *times* louder 4G. theater this? Well may choice while. Healthy staff come work keep patients healthy. Unvaccinated staff get sick, spread sickness coworkers patients. kiddo turns 12 next week debated waiting. Talked pediatrician ultimately started vax yesterday. 

We far less stressed that's worth world us both.  impressive part wrong many different aspects comment. sniffles aren’t worth living compromised. Sorry man. Masks miserable. wear required to, thankfully transportation only.   Protecting parents make poor choices. Yeah said wasn’t even controversial. stated many people claimed success taking ivermectin relation COVID. didn’t realize controversial whole subject commented tbh. don’t care someone wants get vaccinated not, problem vaccine mandates assumption getting vaccinated one cure. like free ride already late. community. ambulances part fire district free anyone everyone. Costs people city $6 year property taxes. Proved useful wife hit car parking lot. I'm tired people saying vaccine keep us safe dying matters. Even mild covid cause profound damage bodies. good. Well..there go. State 73% instead 55, we'd hardly anyone dying too.  Everyone really really nicely telling get now. get breakthrough case booster could protected day putting many others risk process. people pass along to. sooner better.     truer words spoken, !!! yet cities perpetually stuck Covid mandates. It’s frustrating. know getting downvoted pretty mysterious. country went tens thousands cases 3-400 cases day fast maybe except Taiwan. taiwan much smaller population. singapore korea getting vaxxed masking cases controlled like japan. even NZ australia's cases going also. vaccination rate 77.8% vaccinated 73.1% completed second dose. second this, especially working within hospital  Never really understood americans act like immature kids, like told  much sniffle 2 years. fuckers would keep masks would great. Covid Natural Selection Steriods .....No jab .... Gotcha ! getting overturned already.   Like rain wedding day… I’ve following Covaxin long time.. give kids vaccine. one would pick. It’s super safe, doesn’t serious side effects others. hope Canada approves soon. Ocugen applied EUL back think Canada didnt want respond approved WHO. safe healthy community cool fuck.  lol? Yeah excitement get boosters odd site one.  I’m ready go back gym next week I’m going gym shopping. gym doesn’t check status, I’ll turn around leave. lot health clubs care money health. make quick easy distinguish.  Yeah maybe vaccine J&amp;J. 

But still J&amp;J nothing times quadrillion. choosing get it’s “Wendy’s” shots dumb, contributing narrative based reactionary fear people understand nothing virology, biology, biochemistry immunology called fearmongering. Especially *actual* chances something bad happening are, like said, equal struck lightning. 

Anyway, facts there. reply dumb argument won’t reading cause block people like you. Good luck. Identical last year. Compare peaks. goes south midwest north west mountain back Midwest south  kiwi's laid back people, ok? take time things. rush us, we'll get eventually.   I’m actually surprised it’s higher that. It’s lies fear mongering though. think pretty much medical professional would pick vaccines J&amp;J. Doesn’t help recent fuck up. [15 million fucked    shit. That’s point. point original comment said calling ivermectin horse dewormer “misinformation” “just bad” anti-vaxxers  Well it’s name totally ignore foundational pieces US governmental structure. must aware polio vaccine 4 doses children DTP 5 doses. adults get TDaP booster.  


But vaccine benefit isn’t measured many doses takes, it’s measured morbidity mortality prevented. Distribution maintain shelf life would require education, yes, appears something like pill form monoclonal antibody preventative treatment like this, exactly this, could used way. make ass Uma Thurman. heard of. /r/pharmacy talk code they're identified chain work for. Retail pharmacy pushes fill many scripts possible, consider skills knowledge. much people think pharmacists count pills work cash registers. question vaccine beneficial (it ) . risk children high enough mandatory one. ( opinion either way). valid question ask parents . divisions regional. They're largely urban/rural. Vaccines don’t make claims, every study looking transmission shows substantially less transmission vaccinated people unvaccinated. Vaccinated people less likely infected begin with, people infected don’t transmit. vaccinated get infected, shed virus shorter period time fewer people exposed.  Chicken pox probably spreads fast disrupts school year . 2-3 weeks home isolation whole classes required vaccinated . think schools mandate avoid logistics headache , outbreak inevitably. &lt;eye Positivity rate 1% well. They’ve done great job getting control. require legislation every rule OSHA implements. would completely impractical.  CV$ Walgreen$ care employees handle. Overall going fine. know three people lost parents. One lost dad mom within weeks. overall going okay. worried health, get shot. There's also pill two companies. Covid going anywhere. eat better, exercise continue live life. Pfizer got Pfizer booster yesterday full dose kicked ass today less ethical doctor prescribe could challenge


You think celebrity worth hundreds millions dollars helps this? Yeah bet. Logic reason tough competitors lies fearmongering. gotten around it. Luckily symptoms bad though, mild flu like. Mostly sleepy. Anything 99.5% anywhere Facebook YouTube’s faults people downvoting must really hate eradicated polio gotten disease numbers low negligible modern health advances vaccine mandates. Sucks weak toddlers aren’t dying measles anymore. ^/s mean like it’s schools summer camps youth retreats decades? really know better omit sarcasm tag. nothing it, acting like shortage vaccines think quite opposite, plenty covid shots go around 89.31% first dose.
95% figure recon end at.. still need drag morons along vac hub get there.

They going open 5+ Christmas approval process goes well, I’m convinced see 95% small children vaccinated, probably different numbers going around  article dumb, covid shots one things shortage of, able schedule covid booster several places within couple days ended going Walmart able get shot day said one taking covid pretty clear that. Energy Recovery Ventilation really standard new houses, pandemic not. lets keep house constantly ventilated time keeping warm/cool. research.  Colorado’s testing 7-8% samples genetics. Nothing report front yet.  That’s true state Victoria (270 days), New South Wales (was locked 100), state locked ten since initial April20 lockdown.

The states virtually Covid free since may 2020. Life like 2019 except 2 3 day lockdowns whenever mystery case arose could track source.  Good Rugged individualism thee  believe things changed quite bit delta variant. reject mean prevent immune response mRNA itself, (thus breaking chance manufacture spike proteins,) opposed spike protein mRNA meant produce, yes. Making sure doesn’t happen would definitely effect stated last post. one gotten polio vaccine 30 years viruses practically irradiated mention pose major danger 18, COVID suppose you’ll get mad horse disease. Where?   put others risk? vaccinated? called hero last year though? fix everything? vaccine, unlike something like Tylenol instance, based weight, maturity immune system. What’s more, chicken pox vaccine required schools grew well decades old. That’s interesting, Australia don’t mandate chickenpox. paid kids pocket anyway though flu vaccine Lot less effective covid vaccines. 40-60% good year get strains right, far less bad ones.

I’m looking forward studies Moderna combo seasonal flu+covid booster they’re developing, I’d like see effective flu.  many polio killed US last two years? Measles? Mumps? Rubella? stop vaccinating well? Fox News yesterday first broke asked people vaccinated take pills said didnt recommend it....but possible could changed yes, Im seeing specifically asked answered either. suppose we'll see develops :)  make many appointments per day can't handle all?  bet leave kids alone night wrong part Chicago. 68% 0% data far seems indicate contracting covid much likely long term side effects getting vaccine. either chiro worse.

There's worse chiro? honest would good idea individual roll small pox inoculation Washington mandated. I'd taken 2.5% chance death get inoculated mitigate \~33% chance death catching small pox. vaccine dilemma feels like really simple risk analysis question, like Jr High level, many people getting wrong, there's really one right answer. lot ""hesitants"" know misinformed. honestly worried risks associated it. feel bad them. hospitalized COVID. president say would easter hoax? think really additional fallback layer protection: said another post, think Covid vaccine seatbelts molnupiravir airbags car. car airbags (which technically called ***Supplementary*** Restraint Systems) mean skip wearing seatbelts. Two doses yes pull would stupid. people can’t get mRNA due PEG. also doesn’t seem cause myocarditis risk people.  coworker like this. Double masks religiously she’s terrified getting COVID-19. doesn’t go restaurants, curbside everywhere, etc. get vaccinated. She’s afraid long term side effects. husband kids vaccinated won’t it. 50 states DC require varicella vaccine enter public school kindergarden.

All 50 DC also require DTaP IVP.

All Iowa require MMR, Iowa still requires measles &amp; rubella (excludes mumps)

All Alabama, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont require HepB.

There state requirements, they're common.  It’s prevent body rejecting foreign mRNA. That's funny Trump doctors told get vaccinated...

I suspect ""Facebook memes"" option poll, would ranked highest.. Wow hadn’t even thought that! I’ve several visits doctors never know look like without mask on. even major surgery one. 😅😅 erday.

Lazy ass.  think guy worth hundreds millions dollars taking paste meant horses pill meant humans? ever taken doxycline, prilosec Benedryl? animal medications too. There's nothing unique Ivermectin used across species. think right distinction viruses diseases. expand that? ….and right push people take vaccines polio smallpox measles mumps rubella pertussis 5 4 3 2 1 think traditional inactivated virus vaccine would appealing ""vaccine-hesitant"" people freaked mRNA. would achieve protection hospitalization death ENTIRE POINT cool, he's got Dr Rogan top medical advice. ""Victim cancel culture"" 

Aaron, made choice get COVID vaccination lied it. Yup, culture canceled. would work... Once. Moving forward, nobody would start research vaccines knowing might end nationalized. 

There hundreds vaccine prototypes failed, many cost tens millions dollars investments lost. also many vaccines successful, EUA'd others beat market. needs incentive companies (and investors) try develop new medicines, quickly.

And, frankly, worked. Ask yourself, offered Moderna Russian/Chinese state developed alternatives, would pick? Pfizer/Biontech, Moderna, etc developed product people wanted incredibly effective incredibly safe. financially successful, others try same. like good old, ""i'm racist, but...""  people high risk allergic reaction, get micro doses vaccine administered regular intervals monitoring (so get one dose slowly course hour two). Here's nuanced thought process. 

The opioid epidemic created wake literal letter editor billed rigorous evidence mu-kappa receptor agonists addictive due dysphoric effects kappa agonism. People early 90s question it, regulations place handle it. could walk doctor's office, say back pain, get 30mg oxy three times day 90 days refills. led crisis we're still now, studied rigorously, regulations put place, we're working backpedaling it. 

Worthy noting, largely perpetrated Sackler family Perdue Pharma, neither involved development covid vaccines.

Covid vaccines, contrast, developed extremely rigorous, open data, peer reviewed circumstances, efficacy verified countless third party studies point. n doses administered *billions*, side effects remaining infinitesimal, especially compared long term side effects contracting covid, actually still learning about. mRNA technology medicines development 25 years, mechanism within immune system extremely well described.

The comparison either completely disingenuous ignorant science history underlying them. logical fallacy false equivalence. HAHA good luck that.

OSHA authority health safety workplaces. quite literally name.

Don't want get vaccinated? Stay workplace. Easy enough. reeeeeeally don’t understand metaphors huh  Yes requires prescription. idiots getting horse version need prescription  Imagine someone holds healthcare professionals contempt. mean wow, that's just... foreign me.

I get it, healthcare experiences go poorly even best intentions, healthcare professionals literally group people _might_ able help cheat death.

I got booster yesterday too! challenge OSHA’s authority. plaintiff’s saying, among things, Congress cannot delegate level authority executive agency. argument mandate broad must done legislative action going fine.

So four people know personally died COVID far... go tell families they're going fine? I'm sure they'll relieved. might want get refund funeral costs though; tricky. necessarily think echo chamber situation...more like people sensitive religious beliefs lumped together conspiracies (however valid comparison is). 
I agree assertion people right believe things objectively, provable untrue however, right idiot allow act idiocy way endangers health safety others. It’s best. agree basic ideas putting forward, think belief good bad luck harmless (depending far take it).

For example, person dismisses things ""just bad luck"" ""just good luck"", could end failing investigate important issues. Sometimes things *seem* like good bad luck actually happening reasons, important know reasons are.

Additionally, lot beliefs connected idea ""luck"" contribute people losing significant amounts money gambling.  wish people thought ripple effects policy choices. Mandating COVID-19 vaccines kids hyperpartisan mess politicize mandating vaccines way medically important kids. medical benefit vaccinating kids pretty marginal since extremely low risk. partisan rejection vaccination general would much worse them.  Dumbasstrodamus NFL needs grow pair actually suspend season putting everyone risk continuing takes horse de-wormer.

A long time. see fact prior 50s I'll knowledge microbiology different. 

If develop polio vaccine today would completely different question. 

Anyway anyone wanting know story today technical well written Heck yeah! get one annually. people know well. Different area guess! Good, I’m sick bullshit  No, don’t agree.

Even ‘God’ fact real indeed tell murder firstborn, would still morally wrong so. act moral violation belief itself. know Aaron Rodgers' medical history. He's going fine. going fine. Biden's advisor says going get Covid eventually. true. everyone got vaccine, still going live it. want get it.  feel bad children, like situation children neglected. fault. “People regular mask-wearers vaccinated placed significantly higher trust doctors, hospitals, scientists, government compared respondents unvaccinated; latter ranked former president Donald Trump nearly par hospitals doctors.”  need piss pants it. We’re friends here. You’ve told people created opiate problem country. sudden trustworthy? Like stated, wife vaccinated, let’s pretend told truth. Might be, full report also showed way afraid friends family getting COVID fully unvaxxed unmasked group. friend recently tell friend anti-vax terrified COVID makes everyone masks distance hang out. thought nut apparently widespread.   state mask mandate, hear COVID news, family talks COVID schools socially distanced around me. mean end pandemic return point need make sacrifices anymore. Family gatherings hard half family scared covid half care all, half scared want meet up, lot happening Covid.

I'd love go day hear it.  agree that. 
 
I understand level certainty regarding lack potential mutations evade vaccine. breakthrough infection could mutate new variant vaccinated person, viable mutation could trend away immune system's capabilities, no?

As far ""leaving out"" information, we're reading article, states rise infections double-vax, hence started 3rd booster shot campaign.

Now, replied post argue vocab, may, shown credible sources(or actually ad-hominem) show vax stops transmission delta variant. 

I never said Israel herd-immunity, assumed did, labelled never said misinformation.

And far using information 2020, I've updated OP date data CDC child mortality COVID figures still low compared rest age groups.

So may feel like adult use insults someone internet, actually asking legit question spur critical thought. power sir.. How’d BlackRock do, Vox? large percent population unvaccinated, increasing spread already contagious variants, furthermore, fully reopened. vaccine proven 95% effective prevention. breaks - would rather 5% chance catching covid, 50%, would choose? Aha! Ford says Ontario. New York Times arguing months China let virus spread, like countries.

This article, misleadingly titled, ""Life Covid-Zero China,"" actually experience one relatively small border town China. representative situation rest China. China, life mostly normal since Summer 2020.

One China's top public health figures, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, recently gave interview explained country maintaining zero-CoVID strategy 2022. clips translated English,  one antibody rule all! kids, important since that's talking here. One disease (primarily) childhood disease. Covid not. context mandating vaccines children, really disingenuous compare death illness rates disease primarily effects children vs one primarily effects elderly least older population.

I say parent soon vaccinated 10 year old. Colorado blue. purple. governor hands right now- compared say California statewide mandates. counties mandatory shcool public building mask mandates don’t. deliberately sabotaging population-see Douglas County.  vaccines mRNA? vaccines released emergency authorisation? hold someone liable harmful side effects vaccines? child left life long heart problems covid vaccine suffers blood clots, hold liable? logic waiting 2 weeks Thanksgiving. winter surge started. holidays. planning around boosted them. county one lowest transmission rates country. go stores see probably 75% people masked. know died might well hold moonbeam hand.

Measles gone now, allowing gives government health insurance much power. next? 2 babies, must get sterilized health coverage? insurance company want keep paying prenatal visits, delivery, 25 years dr appointments offspring, oh man health condition? Yeah, cap 2. insurance company enough control already 
covered. able dictate live life too. 

What child cancer can't vaccinated? Insurance gonna drop cause vaccinated well cancer treatment pricey....yeah, sorry. Since child vaccinated going drop coverage.

This part affordable health care act. can't pick can't covered, like decisions.  That's good finally declare actual terrorist organization training camps. data unvaxxed cases vs breakthrough cases? 🙄 basically got participation trophy.  ""Some best friends vaccinated!"" Seems like downside longer time interval would counted unvaccinated something go wrong. Unless official definitions line best empirical practices. Yes someone explain surge happening? Looks like almost 70% pop fully vaccinated yet cases “exploding”. easy answer delta + waning vax efficacy? Exactly right. completely self-induced. Prior he'd done excellent job keeping mouth shut -- allowed respected liked people across political spectrum. more. well done, thanks crunching numbers. suspect, like you, CIH releases revised numbers December costs gone due Delta. 

Small nitpick 700 probably USD average cost CAD. Health Canada pretty good negotiating drug prices though, probably bad starting point:)

Even though think based numbers it’s pretty compelling case (especially given societal impacts) maybe screening tools try hit ones likely sickest (where costs upwards 50k) opposed shotgun.

Air pollution particulate matter (PM) associated SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, although mechanistic studies lacking. tested whether airway surface liquid (ASL) primary human airway epithelial cells antiviral SARS-CoV-2 229E-CoV (responsible common colds), whether PM (urban, indoor (IAP), volcanic ash) affected ASL antiviral activity. ASL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 229E-CoV. Independently, urban PM also decreased SARS-CoV-2 229E-CoV-2 infection, IAP decreased 229E-CoV infection. However, combination, urban PM impaired ASL’s antiviral activity viruses effect occurred IAP ash SARS-CoV-2, suggesting PM may enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection.  hope not, that's cause, idea covid pills rather vax, might right approach treatment EXACTLY...thats clueless/selfish are.
