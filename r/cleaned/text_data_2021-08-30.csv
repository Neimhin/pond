The Los Angeles City Council month voted direct city attorneys draft law would require people least one dose vaccine visit indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, shops movie theaters. plan finalized, proposed law still needs approval full council.

Demonstrators various political stripes targeted L.A. politicians homes last 18 months. angry face masks rules requiring businesses close doors held regular protests last year outside Getty House, official residence L.A.'s mayor.

Vaccination goal itself; merely means end: reducing disease burden much humanly possible. According Desantis peak never existed.

Dude I‚Äôm sorry. didn‚Äôt think anything could worse district damn, insanity. decline? anti-mask identify mask wearers. soon stop falling divide conquer tactic. Amazing testing reviewing doses

That's literally FDA does. live Ft Worth. daughter one ten kids wear mask school. suck. want believe it. seeing ""this peak, go lower"" every day weeks live east coast district held meeting day school started (8-10) voted 3-2 mandating masks. number infections grown exponentially (shocker) number quarantined sketchy district reports twice week tell it‚Äôs sliding number last report (dated 8/24/21 - 8/26/21) 4,000 quarantine.

But yes data Ontario looks good. ...................... positive parts story?

I mean.... what?

Kids‚Äô biology different though developing brains organs, fuck up, like 100 million people ‚Äúvaccine hesitant‚Äù today. Amazingly, yes. Imagine worst people know sorta ok via AirBNB rentals 2017-2020. they‚Äôre mad now. That‚Äôs Kid Rock demo. Nudist here. Although many club go anti maskers anti vaxxers, wear minewith pride, nothing else. Actually I'm pretty shocked stance. always assumed liberals. No, not. anywhere close releasing delta booster. trials happening. wait around reason would really like better idea timeline ‚Äúmid-winter‚Äù. 5-11 group, age groups. 

And vaccines. Children 12 ineligible vaccines, also ineligible many treatments (such Remdesvir monoclonal antibodies) become seriously ill.  information great - thank much! 4 accounts level 40 Darkrais level 40+ Mega Houndooms ""solo"" Lugia. Thanks, though exactly experience. really accomplish much. accomplish priority. Surprise: hospital admissions decline hospitals full can't imagine point vaccine harmful disease that's causing permanent lung heart damage children.

Not blaming. Providing relevant statistic correlation.

We're pretty great, know, know. Please hold applause. Please remind me, President again? thread full people lying get booster makes wonder reliable updated vaccination totals are. Freedom Freezers! don‚Äôt even know fast food places dining room first place. want atmosphere table, go actual restaurant, otherwise *wouldn‚Äôt* take food home? Local McDonald‚Äôs opened dining year feel like chump that? next variant civilization threat.

Call TVA! Yep, keep dumb asses wearing masks getting vaccinated they'll end wiping us out. Reddit: ‚Äúso yeah go different county say it‚Äôs first dose‚Äù well Moderna 3x dose, correlates. Pfizer 30ug shot 1 2. Moderna 100ug first shot, 50ug second shot.

For me, 3 Pfizer. 3rd shot side effects pretty much par 2nd. good immune reaction, feel like job pretty well. Pfizer's initial booster data July indication, get 500-1000% boost antibodies/titers. message brought American association monoclonal antibodies, Super PAC even reason wear masks. simple. countries report lot. weird while. Earlier year, wife pregnant, pregnant women high risk group given priority access, yet also told take yet.  Looks like concept Taco Bell MN going maximize this: Oof, sounds brutal newborn. YMMV course didn‚Äôt bad side effects second shot either. got moderna FWIW.  firmly believe people want feel safe wear mask, follow public health guidelines, get vaccinated (which Pfizer approved FDA). don‚Äôt think concessions made people don‚Äôt want follow rules. 

Like said deserve feel safe, majority elected follow said guidelines feel safe vocal minority choosing to. 

Where proof full vaccine slated become mandatory entrance non essential places like bars, movie theatres, gyms think great. Make choice follow guidelines get vaxxed freedom make call. sympathy can‚Äôt partake. 

Online learning would better call refused follow.  17 year olds Gen Z Common sense, really. rapid testing every day. sounds like two made right decision, retrospect, given knew time (working COVID ICU, yikes!!).

However, risk exposure women far, far lower that, get hesitant. Unfortunately, order herd immunity something like COVID-19, total population immunity needs like 75-85%. Well, happens treat global pandemic like flu scientists people take rights away. 

Just word wisdom - no, can't shoot virus scoped AR-15. Thanks. That's plan. Wish we'd got going sooner is.

There's pretty strong community spirit regard Covid general here, hoping translates really high vaccination coverage rate. We've got dumbass antivaxers like everywhere else they're fairly small minority. Don‚Äôt forget they(Tampa Bay) dumped millions gallons toxins bay year. seems unlikely vulnerable people vaccinated high levels. true people FL died COVID margin Desantis by? might biggest miscalculation history Canada politics, well golden L call early election. Plus one million snowbirds.  really understand distinction all? pattern that... Isn‚Äôt average 68% full?  far know likely asymptomatic. never heard less likely catch it. Also, Delta Covid 1.0 That's good news. Hopefully smaller percentage anti vax idiots pleatau much higher level. Cool much cost?  100% sure one U.S. going propose pregnant women put death didn‚Äôt get vaccine. I‚Äôd genuinely amazed could find legal precedent would state otherwise. decently till delta it.And seeing Delta wrecking havoc across world see bad month half first get variant India That's definitely strange! Everything State made seem like something wanted pregnant women get. know first got pregnant earlier year suggested starting 2nd trimester, again, sometime March iirc. Perhaps seems like less pregnant women don't. seems like information told differently depending state living in. I'm NJ we're awful amount positive cases coming in. referring one dose 75%. Given high case count early pandemic looking partial immunity well 80+%. that's enough permanently return normal, see ever even 85% vaccination outside everyone eventually getting covid becoming endemic could years.

(Don't want come anti-vax mask anyway btw death rates spiked much country this, studies Israel showing much vaccine wanes compared immunity prior infection pretty depressing. world never vaccinated New England today much hope regard. Countries like India Pakistan going giving boosters every 6 months perpetuity) think masks stop spread people take get home spread families friends. I've noticed people taking soon get indoors Thailand. Mask mandates work well we'd like, MASKS do. (Sorry know italicize mobile) I‚Äôm so, sorry loss. getting many people vaccinated possible, we'd hopefully end rejoining rest world endemic Covid, fraction deaths ongoing medical problems caused long Covid unvaccinated people. Still though, NZ ~350 fully-staffed ICU beds entire country, suspect even open localised restrictions whenever number cases gets high enough low percentage needing hospitalisation threatens reach capacity. medical system cannot handle *any* disease getting hand.  Walgreen's tightened distribution. able get third shot Walgreen's Biden's announcement time could convince elderly mother go third dose, told us no. Man, job must hard. I‚Äôm religious person grandmother died, hospital chaplain/priest (I‚Äôm sure which) kind family lead religious family members prayer honestly really help mentally. great amount appreciation people kind thing. Amazing Kerala declared victory last June well vaccines started manufacturing :( go stop whining.  ‚ÄúFlu Season‚Äù caused global migration patterns largely disrupted. might see much flu season year.

Your options are:
Is worth risk getting 101 degree fever 12 hours immune system learns deal suspected pathogen
Or take risk dealing pathogen itself, sick weeks spread (including to... surprise, baby).

Get vaccine. Breakthrough infections specifically people vaccinated show disease symptoms exposure. objectively less risky take less time resolve normal infections, absolutely better baby.

Handled first shot well second shot body went haywire - tingling pain extremities, all-over bruising, extreme fatigue lasted weeks. still right. doctor said way boosters. people taking Florida's numbers face value? They've already demonstrated willingness skew them. Homeless problems Sat sun always lower Florida releases covid numbers weekly wednesdays every day undercounted cares. need AMC squeeze buy EU  way Florida presents covid data unreliable. updates week wednesdays without accurate count mondays tuesdays order always seem like it‚Äôs decline might be. There‚Äôs also reports covid testing unnecessarily cumbersome get Florida currently. one answer 1918 flu, flu tends accumulate 25 mutations per 10,000 base pairs, year.  generally maintaining 10 mutations per 10,000 base pairs (also mentioned article), although C.1.2 sequences clock that. 

COVID larger genome flu. raw number mutations pretty similar actually. almost two years pandemic. Thankfully, non-binding EU member states make entry requirements (which proven reasonable.) bad non-vaccinated, folks definitely won‚Äôt able travel negative test anymore‚Ä¶ rightfully so. believe passed mark yesterday. Germany roughly 19% population 18 12-18 demographic started vaccinated. one could estimate something around 75-80% adult population already first shot. It‚Äôs good France, Portugal, Spain countries, there‚Äôs room improvement. whole DACH area actually lagging behind neighbours number covid deaths / day 1000 like going line flu (50-60 per day). Vaccines wayy effective flu vaccine really shouldnt anymore 10-20 deaths day honest. one infuriating comments I‚Äôve ever seen Reddit I‚Äôve like 8 years . know trying helpful comes across asinine, pompous touch . 

The original comment short valid critique policy vaccine. told get vaccine return normal again. It‚Äôs insane sign depression could angry that‚Äôs case. 

there isn‚Äôt even great data policy currently effective vaccinated people. literally sleepwalking mask policy shutdowns zero communication daily lives affected expect things change. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating population. 

To take short original comment recommend therapy absurd weird. think need re-examine look things. Covid virus going over. global pandemic forever, always threaten hospital capacity way last winter. 63% US one shot. reaching another 20-30%. likely happen get infected next spring. wont easy avoiding getting this. way another 20% america hold 5 years-I understand portion kids leftover adults get spring 2022 I'm gonna wait see. pattern far data comes Israel, rest world skeptical dismissive, data elsewhere catches up.

I'm sure vaccine schedule going end changing. Hopefully something like Pfizer matching Moderna first dose, larger gap second dose.

Gonna figure out.   [no way vaccine Getting vaccinated safest strategy. got really close spring early summer. Restrictions really went away. idea post received many upvotes even awards, posted it. moderna/Pfizer.

Which side effects linked body making spike protein, linked body's response spike protein? overwhelm hospitals, real concern, especially given increase last winter possible ties seasonality Right now, still areas hospitals capacity. 

Cases currently going down. Bavaria PCR trst 75‚Ç¨ support action. SE michigan delta eta, iota, god knows many new variants (Africa 10% vaccination seem getting better time soon) really never done damn thing mask mandates really joke implemented correctly.  must mask mandate correctly. one here, teachers enforce proper mask wearing. far ‚Äú4‚Äù cases school, one kid literally goes nowhere gone anywhere except school. got school someone came school sick wasn‚Äôt tested asymptomatic. took almost week get test results quarantine class. know cases artificially low. really hope it‚Äôs going better there.

(GISAID data registered 2021/08/27)  
      
Excellent job reporting important news. think made simple typographical error. Delta strains actually caused 8 cases worldwide. 
       
For clarification, US alone, CDC data presently shows Delta lineages caused total 1,002,417 new infections period 7 days, week ending August 14, 2021.

     8 cases Delta strains carrying N501S mutation reported worldwide, first case reported Japan (GISAID registration data August 27, 2021). 
        
*** 
       
Clarification: Presently, United States alone, Data page reporting Delta lineages B.1.617.2, AY.1, AY.2, AY.3-AY.12 caused total 99.1% new COVID-19 infections 7 days, week ending August 21, 2021.  
       
Presently, CDC [COVID Data Deaths, Total Number COVID-19 Cases Deaths US Reported CDC, United Table Total Cases-The United States shows total cumulative count 36,813,312 COVID-19 cases US August 14, total cumulative count 37,824,833 COVID-19 cases US August 21, corresponding 7 days week ending August 21, CDC Variant Proportions page. 
          
Thus, 7 days Aug 14-21, corresponding week ending August 21 Variant Proportions page, US total count 1,011,521 new COVID-19 cases, Delta lineages causing 99.1% new COVID-19 cases, 1,002,417 new Delta infections 7 days, week ending Aug 14. 
     
And, sadly tragically, CDC [COVID Data US presently shows 61.3% U.S. population, age ‚â•12 years over, fully vaccinated, amounting 173,700,607 people US, age ‚â•12 years over, fully vaccinated; 38.7% U.S. population, age ‚â•12 years over, fully vaccinated, amounting 109,660,905 people US, age ‚â•12 years over, fully vaccinated. 
      
Some prominent health officials publicly stated Delta variant U.S. population might need reach 90% fully vaccinated country reach herd immunity. 
      
I wonder whether 90% U.S. population might get fully vaccinated new Delta B.1.617.2 carrying N501S mutation SARS-CoV-2 mutation begins spreading across U.S. population coming days, weeks, months, begins killing 10-25% everyone age 15-35 years. 
     
I think one thing's sure. US predictably best place world SARS-CoV-2 virus thrive, spread, mutate 100 million people age ‚â•12 years seem give dam getting fully vaccinated help end pandemic sooner rather later, perhaps 6, 12, 18, 24, months later.

Hey now, try essential oils, became licensed sell them. also Boss Babes Google certified medical professionals.  ‚ÄúI feel like something supposed today‚Ä¶. ah shit!! kids!!!‚Äù Victoria too. that's NSW unintentionally forced position. Well CDC experts saying wear indoors going places again. least would think would see that. Yes, perhaps even importantly, gives *the wrong people* voice.

Isn't interesting people advocate always happen *the right people*? one ever stands says, ""Yes, please, take *my* voice, know I'm talking about."" plans immigrate there, although really nice place really nice people.

That said, yes, I'm sorry break fantasy rest world incredibly jealous NZ. still find people jealous though, therefore allowed country. tell lies, sure. liar harms others usually consequences. liar position authority, worse orders magnitude. People dying believe preachers

You described religion. Shall ban religious talk harmful lie? science follow. Pregnant women specifically excluded trials, legitimately know happens fetus. Like said, can't even cheese pregnant, lukewarm messaging ""pregnant people told can't get vaccinated, also told either"" help much.

When recommended Thalidomide following science too. architects trials included pregnant women high risk group. probably infected bit got first Pfizer. say meningitis, thought first. books local library right contain TONS misinformation. Heck, probably books SHELF contain misinformation.

Do support banning books local library?

Do support local authorities come take books they've decided contain misinformation bookshelf?

Why ""everything goes"" kind thing?

PS - Internet long born, back much ""everything goes"" kind thing. many people that? Thank you! people saw amount people side effects could get alarming.

Why would alarming? Serious side effects extremely rare. That‚Äôs sad.

I'm Wisconsin less 10% ICU beds statewide. start anti mask charter school see works them.  know what‚Äôs scarier? pregnant ending vent c-section coma. That‚Äôs scary. Im sorry, heard many pregnant women spreading misinformation misaligned fears regarding vaccine. recall months ago dr Fauci stated logical negative implication pregnant women get vaccine. Many women getting information misinformed mommy groups it‚Äôs extremely harmful. That's plausible, strong enough launch precautionary (i.e. data) round boosters, especially early less effective, discussed CDC slides. Calling people shot #3 months later saying need shot #4, bit rushed get booster fast, would pretty bad vaccination effort. **Despite half Americans vaccinated, COVID new case death numbers worse one year ago.**

One year ago, 7-week average new cases 41,600, deaths 879.

Today, 7-week average new cases 159,000, deaths 1,350.

The silver lining see death rate dropped 2.1% 0.85% past year.

Considering [1% today's COVID cases breakthrough contracted vaccinated individuals, see Delta variant indeed contagious (as far cases one year prior) less deadly (as death rate less half year prior).

Also possibly explaining higher case number fact lockdowns still place time last year. hand, would imagine many contracting COVID today abiding masks, social distancing, quarantine requirements last year. kind washes out.

I guess I'm stunned numbers objectively far worse last year, hear media really harping this, probably could easily contorted detractors support proposition vaccines ineffective.

Agreed, I‚Äôm tired seeing comments like ‚Äúaside masks, life city back normal.‚Äù masks currently normal, grand scheme life not. Also, media gloom doom towards vaccinated people insanity. hearing news need limit gatherings vigilant unvaccinated making angry also feel helpless getting vaccinated meaningful positive impact life.

Pure conjecture part people discouraged getting mine also zero clue increased risk. Yeah, Spain like that: among world leaders vaccine uptake, mask compliance almost universal, incidence well EU average.

In case, definitely ‚Äòvaccine scepticism‚Äô ‚Äòscience denial‚Äô holds us back full recovery.

Thank spotting this.  consider Singaporeans less obese Americans, surprising Definitely. mom virtually side effects 2nd 3rd doses Moderna‚Ä¶ friend slept 36 hours Pfizer shot.

That said, side effects suck, experienced thing you: side effects nowhere 12 hours shot. Hydrating (I used pedialyte powder mixes) helped lot 2nd 3rd boosters. you‚Äôre comfortable Pfizer definitely understand! end day, go what‚Äôs worked far long get vaccinated.

 can't even make stuff up. 

You read here:  ""At least"" six months. never 98-99%. Data Israel indicated anywhere 87-97%, earlier figure probably closer reality due fact earlier lifecycle virus risk parity (vaccinated people likely hang vaccinated people reducing relative exposure risk artificially increasing efficacy). 

That said, whether 80% 85% 90% efficacy, still leaves lot headroom. Boosters approved *today*, especially highest risk. vaccines. Many thrown away partially used expired. infuriating. interval doses Moderna vaccine -- four weeks, versus three weeks Pfizer-BioNTech

It'll interesting see changes countries extended 8+ weeks. looking apparent sticking ""manufacturer recommended"" 21-day interval terrible idea. guess really boils people actually believe voice God? making shit whole lives? 30 something died covid local hospital, apparently denying covid last breaths. lay like that, hard imagine robust antibodies constant exposure actual covid 19, post vaccination. bet twelve fans really upset. ""It actually may difficult us disentangle time, since vaccination impact Delta variant, especially populations know vaccinated earlier time course. see waning last couple months, could really difficult,"" Dr. Sara Oliver, key CDC vaccine official, told panel.

&amp;#x200B;

You're bad anti-vaxxers still massive idiot. vaccines effective. Understood. literature addressing case? talking friend OB, trend noticed specifically massive dropoff second (or subsequent) children.

Which makes perfect sense me. schools closed created exhausting lift parents (at least, parents plop kids front iPad entire pandemic), hell would pile onto that? would think me, would happy make small sacrifice greater good.  actually 2 2,999,999 hope lot anti mask anti vacc Republicans experience this. We‚Äôve got Maradona, fuck yesh Glad part Moderna mafia think want go, get mask protects well, n95 kn95 Bingo. I'm mash range x mil I'm pretty sure idea ""retirement"" long gone get global changes resulting climate crisis. course. vaccines fantastic personally I‚Äôd like safe side give boosters ASAP. 

But also see clearly fda possibly cdc/ACIP feel ‚Äúgone around‚Äù since White House recommending something fda authorized, needs fda authorization occur. assumed/hoped White House communicated Fda impression would foregone conclusion, article indicates otherwise. still think it‚Äôs going happen, it‚Äôs weird look respected people fda resigning seemingly feel cut process. think spelled ""Florida"" wrong. Several people already arrested using fake cards fines steep. Also facing 1 year jail. That's without federal charges could added time.

If get caught selling cards completely fucked. need get kids able get vaccinated, hope youngest able get vaccines soon get close 85% citizens possible. all. lingering back/shoulder issue involved vertebra, ligament, bone. took two sessions hour fixed it. However tons quacks there. *trombone sounds* Mixed doser here, gotta catch em far, 63.1% state‚Äôs population fully vaccinated, according Health Department.

Vaccination rates seem even throughout Hawaii's counties. 

I would imagine average business would overlook verification rather risking losing 37.9% potential customers.  qualify booster simply go pharmacy something get another shot, questions asked?

I'm desperate get booster *now* know how. know, technically, try explain Catholic Christian.    Hospitalization case rate many breakthrough cases become hospitalizations; breakthrough case rate many vaccinated people become cases. They've reported 9359 breakthrough cases vaccinated population around 2.6 million around 0.03%. none us know wtf talking doctors! vast majority us completely unable make rational informed decisions things like this. simply trust best science available time. really kind strange compare threat nuclear holocaust to, like, variety reasons people feeling hopeless days

I also mean rude, genuinely kind feel like ""you're overblowing everything"" takes like generally come people secure well position life Cringe corporate worshipping interesting news!.  Also Northampton happy implemented. 

Getting masking approved SVSD rollercoaster ride dreading discussed future board meetings, especially Captain Q made remarks weekend. question, muscular issues neck? mild case covid January symptoms headaches (one day monster headache felt like needed extra cup coffee time), 2 nights night sweats annnnnnnnnd old shoulder injury started hurting. assume immune system got confused attacked scar tissue, that's I'm curious neck. FWIW got Pfizer (didn't brand shop anything signed first available appointment took had) mildly sore arm. Hey everyone. recovered Covid last January received one Moderna vaccine spring made feel awful (chest palpitations, fever, pain). Natural immunity plus one vaccine dose great protection Covid (from I‚Äôve read)so opted get second shot. access school, work, public events threatened haven‚Äôt second dose. didn‚Äôt antibodies, would get second shot feel I‚Äôm coerced something don‚Äôt want isn‚Äôt necessary time. anyone else situation? I‚Äôm sure do.  romania. 32% vaccinated 1 dose, 25% doses. we're second last, front bulgaria.

&amp;#x200B;

guess who's +50% 7 day average cases nearly two months now? doubling cases every 2 weeks faster? 1300 daily cases, end month we'll 5000. think OK. J&amp;J news lot since ton research moment since EUA US happen 3 months mRNA vaccines. lot world also looking data Israel since able vaccinate large amount population incredibly quickly see well vaccines faring real world settings. 

There studies done right US regarding mixing vaccine ""boosters"" J&amp;J, Pfizer Moderna likely see anything concrete soon. 

I imagine little tricky mix ""boosters"" different companies potential issues immune system interact combination mRNA (Modern/Pfizer) ""traditional"" (J&amp;J/AZ) vaccine. Preliminary reports seem promising time tell. guy pfucking gets Fda authorized immunocompromised boosters. White House announced everyone get boosters 8 months second dose, starting September 20th. authorized fda. They‚Äôre two completely separate things, particularly fda‚Äôs eyes. Antibodies fade time, [you check askscience 

If go numbers (and assuming OP link relevant accurate), X threshold protection original strain, Delta protection 5X. Pfizer would seem give 25x Moderna 50x. antibodies reduce, 6-9 months go half, probably. see Pfizer 12.5x Moderna 25x. still waaay protective threshold, *another* halving period. probably growing desire get booster shots, anyway, heck I'm double-shot definitely want booster next summer so. 

But absolutely right article basically advertising Moderna real context behind it. Fr starters, think there's many actual studies antibody halving times vaccines. Please correct I'm wrong, anyone. long monoclonal antibodies given someone appreciate value ... chalk net win human race. didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlie‚Äù vaccinated people needing masks

I say that. Read wrote. said **lied** masks unnecessary *for everyone*, early 2020. Remember? said unnecessary might cause catch illness hands touch them, making unsafe.

They *knew* lying, deter people buying masks could bought medical suppliers. Instead saying ""we need masks medical workers, use fabric instead"", said ""don't use masks"". single-handedly way stoke flames anti-masker movement anything else.

They back-tracked changed minds often one trusts anymore.

The CDC's policies driven primarily political sway public optics objective science. recent history questionable public policies highlights this. Nice doctored figures Except article today reporting FL changed way collect share data - ""lying"" would say. BIG SHOCK!!!! /S   catastrophe nature... loss life üò™ 
sad days üòû üò¢ Bonnaroo canceled today Theyre gonna constantly keep moving goal posts. first ""its fda approved know safe"" ""the fda cant trusted anyway"" hard adapt live world focused using build profit actually anything to, uh, know, adapt Oh god serious would lockdown issued stay home order help flow case loads hospitals.. 

This hands method officials time around place last year It‚Äôs mandate opt it. Caves? Travel cavemen amoebas. need adapt embrace singularity want evolve. I‚Äôm 37 pregnant. husband put kids since first born end 2016 pandemic much deal (stress, work, families taking seriously) another child. hate fact postponed second child crap. imagine restrictions may still place I‚Äôm due give birth next year late March. Covid: Ok, then. Another asthmatic here, also wear masks fine, best bad inflammation. wont really matter, there's outdoors left. Plus even small fraction West moving surviving land absolutely depopulate game populations. Good thing vaccination provides robust efficacy symptomatic infection. Even so, people still take precautions desire. Fortunately, everyone tools reduce chances illness want to.

We're point person make decisions according risk. Study funded Moderna That's lot pressure put next generation. mention, gives us pass throw hands we've done everything can. time youngest generation wheel, many decades gone irreversible damage?  Florida wasn‚Äôt stupid enough. Next year won‚Äôt teachers left. Perfect way turn Florida bright red again. Well side effects actually immune system fighting perceived infection, strong side effects don‚Äôt mean immune system isn‚Äôt performing well, rather opposite.  think issue PR, manipulation, advertising. 

If 55 percent true, think is, left leaning areas full vaccinated Republicans. one possible take aways stat. 

With stat make hypothesis narrative left leaning areas right leaning areas different effects local population. 

Another hypothesis NY hit hard wave one, influenced folks people rely public transportation likely get vaccine. 

There billion ways look test. 

I really care politics are, leaders party cause area failing care that. Right now, proven, hypothesis disproven national survey small sample. fact, survey supports independents Republicans less vaccinated democrats, know point using was. Yup

Cam spend slow moving car wreck up?

I kiddos exposed via school (Texas) would feel better knowing tool taking valuable resources. Target =/= treat.

You can't increase dose something expect work. fact, Moderna booster going half original dose. side effects 100 microgram dose unpleasant.

Target means create specific antibody response **targeting** specific binding site. Monroe Civic Center major hub evacuees. ULM nursing/pharmacy &amp; VCOM testing sites set up. positives loaded taken St. Francis regeneron. yesterday, 12 positives. I‚Äôm sure number risen new evacuees arriving. can‚Äôt believe people loved ones die act like it‚Äôs biggie Yeah, article says birthrates drop catastrophic events, historically observed. also notes early interpret data. Oregon reporting 5.5% hospitalizations case rate breakthrough infections fully vaccinated people  Chiropractors doctors. opinion medicine worth much carpenter's.

Moderna Mafia** staffed event huge metro area 27,000 attendance vax mandate good mask compliance outbreak. catch anyone department 40ish folks. I'm surprised reports people making cards. biggest violation seems misrepresenting Federal agency's seal using without permission. would think someone could leave CDC logo use something place. late. anti-vaxers need get card once. MODERNA GANG

MODERNA MAFIA* thought recommendation Pfizer vaccine longer 3 weeks 6 - 8 weeks? first world problem right able nitpick finer points particular brand vaccine ""best"". although may ultimately offer little protection, fact anyone vaccinated 3 used US unlikely hospitalized die, actual goal vaccination, we're incredibly lucky opportunity vaccinated quickly. hope hear soon mass vaxx efforts low income regions (I'm sure lot people poor areas Africa would love chance, example). also hope hear news longer term efficacy J&amp;J since seem hear much think lot people really want know they're good go seek booster. Disassemble! late, people already cards. I... never considered that's works. That's good idea, I'll pass along! single shot without logistic problems mRNA vaccines good remote poorer communities. got mine 2 weeks ago. 2nd Moderna 2/12. 60, work public, autoimmune condition, (vitiligo). still clear whether ‚Äúcounts‚Äù not, Dr doesn‚Äôt, pharmacist local big box drug store certainly doesn‚Äôt. signed line, ticked boxes, gave 3rd shot Moderna, 3 entries vaccine card. feel safer going winter, continue mask up. really don‚Äôt want catch Covid, PERSONAL BELIEF lot selfish vaccinate get booster can. Im taking shot away anyone. special kind selfish /or stupid kid 2021 lot co-workers register vaccine, leave turned Moderna. One person 3 times. wait vaccine/appointments. 

Although Pfizer, think I'll show them! America? Far fewer people vaccinated J&amp;J, enough people gotten sick died yet publish study it. MODERNA MAFIA REPORTING IN!

SUCK PFIZER FAM! must also mean parents coaching children convincingly lie whatever fake condition going say have. 

Man people serious pervasive character flaws. feel bad kids.... think taught ok. also feel bad everyone else suffers parents teaching children. didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlie‚Äù vaccinated people needing masks. made medical statement, public policy recommendation. Vaccinated people statistically fine. 

Regardless, mask policy injecting something body. wasn‚Äôt going take Pfizer prior December didn‚Äôt know *worked.* I‚Äôll wait CDC/FDA guidance comes third shot, fully vaccinated healthy young person also covid, think I‚Äôm safe. Well 90% adults vaccinated. Thanks link. don‚Äôt think guy nurse though. filmmaker. bio says askscience thread back microbiologist commented 5x increase antibodies seems large smallest detect.

In case, love fact people talking *which* vaccine get, instead of... know. Yeah, realized fan saw ""fully vaccinated"" tag. I'm sorry man, hope people realize leadership's incompetence handling pandemic, choose change course. That's I'd rather call incompetent portray cunning, apparently seen bad quality unfortunately. 

Anyways, right, wrong sub. Stay safe. Wow, that‚Äôs sad.    got Pfizer (that's VA had) wanted Moderna know developed people helped. reeeaaaallly wanted get felt like me, personal bit medicine people personally trust. But, vaccine storm, right? Still happy it! Manitoba months ago.

its super simple.. get qr code comes physical card (or downloadable). app free download scans QR code. checks MB shared health Database API call returns name check mark vaccinated x aren't. faking it, since pulls name checks directly store/bar checks id ensure ID results match.

The way around QR code someone exact name, forging government documents pretty serious crime jail time. cool story think situation luxury waiting 6 12 months really exist. Even decide use ""time shots"" variable testing, might looking delaying rollout months, pushing two-shot protection months more. would certainly mean deaths.

And also know two shots offer lot protection single one. single shot what, like 70-something percent effective, two shots 3 weeks apart like 96%? people waiting months shots (in order get ""ideal"" immunity), they're sitting partial protection longer time, risk death would likely much higher settled ""suboptimal"" (but practically effective) one month wait time.

My point I'm sure lot smart immunologists debated exact point mentioned above, ultimately decided benefits tighter two-shot schedule outweighed risks.  I‚Äôm trial didn‚Äôt get $1000. I‚Äôm Atlanta, sure compensation varies location. got $150 per visit first 3, lowered $125 I‚Äôm $700 5 visits (4 jabs, 1 labs). answer basically wear mask forever. Got it. vaccine ever 100% perfect. point, say ‚Äúthe vaccine out, go get assess risk levels‚Äù. Europeans agree this, believe Macron said straight up. need vaccine passports. mask mandates.

Of course double vaxxed get virus. I‚Äôm scared vaccines great keeping people serious cases.

Where live serious cases well. 60% ICU beds empty. high vaccination rates. don‚Äôt mask mandate. whole process standardized. pharmacist gave option write original vaccine card issue new one 1st &amp; 2nd shots crossed out.

You better research. would bring child world perma-pandemic climate disasters happening concurrently?

People thing better abortion. Indeed. ""SpikeVax"" best product name far, think.

""Comirnaty"" weird name. Apparently even got marketing company come gave reasoning ‚ÄúThe name coined Covid-19 immunity, embeds mRNA middle, platform technology, whole name meant evoke word community,‚Äù Scott Piergrossi, Brand Institute president operations communications, said. 

The Oxford/AZ vaccine really much better, picked ""Vaxzevria"" product name. least "" vax"" name least bit clue is. hand, Serum Institute India also produces vaccine, markets name ""Covishield"", much better.

At J&amp;J bothered catchy name vaccine still called ""Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine"" Janssen Vaccines, Dutch J&amp;J subsidiary developed vaccine.

The Gamaleya Institute called vaccine ""Sputnik V"", weird given ""sputnik"" means ""satellite"". get national pride angle they're trying go for, viral vector vaccines satellites, last time checked.

Sinovac called vaccine ""CoronaVac"", incredibly point, also unimaginative.

And concludes brief roundup covid-19 vaccine names. clear exactly success stories comes branding. again, matter? Yep. Give people want.. fucking joke. I‚Äôm Alabama. may even exist. It‚Äôs going get worst. people \*\*do\*\* stop going hospital hospitals filled covid patients. That‚Äôs big-time contributor excess deaths, fwiw.

That point. hospitals full, admit less. Covid patients others would normally admitted turned away. decrease hospitalizations necessarily good news.  shitholes. New York walking tightrope overdosing underdosing. compressed trial timeline calibrated dosing based combined desire trigger immune response result excessive side-effects. we‚Äôve time, normal vaccine rollout would‚Äôve had, we‚Äôre recalibrating based better data, thankfully seems little harm done compressed booster schedule lower-dose Pfizer shot.

There, anecdote cancels anecdote. Good thing international flights non-preclearance airports can‚Äôt land LGA doesn‚Äôt customs facilities. ‚ÄúConsider‚Äù got scared worried. shouldn‚Äôt have! even vaccinating front line workers rna vaccines   Spain digital vaccine certificate linked national health card card, holds medical history, bio data etc. don‚Äôt know easy fake us it‚Äôs possible here, businesses get government qr scanners confirm reject vaccine certs. thing transmit yes cert, data. seems work fine   That's horrifying. like saying died stomach cancer, actually got shot head died immediately injury. understand that. That's would option prefer it. many people dislike in-person model, right force upon people easy alternatives readily available. goes way - right force people prefer in-person learning virtual learning. negative test accepted. could try reading article next time. ACOG‚Äôs initial guidance December 2020 covid vaccines withheld pregnant individuals ‚Äúwho meet criteria vaccination based ACIP-recommended priority groups.‚Äù guidance went say ‚Äúpregnant patients decline vaccination supported decision.‚Äù 

To knowledge, official ACOG guidance Delta strain came out. Nothing like taking upon make medical decisions approved yet. r/redditmoment Same. Humanity dealt worse, people still kids. know ship 1170-dose packs. I'm sure pack unique lot number. resource somewhere shows vaccinations people received ending breakthrough case serious enough end hospitalization? moderna master race imagine different US would right eligible adults vaccinated??? happy hear this. Got ass kicked 2nd Moderna jab. schools without robust testing 1 20 people currently confirmed infected still closing week. example, there's two schools Texas district 6% infected another 5%: 

What shining star! think that's gamble took booking travel pandemic. booked huge family trip end September back January. absolutely thought would now. canceled I'm like $100. again, that's risk took. FYI got full refund flights Hawaiian Air original flights canceled/changed. paid hair? They'll less cases overtime people either evacuated died. mRNA vaccines? vaccines they‚Äôre working getting better so, let‚Äôs see! effectively yes, you‚Äôre right. issues heart inflammation believe young men. People heart attacks well. much linked second shpt? knows. shots definitely 99.9999% safe. gave everyone peanuts world, someone going bad day. don‚Äôt want vaccinated people US! /s I'm sure we'll get booster shots future. father got 3rd jab Moderna last week lives 3rd world country. governor state health advisors advise mask mandate necessary us

Yeah, Florida Texas to.  Abbot, DeSantis, Trump think know CDC put together.  no-mak thing working great right now. COVID over! Heckuva job.  


I‚Äòve never seen someone much effort shirking responsibility before. you‚Äôve got going too. Nice see Moderna get love. Pfizer times while. what, pandemic? requirements likely get checked virus circulating there's uptake highly effective vaccine pervasive end this. end illness? get vaccinated. People severely ill seeing inside restaurant gyms right they've sick long enough understand likely might die contract delta variant. efficacy may biggest medical miracle history species.

Excuse antibiotics smallpox vaccine would like word.... Same, first cold since end 2019 Experts opinions data. study data showing 3-4 week interval highly efficacious. I‚Äôm saying bad idea spread doses, I‚Äôm saying data 3-4 week interval effective preventing symptomatic covid. SpikeVax masterrace wonder many people get fake IDs rather get vaccine?

It's real shame spend Hawaiian vacation jail.  pay attention news channels major news outlets appears though vaccine nothing all. it‚Äôs hyperbole simply true. 97% hospitalized COVID patients still unvaccinated. better stat something like 99.9997% COVID deaths unvaccinated individuals. data graphs really see numbers stacking up. anyone else unlucky enough breakthrough infection?

My 10 year old caught covid school gave me. Everyone else household negative despite close contact (they're vaccinated). figured I'd safe since got 2nd Moderna 4 months ago. bad feel, really makes wonder would wound hospital vaccinated. declined. went 97% effective preventing severe disease elderly ‚Äúonly‚Äù ~85%. That‚Äôs still pretty good, booster probably push back high 90s. Mother Nature pwning us, guess. caffeine, alcohol, no... bleu cheese?? C‚Äômon, man. contrast birth surges e.g. power outages, case suspect main issue ""hospitals overwhelmed"". pregnancy risk probably willing take told hospital beds unavailable need one. equal indeed better get one even though best, get booster later. least time protected. getting vaccine best one like driving motorcycle without helmet cannot buy secure, sophisticated helmet.  Got second shot 2 weeks getting pregnant get booster available. friends get baby though. used MERS outbreak believe, still titled ‚Äúresurgence coronavirus Saudi Arabia‚Äù something back January 2020. Welcome club ppl whomst usernames got new meaning pandemic struck gut feeling nothing COVID policies. Sample size 1, got antibodies tested 7 months second moderna jab. antibodies currently 623.  agree, problem lot vaccinated people want hear that. want ditch masks live unfettered restrictions like 2019, get breakthrough point unvaxxed blame instead taking responsibility actions. 

Yes, ideal would every single person gets vaccinated, vaccinated person goes maskless, distance, knowingly hangs unvaxxed people, bear responsibility negative outcomes. everyone know breakthrough cases real, uncommon, always result asymptomatic mild cases. significant evidence vaccinated **asymptomatic** individuals spread virus? not, far ""extremely alarming"". ScoMo fucking useless. He's completely fucked vaccine rollout, months behind every time manages secure tiny amount vaccines acts massive victory. Yeah, still remember image body bags piling front refrigerated trucks since enough space look risk management standpoint....which better street house? house obviously. better house hotel? hotel probably, hard imagine feasible long term. better house everyone one room unmasked sharing drinks everyone room much possible, masking, etc? get idea.

saving little risk allow absorb big ones baby bust before, nobody afford live own, let alone taking care child CDC currently reports 74.2% US adults full population number. aren‚Äôt counting. Hospitals really designed function certain threshold. They're for-profit, all. mean one going care J&amp;J vaccine since even immunocompromised authorized get mRNA vaccine booster got J&amp;J. Well, 5 billion doses worldwide far, they're billion shots month now. That's mostly China/India, million shots US slowing much (like less hour month). also clear yet CDC going recommend widespread boosters. call milestone goal higher? Epidemiologists saying need 90% Delta. I'm seems bit high. thought studies like 75-80% Delta. least like 6 months. also account potential waning immunity, limited data confounders make hard quantify it, blame that. may matter much risk critical outcomes, may weigh heavily score. Labor &amp; Delivery well Mother/Baby floors typically separated rest hospital days. slightly secured rest hospital help prevent people wandering onto floor picking baby *happen* nursery craziness like that.

Post L&amp;D complications I'm sure about, though know NICUs filling certain areas. got fourth shot 2 moderna 2 Pfizer. chances breakthrough? Well apparently plenty people happy injected horse dewormer rather vaccine, really hard understand. identity challenged vaccine, that's unfortunate. Same, Pfizer me. wanted Vax. Nothing exposed complete lack safety net country pandemic. 

I would love kids. even good job could afford it. 

But would take couple bad things happen everything come crashing down. stress thinking possibility keeps kids right now. Crazy 

In community kids wearing masks. Everyone goes along. single issue staff teachers 100% vaccinated 

This like different country 22 Blount County, Tennessee. went program too, surprised quick blood draw was. Normally need get blood taken i'm sitting forever waiting bunch tubes get filled, look fast imagine filled tiniest little container, could exaggerating swear like 10 seconds tops. pandemic over, no, getting vaccine last year entitle break law today anti-masking partier spreading virus kids vulnerable people. Vaccinated anti-mask/anti-lockdowners entitled sociopaths. Everyone note Peter Doshi's name article. guy outright antivaxer miracle BMJ continue allow peddle using name. area, running hierarchical system vaccines first available. fairly healthy woman forties teenage children apparently eligible booster yet. :(

Edit: plus side, 86 year old parents getting boosters week, least helpful. despicable.  thick tit x u/cuddlebug420 chill!

u/Justinhub2003 admire sense responsibility way handle situation friend, hard ideals friends times believe way behaved got lot respect appreciation hopefully future consider lot advice. Glad know family ok. Wish best! Good news. hear this. Thanks sharing!  Yep, I've three colds since pandemic started. Every time tested negative. happens! sounds unlikely me. don‚Äôt think technology work every virus, imagine immune system would go absolutely nuts trying create antibodies many viruses time.  Laura devastating, path destruction less inhabited area one talks it. Interesting. Thanks sharing paper! I'm particularly happy confidence interval results, I'm entirely sure comparisons statistically valid, present interesting results. next question particular bias states received vaccine, states experienced significant outbreaks. I.E. Florida receive pfizer vaccinations moderna Florida large outbreak, circulating viral load enough overcome vaccine's protection, states may higher relative Moderna vaccination rate experience outbreaks degree unvaccinated populations, etc. may answered that, got lost table hell. 

At least, I'm happy know effective reducing hospitalizations. love hit song ""Let Bodies Hit Lore."" Part reason take grain salt something people missing antibody load isn‚Äôt necessarily directly correlated well protects future immune responses. example, know situations people little antibody load protected things require antibodies. One explanation well develop memory b-cells easily stimulated make antibodies future. immune system vastly complex need careful drawing conclusions time still figuring basic sure people seeing, shopping instincts said moderna better all. put words made think tho. Yeah theory that, essentially, vaccines make illness worse rather better essentially accelerating impact virus host.

This theory potential could work modeled simulations real world evidence it. point billions vaccinated millions hospitalized sick plenty data see vaccines decreasing rather increasing illness happens exposure. someone knows someone else unvaxxed still hangs them, willingly taking chance. commend u/Justinhub2003 taking responsibility actions outcome. I‚Äôm surprised all. us highly skeptical booster timeline went 8 months, 5, 6 course week seemingly additional guidance CDC FDA back up.

Even then, many scientists don‚Äôt yet agree need booster non-immunocompromised populations. really think WH saw opportunity‚Äî rising case numbers, looming FDA approval boosters specific subset people‚Äî ran it. stupidity display climate going bust, would even consider  ...Yes, should, vaccinated people spread virus, actually kids and/or actually give damn kids. fever 4 days second Moderna dose. feel good least week. got J&amp;J one, took care relative covid week, get it. Trust me, works. Same, second dose made feel like ran wall 3 days. Still noticed exercise hard week after. I'd go normal 5-6mi run would absolutely struggle first 3 miles got 37. Young, go work, fully vaccinated. calculator assumes symptomatic case protection 94% believe updated Delta supremely Canadian going get lot hate, but.. still gatherings covid?

A lot family lost power, water, even homes destroyed. We're sheltering around ten people get lives back track. majority us vaccinated, 10/10 new people and.. Unfortunately 1/3 people normally live here. 1 me.

Is this.. Okay? can't let rot street, surely. power say ""hey go home"" either. precautions take?  going tell ya Google it, since meant send gma anyway, ya Oh wow, know gave details beyond positive/negative registered. Adding to-do list! Curious see actual numbers  Want demoralize people care children? that‚Äôs demoralize people care children. hard overstate satisfaction. FDA didn‚Äôt fully approve it, reason didnt get it. FDA approves thats reason wont get it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ahhh yes logic! feeble mind would never understand. Probably vaccine dam mind control taking over. good argument Federalization Education  Rationalize away‚Ä¶ Damn, that's heavy stuff. Hopefully nothing long term. Guaranteed multiple people walking around public today, right now, smug attitude, dead 3 weeks moment read this. stupid pride getting vaccinated. dumb. Wow. Definition douchebaggery. long take droplets/aerosols fully hit ground? someone unvaccinated home tomorrow want know long stay house air settled re-enter safely Please come! time. studies looking benefits changing standard regimen 3 doses instead 2 group immunocompromised expected results time soon? 

So much discussion seems focused whether waning immunity boosters, I'm curious comparison 2nd vs 3rd dose effectiveness Delta without waning. Haha you‚Äôre right. guess meant safest epoch :P said earlier OP told friend friend put OPs family risk. sounded petty like wanted OP assign blame decision consciously made friend. I'm calling unproductive. 

You correct OPs friend puts unvaccinated people encounter risk hospitalizing, however I'm kind laughing words people would ""sociopaths"" getting vaccinated. I'm also calling unproductive. 

We've simply got difference strategy comes encouraging vaccines. like avoid insulting people usually makes act even irrationally spite talking uncle vaccines recommends. said try get modera vaccine targets spike proteins. company created emergency approved covid tests last year. company better Germany company Also don‚Äôt forget Moderna covid shot called SpikeVax Pfizers Comirnaty. definitely ended winning! Lol Yes die get vaccinated. Covid: *shrugs*. ""Suits fine."" Yeah, stressful sure! 

As per IRS rules start working soon applied, right appointment. far USCIS concerned start working second lands, employer *has* let start within certain number days. Depending risk-averse employer is, may possible start right away. really depends scary IRS penalties would (basically: consult lawyer explore options). 

FWIW managed get appointment within 10 days arriving, actually bad. babysit phone though, apparently call once. fear-more boosters-more $$$  study done showing llama fluids possobly antibodies covid.

They're gonna suckin llama dicks making llamas winter  Fair enough. Transhumanists would perhaps argue (erroneously think) star streak utopia possible near future. would also get vasectomy I‚Äôm thankfully gay don‚Äôt worry :)) currently live safest time human history, things considered.

All things considered, I'd pick September 2019 safest time human history. wish Moderna  Yeah, family member catch Covid getting J&amp;J vaccine, develop symptoms (would never realized gotten tested work requirement.) vaccine better vaccine! Always tell doctors doctors put body, especially getting something else put Yeah, willing get whatever. data available whether mixing covid vaccines going okay, theory mixing fine. 

They're mRNA vaccines, things get vaccines for, makes vaccines whether booster made company thought. Like hell know whether boosters vaccines got Grade 6 manufacturer ones gave infant Okay, new goal: 95% population, age groups included. slightest. fully expect republicans win future subsidize oil gas penalize green energy. moderna mafia phizer friends

if get one dose each, called arnold pharma? Avoid Advil. It‚Äôs anti inflammatory. Covid shot works causing amount inflammation. Tylenol fine. that‚Äôs put ass 3 days JNJ perfectly fine vaccine, IMO.

You understand difference RNA DNA vaccine. Instead giving fixed dose RNA, DNA vaccine sets RNA factory cells, keeps micro-dosing RNA vaccine vaccine DNA cells. That's JNJ immunity keeps building couple months shot. event would precipitated global societal collapse way makes climate change look like fucking tea party.

Not sure that. Nuclear war hits fast hard. Climate change slow burn. It'll incite social unrest catastrophe's spanning decades. might even escalate tensions point nuclear war becomes threat again!  Believe said previous AMAs clear variant contagious others. still hold Delta circulating? Sure, going much effective current vaccines, all. They're going abandoned boosters simply going existing vaccines.

They might issue new booster new strain comes significantly changed binding domain/target, far spike relatively unchanged. saw today cdc director asked gun control. Totally political point.  Pregnant women probably one category people never look hesitancy, even now. We‚Äôre discouraged eating fucking sandwich meats crying loud yet suddenly every staunch vaccine advocate slamming expectant mothers suss something wasn‚Äôt even recommended begin with? Harsh. understanding fevers bigger deal first trimester. I‚Äôm going get booster pregnant possible hopefully confer baby antibodies.
 
But going doctor‚Äôs recommendation. fudges numbers always look like they‚Äôre decline. Tried post bot removed it.  Get real. can't let Gladys look bad favouring areas interest 

Anyway, many seats regional remote NSW rock solid lib/nat

So benefit Gladys looking I'm relieved get boosters. read maybe recommended 5 months? would awesome. hope next booster would needed four months, next three. 5 months seems like long time wait between. Please encourage follow latest recommendations get vaccine. got mine pregnant baby kicking away there. tough decision make back May I‚Äôm glad decided get it. Mostly discouraged haven‚Äôt given enough positive reinforcement decision. recently became available friends family actively question whether should.   Lol boasting   No, seems confusing. like kid going school, violation civil rights children made wear masks puts risk.  Never been. I'm suggesting common sense, specially immunocompromised live someone condition. 

I like restrictions, oppose vaccination passports. support common sense. According far Florida 3,227,385 covid cases

According [US 2019 Florida alone (ignoring fact covid cross state borders) population 21,477,737 people.

With following caveats(and probably more):

- Ignoring vaccines leads complications like people who've caught covid also later vaccinated people vaccinated still catch covid;

- Ignoring people dying born would change population.

- Ignoring Florida's terrible covid testing system, especially beginning.

- Ignoring false positives negatives.

That's 18,250,352 people never infected covid ~6x current total figure. Effectiveness measured alternative baseline population slowly gaining natural exposure novel coronavirus.

Reduced efficacy due compared general population constantly increasing exposure generally expected. Furthermore, mild cases treated effectively reduces baseline comparison serious cases vaccine effectiveness measured against. Yes, part variants less well targeted part decreasing antibodies, need dive much deeper stats draw conclusions, looking 80% saying ‚Äúgee, that‚Äôs lot drop‚Äù doesn‚Äôt tell much anything. better start making life better vaccinated noone getting 3rd jab, people really tired BS Better add three portable morgues. case.  fair, US doesnt allow people EU visit. 

And worse vaccination rates higher EU US. Good job Biden lol    Ugh can‚Äôt drive 11‚Äô tall vehicle drive thrus get C12 Good hear didn‚Äôt last long! fever came nowhere 12 hours in; sat beer watch baseball, knew 40 degree fever.

It might dumb, I‚Äôm going highly reticent get Moderna booster, Pfizer also offered timely fashion. expert, way understand it, cells producing spike protein symptoms, taking advantage something cells routinely do. symptoms immune response, first injection site, systemic immune response kicks high gear. mean that‚Äôs bare minimum. Unfortunately it‚Äôs still happening lot countries poor lockdowns low vaccination rates. Mine lasted 24 hours first shot Moderna, 12 hours second, fever chills third booster (just hell headache fatigue).  This. It‚Äôs normal feel like fucking crap 1.5 years living PANDEMIC changed way socialize interact humans. Even suggestions made like avoiding crowds concerts makes sad would nice go back music festival mosh crowd. reads patronizing IMO. 24 hours second dose (Moderna, first dose Pfizer) side effects hitting like train. long fever/headache/chills usually last? likely next variant comes along  know cousin South Carolina sounded **lot** open getting vaccinated since delta hit.  would great help prevent spread COVID-19. New York state legislature must get done help end pandemic, prevent sickness, save lives, help economy recover.  corpse, choice. luck, people succumb stupidity that. Willing die rather get vaccine... Okay... you... Less stupid world guess? flight Germany October 7th everything air. Drones shoot vaccines tranq guns Consumption demand big companies exist, they‚Äôre driven people‚Äôs lifestyles choices.  Give months variant straight rocks house burns Nice try, Satan Oh wow 10,000 big number. Much panic. 

Covid cases Flrodia August 28th: 16,373. Bigger number panic. 

Deaths August 28th: 181. Life life that's sad butttttt 

Average chance death? 1% 

0 kids. 

Parents vaccinated?

G-Parents vaccinated? 

Should good? 

Honestly brain works simple short sighted logic. honestly asking explain panic. want understand truly. inauguration ceremony delay vaccine production?  treatment selfish start believe science sick won‚Äôt anything prevent spread. Wonder many infected?  things mutually exclusive. order crush Delta surge focus therapeutics well (especially states/countries higher vaccination rates). Eid, onam moderna/Pfizer.

Which side effects linked body making spike protein, linked body's response spike protein?  Patients wouldn‚Äôt sick got vaccinated. woman cheerleader anti-vaxx idiots ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt actually covid killed them, listed that‚Äù

Telling people dying means NOTHING them. all, they‚Äôre Jesus now. 85,000 people Singapore received two Sinovac vaccine doses since first batch 200,000 arrived February year. among 80 per cent Singapore‚Äôs 5.7 million people fully vaccinated Covid-19, country moves towards reopening borders. 
     
Singapore government officials Singapore population smart COVID-19 pandemic, control it, help end it, prevent infections, prevent deaths.

At end June 2020, Singapore estimated population [5.69 people. 
       
Thus, overall COVID-19 mortality rate Singapore 0.97 deaths per 100k population. 
      
In comparison, pandemic, US confirmed [total COVID-19 cases [total COVID-19 deaths country, [including COVID-19 deaths past 28 days.

Also, Moderna approved soon. Lol think rest public could use bit guidance point. NP? pt? Rn? Get vaccinated worry: they'll die soon ...that seem like bad thing. mix n match best performance really thing United States, unfortunately. interpreted way.  Israel vaccinated enough lower-aged population, partially due large proportion children. However 60+ ages, vast majority hospitalizations come from, Israel par countries like Denmark, better (= 90% fully vaccinated). conclusion precisely wrote: relying vaccines' protection severe disease insufficient contain virus level would risk healthcare system, countries mentioned ‚Äî Denmark, Iceland ‚Äî good shape precisely vaccine's ability reduce virus spread ‚Äî which, due success vaccinating higher % people Israel, recently, allowed stop exponential spread virus ‚Äî despite ""the aim"" vaccine. wife got pregnant one week getting fully vaxed. Talk dodging worried choice Yeah. people expect CDC lie claim ton data? don't. article July 15th, would take account Delta changed landscape. Even article doubt could make conclusions cautioned lack observed post-Covid-19 cases vaccinated people ""just might lag time issue."" is, Covid-19 vaccinations started rolling en masse within past three four months, possible enough time passed identify long-haul patients following Natasha Altman, cardiologist UCHealth University Colorado Hospital Aurora, agreed may soon understand vaccines' effects long-term Covid-19 symptoms. watching CDC meeting. slide said, ""Is COVID19 still public health importance?""

This good question. virus hopefully go massive pandemic endemic annoyance. Right huge threat, forever. 

People lot fear restrictions never end, important note CDC continually evaluating whether restrictions necessary.   Politics career path like other.

Oh get politicians see way... many constituents -- know, people ""hired"" person election -- could give 2 shits ambitions, progressive otherwise. 

**Just job now.** well, cause major fuckups, we'll consider next rung ladder  took anti-vaxxer Caleb Wallace month die ICU. You‚Äôre going clear everybody night. Something wrong CDC. seem inability understand follow science. Instead feels like bunch non-politicians dabbling politics time avoid bad political outcomes, cause different bad political outcomes.    did! Covid alpha hit slowly live Florida. Delta hand hit like train. Nearly everyone knew got time. Including got vaxxed. Nearly everyone know weren‚Äôt anti vaxxers didn‚Äôt feel super necessary, it. Still waiting governor step up... No, federal mask mandate only. Luckily every gas station live bathroom use. TIL Florida civilized. dot i? What's that? reasonable wait full trials children everyone thought adults would vaccinate thus pretty much provide herd immunity everyone else. 

Now know half adults irredeemable morons, makes sense change course emergency approve vaccines children... adults. explanation vaccine working well old? immune system, simply can‚Äôt deal tons viruses hitting system sick person family?  


I still looking explanation this. France way Germany moment, greatly part due new rules require vaccination paid test result access pretty much everything Thank you! listen asap tomorrow. NP, management asking us encourage vaccination. I'm flabbergasted everytime try talk pt it. People reading saying crazy rn. Umm, Floridian here....what decline actually talking about? best leveling 7 day rolling average, sure hell reality. believe run test reporting things accurately anymore (especially bad reporting).

I mean, look death graph plummeting continue hit time highs infection. points Aug 15th peak deaths month, day started plateauing cases...that suspicious hell. nothing else started leveling deaths well nah, straight drop triple digits 14 deaths 28th! calling hard BS numbers. I'm you. pass anything punctures skin cause feel woozy seeing images shots. Shit half motivation getting shots help get point need see someone getting shot every damn news article open lol. actual hell? system messed live faults, least mandatory quarantine test positive direct contact someone positive.I can‚Äôt believe would allow someone knowingly Covid positive attend school. beyond irresponsible. I'm eagerly waiting SMART health pass integrations. States can't adopt soon enough! Early weren‚Äôt pushing vaccines pregnant women. Many pregnant women hesitant get vaccine obgyn‚Äôs weren‚Äôt sure first. number vaxxed pregnant women increasing though obgyn‚Äôs promoting heavily practices. you‚Äôre told can‚Äôt even take normal aspirin, idea vaccinating pregnant scary. Honestly surprising. Pregnant women encouraged take antidepressants/certain prescription medications also told get MMR vaccine pregnancy. could see someone dealing lot fear losing baby, needs avoid cheese, vitamin A, prepacked salads, stopped taking prescription medication, bit weirded taking relatively new vaccine. fundamentally different vaccine skepticism. person protected others society getting vaccine. end? 

The rankings based transmission speed amount. transmission shows, US move safer designation. Yeah, I'm pro-vaccine come, I'm going give pregnant women slack too. crazy hesitancy, comes vaccine developed year ago minimal data specific pregnant women babies.

I would still recommend pregnant women get vaccinated, high risk develop COVID, I'm going judge pregnant woman hesitant, way would judge one else. might want wish something realistic, say world peace? Thank link. Prayers Pope Francis prayers scientists created vaccines! Let's get shots die accidentally kill someone else! Go Pope Go! Meanwhile, local health department telling parents multiple children even though one child household tested positive, child go back school they're vaccinated....

Now, keep mind recommendation nurse, recommendation doctors hospital work Virginia Department Health said that's schools saying absences excused cases unless child household tested positive.  Big island next, plz  '11  Summer peak florida like last year. seems pretty clear me. much less likely get hospitalized vaccinated get infected much less likely get hospitalized get Regeneron. rocket science. We're going Kenney type leadership Federal level. Yep, we're fucked. hope peak truly behind Florida. 

We're August. even holidays. happens people start meeting holidays like last year? 

It's gonna motherfucking zombie apocalypse Thanksgiving.  approved emergency use monoclonal treatment. FULLY FDA APPROVED!!

Just like Moderna J&amp;J vaccines.  time people stop abusing religious exemption out. medical process oversight Covid doctor notes sold people.  Free now.  places thought preventing Covid postponing it. lot variable contend here. I'm saying understand think lot people don't.

America nearly 40 million confirmed cases easily conceivable number much higher since many cases symptoms. People Covid vaccinated going different results.

The number breakthrough infections still pretty low means data far less data infections general. number people Covid get second time low. number breakthrough infections already Covid even lower.

All things variables. also age, preexisting conditions, everybody's different immune systems. expects file U.S. emergency use authorization fourth quarter 2021 Florida could falsifying data seeing consequences policy currently. Germany EU average.

What definition Western Europe? Germany everything west it? UN definition, ~6 countries, half German speaking? StAGN, excludes Germany? think word means think means feel like Israel saying thrice vaccinated ""fully vax"" 9/1 jumping gun bit, tbh  new case numbers steady. capacity testing  big question me. (re: booster). worth risk maybe 101 degree fever 12 hours low chance getting Delta---or take risk delta, may may give fever breakthrough..but could \*other\* effects baby? Seriously, whole idea blaming vaccinated tourists source problem absurd. I'd assume try start civil war, going prison going somewhere, probably box. Right. got stance flip flop random? knowledge. biggest supporter vaccines town, effectiveness hospitalization dropping relatively rapidly...if 2 years would say yep that's expected--but 98-99% 80% matter months? big yikes forgot Sonic. Seems like ideal business model pandemic. Thanks.

Maybe it‚Äôs worse think? Let‚Äôs keep perspective. Covid disease rips elderly much harshly young, there‚Äôs reason hospitalizations still currently mostly comprise unvaccinated adults kids didn‚Äôt get chance get vaccinated yet. I‚Äôd still like see less kids get infected they‚Äôre approved vaccine, amount people think achieved getting vaccinated people mask getting unvaccinated adults vaccinated aneurysm inducing. anecdotal stories poor evidence, however wealth data supporting young healthy people low risk. We‚Äôve known risks extremely stratified age since beginning I‚Äôm teaching remotely large school district another state. hope catches on. position going last least 3 years. surprising, Palau free association USA meaning USA provides Palau lot services like defense, post office, social services, etc. Americans traveling time help administer that. What's surprising happen earlier. Actually,  Sure, like booming consumer based economy. month's ago UK previous wave u.s. behind? teach Illinois high school, quarantine rules here. also mask mandate, confirmed cases 10 days school... Fingers crossed stays way. convert vaccine card european covid pass pharmacies participate vaccination program. also heard could convert CDG airport. Wow, judge lucky reversed decision. can't imagine state winning lawsuit. I'm baffled think unvaccinated teacher danger kids. would want kids room them? literally care kill children parents. 8f airlines enforced vaccination requirements, would bad issue. Enough w8th carrot. Bring stick Here's hoping increased urgency vaccinations supporting higher vaccination rate, introduction thousand monoclonal antibodies treatment appointments per day, hospitalizations quickly mirror decline new cases and, ultimately, daily death count plummets back down.

The counts still high, movement right direction, welcome.  ‚ÄúThose attended party; shame you,‚Äù said DOCARE Enforcement Chief Jason Redulla. ‚ÄúThink effects gathering everyone, including potential higher case count could result severe public restrictions.‚Äù

Was kind anti-vax party, normal party? Imagine taking kind attitude towards people followed rules last year got vaccines soon could. criteria ‚Äúdone Covid‚Äù one spread it, definition never move since Covid forever vaccinated people always able spread it. point vaccines reduce symptoms, that‚Äôs it. reduced spread Delta cherry top, main desert. reminder, Delta came country didn‚Äôt vaccine access yet, didn‚Äôt come vaccinated people taking mask resuming normal life. Labor day next monday. We'll see happens then.  far, threat;  low infection rate nice

... want functional hospitals. 

&amp;#x200B;

( keep children 12 said hospitals actually vaccinated. ) public goal we're trying achieve country? trying eradicate Covid completely? goal achievable?

I guess point I'm trying make we're going live Covid long time I'm trying understand means terms living society near medium future. Preaching choir.  Insulin. like call ""meh sugar"". understand Hawaii‚Äôs hospitals filling compared states, general I‚Äôm sure advice particularly relevant vaccinated terms travel. Covid home state state travel to, it‚Äôs really perpetuating spread moving around. You‚Äôd want avoid areas hospitals full, see zero reason vaccinated one avoid traveling state low hospitalizations.  Can‚Äôt treat anti vaxxers like second class citizens? would much easier. area shortages encompass much country.

Florida, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina far.
You know, ones also risk hurricanes like Ida make road rail transport easy.

Not many drivers rated moving oxygen, far know. Sooner later won‚Äôt enough medical grade oxygen drivers move long distances keeps getting worse.

I wish local production options supplement big production plants.  saw wendy's burger king help wanted signs, $100 signing bonus. across street feel everyone using bathroom then. could not. think that? Yup, is. US many places actually start taking things seriously instead repeatedly re-opening prematurely, actually suppressing viral spread sufficiently able actually trace isolate new cases (and thus control spread even further) getting booster(s)!

I wish bought Moderna stock. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah keep hearing fastest vaccinations shit.... read 62% ? that's in-line rest western world, nowhere near impressive people try paint it...... effectiveness always measured prevention severe illness

Protection severe illness certainly important consideration, primary endpoint analysis Pfizer Moderna prevention symptomatic illness:

Moderna - ""The primary endpoint prevention symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Key secondary endpoints include prevention severe COVID-19 disease prevention infection SARS-CoV-2.""

Pfizer - ""The trial‚Äôs primary endpoints prevention COVID-19 infected SARS-CoV-2 prior immunization prevention COVID-19 regardless whether participants previously infected SARS-CoV-2. Secondary endpoints include prevention severe COVID-19 groups.""

Of 3 vaccines available US, J&amp;J/ Janssen primarily evaluated moderate severe/critical COVID-19. Alright, fuck people. time compromise over. fucking hope so. work McDs hardly staffing keep drive thru let alone lobby dining does, 100%. already flights, hotels, etc booked? plan figured details yet? alright book - worries.   standard care. Using something approved leaves doctors liable potential lawsuit. vaccinated, go. Canceling trip anything besides waste ton money.  wear mask indoors

Minor correction; immunity comes vaccination infection, mask use won‚Äôt accelerate immunity community. Unvaccinated people wear them, without vaccine eventually get infected. low infection rate nice, ultimately useless widespread immunity isn‚Äôt high enough, saw May June low infection rates unvaccinated drive infections restrictions go away perpetuate restriction cycle. people don‚Äôt fit highschool leaders tomorrow. sports/cool kids peak high school Lol go r break. Wear mask walk around outside. low risk. course case came USA...  Meanwhile, can‚Äôt wait get everyone back office see smiling faces *cough* ehem, probably nothing..   Given pandemic, also difficult appreciate long kinds studies generally take. normal circumstances, 1-2+ years time all, people dying en masse around you, hard hear ""we'll let know years."" Crazy. Allstate entered chat  Pretty sure herd immunity pipe dream point.

At least that's telling Canada....after got vaccinated record numbers. That's one thing I'm always remind myself.

I could give two fucks less die. innocents get infected ignorance, upsets me.   could comply call expert horse vet properly administer drug. Enjoy vacation. Don‚Äôt cancel.  real ""better"" vaccine Delta. spike protein essentially Alpha. Thus would real difference vaccine structure.

What makes Delta much infectious viral load, 300 1000x greater Alpha variants. something vaccine fix. it? supposed good vaccine, too. talked manufacturing South Korea, there's silence now. Maybe countries money already committed options? home testing added in. Big part dip. TS gonna stop Florida lol. cares? want kid protected, we‚Äôve seen conclusive evidence goalpost stand antivax crowd anyhow.  It‚Äôs like middle manager going golfing instead approving paperwork lol Muh rights! They're still 80%+ hospitalizations. They're also ones causing mandates semi-lockdowns again. Also since 80% hospitalizations unvaccinated people, means could least 66% reduction Covid hospitalizations people got vaccinated. 

Not mention non vaxxed people taking hospital beds, pushing hospitals max capacity again. What‚Äôs nuts 75% eligible Hawaiians one dose, 55% fully vaccinated Hope brewer Timthetatman‚Äôs son ok barely ever eat fast food anyway opportunity never interact typical fast food employee via apps car side delivery reason would eat future.

But I‚Äôm reading anecdotally people getting third shot. Ehh, Madison great places start 15 here, get reliable roommate live pretty comfortably.  Actually Get Red areas pay quality cities better. feel like saying know want say show way That's great. Since RSV worst small babies, may end saving many babies lives. much ‚Äúsytem.‚Äù states might databases, suspect it‚Äôs pretty easy get shot one knows dose you‚Äôre on. Lmao. never going happen. did, 40% idiotic country would riot. 

It would great, let‚Äôs realistic. Consider??? news??? Yet also might seriously result terrible symptoms otherwise healthy, athletic person comorbidities. 

Maybe everyone wore masks, got vaccinated practiced social distancing we‚Äôd better place. people keep saying it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs fault fat people, it‚Äôs fine. are. understand, typical delta variant N501S/Y mutation, one does. Delta lil alpha twist one Brentwood CA?  vaccinated. took responsibility.

It turns responsible one-shot-one-day thing.  takes fully adult-level responsible deadly pandemic.  shame all, are. don‚Äôt know people can‚Äôt comprehend vaccines leagues beyond mask

And yet masks still going necessary get infection rates non-disaster levels. That's are. CDC laundry list guidelines society ignored years. mean, come on, tell eat raw fish. 

You actually find website, Joe Rogan thing?  

Tell whatever think need pretend know ending pandemic CDC. Yea. mean risk getting Delta vs getting booster actually approved...easy decision me. ""you see graphite IT. WASN'T. THERE!"" work giant coffee chain we're waiting enforce 9/13. way time go talking points, ensure employees least one shot, etc mean outcomes obese startlingly worse. It‚Äôs certainly contributing factor. Obviously virus ‚Äúcause‚Äù it‚Äôs like ignore comorbidities. getting vaccinated cause? Lol schools going keep track info there's kind survey symptoms general anyway, none testing done randomly people going get tested symptoms know exposed someone did. 

It's already lot handle contact trace students actually sitting within 6 feet student long enough without students wearing mask minimize disruption quarantines educations. taking several people per school's whole days take care tracing contacts home that. We're going spend much extra time keeping records symptoms every day. bad data have, data we're really position collect.

And kind seems like implying since numbers symptomatic probably low governor right threaten us defunding requiring masks instead take zero mitigation measures like wants.   district, common argument anti-mask anti-vaccine parents don‚Äôt want kids ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure suffer way get virus. know much better idiots science experiments shit. Fuckin nerds. Get lab watch Fox News while, willya?  It‚Äôs highly likely % long term issues proportional % need hospitalizations. rate they'll another opportunity get Delta variant booster shot Okay thank you! make clear data null, leave null data moving averages. stands, charts paint misleading picture sure. Better safe sorry, know they‚Äôre doing. Trust science heard (reputable news channel) Aus there‚Äôs fifth variant; much worse contagious other. 

So what‚Äôs one called then; Epsilon? Quinary? Fifth Wave? Yankee Doodle variant?

I can‚Äôt remember said originating. want confirm first crazy speculation. vaccines work *new* new variant too? Uh oh. Thanks stats. don‚Äôt want downplay tragedy kid dying, risk actually startlingly low. I‚Äôm guessing almost many kids choke death tator tots. Keep mind would 80% protection variant 200% risk hospitalization according recent studies.

The elderly need boosters asap. remember way back, like 2 months ago, pre-Delta summer full lifted mandates exuberant gatherings. cases drop like things open without another hospital-squashing wave illness, know met goal carry returning normal world. Let‚Äôs shut entire country everyone forcibly vaccinated COVID disappears. 

That would work. Unnecessary bureaucracy. vaccine works adults kids 12+ testing reviewing doses Wow. holy shit. called Ambulance Covid19, Nurses said arrived O2 around 68%. called Ambulance myself, day two ""feeling disoriented"" little voice back head saying:.. ""If call now.. die"". 

I can't imagine attempting make coherent decisions 70% less O2.. Jesus. assume dont spouse kids love yourself. He's making suggestions live covid. ITT: cool redditors mocking successful community boycott started company deciding longer pandemic happens don‚Äôt make deadline? think they‚Äôre lazy dragging feet? Ugh hope whole decade like Isn‚Äôt guy said we‚Äôd three weeks ago, five weeks ago? Same, sick 1 day. day rough though. admitted hospital, hospital staff may treat you. pretty much universal across USA. Unfortunately, Delta happened. We'd lot better Delta. new virus many refused vaccinated, we're worse place ever many states (in particular region Texas Florida). Eventually, get it, gonna take time so. 

On plus side, seem infections (at least non-Delta) produce robust immune response (I think data Delta yet, might hold up) third doses make vaccine nearly effective Measles vaccine (and measles much much much contagious). tools end pandemic. matter using them. Another lame post keep trolls alive Oh get sometimes take great burdens upon us Blaming symptoms obesity. Excellent. 

Can‚Äôt take people like seriously decent conversation matter. astounded read headline saying people STILL pointing obesity instead virus causing pandemic.

Dear America, 

What fuck?

Sincerely, 

Someone America EU strict export controls

The EU controlled exports AZ vaccine beggining year, fulfilling contracts EU. still, beggining year, world's biggest exporter vaccines. Norway. Getting military help seems bit excessive considering symptoms worse get yearly flu.. Like go back stay home anyway I'm well tested? testing help me? want spend resources unnecessarily there's people probably needs help like me. Yes comrade radiologic technician. apologies comrade radiologic technician best suggestion (and please don‚Äôt take snarky) turn news. Honestly, life basically goes back normal. want personal agency heal ailment. people using crystals cure cancer. Kind of. day me, looks like I'll still get vax'd pregnant I'll eligible booster 3rd trimester. least data vaccine safety pregnancy even months ago, getting booster easy decision. though. Don‚Äôt give dtap booster vaccine you‚Äôre pregnant? start taking prenatal vitamins frequently use OTC prescription medicine morning sickness. There‚Äôs medications OB could prescribe needed too‚Äîlike women take insulin get gestational diabetes. It‚Äôs ordinary seek medical treatment intervention you‚Äôre pregnant. Yes. restaurant retail, teachers professional. read stories store managers teachers live Thier cars. Sure many make more, COL eats up.
Some also ""live"" away find affordable housing. lived 2.5 hours previous job. knew guy lived 3. would sleep cubicle go home weekends.  ‚Äúfuck that.‚Äù 

All point even worse trend people actually reading article instead headline hecklers. one reason misinformation bad.  idiotic. anti vaccine people Republicans, small government, etc, yet Regeneron treatments, paid government least 10 times vaccines. thinking you‚Äôre unvaccinated, pay treatment, unless Medical reason take vaccine. Don‚Äôt realize gets paid tax dollars? tax dollars? Assholes. 

 tired selfish people don‚Äôt give damn big picture. wonder many people heifer infected way. really don‚Äôt care whether FDA approves anything, it‚Äôs part kool aid right fed them. Ingest bleach, that‚Äôs fine, horse wormer, sure, that‚Äôs winner. Hate immigrants, hell think families got here?  quote Forrest Gump ‚Äústupid stupid does‚Äù. There's already database record possible vaccine side effects.

The thing want already exists decades you. located? Ireland, called GP contacted testing centre. transport start pandemic, military helped transport.  area legit want that. Would suck money already tight budget. 
I know someone second pfizer jab January fast forward week covid laid it. think report numbers county weekly. seems like update statewide numbers 5x week. referring ""vaccine hesitant"" remark. I'm going assume ending. Right, unusual. Okay looks like would motivation vaccine opposed constant test. 
The unfortunate thing testing still need ongoing process vaccinated not. I‚Äôm betting he‚Äôs vaccinated appease investors. May, CDC estimated [1 Covid infections reported.

That ratio may different today, likely different Florida country whole, there's doubting there's lot people caught Covid Florida went got tested. program done harm good. Rental prices almost doubled cannot find place people staying put. Landlords also way strict scared people going get pay. everyone paying credit destroyed never able rent again. policy meant well didnt work well practice. I‚Äôm nurse northeast. march/April/May almost every COVID positive person saw unvaxxed returning Florida. Women encouraged vaccinate pregnancy time. Source: woman vaccinated TDAP flu three pregnancies. also received covid vaccine recent pregnancy.  Both. Deltas viral load way higher. 

A booster delta didn‚Äôt result better results original vaccine, it‚Äôs probably active antibodies dropping, viral load delta jetzt absurdly high break through. Yow America. ever-loving ***fuck*** wrong you!?

--Sincerely, concerned European  likely though. seven day moving average new cases Florida stable nearly three weeks now: Wow, that's terrible. endangers teachers many others too. one took personally someone pointed recent news trend, lol. Gladys' priority always protecting business. Business desperate Christmas dollar. son tested positive last Monday(he mild symptoms). According school website, 2 kids ""impacted"", whatever means. know wear mask time interacts kids, way 2 kids. Stop ridiculousness. ""Should worried"" last Mayo Clinic Q&amp;A video.  Yep, totally temporary. damn time. visit post office twice week, bugging while. plastic shields going stop Delta circulating. Imagine losing reelection killed constituents. Classic judge things isn‚Äôt news, it‚Äôs clickbait. basically top ten list masquerading news article. literally almost difference two examples given. misleading hyperbolic, clickbait. word ‚Äúthese‚Äù enough. outrage misplaced. stop reading headlines read article. No, would nice see anecdotal accounts would pile start statistically significant barring someone weirdo creating bots give fake accounts side effects something. Right standard reporting procedure, really rare. extremely bad ones probably pretty rare, I'm protected something measured weeks 2nd dose, would probably prefer something effective. Governor DeSantis bubble. refuses see happening, recognize importance safety protocols public health emergency.

We need new governor, new legislature. One hold governor accountable. essentially, covid cases dropping people dying. Keep mind people courts ruled defunding. wannabe presidential candidate defying courts, Republican him. ""These five states have"" standard clickbait syntax. past might simply said ""Five states have"", listed abbreviations.

Your headline sucks. thoughts anti vaxxers west? would interesting hear perspective. Hospitals transferring patients different hospitals within given state even states instances.

This news article, health resource. several websites people use check availability within given county city. School Boards official right make dress codes even mandate vaccines (some earliest case law school law school's rights mandate vaccines pursue truancy cases parents whose children vaccinated attending school) federal level state level states, including FL (you find info constitution online actually cede good deal power local Boards writing). Boards deciding it, done equivalent school level passing law reasonable methods. process. decline according Death Sentence actually decline?  one alarmed. intention alarmist? rare side effects hundreds millions doses given isn‚Äôt cause alarm. go doctor. So? ur afraid death? I'm definitely afraid unknown. go wherever rivers flowing.  ‚ÄúIf ‚Äòpeak‚Äô, learned nothing.

The implication shouldn‚Äôt peak, antivaxxers deniers suffer more, they‚Äôll learn something. Covid likely post viral syndrome

Yes, which, again, incredibly generic term standard definition vastly different meanings different people. makes zero sense use guide policy sense something like ""oh can't open post viral syndrome"". deal flu every year *still* exactly know post viral syndrome is. I'd assume covid.

What mean ""try get covid""? We're talking public health policies here. also ""try get flu"" mean live life. know ahah love name! odd effects. sure didn‚Äôt mini-stroke instead? Go neurologist. side effect it‚Äôs extremely rare doctor know advise second shot.

It‚Äôs odd getting vaccinated. guess aren‚Äôt US. Even reason wear mask. stated beginning exception N95 masks, prevent spreading it, getting it. isn‚Äôt useful. you‚Äôre Tampa 20% ICU beds left, it‚Äôs someone Tallahassee Miami pop right over.

Here NC close less 10% ICU availability, counties 1-2 hospitals already overflowing isn‚Äôt another hospital hours. Gonna get boosted tomorrow. I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know Yes complex picture. things remember hospitalisations death rates lower % known cases previously. testing much last year? not, missing lot cases.

And finally, compared countries, haven‚Äôt really vaccinated enough people really see benefits vaccines unlike Denmark etc. never expected virus would die out. Also, places real, effective lockdowns. Vaccination still best plan needs high level uptake. developed world isn‚Äôt close needed level. They‚Äôre refrigeration trucks, pretty standard. commonly used following natural disasters cause mass casualties. I've never understood people even mean ""masks work"" obviously offer protection least distance water particles cough sneeze. can't possibly deny that. they're 0% effective. amount protection offer going helpful. 80%? 60% even masks 10% effective, interaction 10 people, would 65% chance preventing least one getting it. You‚Äôre replacing half band mid tour hired guns 0 time rehearsals. I‚Äôm live sound guy, shit ain‚Äôt happening. Replacing one person someone you‚Äôve worked before? Sure. Happens time. Sound checks take god damn forever figure shit develop chemistry. half band filled people that‚Äôve never played together 0 rehearsals?? Fuck no. You‚Äôd god damn worst shows you‚Äôve since first started career. way shows continue switch acoustic like said thought about. Proved point. get vaccinated cheaper long run deficit little chance they‚Äôll need laying floor library. 

Not fully approved exact argument people like getting vaccinated. ok getting treatment, none fully approved FDA. Still worse. need constant tests actually catch them. weekly test far good.

Negative 1 day could positive case next won‚Äôt catch week straight. I‚Äôm east TN every single Walgreens, CVS, fast pace/quick clinic full people getting tested schedule appointment Wednesday 6pm get tested. feel like bag ass sure got Covid-19 coworker works right top right can‚Äôt anything it. work wants stay home gives 4 sick days year I‚Äôm plague rat factory. Either that, want handle physical cards. Mobile delivery orders also means eliminate cash drive thru. seen cash elimination days. helps cash drawers counted closed out, may eliminate need security truck day (for coins bills). what's world's plan Delta?

I mean, first plan lock virus dies out. became clear viable, plan became develop vaccine vaccinate many people possible develop herd immunity. much developed world mostly vaccinated, delta cases rise again.

What's humanity's next plan? countries reintroducing new restrictions, what's end goal? Considering revaccination still widely recommended, hope basically carry pandemic somehow dies own, like every pandemic history world did? Rapid Test, better 1 PCR Test week. need constant testing negative test day literally positive 1 day later. 3 tests week kinda needed catch infections. 

Yea, vaccinated kids, Germany testing kids like whole past year, mask mandates well, obviously. Germany, hospitals reducing total number beds keep percentage high funding.  Again, clearly operating erratic definition ""preventable"" makes entirely impossible reason you. 

I think basically everyone would agree society conception germ theory, sewer systems modern sanitation far less effective reducing harm pandemic today. fact actually arguing contrary straight face *wild*.

For another morsel perspective: still occasional outbreaks plague today. They're big deal, live filth days. That‚Äôs clickbait title. aren‚Äôt necessarily going put five states title. You‚Äôre supposed read fucking article comment headline. aren't. They've yelling ""stop masking kids"" months non-stop. Souvenir cases surely thing. high profile case/death small town next door FL case brought home.  also know 3 separate families bought home cases suburban western pa weren‚Äôt really spike. Taking medicine simply ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs available‚Äù isn‚Äôt medical industry works.

I 100% agree point need least open idea 3rd shot might harm good (not even discussing diminishing marginal value 3rd shot compared 1st shot unvaccinated person) 

That said, taking medicine ""because available"" actually, unfortunately, common (though be). Antibiotics bronchitis (largely caused viruses), example, unfortunately quite common easier prescribe 10 minute conversation patient would rather hear it, give terrible review, go another doctor next time. country champ, go lecture public health measures adopt accommodate entitled american tourists chick fil bad double covid. One switched triple drive thru.  Hopefully get control, importantly, hopefully speed vaccination drive. 21% fully vaccinated point pathetic first world country.

The US literally throwing away expiring doses, yet New Zealand enough. get point? think CIA investigated kind claims regarding earlier cases Europe. recall, took longer vaccines cleared pregnant women, seems like change quite set yet. understand added hesitation there's perceived risk fetus. Ironically, virus appears pose far greater risk pregnancy. quite sad really. can't find blame them. OK vaccine given sites provider agreement limits use FDA allows, according CDC sites give boosters jeopardize ability continue getting vaccine . Also given outside use vaccinator liability protection aren‚Äôt covered vaccine injury pandemic vaccine compensation program. insurance wouldn‚Äôt reimburse administration. CDC official speaking ACIP meeting today.

Also data early boost would provide durable benefit. 3 4 dose vaccines boost earlier 6 months. get mixed up. miner cave 6 years ago.  Damn make good point live UT mask mandate lockdown many people believe it‚Äôs BS‚Ä¶. restaraunts pretty far indoor dining. Certainly chains like McDonald‚Äôs. many daily cases shelter work ever average. spike beginning last pandemic, average shit fucked protective measures higher they‚Äôve ever been. 

Especially instant testing widely available vaccines‚Ä¶ health department vaccinating people twice week shelters site, sort local ‚Äúhomeless clinic‚Äù another twice week mobile van. Ya know, WALTUH, hurt someone watchin back Exactly problem. CDC response previous current administrations pretty atrocious. Everyone blames Republicans mess objectively pretty awful across board, bright spots. There's excuse things handled delta gained foothold. Nearly every state dropped emergency measures delta growing. wife got shots third trimester we‚Äôre glad did. bad side effects baby protection would without it. She‚Äôs also breastfeeding he‚Äôs safe without vaccinated. He‚Äôs 3 months old great! don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre beds, capacity pandemic still going strong ever rising, there‚Äôd new patient replace dying/recovering. Hospitalizations actually peak August 19th around 17,250. they‚Äôre 15,750. useful thing hospitalization data don‚Äôt need look 7 day average discern trend reporting complete updated daily, current trend Florida downward.   scared tactics think 2 seconds. Hospitalizations always last behind case numbers... conservatives say covid real threat /s  Yeah came back summer take baby walks go parks hours every day it‚Äôs struggle hold gym people take em back instantly surprised many people still play.

Everyone got 4 shots. Two thirds participants received actual vaccine first series. Nobody knew got cross give got placebo actual vaccine 2/3rd already vaccinated got placebo. Constant daily reporting everyone helps determine side effects efficacy vaccine. daily reporting, regular follow-ups continue two years.
So everyone trial received vaccine. know first series second there's virtually side effects. well fall winter coming Drive-thrus might profitable per customer served, I'd curious know (a) loss number customers closing dining room service (b) many customers served per hour via drive-thrus vs dining room + drive-thrus? I'm surprised all.

Getting really high fever key stages pregnancy really bad news baby. 2nd dose vaccine causes really high fever lot cases.

My wife timed vaccine got 1st dose still pregnant, 2nd dose delivery. pregnant friends taking all, plan soon deliver. Absolutely right! Kept waiting Mankind cage disappointed. need this. According NYT change things much vaxx. recommendation member states restrict unvaxx. Got stuck abroad due family issues. Canada crazy numbers country safe. Finally got paperwork done come back home family, son's birth certificate finished. going bananas cases longer able, safe, travel main city fly home. Plus paper work wife plane ticket like 10k. Vaccine looks like six months away minimum. Hopefully Canada send vaccines consulates abroad help citizens stuck abroad. Like french Chinese far. latest RSV strain joke. house got send wife ER sepsis pneumonia ( 102F, Resting heart rate 110). fine crazy scary. God love innuendo. Fucking brilliant. harambe tho? Chick-fil-A‚Äôs near always double triple drive pre-Covid. It‚Äôs crazy much business  agree, whole pandemic case study poor science communication. Yet comment say people still playing this? okay???   I‚Äôll walk dog nearest stop 1.5mi away still interact anyone see. ;) I'm willing give pregnant women little slack taking vaccine yet. first vaccine EUA issued December 11, 2020, less 9 months ago. babies people got vaccine first weeks pregnancy even born yet. McDonald‚Äôs work lobby usually closed think solidarity people countries weren‚Äôt impacted change made difference. really appreciated it. Would make sense AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer make vaccine mandated day one.   actually every time. time different. always thought ICU beds typically around 80% full. Someone tell guy yes, please try start civil war. get go prison goodness sake, get along lives peace vaccination 60% effective preventing infection Delta, defined 'much greater' becomes important issue.

Besides that, reinfection scenario people; whether that's result undiagnosed immune condition rotten luck, know. every single way, culture reeks like shit

Force fed enough day, enough choke it

You know got voice everytime lose

Who needs freedom choice without choice choose?

Televisions on, sings old song

There's room left truth

And leaders claim try they've got shifty eyes

When asking proof

With backs wall

It's getting clearer we've got things prove

Is be? Trusting futility noose

Get joke, problem ain't system's broke

In fact working well

We fight way can, middle finger man

Laughing way

And happen time, cast ballot thinking

things change time

Politicians live dollar signs, career choices govern lives

I tell about

Your future, cause, rights fair, sickness bad either think you‚Äôll hospitalized? vaccines sadly won‚Äôt prevent COVID rise Delta, they‚Äôre supposed eliminate serious risk. Exactly! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Young people generally extremely safe covid, obviously still get vaccine since statistics support this. Fear mongering comments like necessary. Floridians dumb? agree prohibiting restrictions foolish somewhere over-reaction turning political statement.

Last year school district tried put together plan classroom included lots restrictions. Half kids would go alternating days, desks 6+ feet apart, still computers even classroom (so teachers required come in), classroom monitors (separate teachers) make sure kids kept masks stayed socially distant, interleaved bell schedules middle high school decrease number kids halls, group seating lunch, etc etc.

However something like 30-40% families opted ridiculous circus worse remote learning. led every classroom 1/3 person 2/3 remote disrupted classes. kids say learned nothing goofed entire time. developed anxiety, depression, mental health social issues, many retake classes summer, causing families cancel vacations.

So balance somewhere kids go classroom make semi-normal. never understood simply vaccinating teachers letting families opt sufficient. many media reports high cases hardest hit areas ICU beds short supply. Yep. Round contempt. [clinical still recruiting. finished end year. No, censorship actual misinformation good. Ignorant/malicious mods bad. baby two weeks ago. got vaccinated second trimester encouragement OBGYN.

So yes frustrating doesn‚Äôt help comes stopping ignorance anti-vaxxers that‚Äôs simply well informed well read. 

But part process, dealing coronavirus almost 2 years. 

This going straight line problem solution. everyone, I'm 36 Male diabetic 50 BMI. 2nd Pfizer shot 2 weeks ago.

What opinions chances severe case covid, given health?


I may exposed someone it.



I know normal healthy people gotten vaccine done pretty well catching delta. However, I'm normal healthy person.

If it, chances severe case shoot drastically BMI diabetes, even though I've 2 vaccines?  Holy cow, general expectations safety-vetting vaccines gotten crazy. Almost every vaccine history - boosters - needed much smaller well evidence/data safety widely approved. covid vaccines intensely studied vaccines ever. data set never complete, numbers never perfectly analyzed. We‚Äôre starting get ridiculous. know don‚Äôt double blinded studies effectiveness parachutes? wouldn‚Äôt based decisions preprint yet peer reviewed.  great indicator whether contagious. use determine know whether need stay home quarantine family member. Wasn‚Äôt 2013 MERS outbreak?  Vaccinations increased 77.2% since July 20. course one keep news radar also keep mind doom sells.

Betteridge's law headlines adage states: ""Any headline ends question mark answered word no."" named Ian Betteridge, British technology journalist wrote 2009, although principle much older. Yes, according Dr. Michael Mina, doesn‚Äôt matter symptomatic symptomatic, tests pick high viral load. point, since virus endemic, feel countries lock similarly Australia NZ, every time there‚Äôs uptick cases, forever?

You realize long term consequences that? see 5% mortality? could missed it, think article said anything 5% mortality. said 5.3 hospitalizations per 100k among vaccinated population, 0.0053% vaccinated population (and that's hospitalizations, deaths/mortality) studies show relatively serious long term health conditions happen people got seriously ill, generally older people health conditions. idea young healthy person get covid, get seriously ill symptoms, kind long term health conditions. appear happening.   know classroom important include zero precautions else lose funding? already layoff hundreds teachers last year, help kids? nothing? years interruptions Florida, initial interruption it. We've back person last year exposed risk get tossed like we're garbage.

I'm sorry speaking anger last night though. sister family *are* vaccinated. They're still worried, be. What? hell draw conclusion delta variant must've created basis random internet dictionary says butterflies? possess brain? sounds accurate. Preventing infection may aim people actually developing vaccines, certainly media narrative blasted US initial efficacy numbers released. talk ‚Äúpreventing hospitalization‚Äù became talking point delta took became clear vaccines weren‚Äôt going super great preventing baseline infection. conversation shifted, it, general population‚Äôs messaging expect. What‚Äôs end game crime? poverty? What‚Äôs end goal pollution? Famine, war?

Right isn‚Äôt end game. It‚Äôs called living virus means wearing masks, social distancing, event cancellations, vaccine campaigns spread ‚Äúhigh substantial,‚Äù able relax enjoy months reduced mitigation spread becomes low moderate.

Do like it? get vaccinated, get friends vaccinated, get family vaccinated.

The people get vaccinated decoupled cases hospitalization &amp; death other. Well ""denialist"" difference ""case"", illness, serious illness. Kids generally getting sick, suspect small number 10,000 kids symptoms all, I'm surprised tracked reported obviously important. think lot people simply know assume risk kids adults worry 500 kids going end dead something, statistically true. cases declining vaccination efforts Delta burned population? plan moving Florida years mom retires (wife works mom thing keeping job).

Weve planning move NC prepping Oregon trip considered moving saw costs compared NC.

Either way, need Florida remember vaccine recommended pregnant women since January public data probably even accurate. least backdating deaths date diagnosis appear *always* trending down, publishing inaccurate data last year. straight jump new cases lasted couple days followed drop straight seems *highly* suspicious given know/can prove now, maybe me. large sample size, would cool data results, practically happening limited staffing mass layoffs spring. Maybe organization involved studying it, could data. 

Our vaccination rates community high enough count that. That's hospitals bad shape. threatening defund us school board listened advice local hospitals meeting put place 30 day mask mandate cruel- community can't handle now. I'm sorry situation worry. also kids though older, wife teaches preschool, many concerns.

There currently way get small kids vaccinated, time infinitesimal risk getting seriously ill exposed. carriers, though chance much higher symptoms.

My wife friends colleagues vaccinated deal roomfuls unvaccinated preschool kids every day. kids age sense personal space can't reliably wear mask. basically exposed day long. Masks hard enforce reliability. rely vaccinations older family members kids.

I trying shame anyone ask risks are. pandemic started lot unknowns. stage lot data lot known possible ""follow science"". fortunate kids little risk. SARS example inverted, risk kids higher adults.

Under agreement 500,000 doses expected arrive distribution next week, Australia send amount Singapore December.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said vaccines would additional 4.5 million doses Pfizer one million Moderna shots expected arrive month.

""That means 500,000 doses extra happen September otherwise would wait several months now,"" told reporters Canberra Tuesday.


The vaccines distributed based population 159,236 set NSW 131,149 heading Victoria.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese continues accuse government securing enough doses failing establish diverse vaccine portfolio.

The opposition argues slow rollout left Australia behind almost every developed country world.

""Why prime minister take responsibility fact Australia's economic recovery always hostage failures vaccines quarantine?"" Mr Albanese told parliament

Mr Morrison said ""irons fire"" vaccine deals.

He said Singapore doses would accelerate vaccination rollout Australia pursues vaccination coverage targets 70 80 per cent population aged 16 above.

WA Premier Mark McGowan argues opening borders states virus would cost hundreds lives 70 per cent coverage.

The prime minister toned criticism states wary releasing restrictions lower threshold, saying understood people wanted cautious.

One problems amount utilized study straight lethal dosage humans. sub created 2013? 2020? number reasons older peoples‚Äô immune systems weaker. Think long takes wounds heal bad bruise fall versus younger person. Numerous bodily processes slow time.

It‚Äôs specific magic number though, fit 80 year olds unhealthy 60 year olds. It‚Äôs feasible check titers every person see NEED booster so, general, sooner older folks less soon young healthy patients probably right booster recommendation. Good thing there‚Äôs holiday weekend coming Statistically virus affect kids much wondering many 10,000 symptoms got sick, suspect low asked, large sample size.

I agree disagree governor kids getting sick people worried about? symptomatic likely can't even spread others, parents household vaccinated, safe too. Everyone worried kids schools sure anything specific, vague fear virus. hate Desantis consider also insane amount people moved FL well simply people became voting age since then. Would hilarious lost small margin half state full morons knows. guess delay really work children. Likely one children died trial screwed risk/reward calculation. suddenly went private overnight uk, Ontario median age ICU stay went ~9 days covid classic, 55 days delta. UKs ICU still climbing peak 2 months ago.

Some definitely shift age infected (my regions ~99% people 70 fully vaccinated, getting infected younger younger. younger person going ICU, longer takes leave don‚Äôt die within days). 

So don‚Äôt know Florida‚Äôs vaccination rates, age average person icu. Maybe die hospital numbers drop fast. Maybe hold miserable 2 months lives, you‚Äôll continue see system collapse November even cases decrease. Good times. dumb joke can‚Äôt believe summer already lie needed, write reason, it‚Äôs ‚Äòoff key‚Äô, aren‚Äôt doctor. PS: lawyer either. little, late. girlfriend tested positive yesterday showing symptoms late last friday. fully vaccinated, super well bad cough nausea, could much worse gotten vaccine. 

As me, B-Lined nearest clinic rapid test available. I'm fully vaccinated, I've symptoms, ilI came back negative. i'm feeling symptoms time week, im gonna go back get another test case. 

For now, girlfriend sleeping seperate rooms, gonna curbside delivery sorts leaving stuff needs door.  see, thanks. Thanks, that‚Äôs important distinction, though fair, 2020 certainly seemed like lot political media figures sending message covid would ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù. Moderna. Second shot days ago. It‚Äôs absolutely destroyed me, beats hell getting Covid! WHO‚ÄôS HOT BABY LETS GO!  TIL! Yeah many many Americans difference J&amp;J days weeks months.  refused opportunity get J&amp;J fir family knew we‚Äôd get spot mRNA vaccine within week (which did- moderna except 1 Pfizer ).  friends j&amp;j air boosters (I think it‚Äôll get worked soon). 

When consulted aunt (an actual virologist) spent long career developing maintaining America‚Äôs smallpox vaccine stockpile feelings concurred. difference months fine. days.  Sure, official recommendation. friend works covid microbiologist said exactly that. wait 6 months CDC catch up. they're love doses now. momma needs medicine...  Moderna rough. Fortunately medical mj stayed medicated whole time (after second, third expect worse get one). Made life much easier. 101 documented cases since May, UK health minister stated believes already extinct lineage Delta outcompetes it. 

They even talk possibly dying article OP linked. wife got fizer never got covid.

Nice authoritarian country floriduh... see going that, web page tells indirectly moderate cases involve hospitalization. section moderate cases, says (emphasis mine), ""See 'Therapeutic Management *Nonhospitalized* Adults COVID-19' recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2‚Äìspecific therapy.""

Which makes sense believe term ""clinical"" refers type medical care, ranging regular doctor's office visits way hospitalization. (A clinician medical professional treats patients, opposed research something.)

It weird definition seems say moderate cases exist unless observed medical professional. think article written medical professionals dealing patients, think meant say anything situations medical professional involved. trying tell handle are.

This study demonstrated significantly higher humoral immunogenicity SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), infected well uninfected participants, across age categories. higher mRNA content mRNA-1273 compared BNT162b2 longer interval priming boosting mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks BNT162b2) might explain difference.

A relationship neutralization level SARS-CoV-2 vaccination protection COVID-19 demonstrated several studies.4 such, height humoral response vaccination, correlates neutralizing antibody titers,5 might clinically relevant.

Limitations study include lack data cellular immunity neutralizing antibodies, well specific focus health care workers.

They died. think they're giving exemptions fabric ass US default given Reddit American website. Yeah I'm pretty sure lots studies showed Pfizer effective vaccine moderna terms efficacy preventing serious illness covid exposed patients. Yet look single article centered around antibodies Moderna immediately flip script. Pfizer suggested 3 week dose spacing 6 weeks apart. It‚Äôs better wait longer Anecdotally plays out. kids got COVID. wife Pfizer vaccinated got COVID. childcare provider J&amp;J vaccinated got COVID. Moderna sailed right through. Reminds pill mill doctors. ending some. Challenge Accepted went get mine April, mass-vax site pulled in, went left Pfizer, right Moderna. reading time, felt like Moderna's better choice (don't remember reasoning knows really valid), went right. I've happy choice, although second dose hit **hard** night. total efficacy Delta showing quite lot higher Pfizer's well, that's another bonus. I'm little perplexed, last Tuesday found 2 YO daughter exposed school. wife vaccinated daughter obviously not. go quarantine, shows little way symptoms. Slightly runny nose, minor infrequent cough allergies completely normal. Saturday, wife wakes feeling great, take home test negative. wakes Sunday feeling worse. take daughter Sunday rapid test, positive. wife, symptomatic, goes doctor says definitely it, need pay rapid let's PCR test result, definitely it. go following day (Monday) same. Monday wife's symptoms worse. achy, trouble breathing times, feels like gets run-over truck sense taste dulled. wakes morning still feeling bad decides get Regeneron done. afternoon feeling much better. meantime I've developed cough feel fatigued, everyone talk says sound rough. feel terrible, 100% either. seems it.

Then afternoon wife's tests came back negative. could 100% believe don't, symptoms minor enough allergies impact cooped past week. wife's symptoms line directly covid, two doctors, one saw Sunday one Regeneron facility said covid. would think tested early, symptomatic point. False negative? Vaccine keeping viral load nose down?

Should test again? Obviously going continue quarantine positive daughter, seems weird. ""Ok, die"" Moderna gang! ‚Äúnegative health consequences‚Äù wearing masks governor speaks of? something target vaccine.

Isn't whole point Moderna effective higher dosage, seems result greater antibody presence, *exactly* stops higher viral loads?

That is, literally target vaccine making high-dosage RNA shot. help :D biggest pet peeve that‚Äôs circulated mainstream media recently? incorrect really think it? Thanks! Well 28% population ineligible see exactly possible Israel's fault. vax rate among eligible populations much success compared majority world. Unless covid mortality increases substantially amongst children, country going approve drug without serious studies looking end year earliest. I'm sure are, Florida best track record reporting accurate data. people come yet another endgame that.

No, wouldn't. people dying long long-term post viral sequelae numbers higher illnesses. conspiracy theory style thinking. understand people want lockdown, enough resume normal life. people moved on.

There nothing ""normal"" living long covid. Hopefully people moved find hard way.  They‚Äôll definitely work better mask mandates hardly ever worn correctly bit later average, honestly time decided looked lives weekends, etc, seriously fine change. Going bars wasn‚Äôt really fun anymore, sitting around playing video games watching tv getting old. went lot great vacations hit top bucket list. time could really see would like weekend soccer games, etc. cause eventually sound fun. burn means humanity time adapt.

Well yes, also no.

The Cold War slow burn too. Humanity time adapt resolve crisis. nukes ever flew, cooked. 

The Cold War one possible failure mode. One possible crisis avert. Climate change cascading series crises. one problem need adapt prepare for. near infinite problems know they'll strike late. Drought, refugee crisis, political instability, war, wildfires, hurricanes, heat waves, widespread power outages, polar vortices, gulf stream stopping, pandemics, food chain collapse, nuclear war, etc. 

I'm well aware technologies used mitigate effects climate change use today. I'm also well aware that, present, woefully insufficient prevent widespread loss human habitat destruction. dancing end world since end Second World War. moment, real possibility complete utter nuclear holocaust would annihilate entire world. fact, many instances almost - stopped handful people, single person. Cuban Missile Crisis, Norwegian Rocket Incident, 1983 Soviet false alarm incident three examples this. 

In 1983 Soviet false alarm incident, single man determined outcome humanity. radar computers detected salvo five nuclear missiles headed towards Soviet Union. Thinking pre-emptive nuclear strike would involve thousands missiles, made tough decision - five missiles likely error. decided real attack, Soviet pre-emptive attack strategy held vast majority Soviet nuclear arsenal launched United States immediately. world could ended there, didn't. 

What I'm saying is, human race stranger catastrophes. countless challenges us past, countless challenges future. firmly believe will, past, either narrowly avoid destruction find way rise ashes even better before.

The majority vaccinated get break cases need infused monoclonal antibodies Yeah. ""pandemic hot-tub"" would better ""tinderbox"" since everything wet now. Same, aome reason feom beginning wanted Moderna... know im glad  many faces, little leopard time. please cite source claims? understanding Israeli data month 6 efficacy Delta variant begins taper quite dramatically, legitimate science indicated booster Pfizer Moderna, especially 60 immunocompromised. increasingly likely humanity never reach population 9 billion, let alone 11 billion. Almost every metric population growth decline, even Africa, even bringing nations seeing actual population decline. *before* COVID-19. mean, got Pfizer, that's first one could get. glad getting J&amp;J seemed slightly less effective read (although still well worth getting, especially option nothing) really care Pfizer vs. Moderna. guess I'm little disappointed looks like Moderna better even knowing know I'd still taken first one available me. expecting fellow countrymen see this, they‚Äôll demand access Moderna, don‚Äôt have.  in-law there, working Cal-Fire. may one crews. idea others like, buddies I've met ant-vaccine, COVID hoaxers.

I hope makes back. Truly good guy. Welp guess good thing wife got Moderna shots EENVEENCEEBULL! noted mask ban doesn‚Äôt affect children private school mandated masks. live least one pharmacy covid antibodies tests - maybe could test done see antibodies level is?  That's big part problem. unvaccinated evenly distributed throughout population tend group together clusters even high percentage general population vaccinated, clusters unvaxxed people still vulnerable wave infections once, lucked better two!  mom trying get pfizer heard side effects worse moderna. figured gives covid-like reaction, must giving antibodies. seems make sense see does.

Anecdotal, person know got J&amp;J shot got Covid much worse reaction disease. think touched huge theme discussed. lack faith society. parents need rely ""village."" last years told us squarely cannot trust community support. really rough here, feel you. hoping find people help share burdens with.  can't get cancer suffer autism coronavirus dead, man partially correct. Oh. Okay. thought specific information medical danger under-50's getting booster. talking resistance risks. 

I'm convinced one way vaccine resistant mutations likely come unvaccinated. 

I see point replication = chances mutations. piece undeniable. 

But there's also case made large population vaccinated people applies selective pressure favor mutations vaccine resistant. example, caught covid (am vaccinated) virus mutated way conferred vaccine resistance, I'm going pass resistant version others. version originally caught going well supressed. pass others. Or, picked resistant strain, course I'm going pass one along well supressed either. 

So there's also risk letting virus run uncontrolled vaccinated population (with waning antibodies) presents danger creating vaccine resistant mutation spreads population. arm sore last night, side effects. know 17 breakthrough infections Pfizer vaccine, zero breakthroughs moderna. Nearly pandemic deaths unvaccinated people now. we‚Äôre back 1k deaths/day. ~20,000 people attitude dead three weeks‚Ä¶  Moderna vaccine 100mcg, Pfizer vaccine 30mcg. it.  booster side effect (if any) compare first 2 shots? Oklahoma begun tracking breakthrough cases brand vaccine, month onset age group. Page 9-10 contains available weekly redundant info! people come yet another endgame that.

What enough resume normal life. people moved on. guess one way cull sociopaths society . . . time comes us get booster shots, received Pfizer vaccine first time around seek Moderna booster? even work like that? Another case anecdotal evidence, friends parents got Moderna breakthrough cases; got J&amp;J took care never got sick. positioning primary race, general. That's drives DeSantis strategy ""no vaccine passport"" mandate mask mandates (oh, irony). assumption long snag primary win, 50/50 divide gives legitimate shot 270 electoral votes. That's sad state we're today...

In case clear, I'm fan DeSantis, live FL.

Sorry - way political rules sub.  There‚Äôs compelling medical exemption masked. asthma &amp; bilateral pulmonary fibrosis wear mask, problem. already latter.  mean, will. want see US medical bill looks like get sick. ER visit set back couple grand insurance.

Florida record-high number hospitalizations statewide. know covid-related hospitalizations usually lag several weeks, even community case counts plateau start dropping. ‚ÄúICU use still high, cases start drop, still contending ill individuals hospital COVID-19 intensive care,‚Äù said Mary Mayhew, Florida Hospital Association. ‚ÄúIt going take time see decrease COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped 300 day last five **If trend continues, won‚Äôt mid-October state would dip 2,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations total.** Totally agree, I'm worried people took Pfizer taking upon rush lie get Moderna booster, shenanigans like that. suing doctors vaccination centers giving ""wrong"" vaccine, blaming relatives etc.

Both vaccines still effective severe disease. took Pfizer may take booster bit earlier.

I doubt cases dropping 250/week dying, could 21,000 cases week. [Florida hospitalisations drop 3,000 outbreak 10, 2020, Financial Times) Uh, I'm pretty sure Canada get many people get first jab possible supplies limited, intentional strategy thinking vaccines may work better larger timeframe shots. Y'know, Pfizer vax first rolled out, remember bunch health care professionals bragging many doses could draw vial. Like, thiiiiink vials supposed hold 4 5 doses (can't remember) bragging could get 7 8 doses vial. 

As long patient got arms, gravy them. patting back stretching (at time) limited supplies.

Wonder feel decisions now, turns dose amount actually super important, even correct dose, Pfizer still lacking tad. that's true. real world consequences. Men's sizes range larger.

The vaccine choice real world consequences too.

There fewer breakthrough cases Moderna.

Just true every individual mean stat without predictive power. talking federal government. CDC's job provide guidance, explained another comment. Suddenly less upset 6th lockdown Melbourne. 

We 2 deaths today state Covid. first year. we're losing minds home-schooling, look much worse things could be. Another couple months we'll 80% double vaccinated, open knowing full ICU beds.  Belgium mostly 5 week interval Pfizer 55 days, wtf! Even so, could make measles rare today old vaccines, 2e tackle well. limit much mutations do. Eventually tradeoff virus must make things like immune escape, ace2 binding affinity, mortality. Mortality selected directly. change spike much avoid immune system, virus may able bind cells well. I'm saying get worse gets better ability create new highly effective vaccines within months, tools even deal worse variant.

There people already working pan-covid vaccines (that work broadly variants), nasal inhaled vaccines (which help tremendously preventing infection), vaccines stable longer without freezers (making mass vaccination areas much easier). time gen3/4 vaccines widely available, hopefully already covid control world. new variants, there's still hope. biggest hurdle antivaxers, they've already got strong immunity severe disease previous infections, that's really problem long-term. bigger problem flooding hospitals short term costs getting immunity. I‚Äôm dumb explain Spain one highest per capita given strong vaccination numbers are? 70% fully vaccinated. testament Florida's reporting hijinks true trend. plateaued, still higher last 4 weeks ever previously.

Let's pretend simply masks keeping lid transmission Australia.

Everyone South America wearing mask. Mask compliance Peru 100%, entire time, since early March 2020, huge fines anyone caught public without one. Peru worst outbreak world. Argentina.

If r0 Delta 6 (and accounts, lot higher), masks reduce transmission 60%, masks alone lead rT 2.4 -- way higher flu, almost high original strain Covid without mitigation.

In US, 7-day average Aug. 31, 2020, 42,000.

A terrible storm came town local officials sent emergency warning riverbanks would soon overflow flood nearby homes. ordered everyone town evacuate immediately.

A faithful Christian man heard warning decided stay, saying himself, ‚ÄúI trust God danger, God send divine miracle save me.‚Äù

The neighbors came house said him, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving room car, please come us!‚Äù man declined. ‚ÄúI faith God save me.‚Äù

As man stood porch watching water rise steps, man canoe paddled called him, ‚ÄúHurry come canoe, waters rising quickly!‚Äù man said, ‚ÄúNo thanks, God save me.‚Äù

The floodwaters rose higher pouring water living room man retreat second floor. police motorboat came saw window. ‚ÄúWe come rescue you!‚Äù shouted. man refused, waving saying, ‚ÄúUse time save someone else! faith God save me!‚Äù

The flood waters rose higher higher man climb rooftop.

A helicopter spotted dropped rope ladder. rescue officer came ladder pleaded man, ""Grab hand pull up!"" man STILL refused, folding arms tightly body. ‚ÄúNo thank you! God save me!‚Äù

Shortly after, house broke floodwaters swept man away drowned.

Either way, yes unfortunately kids can't get vaccinated yet, that's reason need get eligible people vaccinated dampen spread.

I vaccinated. took responsibility. don‚Äôt know people can‚Äôt comprehend vaccines leagues beyond mask, presume it‚Äôs vaccines provide invisible protection mask visual humans like visual indicators, even reality less effective option. personally better handle perspective will-not manage pandemic better CDC's. 

The CDC laundry list guidelines society ignored years. mean, come on, tell eat raw fish. updated guidance vaccinated people don‚Äôt need wear mask, offered vaccines every one 12 wanted one infections low. Despite took couple months vaccinated mask again, time indefinitely since we‚Äôre longer waiting vaccine. 

There absolutely faction people never able mentally move want people mask forever. highly vaccinated state‚Äôs hospitalizations 1/5 peak plateauing, we‚Äôre asked remask considered okay take off? answer reach tangible metric, it‚Äôs cautious ‚Äúfeel‚Äù safer, regardless much situation objectively changed. 

Fortunately governor remarkably intelligent politician. knows situation still much safer earlier year, beyond unvaccinated getting infected right now, situation isn‚Äôt really going get better since people already received vaccines. hospitals well, aren‚Äôt facing collapse, hasn‚Äôt imposed state restrictions deplete one first democratic governors 2020. fair man is, created special executive order clarifying individual towns cities right impose mask mandates wish, listened public health advisors reasoned state doesn‚Äôt need sweeping mandate. appeal authority fallacy important you.

Well everything right refundable. got flights yet point return coming week think antivax teacher greater risk they've made choice kids haven't. trust choices managing exposure think they're likely infect people. they're probably spouting bullshit lies.

And put kids room smaller groups trainee teachers volunteer parents. That's absolutely better shitty anti-vaxxer. WTF..that's nuts. this?? Assuming vaccine mandate assuming percent vaxxed United States go significantly, covid case numbers ever decline significantly now? ""new reality"" look like seeing, still optimistic end hope reach? means mandate masks permanently. ‚ÄúGrandma got flu, didn‚Äôt wear mask?‚Äù point stop? get vaccine lessen chances getting it, lessen symptoms? Going public always carries risk. choose wear one. think parents concerned unvaccinated child chooses wear mask putting child underlying conditions risk child feel comfortable going school, hence discrimination issue. parents feel schools catering personal choice/freedom rather safety.  Determine case tracking capacity given administrative area. case counts get point, allowing consistent 1 effective r0 values, reopen properly inherently bad question, often question used denialists way claiming problem serious worth things like mask vaccine mandates. imagine downvoted people assuming asking reason genuine sense curiosity. Agreed , also even though it‚Äôs 52% that‚Äôs still 30%+ adults millions people get infected we‚Äôll get hospitalized. Completely agree this. made cry-laugh trying eradicate Covid completely?

No.

Thanks this. That's Modernas new branding vaccine? That's kinda funny.  $$$ can't speak security system way verify things, going guess screen lazier unvaccinated folks. yes, likely screen every person falsifies paperwork, system does? think decrease many patrons unvaccinated, would make successful intervention. Pfizer donor Georgia legislators oppressing voting rights agree something weird data. Looking past 30 days, cases slowly creeping deaths quintupled vaccinations excruciatingly slow progress. cases reported tested? 85%

Comparing alpha strain delta?

Previous study flawed?

Something else?   Kudos hardwork twiv broadcasts. Watched frequently first months covid-19 outbreak. antivaccine stance. attempt educate people focus actual point vaccines. protect first foremost.

That's still wear mask follow mandates like everybody else. scientific community known window eradicating covid closed long ago. must learn live disease dealing years come. Got it. Duh.

I guess response would I‚Äôm fortunate every person regularly interact got vaccine. feel siblings parents don‚Äôt want it.    *sigh* no....I live biology/virology ignorant area country... Nothing, hoping EU recommendation ban Americans would pressure Biden. guess not? failure eradicate virus mean death, illness social isolation continue scales seen far. future depend heavily type immunity people acquire infection vaccination virus evolves. Influenza four human coronaviruses cause common colds also endemic: combination annual vaccines acquired immunity means societies tolerate seasonal deaths illnesses bring without requiring lockdowns, masks social distancing.

The meat it. y'all need chill ""omg y'all really want lockdowns nothing watching tv ramen noodles forever?!"" rhetoric, fine, fine get vaccinated, get closer whatever normal eventually. imagine people previous pandemics could dream well now. Relax little.  Yeah, COVID make happen. Comirnaty sounds like Cartman saying community. that's brand recognition work. admit fell too. felt comfortable Pfizer ""trusted"" more. reality, simply heard name ""Pfizer"" repeated often ""moderna"" made completely random, irrational decision based fact heard name knew ""big company"" made ""many drugs heard of"". Either better marketing Moderna, prevalent US.

This marketing work. exploits natural [cognitive brain.

In case, could combination of:

1. Availability Heuristic
2. Mere exposure effect / Familiarity Principle Rip, Zune...  got moderna, fuck yes. Careful now, DeSantis literally send people home put guns kids faces mentioning this. point people reasoned way shake faith view. censorship accept parent done unto child reach emancipation/legal adulthood. censorship wrong detestable. ready die hill. wanted Moderna start!     work medical field? I‚Äôm asking since must exposed large quantities virus get infected twice, even vaccinated.   Check Canada, they've mixing vaccines may find something J&amp;J mixed one ones (e.g. 1 shot brand + 1 shot brand P) Would explain stronger reaction moderna moderna made (and friends got it) feel sick 2nd shot? everyone know got Pfizer didn‚Äôt feel much anything? entirely coincidental? freaking vaccine people.

In vein, first paragraph (specifically: ""less ingredients overall"" somehow safer) first sentence second refuted. secondary ingredients used proven safe, exist vaccines. Prior COVID, mRNA vaccines already proven safe, supporting technology (managing stability delivery) funding needed push.

Just FYI, got moderna.  That's th3 thing Pfizer. got 3x vaccine dose, get double antibodies.

Quarantine parenting HARD. hard, noped #2. evidence failed consider this, point basically 'Hey thought thing bet think thing plan bad!' MODERNA GANG! ‚úä   It‚Äôs really black white depends age health. seems among israel studies (mostly people 16-52) protection longer 6 months. 

We measure immunity lots ways noted lower antibody counts don‚Äôt necessarily mean likely get sick hospitalized. fact memory b cells might better predictor half life found 200 days, meaning you‚Äôd protection much longer 6 months possibly years depending quantity start post infection.

If you‚Äôre generally healthy you‚Äôre older get covid, you‚Äôre likely reinfection younger people without comorbidities. blanket statement might helpful.

Though Israel study find symptomatic reinfection 27x less common prior covid.   Pretty sure determined Pfizer also less strict storage requirements initially thought. got Moderna husband got Pfizer vaccine. much worse time second dose Moderna, even though immune insufficiencies. guess makes sense!  Convenient reasoning get booster, happens moderna instead Pfizer originally? got shot week later (5 weeks). figure could snort line virus mirror point. article watched briefing CDC director discussing them, couldn‚Äôt find that. 

Keep mind pre-print study, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs definitive, suggest Moderna holding better Pfizer. got second jab Moderna April antibodies 2 weeks ago 1,298.  Ok conducting study analyzing data? following strict set procedures doubt safety vaccines?

On top data something analyze right away. There's shit ton people working make sure everything looks good. fear dying Covid carrying long term health problems long haul organ damage huge. mRNA vaccines creating spikes via mRNA body completely gets rid synthetic mRNA would even matter type getting?

Unless...?? poll also says 69% adults vaccinated, CDC says 61% are. means categories overcounted. also breaks Trump Biden voters likely better job capturing independents vote one party want describe part party. 50 91 percent there. feel bad using weird weights measures rest world doesn't.

I believe compatriots share views this.

It's like different standards elsewhere. countries use comma decimal separator example proudly declare drive wrong side road Since April 1, 2021 (the date vaccines started readily available all), 100K Americans died COVID. 2K fully vaxxed. 2K, 90% 65 underlying conditions 20% COVID symptoms tested positive (they likely died something else). numbers astounding proof vaccines work. much I'd love believe this. There's things bugging article.

&amp;#x200B;

1. author provides real argument dispel Israeli data. act like there's tons evidence data suffers Simpson Paradox, states ""The first vaccine holders probably traveled more"". me, far likely time much bigger contributor amount break-through cases socio-economic conjecture.
2. seems like weird shot big pharma. Which, totally understand. definitely incentive pharmaceutical companies want booster shot. argument data, feels misplaced.

&amp;#x200B;

Not dismissing article, really saying anything conclusive adding noise. got two Moderna shots different arms, dual-channel 5G. Can't beat download speeds! even trying do? Ham-fist mRNA word community? grossly inaccurate? making claims based data statistical analysis. Also, really say Moderna far (more) superior, says antibody titers twice much (statistically significant). disprove even half Moderna's antibody titers, Pfizer still 90% effective reducing symptomatic infections.

That said, final premise correct: get whatever vaccine available. get boosters future anyway. wonder compare natural antibody numbers, tested got 2500 u/ml (moderna) laws tested (natural) ~200 ~600. study delta saying natural immunity might better, knows means! still breakthrough infection, delta JOKE Pfizer recipients get Moderna booster? I‚Äôm due soon.  funny hospital work one busiest birth schedule long time...also sadly people would bring child world wrong people, Ala, idiocracy suspect increasing amount children(all guessing) order drown rest us.   R0 Delta points need 90%+ population resistant spread stops. guess would slow first. think info yet. heard anything? get it? ped told based dates got it, son would gotten antibodies. makes feel ton safer (but 9 11yr old still waiting patiently jabs) OBs midwives across country still recommending vaccine pregnant women. original guidance recommendation, talk doctor make informed choice. wasn‚Äôt July ACOG changed guidance full recommendation, wasn‚Äôt August CDC same. 

Anecdotally, got pregnant January excited get vaccine right away Texas considered pregnancy high risk condition. OB told official advice per hospital lawyers be, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre worried, wait give birth get vaccine.‚Äù told ‚Äúoff record‚Äù absolutely recommended it. Uhh missing fact still prevents hospitalization death extremely high rate?? point actually? yet felt full effect last year's chaos econony still struggling control now. Something give one point. nobody data time showing would case.

Nobody hard data, true. Except fact vaccines increase efficacy longer waiting periods (when talking weeks vs months). wasn‚Äôt completely blind. actaully data saying this?

What's missing life? stated elsewhere, Israel data often misconstrued. debatable boosters even notable experts calling delaying second dose citing 3 4 week periods weren‚Äôt really based efficacy. Booster doses vaccines 6-12 months apart. would different? mean, McD's kiosks self-serve now, makes sense fast food. restaurants becoming thing kinda worries me. Putting aside arguments servers underpaid/over-tipped lot bars restaurants, people want consumer side? people hate server bartender interactions much? Legitimate question. would take wild guess also say birth control pills selling like PS5s! Probably good time doctor performing vasectomies also. It‚Äôs suggested time get vaccinated different vaccine. multiple people (Germany AstraZeneca Pfizer afterward) it‚Äôs still much unknown recommend. suggestion social distance, masking, waiting information.  parents Mormon got vaccinated right away. in-laws well. sister-in-law however, gone deep end refuses even though Mormon well. watched meeting yesterday. committee members seemed concerned treated shot callers whether boosters approved, rather whether boosters good idea. concerned power, wanting data. seemed like wanted make point. matter national importance, data shows waning immunity starting mid July, small group elitist academics pushing back power. Obviously consideration vaccines safe. let cynicism get way recognizing speed rollout efficacy may biggest medical miracle history species. ICU count seriously lagging indicator. Daily cases could drop weeks months load ICU ventilators continues rise. What's Belgium's dosage interval Pfizer?

I'd interested know antibody status Canada interval mostly 8-16 weeks Pfizer also mixing Pfizer Moderna some.  That‚Äôs counting tested. There's overlapping data points indeed read paper, written difference statistically significant (p-value &lt; .001). get one CVS. fib ask questions beyond fill online.  would interesting see Amazon numbers condom delivery  effect dramatic people vaccinated.

Not OP booster news, feels hard decipher what's true risk what's not. I'm also obese, young, got vaccine January, live Florida, i'm kinda panicking little protection thought course. vaccine talking booster. Dose 2 got pregnancy got high fever worth, study Switzerland study Germany failed find statistically significant differences Long COVID symptoms students who'd COVID. (UK) bit weird position think, started recommending ~3 months shots (I got ~10 weeks Moderna), advent Delta decided getting everyone double jabbed important waiting presumed optimal period jabs, allowed everyone reschedule second sooner. Lots people ended 1 half 2 month gaps think.

I'm sure there's fascinating data there, going take crunching. wait - CDC gave guidelines, angry at... federal government? school districts controlled local cities municipalities? 3rd shot cake walk compared 2nd. mild body aches slept lot 2nd shot kicked ass big time. shot Tuesday morning Thursday morning felt great. Even arm sore 1st 2nd shot. ""get vaccinated early regardless product""

""vaccines different efficacy""

These things true. Wanting early shots arms way implies vaccines eventually released equally good. cold almost two years.

In fact, young children might even higher personal risk vaccine side effects virus. countries Europe giving vaccine healthy people 16 (Germany example). countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland, believe Denmark stopped using AZ vaccine. do, generally much less severe.

This applies third dosage well. Two dosages Moderna/Pfizer works well, it‚Äôs difficult get solid data effective third shot is.  Well starters things would work‚Ä¶so maybe Florida try them? Honestly, say are‚Ä¶ think that‚Äôs way right now.  hope peak truly behind Florida. Well know quote damn lies statistics. example surprised find say vaccine say 70% 90% effective, really reporting average several numbers. amount vaccine effective infection, mild illness, serious illness/hospitalization, death, different numbers; also effective vaccine say 30, 60 90 days. average one number. people care effusiveness serious outcomes say 30 days. used say Pfizer 90% effective J&amp;J 70% effective, difference primarily mild illness, people care about, people also dig details, see 90% greater 70% assume J&amp;J vaccine 20% better, incorrect. Similarly, justification booster shots vaccine effectiveness ""wanes"" 6-7 months. wanes mild illness, remains serious illness. people taking third shots slightly reducing chance mild illness lot benefit.

But digress. point one vaccine provides 2/1000 benefit another provides 4/1000 benefit 2nd indeed reported ""twice good"", going 0.2% 0.4% benefit many people. mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs get socialized health care. Sure. local Taco Bell turns lights building drive dark. They‚Äôve done years.  IIRC 3% roughly percentage identified kinds issues. know that's expected change time goes fairly static?

It‚Äôs long term health issues. limits restrictions something. sitting McDonald's, ambiance? work large biotech. 90 percent vaxxed decided mandate it. remaining 10 percent still lost mind it... moved Bay Area upstate rural NY year teen...very much culture shock opposite way. I‚Äôve never gone school 100% white people before, actually made uncomfortable white person lol. companies care public health, reputations bottom lines. what‚Äôs protocol then? child quarantine 7, 10, 14 days? work? Uh... fucking think? Big brain plays brought macdombles Data wild vs data designed study different. They‚Äôll want controlled trial data make determination. Limited data short period time following third. 

Vs know efficacy severe disease hospitalization.  

We far information latter protection infection still high protection severe disease hospitalization death extremely high. 

Going third doses booster problematic risk vs payoff far smaller vs original 2 doses given unvaccinated people original doeses compared unvaccinated.  

The risk profile / weight far different here. Also Moderna pfizer release booster specifically delta block infections four shot within 12 months effect people? don‚Äôt value yourself, expect someone else value you?

I‚Äôm sure even worth‚Ä¶.somewhere.  think cases get worse people tend careful that's levels slowly declines. catastrophic thinking based reality. responsible thing do? Probably not. vaccinated college students get COVID end ventilators.  funny middle ground compromises seen 'theatre'. Okay well believe case advance nuclear option shut things down. can't either real. people clearly dying. Yeah covid. Like Jesus christ. newer In-N-Out locations massive drive throughs too. sucks.  indoor seating permanently banned fast food restaurants safety. 


And safety covid safety entitled trash like assault people already making shite pay. Jesus fuck. That‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm sorry. can't see difference getting regula vaccines hyper political situation around vax, reason continue conversation. 15 living wage places. live smaller town Florida 1bdr apartment averaging 1k per month would paying 50 percent take home rent. rural areas live 15. parents vaccinated likely going orphaned. saying ‚Äúagain,‚Äù one ever said ok start boosters. WH announced Sept. 20 start date get logistics geared up. approved FDA yet, reviewing data waiting come soon, recommendation CDC ACIP yet prioritize, etc. wonder everyone confused, Fauci announcing Sept. 20 start instead waiting FDA CDC processes. I‚Äôm usually big fan messaging really screwed up.  


Dose issue. Safety data needs reviewed data clinical effectiveness. Recs also made regarding vaccinating vaccine not, according work blueprint ACIP meeting today.  I've potentially well. ""something"" first week March 2020. loss smell/taste, dry cough lasted three days. SO's cough lasted almost two weeks. Got Pfizer 13 months later. Definitely Honestly even likes eating inside usually gross since people treat like trash 

And people paid minimum wage would incentive keep clean getting paid enough care

So go home eat eat car anywhere outdoors Looks like 65% people vaccinated (looking daily reports here: )

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, Delta, need something along lines 85% people 3 doses get herd immunity vaccines. approved age groups, pretty much infeasible anywhere get herd immunity vaccines. Much less 2 doses. Perhaps help US based schools better prepare. Reminds statues Prague.   suggesting never-ending restrictions? That's solution??? Ty illuminating analysis. Hmm wonder Why? vaccine 99.99% preventing severe breakthrough cases. weeks ago, 5.3 / 100k hospitalized overall. sad complaining clean fleshlight? See that‚Äôs wondering get breakthrough infection also get natural antibodies vaccine stop gets point? Sure... that's want tell yourself... people never considered want dictate hard deadline much want solid explanation hold time line is. trying force make decision actually ready.  Ask Israel Full video updates Delta paid faster shipping. Maybe peak, wait next week I'm vaccinated too. offering wanted back forth negotiations. worked best. Isn‚Äôt delta   Question: got Moderna initial vax series. get Moderna booster? matter Pfizer? curious. estimate roughly 4.5 million (95% CI: 2.8M 6.2M) excess deaths 16 months pandemic India. cannot demonstrate causality COVID excess deaths, pattern excess deaths consistent COVID-associated mortality.

Someone pls explain? Would've* rock!! hospitalizations peak probably come two weeks new cases peak. do.

Moderna Pfizer working combo (Moderna RSV vaccine too). seems like pretty colossally low possibility give up, guess get sushi terribly often (for people) huge concession. Interesting plenty children going waste adopted sponsored. Real world data personal anecdotes. Birthrate globally im sure anecdotes suddenly invalidate data. normal immune system generally dispatch pathogens (properly prepared) sushi.

Going book calculated gamble - there's reason think would've problem, tested. 

Keep mind combinations Pfizer etc would've loved test, people dying thousand time matters. Ideally we'd test different dose levels, different timings, etc, time. Expect things refined get data. 

Fact breakthrough infection typically disastrous, harm comes 21 day gap, better needing booster dying. Getting immune possible quickly possible step 1. Getting booster stage means step 1 went pretty well. spend fortune fertility doctors luck. end I'm thankful I'll never explain grandchild like watch butterfly went extinct except ones zoo. Anecdotal nurses hospital tended stronger reactions 2nd dose moderna Pfizer, majority sick calls Moderna fucking terrible name. cannot believe idiots landed ""Comirnaty"" ""SpikeVax.""

""Spikevax - COVID-19 protection...*for men.*

*cuts man swinging pickaxe*

*wipes brow*

""When comes reducing community transmission Sars-COV-2, need vaccine works hard do.""

*swings pickaxe* can‚Äôt believe eat cafeteria! Mine elementary school lunch delivered classroom eat there. someone lives Maricopa, pretty scary.  probably going several years travel restrictions end. Immunocompromised people still get vaccine still recommended get vaccine, might work them. 

Only contraindication severe allergic reaction component shot. people actually contraindicated, don‚Äôt know getting first dose. 

(This mRNA. would avoid adenoviral vector vaccines reproductive age woman due low risk blood clots - still better virus.) Well Pfizer apply emergency actual booster though. think don‚Äôt want rush third dose batch. 

Because actual booster comes wonder ok take. 

Under current emergency authorization allow third dose immune compromised individuals.

‚ÄúHowever, amended emergency use authorization, third dose authorized administration individuals least 12 years age Yeah, Florida Texas to. Abbot, DeSantis, Trump think know CDC put together. no-mask thing working great right now. 5 no-mask states teetering hospital systems collapse - keep coming. Bold strategy- leave individual choice!

My state, governor, myself, nothing like people. We‚Äôve advocated vaccine since they‚Äôve become available, unlike people. unlike people, aren‚Äôt anti mask problem others wearing mask. recognize state virus managed don‚Äôt need mandates vaccinated. banned school mask mandates like one governors has. trouble providing link CDC telling us eat raw fish. 

No problem all. avoid foodborne infection, eat raw undercooked fish, shellfish, food containing raw undercooked seafood, sashimi, sushi, ceviche.‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep eggs refrigerated 40¬∞F colder‚Äù (This one isn‚Äôt even followed outside US, countries know eggs safe eat without refrigeration long don‚Äôt wash outside egg‚Ä¶ US dairy farms forces us refrigerate safe)

‚Äú never taste raw dough batter.‚Äù mean, come on. There‚Äôs clearly disconnect CDC feels compelled suggest liability sake actually normal part life. real possibility there‚Äôs always going section CDCs website suggesting mask vaccinated people list locations people inevitably visit every day part life.

Memory cells remember fight virus, last indefinitely. Antibodies die memory cell remains. wife got Pfizer. time booster switch Moderna? Probably anytime soon. EU recommended member states reinstate travel restrictions Americans. Beats fucking Comirnaty lmao Initial research suggests Moderna vaccine maybe better Delta variant Pfizer vaccine. Link immune poison? took two doses I'm healthy af.

You're poison. blind following idiots praying fear would stupid try sow discord without real evidence. 

Stay leper colony. want variant breeding biology anywhere near go back world. taught Georgia decade ago, new hires rate unpaid sick leave first 6 months, hire pay sub yourself, losing billable hours twice. Hopefully, Alabama better that.

They also lied bonuses STEM teachers. Yeah baby January seems like lot people pregnant babies. company 4 people team alone maternity leave 2 paternity leave time Exactly. knows exactly what‚Äôs going he‚Äôs gone far stay lane. Changing anything would admit wrong abandon last living people think Covid big deal. developing countries like Philippines? Put unmasked kids portables window units. think difference would surgery performed. Hospital beds short supply operation done outside hospital really take resources away treating covid patients. I've simple surgeries orthodontist orthopedic offices. hospitals cancelling elective surgeries impact elective surgeries occurring elsewhere. could wrong though, impression hospitals decreasing number non covid/emergency admissions. peoples thoughts getting moderna booster vaccinated Pfizer? anecdote, mine not. Mine comes tracked data, personal experience. reason CDC data CDC stopped tracking breakthrough infections lead hospitalizations deaths months ago. made decision. current surge. delta. However, even data shows protection hospitalizations deaths dropping, especially among got vaccine earliest. Booster shots taking away vaccines rest world. Much world even infrastructure store vaccines. Even gave vaccines. associates? medical professionals 2 years higher education?? looking applications treatment cancer. might entirely new era, similar antibiotics discovered. personal doubts additional shot provide additional protection potential waning efficacy first two shots. 

However, I‚Äôm nowhere near qualified (same people here) say *when* someone get next shot. I‚Äôm assuming CDC better data expertise area do. 

In case, certainly unethical ‚Äúfib‚Äù medical records receive treatment think need. binary, sure. 

Fact is, even healthy person would interact immunocompromised people and/or children yet vaccinated. Even person living alone groceries delivered them, sick requiring h hospitalization miserable experience trouble breathing, 102+ fever, everything else COVID do. even go experience ""long COVID"" which, scientifically proven, seems enough anecdotes suggest body affected enough experience long term brain fog fatigue debilitate impede someone's employment much more.  choice Pfizer Moderna chose two doses Pfizer. World Health Organization interim report said vials contain multiple doses opened, vial disposed six hours. extra logistics step inspire lot confidence. Mistakes happen want risk given something work left open long. looking apparent sticking ""manufacturer recommended"" 21-day interval terrible idea.

Huh? took best guess based vitro animal models estimate pretty decent? 

Saying terrible idea crazy. Saying needs optimized true. needs shouted rooftops: vaccine reduces symptom severity, staying home, avoiding crowds indoors + masking prevents infection.

Public health messaging failure. I'm sorry happened you. long term symptoms noticed far? one three million. That‚Äôs still studied. Wish better answer you, nothing concrete yet. Depends located. Canada, mixing vaccines common, even recommended got AZ first dose. Prime Minister Trudeau Chancellor Merkel got AZ/mRNA combination doses. perfectly safe legal get moderna booster two pfizer shots. recommended countries well, CDC. people said masks helpful lol Well, kind of. mean example, another Christian reading old testament eating shellfish could say, written 3000 years ago, different language, truth could lost translation, copying over.

Or could say different time, back refrigerator, food standards, shellfish could bad.


The difference Mormonism belief based fact different Christianity living mouthpiece God.

So says ""get vaccine"" try say ""maybe misunderstanding... really mean that"", could come back say:. ""No, misunderstanding.  mean exactly that. Get vaccine, mister!"".

I'm sure that's exactly God talks,. that's different reading 3000 year old book. I'll eligible 3rd shot around November 20th. able choose vaccine get? got two Pfizer shots first time around back March take could get. Knowing know now, I'd rather 3rd shot Moderna. got mixed shot AstraZeneca Moderna. idea level antibodies is, small studies indicated particular cocktail produced good levels. hope get find out. China must pissed wonder people working inside got raise too. Imagine someone still getting paid like $9ü§£ two arguing different things. You‚Äôre arguing there‚Äôs anecdotal evidence that‚Äôs strong enough support 3rd booster shot isn‚Äôt dangerous, I‚Äôd probably agree that. 

He‚Äôs arguing isn‚Äôt scientific evidence support claim, I‚Äôd also agree that. standard scientific evidence evidence average person would use decisions hugely different. Israel‚Äôs data nowhere near scientifically rigorous, there‚Äôs control, there‚Äôs blinding, there‚Äôs real follow up, general numbers reported nationwide. 

This isn‚Äôt enough say, scientific certainty, third dose safe ‚Äî even enough say personal sake safe. Vaccines don‚Äôt work way.they don‚Äôt prevent virus infecting rather make body better equipped fight it. deaths vaccine widely available would partisan skewed. would need look recent deaths say June on. Yes stuff decades medical data back up, new vaccine that. Pretty much new medication ""don't take pregnant trying become pregnant"" warning. 

We're running medical trials pregnant women obvious ethical reasons really know can't based adverse OTC reactions emergency type situations. üëç thanks clarifying Lol sub really telling FDA rush process important scientific studies. Hey fair enough. would position fwiw, curious specific source relay. Appreciate discussion! grew rural Oregon family rural Washington working jb medical field. situation bad. Rural hospitals clinics already full, new admits get transferred bigger hospitals ie n main cities, also almost full. 

My sister works hospital Longview, WA says practically every new admit due covid. Except they're elderly time, they're mostly 30-49 age bracket. 

Oh, seems like panic shopping started again. üòÖ Yes. legal //////recommended////// CDC neither masks lol.

I requested moderna specifically two pfizer shots well would she‚Äôd done first offered treatment, unfortunately. still can‚Äôt hurt. Husband got Moderna, waited 6 weeks doses. we're waiting covid test results. symptoms started within 12 hours coughing fatigue different symptoms. mostly mild though started improving day 3. No. take responsibility self. made choice hang kayak trip mostly outdoors.however confined space bus took us launch. 

I put family risk. one else did. incredibly long 18 months isolation wanted get birthday. back fired.

That said‚Ä¶ consider catching virus matter if. part control vaccine kept wife safe (we shitty week, never serious condition all) 9 month old antibodies vaccine via wife‚Äôs breast milk. 

All said‚Ä¶ proves need people get vaccinated. friend gave Covid miserable. get vaccine soon able even sadder note, friend us‚Ä¶ 51 year old mom died 2 days ago Covid. exposures unrelated tho. shit getting real live cincinnati it‚Äôs impacting like never Canada, explicit recommendation highest level mix need be. Natural immunity includes B cells body produces infection. That‚Äôs infected greater immunity Delta. many unknowns‚Ä¶.

No, stay hydrated, oxygen level 99 great. Slight chest pain could anxiety. helpful making sense Israel data sensational headlines. 

Totally agree ‚Äúsinking earth.‚Äù year ago, definition vaccine success 50% effectiveness; we‚Äôre mad doesn‚Äôt stay 90% forever. reminds Louis CK bit ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs amazing nobody‚Äôs happy.‚Äù

Very clear vaccine works well keeping people hospitals graves. It‚Äôs probably closest thing us ever see true medical miracle. country? they‚Äôre still convinced vaccine doesn‚Äôt work.  guy behind 7-11. Seemed legit!

She son high risk. immunocompromised MS syndrome pulmonary complications. got second 6 months ago.

I'm getting third month. We're working medical field work directly covid+ patients sometimes. nerve racking frustrating times. guidance yet Pfizer series, booster Moderna? Definitely case ""it must working better hurts more."" Thank Doctor. Major downside mentioned Fact Sheet antibody ‚Äúcocktail (combo two antibody lines)‚Äù: possible REGEN-COV could interfere body's ability fight future infection SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, REGEN-COV may reduce body‚Äôs immune response vaccine SARS-CoV-2. Specific studies conducted address possible risks.

Possibly kind ‚Äúrobbing Peter pay Paul‚Äù  were, thinking Pfizer boujee shot really understand logic behind honest. Surely closing sub good source accurate information rather counterproductive?  that's comparing entire rural spread state highly populated congested individual county. we're going stewards scientific reason use statistics carefully accurately. Okay?

Maybe missed patient surgeries excluded, always read elective surgeries cancelled/delayed. Lol masks also recommended.

This study demonstrated significantly higher humoral immunogenicity SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), infected well uninfected participants, across age categories. higher mRNA content mRNA-1273 compared BNT162b2 longer interval priming boosting mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks BNT162b2) might explain difference.

I'm sure data looking at, think - always - lag reporting deaths caused COVID U.S. usually takes 2-3 weeks get deaths reported, think looking COVID death numbers (and perhaps case numbers well) within last 2-3 weeks tells us anything meaningful. People hoping hitting near-term peaks death count would almost completely avoidable basic &amp; fully available precautions make lot sense me. Totally understandable folks downvoting sentiment...  wife actually side effects either shot. got Moderna got Pfizer (4 weeks wait time each).

I kinda felt couple days, that's really was. Oh arm felt like somebody punched me.

Honestly, kinda freaked expecting worse. Almost like keep getting shots feel like death couple days. know took LOL.  basically impossible say sure, might better get people vaccinated first shot sooner, gone back started second shots got first shot vaccines became widely available.

So would've much larger population people 70-something percent protection much sooner.

I believe that's Canada countries ended doing. Uh, they're trying... MODERNA GANG What? think know talking about. Everyone novavax trial crossed received actual novavax vaccine. ""ruling candidates placebo shot"" talking about? mean, Catholicism Pope, also believed speak god. I‚Äôd say real difference Mormonism Christianity Christians believe triune god. Mormons not. problem taking medicine shot, there's recommendations avoid taking otc meds post shot, taking shot.

It's crazy much varies person. want throw in, others reading through, yes, people feel like shit day two 2nd dose! I've friends spiked fever night following shot find mid day day after. got wife (and others) got Moderna pretty much zero side effects! usually hear people easy go it, might feel bad, tons people mild side effects. guaranteed bad time!

Do vaccines even issue, there's multiple manufacturers? kind first time history even happened? curious myself. So, that‚Äôs good? Idk mobile desktop url change reddit removeddit it'll bring deleted comments, tbf comments get archived atleast method still show. J&amp;J seems becoming ‚Äúbetter nothing guess‚Äù vaccine time goes on.   question: need twice antibodies?

Obviously, antibodies better must like ""top"" anti bodies makes little difference.

If say, 100 antibodies 99% chances solving issue, 200 makes little difference.

My example simplistic purpose, honestly curious answer.

Not kind context may lead people believe one vaccine twice effective another one might case all. seems like bit risk vs reward.

Well article side effects tend benign

I'll risk benign side effects better SpikeVax. No, specifically told wanted moderna ""pretty sure"" Moderna original shot bring card.

I argued getting moderna worked too, even showing pfizer.

Some countries even encourage mixing, clearly best thing health read one countries Yay, Moderna crew represent! Hindsight 20/20. like someone double Pfizer vaxxed February safe get Moderna booster becomes available stick Pfizer get booster ""mix"" two brands? remember early covid vaccines, even people allergic ingredient told could still get it, take certain precautions.

The number serious cases deaths also increased expected, lesser rate numbers amongst unvaccinated. Israel seven hundred seriously ill patients currently among 40% double vaccinated. 

The Israeli ministry health published study last week showing 4 - 10 fold increase protection 12 days following third shot clear mind Booster necessary required worldwide. depends are. overloaded health system rearrange resources ways might expect:

* health system owns hospital bunch doctor's offices outpatient clinics, scale back services locations move staff hospital needed. 

* Outpatient surgery theaters temporarily converted ICU beds connections equipment. 

* overloaded ER may direct people providers. example, routing possible broken bones orthopedic clinic instead hospital ER (this actually happened family member last winter). 

* hospital truly capacity left, try limit procedures could send patients hospital. Maybe there's procedure that's normally outpatient, 15% chance requiring hospital admission afterwards. hospital shut procedures beds available. 

Things interconnected think. did. canada approved method approve it. far shown great immune response. CDC reporting breakthrough infections increasing though?

You can't assume experience universal, applies everyone, everywhere.

Of course things crazy, major emergency, people tight spot, squeezed time &amp; resources, makes sense things hands deck &amp; anyone help anyway helping whatever way can.

It‚Äôs common Spain adult children living house parents grandparents. disproportionate amount case spread occurs home, Spain cases Northern European country kind living arrangement less common. think UCI allowing now, FDA telling go get it, I‚Äôm getting it.

If got J&amp;J vaccine, might well lie saying never got vaccine since one funding trial mix J&amp;J vaccines mRNA US. J&amp;J‚Äôs CEO stepping J&amp;J already got money. Seriously, clue allow boosters J&amp;J recipients since ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt data‚Äù support boosters per FDA.

I agree balance risk doses, always obvious everyone 4 weeks (and especially Pfizer's 3 weeks) suboptimal triggering best immune response.

The study led headlines around world waning immunity ‚Äî idea vaccines lose effectiveness time. U.S., Israeli study accelerated debate vaccine booster shots played role Biden administration‚Äôs recent recommendation Americans receive booster shot eight months second dose.

But real story waning immunity complex initial headlines suggested. scientists believe Israeli data misleading U.S. policy booster shots gotten ahead facts. evidence waning immunity murky, scientists say, booster shots may big effect.

At first glance, Israeli data seems straightforward: People vaccinated winter likely contract virus summer people vaccinated spring.

Yet would truly proof waning immunity two groups ‚Äî winter spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî otherwise similar other. not, differences might real reason gap Covid rates.

As turns out, two groups different. first Israelis received vaccine tended affluent educated. coincidence, groups later among first exposed Delta variant, perhaps likely travel. higher infection rate may stemmed new risks taking, change vaccine protection.

This paradox may also explain U.S. data C.D.C. cited justify booster shots. Many Americans began resume indoor activities spring. getting Covid may reflect newfound Covid exposure (as well arrival Delta), rather waning immunity time.

‚ÄòWhere it?‚Äô
Sure enough, data supports notion vaccine immunity waning much.

The ratio positive Covid tests among older adults children, example, seem changing, Dowdy notes. waning immunity major problem, expect see faster rise Covid cases among older people (who among first receive shots). even Israeli analysis showed vaccines continued prevent serious Covid illness essentially rate before.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving need boosters, it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, sociologist Times columnist, written.

Part problem waning-immunity story line irresistible many people. vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna others ‚Äî incentive promote it, booster shots bring big profits. C.D.C. F.D.A., part, history extreme caution, even harms public health. media tend suffer bad-news bias. many Americans understandably frightened Covid pay attention alarming signs reassuring ones.

The bottom line
Here‚Äôs best attempt give objective summary evidence, free alarmism ‚Äî acknowledging uncertainty:

Immunity probably wane modestly within first year receiving shot. reason, booster shots make sense vulnerable people, many experts believe. Dr. C√©line Gounder Bellevue Hospital Center told colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses vaccine highly immunocompromised persons nursing home residents, general public.‚Äù

The current booster shots may little good people. vaccines continue provide excellent protection illness (as opposed merely positive Covid test). People eventually need boosters, may make sense wait one specifically designed combat variant. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know whether non-Delta booster would improve protection Delta,‚Äù Dr. Aaron Richterman University Pennsylvania told me.

A national policy frequent booster shots significant costs, financially otherwise. Among things, exaggerated discussion waning immunity contributes vaccine skepticism.

While Americans focusing booster shots, policies may much beat back Covid, including vaccine mandates U.S.; rapid push vaccinate world (and prevent variants taking root); accelerated F.D.A. study vaccines children.

As always, open changing minds get new evidence. Richterman puts it, ‚ÄúWe time gather appropriate evidence rushing boosters.‚Äù probably worked way values trials. procurement price same, go Moderna would suppose. would presume Pfizer competitive advantage producing mRNA.

The Pfizer vaccine 30mcg mRNA diluted 1.8 mL solution.

J&amp;J appeared less effective first mainly ran clinical trials later Pfizer Moderna, South African variant major impact infections. 

More recently, J&amp;J appeared provide similar resistance Delta variant mRNA vaccines, although there‚Äôs much data J&amp;J vaccine mRNA ones.

The lack studies/trials J&amp;J Delta bit frustrating given many studies done mRNA vaccines comparison, likely due novelty. Even though J&amp;J hasn‚Äôt around long still delta variant studies point. J&amp;J viable vaccine option world well requires refrigeration freezing like others, one shot, it‚Äôs easier distribute scale. 

Interestingly, J&amp;J booster shot appears effective producing antibodies early trial, may see booster recommendation coming around time gets FDA approval. so... since 390AD? suspect 50 years time, ways keep western US habitable humans. Technology advances changes time. Clean energy already growing western US set get ton (mostly wind solar). Technology always changes gets better. 

So believe it‚Äôs possibly 50 years time, western US still habitable maybe they‚Äôll likely find solutions handle drought wildfire issues then. too. Pretty disappointed. MUUUUCH better alternative though. wasn‚Äôt much voting voting another four years whatever fuck mean? 98% vaccinated. Zero hospitalizations. Yet still restrictions.

The important thing happens next months, new variants emerge, sea people antibodies profile, antibodies partial structure COVID (the vacine showing full virus imune system). I‚Äôve wondered last 5 years J&amp;J designed Africa

mRNA half life like 7 minutes mRNA vaccines basically degraded like 15-30 minutes. RNA (not sure m) carrier virus infect cell first go sequences production. probably longer, lower amount spike protein production. Yes good see deaths low.

August 2020 lot us still locked down. bad many US would revolt another lockdown help slow spread. CDC recommended vaccine pregnant people August 11. following sister gave birth yesterday wife pregnant. surprising vaccination rate low because, anecdotally, lot OBs would say give medical recommendation studies vaccines pregnancy available yet. Fortunately, sister wife vaccine, revisionist history consider particular vaccine recommended 20 days ago.

[New CDC Date: Safe Pregnant People (August get Doctor prescribe it, sue hospital administer it. That‚Äôs article (with misleading title).

A huge portion covid cases people never knew it, situations like 5 people household sick one tests positive already know situation etc. 

Throw top 40-50k new vaccinations day probably 50k+ new cases day building immunity top going hit wall point fairly soon. Wonder Ronnie boy saw pic guy floor monoclonal antibody site Jacksonville. Maybe hospitalizations people scared shitless go they‚Äôll never come back out. 

I would love believe we‚Äôve seen peak, I‚Äôve seen much stupidity get hopes up. COVID zero policy meant we‚Äôve lived completely free lockdowns COVID restrictions 15 last 18 months. 

In context countries Oceania SE Asia pretty much covid free (except Indonesia) highly contagious variant wreaking havoc region. Vietnam also living freely longer did. likely NZ get another leak soon end lockdown, like happened don‚Äôt hit zero next 6 weeks

If hit zero stay lockdown, that's official current policy government. 

And way - Auckland stays lockdown end September, looks likely, it'll 170ish days total, European cities.

It *is* likely least average Aucklander NZer living large city lockdown given point coming months, current policy lock one case, whereas West increasingly moving towards lockdowns I'd bet enforce unless situation *really* gets completely control. judge enforcing doctors orders. Article title misleading. someone tell that
‚ÄúMy uncle almost died heart attack hospital going say died covid‚Äù Oh! sample size mom determine everything then. 

Keep raging idiot. NHS says twice week  virus eventually mutate less dangerous eventually wall vaccinated people. Meanwhile Floridians going Red Lobster walking COVID continue spikes like kills tens thousands every year. Definitely long term consequences that. know gamble. logical decision light limited vaccines relatively strong protection single dose gave variants circulation time.

Exactly, considerations drove decision, untested hypothesis increasing interval would increase efficacy vaccines. Florida's governor told immigrants Delta secretly air-dropped make numbers go up. Turns Disney's fantasy world sunshine state. Lawsuits incoming! Doctor wrote prescription drug. Hospital said wouldn‚Äôt administer it. Patients wife sued make use it. 

Title misleading. good data walking back approval school starts late 2021. terrible idea?

Even if, doses, antibodies interval longer 21 days, second injection 21 days still provide protection sooner?   Booster shots couple billion people amount 2 3 month delay rollout countries.

Every new wave, usually arrived gap 4 5 months(also time takes antibody levels drop), add months delay.

I think pretty much nutshell. Unless aggressively quarantine yourself, going exposed enough eventually get it. vaccines job keeping ending hospital. Beyond that, really comes everybody's individual risk tolerance getting Covid vs going back world. Great news! Also, feel bad using weird weights measures rest world doesn't. Many countries recognize it, day day. example, France explicitly says mRNA mix fully vaccinated, know EU countries accept it. 

There much uncertainty things explicit. country come say ok, media outlets portray allowed, true.

And mixing doses, people trouble travelling one two AZ vaccine authorized EMA example. Moderna gang rise up!  erior see paragraph claiming better performance vs breakthrough cases related antibody levels, Outside researchers said premature conclude difference antibody levels medically important.¬† That's super interesting.

Well article say that, there's reason ""not trust it."" Yup. I've change opinion times last month I've gotten information data come out. 

Timelines made based data strains prevalent studied time trends things like vaccination. new variant (Delta) takes vaccination demand plummets, timelines get set back. 

Its kind like weather forecasts. Reality chaotic, forecasts constantly updated predict hurricane going go early predictions multiple states off. weather forecasts still better warning all. Likewise, viral behavior human behavior predicted limited information timelines. Yeah check taco bell sub contact info. solution bad timing third shot. exactly ""catastrophic"". almost year since caught COVID, since immune system low easily get sick.
Does COVID affect immune system long term? going vaccinate kids know risks.

I actually don't. I've heard myocarditis thing kids getting vaccine, foggiest stats are.

This exactly FDA, throw pile data say ""Well, make decision yourself."" judge let idiots want. Fine, next part story medical board takes away ""doctor's"" license quack. guess economy important human 

it's though, economy requires human participation. restaurant hotel traffic robust summer due delta variant They‚Äôre free UK. decisions mandates, imagine You‚Äôre right vaxcels never admit it. Notice none variants spreading us rn US. poor countries gonna able vaccinate everyone long time, maybe never. keep trying blame people here. Prevent hospitals healthcare systems completely overwhelmed, vaccinate people (with first shots boosters needed) becomes endemic.

I'm 100% sure think pick one like $50. reason McDonalds Burger King don‚Äôt!  bit unknown since country long interval, data available. would also depend vaccine. Anything say would purely speculation since large enough sample size know happened. overall still protected, much safe say. 3 week interval speed testing.

The extension purely due vaccine shortage. countries chose ""first shots first"", others chose ""fully vaccinate first"" strategy. countries chose ""first shots first"" strategy might accidentally stumbled better dosing interval tested.

Hopefully third shot fix problems caused short dosing interval lead durable immunity. 21 day interval choice. done give us fastest possible turnaround time rollout. longer doses, trials would taken longer. Speed rollout given priority correct so. think actually semi-dangerous way look Covid point. 
Death rates scary easy point numbers, long term damage Covid creates persons body far damaging long wrong communities across country. 
Then add compounding lasting damage strains (including asymptomatic damage vaccinated people).

Why pander lowest common denominator? 

We descended Idiocracy. Another possibility: less total beds available week week drags medical staff contract virus others quitting retiring much higher rates (due unsafe staffing ratios and/or abuse). Even without profit motive, good reason get vaccines soon possible.

I originally stated handled pandemic worse plague handled. stand many deaths occurred preventable, acted properly start virus would spread mutated way has. 

The arguments given plague deadly Covid. people 1300's knew nothing germ theory etc etc.

That's fine agree opinion offered nothing back claims wrong. 


If think plague handled worse, specifically humans contributed many deaths? really issue comparing one day next, right?

The SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines BNT162b2 mRNA-1273 shown 90% efficacy preventing COVID-19 illness1,2 but, knowledge, humoral immune responses compared directly.

Methods

Health care workers tertiary care center scheduled vaccination 2 doses either mRNA-1273 BNT162b2 invited participate prospective cohort. Serologic testing performed prior vaccination well 6 10 weeks second dose . Total immunoglobulin levels receptor-binding domain SARS-CoV-2 spike protein measured anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 enzyme immunoassay . vaccination, antibodies SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein determined. Previous infection defined anti-nucleocapsid positivity point, anti-spike positivity vaccination, and/or history positive polymerase chain reaction results nasopharyngeal swab.

Antibody levels compared second dose vaccine entire cohort; previously infected vs uninfected; age group among previously uninfected individuals, using test log10 transformation. Correlation age log10-transformed antibody levels assessed Pearson correlation. adjust confounding, multiple linear regression fitted inclusion age, sex, previous infection, time vaccination serologic testing. tests 2-sided statistical significance set Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ.05. Analyses performed using RStudio . study approved local institutional review board; participants provided written informed consent.
Results

Of 2499 health care workers received 2 doses SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, 1647 participated study. total 688 vaccinated mRNA-1273 , 959 BNT162b2 .

Higher antibody titers observed participants vaccinated 2 doses mRNA-1273 compared vaccinated BNT162b2 .

Previously infected participants higher antibody titers compared previously uninfected participants . groups, vaccinated mRNA-1273 higher antibody titers compared vaccinated BNT162b2 . difference antibody levels according previous infection higher difference 2 mRNA vaccines .

Antibody levels negatively correlated age previously uninfected participants , highest among younger 35 years. Across age categories, previously uninfected participants vaccinated mRNA-1273 higher antibody titers compared vaccinated BNT162b2 .

The type mRNA vaccine remained independently associated log-transformed antibody titer multiple linear regression .
Discussion

This study demonstrated significantly higher humoral immunogenicity SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine compared BNT162b2 vaccine , infected well uninfected participants, across age categories. higher mRNA content mRNA-1273 compared BNT162b2 longer interval priming boosting mRNA-12733 might explain difference.

A relationship neutralization level SARS-CoV-2 vaccination protection COVID-19 demonstrated several studies.4 such, height humoral response vaccination, correlates neutralizing antibody titers,5 might clinically relevant.

Limitations study include lack data cellular immunity neutralizing antibodies, well specific focus health care workers. Whether observed difference antibody level translates difference duration protection,4 protection variants concern, risk transmission6 needs investigation. Future research also address relevance patients reduced antibody response vaccination.  It‚Äôs funny thing - work senior center held several clinics Moderna vaccines.

This made spit tea. Bravo. Twice pride, double fall. hate pandemic turned into. Every time hear unvaccinated person getting severely sick dying Covid, can't muster feeling sorry them. love children life itself, I've spent spans plague time authoritarian takeover thinking irresponsible reproduce. kids deserve better this. tracking data since beginning (you find posts /r/coronavirusaz sub).

Since AZDHS break demographics 12, go ages 0-19... right roughly 1 200 people age 20 confirmed cases would considered active infection (within 10 days initial exposure). 33% daily reported cases 0-19 demographic make 40% daily tests. 

The kids getting hammered right governor issued mask mandate ban schools goes effect 9/29. also tried blackmail schools remaining open dangling federal funding dollars front (I think got squashed WH tho). TITANIUM Late last month, researchers Israel released alarming new Covid-19 data. data showed many Israelis among first receive vaccine nonetheless catching Covid virus. Israelis vaccinated later getting infected often.The study led headlines around world waning immunity ‚Äî idea vaccines lose effectiveness time. U.S., Israeli study accelerated debate vaccine booster shots played role Biden administration‚Äôs recent recommendation Americans receive booster shot eight months second dose.But real story waning immunity complex initial headlines suggested. scientists believe Israeli data misleading U.S. policy booster shots gotten ahead facts. evidence waning immunity murky, scientists say, booster shots may big effect.After returning August break last week, spent time reaching scientists ask help understanding current, confusing stage pandemic. worried vaccinated people Delta variant? much risk children face? parts Covid story overhyped, deserve attention?

I trying answer questions coming weeks. (I‚Äôd also like know questions want answered; submit here.)One main messages I‚Äôm hearing experts conventional wisdom waning immunity problematic. Yes, immunity Covid vaccines wane point. may yet waned meaningful way.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs big difference needing another shot every six months versus every five years,‚Äù Dr. David Dowdy, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins University, told me. ‚ÄúSo far, looking data have, I‚Äôm seeing much evidence we‚Äôve reached point yet.‚ÄùAt first glance, Israeli data seems straightforward: People vaccinated winter likely contract virus summer people vaccinated spring.Yet would truly proof waning immunity two groups ‚Äî winter spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî otherwise similar other. not, differences might real reason gap Covid rates.

As turns out, two groups different. first Israelis received vaccine tended affluent educated. coincidence, groups later among first exposed Delta variant, perhaps likely travel. higher infection rate may stemmed new risks taking, change vaccine protection.Statisticians name possibility ‚Äî topline statistics point false conclusion disappears examine subgroups. It‚Äôs called Simpson‚Äôs Paradox.This paradox may also explain U.S. data C.D.C. cited justify booster shots. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many Americans began resume indoor activities spring. getting Covid may reflect newfound Covid exposure (as well arrival Delta), rather waning immunity time.‚ÄòWhere it?‚ÄôSure enough, data supports notion vaccine immunity waning much.The ratio positive Covid tests among older adults children, example, seem changing, Dowdy notes. waning immunity major problem, expect see faster rise Covid cases among older people (who among first receive shots). even Israeli analysis showed vaccines continued prevent serious Covid illness essentially rate before.‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving need boosters, it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, sociologist Times columnist, written.Part problem waning-immunity story line irresistible many people. vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna others ‚Äî incentive promote it, booster shots bring big profits. C.D.C. F.D.A., part, history extreme caution, even harms public health. media tend suffer bad-news bias. many Americans understandably frightened Covid pay attention alarming signs reassuring ones. 


The bottom line:

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs best attempt give objective summary evidence, free alarmism ‚Äî acknowledging uncertainty:Immunity probably wane modestly within first year receiving shot. reason, booster shots make sense vulnerable people, many experts believe. Dr. C√©line Gounder Bellevue Hospital Center told colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses vaccine highly immunocompromised persons nursing home residents, general public.‚Äù feeling states masks vaccines stubborn enough reject federal money come conditions. vaccine wars coming. mean, one hand, spreading doses may produced antibodies, wane, sure much beneficial they'd be. Especially delta. one dose like 30% effective delta? spreading probably would see hospitalizations deaths keeping 3 4 week windows. Jensenners ugly ducklings :( .   OK, good point - know this.

If vaccines spread worldwide fast enough odds totally Vaccine resistant virulent strain grow day. look strains coming almost entirely lower income countries limited health infrastructure. Personally fully vaccinated healthy 30yr G7 country taking booster becomes requirement something want international travel. People older chronic conditions like diabetes, obesity heart disease obviously consider it. yet there's reason reboot vaccine nationalism finally starting get doses lower income parts world. morbid, dead seniors great Social Security Trust Fund. go booster, ask Moderna. Boom, it. 

Just keep mind data established US (yet) cross-vaccinations (though countries don‚Äôt concerns.) find city specific data? could find country whole 45% one dose 26% fully vaccinated number  we're moving new phase based around personal responsibility, rather explicit regulation

good effing luck that! Obviously spikevax, even contest. Can‚Äôt even spell much less say one. harm getting Moderna. said, probably side-effects first *and* second dose, given antibodies already. relatively mild (headache, soreness, etc).

He's hiding deaths. *lil jon voice* ANTIBODIES!! body literature? science? kidding? *child free preferred term. feel like missing anything kids able lot parents can't do. rapid PCR? I'm Gay! Agreed. Especially since boosters always possibility anyway. made sense public health company financial standpoints.

Get drug public ASAP, figure longer intervals boosters appropriate later. really sad spun way many. billions people around world want US standard living.

I get you‚Äôre saying think really bad argument. always strive better *we* before. 

I think Americans would agree US rapid state decline. someone Bangladesh thinks US irrelevant Americans seeing basic needs go unmet. weird considering went way make sure got Moderna based early data. 

The lack Moderna data breakthroughs wondering trust early data suggested best would hold up.  article confirms correct seems. That's shame. understand, one reasons breast milk good antibody milk help protect baby, would keep child safe. Easy mistake. Compassion fatigue real. hear you, sorry jerks stupidity many, grief feeling builds option get little numb it. sorry hard pandemic healthcare workers. see angry upset unvaccinated.I wish well. didn‚Äôt GME AMC like Mormon church? Harboring victims Ida, yes. Not.. Really available. popup sites shut now, I've hazard guess shots spoiled due state losing power.

That's definite, educated guess. I'd actually look see get boosters. know full well one has, I'm sure them.

They're mostly 50+, 70+. Yes still protection, misgivings 88% chance ""being protected getting infected"" statement (assuming got 88%). fair, think way said technically wrong, open misinterpreted.

I understand I'm splitting hairs here, appropriate say 88% lower chance infected (which 12% chance infection). efficacy rates reduction outcome/infection vaccinated group compared unvaccinated group ([Efficacy outcome = (unvaccinated outcome rate - vaccinated outcome rate) / vaccinated outcome possible actual chance getting infected lower higher determinations would require separate trials determined appropriate infer based efficacy treats; instance exact situation replicatedwith populations vaccinated unvaccinated partners, possible percentage unvaccinated would contacted virus (in case would expected 88% fewer vaccinated people would get infected/more 88% would avoided virus); conversely every unvaccinated person got infected could 12% vaccinated group also got infected. Basically statistics make complicated recognizing science important, understanding representing appropriately also important. 

As wrap up, I'm satisfied explanation either mostly annoyed feel necessary (at understand enough use data disputes whilst simultaneously claiming meaningless, hospital consistenly 70 ICU patients unvaxxed 1 vaxxinated (on average) deaths running 5-10 per day unvaxxed occasionally even one vaccinated big fan Warren lol.

This states wanted: kids back schools adults back work. Gotta make green line go up. Ah, thank you! Triple dosed Moderna here! source heavily biased towards anti-vax cited study nothing COVID,

But really, knew tough want delay indefinitely. people know various income levels continued children (ages low-mid 30s) felt less odd thing do. vaccines, covid known contagious pre-symptomatic phase (as well asymptomatic). also know vaxxed unvaxxed people carry amount virus swabbed start infection (thereafter viral load goes faster vaxxed, course days). Although generalizable model, Provincetown outbreak presumably fueled, large part, asymptomatic spread vaxxed people, visibly sick probably going mood party (and hopefully would self-isolate decent human). So, considering things studies data on, would seem like vaxxed+asymptomatic spread possible, plausible significant player infection transmission, albeit smaller unvaxxed vaxxed+symptomatic. reasoning CDC used reinstate MaskForAllTM.

The good news least 350 people mostly ""had sniffles"" less -- yet see encouraging news vaccine reduces symptoms outside single study Singapore. article states, expected higher mRNA dose Moderna.

But vaccines seem give good-enough immunity begining, anitbodies directly created due vaccine.

Early Pfizer shot seemed better two mRNA shots. point, based every new article comes out, whenever got booster, I‚Äôll seeking Moderna one. Unless something drastically changes course. Yes no, Pfizer responsible Epirubicin Thalidomide, lead millions birth defects deaths worldwide. Yeesh. first shot pfizer. wait 2 1/2 months next dose, next Moderna due shipping delays.

So bigger delay tested mixed shots. Maybe better got ""stronger"" dose second? Like know works, concept sounds like took good route 95% private schools rare edge cases -- usually reserved extreme religious folks. But, like said, argument semantics point.

Another plausible explanation Simpson's paradox. statistical phenomena skew interpretation correlations data properly accounted for. case covid, see highest rate vaccination high risk demographics. 

High risk vaccinated individuals, less likely hospitalized high risk unvaccinated individuals. high risk vaccinated individuals also likely hospitalized low risk vaccinated individuals. highest risk vaccinated individuals may likely hospitalized lowest risk unvaccinated individuals.

Like million good enough, Pfizer produces 10 million, matter Moderna produces 20 million? Seriously asking. ‚ÄúOne main messages I‚Äôm hearing experts conventional wisdom waning immunity problematic. Yes, immunity Covid vaccines wane point. may yet waned meaningful way.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs big difference needing another shot every six months versus every five years,‚Äù Dr. David Dowdy, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins University, told me. ‚ÄúSo far, looking data have, I‚Äôm seeing much evidence we‚Äôve reached point yet.‚Äù

Simpson strikes again

At first glance, Israeli data seems straightforward: People vaccinated winter likely contract virus summer people vaccinated spring.

Yet would truly proof waning immunity two groups ‚Äî winter spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî otherwise similar other. not, differences might real reason gap Covid rates.

As turns out, two groups different. first Israelis received vaccine tended affluent educated. coincidence, groups later among first exposed Delta variant, perhaps likely travel. higher infection rate may stemmed new risks taking, change vaccine protection.

Statisticians name possibility ‚Äî topline statistics point false conclusion disappears examine subgroups. It‚Äôs called Simpson‚Äôs Paradox.

This paradox may also explain U.S. data C.D.C. cited justify booster shots. Many Americans began resume indoor activities spring. getting Covid may reflect newfound Covid exposure (as well arrival Delta), rather waning immunity time.

‚ÄòWhere it?‚Äô

Sure enough, data supports notion vaccine immunity waning much.

The ratio positive Covid tests among older adults children, example, seem changing, Dowdy notes. waning immunity major problem, expect see faster rise Covid cases among older people (who among first receive shots). even Israeli analysis showed vaccines continued prevent serious Covid illness essentially rate before.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving need boosters, it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, sociologist Times columnist, written.

Part problem waning-immunity story line irresistible many people. vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna others ‚Äî incentive promote it, booster shots bring big profits. C.D.C. F.D.A., part, history extreme caution, even harms public health. media tend suffer bad-news bias. many Americans understandably frightened Covid pay attention alarming signs reassuring ones.

The bottom line

Here‚Äôs best attempt give objective summary evidence, free alarmism ‚Äî acknowledging uncertainty:

Immunity probably wane modestly within first year receiving shot. reason, booster shots make sense vulnerable people, many experts believe. Dr. C√©line Gounder Bellevue Hospital Center told colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses vaccine highly immunocompromised persons nursing home residents, general public.‚Äù

The current booster shots may little good people. vaccines continue provide excellent protection illness (as opposed merely positive Covid test). People eventually need boosters, may make sense wait one specifically designed combat variant. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know whether non-Delta booster would improve protection Delta,‚Äù Dr. Aaron Richterman University Pennsylvania told me.

A national policy frequent booster shots significant costs, financially otherwise. Among things, exaggerated discussion waning immunity contributes vaccine skepticism.

While Americans focusing booster shots, policies may much beat back Covid, including vaccine mandates U.S.; rapid push vaccinate world (and prevent variants taking root); accelerated F.D.A. study vaccines children.

As always, open changing minds get new evidence. Richterman puts it, ‚ÄúWe time gather appropriate evidence rushing boosters.‚Äù source. Another source read efficacy vs delta at

Yep. kid three months pandemic confirmed one done. love kid dont want anymore. got 30/100 took long time see vaccine mentioned. I‚Äôm guessing aren‚Äôt vaccinated.

Sorry, know super excited give us time perfect routine. got moderna shots back april, got covid last week.  Gang gang ü§ù legislative leaders responded telling Wolf school mask requirements remain local decision.

I think forgot tell Florida. Please, COVID, let wish come true. Professor Racaniello. Columbia University (and New York colleges) pushing person classes mask mandate distancing, deadline proving vaccination. means masks required weeks.

Will classroom vaccination NPI safe student lives vulnerable people children and/or infant newborn? student wears N95 masks one else masking small classroom? 

The concern getting infected class bringing virus home. pulmonologist treating vulnerable adult pediatrician treating infant advised unmasked classroom unsafe even vaccination. (Note Columbia allow unvaccinated students exemption remain unmasked well,does change advice?)

I appreciate answer causing great stress among friends colleagues trying decide semester. number people took made go showed increase compared trials, data changed reflect that. reason number breakthrough cases goes people get vaccinated.  ngl, **data death** sound pretty metal ... People still getting faked weekend numbers? Nahhhhhhh. OP trying inject hopium conversation. Unfortunately OP, everyone else believes FL sowed time reap. north likely fine got vaccinated high rate, shitload people natural immunity virus ripped us 2020. 

Also, vaccine requirements gyms, restaurants, Broadway shows, etc. Might better gotten Moderna 2nd anyway, saw article front page sub saying Moderna creates twice many antibodies Pfizer. fully vaccinated bug all.  doctor prescribe antibiotics flu/cold will, weird. never picked up.

But anyway, think years research experience shown doctors unnecessary antibiotics they're prescribing essentially harmless individual level, ethically prescribe them.

Presumably we're trying get research experience right actually handing boosters general population. That's reason makes sense delay. Making unsubstantiated comments Reddit risks removed ;)  Idiots exactly scarce resource yeah. 3G rule Germany named way 3 criteria let someone in: vaccinated (German: geimpft), recently tested (getestet) recently recovered per doctor's note (genesen) . latter criteria missing Hawai'i 1. People catch spread variants;
2. estimates - even assuming could catch COVID - would take several years (4-5+) COVID run thru entire population.

The fact going ""run people infect"" newer variants continue infect sick - even antibodies - previous infected people who, time, lost immunity together.  Nope. informed said ""Oh thank God."" told could tested sif wanted to. claiming superior all. There's ups downs dosage levels.

However, though Moderna smaller company, specializing mRNA research decade now, meaning they've actually put research particular type vaccine, impossible believe may actually known keeping dosage higher. also trialed vaccine phase 1 2 different dosage levels picking one. lower dosage looked effective initially, still chose next level up. way Florida presents covid data unreliable.

I feel like said enough. see *inadvertently* broke fuck outta tracking pretty  10 days ago, went Walgreens said doctor recommended get third Covid vaccine. handed paper describing eligible. check box saying met criteria, sign it. Looked numbers, % testing positive average daily per 100,000 people nowhere close outbreaks US. think way serious it, almost weren‚Äôt part US. **#ModSquad 4 life!** theory verdict takes long get CDC's bureaucracy. time makes top, old news anyone paying attention.   Moderna also higher levels reported adverse effects, seems like bit risk vs reward. mixture both, definitely right initial delay. UK even shortened 12 week interval shots became readily available. 

[Covid vaccine: Eight-week gap seen sweet spot Pfizer jab  life. seems happy path, argue even disagree? won‚Äôt companies work together?  US didn‚Äôt get timing ‚Äúcatastrophically wrong‚Äù. Even timing isn‚Äôt optimal, vaccines good job keeping people healthy. It‚Äôs no-vaccine no-mask group filling hospitals. Agreed. like drug treatment touts ""early treatment saves lives,"" vaccines could described ""*prevention* saves lives""? They'd rather lie floor public library, sick dog, get treated something could prevented? vials filled extra solution account spillage amount left syringe. 

As long following dosage instructions, harm besides squeezing extra dosage excess solution time limited supply. injecting people extra vaccine case - always exactly amount that's required. want random person making decision inject less vaccine required. would rather careful. would nightmare vaccine harm good children.

The American Academy Pediatrics, group pediatricians, urged FDA approve 'limited' data due urgency.

I parent, professional organization pediatricians say seen enough authorize emergency use children, ""we need go right now,"" want done. kids, whole shitload kids clearly benefit time side. Moderna vaccines early February March. received third Moderna vaccine 10 days ago due taking immunosuppressant medications. Side effects little rougher first 2 vaccines. body aches, fatigue, headache low grade nausea days 3. 1st vaccine minor, second vaccine bit worse, last one actually felt bad enough take easy go bed early couple days. Also vaccine 2&amp;3 caused hard itchy/tender lump skin injection site lingered while. 2 weeks vaccine 2, still 10 days vaccine 3. itchy tender vaccine 2, tender itchy time. So, all, side effects unpleasant severe. Less flu shot last November. Yeah Italy first time world saw way countries apart China know believe back then. Paywalled? Makes think tourists much problem spreading it.  basically Delta. technically Delta+, would likely get AY designation (think like 26?) spread enough managed star super spreader event.

At point unlikely single mutated Delta variant going next big thing. article notes mutation concerning similar N501Y. N501Y already found many times Delta sequences though, interesting. 

Turkey even 30 sequenced Delta contained N501Y E484K, seem anything. 

I think though, journalists figure use GISAID, come new variant every day worry about! Delta pretty genetically diverse point. Could plan ahead could they?  pregnant doctor told take sarscov2 vaccine first trimester didn‚Äôt data whether safe afterwards nothing indicating unsafe. people got advice figure makes sense me. ended taking first trimester ways nervous Pfizer gang rise Maybe locations required travel them, places would adopt...  Moderate usually pretty bad. calling moderate? stop coercing young healthy people expirimental [sic] vaccine. 

Thank astute analysis, professor. Delta, big thing fast replicates. TCell immunity eventually kick in, presence antibodies ready respond virus important staving infection. initial antibodies wane, takes hold fast body respond super quickly.

If Moderna creating antibodies sticking around longer, theory that's ideal Delta reduce breakthroughs. Additional anecdote -

My toddlers brought covid home daycare. breakthrough case (Pfizer) wife (Moderna). 

I basically felt like mild cold week half. You? ""really high fever lot cases"" ?!?

You spreading disinfo right here.

You part problem. pretty crazy many news stories ""experts"" reported increasing 1st doses without addressing issue all. 2 doses considered fully vaxed opinion. Anything less 3 doses prevent infection transmission enough. Even one month two doses, Delta infectious WT 0 doses (the vaccine reduces risk infection 1/3rd Delta 3 times infectious) 1 doses joke controlling spread now, especially 3 months . considered vaccinated terms preventing spread. 1-2 doses still help hospitalization death, could get 100% 2 doses, would least prevent current hospital surge. good chunk population unvaccinated immunocompromised people people high-risk, there's plenty easy targets hospitalized.

It's like mixing opiates benzos anything.  gorilla comparison sucks throw money problem. bets worked, didn't. like direct hand developing vaccines. ~12 studies ongoing Canada. far looking like AZ-PF better either two doses. Makes sense antigen getting presented two ways, make antibody clonal population broader, could effective variants. Coupled 8+ weeks dosing Canada CDNs could different response profile US UK Israel.

I seen eye-to-eye family members fully Moderna vaxxed far lack precautions take public. I'm still really careful, wearing n95 masks anytime I'm indoors public, feel fairly protected circumstances feel worried spreading asymptomatic case, worry sometimes surprised house gotten sick yet.

Finally, US scientists keep saying follow data. even TRACKING BREAKTHROUGH COVID CASES unless hospitalized. even data reported properly. actual Mild Illness: Individuals various signs symptoms COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss taste smell) shortness breath, dyspnea, abnormal chest Moderate Illness: Individuals show evidence lower respiratory disease clinical assessment imaging oxygen saturation (SpO2) ‚â•94% room air sea level. article said got first dose.

One set data make pattern tho.  don‚Äôt luxury moving patients border another state things get really bad.  digital card available myColorado app (also stores digital ID/driver's license). sure enforced here. clear, obvious relatively painless ways make dramatically better quickly, enough people refuse it? Correct...  previous US administration, whatever reason, cover particular issue border closed never gets addressed US extends existing closure. someone northern border community, like everyone else northern border communities, loophole pretty silly. taxis tied Canadians fly driven border, particularly Canada relaxed rules quarantine citizens coming home.

For arcane policy (legal?) reasons, US moving forward opening north border leaving south border operating different rules without bit headache. underlying issue neighbors similar 'good place' regards Covid, neither border opening. Permademic!!  Note looked developed countries. Birth rates poorer countries largely unaffected covid. problem there's single number. amount antibodies required prevent infection proportional initial viral load. inhale viruses, lower antibody titer still protect you, whereas inhale enormous number viruses, need really high antibody titer resist infection.

This likely main reason Delta's infectiousness -- people carry much higher viral load, therefore coughs sneezes carry many viruses. also even imperfect masking (single-layer cloth masks, poorly fitted N95s, etc.) still helps -- sure, may still get exposed, probably exposed lower viral load would without mask, thus capable resisting infection least getting milder case.

So there's quantity antibodies prevents infection, ""more better"" general trend. even antibody titers tell whole story -- vaccinated person whose antibodies declined low still less likely get severe disease due immune mechanisms. end day vaccines act same. Get right foreign material body (mRNA gets body produce it) immune system react it. Everybody shooting blind this

My brothers.

I see eyes fear would take heart me.

A day may come vaccines fail, forsake friends break bonds fellowship, day.

An hour Karens screaming unmasked mutate Age Vaccinated comes crashing down, day!

This day fight!

By hold dear good earth, bid stand, Vaccinated Internet! anybody cares reading studies find them, gotta google indeed studies done, results part Com-COV trial, Oxford researchers administered various vaccine combinations 830 volunteers age 50. results showed highest number antibodies developed people received two BioNTech jabs, followed gotten shot AstraZeneca first BioNTech second. reverse order still yielded antibodies average two shots AstraZeneca. 

German Researchers Saarland University western Germany found people whose first shot AstraZeneca whose second shot BioNTech-Pfizer showed immune response stronger patients received two doses vaccine, AstraZeneca BioNTech. Must regionally dependent labor delivery nurse Georgia busting seams. child 2017 love life feel guilt every single day brought hell. feels horrible say likely would knew would happen next years, would spared her. know one could predicted global pandemic would occur 3 years later (at least absolutely idea coronavirus even was.) also admittedly ignorant educate climate change - knew threat view something affected life time. mom continues pressure children want laugh face - boomer experience hardship raising three children. even dream bringing another life world. Could explain means? infected people shedding virus? got Cadillac Vaccines! 

w00t w00t! got offered Moderna first got Pfizer cause everyone told better..oh well AstraZeneca? disgusting.I almost believe except we're watching happen right eyes.  MANY DEATHS DIRECTLY CAUSED D\*\*THSANTIS' ACTIONS. :( got booster yesterday. 10% adults said would absolutely refuse get vaccine. get really tired people Reddit generalizing half (or all) country based small minority people. TEAM MODERNA! LET'S GO  thinking first shot also gives immune response virus vector (the carrier spike protein). second tim around immune system also attacks carrier, reducing exposure time target protein.

Maybe smaller first dose limits that. idea they‚Äôre likely change that? I‚Äôll getting booster October 4 months pregnant hoping minimize chance running fever. little hot shot 2 technically fever. Gang gang .9%, mean. boosters go ever spread worse no? pregnant also makes risk Covid quantity quality. 

Pfizer produces quality anti bodies moderna produces quantity. like north american countries. quantity production.  dumb question. vaccines clearly beneficial yearly (flu).

If, hypothetically, COVID vaccines definitely like (I believe know yet, multiple examples 3 dose vaccines near lifelong protection), global production feasibly get level global demand? plan get there? problem Mr. Lube. time ton evidence sing dose mRNA vaccines nearly effective two doses 3-4 weeks apart. would‚Äôve allowed faster rollout threat efficacy. 

Luckily vaccine rollout occurred twice fast anticipated delay second dose well understood last March. boring cyberpunk accessory ever. wanted chrome fingers LIDAR mohawk now.

This pandemic work together regardless differences. acknowledged possibility ‚Äú‚Ä¶REGEN-COV could interfere body's ability fight future infection SARS-CoV-2.

SpikeVax: hero, Pfi-zero... changing dosage, anyone know updating official booster delta variant well? Makes sense too. Purely non-scientific anecdotal experience. sister-in-law Pfizer vaccines caught covid 2 months ago, in-laws moderna catch it. Los Angeles Police Department didn‚Äôt immediately respond request comment incidents.

I mean, Hannah Montana Miley Cyrus never room together... Seriously. got vaccine March felt like dodged covid. thought ""wow I'm gonna make probably never get covid long get vaccine every year however often tell to"". figured life would go back normal, especially us vaccinated.

There's least thousand people read story.

Do wanna one dies tube throat, want choose someone, would try make one does? 

Or give shit people dying preventable deaths? Umm.... According academic calendar, Fall 2021 semester starts tomorrow, think pretty safe say vaccinated now. Im trying invalidate it. birth bust going long covid states variety reasons. Covid made worse. saying reaction everyone commenting ‚Äúwho would even baby right now‚Äù answer is: many people. many still many Symptomatic COVID mattered came initial vaccine trials, primary endpoint analysis Pfizer Moderna vaccines. headlines back late 2020 widely touted public health experts truly stunning achievement. Recently, effectiveness COVID infection among frontline workers focus analysis released CDC. Spread involving fully vaccinated people reason change masking policy CDC, remains reason various travel restrictions US, including closing land border Canada without exceptions fully vaccinated visitors. Yet, comes booster policy, thing seems matter protection severe illness. need decide what's actually important, consistency health polices. Either symptomatic COVID spread involving fully vaccinated people matters, there's need boosters, matter many restrictions make little sense. wife (double jabbed) currently positive.

Both kids (neither jabbed) positive. Unmasking ignorance Florida Texas really trying kill poor people, elderly, children fast possible. manufacturer recommended dosage make sure trials last longer needed to

That's partly true... Moderna started trials weeks earlier Pfizer. Pfizer catch up, reduced time second dose week, made phase trial one week shorter Moderna. end, Pfizer got market one week earlier Moderna.  Yeah, talking hopefully taking positive news comes isn‚Äôt like going unmasked unvaccinated taking unnecessary risks.  worse environmental disaster hitting kids within next 20-30?

Can tell why? Remember nexus event New Orleans? It‚Äôs happening rule:

""The scientific literature conclusive extent impact

predicts lower infection rates, especially respect children.
1 department 
understands, however, body literature, scientific well 
survey/anecdotal, negative health consequences individuals, 
especially children, experience result prolonged mask wearing"" one confirmed died from""  investigate bit further. months time could really regret statement.

Just following up. ""few months"". We're 5 billion vaccine doses given worldwide.

Where danger? deaths? uh, seeing every southern state delta 90% hospitalizations unvaccinated despite less 50% people unvaccinated i'd question statement ""vaccinated individuals may worse symptoms new strains like delta"". would patently false would good ignore everything else said Sample size 2 - 5 months Pfizer shot 1012 total AB. study! High five Open windows cross-ventilation greatly reduce spread. Anyone ""old"" (50+, maybe 70+) who's 5+ months recent shot go get booster dose today greatly increase protection within days. Getting vaccination two unvaccinated help several weeks, unfortunatly. Shut moder fucker went back reread rule calmed down. I've come conclusion purpose rule grandstanding GOP base making life harder schools. uses word ""should"" ""shall"". suggestions schools do, do. rile anti maskers harassing schools with, ""but Governor said."" Well damn. Guess that's causes worse side effects then? Makes sense. avoided reason. SCIENCE! US may worst countries antivax problems. Sweden driven new age movement. Well, 25x likely hospitalized vaccinated people maybe reducing numbers hard way. Cares study uses Roche test. I'm arguing point right. can't discharge him. data J&amp;J Delta? seen alpha.  They're willing die.

It's wanting sound B.A. 

If someone put gun head, they'd take vaccine heartbeat. Schrodinger's Vaccine! got symptoms moderna friends family got Pfizer got sick ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Look C.1.2

Start wearing masks everywhere go. dine in. Act like first started except mindful delta strain even transmissible. third time? Sansa Clip+ custom firmware gang. Sad Pfizer noises. Pfizer Moderna interchangeable mRNA vaccines.

My first shot Pfizer, second Moderna holding Pfizer people 18 65+ (this Canada)1 70% vaccination rate? question many cases many vaccinated? need comparison available vaccines. initial vaccine moderna, doses booster j&amp;j.

Wonder stacks up. family‚Äôs delta. Three four adults got Moderna. P1: Coughing, tiredness, hospitalization. P2: Loss taste smell, three days moderate cold symptoms. P3: slight throat tickle. P4 (Pfizer): headache, body aches, moderate cold symptoms, tiredness loss taste/smell, hospitalization.

Unvaccinated child 12: positive, asymptotic. I‚Äôm convinced four vaccinated adults, plus continued masking distancing saved child ICU. What‚Äôs more, I‚Äôm equally convinced would lost least one parent this, gotten shot. Vaccines save lives!! giving vaccines day patients found mixing, 1/3 1/2 scheduled patients turned away appointment. ones? Serious question, didn‚Äôt think mandated.  Still waiting redemption AfricaZeneca What's OB? exactly *white whale* Captain DeSantis fervently chasing ? Bro, honestly people going get regardless. anti-vaxx, anti-mask movement south insane. feel bad kids shitty fucking parents. much protect kids south eligible vaccinated dumbass parents going launching bio weapons other's faces. Nah, don‚Äôt dirty P-shot hands Moderna vaccines. long people keep claiming vaccinated still risk people want booster shots. get whichever whenever can. Sacrilege Hey Dr. Racaniello, thanks this! curious opinion trajectory viral evolution Covid-19... likely see dangerous variants, transmissible variants, etc., Delta likely worst it? That‚Äôs great information, thank response. 

I suppose I‚Äôll explain situation primary physician next office visit see recommendation is.

I may going international business trip near future, want protected be. Thank you, Dolly! recovered covid J&amp;J shot back April. First day positive 102 fever worst it. following days minor headache day five pretty much symptomless. see ton availability today tomorrow Denver, work you? say sars-cov-2 become Endemic, implying vast vast majority population contract it? so, sooner rather later? There's huge difference getting infected versus 10 yrs forward hopefully effective therapeutic options cut risk hospitalization. Yes, also coming Isreal study otherwise bit misleading due timing/demographics/etc? Sure, looks like efficacy lower six months Moderna holds better, that's comparing direct timelines shot versus infection factoring potential dataset. 

Also, data level antibodies actually needed prevent infection? Without that, 1,000 2,000 could mean nothing 250 enough ward infection know? curious. Well ig it‚Äôs good thing got moderna waiting period shots different types, like asked got first shot vaccines within last 90 days something like that. outside that, pretty unlikely CDC ever give guidance like ""if got J&amp;J, come back get one others"" would look like casting doubt vaccine genuinely better nothing. would suggest talking doctor pharmacist it, perhaps mentioning feel susceptible based job exposure people, seeing say - especially area overabundance vaccines enough arms put in.   Based CDC briefing several weeks ago, I‚Äôd say yes. cited Mayo Clinic real world efficacy studies found Moderna holding 75% effective vs transmission (down 85%) Pfizer 44% effective vs transmission (down 85% also). you‚Äôve covid + vaccine you‚Äôre likely pretty well protected  Ok that's choice, I'm grown adult make decisions life assessing level risk others. Every adult chooses go bars events made risk assessment. People concerned catching virus free choose go wear mask do.  Doses ordered well advance delivery, even they‚Äôre manufactured, often. Countries could re-direct doses ordered countries (and that‚Äôs happening)‚Ä¶ doses ordered paid months ago, many cases. 

There aren‚Äôt really vaccines sitting shelves waiting bought; spoken purchases made ‚Äúnow‚Äù delivery future. point, major issue many countries still need doses cost ‚Äî cheaper portable vaccines (AZ JJ) manufacturing issues haven‚Äôt shipped planned, mRNA cost also require delivery infrastructure. thoughts booster shots young adults, 25 heart arrhythmia healthy otherwise. said risk bad outcome Delta? really gone work home would like start living life safely. One quick, thought timeline getting somewhat back normal United States? Thank you! imagine lot issues facing would easier manage eligible adults vaccinated. 
 
It implies trust science communitarian identity would solve lot, real always reason worry, choose believe kids make world better place. Maybe even help fix broken world. We‚Äôre resources, need learn use wisely. Nonetheless, Israel one vaccinated countries (#7), daily new infections virtually back January. people looking conclude vaccines limited time-dependent effectiveness. 

Are saying people reject boosters data Israel misconstrued? got mixed doses. I'm concerned we're still pandemic. Eventually data countries catch believe countries start accepting mixed doses fully vaccinated, especially mixed doses mRNA vaccines. guys already got better trade name, this. Comirnaty‚Ä¶ Sweet, lemme get Pfidernason &amp; Modzerson cocktail booster. state, Arkansas, recently threw away 80,000 vaccines expired. know Oklahoma something similar soon after. Austin winter storm saw cases fall off. cliff dive didn‚Äôt get worse. Hoping hurricane similar situation. Bonnarroo weekend too‚Ä¶ efficacy really good way compare vaccines highly influenced time location studies done. J&amp;J's studies done later point pandemic virus spread even more. vaccines done time they'd efficacy rate wish. they're not- I'm sure people think are. mean Floridians artificially still alive? primary care provider? call ask place order get test clinic lab lab associated clinic Link? like come World Warcraft usernames. It‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter AstraZeneca‚Äù vaccine way straight fraud? probably get booster mrna, wait public health make recommendation. J&amp;J designed Africa, I'm surprised approved US. totally anecdotal suggest get test confirm friend mine recently antibody test found 0 antibodies j&amp;j shot. Idk long ago got shot faded away doctor suggested go get one two dose shots high risk. currently live safest time human history, things considered. Humans procreating antiquity, disease famine norm. perhaps worse poor conditions medieval times. Archaic hominins also made babies despite suffering inevitably endure. fate humanity, better live all. insane craving propogate species matter conditions. 

As Dostoevsky puts it: 
*""if one live high rock, narrow ledge he'd room stand, ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, remain standing square yard space life, thousand years, eternity, better live die once. live, live live! Life, whatever may be!""* Honestly uses different mechanism believe heard NPR booster could useful correct answer ""that's great question, ask doctor."" also generally curious question, got Pfizer. Plus ignoring amount people moving states. Houses selling within hour listed around Orlando, sure elsewhere.

Yay. mattered everyone vaccinated united states. new variants spread countries well. new variant recently found that's gaining traction care vaccine. Thank sharing this!  mean like submit records vaccines 6 diseases allowed enroll classes Master's degree? paranoid exposure, least 5 months since last dose, get booster shot 1+ week event. far cheaper effective anything else prevent spread.  share similar stories think one even worse cases. Deep really sad know, seen family 2 years people. stopped caring anti-vaxers, plenty time, information recourses available anyone make right decision. Biggest rift since Orangereds vs Periwinkles. Wow hell yes! looks like J&amp;J [looking wanna learn it, I'd suggest recent [UCSF grand immunity, boosters, delta, etc.

In short, know level antibodies declines gradually time. effect vaccine dependent antibody levels. Antibodies fast acting agents immune system. also memory T-cells (CD4, CD8) memory B-cells. response cells active infection takes longer (a days), protection lasts many years. Studies generally report antibody levels that's easier measure B memory cell levels. overall response depends both, signs vaccines producing robust response B cells addition high initial antibody counts. really depends concert tbh. saw orville peck madison WI weeks ago id say 60-75% people masks. pleasantly surprised. wonder still saying ICU. British media reported cases people around 40 years old ended ICU unvaccinated regretted decision. They've gone die it.

Couple media US needs get stories like people. maybe even work. Unfortunately trip ICU convince some. AINT GETTIN VAXXED GET FUCk CLUB US pace eliminate Alpha every non-Delta lineage back then, still are. awful last comment got pre vaccine availability, information see. 

Part issue gets delayed allergic reaction reason. two days later ended hospital.

She definitely careful right understandably frustrated current state things. Mkay bye  mix different vaccines punch bowl inject me? No, drug that's available since December 2020. Anecdotal short story: part two couples hanging long ago, vaxed. days meeting, guy couple got Covid one else (all tested). one Moderna, rest us got Pfizer.  

Luckily symptoms extremely minor, basically nothing, due vaccine. 

Also 5G whole time free, thanks Obama.  think CDC could done anything much differently predicted backlash crazy people. That's discussion Antivax coworkers.

I fully respect choice refuse vaccine lass degree wearing mask, accept consequences actions.

Their choice endangering others like gun owners demanding right shoot around random claim gun rights.

If stay isolated away others, fine absolute right infect others like 50% adult population vaxxed good amount people exposed wouldn‚Äôt running hosts soon - number tracking many people caught Covid aren‚Äôt vaxxed - wonder anti-vaxxers would feel sent special covid wards either recover die minimal medical intervention? covidiots causing collapse health system. simply fair majority ppl who've done part &amp; gotten shots. anti-vaxxers Free Riders who're taking advantage generous medical system treats patients equally, without regard vaccination status. favorite people post ONE article/video find fits agenda scream hills..‚ÄùI told so!!!‚Äù. Completely ignoring countless articles say otherwise. Actual scientists say ‚Äúmore better‚Äù ‚Äúit quality antibodies, quantity‚Äù ‚Äúthere diminishing return point‚Äù comes antibody count.  
So, let‚Äôs get worked more. sound German, vaccine actually German. developed German company BioNTech. Pfizer partner clinical trials/logistics/production.  world producing 10 billion vaccines year. Booster shots couple billion people amount 2 3 month delay rollout countries. enough doses vaccinate everybody earth end 2022, including rich people booster shots. Whether logistically get shots arms another question altogether. CDC isn‚Äôt business giving personalized health recommendations. That‚Äôs doctor. CDC gives public health recommendations, best thing public many people vaccinated regardless long last effective are.   also severe / common side effects consequence? Moderna 3.3x larger dose. booster lower dose size probably fine (moderna's trialing half-dose boosters).

Get moderna dose want. state going anything. probably worth hassle. I've heard, believe wish anecdotal evidence, J&amp;J appears get effective time, point slightly worse mRNA least point (roughly 4 6 months out). 
 
Every see headline ""J&amp;J appears effective"" instead paper, press release CDC J&amp;J details. doctor told disproportionate amount J&amp;J amongst breakthrough infections (which know that's still true) try get mRNA there's something saying it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* guess thats hydroxychloroquine people lol?  Hell yeaaaaaaa!!! Moderna gang represent. true. they're trying get 40% eligible people US vaccinated yet. can't imagine US stops buying many would cover people tell oh sorry can't get believe letting third world countries get unvaccinated decide come around get shots. would going best interests US citizens. US buying enough people want it, 0 problem people getting boosters rather garbage Let‚Äôs go (moderna guy checking in)  No. results got type test number. two people know got tested study got 459 1023, guess pretty accurate? Rome wasnt facing ecological destruction. Booster increase efficacy Delta pass antibodies pregnancy breastfeeding (if applicable) Fellow J&amp;J here, still 88% chance protected getting infected, still minor symptoms all. 

You still well protected covid dude. CDC guidance still right guidance. true best vaccine whatever get.

I mean, get going aggregate, objectively best vaccine *not* J&amp;J vaccine. 

When comes CDC, vaccinations, individual health, one area hindsight acceptable justification bit upset. mRNA vaccines clearly effective data quickly authorize boosters; clearly better choice vaccine Pfiser Moderna. Yup - followed public health guidance got vaccinated ASAP, regardless brand can‚Äôt schlep around world get zoom foreign meetings? 

That‚Äôs big ol‚Äô win/win.  Half-blood scum!!!! Fuck studies vaccine safety teenagers? mother want little sister get vaccine.. trying crypto bro, ever going use case NFT‚Äôs, vaccine cards seem way Part problem, &amp; people, lot non-nurse medical staff regularly &amp; regularly asked perform tasks normally handled actual nurse. Understaffing caused low pay nursing &amp; medical staff paired significant chronic nationwide shortage trained &amp; qualified medical professionals, profit squeezing &amp; BS caused situation unqualified individuals asked perform certain lower skill nursing duties staff available completely swamped.

From there, one step people start think nursing staff. Agreed. feel like we‚Äôve spent last several years one conspiracy theory another. Chem trails planes control weather, windmills cause cancer etc. point say best available science says vaccines work want go airplanes sporting events etc. basically ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù need show proof vaccine. probably can‚Äôt change behavior, change ours. First must eliminate single-dose infidels, mRNA wars begin earnest.  double edged sword covid sick leave. one hand feel who've gotten shots &amp; done everything they're told prevent breakthrough infections, yet still wind take days paycheck test positive. Yet, covid penalty may encourage who're fence (particularly younger teachers 30) go ahead &amp; get vaccinated get get jail free card. vast vast majority Delta surge attributed unvaxxed face financial repercussions testing positive winding hospital. still receive paycheck, insurance covers 95% medical treatment.  Decline vaccine you‚Äôre hook cover entire hospital bill. People don‚Äôt give crap it‚Äôs hits pocket. probabky fine J J. slightly less effective.  born blood, made men blood, undone blood. eyes yet open. Fear Old Blood. seem like know vaccines. AsrraZeneca aka Covishield? That's get India aside Covaxin

And covishield 12 weeks gap now, 4 earlier. article saying 3 B cells (maybe cells) enough rats fend disease. cells pump antibodies rapidly virus comes body. really need understand interaction better since antibodies wane memory cells remain fight future infection. Purge heretic Yeah split Isn‚Äôt link referring using current supply booster. Pfizer says working real booster targets Delta. 

This one going put emergency use‚Ä¶ one reason think want 8 months between. 
[Pfizer don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve done studies people getting 2-initial original doses, one original dose booster, going 8 months another. 

I think get third now. may eligible booster targeting delta helpful. basically. means nothing. 


One hospital. 

It says werent exposed dont believe know sure. Small sample. Large sample size several sites.

Also mean hispanic/black/asian?

What acceptable line antibodies? rate decline? example need 50 antibodies per nanoliter effective pfizer gives 500 moderna 990 moot. 

If day 14 pfizer 400 moderna 600, day 60 pfizer is200 moderna 202. on.


Thats hospitizations death good clinical outcomes. 

Both vaccines work great. Period. Otherwise would see huge jumps hospitalizations pfizer group. Honestly 8000 hospitalized dead completely vaccinated many moderna vs pfizer? Also 75% 65 up. means likely get pfizer moderna approved. even would account accessibility. 

Studies like dont really help except get researchers funding first dose pfizer second dose got moderna pfizer supply issues live. Thanks interesting feedback! 

I edited comment response add second paragraph, test results say precision level is? I‚Äôve recently learned Moderna much higher efficacy Delta Vs. Pfizer. finished Pfizer series 7 months ago I‚Äôm considering going getting moderna. anyone know NY tell I‚Äôm lying get third dose penalties may be? Threw little mouth Rant:

Wife tested positive one at-home Walgreens (binaxNOW antigen self-test) tests. 

Practically symptoms, mild congestion originally attributed poor air quality due wildfires. 

So I'm trying get tested I've directly exposed, can't find anywhere get test. Walgreens sold in-home tests on-site tests dozen+ places I've looked booked least 48 hours.

How deep pandemic, 1.5 years in, still testing limitations? 

We pushed vaccine record time. developed, mass produced, distributed numerous different types tests, moved earth make situation better, still can't get test need one. 

What gives???

I'm Denver btw. Big city like test availability! Child murderer No, sound reasonable. want vaccine, putting society deliberately harm's way. Completely predictable yet school administrators choose reopen looser restrictions. many students faculty die result negligence? began loosely recommending April, yes. recommendation also said ‚Äúwe know deeply personal decision [we] encourage people talk doctors talk doctors primary care providers determine best babies.‚Äù official guidance CDC website remained vaccines ‚Äúshould withheld pregnant women‚Äù August 11. 

It‚Äôs shame waited long make urgent outright recommendation. Ah explains can't find üò≥ required reading every news reporter. I've heard several doctors past two weeks suggest J&amp;J recipients seek two doses mRNA vaccine, stating combination two types would likely offer extremely high protection. :( got Pfizer *and* COVID prior? enough antibodies join party? get moderna first Pfizer ? (can longer smell pig mile away) [I'll living way eliminate viral disease prevent cause first place. try eradicate retrospectively infect animals like chicken mutate spread back humans, won‚Äôt eradicating IMO. really need address cause pandemics it‚Äôs generally treat animals. I'm balancing non watering 'lecteolytes side! Due October Oh no, portland pd might.... continue protect people. lots grumbling time! kind hilarious - delay second shots: chorus complaint. Bring second shots forward: chorus complaint. Free lollipop shot: probably also chorus complaint. got two different results, one type. Idk that's standard test different options.

Pfizer moderna work similarly. J&amp;J different type technology, get types antibodies. 

Side note: friend also signed study vaccine covid twice. (N) antibodies either. 

Just know questions....she covid early year, got vaccine months that, got covid month. literally cried big fat ugly happy tears saw this.  worry, EU standard Digital Covid Certificate (DCC) show last vaccine vendor, many doses total.
Sooooo, long country accepts DCC, actually know.

Assuming Canada issues those, might stretch. read articles portion talking agencies ""science leaking"" gave feeling wanted ones declare rather another agency. Thank verifying getting sense of. 5 weeks apart... curious antibody level 4 months. stop making sense. haven‚Äôt gotten shot yet go ahead get moderna shud mix Yes, understand many people work, kids need school. summer wonder school can't pushed back vaccine. Pfizer also measure proteins list units/mL? total two types J+J get two different counts? 

Also, idea confidence interval/precision count? 623 specific number, I'd expect 600 620 values. Accurate single digit seems almost good true. Exactly - Florida. insane.  Pope vocal necessity getting vaccinated. Wow. Much tragic. Happened local county Michigan. Hard listen to: friend got dose Pfizer top J&amp;J he‚Äôs fine far. surprised bit information people Belgium (like me) 5 weeks two Pfizer shots. sure changed strategy wait 5 weeks instead 3 probably hospital workers got shots. getting information? don‚Äôt buy another country going chiropractor get covid? think so. problem? wife Astrazeneca pfizer .... Well fab got Pfizer Seriously? - chiropractor isn‚Äôt considered ‚Äúmedical doctor‚Äù /s Terrifying. feel extremely fortunate  could buy less don‚Äôt throw away doses bunch studies like especially last year. causes increases decreases cases many, behavior stage ""wave"" certain area variant dominant, hard compare two areas everything else difference people wear masks. said never lot hard evidence reduced spread. Covishield seems like best name here. Straight point exactly want. Yes, read remember lot people around me, including myself, repeated idea. But, really, ""burden"" get vaccinated? never convincing message someone thinks vaccine bad. would go get vaccine already thought bad labelled ""burden""?

It's message need ourselves, though, realize justified shutting people society. greater good, sometimes make sure others suffer bad choices bad thinking. me, power Atlantic article. Maybe hurts enough change thinking. know, right?! LMAO every Canadian (and anyone else) refused Moderna wanted good shot. Serves right vaccine shopping. People would actually leave found moderna offered. Gross. I'm 6 months jabs. I'm going become antibody. data wait longer 4 weeks? many places Sweden, expected wait 7-8 weeks dose 1 2, wonder result meaningful difference. terrible mistake politicize scientific decisions communication, matter party it.

Washington needs stop trying time tweak pandemic information manipulate people's behavior. tell us science says. unfortunately, delta variant, may need higher % people vaccinated reach herd immunity. 

Regardless, good people EU continuing vaccinated.  Hi, roommate (as well friends) tested positive covid today. major symptoms yet vaccinated. isolate/quarantine together since time periods 10 days avoided? trouble finding guidance really bothered type name Google? LET MOMENT Reminds Agnes Skinner ""Well invited, must invited to!"" here. Got first dose Pfizer January second past weekend 8 months. Arm felt way sore time though. fatigue. guess theyre testing half doses, surely wouldnt able data available subsequently approve 20th right? im assuming itll standard dose. one knows. still amazes viruses discovered 130 years ago, imaged electron microscope 90 years ago. Louis Pasteur developed vaccines without even *fully* aware existance viruses. distort figures make peak look less severe. ""average person"" pandemic likely experienced job loss experience job loss, received income combination stimulus payments expanded UI.

I made mistake saying ""clearly"", reality cut dry. 

I say, anecdotal experience, werent working ""safe"" industry, pretty much screwed months. Service industry, entertainment, basically anything deemed essential. 

My brother didnt start getting unemployment payments deposited July, calling daily starting April. relying income cover living expenses make lost income, probably thinking kids suddenly money coming temporarily. 

On top that, I'd imagine suddenly live welfare government assistance would probably negative impact someone wanting kids not. know people well kids time, thats different set circumstances someone sees quality life drop rapidly (relatively speaking) short period time. 

 Theres also difference income, consistent income. lost job April 2020, collected payments unemployment, werent able find replacement job match previous salary, still seems like step backwards, especially wanted kids, considering lot people spent stimulus/unemployment either a) existing debt b) cover current living expenses. 

Im sure cases people saved appropriately reinvested money paid off, id wager cases minority. 

Obviously matter personal opinion/speculation. Sorry kind comments always strike hysterical insular. Every generation thinks living end times. 40 years ago people talking exactly terms threat global nuclear war, event would precipitated global societal collapse way makes climate change look like fucking tea party. live West, still one safest times human history born. Look life expectancy infant mortality 100 200 years ago. Look less prosperous parts world. ancestors wrong procreate? life horrific pre-modern pre-industrial times life worth living relative danger hardship? fact humans incredibly resilient get used living conditions quickly. Happiness [relatively time despite major positive negative life events, happy life type person actual living circumstances. seems self-indulgent project standard kind life worth living onto past future generations.

As climate change, also can't predict anything even approaching certainty changes standards living it. precise effects climate ecosystems, success failure mitigation adaptation efforts - huge unknowns.  important part individual immunity.

But active antibodies important short term community immunity, since stop infection takes replicates much.  going up! 42% least 1 dose! Yup. Lots childless people forget children exist, too, count amount unvaccinated population. worried makes us careful. can‚Äôt careful already am:

This government's need careful, i.e. mandates, regulations etc. think little garbled. term speaking ‚Äúex cathedra‚Äù literally means ‚Äúfrom chair‚Äù. throne St. Peter big chair, mean clearly speaking head church, like call head committee ‚Äúchair‚Äù.

And (looking up) conditions need met, including matter faith/morals. isn‚Äôt every time opens mouth, even teaching faith morals. legit question. would happen full Pfizer dose, got Moderna vaccine well? Would bad? want get one got Janssen March. live Socal, walk centers everywhere. Could turn away get legal/financial trouble getting one? Obviously none responses would legal medical advice. seeing anybody else done it. really interesting tangent. kid used get pretty bad bronchitis every fall/winter. I'd deal awhile eventually miserable enough we'd go doctor he'd give antibiotics.

Now, everything read antibiotics done nothing, recollection within 24 hours I'd feeling substantially better. coincidence? happened least 3 times sure seemed like antibiotics helping significantly. Yes, upset consulted first Biden made announcement. literally talked first boosters came up. clear, original announcement boosters made FDA head CDC.  I'm really sure basically every state developed system rather work together. got Pfizer top J&amp;J. I‚Äôm Hulk! really know. (And I'm really sure answer disease either.)

Antibodies always wane time, that's work. small portion immune system, especially concerning long term immunity. I'm sure we're decline, maybe countries growing faster?

I also see cycles, cycles different many dimensions; example, reduced child poverty 25%, f..ing amazing, right? people think plans based months old information subject change new information comes light circumstances change? people stupid can't imagine first pandemic century might require flexible response ""we thing done, right""? not.   coworkers would agree‚Ä¶if could identify ;) Hardly hit back meh

Had idea going on
