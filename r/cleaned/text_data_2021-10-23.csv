Chicagoan... fired spot? Chance given. Chance taken. Terminate employment. also hijacks immune system spread body (which literally weaken host's immune system YEARS).

Yes, nastiness measles greatly underrated. argued official death toll measles drastically underrates true death toll, since counts deaths acute infection. significantly greater number people likely die pathogens measles literally erased immune memory pathogens, killing memory cells. weakening immune system say, specific, particularly nasty way, different form types immune suppression. Here's pretty interesting study covering this:

[Long-term measles-induced immunomodulation increases overall childhood infectious disease introduction mass measles vaccination reduced childhood mortality 30 50% resource-poor countries (5–8) 90% impoverished populations (9, 10). observed benefits cannot explained prevention primary measles virus (MV) infections alone (11, 12), remain central mystery (13).   words, MV infection replaced previous memory cell repertoire MV-specific lymphocytes, resulting “immune amnesia” (17) nonmeasles pathogens. Previous investigations virus-induced memory-cell depletion suggest recovery requires re-stimulation, either directly via cross-reactive antigens (26–29).   results show **when measles common, MV infections could implicated many half childhood deaths infectious disease**, thus accounting nearly interannual fluctuations childhood infectious disease deaths. **The reduction MV infections main factor reducing overall childhood infectious disease mortality introduction vaccination.** \[emphasis added reddit commenter\]

Note study 2015. big effect is, massively we've benefited measles vaccination, recently becoming understood. wrong?

Yes.  one unpower reviewed study definitely I'd definitive findings.  Theres zero cause effect elderly people got vaccinated died often compared everyone else. International travel sounds like great reason vaccinated, least. they're bark bite nearly many like believe tell us about? reasonable take see here.  city safer without them. difference situation hospitals getting clogged ~~antivaxxers~~ **fatties** entirely preventable. they'd listened science ~~taken vaccine offered them~~ **stop eating much** - like normal, rational people - selfishly hogging medical resources could otherwise helped someone else need.

If experienced side effects prior, likely okay one. experienced same, far minor. wonder modern interconnectedness overpopulation contributing one lasting long normal cycle

The 1918 flu pandemic lasted couple years spread almost entire globe -- even remote Alaska native villages spared -- widespread commercial air travel. got comparatively lucky epidemics since then; original SARS burned thousand cases. However suspect 1957 1968 flu pandemics might spread faster gotten worse world interconnected now.  article implies one card lmao honestly don’t know percentage, I’d say less 5%. Prior delta wave really trying avoid intubation. seems leanings toward intubating sooner someone completely exhausted themselves, apparent going to. work community hospital doesn’t ECMO transplants ventilation fails options, there’s really chance transferring covid patients facilities waitlisting. me. feel anything Moderna all. 

Did get half dose Moderna? I'm fretting gotten full dose Moderna. Got Pfizer today. Feel like Goku going super Saiyan right get full dose half dose Moderna?

My schedule similar yours. 2 Pfizer half dose Moderna.

After Moderna - felt nothing.  effect whatsoever. even arm soreness. Moderna 100 mcg slightly efficacious Pfizer 30 mcg.

Now Moderna literally half 50 mcg, Pfizer same.

Not sure allowed Moderna half dose booster protection obviously way lower full dose. feel like considered anti vaxx term, vaccines super good, need new normal, covid likely another cold go back normal. Fire MFrs lots jobs people! gotta vaxxed! barely even took name haha Interesting news. 


broadly neutralizing antibodies"" also prevent transmission sterilize host infection? reliable, longer lasting improvement flu shot like approach currently have?  always globally scoped course  irresponsible government.

Every single case counted towards number infections here. 

Everyone tests often, schools work places alike.

The delta variant strong despite 99% counted cases utterly asymptotic still counted towards daily numbers.

Vaccines definitely helpful preventing serious illnesses death unfortunately much older Singaporeans resistant getting old way beliefs. upvotes sir me. I'll 110% say straight out, post way less ask virtually zero questions discussions answers.. straight attacks downvotes. 

I've noticed pretty big trend last year people told stance subject, argumentative points need arise, anything complete agreement need attack. sides guilty horrible stops debates discussions dead tracks.

I'm going try college thursday, dealing stupid bs.  Pfizer started measuring day 7 tests, effectively peak antibodies.   Let guess, actual capacity analyze situation result name calling rather thinking.

... I'm liberal, realistic. Perhaps prisoners need file class action lawsuit 8th Amendment grounds. state trash.

Highly vaxed areas unaffected, seen northeastern US delta surge major affect hospitals. Sorry experience trash state bordered trash. Yea, don’t correlate protection yet. it’ll part yearly checkup: COVID titers high enough? boost. depressing that's actually happening, certainly unprecedented. lot people say one thing public peer pressure another thing private: example, end spectrum, there's known phenomenon whereby people claim support parties left, actually vote ones right. 
 
If know better, I'd speculate people might among vocal anti vaccine posters online, want avoid suspicion (a bit like closeted gay man acting super homophobic one points finger him). bought boxes. Pack opening addicting.  Antivaxxers even understand maths? deliberate FUD?

If say **hypothetically** vaccinated represent 95% population 0.2% die, unvaxxed 5% population 2% die, given month vaxxed individuals die antivaxxed *across whole population.*

Does mean unvaxxed **individual** better chance 2% risk death vaxxed individual 0.2%.

Obviously not. better metric simply:

**What percentage population died last month Covid19?**

That metric shows unvaxxed far ones risk. hospital capacity care there, either hate everyone self inflicted reasons none think it’s solid mix Always reply. y'all think something new?

Fat people around millenia. overwhelming medical resources taking medical resources away others. Yes, obesity harmful, obese person harming anyone themselves.

And FYI, yes, detest smokers.   hence USA tag heard today outbreak relative’s school Belgium, town 90% vaccination rate, next city 70% rate. course, adults vaccinated, it’s still spreading among children. envying return normal life. guess it’s soon stop careful. biggest issue article doesn’t show percent population, many unvaccinated many died. would need death rate per 100K compare fairly think you’re giving people way much credit. people don’t need subjected psyop. They’re naturally stupid.  They're well trained probably expensive Probably pretty great way filtering ultra-right racist cops. unpaid leave? fire them? seems like gift able get rid stubbornly stupid 5% workforce. Presumably hoping change minds. one bombarded misinformation virus vaccines months, based ones views misinformation, takes people time admit they've wrong. thing spinning mathematicians graves.  letting anyone without double dose attend venues even cases. 

That news me, Googling, cannot see getting from. closest see this:

*Restrictions – 80% additional public health restrictions apply unvaccinated people. details confirmed. example, venues events require patrons staff vaccinated may able operate without public health restrictions. However, venues events allow unvaccinated people may continue subject range public health restrictions capacity density limits.*

But Qld 80% yet, are, intend stay zero (no quarantine domestic entry).

So comment comes across rather misleading me? Unless, back way?  “Stop resisting!”  Oh, lot gaffes!  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Thanks clarifying well misinformation drinking from. make safer, statistically, yes, bears likely kill unvaxed people.  ever living fuck talking about? That's true. Wait depression condition allowed booster? moderna 1&amp;2 little confused mix match boosters. 

Basically gives protection?  Children vaccinated, seasonal effect dampens R little natural immunity due winter wave buildt up.   let little fart. Also, lots medical systems owned private equity firms (which think absolutely case). private equity owners try optimize fuck everything extract money system shareholders. second biggest anti-virus initiative, EOL-ing Flash Player.      hell happened hookers blow? dipshit.    Yea, normal reserved vaxxed people.
Restrictions still needed applied non vaccinated people ( recently also people get booster shot )

The restriction think fully vaccinated(+booster) masks closed places wonder medical corporation CEOs make There's sort cult around refusing think terms opportunity costs  Police unions always freedom leave work smaller companies smaller offices need mandate vaccination everyone law. Otherwise normal company update regulations cope new problems aka. protect itself. think problem people dont think themself threat exposed crowd unvaccinated. like uncaring apartment leave infested rats flies cockroaches whole building suffers. thought meant bad guys?  'Tough''? mask wearing proof vaccination go places high risk tough bloody hell. Plan B barely help all, something along.

Mate gotta catch 'em tells front. make rules... Germany already giving third doses vulnerable. sure you’re getting downvoted. exact question. 

Im getting feeling cut dose based information moderna vaccinated people getting third dose J&amp;J vaccinated people. don’t know offers similar protection J&amp;J group.  simple. First, majority people vaccinated. skews percentages. So, Ireland's case, 10% vaccinated people 90% unvaccinated people. issues like higher risk groups likely vaccinated. example 100% people 80, highest risk group, fully vaccinated. person 80 60 times likely die Covid person aged 30 39. Even vaccinated people die Covid. die much lower rate vaccinated. Thirdly, high risk people like immuno-compromised would also overwhelmingly vaccinated. Finally, immunity busy waning, know happens. older people vaccinated January February Ireland. need boosters.  Oh will. always rapid, way way way way late. problem don’t care people getting sick COVID.

Its also problem care people getting sick COVID.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Sadly lack human interactions last 2 yrs created nasty environment. People think way highway, think discussion, sides! frustrating. honestly makes sense whatsoever. 

However, u learn talk one another help one another come mutual understanding, action happens. 

People know afraid vax, eventually got it. Why? sat explained heard wrong. misinformation, that’s trigger word many, explained interpreted wrong. Yes x z it, u eat iron magnesium metals too. isn’t like injecting lead paint ur veins. simplified explanations them. helped understand level, mine someone else’s level. takes lot patience, lot work months some, eventually everyone comes around. Mind u always lost causes, see bad side effects people going happen them, even chance it? explanation is, u take 15 pills day, horrible possible side effects, u none. U need help people understand one another. Look habits true fear tackle them, together. 

Forcing anyone something divulge health information, wrong. don’t force people say hepatitis aids work restaurant, horrid viruses/diseases. Look stomach flu constantly hits restaurants, like chipotle, washing hands use bathroom. Simplistic acts people still cannot do. 

U bring horse water cannot force drink it. wrong today. People want force beliefs onto others, force want, rather educate enlighten other. hope people stop madness, start treating one another like decent human beings compassion kindness. world needs heal, seeing insanity. Repeating behavior expecting difference outcome. It’s time start speak help heal rather attack one another wanting understand more. 

I faith it’ll happen others feel way do, eventually kindness compassion spreads. Funny thing Americans financial lack resource access healthcare that’s back end. get help destitute get bill. forget that.  Police training US costs fraction compared countries one must assume, given fraction mandatory training time. Unless guys somehow manage make cost actual degrees police first world countries get.  21 cops believe public safety longer working. would call win People PR also know lack resources local hospitals cannot afford get sick. act refusing vaccine likely happen within construct abundance (real perceived). What's gained? Losing idiot avoiding person vulnerable disease vector. Aww man. Yeah always seem get short end stick. Well ever want change pace still use degree always stuff like MSF, Mercy Ships, etc. cost police department getting sued infecting people firing bad officers bare minimum required work public That's it? Mandates work! europe countrys wich made job quitting healthcare workers felony,

Which countries?  also hit roadblocks countries received them. countries difficulties vaccines   stupid shit makes reddit unreadable. Police academy expensive. hate cops make cost disappear bad joke. terminated despite costs? Yes should.

You absolutely discriminated Ok protect rights fucking virus people want grow it. Cool. sound like every single antivax conspiracy theorist. Nothing you’ve said original. Log smell roses bit. Thousands millions. 

Even Covid anti-vaxxers constituted small percentage population due attention-seeking antics perceived bigger. take many cause major threat majority, though. 

The thousands workers willing lose job rather vaccinated confirm absolute necessity vaccine mandates. cannot reason someone reasoned into. Nothing, absolutely nothing, going change mind efforts try likely backfire cause become entrenched. society work towards mitigating risk pose measures like vaccine mandates. returning office ""reward"" getting shot, count out. Similar me. also got COVID arm time, large, ugly, painful, still worth it!  Maybe it’s lack socializing living less cognitively demanding life locked away like barnyard animals “lockdown”? looks like antivax people looking handout since scared needle. 🤣 millions get vaccinated. real lose decision.  ""Stupid stupid does."" anti vax anyway vaccinated. 

But let's honest, losing many jobs would probably good thing.  required repress virus R0 3. Delta R0 6-8.

It's going work time, unless 85% population maintains current boosted vaccination best vaccine available world - use.  Okay gets care homeless poverty stricken? way start care affects them. suddenly understand homeless people poor people actually lazy ignored? Honestly, next years interesting lol. point, variant even close amount genetic difference flu subtypes. That's there's still lot protection delta original vaccines. delta-specific boosters trials now... hopefully winds happening need bit tweak year every years still fully protected, people miss boosters still protection past vaccinations and/or infections.

The point is, there's still reason optimistic. 

As particular outbreak, China's going get control one way another coming weeks  deserve jobs. Would love see immunization records people children.

Have revisit vaccines already put children's bodies because, guess what, states vaccine mandate order attend school. 

Holy shit, right decide put children's body already violated! vaccine different  using mRNA vaccines far know - sinovac inactivated virus vaccine. good we'd using west. 

So that's additional problem. locked hundreds millions apartments weeks, barely allowing out. implemented dystopian social credit system. They’re limiting number hours people play video games. 

Somehow, maybe, think may able get high vaccination rate.  2nd Moderna shot wiped 3 days. fever, aches pains, tired slept. 7 months since 2nd shot. I'm going wait one month booster since I'm planning month long vacation Christmas New Year's. want maximum antibodies trip. think mandate would beneficial line, first employees sit meeting actual physician allow concerns addressed answered.

My company (affected vaccine mandate) done webinars throughout year Doctors explaining benefits getting vaccinated trying correct misinformation. staff less two weeks get final dose, two weeks upload documentation. We're less month d-day still 15% unvaccinated (~800 people). K bye. Thanks ammo get antibody tests pretty regularly part study I’m in. numbers really don’t give data far protection levels, “did body produce antibody response? Y/N” kind thing, least individual level. also requires report positive Covid tests even confirmed encounters help start measuring protections people specific health condition. see numbers mean almost nothing unless point population-level thresholds created. I’m also T-cell study that’s fully blinded even me. earliest data shows producing antibodies also higher rate producing t-cell response that’s limited data. 

I really wouldn’t recommend average person get antibody test. I’m specific scenario blood cancer survivor medical research study far likely produce response. Blood cancer patients survivors excluded vaccine trials data collected like going hopefully help show need special upgrades vaccines immunocompromised.  here’s fallacy. It’s nothing media. safety vaccines established scientific testing. Proper, monitored, double blind trials 50,000 people time. results peer-reviewed publication. It’s nothing pharmaceutical companies, media. excuses aren’t relevant subject matter.

On plus side, article says it’s around 1% crazies. good job America, that’s lot better could been. could probably negotiate raise. That's months ago. Told get raise going travel nursing could hire back 3x paying me. happy matter. work friend I'm concerned Mr. Benjamin. Lol seriously understand percentages work?

In population there's 90% vaxxed, 100 people get sick, higher percentage vaxxed patients.

Is hard understand? real basic stuff man.  isn’t it? certainly capacity produce more, faster year ago. got x% vaccinated within year, couldn’t keep up? 

It appears currently don’t need update formula, likely use lower dose, least mRNA vectors. Boy anything deserves good news tag   Got paid 10 cents hour got kicked square dick every morning boss, builds character.  Archived link: vanity fair article good too: situation. suspect we'll never get bottom it, optics great NIH. I’m understanding right, tested people covid. show impairment don’t know tested covid? surprising. Reminds people protested last summer bars closed 1 instead 2 Wednesdays - dangerous covid is, one many health issues people face. Guess people want work days.....🙃 Sounds like need log off. You’re hero action movie you’ve made mind.  said clearly makes anti-vax. I've heard many times. thinking, go doctor hospital anything? part society?  THOUSANDS! Don’t go public get near anyone. People selfish deserve respect.  call even bullshit that. Mandate vaccines see show jab. actual cowards spine kick upwards.   I’m conspiracy theorist antivax

Yes are.   travel within province? 

I became travel nurse 2012 first place went different city within home state. 

I’m sure it’s different pharmacists, within travel career, I’ve seen healthcare professions become travelers since literally everyone needed everywhere (RT, PT, MD, etc). data ends Dec 2020, that's look vaccines. must seeing something aren’t

""I heard guy, doctor, get shot, must seeing something magical almost rest world's doctors, medical researchers, public health governments didn't.""

I sick empty arguments. seem sort real argument anyone?

If people dying every day disease, care.

Here Netherlands local spike, 18000 total cases Friday, Saturday today. That's right, one person thousand got COVID _this weekend_.

And people take seriously here. would REALLY like know people made shit up. people made bullshit conspiracy theories believe themselves, since made up. make crap up?    there’s mountain evidence corrupt shit

No isn't. are, vaccination mandates service workers recently implemented. wonder what’s tv. GOOD RIDDANCE! Let starve! well works fine get new delta variant popping up, pretty much guaranteed. Even yearly shots logistical nightmare.. people take end 60% less vaccinated population    Thousands say? Shrug.

I guess thousands intelligent people happily take jobs.  hesitant wanted children point soon confident data regarding that

There data showing covid vaccine linked infertility. (Academically) Intelligent people immune propaganda/misinformation. You’ve unwittingly spread misinformation post  This.

We also anticipate mutations early pandemic, think A/B/C maybe D614G initial trials. finally, vaccine death.     Great, means get better job said didn’t vax spikes, need now?

Why sort reasonable argument??! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Endemic Covid-19 Arrived Portugal. Looks Like.

 
Portugal, one world’s highest coronavirus vaccination rates, recently lifted many restrictions cautious return normality 
LISBON—In soccer-crazed capital soccer-obsessed nation, stadiums full again. Portugal, country ravaged earlier year Delta variant coronavirus, highest Covid-19 vaccination rate Europe offers glimpse country trying come grips increasingly looking like endemic virus. 
Tens thousands screaming soccer fans crammed Estadio da Luz Wednesday watch hometown favorites Benfica take Bayern Munich. amassed subway stadium, entrance officials patted and, game, food trucks downed sandwiches beer tried forget drubbing team received. 
The government recently lifted 30% capacity limit stadiums imposed control Covid-19. things haven’t returned were: Fans need certificate showing vaccinated, recently recovered disease tested negative. Masks obligatory throughout stadiums. 
Close 100% people age 50 received least one vaccine dose, according Portuguese government. ages 25 49 95% 12 17 88%. 89% Portugal’s entire population 10 million least one vaccine dose, far behind rate world-leading United Arab Emirates, compared 65% U.S. 73% U.K., according Oxford University’s World Data. 
Portugal averaging six deaths day past month, compared almost 300 peak January. Adjusted population, current rate equates 200 U.S. deaths plunged one two day May June rising 20 July. number new daily recorded infections hospitalizations trending since summer. country averaging 750 new cases day, compared almost 13,000 January. 320 people hospitalized, almost 6,700 peak. 
On Oct. 1, Portugal ditched Covid-containment rules, many ways life Lisbon throwback deepest days pandemic. Hand pumps dispensing disinfectant gel ubiquitous churches still rope seats ensure social distancing even though longer obligatory. Covid-19 certificate required large events masks still mandatory public transportation, schools students 10 older, employees shops, restaurants bars. 
**Portugal dropped coronavirus restrictions Oct. 1.** 
Masks still mandatory Lisbon’s subway public transportation. 
At time, subways full. Lisbon’s fleet rickshaw taxis, known Thai term tuk-tuk, whisk tourists along narrow streets city’s old town. Nightlife pulsates various parts city week, tram lines popular tourists skip stops bursting passengers almost every day finds new massive cruise ship docked harbor. 
Portugal’s cautious return normality, despite vaccination rate envy public-health officials around world, watched possible way forward countries vaccinations inch higher contemplate ditch remaining restrictions. Portuguese approach contrasts U.K.’s, combination fewer vaccinated people almost restrictions led surge infections rising death rate.

 
Soccer stadiums Portugal operate full capacity, spectators must show vaccinated, recently recovered Covid-19 tested negative. 
“I need tourists, otherwise business, look infection numbers every day goes even little bit get nervous,” said Paula Marques, runs souvenir shop Lisbon. “I hope pandemic thing past Portugal, honest still worry little bit happen gets colder.” 
Portugal got first wave pandemic early 2020 relatively unscathed. steep rise cases November last year savage surge January shattered illusion small country tucked away southwest corner Europe could escape worst pandemic. 
At peak January, average 290 people dying day Portugal virus. Adjusted population, equates 9,500 U.S. worst daily average week U.S. never topped 3,500 deaths. 
Maria Mota, executive director Lisbon’s Institute Molecular Medicine, one image indelibly imprinted memory period still makes jittery. Working late one evening lab, window counted 52 ambulances lined outside emergency room country’s largest hospital waiting drop patients. 
Portugal “transitional period” likely delineate pandemic new reality endemic Covid-19, said Dr. Mota. memories trauma January still fresh collective Portuguese memory question marks remaining happen cold returns life resumes indoors, people likely proceed cautiously, said. 
“Nobody ever forget past January, Covid endemic need learn live virus,” said Dr. Mota. “Almost whole population vaccinated virus still circulates, showing won’t go away.” 
As countries large proportion population vaccinated, stubborn persistence infections Portugal hasn’t led significant increase rate hospitalizations deaths. 
“Things getting better, it’s slow,” said Miguel Campos, drives tourists around Lisbon tuk-tuk. “We taking baby steps. mix optimism hope return normal continue.” 
’Things getting better, it’s slow,’ said rickshaw taxi driver Miguel Campos, Covid-19 situation Portugal. 
Paula Marques, owns souvenir shop Lisbon, said business relies tourism worries infections might rise weather gets colder. 
Before pandemic 800 rickshaw taxi drivers Lisbon, 200 work week 500 weekends, said Valentim Gaspar, another rickshaw taxi driver. now, balance drivers tourists makes possible earn decent living, said. 
The Portuguese almost universally attribute vaccination success Henrique Gouveia e Melo, ex-submarine commander brought run inoculation drive shaky start. projected confidence tapped population’s generally favorable attitudes vaccinations, according public-health experts. vaccine rollout began January worst pandemic peaked Portugal, providing clear incentive anybody might unsure getting vaccinated. 
On soccer-mad continent, Portugal stands dedication sport, making return full capacity stadiums symbolic many people. Spain, also one highest vaccination rates Europe, recently returned full capacity stadiums, food still can’t sold. Italy month increased stadium capacity 75% 50%. Germany, still limits capacity. 
“It’s time open everything somebody hasn’t gotten vaccinated point, aren’t going get vaccinated,” said Hugo Vale, 32-year-old engineer, drank beer friends outside stadium ahead Benfica-Bayern game. 
Close 100% people age 50 received least one vaccine dose, according Portuguese government. true. growth rate falling UK cases dropping. Hospitalisations much smaller previous waves. Quite frankly, I'm disinterested swaying point. patience wore ages ago faith humanity/any ability compromise find common ground half population U.S. wore five+ years ago even pandemic. Either get dragged ear along us go insulate bubble somewhere alone/with antivax people hope best. genuinely care either way whatsoever.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* situation 99.9997% stuff accurate 'Can see victim here? thought made quite clear daily rants break-room!' That’s better rich country sharing zero. even paying taxes that. I'm currently staying uncle wife temporarily. previously covid recovered. lived uncle past consider somewhat qualified detect abnormalities him. Previously, memory seemed pretty average. However, seems like never remembers anything. Entire conversations vanish memory within 24 hours. seems memory events went together past. wife's memory even worse his. know ever normal never lived now. uncle 50s wife 40s, ability recall information reminds grandma 80s.

Anyways, I'm worried short term long term memory may permanently damaged result covid. overreacting? know serious, said before. issue making anything mandatory others, want even medically exempt get fired! ur medically exempt ur work. That’s small amount ppl isn’t fair. issue. 

Heck even go far religious exemptions, like orthodox jewish Islam, even drink caffeine, want force them? lose job…. cannot okay that. 

And again, r doctors nurses refusing work front lines, expert r, going try say know do! ur medical professional scientist, u shouldn’t telling do. That’s issue mandates. 

Excluding medically exempt people able work, religious exemptions honest real, isn’t right. choice decide this. r many doctors nurses getting it, worked work front lines still, im arguing w wanting force them.

I swear compassion lost world, someone know real extra safe people condemn still can’t vax waiting get it. 

And judgement others insane anymore. U assume people mandates makes vaccines science. Even say r know bad is! Smh I’m tired childish remarks rudeness others opinion different theirs. 

I literally horrible side effects drugs doctors given me, induced autoimmune hepatitis two hospital stays, serotonin syndrome lost 3 days life zero memory nothing, GBS flu vax hospital stays more…. ppl want need data continuing that, drug companies need prove data never do. 

I lived thru horrors pharmaceutical companies wouldn’t wish enemy. know life experiences, could issues going judge rude want hurt. anyone good person world. thankful son raised better taught empathy others compassion! absolutely mind blowing mean people are! Give time... ""If someone know forced leave job taking vaccine, may entitled compensation! Call Dewey, Cheatham Howe FREE CONSULTATION!"" really makes scratch head wonder refusal protect rest force let alone public. Beyond dumb.  got paid 7 year-old? what. can’t collect unemployment, they’re choosing leave company. rest worlds fucking problem. Nope. USA politics less presence.  Turns forcing people things highly effective... isn't. Mandates actively carve individuals society something mindful of. Dying societies this, cant let expand.  That's funny, I'm vaxxed I'd rather sit home eat beans work. really good head shoulders happened. likely pretty good at/knowledgable one two things. same. fine Good Oh, many this. Well, technically speaking, child, I’m 17. always satisfying see problem solve itself.   hearing totally cool totally legal. burger king said best: way Gotta catch all! That’s good know! Smart policy entire Carrier Strike Group 3700 personnel, clear article many 3,700 personnel part CSG. team meetings, writing care plans, burdened silly company politics dealing shitty coworkers - really relaxed way working. (Depending kind work course.) bleeds leads tenet journalism hundred years least. similar that. stupid people stupid things report instead reasonable people reasonable things. CDC told so

Source? give responsible individual job keep ones working safer. Win win. laughed way hard They'll move states like Florida seen heroes. someone vaccinated struggling find job, theirs? workers represent tiny fraction overall employees, even 1% workplaces. add thousands people many states.

Wait… miss something? people suddenly care *less 1%*? Let'em. dentists recommend toothpaste. time dentist recommend **specific** toothpaste. agree them. also think loose jobs want vaccinated. really isn't. Thankfully doctor's recommendation paid part. Occasional cavity filling every years teeth (except wisdom) remain place. Employee #2 can't make error unless employee #1 also made error. occurrence obviously much lower system relies one user.

And that's good enough, errors make bank fixed banking system. ACH reversals like thing. state kind influence always get money back. vendor return money received error they'll never work state again, worth it. read article can't read.  mean, labor shortage, something like ten million jobs available 7 million unemployed, unemployed may unqualified geographically area jobs they're qualified for, like described may find jobs undesirable number reasons, pay, benefits, work environment, etc. 

The fact labor shortage contributing increased worker power upward pressure wages. Observational anecdotal fast food gas stations around offering anywhere $13-$17 start. wife's office job gave $2/hr raise keep ahead market rate 7 years actually recognize good employees hard find easy keep treated well. 

So shortage, even worse sectors historically abuse under- value workers. Nimitz class aircraft carrier crew 6000. Let’s use 5000 math easy. 2% crew infected. 

Unvaccinated ship: 90%. 

I take 2% 90%. sort person thinks warships capable blowing enemy…not nursing random disease. peaceful know…. Osterholm saying similar things variant, Osterholm doom-and-gloom much Gottlieb. 

The UK testing lot more, likely accounting many cases US. Deaths hospitalizations following cases. variant “variant concern” WHO. It’s media talking point journalists (not scientists) using explain rise UK cases. mean yeah that's true. true January appointment already scheduled. Obviously ease access longer relevant someone shifted really strong stance against. around 1% industries. There's bound crazies society.

And we've seen last 5 years really come fore.  entirely wrong Delta prediction made statement July 28th. Maybe week off. virus peaked south mid-August, September cases downtrend country whole.

I guess depends define wave over, peak Delta clearly Mid late August wave crescenting early September. prediction really there. see would think that. However, must resident Chicago Chicago PD.  Weed .. thos people get actually meant losing job.   offense, statement background biochemistry sounds like lie least extremely exaggerated reading rest comment. really wish we’d stop acting like thousands lot. Yes. That’s kind thinking asked. rounding error magnitude 100 1,000 Okay guess one promised could anything wanted.

Society somewhat normal vaccinated vaccine.

The goal prevent another shutdown prevent loss life.

If unvaccinated whatever reason expect treated like toddler forever. No, even large. You’d call 100K-900K rounding error, you’d report significant number millions. amount isn’t even rounding error. Bunch lazy people looking reason work. Honestly, always overrated restaurant anyways. popular image lack nationwide availability. menu boring nothing worth writing home about. Yes, fully aware secret menu.

Even chains like burger king, mcdonalds, carls jr better burgers menus. friend mine texted said sick weekend flu-like symptoms, starting Friday night.

I physically around mainly outside walk children school together. last time indoors last Monday morning went breakfast together. fully vaxxed (both COVID flu) one house high risk.

I symptoms sickness. concerned time? get saying mean moment knew obese people heavily effected say like year+ ago promoted losing weight. also agree good idea, loose weight say 1000 less calories yes unhealthy. eating well balanced diet eating 200 calories less TDEE, losing weight healthily immune system thank it.  Trust me, misinformation exists readily. I’m PR, currently mainland US. entire family still PR. got vaccine back March. mom got vaccinated sister kept asking going (she chronic asthma, concerned). dad kept refusing. know got jab? got covid past September vaccinated kept hospital. dad acknowledged Covid real problem. “the government lying” types arguments. I'm lawyer, but... yes can. hope sell stuff counter gallon. Fill swamp coolers it. Fill pepper/bear sprayers it. Heck, get fleet B-52s blanket country chemtrails. 

Again, I'm lawyer.   ever heard technological safeguards? Lmao genius stuff here. Relax. employee 2 though? still human, thus errors caused regardless many view it. example, advertisements/books etc. can’t tell many times see errors type stuff Supposed edited editors. zero covid-forever mask people pushing ever since CDC recommended fully vaccinated people mask again.

The really trust vaccines all...only mask wearing (the type quality mask matter them).  Package like pepper spray?   ""Medical Privacy Freedom + Choice All""

I assume one way Texas stand women's reproductive rights... right? '' THOUSANDS '' think HUNDREDS THOUSANDS died.  Comparing child would disservice children everywhere.  That's I'm wondering. I've reading reports rising case counts UK Delta+ also Russia. (Although Russia poor vaccination stats, think case increases precipitous maybe discounted. lot people, experts even, made mistake Delta wild type India proved nasty strain presented huge challenges even highly-vaccinated nations.) also use word ""*prevent*"" instead ""reduce"". absolute ironclad insistence made vaccines reduce transmission puzzling say least.

Not puzzling all. Informed choice finding facts make better decisions, motivated reasoning finding factoids justify choices already made. long think terms latter, makes perfect sense. Ok, that’s decision. society won’t fund unemployment. It’s fault. miscarriage likely due undiagnosed type 2 diabetes learned accept cannot know everything…. midwife told me, healthy babies tend survive. It’s ones genetic issues don’t know tend one time miscarriages, big difference HMS Queen Elizabeth 100% vaccination 100 700 infected 14% versus 92% infected unvaccinated ship population. Addition subtraction article said 1900 people among Washington state government employees. Let's super rough extrapolation single data point. Washington's state government employs 119,000 people. 1900/119,000 1.6%. 1.6% 150,000,000 2.4million people. still relatively small number, could even considered rounding error, ""A couple thousand"" gross misrepresentation probable number people leaving jobs vaccine reasons.  bacteria Lysol kill? *Don't let door hit way out! let it...whatever...just long Melcer originally opposed Covid vaccine.

Then, says, God came kept telling me, 'Don't take it. take it.' said, 'Really?' kept questioning it, kept coming back with, 'Yeah, take it,'"" says.

God, prankster! questions maybe someone help.

I keep seeing figure cited AY.4.2 ""only"" 10- 15% infectious Delta cause major disruptions. However, feel like I'm missing something.

Because contagious Delta, *ceteris parabus* would expected cause disruption, since (1) lot people Delta yet burn (2) cohort recovered original Delta (or immunized) inefficient immune response sublineage different enough wild type Delta virus overcome immune defenses. 

With lot smart people confident issue, feel must missing something, would like know understand better. minus fever plus nausea. 

All seem bit lesser severity. Ehhh. 7-8/10 depending long recovery time is. 25 hours better, still pretty rough.

And thanks! stupid fucks seem forgotten **mandatory** vaccines get allowed go school. Ok going go watch old ST movies again.   thought obvious…. Since know, forever due success vaccines 😔 think person responded misunderstood wrote lol point employee unduly punished simple manual entry error, manual entry error cause big loss system used built account that.

Dr. Greg pediatrician I'm going record saying allowing kids freely infected novel disease unknown long term consequences worst idea 2021 despite pretty crowded field far

(July 2 2021 Twitter) Apparently still get booster soon recover wear masks university, great success. Everyone complies, cases numbers never took nearly 0 now. would question you?  I'll getting moderna abroad... Previously J&amp;J, saying different? recall seeing charts showing decreases gradual, sharp drop-off point. make less obvious exactly booster appropriate. front line worker? so, definitely eligible. thing trump boat parades!! thought 1000 people boats would win it. Hello assholes, there's MILLIONS MILLIONS folks can't even dream buying boat. people win over, assholes buy boats 5 motors back!   Moderna booster still higher dose mRNA Pfizer?

There’s nothing vax card that’s useful scammers. booster wrecked worse second shot. Pfizer.. know poor top cause death world? logic help people get poverty either. Yeah, survivors doses indeed less likely die compared unvaccinated. Why? dose 1 14 days past dose 2 weak unhealthy purged vaccines.

Getting Pfizer booster Monday Walgreens, J&amp;J April also covid August lol. Hopefully I’m good go now. read Time magazine. Moderna going preference (J&amp;J recipient originally), opting go Pfizer since it’s full dose. also covid back August hopefully I’m set now. Good Pfizer There’s also 100% chance false negative get test day get infected. Normally people start develop symptoms four five days exposed, test positive around time. I’m sure contagious early stages infection viral loads low detected PCR test, it’s nonzero rate.

That's one K417N mutation, whereas *new* Delta Plus mutations A222V Y145H. really hope so. really want daughter able get it. sooner better!  Knowing Adobe, workers probably can't afford subscription fee 3rd shot referred “booster” shot 0.25ml rather 0.5ml? 
good bad example? - car gas tank 1/3 tank left fill up, considered “booster” even tank capacity every time fill up? anyone tried getting 4th shot Moderna yet already got 3rd shot immunocompromised? Wow hey might offered pizza party stay activate 5g chip first Curious reactions! J&amp;J super sick like 2 days. Trying decide booster. I’m thinking moderna scared get sick would hysterical actually vaccinated can’t tell anyone bullshit they’ve spewing. sure he’s actually Florida?

Exactly. main problem ain't government, since donations backup image ""good willing countries"" would dumb decide donate, ones slowing actions pharmaceutical companies behind vaccines, guys create complicated conditions people get vaccines free.  That’s true. 

The Moderna dosage adults. doesn’t matter person underlying health conditions, getting booster. Oh look, job creator.  Since article German, change Spring 2022? Sounds like one think so, nothing new communicated awhile. remember originally projected September FDA approval 5-11 group, said 5 could get Christmas.

Exactly I’m unclear getting idea, anything it’s opposite       studies showing mild presentation disease correlates long-covid symptoms recovery. Vaccines cause disease milder symptoms... ergo... there's sufficient evidence 20 year old getting booster poorer countries barely vaccinated all. giraffes? Thank you. Clickbait title smh.    get paid suspension killing unarmed civilian get paid disclose vaccination status? Checks out. they're placed unpaid leave and/or fired, that's what. think shut coworker who's telling everyone within earshot natural immunity better vaccine.  

He probably hear fit knows. comment. Please mindlessly linked studies like these. Number one RCT admits within first paragraph. know may particular opinion topic, grateful provided papers, however poster case ask randomly controlled trials mask wearing among general population. 

Number 2 literally cautions cloth masks HCW's. Since motivation study personal protection.

Number 3, literally admits due lack RCT's inconclusive results however 'supportive' evidence. 

The guy asked RCTs, give RCTs instead calling troll say 'there RCTs - studies'  Pfizer boosted 4 hours ago baby! Hoping shot grows tail!  think accept people die covid. accept people die causes. change long covid going anywhere. agree them. Though call insanity. Producing distributing vaccines every single eligible human already monumental task overcoming less perfectly. perpetual way feasible. takes resources. takes reallocation logistics. prior experience something like this. Vaccination runs either smaller scale shorter time area low risk delta one predict one interacting carrier low risk area?

I've seen people weddings. yeah, people probably going commit identity theft friends. guess suspicious event refuses check vaccination status door insists online. Can’t fix that. I’m saying gonna screw lot people over. don’t really care tho it’s employees market 60 employees getting vaccinated like supposed to? much misinformation brainwashing perhaps?  Who’s gonna cover 60 employees then? Great job too! *Similarly, percentage fully vaccinated people died Covid-19 almost doubled 24.3% deaths (61 251) 11 September 43.3% deaths (174 402) 16 October.* 
 
*In words, 11 September 16 October, 29 unvaccinated people died Covid-19 compared 149 people received least one dose (including 113 fully vaccinated people).*

No matter spin it...this hoped for. I'm definitely anti-vax (vaxxed since April), latest data troubling. antivaxxer. 

But Australia literally coerced get vaccine we've docile it. Government literally made compulsory 65% eligible population, made compulsory name rest via vaccine passport plus measures.

For example state queensland literally COVID-zero. Guess letting anyone without double dose attend venues even cases. 

There's protests Australia regarding COVID vaccine apart isolated events quickly shut one hour. 

That explains high vaccination rate. Yep..great point! disgusting. I’ve show ID plus excelsior pass. sure require international travelers. Exactly...they idiot Science Deniers bad: big bad crybabies can't told do, many people become cops. someone UK NYC right now, flash anything name get 95% places, conform standard. one recognised EU Covid PDF looked 5 seconds like fine.

Woo! far booster less symptoms dose 2 (at 9 hours far). Anybody know guy’s actual business is? mean deal card?s [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Catanzara POS. thought guy bad, that's like comparing car crash train wreck.  feel that.

Obviously know Walgreens same. Yes, also remember quite people long, drawn hospital stays die. Meaning ""within 28 days testing positive"" also misses lot deaths. blaming Russia misinformation Covid?  Catanzara POS. thought guy bad, that's like comparing car crash train wreck.  Well, _I_ blame title, since use title obviously clickbait, going downvotes. Personally bothered posting it. Oh, absolutely still going get booster. care evidence shows need booster every 6 months, every 6 weeks every 6 days (obviously little hyperbolic here). Booster hell up. 

I doubt comparatively mild symptoms far thanks getting vaccinated. reason took long get covid vaccine (it's great someone covid coughs face wear mask). I'm healthcare, see exactly bad virus get routine basis. wish nursing. guys still lot, work hard, without sooooo much bs deal Thank sharing this. kids 3 5, quarantined twice since school started August.

Background Objectives 
The suspicion population stressor profound COVID-19 pandemic would increase preterm birth among cohorts gestation outset supported data collected 2020. evolutionary perspective circumstance suggests natural selection utero, induced onset pandemic, caused pregnancies would otherwise produced preterm birth end early gestation spontaneous abortions. test possibility using odds live-born twin among male births Norway indicator depth selection birth cohorts. 
 
Methodology 
We apply Box-Jenkins methods 50 pre-pandemic months estimate counterfactuals 9 birth cohorts gestation March 2020 first deaths attributable SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred Norway. use Alwan Roberts outlier detection methods discover sequence outlying values odds live-born twin among male births exposed birth cohorts. 
 
Results 
We find downward level shift 27% monthly odds twin among male births beginning May persisting remainder 2020. 
 
Conclusions 
and Implications: Consistent evolutionary theory selection utero, birth cohorts exposed utero onset COVID-19 pandemic yielded fewer male twins expected.

""Yeah looking percentage deaths vaxed vs unvaxed loses context many total deaths happening, overall going lower vax rate higher, vaxed/unvaxed percentage split increasingly tilting towards vaxed side even absolute number deaths goes down.

Like, say average vaxed person 0.005% chance dying covid given month, non-vaxxed person 0.02% chance.

At 50% vax rate, we'd expect, country 9 million people, 4.5mil * 0.00005 = 225 vaxed deaths 4.5mil * 0.0002 = 900 unvaxed deaths, total deaths = 900+225=1125, 20% vaxed people 80% unvaxed people.

At 90% vax rate, we'd expect vax deaths = (9mil * 0.9)*0.00005 = 405 vaxed deaths, (9min * 0.1)*0.002 = 180 unvaxed deaths = 585 total deaths, 70% vaxed 30% unvaxed.

So higher vax rate less total deaths, deaths higher proportion vaccinated population, point overall population vaccinated.""

However inside Amazon role actually supposed pay range $175k-225k since needed hire wine dined offered highest amount level employee next target probably gonna closer $175k already making first 4 years gonna pretty much get raises despite real market value (what companies offer external hires) increasing due experience. 4 years still promoted, pay gonna go $175k.

In company like Google that's generous employees (although seems changing recent remote working policies), actually get additional stock grants every year increase total annual compensation depending performance. 1 year job might get another grant worth $60k vesting 4 years, every year.

Plenty people locked good jobs due good ol boy network long. Time change guard. idea well. People downvoting reason.

In research papers comparison half dose vs full dose - seem duration durability antibody response seem considerably less full dose.

So unreasonable suppose Moderna half dose vs Pfizer full dose would result Pfizer win. I'm hour half north you, imagine right. gets much crazier happy they're going, knows basic health safety measures believe in, I'd prefer find out. rather part worldwide viral study without compensation supposedly going retire 6 years. god told take vaccine. can’t find work….boo hoo. r/QAnonCasualties

Without restrictions large gatherings possible hospitals become overwhelmed can’t deal stress.  guess lazy don’t want work It’s also company systems place don’t protect manual error. agree you, think there's also stronger possibility people decide get vaccinated know job waiting them. think better Adobe employ extraneous idiots means people get vaccinated. doubt jobs waiting forever, truly stubborn among lose jobs eventually either way. matter time.

However, initial post reduced twisted something could use argument socialized healthcare. Well, even argument. strawman really: ""This country socialized healthcare bad things, therefore socialized healthcare bad"". make mandatory vaccine collect unemployment too. still understand fully determine came lab. 

Are talking hypothetically? think anyone claimed that, sources far likely.  dumb instead dom, yeah   blame vaccinated people kind misinformation, least certain degree 

For months, vaccinated people telling people “you still catch spread won’t go hospital die”

Not even hint statement also says “it also reduces transmission lot reduces chance catch covid lot.” 

The thing harp “not hospitalized” doesn’t counter anti vaccination argument “if still catch spread what’s point” 

People got start changing messaging 

Including experts, public figures  already known covid death rate underreported US, states thought underreported 40%. necessarily intentional underreporting, counting covid deaths accurately takes time daily reports tend counts. don’t understand subset population latched Ivermectin.

The people put hopes Ivermectin know presented horse dewormer many media companies, despite used human treatment decades.

No. Thousands SAY would rather lose jobs. fact actually comes tiny fraction keep word. end getting vaccinated turns can’t find work opposition vaccine total nonsense credible medical authority endorses. absolute ironclad insistence made vaccines reduce transmission puzzling say least.

Sorry nobody wants jobs. Whereas places like work would probably ton applicants, despite losing TON people since pandemic started, cutting management last 5 years replacements nobody actually approve half transactions need do, business better last decade... We're hiring anyone. cuz. Idk much work maybe. even people leaving overworked 6 people's jobs, still filling gaps, mess. many people take jobs.

I hope legitimate businesses actually hiring, even bigger problems soon ""labor shortage"" bs. Oh. ok. edited answer. Got two crew. One would really missed one best workers I've ever worked TBH. other... would probably benefit long term brain damage covid.  fair think it’s forced vaccinated good news ""Delta Plus"" labeled variant concern found contagious Delta. thing Delta burned huge chunk population US. Combine increased vaccinations kids vaccinated soon helps immunity. We'll wait see happens winter though. I'm assuming many vaccinated tetanus, probably polio too.

I still wonder vaccine.  Confirmation Bias Jesus. ""Transparent aluminum!""

It also fed ""leaky vaccine"" narrative anti-vaxxers ""researching"" poultry viruses like Marek's disease. running Wuhan marathon. Thousands &lt; Millions believe we'll fine. So, invented perfect protection manual errors. must intelligent, accomplished, rich person.

Or random critter internet, clear.  It’s proven negative headlines garner attention clicks. say, bleeds leads. Media caters people consumption habits. reason people think vaccines don’t stop transmission CDC told needed create justification indefinite masking everybody. worked.

Obviously, isn’t true. someone explain narrative people following think millions people die vaccines 3 years? end times garbage? Real data? That’s available year, reported weekly. That’s excuse.

I’m unclear restrictions mean. mean restrictions unvaccinated?

If that’s question answer probably “effectively never”.

If unvaccinated probably forever second class citizen.

The relative normalcy vaccinated enjoy privilege done necessary. Yes, know age boomers--right 56 76, though definitions slightly different. 

According CDC data tracker link, page 3 (which show ages) October 24, 2021: 

age 74+ 81.7% fully vaccinated 
age 65-74 87% fully vaccinated  
age 50-64 74.9% fully vaccinated 
Under 50 percentage group declines age.

Given boomers groups least 74.9% vaccination rate, group made entirely boomers (age 65-74) highest rate, understand trying say.  persuade vaccines don’t reduce transmission, justify absolutely personal choice affects alone. moment admit reduce transmission, understand choices affect others.

Bingo. 

Then add nuttiness ""vaccinated people spread more!"" complete weird stuff ""vaccine shedding"" (which mainly thing live virus vaccines used -- mRNA COVID vaccines use virus all) feel like part protect us!

They think benefits vaccine outweigh risks kids age 18.

(I know article specifically 5-11 year olds though) superpowers don’t forget Anti-vaxxer claims misleading? Shocked tell you…….. Ya know people still died starvation poor Covid?

This terrible argument. Regardless whether hunger kills less, covid still killed millions date worldwide 700k US alone.

Unlike world hunger, costs nothing individual level get vaccine (outside fraction dollar personal taxes already went funding it), everyone eligible so, covid deaths US would drop nearly 0.

And arguing that, something else happens cause deaths, obligation end different cause death even though 1) within power 2) costs virtually nothing.

The ""real"" cost getting vaccine people's social &amp; political cred. Put seatbelt take off, get plane. Probably trolling? unfortunate inequality healthcare worldwide something I, citizen US, responsible for. 


However, inhabitant world, part wasting millions vaccines available many fellow countryfolks refuse take also part protecting family community. airplane seatbelt?

Well okay that's decision. certain leader certain party tried hide behind half million body bags, didn’t work well. they're vaccinated then; pretty fucking obvious. double causes combined, 66% died COVID. withholding boosters way meaningfully change supply around developing world.

How so? Asking entire argument depending assumption Measuring accurately 1/3 volume already small shot difficult enough justify changes. Given frenzy I'm seeing among parents kids age, enough right away. I'm sorry family high-risk, they're vaccinated + boosted, risk going change charade distancing masking ""a weeks.""

I’ve noticed one biggest issues last two years, people assuming know someone feels asking explain it. get downvoted yelled someone little sensitive pandemic, arguments start people get rude mean one another. 

It okay admit understand everything world, want too, ask lot questions, lol! school many years ago still today. understand someone saying simply ask elaborate. constantly see people (esp here) immediately assume know person means never actually read said. communicate differently, trying say anything makes sense everyone equally impossible!

Hospitalizations always important metric, except part lags considerably behind cases (which already lag considerably behind infections).

England 100% normal, vaccine passes, masks, rules, nothing. Scandinavia I've heard. Thank both! Covid deniers use individual stories get sympathy i.e. son friend's hairdresser got vaccinated complications maybe people believe vaccines same.

I tell people fully vaccinated niece catch Covid fully vaccinated asymptomatic friend actually vaccinated.  might symptoms also False negative (much less so) False Positive tests. Couldn’t said better myself. seems logic get thrown window keep boot pressed opposition. fuck. case. living completely different pandemic Yep. point, masking, etc. protect anti-vaxxers. Fuck that. One probably asymptomatic Same, wife got vaccinated February. time ton research available vaccine pregnant woman doctor said negative side effects covid pregnant already well known life threatening all. Seemed like brainer us.

Our second daughter born healthy July well. 2nd shot put butt 12 hours 1 hour middle night chills. yeah way better 2nd. It’s 30 hours I’m fine. Yeah looked totally awesome making empty promises lungs failed covid completely intubation option, odds survival terrible

What kind percentages talking hospital? not. wife (46) (50) got morning Publix.

Arm little sore hours ,bit now.
When got 2nd shot wiped days, wife problems all.  Currently sitting walgreens waiting one. year half COVID-19 pandemic three vaccines available US, seems like everyone knows someone—or least heard someone—who's vaccinated diagnosed virus thereafter. come surprise many people wondering whether shot still job. 


 
Enter, SARS-CoV-2 antibody blood tests, detect infection-fighting proteins linger immune system beats COVID-19, revs response vaccination. tests actually gauge whether COVID-19 immunity? 


 
Turns antibody tests definitively recommended determine whether protected COVID-19, according US Food Drug Administration (FDA). experts see great value commercial tests prescribed reasons (i.e., find whether COVID-19). Here's need know antibody tests COVID-19, (if anyone) get antibody test. That's happen lap bullshit spoon fed groups interested fueling foolish division fighting virus. theory, testing positive spike protein antibodies mean vaccine working, positive nucleocapside antibody test confirm COVID-19. But—and big but—the jury many antibodies need immunity, long immunity might last, according FDA. What's more: ""We know whether antibodies protect various COVID-19 strains circulation,"" Dr. Cheryl G. Healton, DrPH, dean School Global Public Health New York University, tells Health. ""So there's much value antibody testing."" 


 
Dr. Schaffner—and majority infectious disease colleagues—agree: ""In medical school, we're taught never test unless know going positive negative result,"" tells Health. ""In case antibody testing, results can't interpreted, recommend all."" another reddit user u/kevin2357
 
""Yeah looking percentage deaths vaxed vs unvaxed loses context many total deaths happening, overall going lower vax rate higher, vaxed/unvaxed percentage split increasingly tilting towards vaxed side even absolute number deaths goes down.

Like, say average vaxed person 0.005% chance dying covid given month, non-vaxxed person 0.02% chance.

At 50% vax rate, we'd expect, country 9 million people, 4.5mil * 0.00005 = 225 vaxed deaths 4.5mil * 0.0002 = 900 unvaxed deaths, total deaths = 900+225=1125, 20% vaxed people 80% unvaxed people.

At 90% vax rate, we'd expect vax deaths = (9mil * 0.9)*0.00005 = 405 vaxed deaths, (9min * 0.1)*0.002 = 180 unvaxed deaths = 585 total deaths, 70% vaxed 30% unvaxed.

So higher vax rate less total deaths, deaths higher proportion vaccinated population, point overall population vaccinated.""

For last time vaccine 100% effective stopping covid deaths vaccine 100% effective. vaccine stop covid deaths significantly reduce number deaths. Ireland around 90% takeup adults adults always going highest risk dying especially elderly since teens kids low risk dying. Also lower vaccine rate poorer communities, death rates generally higher anyway. English monopoly misinformation. anything, propaganda targeted toward immigrant communities US (not applicable Puerto Rico course) skewed social media platforms make even less effort correct non-English language falsehoods. They’ve also vaccine mandate since August, gave businesses week implement it. Religious exemptions require supporting documentation religious leader. don’t mess around there. Hospitals losing money? Oh no!

The COVID-19 pandemic complex impact romantic relationships their

and various communication technologies even before. addition, especially 
among younger individuals, reevaluation current relationships seems be 
more important pandemic. quality relationship took hits

variables account differences. Although parents feel additional burden, 
this might felt problematic. However, trying legally end their 
marriage confronted additional problems. One crucial negative outcome the 
increase rates intimate partner violence solution issue easily

they also use video-chatting teletherapy stay touch clients. 
 
Despite impressive number studies conducted romantic relationships  
during pandemic, shortcomings must discussed. studies only

between different stages COVID-19 pandemic (the start pandemic, the

""Men much likely die COVID-19 women. true globally – death rate 50% higher men. Notably, gap appear explained either differences number confirmed cases pre-existing conditions.""
 
The virus known impact men more, else equal. course top comment casual misandry though. average antivaxxer also 42 year old woman.

Stupidity bigger problem pandemic itself. Unfortunately experience. used years ago. one year went flu shot. know me, could lift arm 6"" body several weeks. took full year regain full mobility arm. pain, literally could lift it.

I back shot since, want wait booster better judgment, went. 🤷‍♀️

Still glad got it, even Michael Myers giving me. literally virus that's known impact men else equal, furthermore they're overrepresented labor supply type jobs never able pause long. 
 
Would interest know average antivaxxer 42 year old woman. go ahead casual misandry. 
 Good  agree call mockdowns here. certainly change view Korea never lockdown. 

Also true lockdowns rare. used much EU, especially Ireland, Italy, Portugal Spain. also used widely Asia, especially Vietnam India.

People get vaccines probably also likely follow medical advice less likely die preventable causes. ABSTRACT 
Background 
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) dramatic effects pregnant population worldwide, increasing risk adverse perinatal outcomes. 
 
Objective 
To assess incidence aSB COVID-19 pandemic Austria. 
 
Methods 
We collected epidemiological data Austrian Birth Registry compared rate aSB (i.e., fetal death ≥24+0 gestational weeks) pandemic period (March–December 2020) respective pre-pandemic months (2015–2019). 
 
Results 
In total, 65 660 pregnancies included, 171 resulted aSB 33.7±4.8 gestational weeks. pandemic, aSB increased 2.49 2.60‰ (p=0.601), opposing significant decline preterm deliveries ≤37 gestational weeks 0.61 0.56‰ (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.96; p&lt;0.001). first lockdown, aSB rate significantly increased 2.38 3.52‰ (p=0.021), yielding aOR 1.57 (95% CI 1.08, 2.27; p=0.018). event aSB COVID-19 pandemic strongly related increased fetal weight, maternal obesity. 
 
Conclusion 
In Austria, overall increase incidence aSB pandemic significant peak first lockdown.  3% reduction pay vs inflation... nice    hate articles like stress negative. real story rates almost 100% people get vaccinated mandates.

Well, you’ve got wish. Nobody making get vaccine. limited options employment.  Kind like immuno-comprised people feel stay home safe. There's lot people say actually hold up. Chicago police supposedly huge number push came shove saw 21 unpaid leave. days likely half get shot, take another job department requirement, take retirement already eligible for.  that’s get UBI approved. everybody would suffering cognitive impairment, infected Covid. Also, I'm sure agree life quarantine less cognitively stimulating, even less social (just creative socializing zoom, etc).  I'm hoping people qualify unemployment. want tax dollars going support them. don’t understand subset population latched Ivermectin. mean, want “miracle cure” Covid much anyone, ain’t it. ever going find actual cure many researchers tied debunking snake oil junk science? think would possible create vaccines group coronaviruses, together could amount universal coverage? likely underreported like countries. excess deaths article economist recently eye opening. it, tried twice! options exhausted. guess quit job now. /s    Thousands people morons.

Many anti vaccine hesitant wanted children point soon confident data regarding that. clear, co workers idiots; they're people I've seen think critically life death situations times count. convinced data seeing. 

Some them, ones work closely doctors, changed stance got vaccinated long talks them, think every corporation fucking right now: They're forcing mandating vaccines without making good faith effort understand people reluctant. think mandate would beneficial line, first employees sit meeting actual physician allow concerns addressed answered. 

And come ""well there's paper paper studies and-"" yes, get that. are. know read them, say. know read them. probably really really good recognizing bad arguments understanding qualifies credible source case. get that.

Also, termination cause eligible unemployment benefits. even ask ...  I'm expert, hypothesis. think general, places around world good vaccine availability poor uptake (and authorities either slow unwilling force vaccine take voluntarily), explanation boils one factors: (1) Conservatism, political fear new unfamiliar. (2) Defiance. people simply like told do, even lives stake. really like told people like--in case ""liberals"" scientific experts. distrust things, and, again, willing bet lives it. (3) Misinformation. easy manipulate people's behavior right timing techniques. (4) Stupidity. good number people actually stupid make spectacularly poor decisions. uncomfortable acknowledge this, find everywhere, factor here, too. Finally, (5) Overconfidence. defensive mechanism, people refuse believe real could happen them... late. Put together, places slow uptake getting hit hard. tragic, surprising. Yep. contracts extremely high paid traveler nurses also short durations. make less 180 day contracts ones making $200/hr 3 week contracts. basically fill gaps longer term contracts.
