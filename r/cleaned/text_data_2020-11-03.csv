Still arguing could wear shut up.  


And live Melbourne, Australia. know, place world right finishing successful lockdown reporting 0 cases. children unlikely spread virus ‚Äî **but older kids risk, say researchers.**

The subtitle alone tells sort cherry picking underplaying way omission.

Look, research also shows children catch virus shed viral particles, older children likely young kids pass others. United States, community transmission remained high many places schools started reopen August, proportion infections children continued climb, says Ashlesha Kaushik, paediatrician Sioux City, Iowa, spokesperson American Academy Pediatrics. Basically public wearing mask.

No not. Sounds like someone contacted OSHA sooner would come sooner. doubt OSHA analyzes death records anomalies connected workplaces order respond proactively. take away this, article October 7th. stupid enough follow them. stupid enough die. not. Disproved multiple times. Multiple tropical climates massive problems virus May June July hot impact temperature people's activity, people outdoors music festivals family barbecues still spreading literally talking bullshit disproved early April. might want try updating info. embarrassingly date.

Can link sources? never mentioned virus would gone tropical climate. ive read Corona Virus longer ""life expectancy"" outside host cold dry climate hot moist. night day propably major difference peoples behavior, completly neglectable either. course many tropical countries still major troubles. look jakarta, even virus would die quick outside human body, people cramped bad hygiene, doesnt matter much.

If post sources say neglectable, even nonexistent, may accept embarresment. means even impressive Victoria managed get cases control winter. seasons matter, Europe could easily copied Australia got better results thanks season. Except didn't, explanation Europe preferred go Spain holiday get virus control.

Well say **easily** easy lol. ive heard, Victoria really strict harsh lockdown rules implemented cases high (not high european countries currently is). started pandemic beginning winter acted quickly atleas quicker western countries. summer europe population startet believe less less need measures Corona, politician trying tighten rules cases low would little chance. current roaring infections europe mainly community transmission, though propably returning tourists propably kickstarted lots it. Think like seatbelt car empty road.. still put damn thing hardly inconvenient smart/safe thing do.

This stupid analogy I'm sick seeing it. Yes, wear seatbelt empty road, protect *myself* event accident. exactly protecting wearing mask empty road one else around? special country correct. great experiment freedom.  limited hours due covid.

Main drivers : everyone back school work (bosses notoriously anti work home bs), public transportation, cold weather since late August people giving fuck (main reason imo)

Mask use high especially since july made compulsory indoors city centers (walking street, 95% compliance still lot dicknoses hanging out).

Well we're lockdown lite. There's huge debate going essentiel businesses factories remain opened. bookshop close Book aisle Carrefour remains opened (they close non food aisles wednesday think) ? usually pr√©sented anti lockdown argument. sudden people pissed can't buy flowers anymore something regularly smh.

My landlord came unannounced Yesterday check meters (idk needed that) without wearing mask (still half asleep register after) saying shit like that! get word ""confinement""? Keep mind elderly mother retirement home still allowed visit

So yeah... Whatever heard french, we're community oriented, biggest NIMBYs Europe, people stop caring slightly inconvenienced... thought Americans science-denying anti-masker Trumpettes! please provide link CDC declaring 0.1% IFR US?

...oh wait, we‚Äôre ending lockdown life‚Äôs going back normal? Huh. Wait, old polls said thing? There's difference seasons ""the weather"". think oldest people studies 55. Correct I'm wrong. currently, new Digimon series. Duh. forgot mine home gf gave look has, told I've fucked thrilled driving back home. running rotation 4 car, 2 hers(for me) 2 door. single country ""eradicated covid"" kind statement that? Last time checked, 1 POTUS. ‚Äúmore Americans‚Äù means least two. Sure, two Americans approve - hardly significant. studies since AZ think Moderna (possibly others) showing immune response elderly people still strong. Obviously still waiting efficacy results. think thinking kn95s big issue? yes go masks4all we've vetted stuff recommend. presented objective data along double-downed stupid analysis. I'm trolling, dumb. Locally can‚Äôt complain. Overall serious enforcement every imaginable precaution place. Handles even wrapped copper possible help.

On mask thing I‚Äôve driven store, gotten vehicle, gotten entrance realize didn‚Äôt mask. go back vehicle find isn‚Äôt one there. live AZ get tossed dash normally. heat sun sanitize. gf takes wash doesn‚Äôt tell drive back home again. I'll keep eye out.

3M also makes combination organic vapor/P100 cartridge expensive probably available healthcare workers wouldnt using it. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted stating Fauci others said. honestly it‚Äôs difficult wear mask, course certain people stubborn. Geneva, Coupe de No√´l Christmas swim Lake Geneva held annually since 1934, almost 2500 participants recently, many costumes.

Looking examples, it‚Äôs pretty clear mean ‚Äúrisk analysis‚Äù rather referring ‚Äúdecision‚Äù sense autonomy. Wanting entity trust make analysis reasonable. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll blindly agree every mandate given. instance, ALWAYS buckle seatbelt, actually disagree exceptions mask rule. Don‚Äôt fall slippery slope arguments. Boss German ICU association went media demanded switch hospitals emergency mode... This.

Your wrong 
In France needed papers go grocery shopping, look Victoria Australia would months years Yes nailed head. People \*gasp\* get sick. 


Some get sick die. 


Congratulations took bout year figure can't save everyone people die. 


Even people die lockdown though. 


Welcome understanding live fairy tale.  


Blame China learn think one dimension. care anymore. I've best since start pandemic people think I'm crazy idiot care. even know since wear mask times outside. go crazy overly cautious person another maskless face crowd. hate pull mask pull back up. wear done it. Thanks link.


I teach high school CA. hybrid live stream. district made huge push get back classroom think through. Tons kids already switched go back full online instruction (shocker) ton safety protocols everyone follow. back three weeks two COVID cases. imagine Halloween falling Saturday night, we‚Äôll cases next week. 


The real frustrating bit that, like teachers article, we‚Äôll get blamed. union this! It‚Äôs teachers don‚Äôt want work! funny thing is, spoke school board explained version hybrid model would cause 40% reduction educational minutes (personal interaction teachers students). proposed better model would give kids time us. blew off. never ceases amaze people entrust us children, say, ‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs bad policy; hurt kids teachers wastes money,‚Äù people call us greedy union hacks. Ridiculous. Yes first lock-down recorded thousands deaths lock-down, people running about, would hundreds thousands. Available nearly time soon.   masks already useless bc meant worn once. fact moisture extended use increases infection chances. CDC Fauci even said this, recommended using mask, ofc realized much money fear makes. Till 2021 summer??? Lol that's interesting. I'm sure activity too. Since hormonal shifts associated menstrual cycle think rule out. really know started getting fever. guidelines temp checks seem really random me. never know going happen. could fever yesterday know put group chat started talking contact tracer co-worker's situation. \*shrug?\*  Lol vaccine always supposed take like 18 months. Trump like that. There's election thing wants win. starts promising sooner.

Everyone wants vaccine. one wants vaccine potentially deadly disease. Quite opposite happening Medicare paying 2.5x payouts covid related hospitalizations l covid patient administered pneumonia paying hospitals 13k 39k go ventilator.

*States*, hospitals. Certain states downplaying infections deaths going hospital statistics expert opinion since beginning. think people lying virus months telling truth beyond me.

I care botched calculations pretending like every unreported case COVID ended long term consequences could vastly underestimate casualties, care hundreds thousands people died preventable illness people making decisions based BS continually spewing policy people desire based BS would kill millions. Oh grow utter bedwetter it‚Äôs hypothetical situation happens minority cases literally statistical outlier 0.0001% cases it‚Äôs Darwin‚Äôs theory 

Look people upvote even though don‚Äôt understand science yourself. 
Why don‚Äôt post evidence- said true India‚Äôs birthrate drop
To 0 next year finally block someone replies old (Florida stats) post mine every week comment something like: ‚Äúsee, Florida fine, hate fear mongering!‚Äù ‚ÄúYup Florida still fine‚Äù ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs Florida still fine‚Äù.

I guess headline one article really bothered them. dust mask replaceable filters. Two exhalation valves. good going public, still great yard. 

I can't find pack p100 life me.  Oh really, take poll? anything try things beginning botched it. someone credential huge disappointment idea doing. ADA allows businesse/buildings exclude people risk due ongoing health crisis.

Got legit card? Good. Stay outside. ask something? going subreddit? It‚Äôs Coronavirus tons people comments downplaying virus making excuses wear mask? Jesus get grip man, wtf  Good point. Thanks. I'm currently Seoul, Korea. government well controlling pandemic overall. Schools also monitored really closely. Unfortunately, foreigner, know guidelines companies would any. two positive things live England broadly agree opinion happened here. I'm close enough United States give opinion.

Our government made critical mistakes exacerbated spread virus, certainly done malice. strange watch Conservative government, traditionally anti-intervention, wrangle Labour leaders North, traditionally pro-intervention; restrictions Conservative government trying impose Northern Labour leaders fighting against.

We lot people want accept responsibility role containing spread following simple, basic guidelines made loud clear. They'd rather blame government everything: easier way.

Oh, United States, I'm overly interested politics here, less politics countries, odd occasion see/ hear Donald Trump speaking one thing always strikes him: seem like average American much displayed spite, pettiness contempt comes mouth. people unlucky weak immune systems. far know reinfection far resulted ONE death. ONE single death literally millions. people die flu every year bro.

&amp;#x200B;

Wait no, thats backwards Sheep Faster thought? always bloody obvious me. Sounds like came ahead end. I'm happy  Nope. Absolutely right. places government even trying mandate sex with. world come to!?

If thought making sex illegal AIDS epidemic broke could eradicated AIDS! noooo, back people dreaded freedom! see kind mess landed us in! Forget it, Americans always excuse. Rincewind? I'm surprised Ebola honest. came say. kick house age ten become Pokemon masters! /s like know is. live blog covid related interesting article, here's part OP about:

**Two hospitals postponing operations**

 ANP reports St Jansdal hospital Harderwijk Alrijne Hospital Leiderdorp postponing operations. According hospitals, necessary handle influx corona patients.

 Harderwijk hospital cancels planned operations moves location Lelystad. ""This inevitable order urgent care, emergency care oncology, continue,"" says board.

 Non-acute operations also postponed Leiderdorp. Earlier today became clear Rijnstate hospital Zevenaar closing operating theaters two weeks. Viral resistance immunity 100% dependant exposure vaccines (sometimes- that's never guaranteed). Also masks cause bacterial infections. supposed thrown use breathing huge collection microbes collect mask. allowing fester grow feed warm moist air. 

That sterile sanitary. Ever see people face rashes extended mask use? have. need get rid mask day never ever touch mask wearing it. touch it, remove toss it. 

If really want mask protect you, right. Life normal US, NBA finals played without spectators. don‚Äôt think poor healthcare workers would agree assessment, especially next months deal sick. already care see hundreds thousands deaths. OP, used live Asian country lots English teachers. lot opportunities teaching children. curriculum, means two things: one, ""immersion"" two, memorization (a lot education Asia university still rolls way). actually, go long way without *explain* language! need native speaker many countries need college degree (requirement visa). Curriculum provided vs. ""you're own"" mix, among people know.

That said, teaching English career move. Many people use get overseas experience go home. decide stay in-country either trying scrabble industries room development, start schools.

Don't expect Europe: many native near-native speakers. Japan *still* recovering meltdown biggest English language academies several years ago. lot opportunity rest Asia. fair, lots people simply cautious regard. believe immunity? course not. Clearly level immunity. However, many ""wait seers"" like believe simply know (until far enough see reliable studies like one) long lasts, whether asymptomatic mild cases trigger strong response needed, thousand features. Studies like good show wait, see. far, results very, promising. people believe absolutely immunity never never vaccinate completely screwed.  


My personal concerns regarding vaccine bit nuanced. vaccine work, need certain level compliance actually receiving it. current levels skepticism regarding it, number people put piece cloth face protect others let alone inconvenience shot risk hours mildly uncomfortable side effects, serious doubts hit target number even make vaccination program successful, simply faith behavior humans anymore. can‚Äôt prevent sneeze, least putting face elbow stops mucus coming nose mouth. Inb4 original genius reminds us, yet again, government originally predicted far less deaths this. ...or shootings. 517 people killed (\~43 month) 1,748 wounded mass shootings alone USA 2019. trying downplay recent attacks Europe, putting things perspective. That's true. England gets cold around year. I'm saying may survive another lockdown economy hurting like ours.(I'm USA.). sure smell plastic-y crack open fresh one.

But totally right. Bad breath also additional problem people deal with. who? ancedotal scary stories actually turned true would better people taken seriously. I'm brain eyes, stupid. Yes, enough control stay away people. People hiding behind bushes waiting get anything. FFS. Maybe like Pokemon get send wild age ten Yeah. Things aren‚Äôt going great here. got emergency alert covid cases town phone yesterday like amber alert. god damn it! everyone ALWAYS forgets send Australia important memos!

we get left good stuff :( found swedish patriot. 

IMHO, root defenses want, necessarily transpired. guy better hold lottery tickets. True, person quote wrongly uses word means latter. I'm sure summer drop cases summer vacation coinciding, complete coincidence Fuck that, work outside away people last lawns year. I'm still wearing mask then. plus, know whether possibility reinfection months/years later! Praise yeezus! Sorry no. legally can't wear mask driving fogs glasses. good news ! forget AU spring... basically didn‚Äôt care, infuriated even more. feel one cares, :( I'm ""essential worker"" manage worlds largest rigid flexible packaging facility. employ 55,000 people creating packaging food medical supplies. Every single day there's new group people Covid. runs infects entire departments people, would say total facility one third one half people infected. 

That's lot people none died, heck none even hospitalized. 

I've seen ""reality"" scary all. People lose sense smell taste mostly, reported feel extremely fatigued wiped sick struggle cough. 

Fauci even reported day he's worried vaccine going Americans think is. think he's implying going like flu vaccine (because virus) Covid going become seasonal virus scientists need vaccine every single year. 

99.8% survival rate, that's people show symptoms. Many people asymptomatic showing symptoms even know sick got tested putting actual survival rates somewhere ballpark 99.99%  nobody ever enforce need shut up, wear masks, fine hell anybody comply.

Can't imagine think first line BS. EU citizen, *need* 11.000‚Ç¨ (rounding up) special type bank account get residency permit. matter living expenses are, *must* match BAf√∂G get residency permit. Where‚Äôs translation bot? Sorry really get point trying make, really seem know either. 

So actually safe, want people wear ppe, scarf t-shirt would you. Why? Obviously scientific point view, would rather someone medically exempt cover face something going provide medical protection.

It seems like need worry less others focus yourself. plenty mental health respiratory reasons someone could exempt, obvious glance. fact expect shop bouncers staff start demanding authenticating proof laughable. 

It's fine allow life ruled fear, can't force fears insecurities others, much ego tells 

But hey want wrap scarf around face Daily Mail told guest, actually believe free speech freedom choice complete brainer. Parent year tragicomical swedish politicians protesting travel-bans. showing reality sometimes best form satire. shit, it‚Äôs supported government underlined order - they‚Äôre making substantive changes indoor dining, requiring people masks they‚Äôre 100 feet away anyone else french president embraced mask let kids return school fall we've big raise case mask mandatory kids damage done schools still open. saying wrong. That‚Äôs point friend. order incredibly stupid Why?

There parties going on, people visiting homes, close proximity ventilation mask. There's public transport commuters masks windows even open. likely vectors infection caused ""essential"" stuff.

Demanding people wear masks outside even among people akin asking someone put phone silent middle techno club. Huh? So, we're going take 1st gen vaccines year, next gen ones year two that. That's still completely ridiculous around one. cop coming one making thing dangerous point. comical sad. find getting less usual sickness mask wearing. Fewer colds sinus problems allergies. think I‚Äôll keep wearing masks even COVID magically vanished. Clever, icebergs can't fly. Immunity temporary also get another COVID-19 different ""origin"". guy China infected, got cured travelled USA got again. test said one got China. go? Can‚Äôt wait! Virus gone today... smh. Hopefully recovers No. No. explained original comment why. addition that, people wear things like scarves something else greatly obstruct breathing. PPE. Testing limited. Kind expected, considering left lockdown, reopening much quickly. **If reopen quickly lockdown, might well locked all.** Maybe waited reopening *beaches*... sound ""essential"" me. VirusMan: used virus destroy virus! Truthfully fraud blown Tory press, specifically Post Media. might done nearly wide spread thought. need test COVID protect health care workers patients. treatment COVID flu aren‚Äôt same. Tamiflu excellent treatment flu given early.
COVID treatment protocol changes time depending stage virus. same. immigration anything?

New Zeeland didn‚Äôt need military streets, need give house arrest orders everyone weeks. 

They closed borders, schools non-essential businesses. listening interview two scientists yesterday saying Spanish flu never ended. simply changed hosts, mixed viruses, muted process. reality never really ended, people dying flu day still dying Spanish flu. 

For record one people talking Dr. Fauci 

Interviews start towards end, maybe last 25 25min show. straight lies dude. Can't find great table cases per capita, countries worse US include Bahrain, Qatar, Belgium, Israel, Czechia, Panama, Armenia, Kuwait. there's whole lot countries close. also artifact testing.

On deaths per capita US 10th behind Peru, Belgium, Spain, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Argentina. UK slightly lower 11th. Heck yeah! also must close schools. many infected Get help condensed visualization argument importance ""k"" [was put Science Magazine long Me: typing *edm* google. Oh, OK. Nothing change unless actually lockdown nobody goes work schools. cheap ploy make Democrats like he's ""not like Republicans"". see people getting evicted highest unemployment rate country, solution throw restricted money corona curfew, thank yer buddy Baker. White Collar worker state world buying opportunity /s wouldn‚Äôt go around assuming people‚Äôs education. Mathematically, I'd like add superspreading need tied event, members large social group frequently meet changing small subgroups.

This true, though setting seems matter greatly (i.e., close quarters, poor ventilation, much talking/singing), may less spread infectious people meeting others many small subgroups compared large single gatherings (e.g., weddings, choir practice, karaoke bars), former likely involves variety That's another good metaphor, thanks. 

I signal even nobody's 1) good habit 2) someone see.

I wear mask time reasons. wouldn't. He's still very, Republican. he's moderate social issues mean still trying kill MBTA, unions, public schools. believe anyone exempt? save lot money taxes though lol cases around 6500 1/4th 4 days ago 1/2th last Tuesday.

Government announced last week test capacity saturated, assymptomatic tested anymore would suggest let anywhere. would apply indoor public space. easy enforce, seeing places already security/bouncers. Fines could given insist going and/or get aggressive police called. Right literally say 'I'm exempt' leave alone. Vegas, plan ( sort ) heard, alternate days grade schoolers actually went school. Half days, etc. Lots work initially. doubt federal funds going needed, whole argument another time, provide additional safeguards. done already. Like whole bunch things could‚Äôve closer normal. Mitch chuckles Hey! told trump saved everyone. economy booming! Stocks go up! Everyone's amazing could look numbers.

/$ enough testing capacity? not, asymptomatics first list stop testing.

I wonder way. 

Priority one : Contact case/travel potential asymptomatic know whether they're sick sometimes believe fine 

Priority two : Person risk bad form knowing covid would change outcome 

Priority tree : Remaining cases. cares whether covid flu treatment stay home 2 weeks hate country. definitely want leave. Lmaooo Yes, law make people wear there's absolutely reason to.

But build habits. wear everywhere get habit grabbing mask head door. None ""oops, grab mask 90% time I'm alone I'm going store, oh well"".

It avoids risk situations near somebody without realizing it. one walks - usually happen suburban street everyone else inside - passing parked truck someone came behind truck right next me. scared shit other. ""wear masks time public"" phase (before new mandate came out) also wearing one (I think delivery person) okay.

It also helps discourage people pulling mask they're situation sometimes pass within social distancing area times they're far enough apart. easy mess forget do. Wearing mask time easier safer situation.

Unfortunately, benefits come cost someone who's 100% alone rural street hours. know what? they're really alone know probably get away wearing mask bothers much. one report them. Covids confirmed deaths estimated deaths. local news station stop posting Coronavirus counts website? election? I'd rather use mask actually needed instead treated like fucking child can't use brain.  It‚Äôs possible reason isn‚Äôt much information scenario risk making worse probably negligible. may risk all. would probably take many precautions possible since it‚Äôs difficult things you‚Äôre doing. Everything neer Dunkin, resident checks out! theme MA: take one step outside store, remove mask take deep breath. 

Are trying say wrong? would introduced Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 5. don‚Äôt live don‚Äôt clue you‚Äôre talking about. accurate assessment opinion? get it? asked literally anything tyranny--that's Americans go stores pantsless smear buns deli counter. Freedom! Freedom!

i probably joke, realize clothes=coercion...oops. extremely stupid saying ""stealing 
their childhood"" 6.months person classes.

 find absolute disrespect children whose childhood really stolen , like refugees, war victims , orphans street kids. 

Go tell syrian kid poor first-world baby got childhood irremediably stolen Zoom classes.

But even then, worried kids, ever wonder locking daycare 6 hs day strangers kids might aggressive bully really best childhood? actual retort point made oversaturating medical infrastructure. Figures. Typical selfish dumbass. call ""independent,"" refuse see wrong selfish seem

I'll wear mask near people wearing glasses mask fucking worst want able see.

Shit‚Äôs hard. Aside actual monumental task allowed live foreign country, expat really difficult. don‚Äôt realize values culture live society challenges them. It‚Äôs draining constantly told something hold near dear heart totally irrelevant peers.

Plus there‚Äôs language barrier. Sure everyone Germany speaks English it‚Äôs language; idea they‚Äôre going interpreted and, frankly, don‚Äôt care. People constantly say super rude things English idea they‚Äôre it. thing people German. learn foreign language cows come home you‚Äôll never native speaker. 

Wenn ich zur√ºck gehen k√∂nnte, h√§tte ich nichts anderes gemacht. 

p.s. sure German universities foreign tuition (for now) mean free. still need $20,000 year cover living expenses miscellaneous costs associated moving abroad. work experience doesn‚Äôt mean jack shit don‚Äôt formal qualifications back (i.e. master‚Äôs degree). LOL. Dude sorry. You‚Äôre nuts. Blacks people accepted society Europe. Middle Easterners. live segregated ghettos. still indicators available even double blinded trial.

They know composition trial group compare infection rate general population (weighted composition trial group) area they're running trial number infections trial. Prior unblinding, trial count total number infections entire group (vaccine arm + control arm). vaccine effective, number infections go slowly general population. effective all, pace less general population.

Since readout occurs predetermined number infections trial group reached, also means effective vaccine is, longer takes get readout. even researchers even know many infected complete trial group, know binary ""enough"" / ""not enough"" status, know time passing without ""enough"" level reached good sign. Aha... 14 million children 74 milkion exception find concerning? maybe 1 5 exception? think term exception little bit wrong... agree you. dangerous attitude have, especially country like theirs.

Hi Stan I've never seen one, though might couple Boston somewhere Marriage hard (At least EU). took us 3 months. UNLESS RIOT NOBODY CARES. Wait, satin panties?

When burp, still get graveyard taste say (it great description). can't tell getting better higher tolerance now. know, tell wear mask nobody around longer safety anymore. wearing mask nobody near preventing spread virus? Since basis science, doubt would withstand legal challenge. point notice correlation shame it. That's interpretation, mine. Boston third densely populated major city country, FYI. 13,000 foot mountains within city limits, assure you. know written scientist (not free will, least) CDC.

This new. already know going happen keep pretending C19 hoax.

Next year odds bit lower, older may accumulated damage. lol country gets zero new cases day we're STILL going freak people outside without mask? GTFOH wonder dont count deaths illnesses way Covid?  wonder European countries imposing second national lockdowns perfect opportunity Sweden impose first national lockdown. article garbage.

10,000 people die nursing homes CoVID19.

130,000 people didn‚Äôt die illnesses got called covid.

CoVID19 causes body suspectable pneumonia, also makes ailments fatal short term.

Your whole article crap. agree mid 2021 breaking point, think likely people continue wear masks disregard social distancing/gatherings. area, widespread support masks I've noticed many people using ""shields"" simply whatever want. ""We party, attend wedding, hang friends - wear masks okay!"". predict mask-wearing continue quite while, behavior change become lax. Numbers people 29 years age died covid: 12 facts real anymore *citation needed. Crazy times changed. Well 230k dead certainly have.   Yep. feels like theater. manager class either stupid and/or evil. I‚Äôm amazed headline isn‚Äôt 6 months ago. soon see effect new restrictions last week yet. Anecdotally, reports rather empty metro stations Stockholm 8 morning. That's least good sign. Exactly! Students required wear school hear thirteen year old sister, nobody wears correctly. addition need keep 3 feet distance school.

This mandate address spread happening Boston sub people think I'm kind anti-mask nut calling blatant security theater token mandate.

This spreading schools, house parties, indoor dining. end psychos charge. less age group dying infecting will. isn‚Äôt concerned subject, please describe one-functiin masks? sound like expert knows mask protects people you, protect people. I'm wondering property filters facilitate one-way instead two-way travel. kinds wierdo, coronavirus denying subs bruh. want try change narrative people fucked country denials science total lack common sense Republican. one fooled, one finds words worth. completely full shit fuck that. people going out, car accident victims, people scared possible covid exposure, etc dying. complications could get weaker people could infect. worse people realizing it... actively deny it. vast majority deaths older people, old actually several years higher average life expectancy country. goes sub's narrative, downvoted, I'm sure too. Like what? USA population 1864 - 31 million

USA population 2020 - 328 million mean? already happening. might've case prior pandemic. currently Man wish back Boston. left Boston UK really liked Baker handled pandemic. nonsense guy. He's probably republican politician would legitimately hug. could next year, year after. That's missing keywords statement yes. Also schools six feet needed apparently. required maintain 3 ft social distance. Masks still mandatory school.

This feels like token gesture make look like state something. said ""not important"" call second wave. he's using newspeak usual.

""Sustainable"" newspeak ""nobody gives shit"" strategy.

Yes. strategy big failure. That's FHM wants ~~lockdowns~~ ""recommendations"" stay home now. Muse still fantastic live act, know mean Source? nonsense Sweden. Check mate, bish. ""Percentage people know someone covid symptoms verses people wearing masks public"" weak trend line. Wtf? That's statistic? serious? covid shows smaller death rates places like GA Sweden NY Texas. ""spikes"" even occur mandates. 

Those numbers real. real statistic. people making money fear really getting creative lies. anyway, show info mask mandates happen vs rates deaths. Animal Farm 2 + 2 = 5 level manipulation facts. I'm Argentinian nope thanks I'll pass &lt;3 wear mask around others

Of course, polite correct thing do. keep mind many around be. [""The mask ordinance affect voting locations ) UAE antiVaxxers thankfully.

The new restrictions introduced regions risk ending situation.

Among things, personal assistance staff meet care recipient lower spread infection compared forms care close patient. learned personal assistance responsibility authorities disseminate knowledge?  lot learn, especially among nursing homes, limit number contacts. many different staff care recipient meets, course increases risks. remember different groups take care of, difference risks personal assistance compared live nursing homes risks much higher. exaggerate differences, depend much differences groups care for, says Tegnell.

What think behind increased spread infection Sk√•ne?

*- Sk√•ne differ much regions, private parties gatherings account large part, consistent spread infection spread home workplace. third part third scattered different places often connected parties, says Tegnell*.

What mean commuters move Sweden Denmark different strategies?

The spread infection lower Sk√•ne compared metropolitan regions.

Many big cities hit hard spring hit hard infection increasing still mouth guards. says important, Sweden follow it. something considering again?  constantly considering possible tools, see dramatic improvement introduced Europe. new knowledge important thing keep distance. see spread infection takes place private parties hard time believing environment succeed introducing mouth protection, says Tegnell.  question mouth protection public transport.  answer before. nothing statistics shows people highly infected public transport, rather workplace. signs countries introduced oral protection public transport way succeeded limiting spread infection. always say would much worse introduced them, difficult see could worse right Belgium Czech Republic introduced mouth guards. following developments. important thing work home reduce pressure.  signal value wear mouth guard remind pandemic restrictions.  Yes, possible, study Netherlands followed closely showed bad keeping distance introduction. Look angry now, swearing making baseless assumption. Funny person quickly loses proven wrong. Max 8 people house/family. 3 one family 5 another etc China control, unaware. Blame incompetence government (US) anyone. sort tests expensive, timely, available public necessarily. So, yes, get small sample size Asia families self-isolate upon discovery symptoms

The asian study looked situations index patient isolated well not.  still keeping schools open? so, that's kind pointless since masks provide much protection sitting indoors people prolonged period time. Counterproductive measures add spectacle point lack seriousness. manager class either stupid evil. Coming guy posts every single day nothing value. There's life circle jerking echo chamber kid. That's probably people pretend worried future business lockdowns considered consequence actions. Naah greene king Melbourne proved wrong. Tegnell admit Sweden second wave yet?

And happened ""sustainable Swedish strategy""?

I guess sustainable all? ""no body goes anymore, crowded"" feel like 100 person sample size pretty small, maybe that's me. 230,000 deaths far preventable, normal you? that's even final form? wearing masks 200 days counting.

That‚Äôs kind worst case scenario, keep mind. realize interventions put place may effect r0, hopefully direction lowering it, single individual decision immediate result ‚Äòkilling fuckton people‚Äô? balance much need lower r0 considerations, like well children. sorts risk. Banning cars would lower car accident deaths dramatically. Yet choose keep cars car-related deaths. Babies included aswell this. even less reason about. need run errands, arrangements made. order everything online too. errands many. make one big supply run month kid stays somewhere. 

Don't tell can't done. There's excuse endangering lifes recklessly. 

I comprehend even debate. anything say this.

If excuses make feel better, good you. think good human being. I'm terrible human being, I'll anything power endanger others. least do.  meant rounding curb upward... straight top. Yeah, guess could sort thing see Flu. Multiple strains, maybe catch second time different strain, vaccine would incorporate prevalent strains. silver bullet. develop it, pay it, get it. Kinda tired communist propaganda framing ""hoarding"". ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs slowing down!‚Äù - Trump, probably Cruise ships may well require vaccine board. also idea effective it'll be. realize coronavirus become yearly vaccine like flu shot? one solution virus. elderly person stay home scared? still take long time over, vaccine least gives perspective light end tunnel. Dude, audacity. :/ agree. used 15 minute example show difficult even relatively short period time be. 1 minute difficult beginning. Thank adding that. deadly majority people. vulnerable stay home. think so. People wildly underestimate rapid thing spreads. virus every corner America. really fear going impossible contain without vaccine soon numbers go treshold? Increase certain period?

The typical measurments wave trough trough, peak peak, zero-crossing zero crossing.

In data see one pairs, seen peak second wave can't measure peak peak, zero-crossing can't use method.

What measure first wave trough trough, see reversal back towards peak.

The first wave started March ended late July. late September numbers started drastically increasing again, signaling start second wave. ‚úã‚úä *Blue Igloo* starts... 1 4 us dead.

Great Reset indeed. They're willing happen. Okay. post comment? underestimating power military build field hospitals. also two huge hospital ships. almost like death spiral. likely not, FHM surge cases fall ""their likely scenario"" back summer.

Not mention, Sweden decentralized hospital system 21 regions responsible tracing - FHM. France wait election disappear well? Youre hopeful.

I'm not. know people thinking, restaurant (inside) since March. Stay away crowded indoor spaces extent possible. know COVID sucks, COVID continue suck life economy control. normal, people take risks time, like speeding, drastically increases chance dying crash, yet everyone it. I‚Äôm saying be. I‚Äôm saying opposite either. 

Listen, don‚Äôt think anyone say anything corona future now. Sweden might end living hell. temporary anomaly. I‚Äôm going act latter. Wrong. Solutions horizon light end tunnel getting brighter brighter every hour passes. 
Enjoy downvotes. Intel's vaccine probably still 14nm particles lot less impactful tell people wear masks woods close businesses state too. many cases going prevent trail walkers? all? many cases would shutting person dining prevent? Hundreds? Thousands? 

And city after, limit order city. impact suburbs rural population dopes live Boston. Even true, enough vaccinate everyone right away, may effective people hope. 

They'll probably still help, get wrong, think we're long way ditching face masks shunning indoor dining restaurants. I'm okay now, trying enjoy things get it! really suck, made feel quite while. hope comes back soon, forget eat, otherwise end yo unconscious floor like me, lmao! Hmm, think rush tests. People need time feel side effects, etc. things literally take time. can't make good caramel 10 minutes, even kitchen 50 different chefs. Then, we'll run battle ""I take vaccine, &lt;INSERT CONSPIRACY immunity seem work COVID. it, get again. Yea let's forget it. thousands deaths per week. /s Yes no. dated girl really small Town many years ago. remember going bar talking lot people. people would consider stupid actually highly specialized one thing. people could change car engine, one guy could master Plumbing, another great construction worker on. Problem is, that's thing know. really blinds lot reality life critical thinking Oh gulag something didn‚Äôt do, communists did? think good guy?

Trump win. Come get it, think weak costal elites able trial(if that) jail(or more) fully half America? Fucking dream psycho.

No aren‚Äôt capable it, without destroying economy. It‚Äôs widespread, endemic, hides well many viral generations. supposed offend something? literally called fat ass like one comment ago dude. stop pretending like I'm talking running woods fucking moron.

250,000 dead big deal? fuck European Union ordered 300 million initial doses, spread equally member states based population numbers. also rollout plan place help member states rollout vaccination programs smoothly.

This excludes United Kingdom decided make arrangements seperately. got mine said 5x normal season. safe feel cruise ship 5000 people unknown percentage vaccine even (including you), vaccine 50 60% effective? Maybe works out, maybe doesn't. Well, know, could true, determine year talking about. That's 9/11 event per day....and people want ride out. Oh shut man There‚Äôs actually bit research suggesting so. me, really skeptical old virology/immunology professors starting saying fb schools sources significant spread. kill poor people starvation diseases? good look, dude. That‚Äôs true. linear math doesn‚Äôt take account cumulative cases would hospitals healthcare capacity stretched, deaths go massive factor. Hospital care keeping mortality rate low. I'm sure 2000 more. New cases already starting flatten. Like said different thread, around 100,000 new cases per day peak think US see. Daily deaths, opinion, scientific btw, go much higher 1500. Even 2 weeks surge right now. got better treating back march april. wonder become annual inoculation saying saying Civil War II: Electric Boogaloo starts tomorrow, daily deaths cut half? Sweden 566 deaths per million ü§î. NY, NJ, MA, CT, DC, MI higher rates open states. Interesting, 7 day average daily deaths Georgia THREE FUCKING PEOPLE. look graphs TX Georgia fluctuating around numbers. Masks really work bc small margin? even Europe, strictest mandates lockdowns currently higher rates. preponderance evidence one side. evidence even full picture. 

Quality life needs taken account. cars would fewer deaths quality life would much worse. Even cigarettes kill TWICE YES TWICE many people Covid see banning cigarettes would hurt society way helps. 

We live fantasy. can't ""protect"" people average life expectancy without proportionally destroying 1000 young lives life ""saved"". Diseases exist primates without mature vaccines, moist cloth suffocating day never human history proven stop diseases, even CDC acknowledged multiple times past. term 10x stronger response meant 10x higher concentration antibodies. right terms stronger immunity misused together, optimal immunity stronger immune response anything mild inflamation cytokine storm anaphylactic shock, dont want kind stro ng... circle guys. idea, people get vaccinated late winter yes, people get vaccinated Spring keep mind could take month immune protection vaccine kick in. something goes wrong vaccine distribution people vaccinated mostly summer, fall 2021 could see effect. Fuck scott gottlieb Wow, [citation needed] like, every single assertion there. even making argument, stating right.

I provided source masks needed maintaining social distance possible.

Could provide one backing assertion masks required beyond that? I'm saying thing mutate anywhere level influenza does. Also, flu vaccine created average six months flu season using strain(s) prevalent southeast Asia. try predict hit us always different slowly making way around world us. 

And even various mutations observed SARS-CoV-2so far regions code viral epitopes going using vaccines. Considering using strains currently opposed using something different months actual final strain here, coverage much better flu vaccine.

Lol Indeed, right. doesn‚Äôt make sense whatsoever. Trump made get elected? Biden made get elected/ get Trump kicked out? don‚Äôt understand. necessarily mean that. Cases ever rise. Even nobody infected, cases always rise 0.8-4% false positive rate. measures never intended stop spread, flatten curve, means definition, extend numbers longer time frame. no? jealous can't never 50 acres land like mother run around wants property completely mask free.

## Abstract 

Background: Cognitive impairment common following critical illness. number case reports case series suggested cognitive deficits occur patients COVID-19. study evaluated frequency, severity, profile cognitive dysfunction hospitalized patients recovering COVID-19. 

Methods: obtained analyzed cross-sectional neuropsychological data cohort N=57 patients participating inpatient rehabilitation. primary outcome measure Brief Memory Executive Test (BMET). calculated frequency impairment based clinician diagnosis BMET subtests using age-normed classification impairment. explored associations intubation extubation markers illness severity complications, well psychiatric diagnosis. 

Results: sample 75% male, 61% non-white, mean age 64.5 (SD = 13.9) years. Patients evaluated mean 43.2 days post-admission. 88% documented hypoxemic respiratory failure 77% required intubation. 81% patients cognitive impairment, ranging mild severe. Deficits common working memory (55% patients impaired), set-shifting (47%), divided attention (46%), processing speed (40%). Executive dysfunction significantly associated intubation length time extubation assessment, associated presence psychiatric diagnosis. Discussion 

Conclusion: Medically stable inpatients recovering COVID-19 commonly deficits attention executive functions. deficits significantly correlated length intubation time since extubation. Findings provide early benchmark studying evolution cognitive difficulties COVID-19 suggest easy disseminate interventions remediate attention executive dysfunctions may important population. Ok understand mean. people know 5-10 people

Do study 100 humans ingest cyanide capsule. dies. small sample size determine cyanide likely adverse effects humans? No, course not. observe strong effect, that's good indication effect real. completely destroy economy small/private businesses. Look bright side, lots job openings, better traffic, fewer crowds amusement parks re-open. good thing. course data suggest treatment better. Deaths can't even hit thousand right now, new cases, 2 weeks ago,were 50-60k day. spring, half deaths easily around 2k day. Deaths rise too. comparing new cases see, bad. bad overall? Yes, is. bad compared new cases day? much spring, fortunately. Ugh. Brady Health Center. Calling anything glorified exam room generous. us 'Muricans understand better cases/1M.  looking yesterday's figure based 7 day moving average cases? always slight variations day. early say whether actually dropped byt rest week carries cases downward slope definitely good news. I'd rather look 7 day moving average account daily fluctuations saying ~~up to~~ 6 months.

Edit:

It indeed state 'at least six months' study, though six month study. data disagrees... deaths perspective moved months. positive tests explode, implies far lower death rate far untested cases US. 

That said, avoiding death. want get thing. want deal unknowns long-term effects. ‚ÄúThis is¬†probably going densest¬†phase pandemic.‚Äù ‚ÄîDr. Scott Gottlieb

‚ÄùThe densest phase ***so far***.‚Äù ‚ÄîHomer Simpson

Seriously, think we‚Äôll lucky early fall densest period. expect mid late winter worse. isolating little babies 

I talking all. I'm saying babies isolated. I'm saying public. family around home. many people think baby needs around? think anymore 3 4 good anyways. Besides, even know are? notion quite ludacris. think babies travel much bunch reasons. making wear face masks years cmon get grip

You mean wear masks week tops absolutely go somewhere? Even though doubt babies go often. I'm 33 leave house week groceries.

Also talking years? Years happen continue leniency. Sacking really locking 1-2 months make numbers plummit hard almost go back normal.

And here's kicker: I've suicidal depressed almost 20 years isolation affect all. truly depressed, really give shit. I'm little proud isolate well actually. area many people protesting recall governor allow Disneyland reopen, causing big loss local sales tax revenues rents continue indefinitely.

It's sort outage fuels outbreaks describe. Interesting. teach elementary ages? Belgiums healthcare beginning collapse neighbours take spillover? Yeah, fantastic news. Usually write-ups lot restaurants reason. several shows obvious pattern misbehavior job fire show cause. Otherwise fight it. good there‚Äôs even option patients treated hospitals outside country hospitals nearby countries capacity so

I still see good thing Belgiums healthcare system barely staying afloat we're still weeks away peak hospitalisations. putting cherry pile dog shit. saying least 6 months sleep peacefully tonight knowing we'll 0 cases 0 deaths tomorrow 

/s bad thing happening. Germany helping Belgium deal bad thing. what's called good here, obviously covid bad. got tested positive virus October 5th 6th later tested negative roughly two weeks later 

Lately I've chest pains today difficulty talking breathing, do? Learn live mean adjusting it. Wearing masks, social distancing, recognizing lives different it.

Not ignoring entirely. Health experts aren‚Äôt worried compared amount folks actively infecting other, risks posed frozen food small comparison. put plainly - aren‚Äôt going worry frozen COVID many places basically given already. Exactly. Dumb rules ones people ignore. hard get compliance wearing mask (and i'm talking outside) maybe answer increase rules evaluate people following rule. likely they've evaluated risk realize chances getting COVID amount would infect small worth wearing mask outside. And, far, evidence supports position. neverending failure understand frustrating. cannot imagine must like epidemiologist times. Typically struggle get people understand risk spread across people take measures personally may end protected by, pandemic taking new levels.

It basic, important, yet since we've got like 10,000 COVID contrarians running around TV telling people basically precaution worse letting SARS-CoV-2 run wild, ProPublica report notes ‚ÄúIt ends seeing world makes clinically depressed‚Äù, things change. wish people understood locking Sweden legal constitutional issue Exactly, Germany efficient throughout health crisis, need get bigger army fine regardless happens anywhere else.

I honestly embarrassed country, back spring, tried offering outdated ventilators Italy. ventilators reeaally old could used delicate treatment sars2 victims. time government continued allow tourism hotspots health department said *didn't think virus would ever arrive here* .... pure illogical money grabbing idiocy way through. Insane said, rate could hit 99%. cap it. seem like will. 100k new cases day seems limit. India never saw hit badly. billions people, argument ""not testing enough"" even work. virus viral enough infect people one day's time. exists certain speed spread. Masks mostly place too. Wherever rising, rising long. currently seeing worst numbers new cases. Deaths follow. mention despite killing 3 times many Americans flu shorter period time, I'm told much lower mortality rate flu. Nothing worry about. cold. It‚Äôs need treat people good, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs said. What‚Äôs good there‚Äôs even option patients treated hospitals outside country hospitals nearby countries capacity so. would even worse patients could transferred different hospitals different countries left overcrowded hospitals completely untreated. almost like news cover one topic. Crazy, know. trusting experts president, governors local officials, that‚Äôs issue. charge try downplay sweep rug. Thanks, believe made right decision personally. daughter course sooooo mad found two friends returning class thankfully gets directing anger ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù us. screams ‚Äústupid Covid!!‚Äù storms room... sigh. It‚Äôll get better. It‚Äôll get better. planes dropped sky could stop using them. 

Covid fucks us wether want not. Conjecture. Sweden taking tack rather minimized clear guidelines receive better compliance long term onerous restrictive guidelines. Damnit.

I understand this, still wearing mask walking dog woods gonna suck. Germany spearheading unity union.

I want political, hope covid cooperation catch back non cooperative attitude topics. say spearheading unity union. talking that, regardless much want equate two vastly different dont understand difference point even discussing anything you. - unique. 
B- Excess deaths, many people died X amount months year vs average year tells need know. bunch people dead without virus, disease causes, subsequent response. can‚Äôt claim numbers flattening. Take rally‚Äôs going across states Trumps Biden add people voting.. give another 2 weeks bet numbers go back breaking records everyday. Oh Halloween.... data support better treating virus compared March April. don‚Äôt even understand anyone could look facts come conclusion! true America worse ever! one wants right predicting things going get worse. It‚Äôs absolutely awful every way ppl losing lives country can‚Äôt get shit together people ignorant facts repeated much getting better control things. fact things getting better country regardless numbers right now, it‚Äôs absolutely going increase next weeks. sign going back spike. experience opposite. students always masks on, become new normal them.

The kids even social distance line bathroom, lunch, etc standing still putting arms making sure can't touch next closest person also arms out.

And cousin sent Snapchat day 8 10 year old home, 'playing school', went got masks put since that's they're used school.

Kids problem everything I've seen, teachers much harder time impressing parents important masks are.  need 50 posts Sturgis day, good vaccine news? 
üò¥
üò¥ turned many corners back spot. moment now! flu meth PED's bro.. like Lance Armstrong flu's... still flu.  Germany could 300.000 total armed forces something like that. think France raised total armed forces 500.000, Germany could 500.000 well. 

Germany defenceless appear peaceful :) Myocarditis splash blood clots lungs . would better strictly enforce reasonable rule rather making rules unreasonable easier enforce.  weeks ago read somewhere international agency organization said 2018 USA number one 185 countries prepared pandemic. note source nothing bullshit. Later wonder sinister plans. people agencies ought prison bombed US fighter jets found guilty beyond reasonable doubt. lease weaponized COVID-19 virus comparable SARS MERS kill people. let spread intentionally. talk letting spread slowly, flattening curve, instead containing early outbreaks. Flattening curve lets spread slowly carriers virus populations impossible contain unless perfect silver bullet vaccine found. lock downs changes peoples behavior causing K recovery curve people become wealthy others driven poverty. Vaccines help, COVID-19 probably exist decades like common flu, deadly. Life expectancy birth probably reduced 10 years.

Why would agencies betrayed people Americas Europe? maybe conspiracy kill significant percent elderly infirm obese attempt reduce health care costs, yet make money treatments people find acceptable spend health care.

The counties contained COVID-19 continue prevent new outbreaks good government culture, US's CDC. Probably proclaiming ""This end"" dumb. do, also cut slack thinking could mildly fellating trump public. 

Fauci took unbridled righteous approach preaching truth right. also got ousted inner circle. knocking Fauci hes god damn hero. understand birx played hand like that.  Well least one happen, vaccine progress seems politically neutral. New cases rising, Halloween anti-masker rave 10k people, look like calm storm. Remember, whenever see people wearing surgical masks...please remind clean it. Otherwise, get diseases. does't matter, still spread people risk group. Wow you‚Äôre really confused direction traffic jams every weekend. Illinois currently highest number new cases daily country, got room talk. We‚Äôre sicker Wisconsin. wearing mask year ago flu season? might saved lives. Even took shot 100% effective, better safe right? Except like people likely worn mask last year. realize needs balance caution call selfish comfort would call considerations? funny kind hyperbole upvoted reddit kind hyperbole called out. Cool story. since interested actually communicating repeating something irrelevant. good day? Oh shit. kind heart damage, myo/pericarditis? hope recover soon! Nah, youre dipshit cult member.

Why right wing dipshits say shit like this? one wants tolerate stupidity proignorance, family abandoned you. Na, we'll fine. vast majority BLM protesters wore masks handed needed Yep. Florida chilling 17 cases per 100,000, Illinois 50/100k. yet anybody flies Florida, quarantine 2 weeks allowed travel Cook County. like people Illinois somehow denial bad here. lyrics? part always sounded like mumbling it‚Äôs Turkish Takeoff. Initially, year thought this. losing entire year lives virus, unknown end sight, decided try, I'm currently 6 weeks. isolating strictly, trying take solace idea hopefully least avoid illnesses bugs would normally encounter, relaxed physically active WFH, avoiding awkward conversations consuming alcohol. Hoping things marginally better June. FWIW, family made point ordering chain restaurants, make point send business local family guys.

Many neighbors same. Check table 4. Smoking prevalence significantly lower almost every study, case hypertension diabetes, mostly significantly higher prevalence (as expected since risk factors) nonsignificant compared population average. Also, prevalence current smokers COPD cohort uknown substantial, might cause also significantly lower prevalences observed. conclusion vague disappointing, least recommend research topic Germans think need bigger army, thanks. We're fine way are, reduce actually. way could spend even money health care system. countries try it. ‚ÄúI alone solve this‚Äù opinion, that's good fine unless people solely focus happiness little empathy anyone outside small circle. 

Having members community able see world different perspectives empathize others regardless different situations essential thriving society. fair, ""Nobles"" probably consider anytime peasants speak anything revolt. Blood clots continue wreak havoc patients severe COVID-19 infection, new study explains may spark half culprit: autoimmune antibody that's circulating blood, attacking cells triggering clots arteries, veins, microscopic vessels. Blood clots cause life-threatening events like strokes. And, COVID-19, microscopic clots may restrict blood flow lungs, impairing oxygen ""In patients COVID-19, continue see relentless, self-amplifying cycle inflammation clotting body,"" Kanthi says. ""Now we're learning autoantibodies could culprit loop clotting inflammation makes people already struggling even ""Antibodies patients active COVID-19 infection created striking amount clotting animals‚Äîsome worst clotting we've ever seen,"" Kanthi says. ""We've discovered new mechanism patients COVID-19 may develop blood clots.""

Lovely.... UK probably best position vaccine Europe we've made arrangements. every single manufacturer we've agreed deals vaccine proven successful, we'll 340mil doses population 67mil. know likely be, we're good position regardless. pure stress dramatic changes life many people dropping over. die broken heart anyone lost inner circle. mean much me. people someone special. Please keep trying safe get together fellow humans. I'm assuming person speaking hyperbole (as pretty common people).

I mean, number 9 death rankings Worldometer great. arguably, worse countries. count number excess deaths might even worse. -_-

The US handled pandemic TERRIBLY blood Trump's hands. Science give bad news, everyone knows Science helped surely, think unprecedented backing behind played much larger role. understand, pharmaceutical companies generally mass produce vaccines they've proven effective, they've able time around due massive amounts money provided governments around world. even aside already bunch standby, allows larger scale testing throughout phases.  OP ""special"" alright Barney way. 2bil significant large parts western world majority 1st world going providing replying WHO. Hypothetically speaking every single country organisation successfully used vaccine doses 50% global population would vaccine. obviously pipedream think happens 2021, hopefully rapid testing better treatments vital achieve it. Time tell ""covfefe""? Damn, feels like decade ago. Myocarditis 9/11 thousand people. numbers! many third world countries missing critical vaccinations pushed poverty. fallout dust finally settles huge. CDC COVID19 Activity checklist:

Work  X Yeah, Charles Barkley Chaos Dunk virus away! thought B-cells created antibodies.   Misunderstood initial comment them. Apologies Even though Chicago, LOT rural small towns. schools business's confirmed cases closing. numbers country reported age groups asking know. See kids school age 3-4 per age group them, schools announcing anything. Infection numbers already started dropping extra rules, extra rules speed more, closing schools judged necessary this. imagine headlines inundating subreddit day vaccinations start...one day wont infuriated reposts. asking sources proves claims false. want people take virus seriouly. people raising claims nothing disprove them. Except can't know many people around minute now. moments leave. got there. Also continuously pulling pulling mask pass others makes mask wearing less effective. wear mask less people die. selfish person can't ""sacrifice"" wearing mask run less people die personally selfish person. slight discomfort people fucking die fucking brainer! shouldnt mandate people already, covid shown load people dumb selfish people things save lives force too. actual chemist checking (PhD, active research). nano-research mostly snake oil, take grain sand idea talking about.
In imagination man sits alone field cops coming arrest mask on. also introduced 15 minute rapid tests available everyone around $12. Sweden highest number deaths per capita Europe two full months, mid may mid July. Except virus grown like anywhere. done years. 100% agree, comparing us exceptional outliers fair. case american self-righteousness dont buy american exceptionalism, worst playing white knight fucked shit rest world addition ourselves.
Edit - maybe I'm outlier recognised this. far worse anyone worse South Korea

Which it? Verizon still lagging behind :/ open secret blinded? Nobody authority comment public knows anything regarding effectiveness. That‚Äôs blinding works. Norway. I`m sick it. ready single burst severely strict restrictions eradicate thing society. PS: pandemic seriously looking forward driving Germany summer vacation. Well, didn`t happen, can`t wait see country soon realize wasn‚Äôt ruled basis state cannot so, Newsom exceeded authority?

This doesn‚Äôt support position all, moron would think did, must joking, good sir.

Also judge‚Äôs ruling doesn‚Äôt counter United States Supreme court case cited.

That‚Äôs court system precedent works.

Edited fix typo  said biden would cancel Easter Exactly. Remember supposedly massive fine filling forms stating going stay quarantine came state? ever enforced? No. Indeed. point changed original good, people reuse bacterial contamination outside area used masks demonstrated, showed significant correlation microbial air quality working probably safe use, lead autoimmune problems overreacting immune system.  US wealthiest country considering wealth, pretty fucking badly trending bad direction.

I'm Korean-American I'll put way, US ain't close South Korea handling things.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, what's prize here? Olympics gets deaths? they're 'vast majority'

they're 'vocal majority' USA! USA! USA!

 ^(Help us) Whats gleaned data change. look wet masks people wearing longer longer see extra concentrated virus masks. Holy crap Florida  daily death toll though. Always careful interpreting numbers monday/tuesday. Ok, buddy lol No. Nobody knows Data Safety Monitoring Board sworn secrecy. It‚Äôs blinded. body creates cells fighting virus turn creates antibodies help reinfection. red zone Florida: ""Back soon?"" whole lot long term side effects this. Many kids miss entire year education. Many living fear things don‚Äôt understand. Many missing good meal got school. Many develop depression mental illness isolation fear. sorts long term damage talking about.

There easy decisions here. shouldn‚Äôt pretend making children pay huge price fight COVID. price wont fully understand many years  complicit. recommended shifting reporting CDC Palantir, underreporting numbers. mean, official anything Right? pointed people likely argue exercising. disagree mandate all. apparently people thought pointing may find exercising mask unpleasant. Torrent? link account? zero idea talking about. guy referring also posted bunch subs languages. I'd honestly hope lack political historical knowledge well low level political transparency plays role well. 

It pains think much country little character/empathy, looking like truth. true. Eh, terrorist groups middle east wanted west collapse lol Wait, know answer one! Something about...more testing equals higher numbers. 

/s aware Norway Sweden using strategy. fact Norway much higher infection rate March Sweden seemed opted enforcement rather advisories like Sweden. example Norwegians banned going summer homes, whereas even advised Sweden. 

PLus Norway actually higher urban density Sweden infection rates surpassed Sweden following strategy. Might fact, 100% misintepreted, usually sub  misleading claim COVID-19 ""Is x times deadlier flu"".

Remember common flu reduced MANY years vaccinations, ""flu shots"". So, comparing apples oranges make comparison. That's still political issue - kinds things political leader looking at, focus science making decision based logic science what's going make popular short term. 

In Melbourne plenty comments - early restrictions second lockdown, restrictions harsh went stage 3 stage 4, targets ending lockdown unreasonable, they're taking long open up, hey Europe learned live etc etc. premier (state leader) facing persistent criticism media, socials. now, less 50 cases across entire state, new cases reported 5 days straight, almost exactly line predicted road map critics forced eat humble pie watch horror what's happening Europe US.

TL;DR Politicians going along masses want health officials recommending still political failure. ages morbidity factors deaths ? mean seriously, updates make sense. Yes new cases deaths. Make 90,084 5:58pm CST. Things getting better. Good luck everyone. candidates currently phase 3 That's good news. Honestly would expect rapid denaturing, idea stable RNA particular supposed be. rules apply them! combination factors, hit right around sports break tons swedish people abroad vacation, italy popular one. assuming avoid coming back sue anything like that. say, ‚Äúwe refunded you. Goodbye.‚Äù Ok, seriously, outsider, someone explain Florida me? anyone checked water lead? wondering thing. One coworkers making fun getting tested (I work patients...kind want make sure I‚Äôm unknowingly spreading around more). Sometimes think we‚Äôre special kind stupid here. American handling Covid-19 incompetent.Imagine many resources still able handle pandemic 10 months started. positive send covid prison ward. care bout niceties like personal freedom liberties there. remember even Australia reinstated strict lockdown Melbourne quell outbreaks. lasted weeks! Americans Europeans tolerate kind intrusion restriction daily lives. much evil, selfish, hypocrite, psychopath, etc. thought want one person point property mask makes large gigantic water droplets blocked another mask inhalation?

No. vast majority masks people wearing, inhale air breathe around sides mask mask material itself. Well, people wore masks yada yada spread would stop would disappear   agree gamble simple restrictions together strong recommendations result lot deaths spring, also think Sweden would done much better strickter approach. pan long run still determined, look good, especially compared nordic countries.

That said, gamble never intentionally increasing immunity means infection.

And also, many things contributed different numbers Norway Sweden, different strategies one them, might never know large effects things was. mean, look different spread inside Sweden, strategy. good news. government telling people vote. Anyone isolation quarantine feel guilty going vote. heard least 4 friends safely delivered babies. Thanks. Nah past point shit needs divine intervention. ANYONE knows behind DSMB integrity data ruined. That's point blinding. anyone go immunogenicity data. late but... I‚Äôve working remotely since March. bought first house July, started new (also remote) job August. even waited close house since changing jobs makes really hard get mortgage approved. 

Well currently sitting hotel room NJ asked come visit office ASAP. Turns I‚Äôm super duper amazing new job because... well, lot reasons, mainly I‚Äôm chick bit charm barely technical knowledge trying run operations company. 

Anyway, owner wanted come get hands around everything. Could said no? Yeah I‚Äôm sure, risk losing new job, taking large loan place live? 

It shocks even idea specific time. Higher counts we‚Äôve seen thus far. don‚Äôt ya come place literally see skyline one populous cities world, went one disastrous impacts whole thing? 

I‚Äôm really torn saying anything discomfort this. feel irresponsible. say wanted drive, way wanted take flight, particularly NYC. thought imparted felt, also made difference. someone young asthma health issues makes happy. first sure get vaccinated studies showing actually safety vaccine changed mind. also group first people get vaccination.

Guess though? idiots United States saying shit AGAIN! went SUMMER. good news.

This ridiculous dumb. Cerk (COVID jerk)? profitable. Jesus doesn‚Äôt cause issues thing.  No, I'm fascinated fixated following around.

I noticed began stalking me. seven hospitals *in* Li√®ge: Looking voter turnout far, I'm first proud Americans, also kinda worried election might super-spreader event. auto-immune reaction side effect respiratory infection.

Of course, auto-immune sounds like something (if weak!) rather something done us - suits Herd Mentalists. thought countries fabulous healthcare infrastructures!? 

For shit America receives, orthopedic surgery 6 days accident. doctor willing next fucking day decline due scheduling reasons.

But please, go bad healthcare system is. press release (HealthDay)‚Äî**Nerve damage vocal cords could reason people recovering COVID-19 suffer mysterious bouts shortness breath months shaking coronavirus**, researchers say.

Vocal cords meant constrict across airway talking, vibrating air moving past create sound voice.

When talking, vocal cords retract allow air freely flow lungs.

But, **in patients, COVID-19 appears damage nerve regulates speech, causing vocal cords impede breathing even talking**, said Dr. Jonathan Aviv, ear, nose throat specialist Mount Sinai Hospital New York City.

""Think chit-chatting. Every time finish sentence, vocal cords open take breath,"" Aviv said. ""Imagine open. third fourth sentence, feel short breath. airway's closed.""

**The good news sort breathing problem easily treated common speech therapy technique**, Aviv said.

In recent paper International Journal Pulmonary &amp; Respiratory Sciences, Aviv colleagues said successfully treated 18 former COVID-19 patients combination speech therapy diet modification‚Äîavoiding foods might exacerbate nerve irritation.

""All patients resolve shortness breath. see come back. vocal cords moving normally,"" Aviv said.

The vagus nerve runs brain controls voice, swallowing, breathing coughing, Aviv said. Previous research shown vagus nerve injury cause vocal cords fail retract, impeding air flow.

""If vagus towel-snapped virus, going function normally, one manifestations shortness breath without cough,"" Aviv said.

Doctors confounded occasional COVID-19 patients continue shortness breath even though inflammation caused viral infection gone away imaging scans show lasting lung injury, said Dr. Joseph Khabbaza, pulmonologist Cleveland Clinic Ohio.

""We're seeing bunch people normal breathing tests responding asthma inhalers,"" Khabbaza said. ""They've got real symptoms testing coming normal.""

To see vocal cords might culprit, Aviv colleagues ran tiny camera smaller shoelace noses 18 COVID-19 ""long haulers"" get closer view airway.

Sure enough, camera showed people's vocal cords failing pull back properly.

""I show video, basically fall examining chair. cannot believe what's going on,"" Aviv said.

This sort vocal cord dysfunction treated using ""respiratory retraining,"" series exercises designed improve function respiratory muscles, Aviv said.

Aviv also urged patients avoid highly acidic foods irritate vagus nerve, including flavored beverages cans bottles, citrus fruits, tomato sauce, vinegar wine.

COVID-19 patients continue persistent shortness breath even symptoms faded discuss possibility doctor, Aviv suggested.

After reading Aviv's paper, Khabbaza said couple patients plans check possible vocal cord problems.

""If stuck shortness breath, think sounds like something worth investigating know responds well speech therapy,"" Khabbaza said. ""This vagal neuropathy would one things would cause shortness breath respond common treatments shortness breath COVID infection."" Nanotechnology basically large molecules - Tony Stark level technology. Ok too. special! useless since beginning pandemic. stopped listening beginning said masks necessary- social distancing hand washing.
Yea Tam, respiratory illness already known contracted droplets aerosols. get medical degree basic understanding physics chemistry? f*cking cereal box? flatter check vaccine news times day. guys know US sustained period 1,200 deaths day past 15 years cigarettes, right? Fast food bit dangerous. Now, standby I'll get along with! saw study refers new strain Covid spreading Spain; already EU states Britain well.

Maybe that's old news y'all mention underline we're years away immunity. Anyone makes claims succumbing frankly neoliberalism pressure treat natural phenomena static order justify continuing business usual without interruption.

The spread new variant likely thanks pressures reopen International borders markets waaay soon... Where's Michael Scott Ron Paul need them? Congratulations. enthusiastic stalker. think heard SD governor stating people thanking proving there's difference states locked hers. That's opinion - personally, hope never wear fucking mask life. You‚Äôre wrong. Protests spread virus. don‚Äôt believe listen mayor Dr Ferrer. 

Bye. currently waving corner room **Don't worry everyone! good authority covid-19 magically disappear hours!!** Man hope JB wins tonight dorks like go back go obsessed craft beer board games instead US politics.  Li√®ge. think it‚Äôs last point makes difficult gather data. People eat out, even outside, likely also lot stupid shit, it‚Äôs hard know stupid things led infected. may strongly suspected cases come eating difficult prove. one model persistently wrong everything start. That's basing numbers on.

!remind 2 months. wish death people. However, people die, less upsetting virus denying non mask wearing asshats. Waving Ohio Ouch, sorry. moved South found school system Merit Scholarship level lower score medians moved first grade. think people outside south appreciate horrible school system (mostly). Fixing fashion would radically reform American south east. mom anti-vaxxer kept getting form take home provide school vaccination records years kinda gave up. Makes wonder made fake form. PRESIDENT‚ÄôS ACTIONS, American lives STATE matter. I'm surprised Germany spiking bad good handle it. Fun little scenario you: Asthma. smoker vicinity. smoker doesn‚Äôt care affects health makes hard breath. smoker properly educated affects him. Smoker takes action try quit.   That's problem STEM fields dominated men. goes research diseases largely affect People Color like sickle cell. Yes. It‚Äôs called election phase. economy country let run wild? false start argument. 

Pretending economy would magically fine nothing naive best, deceptive worst depending pushing it. Consumer confidence goes toilet people feel safe afraid contracting virus control.

Most world, particularly Australia sitting giant credit bubble binge global leaders decided kick road 2008. economy already flat lining COVID-19 hit (low wage growth, record personal debts, record low interest, massive inflation housing prices etc) brought things forward, obviously outcomes great freaking pandemic. I'll choose less dead people recession, rather lots dead people recession. Uninteresting? fascinate way crash might? **I can't wait covid-19 hours!!!**

/s never said that, Mr. Strawman. interesting question ponder, maybe abstract scenario, rather something might presented US hospital system goes rails. I'd supportive taking American patients extent can. nobody cares. Good luck! get 2,000. Stuped Merica first recession almost 30 years, however already path, especially bushfires, fault Covid lockdown think anyone paying attention expecting happen even pandemic. full effect lockdown seen time, particularly certain Covid-specific welfare ends next year.

But could worse. one thing, Victoria second lockdown better entire country to, least. keep numbers stay top hotel quarantine, people afraid go back normal either, help. may great, hey, could worse. Ask next bushfire season.. JFC, people understand money worth resulting deaths?!?! Yes, indoors big part weather effect. sun belt, got hot summer, people stayed indoors used A/C, also lowers humidity. Broken record, based ‚Äúeducated‚Äù responses.
On Reddit.
In comment section.
No less.

Being serious Reddit bit stretch. Well, yea, conservatives tend way selfish. honestly every single issue. sort proof conservatives bad society? Like you, wanting bring entire world halt stop living amazing life given improbable chance, avoid tiny chance death. Which, inevitably find anyways.

Yikes. cooperation never helps anyone.

Good know.  would explain Trump essentially spent lifetime losing father's money.

Narcissism win! I'm sure scary?

The US already point many months, Covid really concentrated cities opposed spread across whole country. Reminder that, definition, half people average (100) IQ. lot dummies there. line. line. live Chicago. ‚Äú2 week quarantine‚Äù completely unenforceable unless tell someone broke it. policy becomes herd immunity


If... Surgical masks best get here, lots gaps sides. perfectly efficient filtering outgoing breath, good intake. Lol shove sun shine, January 1st I'm living like tomorrow. Enough enough. vaccine coming. Dare go see himself. Watch excuses comes with.

I love bet people like ridiculous amounts money they're right. Suddenly, want make easy buck... Biker Gang Cosplay lmao learned ambulance workers warned wear medical gloves longer 10 minutes gloves increase vulnerability skin.

When I'm wearing (regular) gloves, notice prevent touching face.

Masks supposed protect others. heard claims they'd nothing protect they'd something protect - believe much unless wear correctly (washing/disinfecting hands handling it) combination face shield. el paso beg people take precautions like week two ago.

I'm guessing go well. saying wont get prority, going use available anyone else. superintendent schools told us adults giving adults kids giving kids :/ aware Trump invented concept cost-benefit analysis. Yeah, official CDC numbers us averaging one 9/11 worth DEATHS every 2-3 days.

Wake fuck up. Yup.

I live australia - population density looks insane. Except isnt. live packed together.

Every single time talk covid here, mouth breather brings up.........population density. get you‚Äôre saying even used reckoning walking outside, one day happened neighbor‚Äôs dog snuck rushed me. grab dog‚Äôs collar walk back neighbor‚Äôs front door hand dog back her. 
It totally random unexpected. neighbor 60 mother lives 80ish.

I wearing mask glad could protect neighbor‚Äôs household return dog.

This long way saying despite best laid plans sometimes you‚Äôll closer people anticipated. Maybe good way remove ambiguity disputes ready case. Tomorrow gonna scary numbers Yeah that‚Äôs happening.

Do though?  sure seem like it. 99% agree you. think another aspect a) government officials want believe real b) even engaging wishful thinking. saying honest sort implies knew real answer want tell us, think willing belive realistic answer themselves.

In mid-March, Moderna recruiting vaccine trial participants live. signed trial, obligated periodic follow-up health check visits 14 months getting first shot. saw [Derek saying guessing 18 months vaccines, surprised. (And pandemics vaccines, raged far longer that.)

I willing accept rough year half. I'm nerd; many people read stuff fun? Rural north Florida small town hospice thrift store. Local police officer, sitting inside door, reminding anyone trying enter must wear mask. aware active mask order locally, police think good idea. 40 crowd gather home instead. push people go party other's homes instead bar.  ask you, like this?  Good ! Enough shutdowns Governor Massachusetts difference ""nearly sure prevent infection"" vs ""hey still whole lot better nothing"". dealing **REALLY** contagious disease like measles *you absolutely cannot risk becoming sick*, N95 better filtration eyes mouth/nose way meet need (short supplied air respirator). However, COVID seem good aerosol transmission (meaning happens, work it) us full face respirator work-approved we're camp ""what that's better nothing"". Testing year shown home made masks reach high 70% filtration aerosols. 70% absolutely good enough scenario close contact infectious person long periods time. However, 70% absolutely enough make difference population-scale outcomes (basically bad healthcare system gets slammed) casual/short term contacts (passing line, picking take-out food, etc) infectious. *70% still makes less likely get sick*, nearly impossible like proper PPE would be. ""Nearly impossible"" required healthcare settings. ""Better nothing"" us achieve daily lives.

Wear damned mask. SARS-CoV-2 seems damned good droplet transmission even poor masks really help that. S-C-2 seems kind ok aerosol transmission home made masks still help least that. Add together mask really mean less likely get sick. happening UK. weekend cases started dropping. Looks like lower level measure's enough, need affect infections 22 days prior case. Hong Kong far, far higher population density yet far, far lower infection rate.  Herd immunity overwhelming health care impossible course action. completely ruin country also killing lot people.

I calculated numbers Germany. 3.5 years, 7500 deaths month, hard social distancing limits compensate many people infected, many people spread. tyranny

You idea tyranny is.

Wearing mask like smallest, insignificant inconvenience also one biggest things help protect others yourself.

You wear form clothing too, also ""tyranny""? Unemployment definitely available them. Probably it‚Äôs Muse they‚Äôre 10 years past prime.. I'm debating science behind this, agree - there. I'm calling tantrum mis-classification form oppression.

You made clear points here, downvoted acting like child. Today wife told we're expecting third. Great timing, this. 4 year old wearing mask 6.5 hours day school 2 months complaints. He's actually excited put mask goes somewhere. 

People really need stop assuming children can't wear masks. Yeah think that's one additional level removed contact CDC guidelines talk about, according need to. unusual reason to, could quarantine choice guess (e.g. want visit elderly grandparent, etc.). Eff that. cancelled Thanksgiving Florida trip. worth risk. I'll stay Buffalo NY freeze ass go anywhere vacation. think know Doctor wife? nurses working Covid worked patients WW1? sarcastic, thinking since post. 4 * humans naturally social suffer depression loneliness self isolation
5 * lot people can't get right amount/drive exercise self isolating

""Children following conditions might increased risk severe illness: obesity, medical complexity, severe genetic disorders, severe neurologic disorders, inherited metabolic disorders, sickle cell disease, congenital (since birth) heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, **asthma chronic lung disease**, immunosuppression due malignancy immune-weakening medications."" 

The data children COVID great far, conditions shown increase risk severe illness adults, much information assume kids.  It‚Äôs curious collective governments managed pump billions banks 2008 siphoned make rich richer, unable provide kind level financial support everyone else suffering it‚Äôs almost like don‚Äôt care. Lockdowns cause way damage coronavirus. Every 1% increase unemployment associated 30,000 death. Lockdowns destroy small businesses elite businesses prosper. CARES act single greatest upward transfer wealth human history. Case numbers inflated misusing pcr test high cycle threshold, causes death misattributed Covid. go lockdowns. disaster. anyone support draconian measures baffles me. I'm willing estimate 25% people see masks wearing improperly. One gent today low strap dangling chin. Technically mask face, unlikely stopping much particulate. Air less capacity absorb moisture cooler. breathe, expel moisture lungs. warm wet air breathe hits cold dry air moisture condenses visible fog dissipates breath ""cloud"" expands dissolves larger volume ambient air.

So guess easily aerosolized sense moisture droplets squeezed breath due cold air. I'm really shooting dark here... really post something said masks cause cancer? article pictures partying... It‚Äôs many people go public assuming able social distance reality run people. eliminates ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd run anyone‚Äù excuse hear time walking stairs getting elevator apartment complex. 6ft apart outdoor pretty much safe... one study 7300 cases, 1 case outdoor, means outdoor accounts 0.01% covid Thank international perspective. sure ""glad"" right word it, ever slightly less embarrassing know alone. Wisconsin DUIs/drunk driving. Totally preventable yet tragically regular. Well great, looks like people sane then. town several outbreaks among retail/restaurant workers. often live packed multigenerational/extended households (Hawaii) cannot afford work.  Initially anti mask protests protests stay home orders, people asking others go back work serve them, like hair dressers, rather service workers themselves. wealthier it. careful amount- toxicity happen. probably enforced though, least outdoors. Cops better things stop random people forgetting wear mask staying 50 feet away others. Fuck, someone works grocery store bunch assholes wear masks makes depressed... spent 15 mins mansplaining doctor wife infectious diseases. Honestly, low risk.  ignoring people adequately addressed concerns? people calling BS economic control covid. worth it? Kinda far absolutely not. monetary aid EXTREMELY difficult get

Damn sorry hear. Make sure chase amount, it‚Äôs separate one time $1200 stimulus check money getting April July. think supposed temporary $300 extra per week result executive order well. 

Government completely mishandled this. little prevent spread undermine science medicine. hope get money man, deserve it, us, you, me, everybody paid taxes specifically government could step emergency situations like help people   nickel every time ran someone hallway stairwell apartment building immediately apologized mask ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd run someone‚Äù I‚Äôd wealthy man.

Staying locked inside high energy kids, can't go Arizona still 100 outside November. can't fault anyone cracking, losing sanitization sanity point role US military logistics, ability manufacturer privately developed vaccine large quantities able get already established hospital system quickly. US military best equipped logics system world, use greater good. Haha yo beer them. Best chicken I‚Äôve ever had. You‚Äôre right. also depends concentration. populated city. I‚Äôm willing bet mushy brain country. world go outside one around 8 miles scenario risking anything. 

Walking around Boston NY SF completely different mountains West Virginia coast Maine wherever they‚Äôre from. IFR may low 0.3-0.4% summer, though that's probably lower bound. UK ONS surveillance testing, combined deaths get rolling IFR rate. pretty good article it.

In spring would surely much higher. Daegu outbreak 2.35% CFR - claimed case parents 80-85% cases, could mean 1.8% IFR. Serology NYC (20-25% 0.33% population dying) would put IFR around 1.5% there. serology studies UK, Belgium, NL, Spain also 1-1.5% range. recently-published spring serology [from puts lower, around 0.9%.

Okay, that's bigger range 2x. guess think IFR around 0.7%, maybe could 2x higher lower that. still lot lower range we've seen case counting.

Knowing range case undercounting hard, obviously. We've seen CFR's low 1% recently, would argue 3x undercounting; I've assuming closer 2x positivity 2-4% range. course places testing done undercounting complete.

There really nice math analysis done pattern cases positivity spring, judged undercounting varied 3x 20x. found highly convincing range, though trust specific location. cannot find link though.

The idea IFR vary even really worrisome. never got good IFR estimates Italy, place significant percentage old people that's every large enough outbreak really make medical system useless. Even serology ended 4.4% (estimated 1.2% IFR, though hard know exactly numbers use either numerator denominator). many places Lombardy 1% population died March - others much lower impact, Lombardy whole 3 *months* extra deaths (comparable mortality rate NYC) currently seeing cases rise double weekly. phase 1 soooo 2nd quarter 2020 Come on. pro mask, put one even Fauci recommended them. make judgement necessary. Indoors always, crowded spaces always, walking around block fresh air easily cross road see someone. 

And no, isn‚Äôt piece cloth, piece cloth face. face use communicate connect human beings. saying isn‚Äôt justified, don‚Äôt pretend ‚Äújust piece cloth‚Äù either. much that. Two divided political parties can‚Äôt even agree help people. 
Wasn‚Äôt 1,200$ check sent June? June seems like years ago Reminds classic Blackadder scene:

German captor: ""Prepare fate worse death, English flying fellow. try escape suffer even worse!"" 

Blackadder: ""A fate worse fate worse death?"" Yes still cost billions billions per year like flu. people handle contextual decision-making well, opens door mistakes. 'seatbelt going X mph going X miles start location' law 'put on, period' simplicity enforceability's sake. probably know wear mask, there's element discretion instead blanket ruling, gotta rely EVERYBODY know (and also act good faith) that's...not responsibility everyone equipped for. apparently.

besides, someone MA, get enforced strictly anyway. we've variations theme since start, Baker's called 'No Balls' nothing. theater makes look proactive, despite dropping...after Halloween Salem. tyranny, regular ol posturing. realise issue example *drink-driving* *drinking* right? people actually ban drink driving basically everywhere across world? scientific evidence suggest elevated spread hours particular reason? Thats amazing! wonder causes vaccines underproduced time. thing would comparing Biden rallies Trump rallies.

A protest heavily masked (when police ripping masks confiscating masks handed out), comprised mostly people took pandemic seriously actively took precautions, many quarantined after, stand injustices poc facing, time oppressions impacted frequently poc died pandemic, us unmasked Trump rally. know this. ignoring facts make false comparison. issues equal. playing devils advocate spreading misinformation. arrest fine fuckers parties 20-50+. stop punishing everyone else. arent military. pushups someone else fucked up. get sick, pose danger. That's problem. neighborhood quiet, good you, less danger, reality stands lower risk even choose comfort. biggest concern children spreading family members others general. actual death numbers absolutely huge. 300,000+ partying equate well balanced?  go patting back hard there. rest orders lackluster. instance, indoor dining close earlier, capacity limited. 

A lot restrictions weirdly focused around curfews, sucks really make sense. I've running night reliably avoid people streets empty. positive see deter parties, wonder effective be. like people can't party 10PM. matter...must get cogs capitalism machine moving! C'mon man! didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs mass may know he‚Äôs Republican Bible, I'm guessing. actually takes quite bit time cremate body. 

They stored cremated. WHO. Expert. Pick one. Massive birthday Halloween party quite close together. Didn‚Äôt even learn first party bullshit actions are. family yuck. Must nice whatever want repercussions.  Well every fall viruses flus illnesses start crop up. Without fail. extrapolate COVID parents live 10 mins away, sometimes like sit backporch them, 6 ft apart, wear masks talk. times BYOB, lol. able hug hold hand specifically miss. work home, unfortunately, jobs make come office. RONA CARE TIME ! 7 cases 9 days 700 July

Let‚Äôs go easing restrictions must democrat behavior? Refusing wear mask can't infect people? familiar germ theory? actually understand viruses work spread around? Thankfully audience looks pictures read posts Except trump announces vaccine. American politicians question whether trust vacine. Whether like vacine coming soon. American politicians love political rather scientific. wouldve quit job soon found wasnt provided PPE.  I'm gonna trust experts Probably count number people store. places might automatically sensors. local grocery store comes intercom state many people currently store, idea get info seen anyone counting, maybe automatically counting security cameras?  start telling truth pretending actually investigation. non-negative thoughts new normal could look like. Intellectually know people like owner. bigger part understand. Live world fear like, many countries beat pandemic keeping restaurants economy open. Focusing remain open safe priority, wearing masks, socially distancing, reducing restaurant capacity contact tracing better results closing business.  Totally. live mid-Atlantic city. areas totally unremarkable mask anywhere, areas would make object suspicion among armed imbeciles. anything, still. every person decides go early avoid people. would look that. Two days later 30,000 daily cases. look foolish. See 12 days. tone never go back way ominous

without sounding like conspiracist, media know scary quoting things like that, gets clicks can't help think I'm alone street masking unnecessary I'm jumping shadows, wear it. hand, inconvenience even tiny tiny chance could save life life family, wear it. really necessary people see they'll think I'm weird. hard enough time socializing people, want neighbors think I'm weird...

These things brain keeps going back forth go walk days COVID. Trump ordered Mnuchin stop working Pelosi. PSC bipartisan ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù committee. ‚ÄúSenate‚Äù refused even talk new stimulus push SCOTUS election year, like said wouldn‚Äôt misleading? headline factual doesn‚Äôt contradict anything said. 
That lot good work doesn‚Äôt mean trust every aspect, particularly related China. Read whole article, short PPE reported new?  cover academic report published October *Reads article* 

Is really necessary edgy it? Good I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm going wear mask outside I‚Äôm running early morning. well 10 feet away anyone whenever tried run mask times, stamina, training suffered greatly. Running keeping sane thing. Yes, work government state laws regarding workplace exposure. Many places passed similar laws. state requires anyone could exposed notified requires quarantining returning work. Based what? studies show someone socially distant middle park risk infection?  Someone walking alone trail mask on?

It literally making case anti-maskers claim it‚Äôs govt overreach. past normal dead discovering new normal look like. Working home office jobs likely permanent number cases (that genie going stuffed back bottle...too many people like much, proven solid work without micromanagement). profound effects. 

-- Retail demand downtown cores plummet time driven suburbs. may drive creation local pockets retail restaurants rather destination shopping experiences. 

-- local retail restaurants may lead less congestion all, need everyone travel en masse one direction, may simply accessible bike foot. 

-- Networking also change. longer simply networking within company, time get know people neighbourhood network them. Job growth opportunities increase. 

-- lack commute may also free parents spend time children. may thus less demand school care children gain time free play among neighbourhood kids. greater knowledge people neighbourhood may inspire parents allow children greater freedom explore well, confident watchful eyes helping protect them. 

-- Increased demand retail suburbs also helps retail workers, opportunity work community reap benefits commute. may reduce traffic, leading less pollution. Perhaps local ecosystem starts heal small ways. 

This prophecy, infinite number things could happen. one example new normal COULD look like post-pandemic...the choices make near future shape end with. bad can, fact, markedly better. ScoMo literally border closures? state premiers decision Yeah, that‚Äôs way feel speed limits dui. Good point. Snow white? like really obvious wanted wear mask want wear mask. anxiety make decision. Making decisions mentally taxing. thing. studied. Now, someone made decision me. That's one less thing decide.""

The ‚Äúillusion‚Äù safety become ‚Äúreality‚Äù vaccine becomes available ‚Äúsacrifices‚Äù people Melbourne made worth it. Keep suspected cases room away family give bathroom too! (Edit: joking possible thought advice would people follow. never joke wasn‚Äôt clear.)  Mr. cells buddy.... might scare someone, best mask ü§£
Why thread one giant circle-jerk? 

Everyone's validating much makes sense obstruct breathing reprogram ability evaluate risk. 

This empirically pandemic. happening comments? Deterring parties 100% point curfews. research Spain recently determined smallish house parties primary agent spread thats leading back harsher lock downs despite public policy remained strict.

Its fucking shitty, shitty people causing real death unenforceable order are, predictably, enforced. Curfews enforceable. Blanket mask requirements enforceable. hate it. can't trust people fucking bare minimum own. ...unless law, seems. People even pick choose epidemiologists listen to. ‚Äúinfectious disease doctors‚Äù saying lockdowns possibly wrong approach start. Go Australia üá¶üá∫!!  dude, it‚Äôs Russian vaccine, we‚Äôre talking private business decent country, wants force people take guinea pigs **then** ‚Äútake himself‚Äù ‚Äî don‚Äôt really think will. Ya situation can‚Äôt easily remove mucus-filled mask wipe mucus-glazed face, like business meeting. go rest meeting knowing knowing know there? leave that. mean sharted pants would sure leave right away change. kind feels like. Pretty seldom I've started period unexpectedly plenty times. would say mostly England, yes it‚Äôs fucking mess here. Difficult position here. drag feet people continue die. approve vaccine, could stifle future versions vaccine. S. Korea celebrates Halloween? ü§î I'm glad Australia New Zealand exist number reasons, least demonstrated public health mitigation measures Covid19 work outside East Asian cultural context. sure hell do. Viral slipstream, Google. wearing one, though, showed signs going put one got closer.

Why would she? ass clear side street ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Four months living working home.  That's individual countries. confirm. Yeah, get saying. fever last night like 10 pm. even broke morning 24 hours since he's without it. right idea happened here. ask people stay home, enforced allowed go 5km home get massive fine ($1600+) jail time repeat offenders.

. closed state borders protect rest country.

. offered free covid testing across state.

. offered financial assistance casual workers can't afford take time work.

. offered financial assistance business keep afloat.

. closed everything, except supermarkets, pharmacists. Everything else click collect.

. curfew catch idiots trying move around night.

. Anyone work home to, massive fines businesses comply.

. Mandatory masks everywhere, fines non compliance.

. Payments anyone lost job increased payments welfare.

. Comprehensive daily data modeling virus spreading across state, long would take contain measures relax first controlled fashion. Listening medical professionals rather business lobbies qanons like yourself.

I one grateful government took ""easy"" path rather letting run wild, incredibly hard know. thing is, needs besides refinement servers. deal Amazon away implemented world.

We infraestructure, way world set (with phones even ubiquitous people) is... Huge. Like, REALLY huge. could well mean end pandemic months.

I mentally prepared hunker 202, say I'm ""glass half empty"" person. brilliant glimmer hope world. Nurses new PPE People think vaccine cure this. Best case scenario we're back normal-ish 2 years. Worst case, 5. love make rules things. That's behavior actually makes sense. Canada bans US travelers allows transferring flights? 

So u got bunch people taking connections Canada? respect fellow man science. Spoken like guy whose sports teams got crushed Boston one point another. 

MA incredible state, bitter liberal. Yeah imma move away great economy, education, health care system wear mask sometimes. Ah see. work government offices company private. covid protocols made always reactive I'm sitting wondering managers/leadership step say anything ... button we've we've serious?  Easy, easy, need get parents back pickup ... Recently forced stores person understand comfort, many places good! said, parents risk, it, listen decently. 

They live hospital worker, they're already avoiding friends, tell step been. üòû hard them, miss activities. need brainstorm activities week seriously.  think fast, cheap, widespread, routine testing could help us economically socially vaccines effective. expect we‚Äôll still need masks, washing, stay outside keep distance practical though. Gotta love province. geographical equivalent beautiful-but-brainless trope. Yes 4 months imprisonment. live fine that's ok. I've enjoyed last four months freedom I'll definitely enjoy next four months. El Paso experienced COVID-19 flu's off-season (so far). 42X probably underestimate. Yes, live. It‚Äôs technically possible could win mega millions lottery too, yeah, indoor dining bullshit, reality say, follow money. numbers even read, let alone understand, sure supply them, cuz quite frankly, people piss-poor processing information. That's like indicating can't see anyone Fuck yeah! Melbourne! Love getting downvoted plague rats saying obvious shit like ""don't potentially asymptomatically breathe virus car's interior pick elderly person."" Haha minority. TBF cloth masks come statement something share class? Whenever group people decides virus inconvenient, virus explodes healthcare system overwhelmed government enforces lockdown. 

If don‚Äôt, would resort triage (only treat strongest, let rest die), patients spilling streets, eventually corpses piling outdoors, healthcare workers would strike. 

That‚Äôs majority Europe US states headed right now. going hard lockdown, trying delay that. region gives caution reverts scenario handful weeks later. 

It doesn‚Äôt help complain dislike it. It‚Äôs reality keeps beating us head again. That's assuming people tested ""you stupid fuckers"" know science. know majority people asymptomatic. Easy solution - wear mask. Sure, it‚Äôs like rule followed enforced. people wear masks continued so. people don‚Äôt continue flout policy. dunno, countries it...I'm sure America work something out...
And countries pretty much woods need sit home several years... month so. 

And would rather, government go debt, feasibly manage. personally go debt definitely can't manage (if even get loan)? 

The thing one country going this, every country is. I'm sure debt economies around world going need co-operate avoid ruin. 
The government vote helping citizens whole, making fend themselves. 

Lastly, I'm sure countries hugely debt sleep night knowing put price heads citizens keep incomes. kid cancer, sell house could cure them. can't government pay keep citizens alive? 

(Btw I'm fully expecting downvoted oblivion that's opinion. I'm America understanding skewed what's going overseas... I'm also probably going say silent think reply becoming bit antagonistic unproductive). obviously said white person care whatever Kardashian says, even know they're celebrities for. love named two relatively non-lethal unrelated things argument. yea LA huge. hills mountains provide plenty space get away live unbothered Rest peace every single person lost life coronavirus. Let's let deaths vain. Go vote, lives depend it. think is. They're probably planning tests per day, means need buy massive stock tests last while. Yeah unfortunately spot here. talking about????  course were. we've four days row (including today) **0 new cases**. Yes stupid want even try something helps countries.

I wear mask drive personal car see people wear it. know reason? Prob not! I'll tell you. wearing mask certain period time get used forget even wearing it.  stay vote Almost like isn‚Äôt real middle class. There‚Äôs upper class there‚Äôs rest us struggling everyday knowing one wrong step bankrupt us Just. Lol Trend isn‚Äôt great  bad posting Reddit? Got numbers that? Hope so- we've seen dozens dozens similar ""game changers"" past months never materialized anything useful communicate better? [In united 9.5 million confirmed covid cases 235 thousand deaths. **That's 2.5% mortality rate**.

235,000 / 9,500,000 = 0.025 = 2.5%.

You stupid fkrs idea even simple math. like wearing seatbelt car that‚Äôs parked talking wearing mask outside alone. say this, look countries like Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea even Germany impossible tasks become difficult, dirty possible task.

Germany, going second wave managed keep deaths per million 128 US 714 per million climbing fast. Why? trying, unlike US gave avoiding infection overwhelmed hospitals. *They live society.* friend said full ass lockdown since June. true? RINO. Trump sycophant. governs state get away it. technically possible much, much likely occur indoor dining still allowed. morgue overwhelmed too.  


Excuse sound like trying normalize avoidable emergency. So, still addressing statement prioritizing ""independence"" avoid needlessly crowding hospitals?

Or, honestly believe we're ""turning corner?"" lol less money. CDC says .1% death rate cases recorded. Many people science says asymptomatic. OAN worse Fox News could ever be.  quite literally Russian propaganda. want people jog mask on? CNN fear mongering hell wrong you. people getting started. week first day since april 5000 covid deaths every day. innings number two, dumb fkrs amongst looking collect winnings game. Hmmmm weeks majority kids go back school daily case rate reverses trend, going back up, plowed records. new hyper social environment nothing it...

CoRReLaTioN iSnT CauSaTiOn realize doctors specialize certain areas, right? Actually incidental exposure indoors pass on, doesn‚Äôt prolonged. Republicans carried 50+ year war education.  direct result that. Hard agree here. 9 million cases prove Americans try look exceptions, exemptions loopholes.

Good keep up! There's another option Canada pricey: come study university. Masters programs fully funded even international students, competitive. Technical colleges ton sports scholarships- sure getting yiu5into thr big leagues, might make affordable you. Otherwise pricey international student, often cheaper USA options anyway students, even international, get full health insurance coverage fees. Oh work here, often spouse get full open work visa too. Worth looking spouse earn enough pay fees living costs. 

After successfully completing degree diploma apply Graduate Visa program, length program study. time numerous paths residency open result. doable.

Immigration general rough - far harder realise. immigrant myself, though, love adopted nation much swear worth effort get - like dbumba said, easy. anything easy. worth it. Nah, observing.

I mind masks all, dumbest thing people discussing since pandemic started.

It's hard wear mask, hard think health people around is. People can't understand necessity measures ones I'm calling fragile. gamechanger. 


If works, could setup app, let user log daily, cough times phone, receive potential diagnostic 98% accuracy, non-invasive basically free manner. 


You could even whip up, cough decide based results whether want go dinner, family reunion.  


It's groundbreaking, say least. would say, toss old thing. lot current research question. lol... wtf level best? great job avoiding boris, heftier prolonged. govt done splendid job hmm yes, indeed reason merica fucked thousands dying. Good luck ..k bad Trump zero authority Fauci. stupid fkrs can't math.

[In united 9.5 million confirmed covid cases 235 thousand deaths. **That's 2.5% mortality rate**. Also life normal states? people telling there? Please, please go live another planet. Cases mass going up. Baker trying everything stop another shutdown. wearing masks outside cure covid? No. better nothing complaining see anyone else doing. Nonsensical? I'm nonsensical policy guess what? 0 positive test Charlie Baker orders? running Bakerstan? last checked people don‚Äôt take orders politicians. You‚Äôre absolutely right, don‚Äôt expect upvotes hive minded sub. listen science it‚Äôs convenient propagate fear. literal dozen viruses might inhale infected passerby jogger cause infection. It‚Äôs viral load. shut indoor eating drinking everywhere tomorrow 100% indoor properly fitted mask compliance next month, covid would gone. Wearing mask outdoors it‚Äôs cold? excellent face warmer. live United States .1% death rate also. ü§¶ goes back question: making everyone shop groceries narrow window time encourage social distancing? make sense. working day mask becomes moist touch readjust every 10 minutes continue touching everything tools doorhandles back readjusting moist mask... safe less safe? end touching face also touching wet mask touching everything else. 


I see little benefit mask working construction -10 look forward moving goalposts. Kind like supposed go away Easter school- yes, PE. students social distance PE recess, required keep mask times. Yep work field requiring extremely low rates failure [multiple layers redundancy key. Expecting person act proactively protect sounds like great idea except I've watched person wearing mask correctly pull mask way (in crowd, less) sneeze comfortably... weird Mad Libs going here? false positive better false negative matter Frances growth rate covid insane. good reason lockdown.  Trump stated plans fire Fauci election. Yup. There‚Äôs reason STEM workers flock Europe Canada US. California, Texas, North Carolina. Take pick. You‚Äôll get paid states good tech job countries another good one recently marine engineer infected working ships two different ports. traced filipino crew flown depart first ship already left. crew second ship still New Zealand tested negative. information passed Australian government crew tested arrival Brisbane, never followed see got genomic confirmation. 

We also significant outbreak August killed three people, never determined origin. Genomic testing confirmed cases part cluster. even traced one transmission two people catching bus. Contact tracers identified particular church services resulted outbreaks. even teenager visited member opposite sex disclose contact tracers figured out. 

It's interesting. Let's listen science here. crowded street market, wear mask

If walking path street low density people constantly moving, fine. interesting experiment follow. manage root majority cases way continue keep cases down, countries might follow suit. lie. local township hall cast absentee ballot, nobody behind counter police station mask on. must think immune plexiglass barrier us them. Sounds like big contracts big tech companies, like war terror patriot act style surveillance. govt also said surveillance ""bc care you"". Anyone thinks good intentions tracking extremely naive. right privacy important anyone says otherwise something want you. 

And neither places contact tracing. seem necessary. like govt corporations run marketing campaigns stirring fear terrorism bc actuality unlikely terrorist kills you. Positivty rate climbing meaning undertesting.  see Denmark thing? find 25% spring hospitalization peak Yo completely unrelated election hard move Scotland? Good point, mom voted republican 30+ years voting Biden year. it‚Äôs 50/50 I‚Äôd say. seems like good chunk people don‚Äôt care anymore. ""With days go, Florida failed spend $10 million designated election security, COVID-19 protection polls surge mailed ballots.

A large piece pie $3.5 million Secretary State Laurel Lee requested Legislature earlier year state‚Äôs 67 county supervisors elections shore systems.

The counties ask money. remains unspent, sitting state account ""unbudgeted reserve.""

Another chunk pie left plate $6 million CARES Act funds 19 counties decided take advantage of, could used make polling places safer voters hire extra people count mail-in ballots.""

Things going largely according plan. That‚Äôs exactly right. State government policy dictated scientific experts. modelling used turned incredibly accurate we‚Äôre exactly track model predicted. 

At federal level, generous benefits provided anyone non-essential job couldn‚Äôt work restrictions. 

It hard. Home schooling three months brutal, better scenario seen US Europe now. Brief lockdowns don‚Äôt shit highly contagious virus vaccine. OAN Federal Network Starship Troopers true. second lockdown started July 9 strict aspects curfew 5km radius Aug 2. June many restrictions. No. first reply tossed insults entertain it. seem little civil maybe calmed down. Although still passive-aggressive. learn engage people better civil.

Yes, idea behind shutdowns, flatten curve staggering number hospital. However, can't keep economy closed viable COVID going away anytime soon. 

Most people get COVID end ICU do. contagious small percentage ends larger number, important look number people ICU instead total number cases.

In areas, hospitals close capacity all. There's reason continue shut moment areas.

I care many cases are, many new cases, look many hospital high risk take extra caution. hard part

It‚Äôs like statewide 15 mph speed limit

Listen hate anti maskers lot

Hate bad / dumb governance guess comment border policies? Besides islands course.

For example Japan allow anyone except short list countries, even residency permit.

All countries put travelers managed isolation. closed borders China early year Europe still admitted Chinese tourists. Ah yes Island 1000km away nearest landmass fair comparison. agree choice lock great one NZ, doesn‚Äôt mean would apply everywhere else, especially EU. 

NZ handled pandemic best way possible given geographical position. rightfully made decision lock get rid virus entirely knew would comparatively easy stop getting back country. apply Europe, would rely rest continent exact same, also keeping borders completely locked stop refugees getting spreading again.

Lockdowns Europe serve different purpose. meant reduce spread health services cope gets hand. aren‚Äôt meant eliminate spread isn‚Äôt possible given geographic constraints.

Props NZ though. government handled perfectly. Working remote till summer might reviewed. That's office's take. Yes like started bastards stayed home. one went Walmart shopped. Yes everyone stay home Victorian government assess industry work could operate safely. much complicated telling people stay home.

Have even done 1% research happened Victoria? seem idea actually went down. Coronavirus caused common cold infections common asia, less common EU pretty rare US. think might reading different article. one seem back we're talking about. answered question said options times. seem vocal even local state boards. Living place threat virus disappeared months, new normal feels lot like old normal. Indeed working home sticks companies, perhaps chefs etc permanently wearing masks job, whole new world. think places harder time controlling this, would remain societal trauma sorts, like war without war, something Im sure manifest least paying party helps economy. research appeared International Journal Environmental Research Public Health

Global USA County Scale Analysis Weather, Urban Density, Mobility, Homestay, Mask Use Oh understand people forgetting. Hell I've forgotten made store realized forgot put mask on. There's gas station road one wearing mask. Cashiers customers without. Even cashiers walking around store nobody bothers social distancing. also like last gas station highway 20 miles imagine traffic. tell locals travelers travelers wearing masks. Dude, need spending waaaaay less time internet. information processing skills necessary validate information viewing. hospitals saturated

What headlines reading? midwest fucked right now. understand. Yes totally believe undercounted least 10x. statement read New York infection mortality rate certainly much higher global average due overloaded health system. 

My point data sample used estimate true numbers. read New York serology studies time main critique sampling people visiting grocery stores, suspect major sampling bias people visiting grocery stores pandemic probably likely infected. Also know sensitivity/specificity tests hard measure accurately, especially novel infection. 

I'm trying claim anything numbers particular, trying discuss way scientific data interpreted. go fuck themselves. correlation mask mandates rates. Europe strictest rules even worse. absurd think get rid virus primitive solutions like isolation moist cloth wearing day. terrible children disabled make quality life way lower. 9 people died today. 9. even know disease still existed 24/7 corporate fear mongering Fuck guy. wants think covid somehow stops spreading pay parties. private parties, says. go beer buds bar! could proven zero, people *actually putting masks well entering enclosed spaces*, course not.

But long beneficial medically behaviorally, done.

Why asking stupid question? bad order, demanding much people may opposite effect. ""This much, wear all"". Well instincts really, really bad That‚Äôs pull mask Yes, flu. also plague. know like live impossible isolate many vulnerable people Australia. elderly often require following week: someone come shower times, someone drop meds over, someone prepare give meals, doctor appointments need person. need isolate people providing services well. time hear people say ""just isolate elderly"" realise idea elderly live. practical, even little bit.

Secondly Victoria winter summer. spent nearly winter spring locked down. That‚Äôs ass backwards though Good! People often seem confuse 3 feet 6 feet..  Look, understandable grasp straws times, leadership, likely could easily overlook misstep; comes back failure failure ways last 8 months.

This corruption looks like.  Can't catch US though. can, anyone half brain knows he's also updated stance matter, publicly repeatedly. So... it'd much effect article posted.

Because they're saying thing.

And also really dumb. going hit maybe 70 single day 4 days 60s. going cold. science, friend. follow politicians, they're lying pieces shit. nonsensical policy indoor dining, casino gambling, person schooling continues Mass guess people downvoting know software engineers US paid roughly 2x salary software engineers Europe. Pretty much emphasize distinction people care make mistakes others simply don‚Äôt give shit.

It‚Äôs distinction finding difficult thread want absolutely clear see difference case changed view. Nice hear that. haven‚Äôt heard message before. kids still participate PE classes going school? still social distance? feeling they're going move goalpoasts keep making us wear masks even vaccine widely deployed? outdoors transmission negligible? Would still want enforce masks even useless? oh follow comment chain fully. ya warrens till 2025. thought wanted put another dem term already law. Europe compliance issues? know USA bike rally massive spike cases across Midwest. spike seems happening everywhere though Can‚Äôt argue criticisms all. Trump another league. summer, 40% infections happening happening abroad. People landing Germany could simply walk home one checking them. Thinking someone thought good idea go vacation Mallorca going self isolate two weeks back naive best.

We needed actual managed isolation like every country stopped covid does, maybe late now. flu vaccine efficacy 45%, majority human race absolutely doomed COVID-19. Welcome Elysium. must remember Sweden got hit hardest viral load Nordic countries. vast majority people died far infected Denmark Norway announced lockdowns. fact lot Swedes go skiing Alps every winter, Danes don‚Äôt ski much Norwegians mostly ski Norway. 

I‚Äôm denying acting like Denmark Norway would better choice, regardless locked death toll would significantly higher Denmark Norway. 

I‚Äôd love mask mandate right now. wear one flu season pandemic, probably work and/or go confirmed illness. Prevents infecting others, common sense common court6 You‚Äôre best. Thank much! ""Tall Deval""  Huh? Boomers like ‚ÄúBut kids can‚Äôt get covid?!‚Äù LOOOOOL!  Open windows every day period time (30 min+) help prevent virus buildup. Use humidifier. Use saline nose spray. Take vitamin supplements. Stay home can. contact tracing sound like you? I'm Northern England wrangling money parts North told tier 3 restrictions. government fought hard fund 80% salaries. feeling South plunged restrictions everyone else government found money.

I strong opinion completely overshadowed absolute mess we're in, understand Welsh would feel resentment. Even middle forest yourself? Get real sometimes fox put token guests speak trump lol...just like msnbc puts token guests speaking biden... sanitizing packages washing hands afterwards?  lol. post Fauci video too?? There‚Äôs ton don‚Äôt feel like feeding troll. Keep watching CNN sheep lmao will, elections years away fragile be? Lol. live country 0 cases month+ now. mask times. hot humid one bitches. God. wealthiest zip codes around country vote blue absolutely correct. flip side republicans biden - left party well (me included). polls margin error usually 3.5% per candidate - 7% two candidates. pollsters job line expect better assessment math math. Note Clinton‚Äôs loss within margin error polls - rule thumb absolute law. conspiracist. News media devil incarnate. time party, party hard. Pretty well. Georgia Sweden mandates rates lower. never mask mandate this?! Damn covids moving list. Narrator: ""It's bad Spanish Flu."" Sadly read full order, people health conditions exempt. can‚Äôt ask proof. Sigh. Better try enforcing full time mask rule wrong alternative 

No. it‚Äôs not. that‚Äôs difference people like people care living lives way want actually called local police complained cops standing around construction sites without masks. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting Like never forgot car? left hurry? small, simple, forgettable, albeit powerful tool forget.

Once wrong police handing face masks determining need make arrest? questions. envy. wish politicians would done something similarly effective.

greetings austria. would suggest?

Fines? Arrests? round anyone willing wear mask shoot them?

Where draw line, enforced? UK police good place due cutbacks years, barely see cop beat anymore outside violent areas.

Would suggest forming seperate entity like littering? Able distribute fines much else? would combat issues already arisen this? 

Or enjoying morale high ground pretend sit on, judging offering reasonable alternative.  Alexa cough cough. Imagine alexa would lock point. 

Or make doorbell certain color people see someone inside positive. we're completely ignoring science moved psycological tactics. Charlie who? not? Cases rising, deaths increasing, transmission upward trend... *something*! guy, fuck doing? Wearing mask outside, alone like wearing condom bed you‚Äôre single. /s, tell. mask wouldn‚Äôt anything one way another scenario? Lmao Hmm like herd immunity doesnt work. Oh, one's easy! medical officer plain-clothes approach every patient coming ask sure masks correctly. Anyone refuses wear mask get care! articles aren‚Äôt saying it‚Äôs spreading schools 

They‚Äôre saying schools aren‚Äôt primary driver pandemic Clearly beginnings Fomor invasion. Someone give accorded nations ring. Madrid cancelled surgeries month ago still change, shocker tremendous, perfect grave! would know, I've done graves president, except maybe Andrew Jackson. residential street, sidewalks. walking street either side it. Thing is, parked cars sides street point walking next might've come uncomfortably close six feet limit (that hug cars).

I idea actually worried, put mask ease anxiety, concerned me. see many people street go walking, lot see seem care we're pandemic. want worry might come talk closer six feet anything like that.

So put mask signal - cared - know we're pandemic I'm going anything endanger health child.

More likely signaled I'm ""nut"" ""sheep"" wears mask outside need to, like bunch people telling thread night (apparently). 

Yes, overthink things. There's possibility I'm autistic. way overthink things, especially social situations, correct instincts navigate naturally. still take first, wait there's doses everyone else. Making friends. I've 25 years need fingers count many times I've invited someone's home anything.

Superbowl. Ok, that's couple times. couple brothers Dad fans figured knew game did, right, remarkably good knowing penalty flag thrown.

American guests, people dance club would invite us BBQ I'm native English speaker.

My wife's former boss invited us birthday party.

You meet people similar interests club, invite home really rare. don‚Äôt understand people surprised number deaths. new virus, cure/vaccine yet. people able stay home feed families idiots don‚Äôt understand putting others jeopardy. feel stress anxiety building again. obvious. kid I‚Äôve wondered many people across geography history didn‚Äôt stand totalitarianism (whether communism fascism lens) taking lives; indeed history books showed even *cheered*.

Now living period, seeing opinions coming people (presumably) know read write, it‚Äôs amazing phenomenon behold IRL. wondering would use kind help called sub ""doomscrolling' like Trumpette willing rollover nothing combat pandemic.



Oh nooooo... Someone used stat based 0-54 years old cutoff instead 0-50 op arbitrarily used.


Walks like duck, quacks like duck... don‚Äôt get much hate trump? actually human though. I'll give Reuters benefit doubt here, making clickbait headlines. news outlets, sure. Complete insanity Interesting people complaining Facebook small group, it‚Äôs true none family members back Slovakia complained. went get tested, waited longer others nobody waited long. 

My sister Slovakia anxious accuracy test paid test 99% accurate. works people wanted sure negative.
Sadly, friend Slovakia whose ENTIRE family covid, every single person family - like 8 members, sick.

Thank you. already covid, live area badly affected March. think Matovic?? don‚Äôt know make him, don‚Äôt follow politics closely don‚Äôt really know stands politician. worn make time nervous? one saying wear mask pull far away people. Parents sending kids school think Europe bad, tried rural India white man? call congress pass stimulus - reopen theme parks right That‚Äôs child abuse Exactly, number cases still thanks. insane. Easy answer: Don't. sucks. Humanity imperfect. sucks less alternative though.

During first lockdown, town one block head shop, liquor store, food bank donation center thrift store. Guess one three declared ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù? right, food bank. People swivel-chairs suck making rules like fly. This. Maybe stay home? This. like using phone driving thing. cops too, who's gonna enforce it? love universally understood thing. speaking floridian, lower alabama, voted last week:

A) social distance. 

B) masks, sanitizer, face shields, dude... aerosol, lugee. 

C) yep. studies ~~may be~~ politically biased motivated

FTFY

Using Covid dashboard kids' school district maintaining, Covid 100% spreading schools, even pressure parents test kids known exposure.

If follow link Vox article, number cases schools doubled since published less 3 weeks ago. article reports \~52K cases, Covid Monitor reporting \~118K. gonna happen, thanks anyway! RE2020 publishing method, they‚Äôve also better prepared world future emerging diseases.‚Äù (trials start next year)
This great looks like help Covid-19. Yeah, despise weightless bodies jogging me. Though frictionless, I've got respect. Yeah. treat Earth like shit going pay multiple ways. Yeah. think regular tourism rebound safe (though also, whatever happens larger economy also massive influence), right lot sort low-level corporate political tourism overnight conferences fly-away meetings going largely end. groups may continue, writing wall time--I know groups allowed travel meeting since around 2008, example. 

I hope able find work hospitality field something adjacent. say Victoria ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs issue Rachel?‚Äù One reasons love EU easy migrate across borders resident. administrative matters related immigrating Germany show local city hall register, took two minutes (plus 30 mins waiting $20,000 year

Depends city personal consumption lot. I've able live study Heidelberg half price (without ever touching packof instant noodles), including flights home visit parents expenses. seriously read headline post/comment this? Yeah we're that. I'm couch right lol. hepa filter going, box fans blowing air apartment. hard actively separated without straight locking respective places. still share bathroom. know theres info situation either, feel like ton people globally living small places together. Sometimes share car pick someone want contaminate car. shows news sites know click bait you

I made presumption Apparently necessary realistic enforcement. shame. think implication cat bag. Pandoras box opened. 

The possibility new strain zero. Even covid know vulnerable society types diseases. Someone gets sick across global today could neighborhood tomorrow. 

We ending first year disease untill understand long terms can't cautious. Tbh, temperature Massachusetts right now, wearing mask isn‚Äôt issue. Working hospital I‚Äôm masked day every day, think it‚Äôs way masks trap warm breath face that‚Äôs uncomfortable. still move manipulate equipment and, frank, overweight unconscious people fine. Oxygen levels fine.

And I‚Äôm wearing N95 *and* procedural mask. That‚Äôs two masks. I‚Äôm sure people fully capable jogging flimsy paper/cloth mask. don‚Äôt want it‚Äôs ‚Äúuncomfortable.‚Äù

I disappoint. No, sure isn't, though one factor. Mosquitoes need factory farms infect us, pathogens spread plant life. keep thousands people employed closed almost year ""Kill squads."" That's really stupid. actually died? Get hit car drop dead heart attack? Congratulations, company completely screwed. Swampscott? Massive decreases took place spring many countries attributed either ""lockdowns"", ""partial immunity"" ""summer"". think that. suspect people really pay attention thats helps.

Nothing people paying attention distancing like 24/7 news coverage telling get sick, get hospital bed.  
As Belgiums numbers right soon tell whether lasting trend. headache causing transmission, headache possibly correlated replicating viruses spread breath. That's continued isolation indicated fever, science shown viruses breathed people still fever might capable replicating. No? thought so. That's ""masks work"" called surgeon general. probably took advantage position ""help"" Hawaii take vacation. Despicable person people PUA balance $16-20k. seem informed possibly lazy Well shit. completely depends current situation. want study? working field high demand Scotland? moved student worked well me, need savings. I'd expect least $20k year. Without Covid might able earn half working part time. Covid restrictions businesses offer popular student jobs, count getting work easily. Bruh. He's saying Belgiums icu Netherlands 2/1 Belgiums pop Netherlands 2/3. well import covid cases stay relevant science say indoor dining perfectly fine. 



People said ""fuck it"" went right back eating restaurants. Remember ""density"" (as people/square km) says absolutely nothing actual density people (as mean distance people likely interactions).

if did, people Australia Canada would risk infection they'd square kilometers themselves. That's works. Australia Canada rather dense sense everyone lives places lot empty. [Brazil lowest moving average deaths Covid since May 4th, 403 per day; death toll exceeds 160.2 Since Fed govt authorize even minimal help people work (like rest developed world does), businesses need reopen people eat place live.  would happen took multiple vaccines different manufacturers? Skynet playing us big push. avocado toast either :( 9 months covid restrictions outside 50 person meeting ban advisory measures 2 kids died (with health conditions) one half million chance? Come numbers scaring anyone 

Also, don‚Äôt get use excess deaths speculations stick data Well, alternative lockdowns life normal; lockdowns massive numbers cases deaths, lockdowns. So, keep eye go guess. Mcconell super determined blocking stimulus checks, good luck americans. Let guess, found antibody phage display? common technique used find mAbs affinity target protein.

What‚Äôs interesting isolated heavy chain fused Fc region, essentially making mAb without light chain.

Seems easy enough purify compared nanobodies, doubt it‚Äôs small enough enter bloodstream inhalation. real travesty talked all. first mention seen situation vets families going thru Really? so. passing prison reform legislation? Funding HBCUs? Compensating Spokane tribe, funding Native language programs, recognizing Little Shell Tribe? Making CBD hemp legal? Boosting income lowest 25% paid Americans 4.5%?

Really, gone far right?

Face it, trump JFK-esque democrat. Imagine walking dog park mask thinking stop covid lol Reading comment section makes blood boil. sub us supposedly ""all science"", yet frantically supports measure that's provably pointless, accidental passing people streets shown vector spread. insane argument ""I like wearing masks, find everyone"". isn't! thousands people completely devoid empathy concept people may feel differently? Fuck this, blocking sub reddit, need constantly reminded side human existence. No, clearly people didn‚Äôt read new order. exception you‚Äôre alone, personal vehicle members household. Let simplify little bit: worst political system politicians are, worse country going affected pandemic.

I know details Belgium comment, political system seems awful (I mean, Belgium big country, straightforward form government big underlying issue there) I‚Äôm fed people‚Äôs mentality towards pandemic western world. people asked wear masks, socially distance responsible protect others healthcare system. defiance people across Europe U.S taking toll mental health restrictions can‚Äôt even work moment! 

I‚Äôm sick hearing/reading people moaning can‚Äôt go pub go holiday. reaction pure stupidity general public truly shocked this. 

In October went back home country, England, funeral isolated except funeral. flew back live, English idiots plane taking holiday everything city live shut down. It‚Äôs stupid irresponsible. Ok dude. came Black Mirror mean boss around. Airqueen good calls rave party? comparing double ICU occupations. netherlands ICU / Belgiums ICU.

It conceivable point line vast majority people level immune response disease, resulting minor symptoms upon reinfection.

It's quite possible 4 coronaviruses currently cause colds almost people initially followed trajectory COVID-19 does. interesting case HCoV-OC43, endemic coronavirus usually causes cold, time time cause severe illness death elderly sick.

and nothing long schools stay open. understand decisions all. I'll blame government failing enact large testing programs really anything deal virus telling people stay indoors country comparing Netherlands to...? Netherlands high-ish population density. Oh first missed comma 4000.

It's semantics, lashing preceived ""gocha"" moment....when reality everyone responded simply said difference masks work masks thing worked. done calm non judgemental tones well. whatever reason gone rails lashed them.

Besides, advisories Baker put place past never led widespread fines even though area horrible regards advisories followed entire time.

China? mean ""went hard?""

China let virus run rampant months locked down. NZ they'd even South Korea, embodiment contact tracing

That'd Taiwan IMO. U.S. definition ""close contact"" creatively interpreted relies heavily person remembering they've spent sufficient time around actually cooperating contact tracers. count that.

Still, would prefer know countries limited resources managed Africa. also would want know effective contact tracing could (South Korea, embodiment contact tracing). Dammit, going order wings midnight wife went shopping first time since March last week. TJ Maxx, said shoppers weren‚Äôt going wrong way shopping isles (which I‚Äôve jaded to, since grocery shopping), but, weren‚Äôt even wearigg masks. 98% high? kind mask running in? run surgical mask even notice it. running thick cotton mask something could see Good lord, hope children sound like believe anything face value never follow it. 

1. know else cause similar inflammatory reaction similar MIS-C often higher rates? Almost viral infection child. MIS-C happens rates low barely worth discussing, again, already proven firm grasp statistics probability. 
2. know scientific consensus 'long haulers'? 'mystery', like fibromyalgia morgellons. may 0.00000001% (made example number obviously, idea frequency car accidents short trips)

It's accidents car trips short duration.

It took decades convince people wear seatbelts. remember government public safety campaigns. remember people saying would wear seat belt long trips somehow immune accidents close home.

It bother seatbelts became law shortly learned drive always wore them. remember people years older hostile idea mandatory seatbelts back people idea mandatory masks public.

So hostility masks, insane seems, really surprise me. It‚Äôs cool , enough ppl get vaccine societal armor strong enough create herd immunity you. Also expensive province wanna American southern state. Heads up, know didn‚Äôt suggest otherwise haven‚Äôt seen mentioned yet - least one study showed travels much cold air.

I‚Äôm guessing memory it‚Äôs least double triple suggested 6 feet. Lol, lying infections. numbers updated current information best latest definitions, that's normal US, lying one asians it. Fuck yellow skinned subhumans, right? quickly, lies came Korea, Japan, Vietnam fall under?

Good luck. Here's hoping suffer consequences ask for. Speaking autos, 1.3 Million people die per year globally according WHO, would allow cars travel 25 MPH? reasonable mask policies, mandating masks public indoors doesn‚Äôt make sense outdoors rural suburban communities people longer trust gyms get least part exercise outdoors. spend least two hours day outside either jogging walking. Terrible.

Our response praised kept calling weak.

No quarantine. contact tracing. enforcement masks.

Dr. Henry Adrian Dix thought knew better...

Some random guy internet knows better combined. that's good way think asymmetrical risk. chance needing seatbelt today low. chance someone needing seatbelt today high. masks. risk superspreader today low, chance enforced mask keeping viral lid superspreadser today high. everyone wear mask make sure today's potential superspreader wearing one too. country extremely low cases numbers (in state, zero last 4 days). still wear mask everywhere public, someone visits house part household, wear one. He's wanna American Conservative ""You show country thousand cases CFR less .05%.""

Iceland, Botswana, Singapore, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Maldives. China less 0.05%, 5.38% high first country officially hit. success beating virus due national efforts diligence Chinese people. Suck up.

""But PRC provinces managed miracle.""
Because build hospitals recruit thousands medics call, called national pride willingness save people expense economy less 3 months saw everything go back normal 7 months. Suck up.

""Oh God. went post history. Nothing couple years suddenly spreading PRC propaganda last year.""

I went work China see came back nothing praise country. people say anything good country weather (http://www.tour-beijing.com/real_time_weather_photo/wp-content/uploads/Yuyuantan-Park-Beijing-3.jpg , discount everything PRC propaganda. Got it. lockdowns what‚Äôs right 
Pick one Please provide scientific studies say masks work. refrigerator trucks get dead bodies. sad. It‚Äôs uncomfortable.

If I‚Äôm around people I‚Äôll always wear mask, I‚Äôm around ppl won‚Äôt.

Just like go work Im required wear nice cloths I‚Äôm time I‚Äôll wear whatever want.

Different situations lead different actions. 

Now, concede current political climate abnormal one party tends seriously downplay threat virus leading people equivalent wearing pajamas work. makes sense politicians take virus seriously forced overreact Charlie Baker mandate mask (ironically he‚Äôs republican).

So idk answer is, seems bit much exactly happen, kind doubt Trump fire Fauci Trump loses election. one thing Trump's Biden able overturn make look like loser. Trump knows that. I'm sure Trump kinds shenanigans last couple months office loses, though. supposed touching mask, leave house put take get home. handling take every time leave car, go store, get close someone sidewalk, etc. increasing risk handling (probably) contaminated mask. be. health experts come said incidental outdoor contact primary vector virus. prolonged, close exposure low air circulation.

Reading reddit you‚Äôd think run shitholes. places haterboner california it‚Äôs hysterical ""normal"" surgical mask, even ASTM 1, blocks 95% of.1 micron particles. sure consider normal.

Maybe referring uncertified masks? Quite useful wiping ass. said, since people charge enforcing generally political reasons, gonna change whole lot you. Rejoice.

My concern would *can* enforced me. I‚Äôm walking alone park cop decides doesn‚Äôt like looks me? Boom, $100 ticket. Yes, don‚Äôt expect enforced 99% time, rule, opens abuse. mean people take aspirin long term heart fare better too? see police officer wearing mask? kids gettin rona zoom large majorities population told ‚Äúno‚Äù first time life it‚Äôs devastating them.

Bunch children raising children. This:   Actually get 95% groceries delivered me, still work earn money pay them. still visit in-person buy town trash bags prescription refills baby. 

I know wearing mask doesn‚Äôt eliminate risk. cuts down, people masks, it‚Äôs far less likely domino chain people you‚Äôd spread to. 

The less viral load ‚Äúget‚Äù once, time body ramp it‚Äôs defenses fight off. That‚Äôs masks important. what's solution? Lockdown forever? lot pro school crowd left. Amen.

Because didn‚Äôt two immunizations consider annually - flu covid19. next inhalation-transmitted virus debuts 10 years world masks without objection smash it. Bad policy inept politicians. dumb touch come policies work people. middle woods literally mile away people still legally required wear mask. fucking joke. Unfortunately, jobs I‚Äôve life paid sick leave back staff didn‚Äôt show up. theses factors change, people forced go work want eat job. also considered mission critical expected work unless dead. don‚Äôt see factors changing anytime soon. yup, that's edicts - curfews prevent house parties, mask directive prevent transmission following existing mask orders.  That's pretty good idea. would lot less economic boon droves tourists visiting Japan, host country. yeah may need figure something like that.  taking us? mentally taxing, stressful, exhausting life ""making decisions"", either utterly completely spoiled coddled whole life, serious mental health issues, or.you learned manipulate people around *everything* - including thinking - poor helpless little whiner.   science would say walk past elderly lady outside dumpster get corona. left Europe months stay. . reasons increase imo. Winter forcing people inside / close proximity restaurants public transportation. It‚Äôs flu season- reason. Quarantine fatigue other, many people‚Äôs dedication safe practices waned months they‚Äôre getting sloppy. Shhhh I'm saying this, ran without mask would pissed. run across street think anything it.

Breathing heavily increase odds infecting someone go maskless inside store

Completely maskless rare (though Canada must freagin amazing see single instance since April). Non-compliance (mask nose, close enough can't tell they're definitely breathing outside mask) still very, common. expensive? get it? side street, sidewalk side street? Like room car pass you? yes soldiers medicinal parts this, clearly! they‚Äôre 19 year old recruits test random meds find solution they‚Äôre gonna send em out. you‚Äôre smart! /s Idk went Muse concert basketball arena last year sold Quebec's fighting second wave hard. Cases flat, going bit now. ASTM certified surgical masks stop 95-99% 100 nanometer virus particles, depending certification level. means hermetic, vastly better seem suppose. [Details time good read. see workers especially family want say anything contrary face. Argh! hate economic social pressures enable people without empathy. Well humans breathe, eat, speak scalps, MAYBE WOULD Wish work would take policy well. covid restrictions started happening, boss sent mass email telling everyone wear masks. 

Guess one wore mask work? (Hint: boss.) need around people public, wear fucking mask.

Easy hell. We're idiots world, despite Trump tried make us. Come people. Thanks! link info? want show someone. it‚Äôs 5 days, wouldn‚Äôt Cuomo make 5 days instead 4? Thanks again. hospital striking soon. mean it‚Äôs money Covid, still, week vacation great exactly issue. Everyone wearing masks indoors *and it‚Äôs enough*, surge underway. expanded outside well. Huh? Focus spikes actually coming instead issuing blanket edicts requiring masks everywhere nonsensical curfews fuck curb it. option? There's ton things sucks. Welcome society. 


People bad following flow charts using good judgement. tried, work. policy lot simpler removes room ambiguity.  


With said, since people charge enforcing generally political reasons, gonna change whole lot you. Rejoice. surprising. they're wealthy, likely want trump win grow clearly live fucking clue talking about. pandemic started towards end March autumn. first wave wrongly trusted people self isolate home, still borders open US, Europe else (only border closed China, people country hopping get around anyway).

We got mostly control across country winter (June). However virus escaped hotel quarantine started second wave Victoria. went hard lockdown based medical science data modeling get numbers down. Locking city easy knob. takes ton political fortitude people actually hard yards end result.

So people Victoria, sincere fuck you, achieved easy. Quite opposite. Yeah, prefer able use discretion enjoy feeling wind face one around. Also able eat, take sip water blow nose safely. I'm crowded sidewalk trail, obviously indoors, mask goes up.

But again, live small city Canada fairly steady numbers, hospital capacity need new deaths couple months. Plus, winter coming, suspect we'll see lot people keeping masks extra warmth. say shit Republican party Trump politicize fucking virus. Yes joggers without masks put others terrible risk since that‚Äôs they‚Äôre expelling many respiratory droplets. HATE people jog past massless. great! hand, last academic report saw current herd infection (which admittedly 2 months ago) said something like nation 10% population infected yet, even taking account worst case modelling invisible untested asymptomatic cases.

With numbers headlines flying around, people *feel* like 10% people gotten it. 2 months ago, case. 100% call Charlie Faker despite record. exodus led parents looking countries open safe schools members marginalized groups fed institutionalized racism, shaken visibility white supremacists worried Supreme Court swing right mean civil liberties. 

Do people actually buy this? Like pretty hilarious. shitty script work rich white people *fleeing* America whiter nations. 40-50% Americans refusing wear mask now, seeing large numbers people wearing mask vaccine available someone ignoring hardhat requirements I‚Äôd argue canned that‚Äôs start unsafe behavior.

I work mining construction hardhats still critical PPE. work aren‚Äôt required times. vehicles buildings take off. occasional mistakes (genuine) people follow rules quite well. 

If someone doesn‚Äôt want follow rules collectively get shit canned. It‚Äôs awful mess someone‚Äôs livelihood overall unsafe people put lives risk. Everybody needs stay lane. shit stupid. Ok guess that‚Äôs fair; smart watches weren‚Äôt thing serious running. set stopwatch home, hit got back. Logged times excel. 

But point, *care* enough keep track progress/times, likely know difference aerobic anaerobic exercise. risk distanced outdoors zero. reason use mask situations. people desperately want find ways saying lots people across country really sick Covid, waitresses Hooters finally stop wearing masks. Starting 1-2 months ago conspiracy theorists came new theory tests (that highly specific Covid RNA sequence). tests darn sensitive really annoying detect asymptomatic people quarantine can't go Hooters 14 days. Nevermind fact asymptomatic people special version virus, asymptomatic person give real, actual, deadly virus waitress Hooters others. Anyway, think less PCR cycles make test less sensitive.

But reality, Covid often using screening people well peak infectious window (for example, got exposed days sick yet), WANT detect small amounts virus, means really exposed fighting virus. Telling person stay home 14 days normal -- alternatives everyone locked letting virus rip hospitals overflowing sick dying -- better either? really understand conspiracy theorists. 

PCR test manufacturers make kind test calibrate them, tell detection limits, strange think know better test manufacturer.  uninformed thoughts:

For day day life think things normal. 

If visiting nursing home, could see needing tested and/or wearing mask thing years unless vaccine *extremely* effective. 

I imagine/would hope there's new interest in/investing preparing next pandemic may entail maybe different travel screening things. 

Depending effective vaccine widely distributed globally (which could take years), travel lot live/work international folks do, may taking extra precautions while. mask people getting smarter sectors? already produced billions year though. What‚Äôs one more? No, meant straight reusing disposable ones instead putting trash hours EU first full swing traveled west US can't help wonder history repeating sound pleasant. Wearing mask doesn‚Äôt take chances zero either. You‚Äôre comfortable going public instead getting everything delivered you? Wow, risky. Glad you‚Äôre neighbor.

Edit: argument current rules confusing inconsistent get proper behavior population. I‚Äôm 100% rule, saying honest rule smart instead making reasons aren‚Äôt true.  Remember sub saying Europe hit 'herd immunity' would lockdowns? LOL Nobody can, sure make personal attacks you. 70 cases full remote? Computer viruses?

Or perhaps elaborate. Oh shut up, let man celebrated well

Christ must nightmare person DeSantis fucking trash!  see rather forming coherent thought, going go copy pasting. lets address little emphasis context already provided previous comment. 

People can't trusted keep balls covered public, that's illegal wander around balls out. not, people could arrested waving balls children. That's illegal. need law people would behave themselves. people can't trusted behave, health safety others, people behave, arrest fine people wave balls around public.

A mask literally authoritarian making wear pants. Riding roller coaster upppp Technically, USA Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) $600/wk, like 20 weeks. Plus states, apparently I'm one, offer supplement addition that.

Problem is, I've work time, caring kids school home, owed 32 weeks unemployment moment. even hear great program initiated US $600/wk, millions people still seen dime that. yeah idk get people get mad thinks big trumpy dont want president make sure everyone world gets equal vaccine access 


i want make sure america's efforts go getting america vaccinated first. seems strange kind unpopular opinion saw study recently put 3ply surgical style masks 63% self protection. Regardless Japan something right like two-bit Depends you‚Äôre walking, urban/suburban areas you‚Äôd walk traffic get ten feet away. 

Even it‚Äôs almost zero, you‚Äôre cool that? Glad you‚Äôre neighbor. took 20 seconds Google. Found example. sure representative Fauci president 2024. Think that, he'd make exceptional president. Yeah seeing things see it, especially risk start vaccinated Don‚Äôt punish everyone people idiots. makes sense around Boston/Cambridge sure, entire state? saw people good distancing measures using common sense, people break rules probably continue so. approve dog‚Äôs handling covid pos-potus hard people see thoroughly incompetent organization?  Plenty people also seem act normal test getting results instead isolating symptoms! want change life acknowledge seriousness situation, simultaneously want everyone else suffer fall ill.

More importantly threw weight behind wrong side beginning dont want proven wrong. So, person covid positive wear mask comes contact multiple public resources/equipment ie hand rails, public seats etc one around thats OK? Go collect it, come back spread it.

""I take responsibility all"" -- Trump University School Epidemiology without Science

\*Mitch McConnell laughing pandemic\*    So, typical freedom mindset? Dude I'm scientist people come come close contact straight away fact virus last longer realise..

Imagine this, nice walk enjoy sun get hot need rest, sit public bench minutes. public seat safe? Maybe covid who's say person thinks actually covid sat bench hours you?

Do understand I'm trying say?

I'm trying hang shit mate. understand people understanding logic. freedom? caring others? actually thinking? maybe I'm brain washed? Well, strangely enough, Boston really bad, enacted changes really dealt quickly, steadily (and gradually) getting worse last months. There's lot said clear, easy-to-follow guidelines, really *any* strategy encourages people keep heads asses like, ten minutes, consider choices affect people. Ridiculous tell heard one source. Looking hands wearing rubber gloves, might one dangers.
Perforation problem, too, especially using disinfectant, even without rubber gloved tend holes. realize videos internet Thailand entire pandemic contradict saying? 

There's also going find fuck tons people wearing masks throughout protests, videos every day life throughout markets around Bankok. Also - masks working well they're sparying hundreds protests [every hours end.

There people vlogging every country world last 8 months. claims verified within seconds.

How feel lower class getting absolutely destroyed lockdowns Thailand - particularly decimation tourist hospitality industry like 15% Thailand's GDP policies suck shit tons people severe poverty they'll likely never recover from? okay go 5am 10 pm virus spread times. late night bars. I'm convinced. Flu season winter. sudden cases rising.

Just like cases bad cold environment slaughterhouses. virus lives longer every surface outside, maybe hangs longer cold air around places people pass through. u move forward   So, Im MA, watched speech today. point mandate give authority people arguments. 'Look mandate wear mask'. remove ambiguity situations 'so I'll stay 6ft away I'm putting mask on'. let's people put blame governor take heat argument, there's fines anything, literally help people able enforce mask rules. Slovak, might add additional info.

The whole project started week ago 4 counties hit virus most. Roughly 140k people came (91% people come - people 10-65 years-old). 5 600 positives, 4% tested. get tested go work.

This week whole population. 3.8m eligible Slovaks, 3.6m came, 38359/1.06% tested positive. 99.2% testing sites open. Success. get tested self-quarantine 10 days (they can't go work outside walk, essentials like buy food).

What's interesting compare many people tested positive week ago 4 first counties. Roughly 50% reduction positives, PCR positives week also dropped!

Some counties tested positive low 0.33% (our capital city example).

Tests used - antigen (not antibody) rapid tests. came, got tested, waited 15 minutes got result. Everybody social distanced wore masks, safer going supermarket. Almost conflicts, everything went peacefully.

The goal reduce number cases, completely eliminate virus, even caught 50% active tests (according studies), still massive success. We'll see numbers change next weeks. hit counties tested next weekend.

It cost roughly 100m euros. One day total lockdown would cost country 100m euros anyway project happened, would gone 2-3 weeks long lockdown (said PM epidemiologists). would say much much better.

Any questions? Wearing mask you‚Äôre nowhere near people doesn‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs security theater point. masks work you‚Äôre near others, that‚Äôs entire purpose serve. negative test needed board plane turned back. negative test prior departure mean virus incubating infection can't happen transit. Most? All, far I've ever read. I'm pretty sure pretty advanced masks are, fact, designed prevent diseases - medical n95s big ol respirators whatever - would actually able avoid disclaimer. going convince Florida idiots summer Wisconsin. Weather absolutely 100% fact Florida huge outbreak andWisconsin summer. You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm blind misread. Thanks pointing Instead conceding, Trump may sneak White House underground tunnel show Russia. .. muh ethics remember favourable me.... [... Yet still evidence people gain immunity, even mild cases reinfection? likely yes. incredibly frequent? Based current evidence, probably not. learn think take responsability actions need government put blanket laws everyone make ready say right? Cops need start getting arrested aiding abetting allowing crimes. called fascism took That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important, that‚Äôs must done. Belgium kiss once. Always weird going France sharing 3 kisses Patriot Act. shit someone follows guidelines, wears mask around others businesses, what‚Äôs harm removing outside, great distance away people? can‚Äôt support anything gives police government even power harass people something completely harmless. ways? simply can‚Äôt bothered stand six feet people? Could elaborate global pandemic suddenly disappears election night single country? bad mention mask must worn correctly! chin warmer. hell look 2nd wave hospitals got close breaking point, started slow got serverly bad neared capacity managed eek out. exactly zero placebo-controlled studies showing masks stop virus. People post computer models, anecdotes, opinions masquerading fact on. real evidence sort showing antibiotics work strep throat (as example) non-existent. fair, lot less expensive tell people wear mask woods close businesses across state. 
 
I agree you, feel like rational rollback plan place here, think ""both, good"" kind fair place comes ""should B proven beneficial protective measure?"" 
 
Fact is, least city, shit ton people bothering wear masks all. think Baker's point ""fine, always wear it"" actually kinda reasonable reaction frustration dopes never cared masks first place. Thank internet stranger! Sending hugs :) right. Killing fuckton people far realistic option.  Still EU worry looters, wildfire, healthcare. Worth me. Also still earn enough comfortable life. ? Actually, kind interesting point let tell you. Judging comments posts Facebook, guessed lot people comply, complete opposite turned truth. Nobody complained, everything orderly, minor incidents happened. seems people commenting Facebook small vocal group people hate everything, people completely ok coming, even wait. think big opposition Slovak people. 

And regarding comment US, sad that's true. Hope alright! get US? French scientists estimated real figure 100k new cases per day last week. likely continue week lockdown measures take effect.

Also positivity rate risen pretty much daily since last week 100k likely quite conservative. said helped. Ok. Thank all. 15-20% immune. sure big amount ill people is. around two weeks ago restaurants bars closed could see 4 people.

It also wake call people take serious again.

So think stricter measures, herd immunity.  get you‚Äôre saying, joking idea partisan issue enables others continue making one. Fun fact: pay hefty fee revoke citizenship. Something like 2-3k  Got beers civic duty see. isn‚Äôt partisan issue dunce. Pull order read it. ""health condition"" exemption still there. say cop, they're allowed ask anything further. cops know none enforced can't be.  average person stays 6 days. amount hospitalizations reducing. tough wont complete collapse. Now, someone made decision me. That's one less thing decide.

This treating symptom disease. kind mental issue (I'm trying say kindest way possible). Please seek therapy didn‚Äôt go back normal people wearing masks completely alone. Nobody‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing part‚Äù wearing mask point. fell like mask right way appropriate situations would work better chin diaper anytime. take two weeks infectious. Paris

Didnt change thing angry get shiny glove? released plague us? single country many cases deaths per capita United States either. Whataboutism wonton response backing. towel Staying home sick. FINALLY. Nothing annoys colleauge sick AF comes work show hero next week sick bed. good change. I'm working polls hours. already knew us, workers, protect ourselves. Good know could done something didn't. help Fyi thats false. reported missinformation. Wear mask, social distance wash hands.  worry, I'm pharmacist knew stuff beforehand. invasive nasal swab pound eye back. Still nothing. Facts numbers show kids bringing virus home spreading family spread others.  Seriously fucking stop.  ok.  acceptable.  fucking murder. got hit hardest viral load Nordic countries.

What source Swedes go skiing Alps every winter, Danes don‚Äôt ski much 

There Danes going skiing Alps Swedes per capita. blonde american exception you? lots politicians believe science.

Just enough dumb-fuck america. Zaghari Ratcliffe Iranian

She nothing whatsoever UK

She went Iran Iranian passport, past seems involved rather dodgy dealings agitations country
Now mess claims dual nationality UK hopes UK going get mess Iran British Passport.
Her UK family claiming February covid19 ""excuse"" pressure UK gov get out. Covid became worldwide pandemic excuse hurriedly dropped presumably recovered likely never it.

Iran like many places recognise dual nationality.

She (UK)'s problem.

End Story every human life value friends loved ones care them.  deaths preventable people like standing way suggest step way blame happens next. Go say people lost friends loved ones pandemic.  fucking dare you. See happens.  shit going stop one way another determine happens next. Yeah infected normal flu 99.8% survival rate ""...but that's opinion."" Yep, sure is. Fuck Fauci Man got unlucky this. renewed lease full price January 31. this, thought would getting low rents winter renewal date welp. coma since March ....lol?  suggest learn empathy.  said grieving mourning done people going start demanding answers allowed happen. too. Like Far East. don‚Äôt want live world people sacrificed. least try, morally it‚Äôs right thing do. reopening setting kids make dumb choices. Sweden various countries lock down. sub echo chamber argue.  people die them? statistics matter? Honest god something got done sociopaths massive threat rest society. wearing goddamn mask.

No, that's conclusion report example, counties 70‚Äì80% population always used masks (considering category: ALWAYS) also corresponded higher COVID-19 cases, part community never used face cover (considering category: NEVER) counties low infected cases. Thus, mask use tricky confounder used considerable caution developing future analysis.

Here's actual potential factors trips spending time away home top two contributing factors COVID-19 growth, relative importance 34% 26% respectively. next two important factors population urban density, relative importance 23% 13% respectively.   Pump dump. Junk move on. really job it? Owning shoes make job know cops legally text drive, too? exempt law, even though dangerous DWI. sure abt countries know NZ closed borders right anyway dude literally black white - little common vermin inhabit middle country. 

they made fundamentalist bed - let sleep it. WTF NY California still contributing anything farce? We'd rather didn't. people‚Äôs behavior weather changes different though. colder areas country, way small gatherings know happening due fatigue. events what‚Äôs driving increase. warmer areas, still spreads people able operate outdoors, it‚Äôs said humidity inhibits spread virus. vast majority people died far infected Denmark Norway announced lockdowns

This completely false! DK announced ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù March 11th 12th. full month later less 1.300 people died. less 25% total far it‚Äôs likely take long die considering 80+ years old.  


How extremely wrong? must remember Sweden got hit hardest viral load Nordic countries.

So far one able supply data back claim. doesn't. social media pushes bunch horseshit masks giving lung infections literally worse getting Covid people milk shit conspiracy filled home pages. needs serious reform false information deal online. Cool mate. I'm wearing mask myself, young fit wear others people risk. could house mate person even know. Surface transmissions maybe lower end possible transmission know certain willing risk others health. assume live different worlds comes trusting people power got much say that. wish best. Lockdown Light Plus Pro 256 GBs Northeast suffering beginning, got laughed ‚Äòreal Americans‚Äô, it‚Äôs transparent know guys feel us. 
 
Well, guys warned. chose treat like joke. hahaha. maybe Senate.

the rest lot fucked capital F...... blame dear leader instead know this, Trump office longer protect sociopaths American people turn attention ilk 100% complicit murder 300k people.  consequences justice.  NONE happening US right acceptable level.  capable better.  capable effectively containing virus Trump death cultists get board death suffering China bullshit dear leader telling you. Walter Reed? Journal Public Health research points probability public protests spike covid-19 struggle extrapolate major issue, 99% people exposed covid-19 fine would draconian limit people's freedom speech (or many freedoms). pre-existing conditions elderly protected. going riots either way.

and Trump could well win. study 60 super-spreading events shows events one person infects six people much common **would expected range transmission rates followed statistical distributions commonly used epidemiology.**

Bold me.

It's like past experience draw from. Yes, come surprise me, science sometimes needs data time proof ""we know"". that.  USA like containing COVID-19 virus early could kept control? Health agencies US Europe known dangerous COVID-19 is. Even China stalled weeks taking action, found dangerous contagious managed contain instead letting spread 'flattening curve'. Look [death see good Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea many others done. I‚Äôd love tomorrow going. majority developed world racist fuck. laugh Americans think America racist. It‚Äôs like ever fucking Europe? disgustingly racist. Like 1950s there. Explain person's ignorance causes starvation..... Turns lawsuits expensive.  Trump's presidency family spent year spain made wife get german citizenship grandmother fled holocaust. I've spent much last two years learning Spanish, wife fluent. things improve, plan move Spain. weary war endless stupidity - fled country 2004.

ask anything. Americans don‚Äôt worry healthcare, wildfires looters either. What‚Äôs point? could always take precautions like wearing mask much possible, leaving windows open much can, washing hands lot, one person sleep couch living room couple weeks, etc. thoughts. issue kids spread virus families friends.  Honest god almost year point.  None remotely difficult grasp. making things up?

Border Mexico closed. 

The land border Canada closed Americans Canadians freely fly two subject quarantine rules. also many, many countries without closed borders, including Americas, places like New Zealand Hong Kong South Korea (again, subject quarantine. NZ it‚Äôs super strict). 

The rest try paint sort anti-American bullshit reality majority world strict immigration laws apply everybody regardless passport. U.S. probably easiest first world country world immigrate Americans probably get idea reverse also simple.   physical distancing one thing problem. refraining socialization quite another Lol people keep pointing that. Zero zero, neither thing exists. Covid19 significantly contagious flu.  Seriously give fucking rest already. ha. coloradans go next week?

shuffling deck chairs Titanic.... one, said spread ver much, still infected adults.

Has contact tracing done here? know kids infected kids adults? Home shit spreading unfortunately. Prove shut fuck up.  fucking care uncivil.  fucking fed bullshit.  300k people fucking dead many come people still fighting tooth nail know better actual experts scientists. sure one else works exposure? Maybe issues isn‚Äôt necessarily related incident? seem like overkill otherwise. think ""forcing"" kid wear mask better option killing people. Maybe I'm weird like that.

Jokes aside, I'm furious people actually think like that. Put damn mask kids psychos. forget /s ? credibility. Actually *bad* luck cases escaped quarantine started second wave got hand quickly. Joe Biden's problem instead Trump's, media give inch ink except Fox.  Regardless party follow, result covid-19, media, misinformation. combination three really. difficult find unbiased accurate trustworthy information right now. political party 28% oppinion polls says follow swedish model instead locking shutting down. 


Imagine Belgium take swedish measures bend like true Belgians. almost ignorance like US 25% covid19 cases despite 4% world's population. 

How harmed wearing mask outside? Seriously issue here?  9 months stupid bullshit NONE yet offer sort explanation justification.  want wear masks social distance? Stay fuck home like happens next.  Continual noncompliance going force country lockdown every single last one blame it. understand me. 
A lot people find lockdown measure draconian refer follow Swedish approach lock down. 


Imagine belgian numbers lock down. chances belt?  everyone subreddit support it! disappointed shocked society.

The coronavirus largely cause deaths severe illness young fit healthy people. prevented enjoying prime years lives bunch old folk govt denying freedoms. people impacted idea mentally strenous incapacitating lockdown us. young adult effect mental health. gym shut, ability socialise gone, nothing look forward to, can‚Äôt visit loved elderly want see could die day saying would rather spend time risk it, 

I spoke kids husband forcing mother stay bedroom isolate, terrifed cannot speak english vulnerable. getting food door nothing else. 

This way live, elderly vulnerable want isolate rest us want take chances allowed to.

I think already got virus symptoms mild even non present lot people needed treatment. 

This one scenario agree Nigel Farage - saying something! people fought lockdowns mostly small business working class barely protected this. china communist. OK woudl do? Founded greed. 

""hey CAN'T tell freedom!!!"" Streak broken üíî horrible. 
I feel like slipping cracks heard mention now. poor kids... hope don‚Äôt long term effects do.. someone held accountable this. mean, you‚Äôre essentially forcing kids get potential lifelong illness. Yeah shocked read requirement. School openings problem one wants see. worry, virus still six months. people seriously need perm banned here.   Kids able spread covid19 exactly like adults data back others denying. suspending completely? Indeed, lots people get em implied.  Possibly?

I would probably compare stats ""all people hospital"" rather people ICU get better comparison.

But know stat. Almost feel sad respected expert whose career forever carry stench Trump chose please instead protect Americans.

And like even honey pot get it. own. quit last week thought - walked out. thread full people reaffirming other's ridiculous belief. Explain like it! using on. country ""blocked"" Sweden Europe? far know, Switzerland mid-july Germany point? Thats nice hear Birx change, but, needle record player gonna bust.... doublespeak. People rely small businesses destroyed. Peoples futures dependent education. Poor people need make money now. thoughts exactly - handing anti-maskers *legitimate* objection government overreach.

I problem wearing mask around people - Hell, kind wish *keep* that, never mind Covid, helps prevent spread plenty things (this year's flu season likely complete dud result - never mind mortality rate, flu plain sucks). absolutely zero science behind wearing mask block Covid alone. safety anymore, *obedience*.

Congrats, Charlie - lost ""science"" best argument. Stop worrying people's breathing focus 25,815 cases tested today South Korea. 

And close identifying cases. fact, whole media go crazy untraceable cases. 

Thanks. broken record. 

Also mean take smoking. Everyone know caught entire family catch it. mean shit hangs air couple hours. outside supposed mean better ventilation, air stale fuck there's potential still around ya.

Not say ""be paranoid!!"" think wear mask outside unless hella windy. Also cause neighbors masks outside two weeks pandemic, lot people complex. reason ‚ÄúICU increasing‚Äù definitions differences cases. Broken record. Yeah OK,its cold, fall ,cases exploded again.FFS. means many people coming borders weekly. Maybe even ‚Äúthe whole population NZ‚Äù weekly. 

Trust me, would need military streets ‚Äî would naturally cases dense cities, would many people flaunting orders Sorry, incorrect. Covid linger anywhere. two cases wider social circle, failed around mid September northern Baden.

I hardcore pro privacy, somehow feels place right now.
People allow tracking companies profile 24/7. purpose vague privacy policies, likely allow rejecting job applications insurance requests based usage patterns Office apps, smartphones social media jurisdictions.

A days quarantine full financial compensation seems quite harmless comparison.

The company question explicitly reasonably believe prevent someone dying suffering serious physical harm, may provide information government agency

Of course, legal applicability always weighted skewed zeitgeist. brainwashed really. Unless course live hermit hills grow/hunt food dont give rip humanity. guy's going get rich Philip Morris hires pro-smoking ads. point? I'm wife's side here. Fake news   2020 GoT season 8. BS? like punchline. countries surprisingly ""did right thing"" hard lockdowns early on, blunted initial surges. Then, neoliberalism kicked in, powers got worried economy, opened back up. simple fact can't ""free market"" way pandemic. 

What done reduction cases. Stay closed forever? Lmao talking Tories. invented politicians giving shit average people. Scott pave way fucks given Governor it?

Honestly, Desantis first corrupt Governor state, last.

It'd nice could get one abused position small ways - using state property vacation, say - shit last two worth blaming him. People believe right wear mask. coming year covid 8 months us learned nothing. blame people Precisely people ICU.

If need respirator, go ""ICU light"" (intermediary care, intermedi√§rv√•rdsplats).

Its advanced care less staff needed.

So actual number compare compare countries might ICU + people intermediary care + maybe people geriatric care. know, masks permanent now. ‚Äúcurve‚Äù talk. it. increasing weeks now, e.g. 56 2020-10-26 77 today. I'd rather save people businesses. Congress doesnt decide that, state right decide replace elected officials. ""the governor appoints new one"" that's is. It‚Äôs enforceable you‚Äôre cops aren‚Äôt also dumb enough believe masks unwilling prosecute enforce policy onto white folks.


My county mask mandates went criminal offense civil bc higher level white offenders. suck hard regret would match vitals ER ;) We‚Äôre finding tonight we‚Äôre going neighbors...  regular Sherlock Holmes! ha, ha. heard Bill Gates involved one. Fleeing where, exactly?

Canada? Makes Trump look like No-Borders anarchist. Good luck getting without PhD speaking French

Europe? Presuming mean ""The UK, Germany France"" parts Europe either poor culturally make US look left-wing. Europe general becoming increasingly right perception European exceptionalism reddit needs fucking stop.

Tiawan Asian nations? speak language? socially conservativ3? not, fun.

I'm guessing good portion world priority though. I'm guessing rich white people going consider places like Africa, India, Indonesia forth despite holier-than-thou propagating orange evil intolerant, stand nation rich culturally similar place origin. far worse that:

## Abstract

Background: Close contact children may provide cross-reactive immunity SARs-CoV-2 due frequent prior coryzal infections seasonal coronaviruses. Alternatively, close contact children may increase risk SARs-CoV-2 infection. investigated whether risk infection SARs-CoV-2 severe outcomes differed adults living without children. Methods: Working behalf NHS England, conducted population-based cohort study using primary care data pseudonymously-linked hospital intensive care admissions, death records, patients registered general practices representing 40% England. Using multivariable Cox regression, calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) outcomes 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living without children household. Findings: Among 9,157,814 adults ‚â§65 years, living children 0-11 years associated increased risks recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital ICU admission associated reduced risk COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living children aged 12-18 years associated small increased risk recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), associated COVID-19 outcomes. Living children age also associated lower risk dying non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults years association living children outcomes related SARS-CoV-2. observed consistent changes risk following school closure. Interpretation: adults living children evidence increased risk severe COVID-19 outcomes. findings implications determining benefit-harm balance children attending school COVID-19 pandemic. Funding work supported Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1. Thats lot deaths case count. wonder positivity rate is. doublespeak. Sure, still extremely rare. story like would pretty scary back March. November, ""dozens"" reports reinfections. Confirmed cases single digits.

Out 34,000,000+ recovered. Well sounds mighty generous I‚Äôm fully stocked thank Taiwan might allowed skip class. Americans reason americans can't nice things. We're always three weeks away near total reversal COVID cases organization actually prepare shut three weeks meaningful way.

But leaders fragile. citizens fragile. infrastructure fragile. science literacy pathetic. ability use reason logic nearly non-existent.

So get theater like guide dumb people closer right action spite themselves.

Obviously dumb, Americans dumb, policies take account. Wind travels far believe Beaches outside, correct?

We saying spreads outside effectively too? unimportant events? 5 November. I'm guessing Trump's list people fire election along Faucci. think mean 5 November. super power killing people breathing them.

 Oh wait.. that's everybody else. surely will, know will. Long overdue. still habits changed. WW2 things go back were, world different. continue work remotely, continue cook more, wear mask public go sick name few. Yes, saying difference relevant. went like 20 70 people ICU two months. hope growth stays low. Paid actors.  /s  realized use talking situation subreddit. reason lack semblance appropriate response terrible outcomes people would outraged happened country brushed away happens Sweden. People blinders on. enforce mother going jail. articles read like liberal arts undergrad research paper write certain number words paper start 3 hours du.

None articles address heart question. 

Can anybody show wearing masks protect VIRUS ISOLATED? endure vaccine.

Save lives profits. means things changed. Even virus disappeared today people, technology, etc changed. liberal I‚Äôd rather police handle actual criminals rather someone who‚Äôs refusing wear mask. don‚Äôt know case. assume droplets linger air (which studies show haven‚Äôt), you‚Äôre unmasking exit store, point literally every single person passing leaving droplets also unmask take sweet big gulp air. Sometimes I‚Äôm really struggling I‚Äôll unmask halfway across parking lot , try n wait til get car. Yes, 7 days sufficient, see research data wife bring masks walks put we‚Äôre going walk people. time year glasses get fogged soon put mask on. It‚Äôs either wear mask blind don‚Äôt wear mask need to. Non sequitur. I‚Äôm Boston north like ten min city I‚Äôve literally seen one masked cop since mask became thing. one single mask. Shameful. Nothing that. Lockdown still choice, one yet proven work long term. sure wouldn‚Äôt make even lower. Like 4 something. 8 still pretty high considering infection rate  I'm sorry loss. say that. big tech making ton money increased usage, Netflix, Amazon, ecommerce competition destroyed, RECORD stock increases, Target Walmart making money small businesses shut down, pretty much compnies benefit small businesses suffering, hospital execs making killing govt money, politicians using fear get reelected, health officials getting unprecedented amounts power. Big pharma even need explanation. 

Why think big companies commercial apps market social distancing like crazy. Corporation things money. stupid. people are. pushing something like this, probably wrong side history. guess that‚Äôs El Paso setting fourth mobile morgue unit. begin reuse it, study linked comes 700 day days. That's exactly problem. care. Extrapolate people country, regardless political views overwhelming number people care ""tired"" caring, shit storm see today. I'm looking covid cases right now, looks like Midwest getting fucked. Texas, Dakota's, Wisconsin, name few, overflowing. California quite yet, expect change soon everyone wants fun. Even vaccine become available, sizeable anti-vaxxer demographic country. anti-intellectualism US sadly hilarious. things going back normal.any time soon.

The US cases first world country.

Economy? That's beside point. Yes, people need make living. tell average American got one stimulus check $1200, even cover rent/mortgage, yet big corporations got bigger slice pie? That's yet another way government fucked Americans. money corporations got could've meant monthly checks all

But yes, everywhere look US, everything marred egotism, selfishness, mismanagement. Biden fix anything. Trump make worse. Everyone get sick. Many die. rich taking money bank.

The Democrats slightly worse Republicans, we're relegated choose two shitty parties otherwise we're ""trowing away"" vote.

Great fucking country amirote? Covid-wise, we're lumped India Brazil. Tell great America again? that‚Äôs fair, leaves question enforces health guidelines? TLDR: infections colds flus seem offer protection Covid, several vaccines might. Well least got good laugh skimming bullshit comments caused Jews bottom. It‚Äôs okay guys. I‚Äôve heard people it‚Äôll Easter, spring, summer, etc it‚Äôll vanish November 4th. 1 day it‚Äôll fine. Netherlands around 1600 IC beds total.

That's already including emergency expansion IC capacity, remember earlier year said 1000 IC beds.  old ones dying... bet votes like rest us: take trash.

March: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs attentive scientific literature details data,‚Äù Birx said. ‚ÄúI think ability analyze integrate data comes long history business really real benefit discussions medical issues.‚Äù

Never forget. That‚Äôs true. Protests don‚Äôt cause spikes science really wants case. Yeah way I'm that. I'm wearing mask completely isolated walk dog 6am rofl. That's going far.  mom teacher really worried students (1st graders) dealing masks. said they've done great job always wearing them, social distancing too.

Then parent teachers conferences day said half parents wearing masks came school, saw mom wearing hers. They're damn careful school get school year without problems, dumb fuck parents going ruin wearing masks public, ballgames, etc. Production going kind ham, supposed billions doses worldwide January apparently that's one condition. they're generally healthy otherwise, fine. Average age death 70's 3 conditions.

What's worse: catching stage 1 cancer early stage 4? Everything Trump Touches Dies.... they're still alive? criticslly thinking arrive conclusion it, maybe world ending like say is?

History shown us people don‚Äôt give fuck, they‚Äôre going want regardless tell do. war drugs classic example. Wait, now? Take complaints covid. def hard, mean could vote actually good candidate healthcare environmental policies would work near immediately, could vote guy basically said would fire wins often though. hospitals private technically anything. Even grocery store shop lot people wearing masks. 30,000,000 Americans live poverty.

Unfortunately hospitalizations Germany trending absolutely wrong way. may able support neighboring countries sooner later. Interesting. states bordering states would take want one country. Alright, thanks lot! Ha, actually read Charlie Brooker headline really confused creator Black Mirror making people US wear masks lol. screen shot March 17th, back covid Ebola MERS. Crazy see far come.  Yeah unfortunate one around cares :( ""black conspiracy theorists"". tons different types people bought idea masks dont work, airtight evidence convenient them. Tons people ""counter culture"" think conspiracy going on, like argue breathing extra CO2 wearing mask, arent effective. people dont trust authority, whether doctor anyone else. non-emergency. Even operations needed (but urgent) postponed moved hospitals. Old people would get point extremely depressed they‚Äôre surrounded people masks treating like plague.


There give take.  Germany taking patients Netherlands probably Belgium well. mean, wearing mask brings ""close zero"" ""actual"" zero entire point mandate. thousands people something odds ""close zero"" still like odds. RIP local hospital ICU Yes. Many problems. Swedes taking seriously. diligence poor. Second. FHM giving poverty advice. dare ask something costs money. They're telling public transit increase departures. They're telling govt start producing masks. give cheap advice individuals. go give shit.

Quote

Birx, speaking White House press briefing, singled a¬†recent study United Kingdom originally predicted 500,000 people would die virus since revised predict 20,000 deaths U.K. said data government collected show 20 percent U.S. population would infected COVID-19, cautioning predictions say so.
""When people start talking 20 percent population getting infected, scary data matches based experience,"" Birx said. One problems people assume they're going able socially distance but, especially Boston, going happen. Everyone thinks they're *exception* rule, circumstances different. 

That said, I'd say least half cops I've seen wear masks, even go inside places (like Dunkin' Donuts). it‚Äôs smokers it‚Äôs anybody wearing mask. stupid article. It‚Äôs stupid equivalencies like make mask adoption hard. curves look good. Here's latest case/death charts spikes cases deaths.

Nebraska still better terms total numbers. They're 35.02 deaths per 100k. ranks 41st per capita rank 15th 7-day deaths (hot Yeah, guess could question countries I've instead clear cultural disagreements governmental authority. Common theme MA: take one step outside store, remove mask take deep breath.

Mine comes walk stores look around see pass anyone closely I'll continue so. area people around, keep pass them. laugh people driving, alone, wearing mask, silly. OAN....... poor countries dont even need vaccinated. death rate countries low, worth it. 

The virus cannot spread well warm weather people wayy younger poorer countries. Purely anecdotal: got positive covid test away work. wife isolate hotel room. She, thankfully, never got it. counted us lucky, reading article doubly thankful outcome. exact number really matter context discussion. cancelling surgeries talk covid lot. They're cancelling surgeries there's lot people needing hospitalised. 

What matter 20% 1000 cases, 2% 10.000 cases 0.2% 100.000 cases? hospital gonna empty figure out? voted today small town pa polling place. 100% mask compliance 20 voters present without noses showing. 

Out 4 workers: waiting polls officially open 4 walking around without masks. 

6:59am (I voter #10)- 3 workers put masks sh!t 3 noses showing oldest unhealthiest one stayed without mask.  

Mercia... that's true, really board. types obsessed job numbers? Crisis actors scale LOT new jobs... take account sacrifice done people want deal 3 weeks total lock strict protocols like contact tracing madks.

What's worse second wave, even lockdown could avoided completely. everyone kept 1.5m distance times wore mask whenever they're home, every shop, cinema, gym, etcetera forced close could remained open. abject stupidity people refuse follow *few simple* rules, even protest *really fucking simple* rules, staggering infuriating.  waves new metagame trend Don‚Äôt swear buddy, already caught it, ever spreading anybody anyways; I‚Äôm exempt. good news, Belgium's daily infection rate dropped, 474,000 US Equivalent cases 11/1, 330,000 US equivalent yesterday, 177,436 US equivalent today--Hopefully continue Im sick hearing people complain family Nanotechnology vaccines..... conspiracy theorists right? would invest money something shut indefinitely? Lol US equivalent new SI unit? malls even around anymore? ones city ghost towns. I'm looking forward fair non-biased enforecement rules sub. *scoffs* believe central side quest Skyrim well. Yeah guarantee see anyone apologize calling us crazy. Sttttooooooopppp. ruining narrative :( work food service industry, managing QSR (or ""fast food"" restaurant). 

Restaurants ""go"", unless failed adapt, concept allow adapt new situation. 

Unsurprisingly, fast food sales sharply since pandemic began, solely core model industry allows drive-thru to-go options easily modified adapted made COVID safe. Restaurants took initiative early adopted options provide food customers across many platforms still surviving many cases thriving. provide to-go drive through, delivery via DoorDash/UberEats/etc, online ordering options alternatives traditional methods in-house service.

Those adapted survive, unwilling unable adapt close. restaurant game already fickle crap shoot COVID. carry mask put necessary. northeast also better Canadian neighbors north. Canadians want keep border closed New Yorker, I‚Äôm glad. Ontario Quebec higher positivity lot less testing do. I'm wondering many people completely asymptomatic 1st infection, never got tested infected again, officially 2nd infection 1st infection one they've tested for. wouldn‚Äôt change anything. could put yard still wouldn‚Äôt care. Good post, need edit title. mods delete, repost real headline title. [CovidActNow's Nov 2nd Map: Currently, states US track contain covid wear mask day, every day, millions workers. non problem correctly sanitized masks. 

Instead Olympic medal mental gymnastics find half ass excuses, wear fucking mask.

Edit: I'm mad comment I'm ranting. answered question fairly. vote allowing fools send patients responsible state. think western government would fail like this? studies assumed measures Nah, worse flu. set mobile morgues November *every* year. /s love read article... Typical, read headline share link.

TL;DR

The article states EVERYONE dying tested see COVID, bodies backup TEST (94 queue article written)

Now let's talk real-world numbers. US ""expected Mortality"" 0.75% simple math let's say 750 people per 100k annually.

El Paso population shy 700k estimate 5250 people die year city alone. That's 14 people day, 100 people week, 431 people month.

These numbers also assume smaller communities hospital would transport patients El Paso. So, regular no-Corona day El Paso, mean tell El Paso manage 326 people died El Paso last month?

The morgue excess death dipshit, death classification. waiting test results find people Covid died.

The Article continues go stating people El Paso divided worried C19 community want things open like normal, disgruntled still restrictions place reaction virus joke put center stage. even goes state Police agree joke enforcing shutdowns Texas Attorney General‚Äôs Office, currently suing county judge stop shutdown. I'm implying that. yes 30,000,000 masks available past 6 months. need 1 washable mask. 30mil people poverty need new masks daily go public daily.

Stop doomsday crap. obtained reusable mask past 8 months, that's literally you. available. I've given away dozens happily give away need. several ready go one needed them. theres legal process make thing law, swinging dick cant ‚Äúorder‚Äù ‚Äúdeclare‚Äù ever want.... ffs anyone seen school house rock??? 


I'm bill.
Yes, I'm bill.
And I'm sitting Capitol Hill. yeah, September oftentimes got result back night, 2-3 days. point often even infectious anymore. really toned testing back save resources later. Oftentimes positives among hundreds tests. Also parents refusing tests now, able earn money try taking care kid forced long 14 day quarantine. Umm soon pandemic ends new ownership moves in? BLM supporter also think crazy hear BLM protests didnt cause COVID spread (even people wore masks). protests many people packed together case. also WAY people ‚Äúanti-lockdown‚Äù protests happened.

I think since protesters young healthy, ones caught COVID asymptomatic didnt get tested. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seemed like downplaying adding anything useful conversation. Yes, added population data point, really matter whether relative percentage equivalent bloodiest war America?

I feel restaurants, margins thin it‚Äôs brutal current environment. relatively nimble. go business reform little time. see restaurant shortage little while.

But industries much stuck fixed costs. Like commercial property owners downtown restaurant retail space. wave lease breaking make life difficult may stuck building.

Almost nobody going shop 1 AM. That's whole point like go time, fact remains we're one verrry people store.

In neighborhood would say grocery stores get business 10PM pretty much empty even stay open later night. He‚Äôs factor 3 5.  US well 3,000 day year ends. Would support wearing shirt mask? Im sure US behind EU infections - keeping mind US much smaller population entirety Europe though lot subtleties like testing rates etc play.

United States (231¬†551)

No, instead fake doctor running task force. do. business owners exempt unemployment? article 2018 claim 20 flu deaths El paso OP claims horrifying many people Germany think 40-50 deaths much.... people value human life. never understand, affects themselves. 1 human dead, leaves 10 humans heartbroken.

It‚Äôs neverending shitshow US. 2000 know it....

halloween gonna score 50 point triple double. I've supporting local eateries past seven months. Fortunately, live somewhere tyrannical NY California right. 

Let's pass law locking people apartments. violate law, put prison. There's benefit wearing mask walk sidewalk. exposure time anyone positive little generate infection. stop talk someone, put mask. Agreed.

And one single thing agree people drastically underestimate number flu deaths country. also assume inevitable avoidable. people got flu shots could save tens thousands per year.

Remember: even years shot terribly effective reduce severity, along spread (lower viral load is, less contagious are). One person alone make big difference, everyone 20% less contagious, 34,200 die 2018-2019 (1).  That's almost 7000 mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, etc. would still us.

1. masks sanitized.

You pivoted recent masks reusable masks.

Thank accepting need reuse masks people can't afford new things. It‚Äôs semantics, know. words matter. 

I‚Äôll buy Sweden rest Europe seeing big surge, resurgence, whatever. big rise cases. 

I‚Äôm personally opposed use word ‚Äúwave‚Äù. epidemiologists seems. 

If encountering ‚Äúwave‚Äù, it‚Äôs force nature, something hits without able affect yourself. It‚Äôs way passive me. affect spread. It‚Äôs somewhat hands influence. can‚Äôt influence wave. dunno speaking to, far see, expectation rational people have. growth rate last week previous one (up Saturday) 1.2. Previously growth rate 1.15. flatten yet, last two weeks saw acceleration, yesterday's numbers 25% higher Monday week before, Sunday 19% higher. Covid infectious people contagious show symptoms. That's fine, resources around wanna make life easier you, there's point. Give someone wants let natural selection take place. provided recommendation. citations recommendations. recommendation mandate state Massachusetts. Yes, coming saying ""the president fucked up."" Would've gone great right? immediately sidelined, work done thrown trash? literally coordinates public guidance state level data CDC, incredibly valuable. I'm proud able stay presidents ear long did. someone who's abusive relationship malignant narcissist before, doubt last 6 months worst hell imagine her. 

I hate seeing name dragged mud like this. Wanna know chose work public health? mother raised telling story carelessly caught Spanish flu child, brought home Birx's grandmother, killed her. cares American public health deeply. literally defines person. Yet, wanna trash tabloid level gossip refused take part good country. he's not. clearly said: Tegnell believe second wave Sweden, thus noone else either 

The obvious meaning sentence believes Swedes take risk seriously listened Tegnell said risk lower European countries, lead many becoming infected thus overloading limited testing tracing infrastructure.

You're one playing dense.  little things I'll never take granted again. moved Overston window much made obselete loan support. business open impacted, government pay 65% rent. forced close, government pays 90% rent.  lockdown equivalent banning driving altogether car accidents exist upvotes, later on. Mine too. It‚Äôs concerning. Okay, able find handful online, definetely rare here. really see 24 hour grocery store would viable, many people going shopping 3 justify staffing it? mention hassle stock shelves store open. make sense, please try. couple hours day real reading, Metro, Time, real reading it. may hard, it'll take months, start understand gain understanding scientific thought inquiry instead absorbing media tells you. 1750 Benghazis. waiting surgery, sorry it. putting life hold eight months enough sacrifice slightly extend lives old sick, yeah, I'm back normal. Facts real.

Yea,  bad one actually aware them.

There 522 deaths yesterday, 397 day that. ""entered period"" 1,000 deaths day yet, could call 'sustained.'

New York, state 20 million residents twice many deaths California, state 40 million residents. article didn‚Äôt bother read:


‚ÄúA study published March New England Journal Medicine stated aerosolized coronavirus particles live three hours air, meaning could infect people long expelled. know particles infectious, wearing mask public becomes even critical.‚Äù

I could posted journal article, found media palatable. seems even difficult read. rid excuses extreme cases imparement.

Sounds like want get rid legitimate excuses, like around people. virtually legitimate medical exemption wearing mask mask actually needed. True, saw lot anti-shutdown protesters without masks last spring commend patience.

But really, work pay bills order live. examine type lives want live people. sacrifice humanity, I'm sure want live. Watch video. Shows danger.   Frankly, care personal problems. Centre Evidence-Based mathematically proven incorrect

Such bold words. Whats sad us, uk, etc learned anything next one hits. know yet choose avoid anything ""difficult"" skipping important part? Reusable masks sanitized. That's reiterated enough see going tangent. 

People needed reuse masks 6 months ago. longer issue. Reusable, WASHABLE, SANITIZABLE masks available.

We talking people living poverty availability masks. suggested poor people seek free reusable masks, diverted conversation unhygienic. makes irrelevant suggesting reuse masks can't sanitized. 

Make sense? Brazil huge country, weather north side country south does! :D kids district one area still offering person hybrid know close cases tracked school. Mine virtual, change us. But, stupid ""community involvement"" events high school. One Aqua Zumba, done Saturdays high school pool. high school staffer teaches scheduled October 30th (a day early Halloween) November 7th 14th. notified 30th high school staffer confirmed positive, day cancelled days Aqua Zumba next two November, without telling us staffer was. mighty obvious, HIPAA. problem sport masking exemption state conducted pool, Aqua Zumba is. also allowed Zumba participants use locker rooms students use, cleaning protocols kinda suck due lack staff. 

I fully believe event causes closure schools district. Link? certain someone wins ""go away"". 

He's already claiming victory website rallies. 

If wins, he'll pretend over, mind COVID exists threat Democratic Party. think big issue all.

America well truly screwed. Thankfully South East Asia Africa appear issues virus killing people. area distribution difficult necessary Latin America. hot garbage mawma. can't take graphs showing rate infection, mark mandates enforced claim fall infections afterwards caused it. That's science take variables. 

I could exact thing several graphs European countries, mark mask mandates came claim subsequent rise infections caused masks. See dumb sounds? thing foot.

1/10 Vox. real though, month ago people Chicago still coming lake houses Door County giving fuck. temptation around family. Even though limit gatherings - example birthday part 4 people (2 households) remember hug goodbye blow candles, instead wave cloth. 

I think it‚Äôs easier relax concentration familiar surroundings. Interesting perspective!  sacrifices anyone? Cmon masks definite downsides. Otherwise wouldn‚Äôt need mandate. 

Think deaf people read lips communicate. That‚Äôs one example. word ""resurgence"" literally means second (and subsequent) wave.

You get surge. wanes. get resurgence.

That second wave whether guys want admit not. Exactly. state well! don't. That's complete nonsense. First all, nearly imossible study. Second all, every city different. protests NYC lead increased spread? Probably not. Los Angeles? 100% yes. Hollywood Blvd 100,000 protest super spreading event steroids. People took public tansport, carpooled, carpooled vans etc protest. Mask usage unvieral even 75%. city Los Angeles saw significant spread weeks protest. Mayor admitted protest lead signifcant spread. Yeah don‚Äôt expect huge events like back till summer. won‚Äôt matter say. good chance republicans lose essentially power. I‚Äôm fan get swept today one blame themselves.

And swept fully admit EVERYTHING air signs point Dems taking control senate winning presidency. I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt intelligent, miraculously change standards keep anything open well. It‚Äôs going explode everywhere Xmas. Uhhhh
Positivity 40% 38%
Tests 50k 30k. 1000 deaths day üò¨ that‚Äôs sad. 1000 families affected everyday still people refusing war fucking mask... embarrassing Actually, even drive safely, person road situation COVID - reduce exposure people meet reduce theirs, accidents happen. Except fact medical exceptions still applicable- employers schools ask proof fact medical exception. Guys like reason increasing numbers anti maskers. Oh since cannot explain position, must fault? saw months ago NAB Convention, huge one Vegas, pushed back April 21 October 21.

Which may optimistic, we‚Äôll see. Yeah staff taking masks thing really annoying I've trying keep everyone kitchen acting like they're sitting restaurant mask six feet apart stay seated mask back definitely see especially culture restaurants owners managers really feeling like responsibility.

 there's also problem fucking vented masks I've stop Cooks using. 

As numbers look pretty decent indoor dining there's lot big spreading issues present region change we're looking another shutdown. I'm trying keep Sani possible damned right is. hope get chance sometime come back. Thank well wishes. hope stay healthy well! Good. Teachers country went strike. It‚Äôs stupid open schools. network news mind No, cars necessary infrastructure allow freedom travel work.

Not wearing mask benefits, unless medically exempt. say Trump told that.

Trump told election he'll give absolutely fucks pandemic. cared ahead election hurting polling, paid attention could downplay it. honestly think brief moment rebellious discourse valuable America non-sycophant position? think Dr. Atlas causing significant amount harm.  Dunning-Kruger spent entire childhood suicidal depressed bc outcasted gay. told ugly different. majority 2000s it, said healthy real according science. spent whole life ""abnormal"" fine abnormal now. bc something taboo mean people realize wrong later.

The last years learned ugly met many people found love. cut community imagine gay people without support networks suffering. Straight people fine bc literally every space designed them. spaces us closed. learned important real connection is. 

There life covid rates. Almost entire media, corporate environment, universities, Hollywood, govt might trying call abnormal, know things change every year. know stand side quality life silenced. mean insultingly. rambling make little sense. Seek. Help. It‚Äôs Democrat hoax ruin Donald‚Äôs chances winning election. soon gets he‚Äôs going get number deaths zero, cancelling reporting Covid statistics I'm simply saying people claiming Polio vaccine actually spreading Polio people ridiculed 'antivax conspiracy theorists'. However proven correct. also Africa claims made also India, Philippines, Nicaragua developing nations. happen again. found super gnarly influenzas inside factory farms. wait bad avian flu gets out. child's play. seems bizarre exemption Yeah February things lot better still might early Yeah, gets worse whenever people forced spend time inside. Funny Argentina longest lockdown world number deaths per capita Brazil famously refused lockdown one nations Earth completely open borders. It‚Äôs classic Dunning-Kruger effect. isn't. seriously underestimate difficult working malignant narcissist. guarantee hates Trump much Fauci. better getting ear trying keep it.  fair though, exactly events airlines/public trasport gonna monitor verify vaccinated? everyone vaccinated armbands? Post-vaccination ID/certificate they'll show? flu vaccine also reduces severity disease. Maybe coronavirus vaccine same. brought honestly. Valid point, although 12 European countries higher infection rates doesn‚Äôt mean good job lockdown isn‚Äôt needed. president knows American people rejecting him, exasperating pandemic constant super spreader events get even. Can't wait guy gone gets control, open business, gets control. Repeat. lose-lose. Well studies say idk tell you.  mean insultingly, dont care. things like mean everything, ego all. things important feelings important people think you, sure one them. know stuff, BS useless. Hopefully one day youll pull head MSM ass see light. Unfortunately, theres many like late stop damage thats done, people put effort better future Placating bozo quiet acceptance asinine theories doesn‚Äôt help anyone. Even got fired statements would record. partisan would forced take notice. Yes. That's big if. 

It match reality. argument?

You made assertion chain reusing masks breeding ground surgical masks disposed of. Reusable masks sanitized daily.

And stated original comment, featured medical study regarding surgical masks, irrelevant.

I quoted linked medical paper, NIH.gov website, admitted need people reuse surgical masks methods inventor mask fabrics advised cleaning them.

My point changed original good, people reuse bacterial contamination outside area used masks demonstrated, showed significant correlation microbial air quality working Flu season starting going deal comorbidities covid. 

Even disease airborn, face masks hidden benefit preventing touching face. Yet he's also advocating in-person instruction. understand given nature aerosol transmission. Spoiler:  course exists, significant health hazard people well documented risk groups. numbers greatly inflated doctors apparently get money reporting deaths?

I know, lost track insanely dumb things says know go restaurant order alcohol without food? This. people die Covid car accidents (actually accidents). Wanna compare real stats? I'm game. legacy tarnished forever. Well earned. 

Next slide. True, still right thing do. taking patients neighbours, hospitals full would punish innocent people, government. White House: is. We've eliminated virus. We're gonna spray vaccine sky (disclaimer: bleach taste) Lol, coin shortage issue distribution, issue money shortage lack liquidity. Coins tough keep flowing economy individual care them. Businesses need give coins out, consumers put box ignore them. banks inaccessible coin-counting machines, people going bother returning coins banks open again. Hospitalizations rising sharply. matter time turns ICU admissions deaths.

I'm hoping people start taking seriously flatten curve second wave. expect stop anytime soon, would nice see many people dying back spring. assuming don't. probably grocery shop normal try keep distance. strangers need part give space well they? here? forcing Germany accept transfers.  Alright tell you. literally said nothing feel this. I'm pointing stupid analogy is. 7-day average new cases per day increased 304 September 21 2658 November 2.

That's 774% increase 42 days.

It's fucking easy pinpoint wave began. middle July middle September, 7-day average exceed 300. end September onwards 7-day average increased significantly every week.

[Just looking graph, see second wave started end agree virus exists, poses significant health concern? Well lot restaurants serve alcohol necessarily lump risk group bars.

 
In bars, meant drink drinking comes loss inhibition, less distancing riskier behavior. things greater transmission virus. [citation needed] question, I'm probably misunderstanding something - Coronavirus caught repeatedly, even exposed, stand reason body cannot produce antibodies required prevent repeat infection? case, would inoculation benefit people? injecting virus dead form? cannot create antibodies begin prevent repeat infection - what's point? understand downvotes. 2 ways end virus. Herd immunity (which attained vaccines), complete lockdowns, qould rwquire every single person country stay home literslly contact anyone outside household. Unless happens, always sporadic cases popping end. single vaccine December. running woods isnt gonna impact anyone, lard ass lol like 3 airplanes crashing everyday. Cases steadily increasing Ontario. Hopefully new restrictions put place start show results. Key bit article corresponds Carl Heneghan, director Centre Evidence-Based Medicine University Oxford, today said believed slides shown press conference Saturday suggesting deaths could reach 4,000 day without action wrong.   told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme slides shown ‚Äúbecause mathematically proven incorrect , particularly 4,000 estimate deaths would occur December.‚Äù said data set forecast 1,000 deaths November 1, whereas ‚Äúonly 200 actually occurred‚Äù. two vaccines question one them, Pfizer candidate, require -70C.

You certain. Thats reason mandate. cost verses benefit. home mandate good idea. cost people high reward. cost requiring mask outside house low enough reward ensuring people wearing masks within 6 feet others. simple that. Hallelujah! Praise lord! heaven's light near! There‚Äôs way I‚Äôm eating indoors people right now. still support local places get take head home. Seems conspiracy theory weaves together everything is: covid real infected lot people deadly. Since many people it, lot people die get counted covid death really died something else. cause mortality ""lockdown deaths."" Democrats doctors scientists know hype ""casedemic"" scare people case numbers lock things down. People partly hurt Trump partly like it, reason. rest world also because, dunno, reasons. virus, cOnTrOl. Getting us wear masks somehow part nefarious plot turn us sheep. Yes. wife's teacher. They've normal classes since mid August. yo spreading misinformation?

covid linger air 3 hours..... non-ventilated cold room, aka hospital bed surgery room. since that‚Äôs place they‚Äôve noticed lingering long.

it‚Äôs going hang around air 3 hours OUTSIDE. go buy cigarette, joint, vape whatever. take hit release smoke indoors outdoors. 

indoors see slowly moves around room, outdoors see immediately goes within seconds completely dissipated. We‚Äôd 2 million infections per day hit 5000 deaths day, isn‚Äôt possible. I'm wearing masks requiring people wear mask even one else around counter productive. Okay, last couple weeks many positive voices vaccines, several countries already getting ready distribute vaccinate. even named vaccines distributed, detailed distribution plans available. results announced Phase III, wonder already know vaccines tested effective, cannot say formally yet? I'm bit confused. basically Herd Immunity Hubris hell drug. defend (I'm really trying to), making suggestion asking self-restriction much easier forcing implementation. threaten enforce general population show self restraint. understand thought process, though still completely agree it. restaurants also serve alcohol looked many people get tested every day VS then? shit back June testing increased rapidly, everyone ignored furthering points agendas.

Number infected doubt going up, can't use graph measure growth ""Gypsy give yoyr tears, take you!"" problem people assumed Trump top secret intel giving us advice according intel.

He gave opposite advice. sounds like good news indeed, bring on! Generally speaking, leaving toddlers alone home frowned upon - parents errands do, sometimes toddler come along. worth, babies, complaining wearing masks? course not, never existed. However families people supposedly dead covid exist paid actors, also doctors nurses fake well, actually don‚Äôt exist. doctors actually Fauci exceedingly complex costumes trying misdirect attention. friends got either asymptomatic mild cold symptoms. Theyre fine now.

Most people arent risk virus. South Korea nearly police state, there's lot censorship, surveillance government control due technically on-going war North Korea. helpful pandemic (stopping hoaxes spreading, monitoring people's movement, etc). one good enough. get better one later research done various side effects rare interactions documented planned for. Get first approved one access to, generally safe - that's 3 phases meant ascertain (not sure exact angles covered phase). fair war lasted around 1,000 days; total deaths around 480,000 31 million 1 65. would really impressive organize unified effort across nations cultures.

Of course is. foolproof way stop transmission outdoors either. reducing likelihood transmission, masks would home too.

I traced spread protest people carpooled van. six people got covid. spread around others protest? Highly likely. impossible trace.

But places like NYC rise cases protests. likely getting protests require people enclosed space like car. lot people walked protests lived.

... that's compound growth looks like.

It makes mad hell one explains exponential curve. Even account artificially high number due half nursing homes last 4 days still high number deaths. Shit carries may surpass daily deaths first wave right thing. got really lucky - youngest graduated June. would refused send back in-person. (TBF believe LAUSD still online.) made up?

No, wasn‚Äôt made it, it‚Äôs feature senate house bills.

American doctors paid relative prevailing wages America, hourly basis, primary care doctors America don‚Äôt actually make much. plans put forth house senate seek reduce primary care compensation commodify labor. 

And distinct feature bills exploit fact doctors legally cannot unionize America.

So it‚Äôs great countries plans don‚Äôt exploit labor, exact plan US socialized medicine written bills physicians exploited.

Not bullshit, fears, literally written bill.

Why would anyone negotiate that? own? full intent bill written make doctors accept rates choice. Nearly direct quote person wrote house bill.

Again, whole plan based exploitation labor, it‚Äôs non-starter.

You care American people, get bill recognizes actual cost physician labor establishes union looks interests. then, one taking M4A deal Americans continue go without. ... someone obviously neglected duty supervision.

If kid left alone long enough choke mask, would plenty time kill ways / choke things. 15 cases right go zero soon.

Whatever happened migrant caravans seem storm border every election? hoping find implementation details article... Using increments 10 way logical american units sad thing see much money lol That's whole Trumpload deaths every day, absolutely insane still arguing even real third country they're lmao

You think holding BLM sign makes virus give fuck? Oh, really infected? thought ruse say sniffles. aware United States 7000 people die every day? many 1000 also comorbidity flu Covid flu? think important questions ask ""experts "". 
I talking Joe Biden. /s

But seriously nailed this.
Biden 2020. mean vaccine get submitted approval waiting that? Okay well I'll go eat then. Oh yes good

It's bad. Belgium nearing capacity, already reached it. another weeks going lot less empty beds. We're getting close ""deciding lives dies"" scenario everyone's worried about. see good this. very, very, bad. ~530 deaths day. Equivalent 2,600 US deaths. 
EDIT: Kindly corrected outrider567 also changed reporting need check excess mortality We're talking complex DNA comparisons anything. simple ""looks like we've sir, tested positive, negative, positive again. Let's double check that.""

And there's proof completely ignorant process involved confirming reinfection case.

Good day sir. ~~people followed~~ **gov't enforced** guidelines

FTFY Nah, P&amp;O round Norwegian fjords. fair scenery outstanding. go take walk Would consider gamer? think would like wear mask even house, neither anyone else showing symptoms. get you. whole situation even wack now. Wait vaccine. 15% really high number, either. It‚Äôs going disastrous lame duck session. Trump rage burn everything around can. Stay tuned three months post scientific article showing immunity last nine months missing point. December know vaccine safe not. That's huge progress we've gotten nothing year many people already given up. Even vaccine safe, vaccines far behind That‚Äôs true...except recently we‚Äôve low green scrubs use blue nursing scrubs sometimes. That‚Äôs trick he‚Äôs using! Could provide sources information? good, site edited title made post anything wrong. Children died choking masks Please inform works, then. don‚Äôt even need master anything, well rounded scope knowledge lot different things without expert them. that‚Äôs also pretty much impossible without critical thinking skills many people lack entirely Same, coworkers work safety. horrifying. truly feel like Facebook banned. read shit reinforces anger, brings hate contempt. stupid fucking social media fire point stroke feel like regurgitating garbage happen way say like bragging  We've done right? need proof vaccination travel countries Maybe meant type ""infection point"" matter what, biden win's still 2 week lag well uptick covid testing. al republicans like ""see biden made worse"" still fighting masks, coughing spiting people make worse spite. none actually believe that.

They incomprehensibly stupid; overestimating them.

There's logic inner monologue. ""believe"" shit. literally ""us vs them"" anything explicitly reaffirm existence bad/lies/fake news etc.

We see world % people. Literally nothing happens anything said would ""convince"" them, mentally incapable convinced.

We stop giving idiots much credit. ignore (as best can) give little voice possible. Reasoning convincing wasted breath/energy. ""Now we're really picking speed"" Wisconsin gave up. Absolutely nothing done stop spread. Load 'em bars, weeks later load 'em hospitals. point Wisconsin nothing vs COVID seems like criminal negligence manslaughter. Unfortunately numbers continue increase regardless new policies they'll claim Trump control Biden unleashed population. Much sociopathic though. There's point contributing right particular, never ever okay ""data are"". entire scientific community shove it. ""data is"". Nobody speaks like nobody write like that. 


Neat article though. yes, joking tracking athlete's foot convenience store, holy shit. change fact literal actual laws making cover parts public spaces already we've fine it. sometimes even health safety reasons, vague moral ones. way long i've alive, slippery-sloped anything sinister seriously protested, think mask arguments somewhat specious.  Whatever say pal... 
I'll let history judge. ;) bad lot people listen flu. mask mandates working cases keep going up. small amount people wear masks make cases go much saying. Masks compromise immune systems work Imagine horns started growing heads! 

We would rethink hats. Woah, I‚Äôm talking inland. I‚Äôm talking tiny strip land water people money go retire. You‚Äôd assume approval would follow pretty quickly - especially it‚Äôs almost certain one vaccines either Moderna Pfizer‚Äôs (or even both). I've already explain family we're going traditional Thanksgiving year. I'm trying find someone comes clever idea celebrate safely, get feeling pitching people still quite seem taking pandemic seriously going losing proposition. Stephen Hawking: sad robot noises Im going chime article say also may fail people symptoms, covid symptoms took one test hospital admitted, one test negative, couldnt figure caused cytokine storm /covid symptoms.

One test alone may false negative.... blame you.

This absolute nonsense making actual argument either. declaring coherent reasons defense. Positivity rate problem hitting 20, 30, 40% cases high enough (see Europe) cant give up? see us giving stop washing hands, wearing masks, practicing social distancing, means another lockdown way giving up, well.....

What makes think haven't? I've watched Dr Griffin TWIV talk case reference article. I've seen news woman Dallas felt sick twice never followed on. check [reinfection regularly. use ole search engine topic every while, find info pretty consistent unique stories rare.

As mentioned earlier, personal stake whether reinfection likely, obviously I'm curious, evidence I've found (anecdotal otherwise) points currently rare problem.

If point source talks ideally links news (fuck even reddit comments about) least say hundred separate confirmed even ""unconfirmed tested"" reinfections, I'll start consider valid argument. think resource would exist now, right?

Unless 'a important issue' recent stuff Poland stuff went months ago. It‚Äôs mental illness point. It‚Äôs really scary. time month ago, Coronavirus data suggested India's latest outbreak would make king infections end October. Even did, US infection rate death rate would still worse.

You durrr thats dumb funny, looks like never even went school buddy. keep pushing agenda. Get better Ontario bro potentially troubling. TMC, probably regularly exposed virus. normal immune response, exposed, generate antibodies. antibody levels remain high continually challenged virus exposure. there's drop antibodies even continual challenge...oi...that's good. restaurant sitting near people couple hours talking, often drinking, continuously exposed. Infection function time sum total viral dose exposed to. typically sit someone 2 hours mall, walk past them. Sitting next someone train/bus/plane much problematic subject lots discussion research spreading events planes, need wear mask situations minimum, really avoided whenever possible (hard shut since people need get work -- problematic since we're economically forcing low-paying essential workers expose risk transportation, etc, etc, etc).

That rose garden event, even though outside, seems become spreading event packed together people socializing grip+grin going on.

You could theoretically completely eliminate virus 2-3 weeks could get 100% isolation. islands done this.

I think many areas US could complete lockdown. also think that, virus gone area unchecked, get second wave. think NY NJ seen second wave, got first early.

Overall cases among entire US going second third wave, varies lot area. cities states getting first time, others not.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* attitude heard too! like life raft someone poking holes saying ‚Äúwe going drown anyway‚Äù 

Hope effort keep loved ones safe control chaos. hope fair well sweet soul. safe. care. not? could forecast 5million dead January 1 make fancy chart. 

If lockdown 5mil dead, that's proof lockdowns worked. 

Or could skip lockdowns, one point future nation realize everyone knows least one person died covid19. 

IMO, matter numbers 3-months-from-now forecast displays. nothing get worse week. answered you. great day. France taking action drastically reduce number. Praise Lord science!! There! HHS Secretary. Mattis Defense again... Yesterday, 520. day before, 394. 2 days before, 950.

Sure seems like sustained 1000.  I‚Äôm American hate American centricity reddit , mean number. critical covid patients require intensive 24/7 care, could almost say one patient needs one staff member time, checking them, giving meds, cleaning them, comforting them, feeding them,

But 8 months prepare this, right? study shows BCG safe, cost-effective treatment introduced standard care patients moderate Covid-19 reduce requirement oxygen supplemented beds disease burden low resource countries, additional long-term benefits reducing risk tuberculosis. I‚Äôm seriousness, hear you. Same. I‚Äôve tempted sign clinical trial chance getting vaccine... debating anything. asked question. Florida drop 10th place tomorrow, 11th place soon Nebraska Arkansas virus rates growing faster Florida's there. Medication tool ‚Äúnext therapy‚Äù. know game. Health Insurance keep many doctor receiving paychecks - one done affair, thered need health insurance.....

Its bad thought wallets prior death. Well you‚Äôre allowed get go bathroom. models?

Sources, bullshit. we're finding now? remember everyone spring immediately concerned babies born women infected covid, really studies effect pregnant women whole time? gamble resulted Covid death rate ten times Norway. ..for war..i mean national security. governments don‚Äôt know data. people charge expanding trials don‚Äôt know data. Data Safety Monitoring Board knows data, required keep secret, blinded. Again, blinding works. time machine would fight urge go fight younger self. Dewine needs mandate work home it. reason sit office every day work home.  Closing eat restaurants would help well.  

I feel hopeless.  see many friends getting together homes, going eat, parties...  dont see part problem.  Sigh. Alright. think IFR isn‚Äôt concerning more.

Now give shit it‚Äôs real drag wife come home day coded patients. Florida exactly know smartest people america either. exactly many people fed feel like toyed with. thing stopping going full conspiracy nut fact scripted kind stupidity callousness lead us path. stop pretending world run people care us, lives worth almost nothing them, cannon fodder. makes even frustrating frame constantly changing guidelines rules good. borrow Forest Gump: Selfish selfish does. outcome consistent research areas, attitudes toward environmental conservation.  use fewer resources order save money, sake environment. years away herd immunity NYC? 1% IFR far 10 times deadlier flu.

And since 0.32% NYC died 6 weeks, we're saying 20% city puts IFR outbreak (remember, using early ventilation then) way higher 1%. It'll hit people 'having deal consequences' Benghazi killed 4 people *never* stop screaming that, clearly number deaths clearly doesn‚Äôt phase people. pick choose look COVID list notable... Live here, imo, never taken seriously many kind tolerated. Now, done worrying it. Heard one yesterday, ""we're going get point. "" note, fox news Rush Limbaugh consumer youre child. vulgar one that.

edit: nice fellow man. never know might run someone give something back might regret.

Broken record... stuff conspiracy nuts shouting back April 1984

FTFU life? Making witty comments someone posted rhetorical comment article?

This best life? 

Really? 

Broken record... beds usually problem, hospital staff is, mean number. critical covid patients require intensive 24/7 care, could almost say one patient needs one staff member time, checking them, giving meds, cleaning them, comforting them, feeding them, icu means intensive really keep eye patient like mother newborn. covid unfortunately sends several percent covid patients icu veentilators, huge number hundreds thousans getting sick one country. average western country anywhere 1 per 10,000 citizens 1 per 1,000 icu beds, 0.01 0.1% coverage, covid 5% critical rate. proof that? literal record access hospital computers? 

Dr Deborah Brix (Coronavirus Response Coordinator White House) says ..

[""anyone dies Covid counted Covid Dr. Ngozi Ezike (director Illinois Department Public Health) also says thing ..

[""Technically even died clear alternate cause, Covid time, still listed Covid would saying that? Around 1.7 million people New York City infected coronavirus disease shown spreading first confirmed case reported eight months ago, new study found. 6 foot deep holes. They'd use heavy equipment dig hundred pits gets bad. Hopefully get bad round people homeless elderly.

I'd guess blow-burn effect COVID-19 cause K shape economic curve would allow people make money others live poverty maybe cheap source labor Trump wins Republicans remain control US Senate. long run COVID-19 probably like flu pandemic 1918, still remain even treaded vaccines. sure hope things get worse. Timely... might one set people get regards ventilation. proof that? literal record access hospital computers? 

What kind psycho think someone sick gets shot died would say sickness? We're getting close ""deciding lives dies"" scenario everyone's worried about.

They said going happen Sweden though, too. Brazil. India.

And seems happened happened. fearful, let alone frantic. knowing close zero chance still greater zero. What's wrong someone reduce chance even further?

We focus spreading virus most. Wiping surfaces certainly hurt. going make fact indoor dining open basically everywhere us. Including places schools closed.  way could spend even money health care system. countries try it.

Other countries do! Thanks. here's 2 cents.

If list consequences infected, list bad consequences really long risk death, risk long term health issues, risk infecting others on. list good consequences really one thing, likely kind immunity.

To chase single good consequence bad strategy. However, already know lot deaths on, surely hope also lot people hit jackpot immunity. turned out, Stockholm even get that, disappointed fact eyes rather expected.

It surely whould better fact shitty spring immunity larger, would least silver lining. summer even problem, issue slowly climbing numbers last two three months got completely ignored. plenty warning would get bad plenty time counteract, nothing done control again. Seem like politics still understand exponential functions. Remember moving mass SC blown away difference. Sometimes live border town faster go German hospital opposed one country. americanest comment ever readed. Yep it‚Äôs made bits real panther know it‚Äôs good. Conservative governments always big individual freedoms, they're unprecedented, that's there's big uproar behind scenes backbenchers think Boris team much. really lifted social distancing rules since March, made fundamental mistakes August September we're paying price now, they've consistently tried lower transmission whilst giving us freedom, respect that, wish they'd accept virus allow type freedom we're used to.

They awfully slow improve ppe, mask mandates improve testing, best testing Europe, getting better we're wonders vaccine treatment trials. 340mil potential vaccine doses population 67mil brilliant planning them, hopefully vaccines we're signed successful.

Don't get wrong they've still slow probably listen scientific experts more, I'm saying disaster government, even though undoubtedly could done better No, can't ever say ""a data"". 

The issue grammar purists note technically data plural datum. Meaning ""grammatical"" correct version is, ""the data are"", ""the data show"", ""this datum is"". However, people speaking non academic writing say ""the data is"", ""the data shows"", ""this piece data is"", ""this data point is"". 

Essentially, regular folks treat data like ""school fish"". school fish refers plurality fish, group fish, would say ""the school fish is"" ""the school fish are"". 

So overly formal settings original ""intended"" grammar used, feels unnatural people read it. 

I passionate issue. I'm tech space see time, always obstinately refuse say ""data are"". know believe. one side basically every scientist Doctor people like 50 y/o lady met yesterday. self-proclaimed ""political researcher"" studied ancient history determined covid business nothing Marxist movement. 

It's hard know trust anymore. 1) clear idea ""spreadable distance"" especially different weather conditions

2) would also benifitical wear mask car also.

3) fact say understand someone seeing running would good would encourage run maybe also understanding wearing mask important dumbfounding me. Like fuck cognitive dissonance coming from? Uh, think nation, especially one claims global leader, take another nation's word face value, may stupider I've assumed. 

The funny thing that, I, normal citizen travel around time work colleagues travel China, aware danger mid January. 

We also know US government well aware dangers point. would even better information sack US pandemic team ground there, certainly knew danger.

But sure, I'm blind one. Lol, fucking dumbass (no, that's ad hominem claim ignorance, I'm insulting dumb blind ass).

Edit:

You also answer Japan, Korea, Vietnam classified part generalizations. asians brand Chinese you? WTF??? fact people falsify vaccination records baffles me. hope mask wearing becomes normalized Western counties expected anything less Germany. best class quality life, best class living cost salary, best class health system, best class management pandemic. unlike Belgium, that's like retarded kid multiple personality disorder, also surprised biggest number cases per capita already system collapse. hope get much worse. Big respect Germany. see people put (sorry formatting. mobile) comments... 2 weeks ago said converting National Stadium field hospital.

Are actually using P1: ‚ÄúNuh uh- died heart failure‚Äù

P1: ‚Äú yup heart failure‚Äù south Florida, old people are, time stay outside.  probably can't make would motivation get loan

Uhhh, get loan, pay back 66% immediately pocket 34% free money? single-dose vaccine could game changer developing countries, especially J&amp;J's manufacturing capacity understand mean illness, God need stop using CP acronym shit.  I‚Äôm getting political debate sub. It‚Äôs easy find articles her. Here‚Äôs one:[Inside Trump‚Äôs Failure: Rush Abandon Leadership Role tested 22,000 today 27% positive. fact they‚Äôre expanding trials left right &amp; governments buying vaccines let‚Äôs know I‚Äôm not. linked entire last paragraph increase documented. People wondering affects increases isn‚Äôt needed increase already point. feeling that. Try start new post show point based feelings. I‚Äôm still waiting source. coronavirus symptoms, get tested. Coronavirus symptoms similar common cold sometimes. yes, get tested. bad could do? flu vaccine targets protein coating inconsistent year year depending dominant strain, whereas Covid vaccine targets protein spikes seem pretty consistent variant strains.  Covid vaccine depend recipient viral strain.  least that‚Äôs understand it. knows. single death tragedy. million statistic. sadly turning new normal.

If wear seatbelt, wear mask. people die Covid-19 year car accidents US. 3rd leading cause death currently. guess also wrap head around 330 million Coronavirus proofreading mechanism lowers mutation rate allows larger genome.

Flu one mutation around per additional cell infection, Coronavirus per additional person infection (orders magnitude less).

There many rapidly changing flu strains hard predict best targeted vaccine year, seems coronavirus stable. pfizer's also double dose right? think two-shot vaccines. Can't imagine ü§∑ recently family share plandemic plandemic 2. anyone resources specifically debunking videos? Everyone FL cheap gaudy shit. I'd rather shop NE.   Data singular plural, like moose? know anyone wash hands toilet. Surveys always something take grain salt. know went ask lol. even says article, results debatable. use sort evidence, please. sociopath. Europe warning signal though. Italy started shutting down, wake call US. I'm Northeast area got hit hard first wave. hard imagine things getting bad did. expect Northeast get spike expect us get deaths first wave. Northeast never opened like Europe summer though. lot things still closed still are. Whereas, Berlin literally tons open air clubbing, theater music events, door dining open days ago (I'm visiting boyfriend here). 

I'm saying expected better. actually surprised things worse given observed Europe (people relaxed). mean general, people tend expect better re: Europe given variety factors. 

Not European countries badly, obviously. Nordic countries, part well Germany, considering geography, actually badly one would expect (I know might age badly though...we'll see two weeks).

I still expect US worse overall end. pandemic exposed huge flaws. bad healthcare, general, unless wealthy...but epidemic obesity. mention, never truly lockdown way Asia testing tracing joke. least, say various European governments, tried bit (especially seeing locking now). 2021 conspiracy Big Calendar I'm sorry hear that. condolences.

Your right unfair. Baker worked insurance business entered politics; insurance, field finely assessing risks proceeding action. would make sense Baker listening scientific experts matter, basing actions recommendations.  left free market, they'd charge 2000 pop lol. Torrent person people talking about?

And btw, guy also posted bunch subs different languages. looks like joining Fauci gang election comes close. That‚Äôs embarrassing  I‚Äôm South Florida people wear masks store bars open cruises starting explanation social media internet amplify stupid minority project onto everyone shares common beliefs.  Yes! Look Replesta supplement. take 1 waffle month winter months boost Vit D. Viruses pretty high get perfect hit rate. Measles chicken pox get close norovirus, far contagious COVID, often wipe completely. Dude never even required gyms masks reopened 2.5 months.

I'm happy lift fucking idiots put on. amount help going fix people. I'm therapy now. therapists started talking medication. said, ""what fuck medication going make feel happy isolated, alone, broke, spending holidays alone?"" 

Swear fucking god normal happy situation. Talking medication going fix that. feel like people want others doped can't tell ass hands. Okay, know necessary put backslash mean sarcasm. But, look username think sarcasm implied. Sorry confusion. Won‚Äôt people areas restrictions go areas don‚Äôt restrictions?

France current 7 day moving average deaths/day = 345 equivalent 1,616 deaths/day US

The US current 7 day moving average deaths/day 849. France seeing people die nearly 2X pace US Nothing said proven links provided. I'm one ignore conspiracy theories, know conspiracies happening left right today's world.

But need evidence. Show that, could go there. Gee wonder 'Awful. And, number people hospitalised daily basis country went around 50 August, 200 September, 700 october, 1,000 last week October, looked November. see coming. 'Absolute distaster.

Don't give GrAnDma bullshit. People start killing left right. them? people whose life even started yet. someone put Trump's face George Bluth he's driving truck ""rounding"" corner. sounds great. 

I guess silver lining cloud. Could used medicines diseases? Would reached level functionality COVID around? stuff I‚Äôve seen, Canada apparently pre-order AZ vaccine 20m doses purchased January they‚Äôre ready deployed data reviewed approved. 

I *think* Canada slightly behind AZ vaccine deployment compared UK (but ahead USA due delay). can‚Äôt really guess regards Pfizer/Moderna health officials said, target seems late Q1 2021 vaccination program risk.  better number 7 day moving average since France reports nursing home deaths bunches. 

Worldometers yet updated today number yesterday 345 equvalent 1,616 deaths/day US 

The US current 7 day moving average deaths/day 849. France seeing people die nearly 2X pace US I'm fucking suicidal. phone disconnected yesterday. lost job months ago. gig work pay shit. I'm student even want work anymore.

I'm terrified dad hoping avoid till vaccine. He's #essential 68. lol, about? I've heard countries/regions/stores struggling meet demand, think that's fabulous xD  study came 6 months ago, we've seen it, I've making masks using cotton stretch chiffon since then. anything newer come recently? want make sure chiffon still considered good filtration option.

Similarly, studies include chiffon? hate basing fabric choices single study. think mean antibodies, T-cells. Checkmate Spoiler: probably yes.

I'm trade show industry things May canceled.  Well that‚Äôs get elect idiots cowards lead country. Cherry picking articles doesn‚Äôt make right. 
Putting economy bounce back human lives disgusting. know far away vaccine is, we‚Äôll listen science safe keep loved ones safe. first wave many places Europe worse first wave US every place NYC. Since, US steady cases without overwhelming hospitals Europe yo yos. really know ""expect better"". assume cities people would get healthier? new strain called 20A.EU1 Spain occured July responsible surge since July. spread travelers Europe UK (and Italy, Netherlands etc.) responsible 60 percent new cases now. even detected New Zealand. don¬¥t know spread Asia USA contagious definitely. Entering?

If factor excess deaths, we‚Äôve **been** sustaining rate start. Come *on*, fucking worthless headline. guys making thankful kids school district. went back second got positive cases, immediately went back hybrid. still perfect, better nothing.

It middle/high school, half daughter's 4th grade class quarantined. sick well(although, honestly, I'm pretty sure much halloween candy.) stuck home til gets results covid test. We've got biggest corners, they're beautiful, Democrats never seen turn wide, tried it, got see soon. gonna beautiful.  Impossible watched president tell rounding curve since March. /s rest 70%? Dont 3 states basically population 30% country? 

Most new yorks deaths months ago didnt know anything virus. Since June average 20 per day. leaves 980 deaths day rest country.

The uptick middle America. would lot easier cooperation. 

Idk sort gotcha you. Cuomo fucked early corrected course, average infection rate around 1.5. basically back 100% open around except restaurants schools less people dying per day vast majority states. 

What state ask? curious infection/death rate is. usual Sweden seems like reactive instead proactive, I'm afraid new restrictions coming late. hope turn around though #1 spot country highest death rate week like May:

- Sweden highest death rate per capita country world week, data many people died COVID-19 Sweden, considering they're already one hardest hit countries *entire* world, current infection rate looks really bad them.  also think would work lot better. short strict lockdown semblance normalcy theres lockdown. Personally perceived summer pretty much normal germany dont think dropping rules completely would‚Äôve made much change infections-wise instead could increased compliance another lockdown fired better yet, jail?

""The World Health Organization recommended three layers non-medical masks since June.¬†When pressed sudden change Canada,¬†Tam said research evolved."" Oh? How'd that? literally said that. look, said vaccine wouldn‚Äôt ready Trump would push. Michigan here. We‚Äôre stupid together. mean really. first thought was, duh. I‚Äôm curious, ever taken Econ 101 course?

Because believe scarcity like believing 2+2=4.

And I‚Äôll bet claim believe science. Frequent test seems main strategy now. :

""All people working high risk professions (doctors, nurses, anyone working pandemic prevention, dock workers, etc etc) PCR tested two weeks check flare ups. recent outbreaks caught kind routine testing really showing value.

When outbreak happens, area affected put movement restriction (basically lockdown country China, China real lockdown much strict) entire population tested week. positive cases, close contacts close contacts close contacts quarantined centrally managed facilities cut transmission chain. Areas movement restriction stand alert there's 14 days straight positive cases.

With current situation Kashgar, entire population 4.5 million tested 3 days. 2nd round full population PCR test underway. may 3rd round."" people still argue even real not. capable empathizing humans. Republican voters sociopaths, can't. get riled bombing brown people, though. know live planet actions affect others (including descendants).


‚ÄúSociety grows great old men plant trees whose shade know shall never sit in.‚Äù Thank you!!! Came find/say this. much larger attack rate vaccines meaning casualties generally 20-40x more, even more. ""Fuck.""

I realize guys like see value playing nicely others, would actually make things like easier would. Boom! one right here! Welp, happen? Stop messing about.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I‚Äôm sure good news. kind think happened month ago Trump would win US election landslide. Maybe cynical though. Hold on, scarcity matter trump does?  So, rich idiot said/posted something idiotic??

 
My surprise! shock!! OMG!

/S political president United States blamed deaths due virus?

Here's play out....

People keep getting sick vaccine developed put use.....or ""herd immunity"" reached. risk. Even people stay home. wear masks practice safe distancing still get virus. 

I expect come it. 70, pleasant thought. believe probably unintentionally spread others. also believe good chance surviving healthy good shape. going let Covid-19 run life. Yeah wouldnt catch honkytonk farmboy ass going near shit.

I might start wearing spray suit grocery store see happens. Communism gobment things feel like article comes every week I'm fan hands tied. Without federal stimulus shutdown destroys state. Literally wrote agree. Go right ahead. headline says patient ""flown in"", sounds like matter proximity. So, keeping mind much Belgian-German border national park, border towns mind?  Pretty weird both:

1) make personal attack
2) look accurate data void correlation asset other. You‚Äôre pointing black calling white. 

If really believe you‚Äôre saying, please calculate coefficient. Spoiler: scientists already peer reviewed really think Nancy Pelosi runs Europe? hard time believing important people whispering... actual source. links anything, emotional horseshit coming trying paint protesters bad light. 

LA tremendous job handling virus fell pieces restaurants bars never shut people coming states refused mask. ACTT SOLIDARITY numbers indicate remdesevir probably useful patients. problem given early progression disease, possibly even typical hospitalizion testing currently certainly really know needed. Reducing mortality one quarter among people 5% IFR requires far doses per life saved reducing one quarter among people 50% IFR. bright side, guess, already dex latter combine two. ........ Hey - can't stop living. 

Yes. take precautions going stop living. people criticizing going dates. going live like hermit. might go years. Good. things go well enough happen sometime future, I'm sure made happen fast enough please everyone. collapse sub worst. depressing. facts lol research evolved

This utterly infuriating, ""experts"" resign accord catastrophically bad leadership. really need wait ""the research evolve"" tell public mask outset respiratory pandemic? Trillions dollars, millions lives, could avoided no-brainer advice rest us, fortunate countries better leadership, grasped immediately.

If accept level mediocrity leaders, suppose deserve. country basically whole medical system cold drive. Meaning first exams anything emergency canceled.

And people still trying protest saying wear masks live normal, go partying etc.

The way get doctor phone doctor decides need exam person come see them. means basically can't get doctor phone call whole day pray pick up.

I recently gotten really sick got ""try relax get plenty sleep get better go private practice"". mean... afford private doctors pay specialists literally work due covid 19.

After time getting better telling go psychiatrist sleep wrong many levels. asked doctor ""So normal constantly sick puke 2 weeks?"" tells ""Well exactly is.""

Luckily recovering problems stress related mad people can't give 2 3 things life months. Jesus would people live 5 years war like parents 20 years ago. Brats! half brain. explained covid spread people attending protests. Don‚Äôt even need aggressive. workers walking around full hazmat suits sanitizing foggers offering covid tests, klieg lights, loudspeakers announcing entering high virus area.. Cities aren‚Äôt even trying. convince people gather scary public health theater. plenty warning would get bad plenty time counteract, nothing done control again

So would say reflects European medical community handling this?

You think doctors polticians forgot Covid Second Wave? let's say ppl get vaccinated u do. good folks vaccinated refuse social distance would pass one another. right? folks got vaccinated would sit back laugh. right? Americans one homogenous group.

Contrast California, Oregon, Washington - best management COVID world Texas Louisiana. Dallas county also people states. terrible idea babies currently. 

Some people option wait. Fertility decreases birth defects/complications increase get older. Here‚Äôs link source Masks open bring benefit - medically proven. political posturing. Trump outs Dr Fauci lets whatever medical stooge takes over, might hearing propaganda masks useless cause COVID. Fuuuuck suspect Europe eventually arrive. would great schools could kept open, likely driving infections much.  evidence would appear support conclusion...... Old people still people died early, even though Trump people keep saying ""well, deaths old people!"" Decent article guess news source unable get name passenger properly ‚Äúout‚Äù them?

People act like assholes like need vilified publicly. France European stringent requirement consider someone recovered? Almost 90% cases considered active European countries around 50% countries 25%. heard first 5G network near France many deaths/day US even though US almost 5x population. Pretty easy find.  dad likes point definition, half country average intelligence. That‚Äôs painfully, frighteningly obvious lately Making actually effective would start... Anyone else read ""sustainable period""? actually refunded ticket, surprisingly. solar makes cents funny conservatives obsessed notion scarcity shortage everything.

Build production facilities.  Make stuff.  Make pie. HAPPENING think people calculate excess deaths unaware population growth fail account that?

Well read whole methodology CDC arrives excess deaths. nothing population growth certainly nothing age dont think ""Excess Deaths"" normally used examine medical phenomenon *as happening* like people Covid. dont think statistic meant used way.

And fine print methodology pretty much tells this. says none information final 12 months passed. someone still know mask required flights airlines, person must living rock past 7 months. title alone belongs r/mildlyinfuriating Florida going petri dish tonight since everyone voting person. get ticket value returned charged anything.

I'm going limb maybe learned lesson - whatever fuck wants there's consequences. say wha?  Shocked. can‚Äôt believe Southwest Airlines refunded ticket. pay everyone else‚Äôs tickets causing disruptive delay missed connections. I've pretty strict wearing masks everywhere even required got covid :(

Fortunately think wearing mask lessened impact viral load. hospitalized anything, absolutely mild symptoms fun. can't imagine worse mask use Again? 


LOL, surprise there, sadly. :( Yeah, lower, world. That's said, haha. got 4:30 STILL second person line waiting polls open 7am. want lower exposure make sure first ones there. Reference: See, trump right good shape come Easter... /s Yup, would much preferred harder lockdown early enforced isolation people coming dont deal endless sortof lockdown bs people feel like trying part. Refused Wales went circuit breaker lockdown... longer follow news /that/ closely, far recall Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine similar flu vaccine based introducing body small piece dead virus. Oxford/Astrazeneca emerged pretty quickly contender vaccines discussion all, since working one since days MERS, close cousin COVID-19. 

Regarding Moderna/Pfizer, experimental ones. based ""mRNA,"" include dead piece virus (so far understand it). paper explains mRNA detail, although particular COVID Moderna/Pfizer vaccines.

Over last months, seems like problem finding vaccine ""works,"" testing one works well/the best. Well mean adds it. Someone going pay stuff one day make habit going outside wear mask. Pulling taking causing get infected more.  Thank you, even noticed.  Oh hardly - even anywhere near 2008 bailout territory  No? idea Dan vs ScoMo false. Victoria lockdown protected Sydney's economy likely something agreed upon. narrative ""Dan going rogue"" political crap Sky News wanted push.

If need stats tell plenty businesses survive 6 month lockdown paying rent tells got zero experience anywhere near running business. Reported misinformation. Oh, it‚Äôs hard judge him. gets pass. get it. source numbers? really seem like something could easily quantify. IFR really theoretical know true numbers infections. IFR definitely vary 2 right circumstances though, main springs mind health system becomes overloaded, New York Italy. 240 isn‚Äôt *that* far Hospitals overwhelmed 3-2-1... reasons wouldn‚Äôt entitled like example. first pass government takes word. apply goes employer say good firing pay certain amount extra duration unemployment. employer say quit actively trying work would fire multitude reasons. 

Now unemployed person wants pursue provide information employer respond info. time consuming process come correct answer.

(And part originally asked ideas improve process) remember video doctor wearing mask ran show dangerous know Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi main issue stimulus? Happy cake day! Sane people need heavy authoritarian response. would authority.

The biggest threat freedom people abusing freedom harmful society. nudged take away.  clarify, he‚Äôs vaccine, he‚Äôs favor it, he‚Äôs seriously hypocritical, wants force (or least pressure) everyone take won‚Äôt take himself. agree. son got tested today quarantine. I'm losing roughly $1300/in two weeks this. Weeks Christmas. still rent pay too. Shit sucks absolutely idea. Hahahaha made day! live Kirkland tell absolute worst governor. let people come go facility absolutely nothing. wonder rate hospitalization compared positive tests? Hopefully vast majority kids bounced back fine. also mandated 2 weeks sick leave permanent staff (unfortunately casuals), free testing healthcare, decent social security Government put business support keep workers employed.

There seems massive fear ""socialism"" states see capitalism, capitalism minimum basic standard living ensured.

The article say grocery store workers good source community transmission, that's probably right, unlikely takes form infecting customers. said that, still good idea hang grocery store long required.

The Solidarity trial, article says refutes remdesivir, indicated reduce mortality rate, reduce proportion patients discharged 7 days hospitalization.

So see contradiction two trials; results seem perfectly compatible. agree reduce mortality rate, one says reduces average recovery time says effect recovery time 7 day mark.

What's problem here? spent 15 minutes lecturing doctor infectious diseases...? Roughly 133 gallons. bad. Independent even tabloid.

They stopped selling physical newspaper years ago, one stupid enough spend money it. hyper-partisan online-only news source. Basically Breitbart left.

The worst part readers (or currently studying for) degrees consider part intelligentsia; says something pretty bad educational system. sometimes wanna go walk enjoy brief sense normalcy smell crisp autumn air, shitty mask smell. Come on. Allow people get walk get fresh air. Thank you. wondering reference new therapeutics, therapeutics vaccine. Mask usage one group things *has done together* order maximum effectiveness. Masks *plus* distance *plus* ventilation *plus* limited time mean little transmission. *Each piece* **helps** none home run own. 

So mask usage alone ***helps***. However, people using masks properly. Anecdotally, see less 5% people using mask properly, even half mask somewhere them. take sit work. take eat public. leave noses out. pull away face talk. Everything disturbs mask covered mask means mask protecting anyone.

So we're better could without masking all. However, could whole lot better avoid lockdowns people used masks properly coupled interventions reinforce benefits masks. flatten curve

Now ‚Äòwe americans‚Äô. Thank think asthma associated worse outcomes, counter-intuitively. learned something covid UK second lockdown right now.

Multiple lockdowns symptom failed policies. necessary like amputating legs necessary fucking surgery. That's similar sometimes flu. provide two data sets. People tested total tests. People tested counts one positive one negative test result person tested. tested positive. Another positive would never added total. people health care undoubtedly tested negative numerous times. None negative tests count toward daily total. positive test would, though.

They also provide total tests number. presents test results particular day, regardless tested many times.

What look like data?

On 10/16, 3,653 people tested positive 12,326 people tested negative. seven-day average percent positive person 22.1%.

On 10/16, 3,976 positive tests 29,467 negative tests. seven-day percent positive test 11.8%. Actually tested 5 days ago Thursday, developed symptoms Saturday went get tested Sunday. system working still important investigate try identify failed system refined reduce risk. 

For New Zealand reading I'll provide little back story. covid outbreaks quite interesting follow low numbers often allow thorough accurate investigation. example recent transmission traced mutual contact rubbish bin. 

Recently 200 deep sea fishermen flown Russia Ukraine work fishing boats. granted border exemption quite controversial suspect even moreso 31 tested positive covid infection border worker. 
Given working place fishermen staying source seems clear next step genomic sequencing virus confirm chain transmission. 
They also reviewing security footage order try figure infection occured given precautions take. meant ‚Äòmore‚Äô vaccine? tyranny. piece cloth, mate. Surely we're strong enough follow rule prevent reduce transmission.

I would post that. change mind. study worth linking to. 

That said, people get cold (or flu) asymptomatic. large percentage people get COVID asymptomatic, too.

Meanwhile assholes 6th street Austin can't fucking bothered stay home pandemic. Cases 2 weeks skyrocket! Yep daily cases increase +300% came neighboring counties NY OH shot well. Fuck super spreader events. we're actually great came weeks ago. Good thing children congregate school daily go home live separate adults, could lead lot adults getting sick. /s again, according latest science, going happen odd brief accidental encounter outside takes accumulated equivalent 15 mins close contact inside.  mean walking dog empty street need mask on? kid riding scooter sidewalk?

Example: Sturgis motorcycle rally lead 260,000 cases covid-19. Yeah, free. Ignorance law valid defense. No, Mitch Pelosi got way. house passed stimulus bill may, Republican senate never brought vote. Damn. cousin got like month delivered, baby fine. COVID seems randomly destructive... Hard city, mask up. Wtf people downvoting for? 100% uncomfortable. it, I‚Äôm happy wear mask protect others working out, I‚Äôm going lie say I‚Äôm comfy. People lost god damned minds. important things individual rights freedoms responsible, rational person would recognize would happily willingly accept little restriction time severe crisis like America blinded belief exceptionalism simply refuses right thing. Three months lockdown make sure thing contained, tests allowed out, contacts easily traced, one travel meet one spread virus, dies out, problem solved. Three months - nothing grand scheme anyone's lives - America fucking selfish even that. 

""Follow science.""

The virus spreads person person via breath primarily, survive surfaces - vector people. People need fucking isolate means ISOLATE. Extreme minimal contact zero contact beyond household. meet anyone can't pass anything anyone. That's science. change folk worried fucking rights. That's what's needed, folk voluntarily need compelled whatever means necessary.

Three poxy months Americans can't even that. 

It's sick. irrational obsession freedoms rights else biggest, dangerous cult world ever seen. Americans can't trusted right thing circumstances vast, vast majority cases. We're either closet racists who'll happily sell kids' grandkids' future quick buck we're selfish assholes we'll sell entire nation sake individuality. rare-by-comparison stuck middle overwhelmed cultists chaos sides. We're fucked. Frankly entire world would better us dead. neighbor trust. college kid recovered covid thinks everyone get move on. 

I said unsafe unnecessary stand face face talking 15+ minutes day pretty vibrant Halloween neighborhood. aware risk low, definite there. wife knows also justifying ""well, can't walk away neighbor"". wear mask outside walking dogs trails, already routinely step several yards trail encountering others. wear mask outside odd small social occasion, people seated near extended period. agree wear best mask wear, even bad masks good bandanas make difference. know right! Fuming allowed stay open two balls :( think understand point wearing mask. supposed take sneeze... Yeah sure! Luckily I‚Äôve stayed employed feel absolutely terrible suffering...you make valid points. Love compassion. opposed trillions costs associated unemployment due social distancing? Yeah...I'd rather spend billions Ok, thanks. 

I'll note second category currently (""might increased risk"" vs ""has increased risk""). 

But heard even that, stand corrected. Hi Redditors,

What best sources show folks stating that:

* COVID harmless, deaths people would died regardless due poor health terminal diseases 
* Hydroxichloroquine best medecine. Government prescribing sell drug profit
* Shutdowns bad since people go hospital health issues rather staying home thus aggravating disease offsetting lives saved Covid deaths health problems

Thanks, little 1% country like US 100 completely randomly selected people restaurant get it, one dies.

By way, die go hospital suffer horribly. 1 100 dying hospital turns 19 people 100 got needed go hospital 5 need hospitalization.)

And local hospital gets filled up, staff get burned out, keep hoping one 80 gets stay home get chicken soup. probably are, goody you.

So local community compete turmoil, got favorite burger favorite restaurant. suppose that's nice you. True that, let‚Äôs real. People always complained littlest things since test time. everyone please stop hoping damn reopening. It‚Äôs giving everyone hope. Experts said may last 2 years, that‚Äôs get vaccine. Stop giving false hope love country point, plain old corrupt sounds like dream compared reality. experienced sheltering bombs. agree work, talk whatever hell want. simply say masks work think people wear misleading. virus nose accumulates course day. Every little bit exposure adds up. CDC recently revised guidance take account. Never heard Nope. We're going visit family friends. We'll get back dating social lives in-person schooling.

The goal eradication, prevent overwhelmed healthcare system. Wear masks, socially distance wash hands frequently. Don‚Äôt make fun scientists medical professionals, trying save lives. absolutely **outdoors**. absolutely **indoors**. Enforce cases spreading, purposes virtue signaling.

Utah probably better Rave scene states decades.  ban cars? create much risk could forcibly end. adults allowed decide want take risk? I‚Äôm walk like that, go without mask take steps step sidewalk make plenty distance pass anyone. certainly wouldn‚Äôt judge anyone else wearing mask. occasionally see people walk wearing one God - I‚Äôve read study *decades* absolutely blown away TWIV linked mentioned it. think it‚Äôs important get real story misunderstanding significance really widespread. Hes got beat some. 

But think stick around while. Make brass, less likely spread infections people touch it. OAN new FOX True, Holmes, might jumped uncertain conclusion. reallllly option? Seems like , idk, could stay? 

Mostly love first try plead helpful country, admit sneak anyway tell get it. favorite part. issue order put mask FUCKING NOSE? That's social distancing means.  lockdown support opposition non-partisan, increasingly become even wears on. sound like crazy prison. There's actually regions facing beginning Second wave. Cases town jumped 30 cases/Day 200/day last week. still find amazing, even though world wide pandemic..we humans still cannot get shit together actually work one race.

Would really bad, once? 

Hugs afar‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°  would say mediocre. Could sibling, bunch discs. laws pass past stupidest fucking thing I‚Äôve ever heard   Please take germophobic head pull behind think people mental health issues restrictions businesses failing due them. point, virus going problem society. Majority protesters want king constitutional control. probably want abolish institution official demand constitutional monarchy.  easier light says make decision every single intersection whether safe enough run red light.

So true! honestly make us sheep whatever people want call us. Honestly expend mental energy big/important/impactful things, comes problem sitting red light extra 20 seconds. That‚Äôs probably ok country comparatively beaten covid19 I, /s really needs there. Spoiler alert, neither NPIs perfect, gatherings, 70% transmissions happen, certainly still occurring, anything greater frequency ever since start pandemic. Vacations, nightlife, whole host spready activities occurred Europe throughout summer. None surprising unless adamant 20% HIT. mass superspreading event country. /s You‚Äôre right can‚Äôt trusted. kinds people don‚Äôt tend little close though. tend quite blatant following rules. people easy reprimand.

There people trying right thing make mistakes. Knowing difference 5‚Äô 6‚Äô difficult some. Reprimanding isn‚Äôt easy shouldn‚Äôt be. 

I take masks incredibly serious use ‚Äútwo body lengths away‚Äù policy prevent mistakes. however enforce masking rules job states 6‚Äô. Worth mentioning it‚Äôs deep anti mask territory. Follow rules start paperwork. It‚Äôs hard separate offenders folks trying right especially far crisis.

Going time mask requirement ignoring problem. Enforcing rules problem. it‚Äôs hard separate people don‚Äôt give shit people trying. Police overwhelmingly aren‚Äôt enforcing though subscribe anti mask rhetoric. Lack enforcement lack enforcement matter rules state.

There accountability police. don‚Äôt job improperly excused citizens suffer consequence.   count # cases positivity.What's good 12k cases test 50K people.

That's 25% positivity 1 every 4 person tested gives positive result.

Monday's results were: 25K tests 6K cases.Positivity: That's still 25% positivity 1 4 testing positive.

Infections 12k 6k. So, must better, right? Nope. Positivity same. 1 4 still testing positive week. still hold ""not primary vector"" great phrase convince people take unnecessary risks. pass someone public sneeze, late either pull mask.  beginning seen sort of, incl. fancy N95 clones. mostly cheap single layer cotton masks surgical ones. I've even seen nurses wearing off-time home minimize exposure kids. definitely shithole. definitely lot shit ground everywhere. risk dying. risk spreading it. still get possibly irreversible organ damage it, even asymptomatic.  Everything said awful. happened went vacation family. stopped got gas town even far live (a couple hours), ONE wearing mask, got dirty looks wearing one. disturbing. issues BC absolutely contact traces. statement say anything science common sense? may sound like stupid thing ask he‚Äôs pawning science common sense. He‚Äôs shit ton people ignoring science common sense already wearing masks within six feet, stores, etc. see every day place. 

This isn‚Äôt blue decision made... we‚Äôre cases probably 6 7 fold around June/July rapidly approaching worst, hell state. 

Enough people willfully ignoring public safety measures he‚Äôs making mandatory, makes sense me. literally says article - they‚Äôre tired people interpreting rules feel they‚Äôre taking interpretation part - hence ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt nice things‚Äù comment. family marginalized group? Yeah, buy truth. SF better visit, LA live. good bad (easier get away bad LA) management expectations continues.

A certain orange guy overhyped this, dragging entire western world noisy promises magic bullets.  time goes on, grownups going clean overpromised/underdelivered mess.  Even vaccine record time, able much. why, pants course! starts mask, soon we'll cover torso, upper legs, ass feet too! tyranny!  ""The number Americans recorded given citizenship U.S. residency soared 5,816 first six months 2020, compared 2,072 2019, according data Internal Revenue Service. third quarter, numbers dropped dramatically 800, embassies curbed services pandemic.""

Mm no, sorry, can't leave America. leaving America office closed. matter slice it, think way run event like Olympics normally summer 2021. lot countries approaching even normalcy then, bunch foreign nationals come without substantial restrictions could disastrous. Best case scenario run isolated Olympic village setup stadiums filled essentially Japanese much smaller number foreign VIPs. delaying even cancelling would best course action looking economic standpoint. Covid-19 Zoomer active night shift. work. According majority state's reddit, everybody gets things like weddings private gatherings. disease spread gyms, stores, restaurants schools according them. even mention unlikely zero spread indoor places large groups people are, downvoted hell. denial insane. embarrasing makes news. normal countries done. Right live Montana less dense NZ far worse..... people refuse wear masks refuse vaccinated. sure Baker ordering Northern California wear masks? Damn, that's hard hear :( 
Unfortunately, even many shops closing, there's street go daily commute. I've noticed night past would shops open, light everywhere...now eerily dark, quiet boot. There's bookshop open think one cafe 9 shops one stretch, give idea many things closed down. Anyone Corona # China? Sorry, specified. meant civets, people. Well obvious ones though...almost East Asian country would good choice probably stay good choice. people keep going way do, 7 months feel like eternity. People 7 months know better now. Keep mind time felt essential works especially health field, working tirelessly frustration must feel see lack effort people making (this aimed people ignoring way safe going parties, jazz) 

Just way voting makes difference everyone‚Äôs individual efforts keeping virus bay do. 

Please vote wear mask everyone taking risk better though, no?

Issa cloth. big boy. did. Below. Well, silly wear one walking one street 1,000 opioid deaths BC far year 269 covid19 deaths. pushing fearmongering agenda driving people overdose deaths. Step back think bigger picture entire health society. Honest big pharma guy? Knock feather. reason seatbelt mandated 5mph parking lot.

So matters. actual fuck people still wearing masks public?? completely blows mind  Yeah don‚Äôt know that.. someone could probably sneeze/cough third floor apartment building infect someone first floor windows open. likely I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted hell proof mark words. confirm. grew Salt Lake City went many raves 2002 2008, perhaps 50 total. saying Salt Lake County, almost none raves went were. handful went SLC. Many Toole County Saltair, others Utah County, Uinta mountains, one notable one thrown border Nevada. Even threw one once...in Wyoming. need find open space away police lug generators audio/visual equipment.

The people ""running"" scene back likely done something dumb this. Kinda sad hear this.

Edit: 9p-1am rave. 9pm-4am indoor 9pm dawn (or later) outdoor.  judge giving information rather public health official something? curious‚ÄîI think gods work Lol no, politicized point wearing one statement true disciple Trump. loooot people wanna trumpiest dipshit room. provide one, numpty. Burden proof's you.  need see science one. honestly think helmets would hindrance help. would make difficult look around see cars beside/behind could arguably lead accidents thus injuries, less. 

And life balancing risk reward. Like I‚Äôve said comments, risk worth mask (possibly getting someone else sick) worth reward wearing mask (basically nothing. mask doesn‚Äôt bother all. prefer wearing it). Anyone disagrees either underestimating virus cares slightly decreased comfort health lives others that‚Äôs really shitty way be. Lockdowns cannot solve core problem, yes.

Right lockdowns really desperate attempts stop rolling snowball causing avalanche.

Stuffy rooms full viral aerosols autumn winter help. John Oliver segment Trump's handling coronavirus Sunday. There's part clips people. 

Absolutely wild.

Every someone around. Much easier put walking outside front door, ""vigilant"" I'm going stroll, enjoy zoning thinking random shit walk.

Also like think I'm helping small way since people see wearing mask, thus encouraged same. Without feeling weird. weird, reasonable. See - guy it. he's fit 30 year man. Etc forth.

And that's big data AI basically improve everyone's lives. need enourmous samples artificial neural networks. gone rails extremists sides. Real life ain't Plague Inc. dude. couldn‚Äôt see full comment first willing respectfully disagree. read 

It‚Äôs people like make millions others say we‚Äôre wearing masks fuck lockdowns. piss condescending assholes like think know best everyone enforce benevolent (albeit temporarily) totalitarian governments

It‚Äôs Black Death. Calm states need scaling back - even - NOW.

Look straight trajectory Europe: anyone doesn‚Äôt believe US line straight distant future, please pass you‚Äôre drinking smoking. I‚Äôd also like escape reality awhile, too. Give break, hes shining example American education system, summer north large % cant see 2 feet front door. shut face-hole ignorant moron.

[In united 9.5 million confirmed covid cases 235 thousand deaths. **That's 2.5% mortality rate**.

[In united one million confirmed covid cases 47 thousand deaths. **That's 4.5% mortality rate**. also live Melbourne lots 'significants' coming line... live bc ppl basically back normal, olden times... except masks. little social distancing really regard keeping contacts low. restaurants pubs pretty busy, downtown basically business usual. covid prob decent appetizer rn Throw Ye's whacked ass question what's solution say 30-45% US gets vaccine since that's conversation originally about. obviously want taxpayers pay lifelong disabilities (even though number things higher frequency). what's solution? said taking risk better. seems factors play risk.  crazy allergic ragweed leaf mold. yard work August December wearing respirator minimize exposure. me, mandatory masks awesome! excuse looking weird.

I wish easier find masks work purposes. Good pollen/mold masks vents exhalation; they're keeping stuff out. Good COVID-19 masks want trap exhaled droplets; they're good keeping stuff in.

Vogmask good paper, seal well respirator. worn together outside working around people, 2-3 hours I'm spent. lot things probably become clearer get better figures excess deaths Brazil. AFAIK, seem anywhere near high Peru per capita terms.

Brazil's IFR may turn lower developed countries, btw. population quite bit younger (and therefore less vulnerable) Europe US. Literally first three words post ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt live there‚Äù, saying wouldn‚Äôt listen think law oppressive even though I‚Äôm pro-mask wrong? done that? guess u don‚Äôt live Arizona? hahahahaha produce claim produce products prevent disease, illness, spread viruses.

That's page linked to. consistently communicated BUFF¬Æ Multifunctional Headwear designed, clinically tested prevent transmission diseases viruses

That's Covid-19 statement site. mean, one really around. one's going see wearing mask. ""Should ban something clear benefit comes small risk."" significant downside wearing mask, even outside. Argue good faith. Lol disease literally 99.9% survival rate. science end says cause imprisoning 5 million 4 months. Fuck social media. guy born 2000s, conclusively say 90s better videos saw. mean 2pac Biggie half decade. chin diapers, work? lol, appreciate optimism live Arizona hahahaha üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Science say two friends wearing masks running may stop chat while. familiarity friends means neither may think put masks on.

This rule stops that. also stops people able argue police mask on.

It's piece cloth front face. hard  everyone who's yelling government needs pay everyone's bills next X years, earth proposing money come from? void? Go troll somewhere else. Dissenting views =/= brigaded. 3x many 14 year window flu deaths. means covid 42x deadly flu average single flu year. That‚Äôs line seeing cities.....so, no, it‚Äôs flu solution ‚Äúwe need learn live it‚Äù. Enjoy nanny state think rational person would approve Dr. Fauci.   #PANIK live Melbourne. I'm saying approach imprisons everone easy Australia cuz southern hemisphere. example circumstances different. Thank you. 

I advocated lot beginning pandemic training additional nurses critical care. problem always management PPE. 

Management looking cut spending. pay additional costs train staff higher level specialty. top that, management blew aneurysms amount resources needed single covid patient. never meant sustainable way running hospital, especially profit system.

The issue PPE. don‚Äôt know hospital system area supplied enough go back best practice usage. Training means double PPE single shift. Hell, didn‚Äôt even get PAPR entire time covid ICU. Management even balls tell send hood using working covid ICU elective surgery morning, surgical patient covid. asked.

TLDR - tried train CCRNs mismanagement resources pandemic administration gotten hospitals are. think wearing mask pacifies you, I'd like recommend good therapist. Yup. Passing someone 2 seconds little nothing compared grocery store 30 minutes. live democracy bases policy decisions science. Flattening curve never goal returning normal. goal overwhelm Healthcare keep lives close normal possible (aka locked down, yah know... dead.) it‚Äôs dozens feet away, yeah there‚Äôs science behind that. cough heavy breathing (jogging) travel much cold, dry air.

Really though, make easier spot folks non-compliant; folks charge enforcement. care enforce. 

Gets rid excuses extreme cases imparement.  Correct, sit infected person indoors. Outdoors risk infinitesimally low thanks perfect ventilation. mUh fRieDums history buddy?? False equivalence. Funny governments across world seem failing miserably ""one simple trick"" trying stop millions people moving around city whilst community transmission present. quit day job. simple suggest. Projecting. think necessary/unnecessary risk distinction worthwhile logic going outside unnecessary risk. question ""what meaningful risk transmission"" shape standards around that.

I would rather 95 percent compliance 75 percent effective rule 75 percent compliance 100 percent effective rule. kills 0.1% controlled virus dumb-ass. united states example, 9.5 million confirmed covid cases 235 thousand deaths. **That's 2.5% mortality rate**.

How concentrate controlling plague shithole think give us advice. I'll enjoying summer peace people coughing death. live New Jersey experienced second lockdown like much Europe cases spiking like Europe. I'm sure enjoy Christmas. We're talking acts god here, putting thing face actually get control.  kind bullshit. Half dentistry doesn‚Äôt really count think healthcare. sucks dentistry pretty high risk is.  hospitals, states shit order elective surgeries. state halted, need get governor authorities enforce mask mandates stopping group gatherings. Otherwise, don‚Äôt know say. We‚Äôre seeing hospitals getting overrun multiple cities it‚Äôs going get worse next month. Time population part. statement makes obvious masks pointless pushed scare literally pacify population. go skiing wear mask anyway..... covid.. AMA AstraZeneca folks month ago, asked thought vaccine would induce robust immune response old people confer immunity.

The response basically *we hope so.* big, fat elephant room whole vaccine debate, almost one know damn thing it.

Basically vaccine work, need functioning immune system recognize introduced antigens generate neutralizing antibodies them. Problem is, COVID really tends kill people lack functioning immune systems, even effective vaccine developed, likely protect people need most. I'll never understand masks became matter identity politics. use one silicone cage face things go underneath mask. makes considerable difference running. type comment indicative general lack critical thinking goes along people‚Äôs response virus. type thinking wasted energy. opportunity cost this. applied pointed effort towards things actually matter stopping spread rather try overwhelmingly exhaust people restrictions, you‚Äôd much effective overall response. Oh neat, toddlers charge keeping virus around. people actually follow mask laws MA? I'm SoCal ""simplification"" would impact anyone public ignores law officials available willing enforce anyway. outside Nevada sure doesn't. Nothing accumulates nose aside morning nosebleeds. dry fuck here.

But virus still spreading. live? task force city I'd put mask outdoors see cop, wear one outdoors otherwise.  get sister get 'rona? Stop trying control wife ffs. about, ""Sorry eat help out"" plan lock sooner plan second time row? Well one coming give ticket. 1.5t Problem Solvers Caucus? 1.9T WH stimulus package Pelosi Mnuchin working on? Nancy Pelosi nothing approach wanted everything highway.  Condo market already tanking...so rents well. Still probably months hits rock bottom I‚Äôm say going make people upset. I‚Äôm El Paso ever since shooting everyone thinks nothing hurt them. It‚Äôs annoying mindset. Ever since corona thing started NOBODY stayed home like we‚Äôre supposed to. Everybody wants go see Abuela not. need lockdown. need heavily enforced. I‚Äôm talking $10,000 fine someone they‚Äôre supposed be.There literally way city morons buffoons gonna stay home without someone made example. El Pasoan, generally everybody else ask this. Would rather see Family couple months they‚Äôre healthy couple weeks casket. Stay home,wear mask,wash hands, *maybe* *MAYBE* consider you‚Äôre person world you‚Äôre main character. You‚Äôre extra. Hmm, feel like isn‚Äôt time obfuscation vaguery read scientist - seemingly credible one - say ‚Äòthe majority of‚Äô think it‚Äôs classic humble scientist phrasing basically means ‚Äòeveryone except outliers‚Äô - 95 - 99%. think figure like 55% different phrasing would used. 

We hope. ""Hey everybody alzheimer's ward! Remember take meds try die... nurses gotta stay home quarantine weeks. way keep safe""  That's two Northeast (see Phil Scott) cool sitting waiting 24 hours broken leg, floor beds available, dad heart attack easily could survived, dies due lack resources, cool, let's ""live it"". definitely stop wearing seatbelt. Important thing understand germ theory wear masks germs spread around, virtue signaling self protection. That's actually pretty lucky situation. Add ventilation fan facing near ceiling really good shape. excuse assholes, course, take wins cam get them.  feel way. live small town walk dog trails see almost one. see someone coming, put mask on. see point wearing mask there's one sight. right there. getting fixed, going over. What's bad renters working, never work, paying. There's one thing landlord county either. dont mind part. single house used live in, rented "" friend"". Someone worked 20 years. unemployment went paying mortgage. gave 500.00 month credit three months.i figure year rent time finally get court. hand delivered forms them, sent county info, name it. parties get together. sad someone shafts you, can. Bye. might true greatest country earth. seems majority lives paycheck paycheck. Europe, people mildly put retarded. Schools provide masks.  Replace Covid-19 PS-5 we‚Äôre praising parents...smh. /s makes perfect sense lol. would trust current office handle things well competently? going take time clean current mess staff unqualified people positions power.

Sad 2020, trust big pharm government... fucked timeline in. totally depends tho. NYC know people don‚Äôt give af. you, one judging. Let's real though, WI running bars restaurants droves they've decided sacrifice health order financially support small businesses. denial selfishness drives we're seeing. short term behavior giving small businesses money, long term prolonging suffering everyone including businesses. 

Personally, think everyone paid stay home small businesses able apply assistance get started spread control. can't like last time relief package small businesses went trump's friends family bunch huge corporations.  mandate wear mask everywhere bring everywhere. Non-sequitur Lmao, dude need take long look yourself. I'm sure Korean masks kept safe, fact doctor knows viruses work. enforceable. People aren‚Äôt going outside. thought too.. even doctors careless.. No. Shit. Sherlock. Yes.

Just stop pedantic, crybaby nitpicking; responsible adult. everyone wore mask, even seem necessary, thing would well control now. 

Think like seatbelt car empty road.. still put damn thing hardly inconvenient smart/safe thing do. Holy shit Nope White House event Rose Garden later moved indoors infections happened. 

Contact tracing proven cases arise people casually passing street. thought rampant racism worst thing Boston new strain Spain obviously MUCH infectious. Exactly. Look well Japan far. Why? entire population wearing masks almost 80 something years now. Yeah, called quarantining. can't healthy city vibrant life city pandemic. situation *hugely* (albeit slowly) improved Brazil last months.

Sao Paulo epicentre beginning (unsurprising: biggest city Western hemisphere lot travel Italy). Deaths nearly 80% lower peak (source: \- click ""municipio"" search it, whatever city want).

It's hard tell whether due seasonal changes herd immunity. heard anything new lockdowns put place recently. know. little while. go back forth.

There's constant battle going life ""this thing serious, play games"" ""you're silly, chance infected way like zero."" 

Do sterilize packages come even though reported cases people getting sick way? wear mask there's nobody within 100 feet directions? safe get take-out worried putting something mouth prepared someone else MIGHT sick?

It's wanted wear mask want wear mask. anxiety make decision. Making decisions mentally taxing. thing. studied.

Now, someone made decision me. That's one less thing decide. curfew. amount people less time?  That‚Äôs wife said, keep track occupancy, aren‚Äôt either things, there‚Äôs really legitimate reason. frustrating. headline misleading. relatively limited resources, many things Covid19 pandemic related. major role coordinating national NGO efforts.

They're still invaluable efforts like smallpox polio eradication, connecting donors everything AIDS cocktails mosquito netting electrolyte solutions (for infants dysentery) national health services. abandon US role one WHOs member countries funders represents utter height willful ignorance current US administration. Goodbye logic common sense. wear mask alone?  
This means breathing dirty bacteria instead fresh clean air. got robbed. split Covid-19 relief across every tax payer cost us $18,000, got measly $1,200 back. Republicans robbed us pay donors. I'm walking dog street small town there's literally one else sight?  Im glad ancestors fled country Depends got business required operate restriction laws. Tables separated, limit occupancy, stuff.Because there's laws stop people walking past dining areas, walking past eachother street. will. Millions times often going eat.

The point trying get people wear damn things instead using semantics figure don't.

As someone lives place finished similar lockdowns, they'll escalate include stuff they're taking seriously. 


Masks times literally last thing go, be. Mass. already one highest country mask compliance. point mask mandates diminishing returns. spread happening private, indoor dining, schools. state really much fronts. wish survival rate high teachers, school staff, parents, grandparents watch school, high risk friends... Ha! right, comment forgot watch mods second used name political parties US, though said truth, still deleted! 


What fucking joke. :) say says Muse concert utah lmao. I've dozens concerts slc pleeenty drinking... say least. often shit underwear public? don‚Äôt want vaccine, don‚Äôt it. people don‚Äôt change lives them. Produce stats then. guarantee you‚Äôre misinterpreting  lot countries situation, hopefully since across board net impact countries stay relative everyone else. kept hearing sort supplement $400 week people supposed get, something like that. know was? unemployment aid referencing? There's social price paid that. many places, people look askance they're 50 yards deserted street mask up.

I think worth worrying whether rational appropriate behavior. People affected weird social stuff good policy works framework. Baker quintessential RINO. one reasons Warren stans overly worried vacating seat position Biden administration. He's denounced party. I‚Äôm sorry live Massachusetts. afford move, states available walk dog let 5 year old ride scooter. 

MA joke. Yeah else take charge? Let Pompeo ""investigation"" plant evidence?

Maybe back world would freaked out, lately China demonstrated controlled pandemic well numbers made-up. kid keeps mask on. three. current government competent enough, saw corruption malfeasance masks ventilators. mention threat revenge certain states political basis. April Sweden 18th highest deaths/population list 218. That's terrible. /r/COVID19Positive. clueless douche bag ordered masks Korea kept covid-free far. Three people department 13 caught ""have idea got it"". 

However, still right. I'll go apologize thank reminder. someone ELI5 PCR cycle threshold I'm seeing anti-maskers constantly bring sudden? peddle lot lies scientific misunderstanding want understand another case that. Vaccine expected 50-70% effective, effective mask. 

So vaccinate everyone US, might get numbers today, means hospitals overwhelmed hotspots, everywhere threatening become hotspot.

So pair vaccine masks distancing get numbers down. 

If masks plus distance 3 months plus mandatory vaccine plus long term international travel ban could probably clear virus totally. Americans probably stubborn that. seems mention phase 3 vaccines similar amounts vaccine well. seems even unrealistic. Ahah. Good old censorship trying bring light situation debate politics. still important investigate try identify failed system refined reduce risk. 

Fully agree, aim prevent infections needs investigated. second aim went infection occur, caught early possible. 100% airtight border impossible good see checks working should. Bring mask everywhere =/= wear mask everywhere Link? meant people Canada, got it. certainly felt bad people got sick never worried health. people didn't. arguing months.

People taking advantage exceptions months.

This needs everywhere. outside home people household home (sometimes necessary ie plumber) need wear mask covers mouth nose.

That‚Äôs it. supposed disappear Easter like miracle go away Spring warms up.

/$ Sceince say mask useful one else around outside. interesting see people react finished lockdown looked much same, way tighter. 
It's getting everybody stop circulating much, especially others homes. can't home restrictions movement. 


I hear there's work home mandate though?  Honestly, wear mask regardless, absurd require masks outside, still allow indoor dining.  happens civilized countries: get back normal life control virus. win right Get P100 respirator, would actually effective filtering small particles kicked unlike cloth would look less place landscaping equipment. necessarily. example January planned trip September without possibility get money back. went trip everything could protect others. Please name one time ""slippery slope"" ever actually happened led horrible events  even wear masks restaurant booth COVID immunity zones? Yea. Tiny like fine print shady contract dumb-asses too. seem less you.

I mean seriously dude. one unintelligent people I've seen around parts, that's saying something. supposed know Charlie Baker is? learned people like lockdowns that's probably it. making 6 figures Europe... true popular vote count poor kids... Look first reply you.

The point bullshit everyone go covid deadly. avoid overcrowding hospitals country, rendering actually serious, non-covid-related medical issues unable receive medical attention.

Reading comprehension difficult, know. first reply you. hard understand could prefer wearing it, find uncomfortable. still wear times inside public outside within 25 feet people, happy take godforsaken things soon can. 

Baker's mandate might make sense Boston, insanity require people wear law hiking woods biking deserted rural street Berkshire County. Netherlands, 8000 positive (an well 10% positive rate amongst tested) happened estimate 160.000 infectious carriers. actually think people follow new rule. Like lmaoooo ok realize dumb-ass, realize get winter southern hemisphere northern hemisphere gets summer? know? Cuz tilt axis earth?

You think flu seasons aligned winter months? Yeah won‚Äôt wearing one there‚Äôs Covid vaccine, wearing mask regular flu season like it‚Äôs normalized Asian countries. It‚Äôs going 70+ next week said impose fines??? LaserDisc  Cry river :( mask bad:( even tend put don‚Äôt forget, i‚Äôm contaminating mask taking gop machine recruiting unlikely voters loads - read it. data mining anyone vote before. educated people typically vote people outside that. pollsters factor votes fringe ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ flu season different hemisphere. thought obvious. Genuine question someone runs town frequently supposed wearing mask running? try best run past people, sometimes bridges narrow paths options.. took governments people accepting science instead listening dumb-asses like you. Yeah, piece conflicting. Vote. Serology studies put NYC ~20% infection rate, that's ~10x higher case counts, NYC undercounting 10x...

Official NYC case counts: NYC positivity rates 20%-40% range Spring, that's also sign massive undercounting, remember numbers watched them, good place point to) governor, would mask policy be? Spiral staircase going joking. Russia one countries high level biodefense programs; anything trust vaccine ""private business"" mention (see gilead ) im SF live LA, SF really run im hating truth. LA run areas, run many places, thats ok. Wow circus came early year business's policy government mandate.... Great response. know lot anti-maskers due slew still wear masks ""risky"" places like restaurants, grocery stores, etc. kind mandates affraid of. point I'm worried right encouraged wear masks public 10 years prevent flu ripple effects like that. one way signs do?

Not criticizing, genuinely curious Today saw something terrified me; American president rallied crowd chant ""Fire Fauci"" gave promise it.

I can't wait stupid election country finally realize pandemic exists election conspiracy rest world came you. Maybe finally get dealing properly Covid-19 virus agree more. would wear rural area? Per Baker's mandate law. talking about? take scientist lock city that's point. uh yes, SF city suck, tourist centric city, pretty much tourist spots nice... Oh, yeah one's really going enforce policy fever present employee work. Also, monitoring temperature repeatedly time (was actually curious temperature circadian rhythm) actually get mild fevers time time reason, probably random inflammation case hormonal shifts associated cycle (female here) course eventually return normal. take people long adapt changes, people easily able adapt back things used be. deaths beginning Post original point thread Australia ready rest world not

We took action. didn't. consequence lack action: 246,000 covid infections 16,000 deaths. **That's 6.5% mortality Look stats rn much better rest world .

New Jersey literally highest covid death rate united states. 0.2% total population died infection. live SF lots liberals big house parties too. fuck anything? coworkers coming around, company made masks mandatory, still 50/50 little wear them.

I'm guessing supervisors afraid confront them, write up. never choice health economy. choice neither. west choose neither paying price.

You choose ""both"" eliminating virus economy thrive.

The places chose amazingly well - China, NZ, Australia. Historians look back 2020 year China took world leadership away US, US spend years faltering China thrives. pretty terrifying aggressively submissive revealed people be. used annoy too. Especially I‚Äôm walking two dogs it‚Äôs hard get way don‚Äôt bother putting enough distance us. I‚Äôll wear mask I‚Äôm walking dogs together people often come ask it‚Äôs hard get mask time someone gets face. I‚Äôm seeing people wearing masks outside, especially joggers nice. It‚Äôs easier taking need (and I‚Äôll often run store get milk). It‚Äôs also keeping fave warm (not fan breath though). find worst offenders getting space maskless entire families rounds kids strollers. I‚Äôll normally try get way though anyway neither dogs fans little buggers close up. Wow careful, bigotry showing! want we? don‚Äôt care. mask ez street wear. I‚Äôm gonna never take mine off. I‚Äôll sleep on. want decrease chances getting covid much possible. Wearing mask isn‚Äôt big deal all. Take logic get here! deaths beginning pandemic. Post original point thread Australia ready rest world not. Look stats rn much better rest world . Ok, often passes along way, doesn‚Äôt long exposure neither wearing mask, frequently spread short exposure. He's Republican pretending Democrat, still Republican. support ranked choice voting, endorsed Susan Collins, never said anything sort friend. argument yourself.

I said COVID's survival rate high, is. Money printer goes brrrrrrrr hemisphere got it? instincts tell body needed ultrapotent reactions, would own. makes zero sense anybody rural area US: prevalence obesity 18.5% affected 13.7 million children adolescents. Obesity prevalence 13.9% among 2- 5-year-olds, 18.4% among 6- 11-year-olds, 20.6% among 12- 19-year-olds. - **roughly 1 5 children**. agree ""the main group children"" imo exception. smaller group ok example 15.9 18.9 million (natural) blonde Americans exist (2010). Given total 310 million Americans (2010), estimate percentage, blondes 5.1% 6.0%. blonde american exception you? would say minimum less 5% call something exception thats opinion. applaud new effort, Baker consistently shown Republican. happy vote election Oh there's surprise, know fk talking Melbourne.  Poor charities. going pay employees line pockets. Enforced what? Fines? Arrests? weird disgusting comment. ""I'm glad forced things making decisions gives anxiety."" trust Americans live work China. one saying lockdowns corpses street China. come floppy discs CD-R? Remember days would get downvoted mentioning shit things going Florida. 

I remember.  [You mean New 246,000 covid infections 16,000 deaths. **That's 6.5% mortality rate.**

And face winter. stop corona tomorrow sub along thank god. Ooooh, he's swearing. means business!!! understanding looks like health workers getting late year, goal attempt vaccinate high risk front line workers Q1 give rest people vaccine Q2 see new law like artificially low speed limit freeway, say make speed limit 55 design really meant 65 mph speed limit don‚Äôt start ticketing till you‚Äôre well 70. words, hopefully cops won‚Äôt get power hungry ticketing empty trails streets, easily handing tickets maskless densely crowded area anywhere indoors. again, it‚Äôs moot point you‚Äôre still allowing indoor dining. LIAR!


it 72 hrs sometimes! ;) earth get two year old keep mask on... mine intermittently battle. 6 months (and nearly 3) finally going full shopping trip on. theres covid people outdoors saying think read here, people saying 20% infections magical number causes herd immunity. kept citing non-peer-reviewed preprints, former doctor twitter claimed another 50% natural immunity. supposed come from: exposure SARS 1 (which infected 10,000 people, mind you!) -- common cold's coronaviruses (unrelated Covid, way herd immunity common cold). far worse that,

1. others pointed out, first deny care 90-year olds, 80-year olds, 70 year olds, ....

2. strongly doubt hospitals operate full capacity longer days/weeks: STAFFED full capacity.. Especially whole country affected..

3. health-care workers keep getting sick capacity actually starts dropping...

4. strongly doubt hospitals tightly separate Covid/Non-Covid patients Covid patients reaches certain threshold.... means might stop serving non-covid patients altogether...

Ultimately, people beds, ""extra"" people get hospital care.. stereotype Americans big egotistical assholes superiority complex actually turned completely true. Nah  tax bases similar? know live Nunavut? Canada rural areas? Per capita per capita, long reasonable number ie deaths per 100k whatever. Australia too.

Thailand done well want claim island look Philippines still battling keep going lockdown.

I know lot people early days went China Thailand 2 weeks Australia get around Australia's travel restrictions China. complicated rules, harder police. make 'if outside house, wear mask', nobody argue what's inside what's outside, etc. mention, there's extra risk infection time adjust mask, telling people keep makes sense medical perspective. I'm army, supposed big exercise week, essentially cancelled covid. training last week, packed room, whenever somebody would talk, they'd pull mask off, talk, put back on. Made absolutely sense think people realize purpose mask. ‚ÄúCan‚Äù

Being bubble solution. ‚Äúcan‚Äù get wearing mask too. ‚Äúcan‚Äù give wearing mask. ‚ÄúCan‚Äù basis decisions policies legal weight. end day national polls spot 2016 clinton popular vote. it‚Äôs electoral college f‚Äôed polls

this year could unlikely voters republicans recruiting could game changer. truth signing loads new voters. don‚Äôt fooled polls abandoned poor walking paths?! developed country world.  ridiculous, simple. made rule exceptions people going read say exception. want mandate masks three year olds? force people keep home? know far realistic right?  two weeks though. Yeah one graph shows masks lower rates anything shows increases. mean yeah that's cool, bad idea sidewalks. doubt they'd enforce parks suburbs. definitely think described reasonable, cut dry nature order makes easier enforce Happened 2004 Kerry VP 2010. wouldn‚Äôt able pass law saying Governor appoint senator party senator left? Tons states law lmao. am, note seeing rampant school tranmissions. two school 6 5 kids respectively transfer virus school. rest school exposures child pre-symptomatic school passing on.  measure implemented far seem working. 2m desks, mandatory masks kids grade 4 above. pretty key symptom kind psychopathy Trump exhibits. best everything, making incapable delegating somehow better grip something him, instead upstage person manufacture conflict so. main strategy try sell reelection bid strength economy, means trying hide reality pandemic drum signs economic growth, happens provide pretext conflict.  kind behavior want see anyone position power - fundamentally, always boils purely selfish motivations. 

Ironically, main systemic dysfunction Soviet Russia Maoist China. Everything would boil competing narratives drummed support political aims. real difference power U.S. purely exercised state apparatus. Again, definition rave starkly different mine mean idea sounds incredibly lame creepy. would nice, suffering meantime?  really internet argument thing, know catch covid19 kill result mild significant health medical issues? uncomfortable, IMO. Happy wear one indoors near people outside I'm going wear one middle woods, that's fucking ridiculous. I'm sliding slippery slope choosing guidelines follow....

Baker mandated masks must worn within 25 feet people outdoors. Solves problem people taking generous interpretation ""6 feet away"" also maintaining reasonable standard residents Commonwealth, Boston. reason avoid herd immunity then. Imagine indoctrinated enough believe shit. free, brainwashed little drone. Seems one aspect many overlook people wearing masks businesses public, home friends family. Got link reputable study backs up? following gut? body sometimes incapable tolerating wheat, lactose nuts.  body well everyone elses sometimes needs mod. makes sense actually, since it‚Äôs usually spread people know makes sense find multiple cases group (especially since one tests positive, others get tested) China didn‚Äôt even know existed got Europe. far know cases present Spain Italy far back September-October 2019. didn‚Äôt spread much winter.

They ban god damned wet markets though. Harping again? kid stuck early 2020? He'll fire Fauci everything sabotage America responding covid loses. petulant child.  canada, schools cases pop up, city 800 000 people, two schools inschool transmissions far 2 months. standard 2meters desks kids wearing mask grade 4 seemed work fairly well far.. Personal care homes community transmission control moving restrictions. Obviously shut down. understand, none states mask mandates lower death rates, point besides ruining quality life? breathing problem masks make day difficult. 
Masking entire population something 9 deaths today seems like overreaction. someone risk paranoid wear mask. care quality life sacrifice mental physical health someone's anxiety breathing 20 ft away them? think there‚Äôs real value consistency. might help establish culture mask wearing like exists many Asian countries everyone gets head wear mask time leave house. sew. I‚Äôve made lot masks quite different shapes, sizes, materials. found comfortable combination made bunch. always clean, comfortable, effective mask. I‚Äôve making giving away many since Fauci first recommending them. 

So physically it‚Äôs uncomfortable all. don‚Äôt trouble breathing frequently drive home walk inside forgetting haven‚Äôt taken off. mentally, I‚Äôm public place anywhere people could makes feel safer. realize that‚Äôs point does. also prevents touching face worrying whether touched wasn‚Äôt thinking it. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs insanity ask people little while. It‚Äôs really much ask. honestly, think they‚Äôre going hiding cameras woods catch people arrest wearing masks? No. It‚Äôs basically honor system. way anyone going know care you‚Äôre wearing mask see you. there‚Äôs really one around think going happen?  mandate still unnecessary. applies urban parks run people several times walk, also middle woods Berkshires see soul. selfish pricks would run within 6 feet still going give fuck. Federal government took swift action based information time lock serverly restrict spread virus shared information public would much better place. President outright lied population bad, cases would fall zero control it, already control knew it.  day, fine people socially distancing wearing masks. watching fox news different perspective biden's gatherings cars, well apart form people wearing mask. stood stark contrast Trumps rally, hardly anyone wearing mask people standing side side touching other.. really incredible majority world actively things stop spread large country fucking repeatedly. Something something Illuminati. Something something New world order. 

Probably /s r/masks4all That's feel masks. can't bothered wear one unsafe stuff get to? can't care people around tells kind person are. cost life Weird hear non-elective surgeries whole floors shut down, hospitals still compete workers. I'm guessing resources train current employees. dumb-asses needed fear punished. rest us knew science. Can't said hydroxy chloroquine? work 11 hour shifts warehouse moving hundreds freight hand involves full squats holding boxes walking upwards 20k steps day. 

Sometimes sucks, sure, sweatier remember breathe mouth, neither impossible big deal.  like 0.02% chance dying younger people list already place. Lockdown vaccine way go. Suspending Schengen, travel visas putting travelers managed isolation even negative tests would good well. *every poll finds

But kidding, everyone lives reality, one would make sense. Yes made rule makes sense: 100% mask usage indoors, mandatory masks outdoors. Simple makes people trust you. understand? comments story cancer. course. right situation, President empowers people like Fauci times like these. President supposed say, ""I'm boss, say listen him. We're dealing something unprecedented, everyone charge economic policy, public health policy, etc. check team finalize anything, checks me."" bad republican. can‚Äôt, they‚Äôve got kids feed, like every ‚Äúessential‚Äù worker government forgot first round stimulus dried up. hate people *jog* past flabby self. dare make admire trim, sweaty physiques. /s don‚Äôt see anybody around I‚Äôm wearing mask   ever seen #walkaway movement. leads believe polls might little skewed.

I always said pollster asked I‚Äôm voting would give wrong answer. hate polls rarely time sit talk random stranger. Great idea hope works!  gotta wear mask outside, walk person 5 seconds literally kill them! Thank guys this! OMG! Like, can't wait family die go world's lamest rave!!! #covidthanksyou Yeah, often Angelenos get celebrate Dodgers Lakers winning championships one year? dont know enough UK politic gauge intent/ineptitude, pandemic really seen/dealt parts world affected sars mers 100 years.. learning fly part. appears trying balance economic well populations health. appears measures took failed enough going back lockdown protect people dying. 

SO.. hindsight, choices made time wrong, believe evil intent harm people. Looking USA think could say thing. really NPC meme come life ridiculous thing say. Extremely disturbing well. Shocking see people defending mandate, even though makes illegal stand middle woods Western Massachusetts without mask on.  US military probably best logistics company world amount times would occur insignificant, sneezer could turn head knew would happen indoors someone 8 months? grocery store, gas station, work? mean, doubt it. kinda amazing me. go work everyday surrounded hundreds students. Nothing it. Fauci mayor universe! socialism? Yes I'm unintelligent I'm going work tomorrow possibly get virus literally kill me. I'll wear mask I'll stay away older vulnerable populations. sure streets clear? feces needles? Well, wearing mask, nobody recognise anyway. People already giving public health measures. people need get reality check What's hard leaving on? get see aftermath... road rash nightmare inducing.

My ex killed motorbike accident 23 years old. fucked us least protective gear. Yes died anyway, least witnesses end ptsd body protected leathers.

My partner biker kids, adamant wearing leathers least jeans law anything 125cc. helmet jack shit come bike 50mph got nothing shorts wife beater tarmac. exactly happened 102 years ago create mask Court handle massive amount fines levied. I'd imagine would good revenue generator struggling municipalities. Portugal Taiwan. Taiwan better option IMO although great. doing, doing, El Paso? due weather. due compliance issues. Except Baker's order applies entire state including rural areas walk street hour see anybody hurt anyone wear mask, what's problem? Dead pandas. misread charles barkley. like reality more. trump. lot black conspiracy theorists believe either, bizarrely sadly. colleague, fellow *teacher*, used regard highly, thinks hoax. students, black, feel same. utterly baffling. one linked article proof, dude. means, end, parroting false rhetoric uneducated pig-beast. know large scale testing done? Batch testing? 

Also, testing stations set up? charge them?

Will / follow cases, like contact tracing etc? 

What quarantine / isolation protocols like? enforcement done?

Tia 30 seconds, late night, know clearly go? car sight? point much conscious decision sit waste time go. feared severely punished.  may possibly get hit bus tomorrow actual fuck people getting banned spreading blatant lies? Based US salary alone, probably. actually work nurse probably make sense, guess. joke week late. grave likes one ever seen. may say greatest grave all. Well, we're brutally honest, reason masks effective lower viral qty people get microdosed instead lethal dosed, keeps dying still make asymptomatic carrier. Dual layered masks shown multiple studies reduce 70-90% particle exposure wearer, recent one personally saw Japan. words, virus vanish America trump wins.

Yeah, USA civil war then. Coronavirus, despite sub, problem world, existential threat human race, unlike constant growth surveillance state police apparatus is.

I pretty sure global warming going even worse. virus worse originally thought everything recommended far enough?

Seems suggested day one. They're fine raised sociopaths. Sucks you. Convenient lol hear this. could fishing, alone, boat. must wear mask.

No medical justification this. are. understand what's going Belgium.

Today's cases around 6500 1/4th 4 days ago 1/2th last Tuesday.

If values real Belgium get COVID control next week.

Why huge decrease taking place? real?

Any idea? even know talking America dug comments. Oh, weather gets cold outside. recirculated air, indoor gatherings holidays, ...

we seen anything yet. know talking American. US one 2 countries declare taxes legally residing abroad. Many countries tax agreements mean earning approximately $100k year pay income tax US, forget investing abroad unless want deal excessively complicated tax obligations. Even $10k savings means file special forms, foreign banks required give IRS annual updates American customers accounts. Technically, no. Read exceptions order. Clearly states doesn‚Äôt apply you‚Äôre alone members household. real story UK government extended furlough scheme final day already existing subsidies. late lot companies way knowing scheme going extended lot people needlessly made redundant.

Not that, quote regular Boris bluster. advised 5 weeks ago lockdown circuit breaker refused. opposition leader said time UK locking Boris ridiculed him. Scottish leader said Tier 3 restrictions country enough Tier 5 needed, ridiculed Boris. petty conservative MPs briefed call current lockdown particular Tier lest give ground Scottish government, call circuit breaker ensure give ground opposition. absolutely ridiculous. flu already significant strain healthcare systems places. Adding another disease similar likelihood severe illness go well. Comes added bonus PRC citizenship within 10 years, survive. isn‚Äôt done country? serious? would love that. would think anyone declare English teacher merely speak language. provide curriculum? person needs able explain language, speak it. Yeah wondering meant religious values. people think virus suddenly vanish Dec 31 2020? That's next month.

 Year end? *pffffftt*

smfh... even bullets. people that. Last time checked virus kinda existed. lockdowns came people. Dumb Americans enough testing capacity? not, asymptomatics first list stop testing.

Overall, testing much anyway disease prevelant. Basically better everyone quarantine point, get R0 low possible. People completely refrain socialization. different ways, not, one main reasons cases exploding western countries. would American give citizenship? I'm Singaporean, we're allowed dual citizenships, makes sense need give Singaporean migrate. US allows dual citizenships, would give up? never said it‚Äôs useless. said it‚Äôs magic bullet own. It‚Äôs quite useful won‚Äôt rid Germany anywhere else virus own. Oh, what, infected people supposed ""super careful?""

Crock shit. people detect? Useless? Come on, think through! thank god government decided stop testing asymptomatic people. Numbers stop climbing stop testing. 
If can't beat virus intelligence, maybe beat stupidity... Well...yeah. Cases country went way lockdown started rising borders opened people went holiday sprees countries worse numbers less restrictions brought virus back again. double IC occupation (Netherlands), 2/3 population.

Can anyone explain why? yes, I'm sure behavior lax, extremely slow lax ourselves... even joke. I'm gonna spending like drunken sailor next months. I've working entire time others lucky. Got someone yard next months even though mower still working home. Yes, selfish. standard Sweden pretty well. fact lockdown restrictions. Lesson hopefullly learned. love slogans. Guns kill people, bullets do. Blah blah blah. Talk virus. Maybe work deal. Why? Lucky mfers  Gee wonder told say this.... told dad wear two masks tomorrow, vote early. Virus lock us down. people do. r/angryupvote Yeah that‚Äôs going win exactly nobody give people wanting wear mask good reason call crazy. Nah, ain't shit. major obstacles solved them?

There major obstacles recall reading spring vaccine far guaranteed since coronavirus vaccine kind never produced before.

There's vaccine canine coronavirus common use time already. dogs, obviously.

As humans, currently 7 coronaviruses infect us:

- 4 cause cold vast majority people. Together make 15% cases common cold.

- SARS-CoV causes SARS, quite threatening first appeared, contagious spread stopped thanks contact tracing quarantines.

- MERS-CoV causes MERS, localized outbreaks. still pops time time, contagious enough cause widespread outbreak. is, however, quite dangerous.

- finally SARS-CoV-2, causes COVID-19.

Now vaccines previously known coronaviruses? 4 common cold ones simply worth effort. Research funding limited making vaccine affects single one viruses therefore reduces number cases cold percent considered worth effort.

SARS longer present wild. research vaccines going on, funding dried up. case, vaccine would never approved even development continued candidate needs prove prevents disease, hard disease longer present.

MERS ongoing vaccine development, continuing threat, although major one. Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine actually continuation work Oxford researchers MERS vaccine. COVID-19 hit, repurposed earlier efforts new virus, able hit ground running. governor get teaching job American :D

Until beginning January moment, extended anyway. Yeah I'm seeing lot dumb excuses. ""It's important mental health wear mask I'm neighborhood"" ""what I'm middle field"" etc. wear damn mask stop whining, mean FFS...  wonder recording quality would stop kind mass deployment. Wish 'fleeing country' money curiosity, kind values important Germans care about? ""Last month, Mellors Dimitrov announced discovery Ab8, smaller-sized potent antibody isolated antibody libraries Wei Li, Ph.D., assistant director Center Antibody Therapeutics, also discovered Ab1. Ab8 isn‚Äôt far along development Ab1, smaller molecule, could potentially administered subcutaneously even inhalation, might make practical widespread use.""

So I've reading several types inhalers time fast widespread use. guess we'll wait upcoming updates Seriously, Boris Johnson idiot too.

But thing he's better Trump he'll learn mistakes

And Trump won't. Agreed. Take two people vote tomorrow. concede anything, opinion. level cheating conducted, see Biden prevail. Polls reflect intentions people. reflect intentions thwarted. So, may true maj ity eligible v-ot ers want vote by-den, may also true many botes discarded, disallowed, blocked, quashed ways cast aside allow cri mi nal ""win."" one person either really unlucky needlessly reckless. county posts cases quarantine teachers students weekly. 2 weeks ago 350 quarantine last week 800! live big county. scary see increase state plates! People think time vaca? üò≥üò∑ yet people think I‚Äôm insane going bars friends even though us got covid summer. People should't talk all.
The whole situationwith COVID-19 happening due failure. Well listens scientists, Germany fine. Disk error Snicker Give rest. I've pretty clear. Go find dead horse beat it. Source this? hope true. :/ unlikely catch virus someone walking running [pass stay house day long except going shops (for wear mask) - walking dog nearby forest mostly deserted - wear mask. way forest see anybody walking give wide berth. I've never stopped talk anyone, I've never stopped anyone, I've never encountered anyone forest see far away could thus take different path avoid entirely. I'm planning change things unless law passed new scientific findings reveal I'm wrong. kind crap perpetuates idea turkey eat it, too.

Even though, took 30 minutes arrival departure people sufficiently distanced outside felt relatively safe. inside polling location less five minutes. wish districts easy. bothers you, could consider wearing gaiter walks? love gaiters, great keeping warm protecting face wind hikes! Oi mate! got loicence swear word?! I've seen people describe something similar COVID positive sub. Thank you.

Wearing masks outdoors sucks, especially hot summer months. get you‚Äôre part big crowd can‚Äôt avoid people, you‚Äôre telling someone wear one quiet walk suburbs, it‚Äôs going dilute message. I'm sorry definition sheep.... Oh wait, shoot.
 
I didn‚Äôt catch that. Lol. 

It‚Äôs supposed definitely too. fewer people denial early on, thousands people would still alive, we'd back normal now. Let's prove tomorrow I‚Äôm mask. believe science. also trust experts medical doctors spent lives stuff. 

I find hard believe Americans stance 90% people see won‚Äôt wear correctly. Maybe I‚Äôm bad area I‚Äôm sure, sucks around people apparently degree pathology sudden. false moral high ground boring. 

Numbers feelings don‚Äôt mix. 

So take elsewhere. Also, testing airports. That's new normal. harmless, deaths people would died regardless due poor health terminal diseases 

None best medecine. Government prescribing sell drug profit

None bad since people go hospital health issues rather staying home thus aggravating disease offsetting lives saved Covid deaths health problems

Are shutdowns people scared virus?  curious works. everyone get 2k ones work? people work make 2k/mo, equalized? know US sticking point lot essential workers think Fauci telling truth want lockdowns. expect people use common sense, personal responsibility, freedom. Believe Atlas. Pretty much US current position first place. Daycare +Religious schools contact tracing proven that? Big difference N95 kn95. Fucking obviously Ain't going happen. Dr. Reiki lowered boom said new measures long hospitals bursting. yeah. think 8 people memory Trump manages lose never hear again. almost certain That's bad idea. CDC says credibility left let‚Äôs go ahead start spewing nonsense! no

the enemy virus poverty. people. Thanks. I'm considering bulk buying glitter throw them/ property retaliation. Hahaha that's got it! forget 40 million Americans STILL never got $1200 stimulus, including me.

So can't pay rent get small latte üôÉ Trump talking firing again. Hold people this? Also Sweden skyrocketing come herd immunity bullshit.

Skyrocketing what, please tell me, close! pity da foo tries give coronavirus. they're going double regardless wins crazier conspiracies explain mounting deaths. going bad. watching Congress acted last 4 years predict one darkest periods country's history. Obligatory ""but hope I""m wrong"" comment. Whataboutism bring back kids die.  No, SARS stamped quarantining infected close contacts. giving away willingly.  knew that's would go end?

have missed anything?

Just places atypical, mean classification doesnt stick. Nope, screaming CDC downplaying January. seem confused. people without common sense refuse wear mask first place. Thanks guys. it‚Äôs mandatory everywhere can‚Äôt follow simple rules. Wow line. kids struggling depression suicidal thoughts they're alone? 


There options without suffering. Oh, know. used live rural NY. still despise party due national level actions. pats suck too. like since Day 1 worldwide might left shit behind us now. no... think telling repeat test coming months. 6-8 months still really early

They 45+ days. So, 1.5 months. confused.. republican? That's even funnier. thought said definitely typo defiantly. Well got there, reminds George Carlin quote.. 

""Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that."" Exactly. bars indoor dining, totally cool. theatre. That's way far know longer safety control. Maybe wife listen actual experts husband trying explain it. doesnt take phd know wearing mask saves people. don‚Äôt care that. reasoning exactly things get Kafka-esque. Soon common sense won‚Äôt rare, won‚Äôt exist all. Replaced rules procedures tailored procedures. Dehumanizing. it. even safety‚Äôs sake. Yes, we're aware that's works, that's there's gigantic pandemic 100s thousands lives lost global economy gutter. Many people never even tried wearing masks social distancing, what's excuse? can't sick never even it. This. listen extremists paint SF shithole. beautiful diverse place. fact isn‚Äôt standard everywhere unbelievable. One worst countries world handling COVID everyone wearing mask times public. Unreal. mean, Trump really done handling even fair compare. least country gone insane. Don‚Äôt worry. lot people required vaccinate want remain employed send kids school. None. immunocompromised siblings relatives. /s Assumes multiple rooms isolate. could kids gone. still home would mess disagreement politically nothing like what‚Äôs happened US. Mainly states closing borders states (which still ongoing degree) going mainly online schooling times PM maintained schools stay open. Early created National Cabinet state premiers (we 5 states 2 territories say ‚Äústates‚Äù time) PM would meet via zoom decide national strategy PM would address nation advise happening. states could move speed within framework depending situation. example, Northern Territory (and states) lot isolated indigenous communities knew covid got would horrific NT closed borders everyone else early states closed travel isolated areas protect people living there. 

We lucky stopped flights China time US went big step stopped anyone entering countries 20 March except returning Aussies 14 days mandatory quarantine (so sorry, quite visit really can). many people didn‚Äôt stick rules changed 14 day hotel quarantine that‚Äôs still place (as ban anyone coming unless Australian although recently created travel bubble NZ). Yes, Melbourne Victoria issues hotel quarantine Covid slipped resulting outbreak, huge shame would well didn‚Äôt happen. days zero cases even though started opening looking good restrictions eased earlier planned. 

I think one difference US Australia ‚Äúmate-ship‚Äù culture look mates community, whereas many people US seem care personal freedom. Don‚Äôt get wrong, it‚Äôs generalisation people don‚Äôt fit sides care freedom I‚Äôm sure Americans care fellow Americans whole seems like overall willing temporarily give personal freedoms greater good community.

We also good financial support businesses individuals help people situation - still ongoing. 

I‚Äôve following situation US year including riots watching live White House briefings, etc. I‚Äôve absolutely stunned what‚Äôs happening there. Unfortunately think global image USA severely tarnished. nearly daily basis would talk husband say ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt believe said today‚Äù. I‚Äôll following election. really hope things go well I‚Äôm concerned may violence either way. 

Obviously result win you‚Äôll same, changes happens January 20? much done change things country limbo then? Either way doesn‚Äôt sound like good position country heading winter bad covid situation. change PM election sworn 10 days later 3 months... 

I‚Äôm glad hear you‚Äôre everything stay safe. early days didn‚Äôt things control relieved didn‚Äôt seem affect kids badly (I‚Äôve got 2 little ones) thought we‚Äôd probably get stage healthy okay. unknown side effects long term issues people I‚Äôm super grateful living normal life worry it. now. really feel there, especially health care workers. Americans approve farts POTUS, new poll finds. Literally stole words mouth. anything, people get less complacent seeing stuff like this. US needs EVERY STATE mask mandate public INDOOR spaces. 

I seen single person go maskless inside store since April. almost never see people wearing masks outside. Greater Toronro area. don‚Äôt get vaccine new normal morons praising politicians making us wears masks inside homes. Masks minor inconvenience. wore mask 18 hour flight. understand people continue fight wearing mask minutes leave house. nothing whatsoever said. projecting.

I took issue mindset willfully gives one's choices someone else save ""trouble"" will. antithetical individualist nature. importantly, expecting vaccines prevent transmission. do, bonus perk secondary goal reducing severity disease. Mods, get headline fixed? source article clear first doses could ready general public end first quarter 2021. headline implies end year, source talking results ready end year submittal regulatory agencies. 

For reason, nearly every article AZ vaccine either misinterpreted folks sub article missing key details rollout steps. one latest. Yeah, many billions spend missiles year? guys even single aircraft carrier! We've got 11!

I see extreme social distancing much less sustainable. I'd like see elderly family members day. agree, deal discomfort necessary, is, indefinitely, need set reason ability limits sustainable solution. I‚Äôm southern NH work restaurant everyone coming drink. see many Massachusetts licenses many people mentioned strict rules Mass. üòï seems like every day I'm reading another article businesses refusing comply shutdown orders. even worse shutdowns first started. feel like problem enforcement, people wear masks. serious consequences, people refuse accept small inconvenience save lives. Local governments need take much heavy handed approach. restaurant opens indoor dining, close permanently. Revoke business license may restrict owner ever operating business again. Rules serve purpose consequence breaking them. see even 8 months in, somehow still familiar Sundays. Cases 18k day last week, 24%, outpaces 20% weekly growth estimate bit.

When spoke 7 day average 81k daily, 86k daily.

In 12 days numbers higher. See then. Check back leave state! way people like causing virus stick around, it‚Äôs inevitable. know large scale testing done? Batch testing? Also, testing stations set up? 

They using quick antigen tests produce results 15 minutes. Roughly 5000 testing sites set (similar elections) 2 medics, 1 policeman, 1 soldier 2-4 administrative workers. came, queued minutes (in morning even hours many people came), gave ID, took test, waited 15 minutes gave medical certificate result. biggest problem medics, volunteer (it obligatory come), managed recruit enough (they gave good money came). batch testing, every person antigen test charge them?

 Slovak Armed Forces + administrative workers cities/villages set / follow cases, like contact tracing etc?

People tested positive get touch doctor, inform closest self-quarantine. centralized contact tracing, would impossible many people. quarantine / isolation protocols like? enforcement done?

They rely people responsible Army/people government random checks people tested positive see really self-quaranteened. Plus policemen streets + shops + work people check got negative certificate. closest supermarket pharmacy, get hefty fine. **sage advice** lump communal housing that. necessary thing many places due housing costs. think laws wearing clothing public? United States made different States different policies. north east west handled pretty well since initial surge. They've quicker shut bars shut areas cases rising. rest country pretty terrible. average might enough keep Europe. vaguely recall reading somewhere Tcell response declines precipitously advanced age, consistent age based mortality figures covid. rules purpose. I'm running alone, outside walk 8:30pm nobody around, *outside* wife wife only, wide open space wife nobody around government permission come **ticket me** **arrest me** 'well, that's rules!'. rules made enforced circumstances measurably public interest. Otherwise government clawing needless power.

Yes, affect wear mask times (besides personal comfort). guess what? examples brought *it affect either*. anything get attention. really worst disease. dangerous itd easier control people would take seriously. less itd fine ignore like swine flu. right middle mandate removes ambiguity enforcement. truly somewhere nobody around, there'd nobody ask put mask on. around people however, can't bullshit way reprimanded claiming 6ft away. closing loophole people exploited, makes enforcement easier.

Just wear damn mask outside home. like people asked chop finger. strip fabric. Melbourne win! Zero new cases 4 days now. 

The anti-maskers understanding science civic duty. Well technically we'll get proper herd immunity eventually even vaccine gets developed. forecasted take 5 years rate we're going...a vaccine greatly accelerate speed timeline

Edit: apparently 50-65% population enough get limited herd immunity. See Zika virus 63% natural immunity. use eventually useful. think gonna quick fix  nw bro. important note 6 months ""at least"" thing well. disease around long enough attach endpoint number  know lot people early days went China Thailand 2 weeks Australia get around Australia's travel restrictions China.

that's really getting around it. 2 weeks they're safe anyone that's always Thailand. like 2 weeks isolated quarantine good COVID-free without testing needed.

""getting around it"" would like going one country another, immediately hopping flight 3rd country, travel bans work. pass virus whales pass entire pod, maybe whale species dolphins accompany whales pretty often? good deed might end calamity. That's kinda entire point rapid testing. difficult all. There's need several times per week. Masks work. 

Melbourne, Australia recorded 4 consecutive days cases. 

Mandatory masks, social distancing, lockdowns reduced us high 700 cases day 0 100 days. 

It's shit. works. Hope good thing think one biggest issues covid contagious people spread without symptoms. means effective measures need taken early possible take 2-3 weeks start impact. takes lot guts impose restrictions massive cases deaths payoff huge. hand, countries drag feet impose restrictions late run real risk overwhelming hospitals running health care workers ground exhaustion worse, infection. One benefits Australia took action March closed international borders foreigners imposed quarantine returning citizens well implementing measures stop spread Italy going crazy. track weeks behind people could see would didn‚Äôt act. Guys, please screw things there. still need place escape shit really hits fans... don‚Äôt know parents kids teachers. next gonna stop vaccinating kids shit Glancing core study? less ""the weather impact COVID-19 spread"" ""the impact weather ***by itself*** negligible impact COVID-19 spread... compared potential factors"".

Namely, wearing goddamn mask. Seriously. Wear damn things.

Basically, use metaphor: temperature impact core body temperature... set fire. *Selfish people selfish things* ...^in ^large ^gatherings. Meanwhile cheap steroid work gets virtually zero mention restaurant thing drives insane. unsafe. ""A recent CDC study roughly 300 adults tested positive found twice likely eaten restaurant two weeks getting sick compared people infected."" otherhand, could also mean kind idiots think sitting room unmasked strangers somehow okay probably take kinds risks fly face known viral behavior. hand, anything CDC publishes days relied on? Common sense tells us nothing inside restaurant full unmasked people prevents viral spread. you‚Äôre happy government this, you‚Äôre sadistic control freak pray never power individuals ""It is"" I'm impressed lad close You‚Äôre empirically wrong. single ticket written masks start now. tell cop ""health condition"" there's nothing do. Everyone already knows this. Baker's order attempt appease whiny morons never leave homes begin with. Besides, cops give shit masks rarely use themselves. kidding? entire timeline laid Trump handled better president would have. google ""Dan Crenshaw covid timeline"" see beginning idea Trump handled well.

At least 1/3 country lives entirely different news universe. They're delusional they're fed steady diet alternative facts think everyone else getting fake news.

Oh wait - guess right makes delusional. Pretty much this. time accept restaurants bars cannot exist covid. They're clearly huge spreading areas. Give rent relief unemployment workers actually keep rest economy running well virus control.  are. People wear mask leave house, go subway, reach restaurant, take mask eat friends small, unventilated room dozens people. finish, put mask again, return home, wear mask presence family members roommates, who've things. ER overwhelming chest pains, sure tell doctor. want give ultrapotent blood thinner might accidentally keep alive. logic terrible.  jack o'brien, you?  Everyone poses threat literally misinformation. Slightly Lol it‚Äôs going waived missed know stop virus - stop people different households getting close contact other.

""Just"" something logistics resources do. Yes, since March. person touch time, outdoor flu shot clinic give shot. inside anywhere except apartment, doors outside indoors. everything delivered brought me. 

I'm physically disabled risk, home health aides run errands. Difference make drop stuff outside, pick trash recycling etc outside well. might bit mess inside since coming help me, least putting risk covid could definitely kill me. careful though hurt overdoing I'll let aide in, I'm basically one kluzty fuckup away unable get bed. I'm walking metaphorical tightrope, trying overdo hurt badly need aide come inside I'm high risk death catching covid, hurt enough chores home complete pit enough make need hospital help getting bed/transferring/bathing etc.

It's pretty exhausting awful, normally I'm getting help physical tasks, normally I'm going physical therapy 2-3 times week help decrease pain level keep moving well. sick though, keep something makes things less risky, like vaccine.

I really wish excruciating try change bedsheets without help. aunt got Influenza seatmate coughing row Delta flight, complications made go downhill, died 5 months later. fine fatal flight.

So old and/or frail, infection, infection, beginning end, regardless age. know look. get time. Probably should.

I‚Äôm excessive masks. one vest wear work well 3 others work bag. (An extra BLM 2 company masks.) 2 vehicle. I‚Äôve also hidden mask longer caught guard gf‚Äôs desire take them. work I‚Äôm cut main world 13-16 hours per shift tendency contingencies place. easy sift info back Jan Feb, that‚Äôs sure. full-time job put pieces together. 

Just happy info getting getting long time ago.

At least, hopefully it‚Äôll drive people mask (and actually cover nose).

Stay safe! Dude literally called number pressed 1 two times many people checked accidentally received (multiples) returned it; many people intentionally received knowing didn‚Äôt qualify needed it; many people intentionally applied didn‚Äôt qualify didn‚Äôt need it. Whenever Canadas ‚ÄúIRS‚Äù mass investigates fraud lose money investigating. narc someone benefit similar basically work anon tips small business fraud. legislation said one truly punished, it‚Äôs possible may pay back it‚Äôs basically assumed it‚Äôll waived point. It‚Äôs taxed income country extremely high income tax (generally) 13% sales tax well time high consumption cannabis alcohol &amp; cigarettes (extremely high sin tax goods buy liquor literal liquor bureau Ontario.....). mostly went paying rent... could go you‚Äôll receive misinformation. also saw uproar bootlegging northern communities since died due (sort of) ending (‚Äúunemployment‚Äù aka employment insurance lasts year many got raise included ever paid it). Hope makes sense. issue order stop snow falling wants. doubt would change anything could order it. Yes, crazy mentality. know pioneers cowboys Kansas got disease? died. That's 12 children replacement stock. possibly get organ damage disease. fail see dangerous? Europe fully re-opened schools new school term started, U.S. much cautious re-opening schools. nothing ""neoliberal"" conspiracy ""free market"". Set date see. Next summer. going happen unless rapid test appears, vaccine develops virus mutates something less virulent. Without one developments, summer like corona shit-show. Bets? What?lol That‚Äôs remotely true....  mean Patriots play home games another state now? saying that‚Äôs problem wonder how‚Äôll they‚Äôll handle since obviously can‚Äôt play football wearing masks beginning. No, mentality stupid I'm helping kill thousands country.

Where im wear mask soon leave house last months helped along measures. new positive results starting get back normal. long time ago naysayer. anecdotal scary stories countries, testing still even sketch now. ü§û blame UN Deep State instead? Talk virus, us. can't help you. cut chase start offering funerals flight. got zoom? in: businesses ordered close usual times people advised go home sleep night. speaking personally, pretty frickin hard social distance. think see them, saw them. Oh, saw them. wasn‚Äôt months ago we‚Äôd post others getting twice - proved multiple doctors you‚Äôd think starting WW3. Many thought impossible. Well, know have, video helps, reputable sites sharing info.

Happy hear 2nd time around lot better. many, always case. never know virus. Different everyone.

Stay safe folks - key get once. featured couple packing Australia, easy right now. many flights here, lots Aussies overseas want return home limited seats available, hotel quarantine get here. migrating foreigners? Near impossible. Look German system. CNBC good series Healthcare system. many Germany like want improved, would perfect fit US. would cheaper. Daily reminder world revolve around American politics San Francisco Bay Area like currently. speak u/crusoe think part referenced cancer testing also mentioned. FDA well. blacklabeled HCQ outpatients purely political reasons. implement real form socialized care...

But incentive make healthcare expensive!? doctors still high earners. important thing socialized care would cut exorbitant medicine hospital costs. people say ""nobody around"" still run less 6ft person pass

The risk kind momentary exposure outside low. I‚Äôm sure cases demonstrated come kind situation. I‚Äôm sure happened somewhere, extremely rare.

It would great everyone country could keep mask crowd indoors though, minimize possible avoid situations altogether, mask mask (in particular, means indoor bars/restaurants, movie theaters, everyone working home whenever possible, minimized in-person school, ...). really focus efforts.

The 6ft rule fairly arbitrary, shouldn‚Äôt relied strictly. going sit near someone hour indoors poorly ventilated room, probably like 30 feet, maybe ‚Äúnope distance‚Äù. someone jogs past fraction second outside, you‚Äôre almost certainly fine even come within 3 feet.

(Of course, doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone wear masks even low-risk situations.) groceries something heavy passenger seat damn thing starts beeping half mile road can't move them. Aww fit agenda everyone gets covid dies?

No incredibly dumb extent borders comedy.

You well school you? Really? wearing mask walk around one else killing thousands? fear pushed sub, dont wear mask street, get oxygen starved brain, might save cells seems excessive, car, don‚Äôt think wearing mask help Chance get infected means chance die time. can't everyone wear damn mask outside home, worry it? You‚Äôre dingus don‚Äôt understand scientific method adjusting view based gained information. parrot told. It‚Äôs unsurprising people actually enjoy living fascism long benefits them. can‚Äôt argue stupid. Stop trying. frustrate you. Rona DeathSentence stinks. hope he‚Äôs ok! Sending good vibes forgot add, money got inflated Trump friends got richer pandemic. Cold worse. Fogs glasses instantly. answer jumps mind contact national embassy possible information. might feel like contacting embassy like taking nuke knife fight, encourage assertive giving try. Even turns nothing you, part responsibility. living South Korea partly paid for. exist help serious problems. would qualify pandemic serious problem citizen living abroad.  don‚Äôt think tell people expect give public health measures anytime soon,‚Äù said.

Saying opposite. Every single day idea waiting vaccine therapeutics less reasonable we're honey dicked mid 2021, late 2021, 2022, years, etc.. Also central plot point Inuyasha. MA, 2-5 years recommended wear tolerate mask. 2.5 year old finally started wearing mask last week. also live MA. read ""Charles Barkley"" total wtf second lmao Hey dickhead, three main islands ignorant twat, concentrate getting shit sorted out.

No one boasting *anywhere* except Orange Orangutan Whitehouse claims defeated virus ""turned corner"" cases hit maximum ever.

230,000 dead Americans disagree.

We done great job anyones standards, keep great job, one take away us regardless bitter bullshit failed governments north.

Why focus frustration *actual* people harming you?

Enjoy winter... want -potentially- extra protection traditional cloth mask, look KF-94. rated fairly close N-95, made South Korea fairly easy get online. Well guys, pack up. Coronavirus Alberta officially Yup, waited long even calling pandemic unconstitutional? Eh going hospital I‚Äôd say 50% coworkers don‚Äôt want get vaccine. accepting keep working. Though I‚Äôve already hearing people plan get around There‚Äôs definitely lot people backcountry currently, I‚Äôm worried bad splitboarding gonna year many people going backcountry without experience avalanche training/proper equipment.  Interesting statistic, considering [Fauci involved approved Trump's handling coronavirus FYI states mail ballots all. cdc government source says can't vote sick without giving alternative vote, would considered voter suppression. never make sure sick person get test results back time catch people sick starting day one. especially difficult socially engineer right wing sourced article liberal publication. appeal instinct balance. trying smirk lose nose glasses.  Looks like relied wrong comment. 

All same, it‚Äôs overreach. cuts excuses weak minded selfish folks pretend legitimate. not. I‚Äôm sure what‚Äôs hard with

Outside 6 ft away, dont dont mind do

Everywhere else wear mask get used it. Besides looks badass wearing mask hood, we're colder months. want ninja? it. -Nike won't. penny ante law. time cop tries enforce little law risk careers shoot someone attacks news ""cops kill man wearing mask"" senators declare murder chairs. worry, look lists potential biden cabinet appointies, Warren it. Yeah honestly surprised see senate block next stimulus favor supreme court confirmation. sure possible stimulus important. Show's knows.

Come 11/4 whole thing goes away, like miracle.

If turns hell heaven watch Trump tortured eternity. recent study found rally could resulted 260,000 cases. study criticized faced questions conclusions methodology yet peer-reviewed.

Per USA Today Shit, go tried give people benefit doubt. handle responsibility. I'm guy see wearing mask car. put mask leave touch unless disinfect hands first. easier leave get home rather cleaning hands time fiddle it. 

I've wear mask 8 hours day work since March see big deal wear two hours running errands.  except condominium narrow walkways hundreds people live, everyone needs walk walkways get units

It frustrating subreddit? Masks make look like Ninja even you‚Äôre wearing Khakis holiday sweater. 

Masks = Yes.

No Mask = Ninja. harm anything it? people complaining wearing masks people wake put clothes everyday  I'm opposed Trump's immigration policies. could bringing health care workers abroad right now. big reason we'll triaging care. worried never going appointed biden position.  already wear mask around people, wearing people?

Isn't easier wear whole time, rather moving around face, taking putting on?

What drawbacks against? idk dude stop give kiss Yeah we're going epic vaccine disposal, hundreds millions doses, know vaccinate end pandemic asap that‚Äôs Trump idiots refuse wear masks follow guidelines restrictions. Selfishness ignorance blame here. Protip: Taiwan Gold Card. Check out. maybe literally inaudible frequencies make difference? Yeah live central major city people streets sidewalks wear masks, even they're outside walk something. feel like Americans dense consider situational safety regards masks safer everyone wear anytime we're public. Scary cuz can't tell joking not. Melbourne, Australia 0 cases today, looking crossroads see everyone walking around mask on, despite mostly 30ft apart walking solo.

They appear oppressed, terrified, fire whatever nonsense happening thread. problem people can't trusted behave.** let mask 6ft away, they'll keep getting closer 6ft people without masks on, claiming close. closing loophole people exploiting. people exploiting loophole, need closed, dishonest impolite shitheads ruin people truly keeping distance, mandates like make enforcement easier. definitely unbuckle every red light note, one would hope pollsters corrected 2016 error. Yup, hygiene theater finest. FFS, indoor dining still open. can't even get takeout enjoy coffee bagel open park. eat inside shitty 2BR share 2 roommates, god forbid actually risk getting Covid dining indoors since outdoor seating almost always taken up. 

The whole wEaR MaSk moralizing getting tiring sub elsewhere. Let's work smarter, harder. I've always worn mask mowing lawn. Horrible allergies. 

While people looked oddball before, they've taken looking oddly, slowing down, occasionally yelling shit. 

I'm glad mow lawn months. Winter removed awkward time. don‚Äôt provide numbers whatsoever? Another great success, brought Gov. Ron DeSantis Dude wearing mask exercising literally make better it.

And yes, reason, you‚Äôre breathing heavy exhaling more, you‚Äôre literally breathing clouds spit air breathe in; cold dry winter travels much further. 

Honestly yeah, see ruining fun sport. argument there. I‚Äôm 85-95% sure back April, even don‚Äôt symptoms peak shape, you‚Äôre potentially ruining someone else‚Äôs week life. 

I baby daughter can‚Äôt comprehend mental anguish would gone gotten (because coworker on). 

Choose selfish, choose good neighbor, good American, good sport this. 

We make sacrifices, hate wearing mask hate worse mom hasn‚Äôt able hug granddaughter recent half daughters life. 

I absolutely judge blame selfish irresponsible people this, I‚Äôm willing lose friends it. 

If OK dress code ‚Äúdon‚Äôt walk naked public‚Äù, fine dress code ‚Äúwear mask others safety, maybe helps too‚Äù.

Don‚Äôt selfish. believe you. don‚Äôt know many people irresponsible 2 weeks, especially came masks. Trump giving misinformation flat lying. Texas, idiot Governor constantly undermining smart local decisions County city leaders.

As whole, Americans haven‚Äôt taken virus seriously needed to. want believe confidence interval election forecast smaller confidence interval sports prediction, conceivably could massive. 

I'd actually like see data quantifying accurate 538's sports models are, vs election forecast models. COVID-19 continues spread across Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont said state soon retreat third phase reopening restrict restaurants social gatherings, also asking residents remain home 10 p.m. 5 a.m.  putting restrictions statewide basis make sure don‚Äôt severe things later,"" Lamont said Monday afternoon briefing. ‚ÄúStay safe, stay home much otherwise careful.‚Äù   state‚Äôs chief operating officer, Josh Geballe, added state‚Äôs mandatory Phase 2 rollback recommended stay-home advisory attempt avoid ‚Äúworst case scenarios"" currently predicted experts.  rollback changes go effect Friday, restaurants required scale back maximum indoor capacity 75% 50%, restaurants entertainment venues required close 9:30 p.m., exception takeout.

I'm sure would much rather people listened advice. know thing started going hell way election right? Let's ignore fact dozens viruses waiting wings. destroy environment, likely nature exercise potent natural selection methods. 

As much I'd like forget happened return normal:

Those learn past...etc  One points brought going work sick. friend mine mentioning day seems weird, ""old normal"", considered (more less) acceptable people go office raging cold. thought realized true - colleagues would literally boast never use sick days (despite sick). in, weird badge honour go work sick.

So I'm hoping one one positive changes coming thing going work visibly sick going much, much stronger stigma around used to, people knock shit going forward. like Spanish flu.... mask use :( know ones I‚Äôm talking about... interest defending google, anonymous metadata sold companies egregious GOVERNMENT tracking every move. speak American constitution. example, speak second amendment speak ‚Äúall Americans.‚Äù still defend it. defend Edward Snowden, nation unsung hero nation weirdo cares ‚Äúa citizen‚Äôs privacy government‚Äù really. People fail realize ""This can't nice things"" moment. tried telling everyone wear masks within distance others, stores, etc. someone living state, tell many people ignoring advisement. 

This literally saying ""There longer interpretation think wear mask. Put fucking thing on"" Wear mask outdoors, wear mask indoors, wear camera make sure following rules. broke rules lock house two weeks. left house, put reeducation camps. That's slippery slope. know hyperbole, come we're talking Mass, Florida. Idaho. Same. think best way reopen schools start special education students don‚Äôt ability distance learn, preK-2nd students person. See goes, gradually phase grades in-person. cases I‚Äôm seeing schools middle high schools. decided go full-steam ahead county in-person school. think making broad statement ‚Äúall kids need back school‚Äù taking multitude variables parents consider ‚Äî family health conditions, work schedules, finances, area Covid stats, schools‚Äô safety plans (or lack of), child‚Äôs ability wear mask day follow social distancing rules, child‚Äôs ability distance learn ‚Äî on. matter decision parents know made, even it‚Äôs different decision, would never call ‚Äúbad parent.‚Äù Well, except handful parents trying get Covid precautions face masks removed schools, they‚Äôre stupid.   Voter intimidation finest Governor DeSanitizer lived name. post bunch stuff you, Polish. required wear mask authoritarian required cover genitals asshole public. strip fabric, blood oath. Good thing hate wearing outdoors too. sucks even summer. didn‚Äôt even suffer bad economy. Full wage replacement assistance businesses could gotten us worst lockdown ramped testing capacity, ppe production, contact tracing quarantine procedures. tamp virus everything comes back without deep losses jobs housing. look countries actually handled it. V-shaped recovery real. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wondering cared [that British Newswipe / Black Mirror say masks. medical professionals never make decision.

I hope remains true, fears. actually matter stopping spread rather try overwhelmingly exhaust people restrictions, you‚Äôd much effective overall response.

From someone living Mass, he's overly restrictive, IMO. largely opened state last months, communicated things go hill reverting. shitshow 2500-3000 cases per day, got 200-300/day rapidly climbing again, currently sitting like 1500/day.

Walking around, many people treat wearing mask optional. see people day every day walk around mask around neck passing people, sitting sidewalk smoking, etc. etc.

He's trying prevent another nightmare state. think he's overreacting tell people wear masks don't, else besides require law? literally one ""This can't nice things"" moments.  Terrible take that‚Äôs totally fine.

When cases drop, restrictions lifted good get vaccinated amazing feeling! Hey, OP? Maybe next time [link actual CDC article that's almost entirely vote avoiding infecting infected instead like 2 paragraph ad-filled article pulls single line said article notes voters right vote.

Especially article question inflammatory title like that. They're saying perfectly fine vote person virus, they're saying people right (because police officers going ""You, Black Lives Matter shirt, prove infected COVID-19 leave polling place"" bad idea). remotely going defend everything CDC's done pandemic, article fucking nothingburger. Common sense window Fact matter is, even setting police fascist sympathizers pushing Trump agenda selectively enforcing regulations... actually enforcing law 40% population openly breaking logistically challenging say least. 100% policy idiots keep finding excuses wear masks: can't follow rules we're gonna remove every possible loophole. want go there. tax money funds why? Consider guy replied massive agenda him, really. like opposition Argentina. also supports certain president US, know mean.  man. Obviously, difficulty enforcing orders previously; common sense trick. Headline typo existed time posting Yeah that's happening. building fucking trash. trying run kind ant hive mind. Society doesnt need everyone others do. No. conversation facts numbers. party. 

Also lame digs social life are...well...lame. mine. employer terrible contact tracing etc however can't go work fever, check us daily arrive work.

The fever one thing employees draw line at. good way pick COVID easy route many taken. first. lmao hit ""no u"". enjoy bringing blu ray copy west wing knife fight states do. also seen anyone maskless indoors since April. real issue generally small groups homes. Friends, families. One person goes dinner gets it, hangsout friends little gives them. Mask mandates require mask eating, nobody follows mask mandate home. laws really target actual cause transmission. saying approach works, really easy? Ur delusional one offense need worry pattern unless persists past day 10 symptoms starting.  persisted beyond 11 days, consult doctor, buy pulse oximeter find number go hospital at.  Start recording blood oxygen levels daily drops 98. Right? Also, affects almost one? get it, get better, therapeutics available now? Don‚Äôt we?? /s I'm trying prove care numbers, lives. 

You must fun parties. /s

That is, assuming ever get invited anywhere. still thing? dems supermajority congress, pass law forcing appoint   Oh man, want live college years like this. want stay late college studying friends, want attend parties used organized campus students association. want talk new people, share moments. degree 5 years first 6 months best life. Yeah, lost half freshman year, covid really put things perspective me. I'm gonna live life fullest stuff reopens grateful every moment. Lmao, trump superspreader expect 10k new cases Illinois tomorrow. NZ went hard instantly, far I'm aware, they're one did. That's worthy discussion, nothing else. nobody ever enforce situation. hard time figuring people area keep bringing up, Baker always clear advisories target people wearing masks around others parties. 

But let's honest, nobody state enforced shit point everything half-measure. need shut up, wear masks, fine hell anybody comply. state fucked, again. time complaining incredibly simple stuff like wearing masks over. tried idiotic stubbornway, work. You... read you?

There absolutely nothing study indicates ""Masks work"".

Edit: Medical masks cloth masks. Cloth masks recommended healthcare workers. Hi live Massachusetts pretty nice here! opinion sucks! Compared country's currency
World wide pandemic Noone saying work 100%, help. study linked shows help, even cloth masks, minorly.

Also cloth masks widely efficacy. I've seen cloth masks can't blow candle matter hard try, cloth masks could blow candles 20th birthday cake one breath. Granted anecdotal part, time given equal. Come on. Go look county counts last 3 weeks. Rural heartlands cities too, know.

I'm saying rural areas. numbers mostly coming populated areas. cares virus nothing cause mild symptoms vast majority populace large spread? That's likely possibility vaccine outcome. goal reduce deaths hospitalizations background normal averages, eradicate covid altogether. Freedom: shops services open, lockdown, travel green lanes discussed nations control

Safety: 28 total Covid deaths since pandemic started, fewer 100 active cases left, 0 critical condition.

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Small sidenote, NRW alone 50% people Belgium too. difference ICU beds per capita akin 2:1, worse 3:1 seems implied. past societal issues Belgium know deeply impoverished crowded immigrant communities, country small would create outsized impact numbers, considering know crowded populations living poverty disproportionately impacted infectious disease spreads directly human human.

Just hypothesis. land within country rural populations numbers would look far diluted. anyone see see issue line thought. know lot young socialist Reddit holy shit. think learn Africa too. know little coverage. NZ alone probably got coverage sub Southeast Asia+Africa combined. Think way... mask protecting others sick, protecting neighbours fellow humans slowing community spread. wearing mean conscientious towards period, twisted mean afraid. already studied shown wearing mask allows blocks breath way stops outside air getting unless mask tight seal face N95 better. mask mandate going issue unfair enforcement. Lawrence 50+ cases per 100,000, really, I'd wearing mask friggin shower lived there. would make sense people fined wearing mask public streets city super densely populated risk high. towns 413 zero cases nothing trees, trees, trees. reason wear mask ride bike town road exercise see soul.

My wife unaffected pandemic, sign program.

Also, excuses wearing mask! remaining friends republican don‚Äôt agree is. even stopped watching Fox News it‚Äôs liberal. 

2020 strange year. Interesting times indeed. know shrug say stuff like, banned travel China else could doctors even know do. Like someone keeping politicizing masks making tweet ""liberate"". Lots prayers makes through. hope enough people vote get adults voted in. Saving lives political. Wow... France really getting hammered. even know many cases missing march. know looks like there's lot right now, probably even close true number infections back then. one says face responds Facebook enabling cultists. 

I'm convinced thinks secretly agree also somehow brainwashed away 3-4 weeks thought old timers end bar coming vent. wonder advice would wave Covid effecting mostly dense cities instead rural heartlands... Umm. disregards science transmission distance. Stop making masks political issue. Hopefully vote fuck dude... Cool. spend days yelling adults wearing masks wrong wearing all. Lots people think ""no one within 6 feet moment means take mask indoors."" could certainly postponed, possibility vaccine released time allows olympics happen almost normal. there's much greater possibility olympic committee figures make isolated community like USA baseball basketball duration olympics. already olympic village, hard adjust wish America lot like Canada. I‚Äôd imagine would way better off. That‚Äôs dumb Love juicy hollywood gossip clickbait rageporn. Keep good posts! First one good. anytime take things governments hands, good move. Trump, Biden, whomever, would mess. many people realistically reflection chose get tested. damn time start winning battle. mean tell new cases/million residents rate 1000/day past weeks going lead lot deaths soon?

Sounds like librul propagander No, deaths per nation. someone Boston area, 100% right. people complaining wear masks matter leave house....ignoring facts nobody area anyway, practically never enforced, measures announced today targeted people throwing parties blatantly wearing masks.

These measures try get assholes follow guidelines, nobody walking street nobody around without mask ever stopped. without mask near people deserve fine point....but still advisories teeth, nothing substantial numbers keep getting worse. Baker keeps issuing advisories failing follow-up, residents fail using common sense common courtesy. 

People state claim smart, logical, &amp; caring we're like rest country: selfish illogical. numbers reactions common sense measures like reflect that. think studies may politically biased motivated.

That's quite claim, especially since Vox leans pretty heavily left. Yeah imagine well. People getting complacent cases going quickly. Something done. Stay safe. Lmao that‚Äôs dumb, screw None. /s

It's like practically raise themselves. /s

They ever go home school. learned nothing reading manga? /s vote Western Mass here! People definitely following rules masks worn time. No, changed stance. Originally said masks solve problem, came said I'm wrong masks work. 

Now trying twist say ""oh meant helped"". 

I never said help, initial reply someone said people wore masks it'd business usual lockdown needing Melbourne shown wrong.  stupid fucking policy. want box pm I'll send link I'm affiliated site got lucky found medical supplier website. Statistically tho school likely die school shooting.

What trying prove here? Hey present\_dweller-under-another-name.

What's cut proceeds spamming?

I legit want know. discussion possible benefits wearing mask isolation outdoors, whether mandate requires wearing mask times. vaccine widely distributed

I really wish people would stop thinking way. vaccine, itself, ultimate goal. ultimate goal community spread reducing low, manageable levels, return normal life.

If happens without vaccine it, that‚Äôs matters.

The vaccine tool help us achieve that. That‚Äôs all.

When go back normal depends virus stops spreading. It‚Äôs simple. make decision every time come across red light middle night streets clearly deserted could obviously run red light safely? spend time observing people, find majority people don't, sit patiently waiting car safety device that's providing obviously safety. it? Partially government told 0.001% chance getting fined partially easier light says make decision every single intersection whether safe enough run red light.

Nobody writing condescending screeds ""sheeple"" sit patiently waiting red light empty intersection. changed one bit. good enough! need demand lockdowns enforce contact tracing, shut schools permanently. convert affordable housing provide people color right vote NOW!

Rapid tests don‚Äôt solve problem alone. make good point, it‚Äôs certainly something considered beginning this. Since surface transmission lower risk, already best avoid it, I‚Äôd rather take tiny bit risk (in opinion), wear mask hiking, biking, etc. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd reevaluate turned bigger risk, lived someone increased risk. Although order good intentions fear it‚Äôs abuse, it‚Äôs really something agree with. R value patients arriving hospital almost 1.1 days go 1 disaster prevented Exactly, lockdown late. ideal situation never impose lockdown, distance enough population beginning it‚Äôs never necessary completely go state.

We‚Äôre going social distance probably there‚Äôs vaccine, need measures R-number below/around 1.0. full lockdowns way necessary, that‚Äôs really last-resort measure you‚Äôre late increased restrictions need stop growing avalanche.

Oh, sorry, read \`what now? really believe said?\` :D 

Well, results still fresh, far, we've informed

a) counties positivity rate higher 0.7% retested next weekend (roughly half counties). 4 initial hardest hit counties tested 3 times! that's going yield good data

b) villages/cities high positivity rate would retested they're counties overall positivity rate less 0.7%. get retested upcoming weeks (so reduce local clusters virus).

c) planning creating one testing site per county available every day. anyone wants sure cold he's actually virus (or might contact somebody long enough would get PCR test) able get tested 20 minutes **for free** (instead paying 70‚Ç¨ PCR test negligible sum money Slovaks)

d) everybody coming country PCR test antigen test dated older think said 10 days. somebody it, testing available borders (for free course).

e) they're repeating repeating still responsible, i.e. whole social distancing thing, wear masks use hand sanitizer. addition that, gatherings 6 people still forbidden, cinemas &amp; fitness centres &amp; swimming pools &amp; restaurants &amp; clubs &amp; bars still closed.

Basically, they're saying ""hey, sure, go ahead, harm!"", they're saying ""...look, we're allowed stop you, fucks sake, infected, crap avoid fucking killing people"". That's actually good virus make opposite case.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause current coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Protease inhibitors consideration virus entry inhibitors prevent cleavage coronavirus spike (S) protein cellular proteases. Herein, showed protease inhibitor aprotinin (but protease inhibitor SERPINA1/alpha-1 antitrypsin) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication therapeutically achievable concentrations. analysis proteomics translatome data indicated SARS-CoV-2 replication associated downregulation host cell protease inhibitors. Hence, aprotinin may compensate downregulated host cell proteases later virus replication cycles. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, primary bronchial epithelial cell air‚Äìliquid interface cultures) four virus isolates. conclusion, therapeutic aprotinin concentrations exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. approved aprotinin aerosol may potential early local control SARS-CoV-2 replication prevention COVID-19 progression severe, systemic disease.

Objectives: COVID-19 patients suffer lack curative therapy. Hence, there

is urgent need try repurposed old drugs COVID-19. 

&amp;#x200B;

Methods: Randomized

controlled study 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate, 11 severe, 11

critical patients) treated 200ug/kg PO Ivermectin per day 2-3 days along

with 100mg PO doxycycline twice per day 5-10 days plus standard therapy; the

second arm 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate 22 severe zero

critical patients) standard therapy. time recovery, progression the

disease, mortality rate outcome-assessing parameters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Results: among patients among severe patients, 3/70 (4.28%) 1/11 (9%),

respectively progressed advanced stage disease Ivermectin 

Doxycycline group versus 7/70 (10%) 7/22 (31.81%), respectively control

group mortality rate 0/48 (0%), 0/11 (0%), 2/11 (18.2%) in

mild-moderate, severe, critical COVID-19 patients, respectively Ivermectin 

Doxycycline group versus 0/48 (0%), 6/22 (27.27%) mild-moderate severe

COVID-19 patients, respectively standard therapy group (p=0.052). Moreover, the

mean time recovery 6.34, 20.27, 24.13 days mild-moderate, severe, and

critical COVID-19 patients, respectively Ivermectin-Doxycycline group versus

13.66 24.25 days mild-moderate severe COVID-19 patients, respectively

It made available CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license .

in standard therapy group (P&lt;0.01).

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusions: Ivermectin doxycycline reduced time recovery percentage 

of patients progress more

advanced stage disease; addition, Ivermectin doxycycline reduced mortality

rate severe patients 22.72% 0%; however, 18.2% critically ill patients

died Ivermectin doxycycline therapy. Taken together, earlier

administered Ivermectin doxycycline, higher rate successful therapy.

Another point touched earlier episode coverage Spanish Flu pandemic flawed due various reasons, actual numbers long pandemic lasted guestimates best.

Let guess, CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Buzzfeed right? logical fallacy think jeoparding people's lives conditions, fact resources left anymore burden COVID-19 healthcare big. Belgium hospitals already full transport patients hospitals simply personnel space left anymore treat everyone. Even survival rate 99.5% 10.000 daily infections admission rate 5% means 500 people 100 go ICU 50 die, daily. single country continously handle influx patients. 

If people actually cared anyone requiring medical attention cancer heart conditions, would actually complied rules took COVID-19 serious get hospitals getting flooded danger COVID-19.  I‚Äôm saying order able afford new program would likely get rid old programs. they‚Äôre shelling thousand dollars month you‚Äôre longer point need given free food, you‚Äôre longer point state needs offer free mental health programs, money spent programs redistributed program affordable. 

There someone news complained 500 million dollar campaign budget. Someone made comment every American could million dollars since 330 million Americans. Well first that‚Äôs millions work makes realize much money would need go program.

If looked Americans aged 21 up, age I‚Äôd opt go would need give 1000 dollars month 200 million people, times 12 months. That‚Äôs 2,400,000,000,000 dollars year. come without eliminating programs. entire national GDP 21 trillion, 10 percent needs get handed Americans. It‚Äôs scary thing think might doable.

Honestly think free education free health care enough. Masks obviously help social distancing US. It‚Äôs business usual private rules slightly enforced people give shit that.

In fact, people give shit strangers think often really shitty people. Thanks China assholes many countries depending public diligence?  Yes ‚òëÔ∏è 
But reality, see poor people always ready share bread needy ones. shame people power enough funds never ready help.

But deniers want act like there's nothing anyone avoid getting Covid-19.


They still want act like wearing masks socially distancing dumb. almost like profits mask use. corruption unreal world. Immunity everyone's lips since pandemic began. Now, pressing ever, infections rapidly rise parts. Immunity depends antibodies - proteins bloodstream fight pathogens viruses. production depends severity infection. immunity COVID may last short period. elderly show significantly faster reduction antibodies young. There's also evidence people don‚Äôt develop immunity all. [read tell he's done anything remotely near led believe.

Watching people whine getting fall drunk money supposedly due job losses overcrowding said bars pathetic. "" lives couple months years now.""

Is anyone sub genuinely thinks life normal 2021? Life gonna completely normal (global scale) least mid 2022. anything Covid jumping species mutates whatever. Millions people infected virus be, takes years subdue pandemic current state.

Nice Germany take them. Learning earlier mistakes failures sign maturity. Please keep tone civil time. Here's latest case/death charts currently 64.96 deaths per 100k. ranks 19th per capita 5th 7-day average deaths per strategy based public diligence mistake?

6000 lives later. Let's try again, man. work time. \*Looking confused numbers Czechia, France, Belgium among others\* indeed clearly offered authoritarian perspective. Google search ""environment destruction viruses"" yields ton scientific articles supporting this.

Not sure actual volume count various viruses that. increased risk jumping species. question simple
If guys world leaders, God given enough funds help needy poor ones, prefer live lavish lifestyle rather helping people.

99‚ÑÖ problems would solved rich ones come helping hand support poor ones.

Unfortunately, never happen bastards like Yes symptoms 30 days back March. people know similar experiences. think recognized logic behind us #1 enemy world, care? We've great last months, things getting worse, new recommendations local restrictions introduced. ignorant.

The people talking like let rip fools. That‚Äôs right, became politicized. Simple fact there‚Äôs less animals viruses mutate. Everybody thought going two month thing they're really disappointed find going one year. People irate wear mask 2021... 

We're lucky we've got many vaccines coming pipe. Mid 2021 Ok. point other, careful people would cancelled trip. Maybe silly risky things ever did, doubt it. kind person travels pandemic money kind person might risky behavior bad reasons. point, old infirm, becomes responsibility protect isolate yourself. 99.9% unaffected compare trump testing anyone rates Biden testing everyone rates hopefully. foresee people wearing masks \*maybe\* mid-2021. People tired regardless deadly reaching breaking point. Going need 3 week lockdown. Personally rather completely scuttle economy would rather focus keeping curve flat. Death toll staggering...I mean 300 deaths province mostly heard one without pre existing comorbidities. 

I realize see selfish opinion know way many non virus negative effects lockdowns going area (alcoholism, drug use, unemployment/bankruptcy, increased divorce rate, mask acne, etc.) hospital/cases low here. 

And people tell know I'm talking about...I know people testing locally roughly many samples flown daily. also covid screening charter airlines. shouldn‚Äôt. People right peacefully assemble nowhere constitution say mask. orders unconstitutional. Outdoor stuff much lower risk, yelling higher risk - produce droplets talk, much yell sing. Japan opened theme parks banned yelling screaming rides, asking patrons ""please scream inside heart.""  office essentially nothing. Older folks wearing masks. people working remotely half time. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Based current research, vaccine able protect Covid infection, fact, even possible say whether vaccine works safe long run.

Because vaccines work expected (it clear beginning, Coronaviruses mutate often), going roll something like mandatory vaccination, least year wear masks even longer this.

On top that, Covid ""threat"" (Infection Fatality Rate \~0.2% 0.05% people 50), going create new sector called Bio Security, every human viewed threat. able participate normal life, without follow rules like vaccinated, mandatory tracking app etc.

If believe me, thats China currently (mandatory app), using Covid reason.

So Bill Gates said going New Normal, meant it.

P.S.: longest Pandemic lasted 18 months. changes going see, permanent.

I even care people going downvote call conspiracy theorist. find things online people even hiding it. example world economic forum (The Great Reset) two people know, family five one child it, rest tested negative.

The family, 3 5 tested positive, two children negative. I'm proud decision aknowledge opinion. Closing borders Europe stop virus. traveled already cases country also target country. took 2 PCR tests trip. virus care borders. cases started rise got colder darker earlier. driving pandemic people home extended family friends safety measurements rules. Oh boy, see real assholes christmas comes around everybody celebrates usual. Yeah, that's part anxiety know person going do. people walk straight lines, sometimes something catches attention something change course suddenly.

One time couple women (could've mom teenage daughter) walking dog side street. masked figured far enough away would pass quickly. dog seemed interested *let dog run right me*. totally spooked. time pull mask pocket put on.

Now, leash pretty long probably remained six feet away me, dog right heels sniffing pants. willing let dog come close signaled taking COVID seriously, sure else might do. 

(FYI, there's mixed information whether dogs carry COVID. Looks like get infected it, known cases carrying humans. Still, happy stranger's dog personal space pandemic.) good news seem better handle treating hospitalized doesn‚Äôt mean hospitals still can‚Äôt overwhelmed Food considered low risk virus primarily respiratory disease, difficult infect breath in. chance getting mouth zero, greatly less getting lungs. extra security, heat food thoroughly wash hands handling containers, heat soap de-activite virus easily. ""Learning live virus"" become euphemism ""let's nothing think virus exist"". Sounds like really good news overall! Go TX med workers! Went exact situation March month. Get bunch Tylenol, electrolyte drinks, thermometer, fingertip pulse oximeter. didn‚Äôt isolate weren‚Äôt able to. Don‚Äôt afraid call doctor virtual consult although reality can‚Äôt help unless hospitalized. Wish ya luck speedy recovery. confirm - hit sorts asking customers masks, make sure me. Frustratingly

I'd tempted try work full hazmat suit arseholes kept coming masks breathing / talking / shouting face. Sorry loss friend, healthcare broken unless millionaire. saying many people don‚Äôt trust vaccine it‚Äôs good people see others take Worldwide saw third deadliest week pandemic two weeks early/mid April Personally think good thing. takes one excuse away anti-vaxxers. can't claim government using ordinary people guinea pigs. said, government officials given vaccine first people like Heads State health ministers definitely make show publicly getting vaccine. Sweden send ICU think survive it. hope they're elective nose shame fool pay attention. Source ? take never actually tried convince two year old wear mask? Like yes, people try hardest get toddlers wear mask, sometimes that's possible. lucked out, two year old likes wearing masks, every toddler like that.

Of course, can't get toddler wear mask (thinking force wear one wishes pretty naive), definitely keep home away people much possible. troll I'd like know more. Sweden rate infections US, 2544 daily cases(each last 4 days) equals 83,188 US cases, ICU Sweden may increase little weeks Lol yup. Honestly Americans bull-headed mentality take whatever hear flip way. understand reasoning almost every single person it. There's always ""But if.."" Ah, China approach see. that, people narrative ignore facts contrary. Way make racist assumption without reading article! Like guy US said hoax died it. plastic barriers poll workers voters, industrial sized quantities hand sanitizer protect everyone, extra pens voters dont reuse pens voters handled, shall continue? means little without factoring respective testing rates. USA - ""Hold beer, rookie numbers"" ridiculous pushes everything comedic level caution. 

Y‚Äôall, seriously. get pushback obsession. called second wave less implied it.

I think get mean talk sustainable strategy. sustainable strategy context one stay place longer amount time. Checks calendar...Labor Day. 

Who could predicted spike Labor Day?! don‚Äôt think trump legal powers fire fauci tho right Trump idiot, increasingly obvious schools causing rise cases. think (note, theory) one aspect maintain-able level. Carlsson mention restrictions get perceived long-lasting one assume restriction would lifted quickly. Let say continues summer next year like usual restaurant restrictions set last to. 4 would harder maintain infection rates go 8 continuously would easier adapt. Learning live assumes one people actually live contracting. said believe Sweden second wave, said countries second wave.

Naturally interesting see admits Sweden second wave.

This man very, hard time admitting wrong though, doubts. Thanks laugh. We're going need today. Maybe OCD? friend exhibiting similar behaviors simply symptom mental health problems. Makes sense, cdc said avoid touching face everytime remove put back mask touching face. clean hand on, got clean hand take get home. today hundreds thousands maybe even million voting I'm Wisconsin. little nervous effect rates couple weeks. broken human. 


Which ironically exactly broken record do. forget railed previous administration ruling EO. like someone's honesty, like child. He's going full North Korea wins today. Quote correctly. respond whole comment, short. 

Tegnellists say avoided second wave. Well. week ago. sure they're saying now. Look sweden subreddit thread. Full them. 

""Who cares"". People seem care. people think second wave. Tegnell says important he's paranoid taking responsibility. he's trying avoid even mentioning second wave name. try frame epistemological problem damage control Swedish state.

I repeat. Nobody said immunity. never heard shit million years Tegnell. ""Actually, calling immunity important. clear definition immunity starts doesn't."" Complete bullshit.  telling people stay homes easiest way, hard way?

We also contact tracing, social distancing, regulating businesses among other, numerous activities. That's pretty horrible, inside knowledge I'll assume probably right, sure pandemic. Thousands lives would saved. Life would different. Instead idiots weaponized. Yum. case must devastated, around 10 times many people dying day causes 1860s. end!? no, think flu, hoax. cops township employees around here. fact downvoted fucking depressing. way keep chucklefucks line. exemptions, exceptions, fat-ass fine. think people get worked mask wearing car thing, guarantee majority people see going two places wear bother take between. quit day job.

..... idiots ""rebel"" it. vaccine helps replicate sort immune response, walking pandemic United States next summer I'm going start running without glasses. can't go entire run foggy glasses, used avoid pulling mask far others. many questions. 

Why higher North America compared Europe Asia? 

My hunch prevalence forced air heating cooling NA. Aren‚Äôt European homes heated radiant (steam, electric, water, district system)? Compared common heat source NA gas fired forced air furnaces recirculate air rooms house. people refuse wear one grocery store even store policy are. people throwing 400 person house parties are. damn president hosting mostly maskless packed gatherings is. People can't get take instead eating indoors 5 times week are.

Some dude walking dog mask not. point wearing mask one around, hence one wears one home. Many us appriciate time effort put need help updates (translation, updates, etc) please let us know. I'm familiar cell memory still concerned we'll need multiple vaccinations yearly stay immune. 

It's still unclear memory cells elicit adequate response reinfection, guess time tell. Definitely projecting. low effectiveness. 40% effectiveness vaccine dangerous. ""vaccinate risk"" people resume normal behavior, 60% still risk. elderly die it, diabetics die also people long term affects. pick environment presents absolute highest risk Coronavirus spread, would there. Enclosed spaces, high volume strangers passing through, opportunity practice physical distancing lots high touch surfaces.

Covid-19 must love there. r/ivermectin pleaseee let cruise line industry die dont even think understand word freedom means.

You mean anarchy, everyone whatever want regardless lil' pandemic.

We freedom act societies best interests regard. keep seeing people upset don‚Äôt think ‚Äúliterally anywhere outside‚Äù clearly considered ‚Äúbeing public‚Äù order, first all

Second all, nobody going fucking punish wearing mask you‚Äôre who‚Äôs going see it. think primary goal previously think need wear mask inside could socially distance, that‚Äôs removed Sadly world full idiots. What's even sadder stupidity puts people risk. Well... kind does. Watch crumbling america money hand stability rest world. compare mask several ton moving vehicle safety belt meant prevent flying car. shit Let's real, crowded. agree people wear masks time places like Boston surrounding areas. However, going get much buy people place like Phillipston. live somewhere those. wear mask I'm going anywhere near people, wear one walk empty street get mail excessive. I‚Äôm can‚Äôt restaurants. get it‚Äôs shit decision make damn think it‚Äôs really bad idea go room bunch people eat...Yeah, wear damn mask. Don‚Äôt walk around outside near people hanging neck. wear it. clergy knows shit guess. ‚Äútraditional‚Äù nursing homes treat patients worse prisoners US. places earth stopped planned/elective surgeries spring, hardly surprising learn hospitals less everywhere thing, exactly reason. Actually, 1ts 2544 per day, US equivalent 83,188, infection rate US right makes sense me. state like Massachusetts, ranked choice voting means Republicans nothing lose everything gain it, since would mean better chance winning votes people fence cautious candidates without next names. Damn chico's taco's ain't ever gunna it?  also live Melbourne. dumb cunt. possibly medical opinion never read book life..... Nothin value üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ live black white world? wear mask whenever go somewhere people, fucking insane expect go get mail. somewhere mask mandate literally able leave house without on.


Not mention people saying bars restaurants havent closed, seems like helluva lot issue dude walking dog. believe everything told covid governments called ""scientists""? deceived tricked believing something true, would know? showing generic clips scientists looking test tubes news takes convinced actually people working cure research ""virus""? simple title ""Scientists doctors"" need give someone credibility without actually knowing background? really believe people run CDC Pharmaceutical companies owned people best interest mind? breathe mask, think air exhale actually goes fabric aware goes openings sides? wear mask, would actually wear one voluntarily? got sick doctors said covid, would believe word think simply cold flu? gonna trust rushed vaccine took less year develop without knowing long term effects? Think responding Good job, proved point him... Yup, she‚Äôs trying distance herself..  287 people died county. 287 people big number here. roughly number high school graduates class 2001. Preventable death something normalized. think probably get fired week regardless election result. Hopefully Joe rehire January.

Frankly think legal fire Fauci, regardless EO. hope somebody challenges it. think to

No, to.

However, guess hospitals receive financial compensation foreign health insurance, currently German ICU beds sitting empty enough German patients fill them. That's Tegnellists. second wave. Tegnell using newspeak Tegnellists said Sweden's strategy worked since avoided second wave. N

What? says ""avoid"" second wave? cares call wave occurs now? Tegnell using newspeak 

I say call second wave. said pretty unimportant, least difficult say ""wave"" starts. soon numbers go treshold? Increase certain period? seem confident something wave, arguing ""I think wave because..."". Perhaps could share definition/conclusion easier understand it.

I also never heard Tegnell say second wave I'm sure find reference. heard quit task force totally due misinformation wear mask home family? Graphic got updated 10/30, watermark bottom.  False equivalence 

Of total deaths, 94% able 70 bono clicking fingers again? placebo-controlled studies

So would placebo be...can‚Äôt really blinded placebo. That‚Äôs works.

There tons studies showing transmission *reduced*, eliminated reduced. think medical professionals wearing masks regular basis ages hell it? Im Omaha entire family still there. Luckily immediate family wear masks, see way many friends Facebook bars gatherings like aren‚Äôt middle pandemic. Don‚Äôt even get started comments see people local news‚Äô Facebook posts covid.

Using heart disease Corona analogy ignores exponential growth problem, central issue it. goes car crashes. High cause age mortality, contagious.  Covid even top 10 deadly diseases world wide... 200k deaths sounds really really scary look annual averages death diseases causes realize 200k tiny number. need stop told afraid think yourself.

I really don‚Äôt think people delay anymore. We've close 1000 sustained whole month October.

If deaths follow % increase cases (with weeks delay), we'll 2000 weeks; case growth showing signs stopping point. Ah hear words already Yes. 156 outbreaks schools across state (one case outbreak, must least 2 separate people). relatively small county three districts cancel person education next weeks, past 48 hours, expect rest county go end week latest. cases active cases, county contact tracers catch up. one district, 1500 students, 250 staff students currently quarantine. face face education experiment seems failed. Disagree. That's *stubborn* looks like. Similar problem tho tbh doubt. store consistently last year, right I'm running 7% 2019, dining room closed since March. even drive-thru; lucky enough walk-up window connected patio could utilize. travel warmer climates. would see jump travel warmer climate supposely warm climates likes virus? 
When people travel, stay indoors. defeats purpose travel pleasure. 75% restaurants set close good surge virus making worse Christmas, expect MAJOR change.

One changes pain food service distributors. know of, occasionally purchases from, two them. made push towards serving public, well know long term danger business models. want people join anti-vax cult. 

Pop-media shown shit. I've looked behind curtain determined fucking retarded anyone believes idiot. Yep, many businesses going hurt severely, they're even saying lockdown may extended past Christmas--Meanwhile, there's 12 Euro countries much higher rates infection UK Well, I'm glad got virus propaganda filled hospitals city. people die die rona, sir. Yes, course want soon possible, too. there's people need me, I'm fine waiting bit longer means safe. Well, one lost home due complete disregard people US government. there's that! fake news! extrapolate thought beyond nose. That‚Äôs realistic downward curve, drop case numbers suggests something wrong testing suggests less spread self-awareness strong suit Boy clever. Needing stay isolated, distanced, wear masks curtail deadly pandemic ALSO invented 2019. Americans literally century ago spanish flu wore masks back too. here's sign Oh, totally mocking people boards. People claimed Polio vaccine initiative put place Africa developing nations funded Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation spreading Polio around countries long time. people branded 'antivax conspiracy theorists', statement September 2020 linked proves actually correct.  curve extremely misleading.

No, isn't.

Let's say right (and probably are)... existence 30m high ocean wave mean 10m high ocean waves come actually waves? course not.

The magnitude part definition makes wave. natural system waves varying magnitudes, still waves.

So even second wave (yet) large first, still wave.  Right?? way they‚Äôre thinking it. It‚Äôs completely design. Ignorance strength. pretty much belongs r/wellthatsucks something similar. ‚Äúnow?‚Äù White house responsibility left chat Lol got there. Bamboozled going away anytime soon. best hope vaccine high efficacy I'm going hold breath either. thing would new treatment significantly reduces fatalities. We've improved regard time expect, death rate drops significantly, things time.

Outside actual threat death, far over.  industries may never recover. businesses learned deal remote workers, many choose allow workers remain remote. Commercial real estate tank. Automakers eventually see fewer sales many people driving much less. Airlines hotels never see business travel saw before.  Restaurants continue close figure adapt.

Even one transported dry ice refrigerated 5 days after, plenty given quickly need distributed. really big deal. Spot on. know someone GM QSR (their inside dining still closed). anecdotal story they're business (entirely via drive thru) pre-COVID, fewer staff.

The restaurants survive likely ones less overhead (e.g. rent) sustain different cash flow situation. place surviving month month, likely toast. Landlords going feel too, much dining space goes vacant. Trying cover ass spreading disinformation guess I'm trying get grand scheme things, getting angry toddlers (who large about) seems like misplaced priority. Like, toddlers mostly ones killing people. people without masks bars, restaurants, private gatherings. guess everything going world, try save anger highest priority threats, toddlers wearing masks waaaaaayyyyy list. Go double check sources. needs cold long term storage. isn‚Äôt issue. means 100 unvaccinated individuals come ten cases, group 100 vaccinated people contract 5 cases. Presumably Covid follows pattern flu highly seasonal. kind statement ‚ÄúTaking trips spending time away home top two contributing factors COVID-19 growth, relative importance 34% 26% respectively‚Äù might apply Covid hardly flu.

This comment replied to. I‚Äôm convinced trying wreck economy fully Entering????? We‚Äôve 1000 deaths per day MONTHS!!! None articles say anything many kids tested. could it, spread home, causing outbreaks across world aren‚Äôt tested. could passing home. bet professors working home. know mine are. No, one could enough. Consistency key think tone pandemic change vaccine rollout imminent, putting us back ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù phase disaster psychology extent. tone shift, occurs predict, make people less disappointed delay plans. Carlin said,

*‚ÄùNow balance scale, I‚Äôd like talk things bring us together, things point similarities instead differences cause that‚Äôs ever hear country differences.*

*That‚Äôs media politicians ever talking about: things separate us, things make us different one another. That‚Äôs way ruling class operates society: try divide rest people; keep lower middle classes fighting they, rich, run fucking money. Fairly simple thing... happens work. know, anything different, that‚Äôs they‚Äôre gonna talk about: race, religion, ethnic national background, jobs, income, education, social status, sexuality, anything keep us fighting keep going bank. know describe economic social classes country? upper class keeps money, pays none taxes. middle class pays taxes, work. poor scare shit middle class... keep showing jobs.‚Äù* testing even for? want anything. now. become curious place start. never happen pop media convinced look behind curtain Sweden's defense, herd immunity never strategy. interpreted way anti-lockdown types.

""In actuality, even use concept [of waves],"" ECDC spokesperson said. ""This something circulates media lot. refer current circumstances resurgence COVID-19 cases.""

Surely, mean **news-speak** newspeak. 

The obsession around waves ridiculous. actual spread matters. troll. Lol feel protesting? stay home well? interesting point time open restaurant. recommend good take menu. Good point I‚Äôm politicizing anything, personally. I‚Äôm speaking terms virus only, see it‚Äôs become political issue. Sad. That's thing this. brilliant smart. person, smart enough understand people spent lifetime working understanding exact scenario, MIGHT worth listening to... extent critical thinking required prevent hundreds thousands deaths, even that. deadly? unlikely deaths go 300k end year 400k end 2021. deadliest part over. Mmmmm dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è probably one reasons, also make easier separate people flocking around tables late hours. Glad they're this. safe protest there's pandemic going on. matter cause. must really self disciplined leave important medical appointments. groceries sent home, homeschool kids, work home. That‚Äôs fine, keep mask times don‚Äôt force people wear doesn‚Äôt effect. Illnesses among troops pretty awful. Dysentery diarrhea particular. bad gentleman's agreement sides shoot man pooping.  That's similar Ontario.

The Public Health Units found typical sitdown restaurant, covid cases happen staff staff (as go back, mingle without wearing masks) opposed staff customer transmission, since staff far likely wear masks dealing customers. use cases/1M population rather US equivalent? actually pretty interesting see extremely flawed point view. them, pandemic non-existent, overblown serious... ""like flu"", people die insignificant inevitable statistics like people die flu year. 

All countries world shut governments scam, citizens sheep know care freedom curtailed ""hoax"". Things getting complicated work interferes 14:00 updates :D luckily, always people stepping able post time. Seems nice update thread going everyone eager contribute there! great see (and lessens pressure hahaha) :D good news, come now. Prohibition touchy subject.

Good thing is, plenty people using covid reason finally kick habit. think 100k? already seeing cold season starting. Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings cause huge spread along regular indoor small gatherings throughout winter. think 100,000 people got protest Hollywood Blvd Los mask wearing probably 50%. Hard say exactly whenever saw closeup that. Downvotes people hard time tempering expectations saying loud makes people react. Didn‚Äôt know? r/Coronavirus. people sub get hard involves staying houses another 5 years. Dunning-kruger? IQ curve goes ways. spoke would removed unable duty country it‚Äôs citizens. right now

Been decades fam Thank pointing out. due respect admitted seat belt takes. Oh, mistaken, get MUCH worse. considered counseling? think could help you. proven way slowing spread Coronavirus. way us protect around us. Well fair flu vaccine dependent whether educated guess strain flu circulating correct. predict wrong strain vaccinate strain wide circulation effectiveness zero strains vaccine. it‚Äôs averages 50% can‚Äôt vary lot year year.

This case coronavirus stable quickly mutating away vaccine. issue effective immune response vaccine triggers. Unfortunately older weaker immune system less impact vaccine. older people, either need increase vaccine dose make vaccine provokes stronger immune response. However younger people vaccine may provoke immune response strong vaccine becomes possibly dangerous. That‚Äôs see different vaccines older people younger people minimum ages versions flu shot.

Here 50% probably individual variation person‚Äôs immune response provokes, long immunity lasts. However, even 50% may difference still catching coronavirus getting mild cold versus becoming catastrophically ill. people waking nonsense. Honestly good. Things like EU exists. Germany country capacity helping don‚Äôt  close barn door horses run free !!!!! looked many people get tested every day VS then? 

Yes, also noticed majority people tested back showing symptoms much likely infected, now, testing includes lot people show signs infection really even expected return positive test.

Here thought experiment explain it:

We population shapes, squares circles. shape could blue red. want remove red shapes keep blue shapes.

We check 100 shapes time initially check 50 squares 50 circles. find 10% squares red 50% circles red. gives us 5 red squares 25 red circles, meaning 30% checked shapes red.

We need efficient possible, hypothesize circles far likely red squares are. next round check 10 squares 90 circles. find 1 red square 45 red circles, meaning 46% checked shapes red. That's 50% increase number red shapes found, despite actual number red shapes population identical.

See works? That's testing April/May like. specifically targeted portion population likely infected thus much higher positive rate now.

Now let's say double amount shapes checked, go back checking two types equally. check 100 squares find 10 red ones. check 100 circles find 50 red ones. 200 shapes checked, find 60 red ones, bringing us back 30% red.

But balance different? checked 150 squares 50 circles - assuming actual numbers same, would find 15 red squares 25 red circles, total 40 red shapes (20% red).

That's less red shapes found, even though total number checks doubled actual number red shapes population remained unchanged.

That last example like happening now. Yes, testing far people, testing much greater proportion people unlikely infected versus number expected infected, reducing overall percentage positive tests, even actual number infected people remains same.

So, long story short, can't say ""oh tested fewer people really infected back then."" simply 1 1 comparison.  Much aggressive what? Ignoring telling people going around bend? sustained period 1000 deaths per day entering US would like word you.

Where get epidemiology degree? Trump University? 100% wrong. least power 2. Rule 6 really triggering OCD. Meanwhile 230,000 Americans quietly vacationing Aruba making sure never contact families friends, want mess Donald Trump. Even ones supporters must that. Seems plausible explanation me. seems funny idea Sweden one it. course Germany greater population take major cities Sweden (full people) consider example. Yes regretfully people die start balance deaths massive amount deaths would likely occur Swedish lockdown followed model European countries price utilitarian government would sadly rightfully pay. Now, I'm sure ideas lockdown, assume probably different ends spectrum. Getting back idea masks crucially main point made one rampant three year old killing millions wearing mask. Viruses course spread original host agree. consider long pandemic go on. Clearly think heard immunity good idea I'd imagine? (correct I'm wrong). two options may suggest would continual mask wearing (which huge psychological effect population particularly children, mention important factor plenty studies show masks unless worn absolutely correctly n95 type (I'm sure that's type correct I'm wrong, wear mask I'm sure brands types) best value worst, long term use cause health issues) waiting vaccine. waiting vaccine could waiting long time (not mention rushed could dangerous side effects). options please let know. crux problem strategy seems disingenuous me. Death rate among people age 40 1 1,000. lot orphans. aware cows. Biden starts national mask mandate, numbers go down, republicans unironically think "" 8 months climbing numbers *now* things getting better? Seems sus""  were, white house directed data go rather cdc. public report since August. try 3 minutes always work progress. originally started 30 seconds.

Everyone wants right, noone wants left. days ago saw video minor league conservative pundit (or comedian?) saying suspected prediction COVID-19 disappearing election day would wrong Democrats acquired much power maintaining existed. exactly insist COVID-19 hoax, rather response kind ongoing power grab designed oppress free people. got lucky. grew so-cal good schools that. middle school, friend moved Florida. stayed touch told dumb average person there. went C average student smartest kid class.

Covid organ damage thing, important thing. Learn it. Helmets also make difficult motorcyclists bicyclists look around see cars behind/beside seem fine that. study Australia looking protective headband protect head collision. I'm advocating helmets cars, think something people would fight claw tooth even could save lives can't really actively reduce risk dying car crash beyond getting car. accidents. could certainly reduce speeds 5 MPHs would absurd. Username checks out. Well quite little miracle? think spread virus. passing time see more, would liked. hope friends remain well. ah yes, \*checks watch\* right time... missed 8 months I'm sure people start taking seriously. can't set lockdown based false info/data. help conspiracy theories wrong time, lol. 45% immune, covid would need basic reproduction number least ~2 maintain *any* spread. low-density areas, that's pretty much non-starter community spread. high density areas, even basic measures (masks transit, lowered capacity restaurants) likely sufficient. keep lying it. CDC proved 130k reported deaths actually covid. Hard take things seriously know trying use covid advantage. Even AOC tweeted needed places stay shut hurt economy push Trump out. kind buffoonery takes place expect? They're still spreading it. majority AMERICANS

FIFY point trying make? think arguing wrong person now.

Whats argument? Prolly added /s it. Its. big fuking deal.

That means minimum 280k Americans dead. Thats nothing changes. get far grim. UK article.l, it‚Äôs almost certainly Oxford Pfizer. US Pfizer Moderna/NIH‚Äôs vaccine Oxford trial delayed.

Bitchmade managed perfectly fine Covid-19, what's changed? area, widespread support masks I've noticed many people using ""shields"" simply whatever want. ""We party, attend wedding, hang friends - wear masks okay!""

I've saying mask usage since day one! IIRC Scandinavian countries specifically said false sense security masks provide exactly want mask mandates. middle ground completely non-essential activities masks made-up position. meant make people *feel* safe. We're either pandemic severe non-essential activities must stopped masks required (and accept drawbacks come that), we're pandemic that's severe enough justify mask mandates business closures. hospitalizations? still up? way get zero people drive. complete nonsense commercial. point. said think safe year, throwing cold water take. know. also huge supporter military combat veteran myself. 

I oppose draft.

If war seems worth fighting politicians swivel-chairs don‚Äôt actually put skin game, raise army force, probably ain‚Äôt worth fighting.  Fuck no. They'd lose much money. someone running definitely inconvenient that's what's talked here.  


It' also absurd catching someone ran mask on. Stupid conversations like unfortunately give anti-mask people ammo talk wear masks situations appropriate. Even partially effective, helpful. mean insultingly. Please seek help. real person Completely randomly? got seat belt violation 16. Dude wanted fine something. seatbelt 2 seconds tops. straw man fallacy, political metaphor.

I never claimed masks primary reason virus spreading? actually making *another* straw man fallacy here, realize?

""People claiming ‚Äúscience‚Äù root reliance focus masks contradicting studies citing.""

Even links provide note masking better masks - primary concerns seem people may take false sense security stop social distancing additional protective measures. yes, links provided multiple single instances people experiencing complications, possibly mask-wearing - we'll admit that, people know mask without problems equally valid discussion points, right?   sustained thats 60kish deaths end year

In addition \~230k already dead \~300k excess deaths, yes. practically immune. death rate among children 1 100,000. ‚ÄúBuh buh buh wont wear mask private time??? Dont know PEOPLE DYING?!?!?‚Äù -you Here's why

Yeah, right. Let's dismantle bit - even comment vicious choice words, 670,000 samples frozen foods packaging tested COVID-19 Sept. 15. Reportedly, 22 positive 

So 1 30000 surface swabs. clear surface area swab covers.
But likely customer handling eating touch surface, perhaps two even three orders magnitude more.
How many frozen food items customer eat again, per ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs theoretically plausible, risk much lower established routes transmission virus

I conclude public data western countries, capable TTI stats. countries working TTI many called restrictions around food imports ‚Äúnot scientifically justified.‚Äù

Science says: 

- viruses, half-life saliva lab medium similar.
- Saliva concentration SARS-CoV-2 virus 10^11 per ml. Minimum infectious dose considered around 10^2 - might case aerosol infection, virus number per surface area.
- Half-life food conditions measured four weeks room temperature, many months refrigerator temperature, nearly indefinite freezer First, infected person would cough sneeze packaging.

Wrong. person would speak food, speaking creates large droplets, contains 10^5, 10^8 virus particles. Also, anyone worked food production know workers wipe noses bare hands. enough 10^9 virus particles, that's 10^7 times infectious Then, virus still active, someone else would need touch packaging touching eyes, nose mouth.

That's happens fresh produce consumed raw. Remember half-life?
And potential amount scale, one able mitigate household Sridhar HKU recommend widespread screening imported food items, likens ‚Äúlooking needle haystack.‚Äù

Yet, China finds needle needle. Also, NZ apply: Nearly supermarket produce homegrown, customs onward infected workers, low risk compared says China ‚Äúchosen monitor zero tolerance cases. you‚Äôre aiming zero, there‚Äôs different risk tolerance.‚Äù

That's survivors pay years world record-breaking shitshow ‚ÄúBy time food gets consumer stacked moved around enough see virus diluted unlikely adequate dose cause infection.‚Äù

What? effin stacking?

- read unfreezing violent thermodynamic event, virus can't survive. Yet, China demonstrated it.
- read virus surviving stomach acid. Yet, lab data showed nearly effect acids.
- read virus surviving 60 degrees Celsius. lab data showed survive many minutes, hours air contact.
- read saliva containing detrimental enzymes. Yet, viruses, saliva make much difference compared lab medium.

But main thing is: stacked moved around workers consumers. 

And shown food production mother hotspots.

If want treat consumers like babies, fine. enforce mask-wearing hand hygiene food production crime, however. ever was. Thinking lot Brazil. beautiful people. Hoping best country. hear you.

It talked much, i'd love see count total number flu vaccines administered point year compared last. 

I'd bet house 2x minimum hike prior years. 

Admittedly small sample size - work alone saw on-site (free), optional, flu vaccines jump 76 administered Oct. 2019 182 200 total on-site employees Oct. 2020. 

People simply want confusion. Regardless belief whole thing, people stepping getting flu vaccine help cross one possible way getting sick. get sick, work weeks forced get tested covid multiple times come back. 

So those, included, may simply passed flu shot past, eager step get it. 

This likely BIG determining factor number people sick flu season. least, IMO. hate fox news. sorry disease told correlation mandates death rates, increased suffering, want mandates. That's math im dead human. correction. see can.

Broken. Record. conspiracy oppress /s initial surge spring got parking ticket, parking have.

The protest masks made mesh fleece neck gaiters disperse virus exceptions ‚Äúanything better nothing‚Äù theory.

Old Navy sells packs 5 reusable masks $12.50. Pass on. mean ""no basis science""? Masks help stop spread corona. Wear fucking mask. Kroger Walmart 1am? still enough shoppers form checkout lines. sick winning yet? I'm rather skeptical Oxford get vaccine approved Christmas, [like says initially projected release date September, found out, *that* come fruition. naturally, I'm little wary dates put out. Besides, could even begin talk distribution even know Phase 3 trial results yet? irresponsible.

Also, [it look like going sort ""Christmas miracle"", It'll long time emergency use authorization vaccine, availability general public. Robert Redfield, director CDC, predicts [the latter even occur second half There's lot involved processes distribution, storage, vaccine injection might anticipated, too. process vaccinating enough people vaccine visible effect statistics take several months; ""one-and-done deal"" gets better January.

Additionally, vaccine mean stop taking precautions. especially true considering everybody willing take vaccine start, again, vaccination take bit time. important us forget vaccine meant supplement to, replacement mitigation measures, hand-washing, mask usage, social distancing, school closures, event cancellations, lockdown. Even second half 2021, realistic deadline release vaccine general public, keep implementing measures order prevent surges. 

I know might want hear, widely accepted scientific consensus. Many experts, [Dr. believe it'll time emergency use authorization vaccine (i.e. Oxford saying), release vaccine public, eventual far-off return ""normal"". even thinking [""going back get vaccine; instead, shift mentality little, focus maintain behavior adjust new reality world. talking guy morning. professional quality work house work weekends. incredible house way less would bought done.

Again, conversation hijacked someone idea they're talking about. No, cannot transmit virus outdoor areas passing someone.

Maybe read article? apparently read headline. Malls never excluded, least country (Brazil) closed quarantine functioning 50% capacity, crowded neither weekends anymore.

About public transport, excluded, countries (like mine, Brazil) requires mask usage public transport, enter it.

The problem is: can't use mask time restaurants, churchs (praying loudly, eating wine bread, everyone touching everyone sessions) new testing criteria like less testing spring. know critical cases lining hospital. Every sick person shall ""self isolate"" home tough out. shall see doctor, too. right trying set example. main point being, *tons* nuances could lead results useful tried capture simple example.

the strongest point theory fact catching ""asymptomatic"" positive cases. actually fairly decent evidence results indeed meaningful good. regardless, repeated bulletproof data collection process. already know train model literally need new dataset nobody speculate.

super exciting result regardless. even worst case much identifying sick people (im sure bad), still fairly cool able tell sick forced cough! adoption ml uses like exciting Massachusetts, churches phase 1 openings.

Baker fraud. He's lucky he's northeast people close NY NJ educated people wear masks socially distance regardless.

It actually straight sucks. Fuck noise problem state responsible health, state pay unemployment state sponsored business assistance. federal government help, won't, states fight virus. 

No one, even federal government money make lost profits etc. offer aid programs.

Yet states alone responsible keeping virus hospitals functioning.

Unfortunately, took wrong turn. Article unclear requirements were, prior order. way worded, think might meant already mask mandate, expanded public places, including outdoor areas. obvious. Please share. people claiming financial burden follow mask law people cannot afford mask, it‚Äôs question infection. It‚Äôs covering face legally outside. post removed used political keywords. I'll try again.

There instances US unconfirmed stories discussions also happening New Zealand Canada. see first there‚Äôs erosion rule law due process, paramilitary action, state emergency, et cetera.

Exactly. That's everything we're seeing. Measures previously thought unthinkable, unseen even wartime, effect across Europe (house arrests, curfews, travel prohibitions, etc.). muzzIes small, symbolic measure part bigger whole. 

I live Europe, still collective memory tyranny. prize liberty eternal vigilance, please keep mind. Cheers mate. lot rules pointless. obvious example.

If Clinton president, would hyped-up vaccine talk pressure make absurd promises rapid outcomes vaccines generally require years develop. nations would feel need compete US acquire vaccine.

I know want believe magic bullets yourself. allowed orange one fool thinking developing vaccine easy making sandwich. ‚ÄúBut, many died‚Äù asks every conservative, anti-science, cultist U.S.

As someone raised conservative, found Christianity early 20‚Äôs said, ‚Äúwow Jesus actually gives fuck people,‚Äù Conservative Christians make sick stomach. aren‚Äôt closing schools contact tracing. They‚Äôve upped exposure 60 minutes. Classes 39. 40 minutes, supposed get mask break. county give test breakdowns. get limited information. suburban schools open, city still closed. We‚Äôve rising since September schools opened though. Yikes.  Far tell, Boris get take someone corrupt Trump, give slightly better brain.

No one gonna fine wearing mask alone because... shocker... there's one there, one see wearing it. Germany also taking patients Netherlands. opinion, shows unity EU good friendship neighbours. think grasping straws here.  Honestly, lots ""tips"" voters control.

Until admin office, nation wide effort make sure people mask on, make sure people given enough space indoors. 2 9/11s per week fyi flU... noticed too. Probably also helps I'm around people less considering used go movie theater every week. Mandatory indoor mask wearing. large gatherings enforced fines. Coronavirus spreading cause people park wearing mask 5ft instead 6ft. 10ft apart. guy sitting park themselves. spread restraunts home family member family member small gatherings friends. Nah live Cape almost do. One guy town never rest been. see details masks can‚Äôt say beyond that. Even go daily walks almost every single person mask. Last time ONE person didn‚Äôt.

Also started low case load isolated island (albeit large one). different scenario entirely what's occurring Europe US legitimately believe Ron DeSantis care Floridians live die.

I move heaven earth get man tossed office 2022. send link science? bit misleading would better served % population.

Also, missing entire lot American plagues lost something like 90% population disease immunity Europe. lol simmilar thought recently first misinformation going skip final testing phase. *in* testing phase, there's misinformation (or misconceptions) already launched working. misspelled Sturgis science says little zero viral transmission outside, particularly socially distanced.

So actually anti-science. Preventing bacterial pneumonia. large increase Covid-19 cases seen Europe started later Sweden. spread typically begins younger age groups hits older age groups higher risk getting sick. matter time I'm afraid hope turn around.

Also, Stockholm region 10% hospitalized patients Covid-19 ICU. Assuming decent social distance it‚Äôs okay people don‚Äôt spend day crowd it‚Äôs long line workers need good masks sanitizer knew someone White House pass message! Preferably Dr. task force?!

Why assume that? No.

I mean, anything possible, course, I've seen, medical community pharmaceutical companies done pretty good job resisting political pressure rush vaccine. Trump administration officially declared ending Corona accomplishment guys imagining things. #MAGA2020 vaccine question need stored temperatures. One lead scientists Astra Zenica quoted interview yesterday 10 vaccines entering final trials right different companies around world would ready mid-December. 

Astra Zenica already begun production 3 billion doses ready Jan 1 cost 2 euro per dose. Hopefully pass final trials. companies take months ramp production, decent supply available around world various vaccines early mid 2021. 

Pretty much story I've hearing since summer. Timelines accurately estimated seem going according plan. many failsafes works (so many different vaccines developed once), likely options end final trials. Oh makes sense, should‚Äôve read Haha, it‚Äôs good time post pandemic world. Great evening games drinks friends. Highly recommend shit ends trip well worth haha Ain't convenient two kinda go hand hand hope too. horrible environment. eliminated decades ago. people live together close contact extremely long periods time mask usage fail foolproof way stop transmission, especially without better cloth masks. matrix worth mandate case. TRUE OUTDOOR EXPOSURE.  damage smell taste ain't permanent, many recovered too. There's also reason bring 2 year old close strangers. people kid, dislike social distancing. \*deep voice\* uh faaaaaair think less ignorance time goes on. us living urban areas, exposure virus impacts almost immediate. suburban rural areas seeing upticks infections, there‚Äôs going lot anger misinformation passed around. 

People never good emphasizing tragedies others experience tragedy themselves, know. Sad say might leads acknowledgment situation. thought recently bumped 60%? Actually, lot hospitals operate near capacity time. Yeah legitimately looney tunes mate argument Disney World profitable right now; theme parks going big driver. funny, either say stats true, true carry humanity behind brush deaths 'dont know them'. though need know name someone show compassion. 

I've two family members (unrelated) die it. One alone care home, outbreak. said she'd fine turned corner hard. alone hospital bed. something else life threatening caught covid stay. died less week later. Neither kids got say good bye quarantine limitations. 

And also friend who's late twenties who's knocked ass it, blood clotting medication get checked monthly constantly clotting really know treat it. 

It's utterly unfair someone ask 'do even know anyone who's it?' 1,000 people roughly many people went high-school, easy number picture impact of. One high-school's worth people every day. 

Just mind-numbingly sad. none, going continue play course 3 waves like viruses history have. going set well, believe numbers. would anyone bash daring question we're told? people behind numbers honorable? way. information, please. one else little worried it‚Äôll rushed potentially side effects? estimated 617,877 851,066 people died four year time span.

Edit:
Here's link article. article link study Keep mind using relatively balanced design evaluate models (equal parts positive negative cases). reality (knock wood), active COVID infections less 10% population. result, even relatively high performance statistics result large errors (false positives) highly imbalanced real world setting.

See paper liked context. true. correct example. recognize younger self too. Care explain missing explanation (for somebody low opinion deflection certainly seem fond it)?

Your generic objection seems apply making people wearing masks outside reasonable expectation running others well, course I'm kind guessing since really explain objection all. need citation fact children spread virus aswell? Damn least hoping you‚Äôd clever comeback. Oh well, it‚Äôs probably first time left someone disappointed I'd like keep way please. comment explaining young university students afraid virus. statement true, though. 20 somethings particular risk getting seriously ill. afraid, really care getting infected. No, business costs, leasing building, go away business forced close temporarily. 50% time, works every time. Hospitals weren‚Äôt filling pre-covid. even close. Send cyber space force elite fighters!! people wonder blame Trump want fix mess created. Instead, White House gives up. know Trump never get serious masks covid protocols. Pelosi cackles made comment intrusive government surveillance indicting countries like South Korea. white guilt noted, spared next riots comrade! Say dude: ""P v y""

It really helps, trust me. bother people care. People want open up. understand extreme economical price shutting gonna be. vaccine reduce lethality severity symptoms (and turn need hospitalization), dramatically improve things, particularly at-risk groups. Well parents open restaurant soon. one hand hope goes well cause lots outside patio seating, increasing cases dimming hopes. need know long virus contagious surfaces different temperatures. say low risk can't tell low. chemistry major gives absolutely zero authority speak public health measures know right? happens give incentive people visit infected areas? human nature social people tired isolated think going happen them. hard air born particles accumulate outdoor setting air moved around dispersed.  Inside air particles recirculated around whole space trapped inside. Talking depth here... overreaction cause Cytokine storm ? far I‚Äôve heard, tickets empty threat. far penalty goes, you‚Äôd check Governor Baker. Government coffers still fund things like education health care. course, also fund things like private helicopters fancy dinners I, unemployed citizen, clue breakdown is. I‚Äôm happy live state providing survival right don‚Äôt care money tickets lottery taxes. I‚Äôm grateful it. bring close strangers. Problem solved. choices mutually exclusive. somewhat effective vaccines available early next year (and they're proven safe, course), get those. better vaccines come year two later, also get those.

Unless, course, adverse reactions two. sure testing that. South America 80% fewer flu cases year thanks lockdowns, mask wearing, social distancing hand washing. Let's hope North America say flu season progresses. noticed US hit one wave travelling states time? means average US always lower states wave currently generating cases. 

Comparing infection rate US individual European countries cheap trick make US look better is.  love american imperial mathematical system, x(9/11)=total covid deaths Maybe. Nobody actually knows Trump's EO enforceable. They'd also officially move position class ""F"", take quite time paperwork. people know still working Feds, nothing come EO absolutely guidance given it.

Even NOAA chief scientist reported fired actually fired; removed chief scientist. He's actually still working NOAA. problem people taking risks spread covid conservative people. making decisions others. linked irrelevant study. I'm speaking reusable masks able washed uses. surgical masks disposed of.  Reusable masks sanitized daily.

Yes people use shirt sleeves, neck gaiters, coffee filters, material masks. Anything prevents spitting droplets air goal. Human behavior also factor science mask usage. People robots. Thats difference science bullshit. Science actually looks data, bullshit think case. Ah, true man education culture see. I've never Dave Busters made want watch Always Sunny episode. Alright Mr.Chemistry major, whats big solution then? husband worn exercising. 
This past summer, menopausal women, soaked mine water run acted air conditioning plus think, caught droplets. husband wears top head keep sweat eyes mouth &amp; nose. 1000% agree video. Probably first time I‚Äôve seen accurate timelines shared mainstream media. timelines fit everything see happening, seeing things mapping out.

Agreed Thanksgiving things going nuts many areas December far worse. extend tougher months January February noticeable shift cases direction. see daily death count MUCH higher nationwide Jan Feb massive spike cases Dec. (See current spike UK graph see coming US weeks.)

Agreed entire US won‚Äôt shut down, certainly see areas/counties choice lockdown. many across US question. even bigger question, many actually quickly enough save lives. reactive vs proactive costs lives detrimental affects local economy.

No idea many people watch CNBC follow Dr. good job video helping struggle mentally prepare coming winter months. wish really hit wearing masks hard ‚Äî showed everyone proper way wear one... also covering damn nose! [There superspreader events ventilation might better help mitigate spread.

Malls might less likely superspreader events right now, since typically mask policies, people linger talk way restaurants. This. Plenty states mandates still seeing spikes due lax enforcement. Ugh that's awful. husband got asked ID polling place last year. like ""what?"" another poll worker like ""you can't ask em ID!"" like ""oh..."" fucking idiots.

::facepalm:: good? hospitals overloaded? not, good. good friend who‚Äôs surgical assistant yep. telling doctors/surgeons absolutely, ‚Äúpush‚Äù per say, definitely talk-up surgeries immediately necessary actually true. 
Kinda blew mind little bit. That's said. comment implied generally lack science within mask wearing. I'm arguing wearing mask areas nobody else around. Would still encourage case? Sure, never hurts safe, mask wearing works help social distancing. try twist I'm saying saying. People populations like Boston need enforcement, absolutely agree increasing distancing restaurants. I'm grocery store older man approaches mask talk something nothing important like meat, want stricter measures others stay away me. ...which probably extensive tests trials kind thing. Wont fuck shit since large part damage done Cytokine storm? Bullshit know it. know fact amount testing drops every weekend.

Friday 4000. Saturday nearly 3000, figure Monday drastically increased tomorrows report. 

It happens every week. u dumber smarter think are. cite high school example #1. make piece shit?

In minds certain people thread, does. science support wearing mask home.

Really? Let's walk it:

1) Wearing mask reduces chance infect people near you.

2) home, assuming live alone, near people also live there.

3) Thus, wear mask home less likely infect people home.

What track understanding science? One seeks enlightenment They‚Äôre taking Belgium, Spain, etc filling German icus  Also planes get 100% new air every minutes. Here, get started. Let know ready already anticipating wanting type everything believe. videos hours long typing things make sense.

""Youtube source"" sure next response I'll ask research discredit claims find fact true cool story, really seeing it‚Äôs relevant here. 
I agree everyone doesn‚Äôt need go bars restaurants, renters can‚Äôt really entertain renovations everyone position buy property That‚Äôs 2 9/11 week  No, people protesting care mask wearing public health, lol.

And people protesting masks, don't. equivalency homeslice, sophistry aside. Sources numbers? would think 7 months, would built temporary hospitals possible surge are. think 100k?

Wishful thinking, others. ridiculous, absolutely FOOLISH, think rounding bend 100K peak, happened days ago. Mind-numbingly ignorant. think people buy covid doom gloom. used one guys. People stupid, large. culture tolerates, many cases glamorizes willful ignorance. People better, reason to. It‚Äôs semantics, know. words matter. 

Sorry? word matter? encountering ‚Äúwave‚Äù, it‚Äôs force nature, something hits without able affect yourself. like using artificial methods reduce intensity waves long time... Cautiously optimistic, sounds like great news! leading candidates said giving bar significantly 50%. I'm crossing fingers 75-80% would really surprised turns fall 60/65%. According logic already well 2,000,000+ reported Covid deaths. every hospital doctor wants inflate numbers, low? Clearly they‚Äôre reporting deaths Covid, right? 

And chose completely ignore ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù response that. Yeah agree. Germany spearheading unity union. 100,000 new cases per day peak think US see.

Ignorance bliss, eh friend? heard shit before... Oh, yeah, White House. LMAO, dude. L.M.A.O.  Since testing limited spring due lack testing equipment people sick enough corona need go hospital got tested.

Meaning tests would probably long story short, can't say ""oh tested fewer people really infected back then."" simply 1 1 comparison.

Now kiwi wants forget testing sick enough go hospital means find tiny minority get sick enough go hospital.

So 1000 day spring found. Many 1000 ill enough need visit hospital. consider many assymptomatic mild symptoms staid home caugh.

You realize 1000 day tiny fraction true number. (FHM estimate number 10-15 times more)

No blue balls needed calculation. Wow really haha notice  Remember ""bigly"" dumbest thing Trump did? days.  Tell countries like India Brazil. Indeed! watch it. predict week never rise 110k new cases. even giving lot breathing room there. think begin howering around 80-100k several weeks. ‚ÄúImagine stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.‚Äù 

-George Carlin numbers since Friday quite bit lower initially forecast. Whether that's R down, backlog testing, Reformation Day yet clear. think need wait next weekend really see situation, make conclusions R trump wins election fires them. Americans reap sown coming months. experience profit margins restaurants high all. operate insanely thin margins time. chump said easter!!! Everything kind nonsense astoundingly stupid. 

Do people *any* idea much money hospitals medical offices losing pandemic? reality money treating COVID patients balances money lost elective surgeries routine visits 6 months. 

They're desperate. dentist primary care physician sending letters practically begging schedule appointment. give two weeks I'm going get letter like ""We swear god come physical let us bill insurance straight blow you. take-backs. Dead serious. Please. need money."" Sorry meant France. Thx catching that. Math hard, der. nearly extent happen symptoms, adults. Still, would prudent keep away elderly relatives, extra precaution. Yes. remain one zone. 
Yet florida, texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama imploded summer. 
It contradicts many indicators low humidity, lack vitamin people indoors. would assume it‚Äôs logistically harder trace. restaurant may records everyone certain time, reservations credit cards. church records members way contact everyone. think trying reach everyone random subway car mall. way would put something news, don‚Äôt think health departments that.

Remember two years ago scary caravan migrants coming invade attack U.S. magically disappeared northern Mexico day elections?

They're projecting. Again. Exponential growth starts slow something hits fan. not? Curious insight.

Winter seem backstops Summer had, along 3 biggest holidays year 4 weeks apart. cannot possibly upvote enough! people always comapare non contagious, hard prevent deaths accidents something could easily prevent needless deaths. hear pressure gets far-righters UK. like States. Many ignorant people also loud rich, unfortunately. don‚Äôt read articles. Hope Steffo well, we've already lost one great media personality virus! user spreading mis-information whatever reason. Schools based data provided government responsible double outbreaks bars/restaurants/ unfortunately, stage pandemic there's money support businesses, let alone individual shift workers slave away establishments. Health city leaders shut unless region's ICU's get impacted. 

So really warning &amp; every one us. take responsibility health &amp; safety. want catch covid, need minimize risks own. one save yourself. Yes, precisely. That's loophole needs closed. People claim get closer 6ft somebody get closer that. claim 6ft away, unless video every single person see go out, word claim got close without mask on. mandate masks times public even outside, mandate becomes enforceable person longer lie proximity others, required wear mask without ambiguous distance related excuses made. either put mask, stay home. Please make unfounded personal attacks asking question. article nothing refugees it, read it. 

Are lot refugees Belgium getting COVID? mostly citizens? Ivermectin relatively safe, even high clinical doses. Sold stromectin, FDA approved generic, hence big pharma money behind trials. Didier Raoult hype machine drove many early studies hydroxychloroquine.

There relatively randomized controlled trials date. knowledge they're running 2 favor, 1 against. bad math think that‚Äôs like 1 person every 2 minutes. 

(1,000 / 24) / 60 = 0.69 (people per minute) Letting days go by... concerned weekend. basically ignore weekend numbers. Monday 90k. capacity testing new people available infect 100k new cases day. see ceiling there. probably. expect good chunk resistance sadly. Sweden. deadliest cases seem public exposure, bringing virus home, exponentially increasing viral load small space unknowingly. complete misrepresentation data... even look it, spewing whatever BS get across Bias..

Schools single handedly biggest sector ranging 10% (outlier) 20-22-39% outbreaks.

Gyms bars across regions accounted 11%-7%-17%-7% 

Less half see schools. Sad got 27 upvotes spewing governor announced it.  Today best day since meeting gf happens. proof exist. background epidemiology. literally throwing things random.

I could say ""it's unlikely US covid deaths 15 million March"" much backing said. Well, come back say ""I told so"" happens, think we're going see daily numbers 3,000 deaths Highlights:

- we‚Äôre surrounded people behave certain way likely behave way.

- People underestimate risk based personal experiences...The pandemic beyond limits human intuition...Somebody needs protect you.

- official communicators dropped ball, **undermined people don‚Äôt public‚Äôs interest heart**.

- Optimism bias pattern thinking causes brains see future outcomes rosier really are...‚ÄúUntil hear message somebody position authority tendency really want believe it. People don‚Äôt want believe really bad news.‚Äù

- Hospital CEOs would convinced dire threat posed pandemic federal government decided say something. much time lost.

- public health officials sound early alarm, voices squelched. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, one senior leaders CDC, warned Feb. 25 would community spread virus, protective measures might include school closures working home. ProPublica previously reported, comments caused stock market drop, infuriated Trump. Vice President Mike Pence installed communicator-in-chief, CDC officials sidelined. **‚ÄúWhen mattered most, shut us up,‚Äù** senior CDC official told ProPublica. infection School, possible contacts known. stopped spreading.

While sitting indoor dining, supposed gap next table (here) supposed leave name contact data.

Outdoors may walk without handing card everybody.

I've seen examples contact tracing blame airflow indoor ventilation spreading virus. That's 9/11 every days, what's problem that? 6k number one see everything eases opens up. Even trump back office, that's gonna happen. Actual projection shows stay 2.5k, masks course even lower.

New cases 100k estimation based testing capacity basic immunity presence population. pandemic lasts, people getting virus getting it, grants immunity winter months. virus run new people infect time goes by. stop, hitting ceiling 100-110k new cases day, sure. want catch coro- na- virus

But stupid general word. People starting appreciate staggering percentage people bereft character critical thinking.   Get better fitting masks. Mine fine. need close seal along whole top edge.

The definition safety multiple choices, one presents less risk, take option.  


Between distance learning, class schools, presents less risk? Dude understand saying per capita. 

I know guy, what. personally live state see morons every day. So, please tell random study validation results apply life. tell plenty willfully ignorant people wont think others unless they're forced.

Massachusetts state almost 600% covid cases since mid-July personally idgaf makes required everywhere outside. Clearly people fucking up. problem many ""elective"" surgeries needed avoid larger medical problems line. got away spring canceled weeks (I assume) rushed get done summer. hospital capacity months time going pile cause dreaded collateral deaths: potentially around number hospitalizion covid patients would actually save. 

I used think suppression answer, become clear that's probably impossible winter. Upping hospital capacity dramatically (10-fold least), locking summer (or enough vaccine doses), full elimination, millions deaths due unavailable medical systems months appear options. key words 'confirmed cases'. extremely difficult expensive confirm reinfection cases.

Um. not. live place decent level testing and/or contact tracing, would fairly simple. know, computers.

We're talking complex DNA comparisons anything. simple ""looks like we've sir, tested positive, negative, positive again. Let's double check is, absolutely idea many unconfirmed reinfection cases floating around there.

AGREED, know many initial covid cases first place. least know whole lot those. CANNOT said reinfection claiming 'rare'. ONE knows common reinfections are.  claim rare either propagandists, clue talking about.

Things general rare evidence points existence lot them. theorize want it, call people propagandists prove wrong. guy replied definitively said ""immunity temporary"" little evidence support people (or even many all). Would consider propaganda and/or lack clue?

Also, note said ""STILL rare"" comment above. Covid back March, course I'm worried reinfection. worried seasonality virus, worried immunity fading, also comforted fact severe lack EXISTING EVIDENCE happening far points possibility reinfection time soon low. Period.

I'll sure let know get again. Yup conveniently deleted, unfortunate situation reddit nowadays yep read days ago....fake news indeed.  Birx warned us Aug 2 would rural, widespread, brutal.  Trump basically said fool sidelined her.  would time would needed shift rhetoric encourage Americans base steel resolve.  Covid seeded way I‚Äôm concerned worse Europe 3-4 weeks behind without mitigation strategy renewed commitment keep things chugging along. problem masks mask mandates = big events still shutdown. mean could big events, bars, restaurants, etc.. open masks, know that's worthless..

This help daily life eventually.
Also paying attention deep breathing day good practice self awareness. Watch many times lose forget watch breath.

I hope come like high minded know all. Hopefully advice helps self work. 

This one hardest things human tackle....its nice get hand sometimes someone done first steps. help you.... help next one. depends person seeks help one, or, already treatment listens follows therapist/psycho doc, would imagine. really hard.

I mean, looking practically, seem hard. lot people really like wearing mask time, whether view stupid mentality not, seem reality. reality, focus efforts count, new mandate change mask rules erodes compliance political bit bit. fairly certain going sort ""sustained death number"". anything, going REALLY shit time terms COVID overall, basically told worse case scenario here, would expect death count react accordingly.

Edit: could wrong, information gathered personally. Well course. wasn‚Äôt big deal big strong spray tan boy. given experimental drugs best doctors world expense. seriously better think whether fabric rating. look good me. South Koreans enjoyed way freedom Europeans entire duration pandemic. draconian lockdown practiced Wuhan copied many countries Europe representative police state. no, government doesn‚Äôt rely censorship stop hoaxes spreading; massive religious anti-lockdown protest Seoul could shut judge ruled it. That‚Äôs police state. use credit card phone gps data contact tracing put place SARS; nothing North Korea, use often would think. experiencing amount deaths every 3 days Covid experienced 9/11 people still want downplay virus. 3 weeks ago, cases constant decline 3 months nearing lowest since April. Hospitalizations still flat (though seeing slight uptick now) deaths still down. Granted last 2 start increase cases risking. yeah, think ‚Äúnow‚Äù acceptable term. DeSantis Florida handling poorly, last several months state average compared nation terms cases per population. coronavirus disease literally got hit face little airplane people would gotten shit together day 1.

It's invisible people directly affected. Someone gets sick kinda disappear. Sometimes come back, sometimes don't. yeah cause tomorrow might confusion said healthcare workers wear masks. people know small virus laughable contain non medical masks wear hours time. work bunch people believe this.

There currently two vaccines prepared, one requiring two shots needing kept minus 70 degrees.

Alongside GPs PCNs, teams delivering care homes, at-scale delivery centres.

Pulse understands sufficient resources allocated practices.

A number sources confirmed Pulse announcement around DES imminent, potentially next week.

It expected vaccines delivered number ways, teams going care homes delivery centres, reported the¬†Economist¬†and the¬†Sun.

Pulse reported last month NHS looking start rollout vaccine December, sources close issue putting chances ‚Äô50/50‚Ä≤.

More people MAY get sick, MAY get sicker time. see. major epidemics done. completely different disease 100 years scientific advancement lean on? Thats 9/11 every 3 days folks, context  good math you? Let explain simply. US annual death rate population growth currently 1%, make easy let's assume 1%. means year 3 million would added population, resulted 30k deaths, 300k deaths.

Really seems like carefree summer everyone forgot COVID Europe really coming back vengeance now. 

&amp;#x200B;

As American, fuck ups always pretty predictable. definitely thought Europe would know better...also considering people spending summer kind making fun us. Absolutely, referring slower pace increase seen since Friday (on average around +35-40% vs last week, week around 40-50%) November 4th Australia already pretty much vanished here. must correct. like 1/12th heart disease. It‚Äôs annoying. blew two months life sick Covid. I‚Äôm still 100%. Part feels little ashamed that. possibly permanent lung damage...from fake virus? I‚Äôm thin, active, don‚Äôt smoke, etc etc. don‚Äôt wanna wish badly people, get equivalent cold, isn‚Äôt super fair. sure didn‚Äôt get cool ass drugs like FatAss Chief did. 

Side note though: anyone gets badly, fever nuts. wish video hearing stuff wasn‚Äôt there. family yelling door hallucinating again. Hahaha. Fun times. Um... we've already given up.. long time ago. They've decades. site ""Talking Points Memo"" originally created order track ""talking points"" right wing would send left could keep top derp. 

It's scary, nothing new. health officials yet release daily pandemic data report 2 p.m., three hours past usual time information goes public.

Florida *Florida things* data again. Must liked numbers saw. sorry hear illness. husband tested positive last week. conditions led us believe getting COVID would mean big trouble. far, hasn't. very, unpleasant illness. Friday thought would shaken end weekend. 

Saturday woke symptoms started with: unbelievable fatigue, joint pain, headache, dry cough. fever time. feel bad today point since started. frankly shocked battering usually good morale taking. 

It saddens red 'moral distress'. Five years ago working post-retirement providing pro-bono representation people foreclosed upon illegally. developed devastating illness very, lucky survive. Unfortunately, unscathed. memory issues would make difficult ethically impossible practice law. Literally five minutes saw reply, read case indigent person needs lawyer. actually remind can't me.

I worked several cases past years. offered services unpaid 'advisor' newly qualified attorneys. would love new case, cannot. now, physical energy mental focus. 

What counted easily gets counted. pandemic, means get body counts, number infections, hospitalizations, ICU utilization, etc. hear little, anything, careers derailed, jobs lost, financial problems caused, grief experienced, etc country's failure deal pandemic causing. wish best. Said someone clearly unstable. observed partisan differences distancing associated subsequently higher COVID-19 infection fatality growth rates pro-Trump counties. Taken together, data suggest US citizens‚Äô responses COVID-19 subject deep‚Äîand consequential‚Äîpartisan divide.

The saddest part partisan leaders could saved lives simply encouraging prosocial behavior constituents. medical field? Likely due duration spend closed areas stagnant. broken record. never said funny. rhetorical definitely.  exponential growths eventually stop? misinformation report right? Fuck off. guy left work covid test. There's people hospital me. stressful. dont need shit too. dunno. saw customer pick effing nose public yesterday. That's disgusting without pandemic going on.  joke funnier time repeat  say so, apparently cold weather makes thr virus transmissable, so....start engines. Well problem things like sat act sports still going. parents want kids get scholarships (understandably), realize could getting people sick. deaths lag cases several month revisit it.

There many places world hasnt happened, people keep saying like law nature. One problems people brainwashed believe world divided ""the good"" ""the bad"". such, come across something first try figure thing belongs bad camp good camp.

Plus honestly think many people really care country gets fucked over, long liberals get fucked too. right (in country also elsewhere) nothing promise people ""We good guys, bad guys"". Instead plans, point perceived bad things bad guys that's it. That's fans need. Similar dynamics cult. Unbelievable happened Imperial/Ferguson model behind first lockdown shown ridiculous well. Doubt it. We've hearing vaccines year. Dead men arent cult members. 

Also, think stop judging people like child would without facts back up. 

Makes look...infantile... knee-jerk reaction. money driven, endanger people's lives, support idea people distrust experts daily basis. Distrusting experts say, part culture. Masks indoors mandatory, street densely populated areas.

But taking 3 mile walk run outside golf course ridiculous,.... data support it. solution zero risk. I'd rather children safe access normal environment decrease slightly risk people able take care themselves.

Have idea many underprivileged children adequate conditions distant learning, dependent school meals, need extra attention school professionals? right mind deprive children marginally minimize risk people socialize kids right anyway? adverbs necessary? Frantically? Come on...

I wipe certain things delivered. read much virus surfaces. try read everything get hands learn virus. result, things wipe down, don't. Plastic? wipe down. Aluminum? I'll wipe I'm going handle next hours. Cardboard derivatives? let sit day so, bother wipe (or, unpack whatever's inside, take poke hand sanitizer wash hands.)

It's fearful, let alone frantic. knowing close zero chance still greater zero. What's wrong someone reduce chance even further?

I absolutely understand likelihood transmission surface contact extremely low. Probably, everything wipe perfectly fine efforts unnecessary. also know would suck ass catch virus, suck even caught unknowingly passed 76 yo mother visit. sort thing want leave chance, even chance stupidly low.

Does make person frantic? Things like clubs sporting event idea. I'm talking travel. REALLLLY WANT GO TRIP RELAX lol Anyone that's paying attention since March sadly knows ugly truth... simply takes control spread. 

Instead unifying event rallied together fight against, make small sacrifices protect vulnerable... became divisive event. 'us', 'me'. showed truly selfish self centered really are.* 

*Yes, people get defensive, say 'Not me, everything right stayed home since 1912""... know 'everyone'. far, way many. alllll 1 family lol Daycare public. take good precautions. Daycare necessary. 

It begs question can't groceries time. also wonder can't drop friends family, can't run errands daycare. long take you? often? Sounds like 3 hours day. Seems like inefficient it.

Be may, really wonder can't get 2 year old wear mask. reject pants shoes aswell? Must real problem child. lot kids enjoy wearing masks. rarely ever witnessed kid rejecting clothing items. Although happen, lot upbringing. 

Aaanyways, realize fishing excuses ease conscience. help that. understood correctly, way change law case requires passed accepted two different parliaments (so one one new elections). Dunning-Kruger Effect: Probably lot folks sub seem want masks distancing rest lives ‚Äúportrait‚Äù somewhere?

I‚Äôll bet makes Dorian Grey's look like Mona Lisa Math hard middle school dropouts. seriousness people generally idea exponential growth works. clearly magic therefor valid. entirely sure tbh around 31,000 hospital first wave. according news article 58% ICU occupied covid  imagine real chance hospitals could become overwhelmed let's say positive nasal swab March, negative April, positive October. Reinfection not?

Personally, would count reinfection. However, considered confirmed case variants virus sequenced. technically, No, would considered reinfection probably ignore massive amount it, seen yet. Sources?

If 'news' reports reinfections far back would suggest hop ole search engine start searchin. I'm sure find numerous articles similar [this really care understand topic, would suggest actually research topic yourself. 

In honesty, would've done homework begin with, claiming reinfections rare, conversation. Brought part by: white conservatives Southern Strategy. Call dr asap &amp; feel bad get hospital. well~ one greatly helped us get position. US see happens actually overwhelmed healthcare system. January NYC called extra nurses around country, June, Texas Florida pulled traveling nurses, 37 states careening towards maxed hospitals, don‚Äôt cavalry like save lives before. also send spot check hypocrisy. :) OWNED facts spelling. Schools opened  Probs meant $800 every 1 2 weeks depending family size? We're disappointed waste time well So, could cite source numbers? I'd love see numbers back up. I've seen far 200,000 dead US, nowhere near entirety Europe. I'm wrong, I'd like know. left Benghazi, otherwise, bra-vo! well &amp; safe &amp; stay busy~ hold onto butts Especially Belgium hospital beds per habitant Germany. know that, according CDC, October 3rd, 300000 people died compared time 2019

No that's thy calculate that.

They look last 5 years average it.

The problem is, people dying year population growth demographics, (if number constantly growing), averaging past 5 years *always* going give number low. Lol. Yeah, that's revolt, hell Americans called lmao? Wearing mask pandemic common sense. don‚Äôt need scientific evidence though plenty. cough sneeze tissue throw away wearing mask like thicker durable tissue covering cough sneezes keep virus escaping. Belgium Czech Republic. Plus paying costs pandemic Europe... We've become mentally weak people (maybe we've always been, never tested). Hmm... never boarded people Japan, South Korea, Singapore... yes China. main difference COMPLIANCE citizens listen health officials. Whether masks staying home. 

You think ever happen here? don‚Äôt. People fight told being. thing seat belts motorcycle helmets. FFS pandemic 2022 non-compliance nonsense. tool. I‚Äôm making decisions myself. one trying get government make decisions me. Fuck right farts bad enough pilot reverse flow hepa filters also. hate point out, least four examples negated instead argument ""Doing way save us money pass back along investors.""

**That's point.** People disagree experts say, experts correct (or, experts correct employee). Disagreeing experts experts right: people do. case comes fearing understand.

This comment, previous one, come across insults. disagree tone also idea. think people scared understand. think people bother learning things care about. lack knowledge suggests apathy, fear. 

People chose leaders believe help them, financially, socially, culturally; reject leaders help harm them. trust people help them, people like them. two people vying someone's team captain, new supervisor, congressman, better new leader person likes them. 

They better listening medical expert seems like them, people care. People want bedside manner. People instinctively support person seems support them, person seems support them, even apparently-supportive person gives dangerous advice. 

In words: people trust ""experts"" pander seem like helpful, even ""real"" ""good"" experts. Dr. Phil real doctor, demeanor extensive editing TV show made seem like trustworthy. Neil deGrasse Tyson smarter scientists great stage presence seems approachable, become popular. That‚Äôs happens 2 wheels go one way 2 wheels go opposite direction. either go nowhere keep spinning around you‚Äôre confused discombobulated. think America we‚Äôre discombobulated stage  bar/club bouncers checking that?

Don't get wrong, I'm this, trying understand works.

That said, vaccines available anyone wants one walk local CVS get like flu shot, really worry anti-vaxxers much threat got it, assume anyone wanted one got it. Correct? hang on... first person I've seen claims numbers Europe worse US. Let's take second ask arrived there. 

So, numbers seeing?  Dont forget go vote today, matter lazy feel need make polls 13 asymptomatic people identified Sofia test, 12 C.T. values 30s.

Congrats new addition, wish happy life. deaths even offsetting births. population growing.. Yeah im line right now. Go local precinct  saying snake oil cure covid? Gotcha. Anyone thinks coronavirus problem going end November 4, 2020 drooling moron. Can't speak rest Europe, UK houses ridiculously insulated happening often. think one big things AC houses, summer ridiculously hot days, I'm sure almost every house windows open Good. I'll probably never go cruise. COVID-19 cruise ship industry Hindenburg disaster airship industry. baby due next couple months. Wish luck! too. also wished need goverments tell us need stay home. wished behaved like grownups responsible things without someone TV repeat us every day shit serious refuse minor inconvenience literately saves lives. Wearing masks saves lives. wearing mask public helps stop spread disease, normalizes mask wearing makes likely people also wear masks. personally might always pull seeing people (tho decreases efficienty mask usage) people seeing running without mask negatively effects chances wearing mask. self centric view makes selfish. minor inconvenience save people dying getting sick. justify want, makes selfish. No, post get removed. Bye bye :) Nice propaganda piece whitewash inability respond pandemic. hope India quickly develop resources keep people healthy. doubt it, in, worst past. NYTime wrote article 3 days ago death rates falling disease understanding improved. Even cases continue surge, I‚Äôd shocked deaths follow suit. It‚Äôs something aware of, scared of.

Edit: go - CatOwlLife, Leviny previous incarnations.  Exactly. want socially distant world become long-term thing. want make masks permanent. Nonetheless, shouldn‚Äôt get excited news. still don‚Äôt even know whether vaccine works get data. point quite clear know it. want one person point property mask makes one-way. one it. single person that. I've read several published journals dated pre-covid-19 none describe one-way property mask except filter masks- ones ""vent"". masks one way exhalation completely unfiltered. based point, would masks zero direction?  

Look I'd accept ""I know- heard believed it."" least would honest. I've said ill say again. Water cannons filled ghost pepper sauce clear crowd. Could - sadly won't. different disease therapeutics vaccine for.

Quite different scenario, became ill forced interact people, yes, wore mask.

When walking outside people *not* putting masks coming close people. simply happening. Rather make enforcement difficult, make simple way harms one, benefiting everyone.

It piece cloth face winter dude. Get it. problem (ignoring fact disease growth sigmoid maintains exponential increase middle phase) humans general think way. think linear terms. present someone data say, ""tomorrow we're going blow doors everything went before"" that's concept people grok.

But administration made much harder people presenting complexity all. either horrific fine there's nuance ever. Yeah, correct say COVID-19 blood/auto-immune disease rather respiratory one? seems like respiratory issues could stem clotting rather virus attacking lung tissue. completely unrelated subject, many ultra-marathons run last year? deutschen Gesundheitswesen soll die EU genesen still taken seriously many, why? never realized many humans would work help protect humans pandemic. devastated acts humans around me, trying hurt others instead help. 'Just curiosity, would Europeans know better Americans?

Signed,

Someone got measles even thought vaccinated it. like said selfish person. Yes, feel things anywhere near normal 2022 earliest, I'm 32, first (likely only) child. genetic testing first married three years ago, knew make embryo genetic reasons, idea fertility issues might encounter. regret choice, anxiety certainly heightened. ok loosing freedom, fine.

But expect everything work fine. History shown work like apparently history repeats itself. think freezers seem pretty specialized, doubt regular pharmacy would one. loses today, God willing, doubt he'll stick around January 20. resign (in exchange pardon) maybe even flee country escape SDNY charges (he can't pardoned those).

Either way, we're rough winter. IHME model predicting \~2,000 deaths per day December January. know it‚Äôs bad first reaction ‚Äú10%? That‚Äôs low!‚Äù

I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôll hear coming days. thoughts? One, two, skip Also everything Forest Park free admittance. go Zoo, Art Museum, Science Center, History Museum, watch show Muny (although need reserve tickets Muny, they're free), even visit old World's Fair Pavilion. Forest Park, free. They're minor attractions either, they're large major city's zoos museums.

And there's cool, pretty good sized sculpture park called CityGarden downtown walk around.

And Gateway Arch like $3 go into, although lines pretty long.

And far Forest Park there's cool Missouri Botanical Gardens, although free.

Definitely check City Museum, like parent comment said. One weirder places ever go to.

And St. Louis great food. save lot money attractions, spend food. fun, cheap place visit.

Also, like would going partying much anyway, feel like we've focusing keeping kids alive everyone else going crazy boredom. bad part missing family, much close family quarantined caution see babies anyway, we're ok.


The best time plant tree yesterday! blame schools open. Even infections coming schools given people false sense security. many times I've heard people say ""Well 30 kids classroom surely get together 5 friends backyard"" different group friends every weekend. 

I helped friend move weekend truck trailer. assured would two us. Ok fine risk nothing crazy. get says ""I managed get bunch help."" like 12 people pissed! wore mask refused go inside packed trailer unloaded end. they're saying ""Don't worry need wear mask covid"" fuck that.

Probably true, here's thing...

Your subs way overpriced. Face Coverings Save 130,000 American Lives COVID-19 March Many Drinking Ideological Kool-Aid Instead seems like fearmongering.

Looked like another country. 10 minutes away, St. Louis county opposite approach. Everyone mask everywhere indoors go. Hmmm... supply data behind sex panther assertion died bullet them. actually blood loss killed them, bullet‚Äù

What Covid?

Then wouldnt bullet, *or* blood loss .. would Covid.

Because anyone dies Covid Covid death. yeah, news see Ventilator rather Respirator. respirator term reusable mask (like 3m half face mask)  could people caught covid eating without masks collective. everybody eats restaurant, many people bring food eat work common dining area. Workers eat directly site. think people generally less cautious eating group, dont want weirdo sits alone eats working desk computer. think 10% cases makes sence one place take mask eating, people continue eat groups indoors work social gatherings. Thats like saying firefighters evil fires bad. really doubt people forgiving continued problem disease outbreaks. People stopped using airships early 1900's many blew up. [Diamond one example diseases spread cruise ships turn pandemic much worse Hindenburg airship disaster. Respect Germany want give benefit doubt, might inflection point third derivative cases respect days. likely misused term though, lol sadly camps quarantine illegal immigrants starting sound like something Germany world war II whole  Forced sterilization horrible treatment Statistically pretty safe bet. 3x many 14 year window flu deaths. means covid 42x deadly flu average single flu year.

Covid deaths counted completely differently flu deaths.

it's really hard compare numbers like that. Herd immunity time I‚Äôm San Diego I‚Äôve found everything restaurant/bar outbreak reporting intentionally vague. It‚Äôs either intentional, they‚Äôre failing obtain broader set data could really inform people shape way behave.

Edit... didn‚Äôt finish sent it.

Are outbreaks generally people dining table?

Are outbreaks transmitted staff patrons?

Are outbreaks common outdoor dining areas restaurant put overhead sunshades barriers create indoor like environment?

Are outbreaks common bar settings restaurants? (Meaning focus drinking, food. example brewery makes buy pretzel claim it‚Äôs restaurant everyone drink.)

We get broad reporting states X number bar/restaurant outbreaks week. I‚Äôve also really curious outbreaks predominantly staff. walk late night, soon restaurants close, staff unmasked clean shift drink two. would love know number patrons vs staff outbreaks.

There‚Äôs also evidence dine lax attitude virus take risks concerning virus. positively attribute outbreaks outdoor dining many people ones house parties risky behavior?

It‚Äôs confusing! 2-3 hours breeze compared prison sentences I've done London hospital waiting rooms! cut side hand open pretty bad glass waited 8 hours overnight instructed hold hand heart slow bleeding. Free treatment though I'll take it! 

Usually 20-30 min wait Rathaus too. Plan well arrive early first line days...I always surprised different departments actually talk other. Like, anmeldung, without asking get tax number/TV license/etc. Often initial paperwork pain IMo works well afterwards better coordination departments saves time. son SR Kindergarten. I‚Äôve noticed huge positive change since returned school. Schools open vital. 

I agree leads people believe everything normal it‚Äôs not... Good luck tonight. Nah forget that, that's excuse. Even whole thing hoax costs *nothing* wear mask socially distance minimize contact others. 

Yes, brainwashed, they're also incredibly selfish. see every Republican policy one refuse make excuses them. Yeah ""something something USA bad"" OH NOOOO 1,000 PEOPLE NOOOO

NOOOOOO WAY AAAAAAA WAY 1,000 PEOPLE DYING IM SAD ;-; Winter depression brutal - shorter days means less daylight already puts damper people's moods. add fact pandemic raging, economy devastated, lot beloved holidays (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years) disrupted.

It's gonna bad months ahead understanding no, one challenges presented distribution. won‚Äôt available doc local pharmacy, don‚Äôt means store properly. Transportation storage need specialized. Okay, US worse anyone else? Socially distanced gym. many times heard people complain previous person wipe hand? 

When drinking eating, masked, low ventilated room. Bars worse. Drunk people socially distance.  
Number outbreaks, relate many people got sick locations. Ventilators sometimes called ""respirators"", term commonly used smart average person is, remember got chunk people average.

I'm saying I'm smart. I'm saying I'm smarter fair portion population. sorry no, know lot ppl scared, thry think virus air. see walking outside parks one around them. pure fear misinformation No, think deaths related covid US 400k, counting every excess death good starting point. Germany's ICU capacities unlimited, sound like good idea.  thing love US hospitals rationing care PPE leader country says death numbers hoax. post videos Instagram. take three times 150% covered. Easy math Yeah, responded 1 upvote 4 2. Nobody cares actual facts. entire household got sick think common cold, everyone get tested?

We exact symptoms timeframe developing/recovery. GF getting tested job, mother insists everyone get tested. I'm sure pure exponential growth. fact math wheelhouse systems engineer. understand one infected machine infects two others I'm going end lot infected machines. Unless something stop it. 

Just imagine interest pay understand compounding interest lol already happening. EU spiking right due higher latitude. We're lagging US current week week growth 20%. 

Also, compound growth we'll eventually SEE change behavior, question point.

At point notice house infested mice point still exponential growth.

You never end 1B mice even though that's mathematical projection. still get bad though. matter happens US election, hope pandemic response improves. time goes winter comes, we'll learn flu, go away 6 foot rule comes transmission study airplanes yet even stop selling middle seats. masks enough negate risks lives relatively normal mask up, clearly going let us matter compliant are.

People really need think critically decisions made us here. seems totally fine restrict things detriment small businesses improve quality life second starts costing big corporations real money rules matter important.

There people asking questions going crazy extremes answer mean making huge mistakes blindly follow leaders.  Oh god damnit, lmao. Thank you, brain auto-pilot regards numbers 'rona. thought sounded like SNL skit shit looking back pandemic accelerated year. Lucky you. depends would say. general thinks B√ºrgerb√ºro usually ~30 min waiting time me. Hospitals worse. appointment easily wait 2-3 hours. waited 3 hours 4 big cut hand. still almost every medical treatment free covered. good evidence fomite transmission. saying 99% nanotechnology research over-sold grant money, researchers professional getting grant money actually useful research. all, large whack

i'm also saying hold breath nanotechnology cure virus. answer obviously lies biotechnology, macro-scale version chemistry solved problems material domain  ok. buh bye! Hey - can't stop living. me, seem end world wait year, I'd never say everyone grind halt. Congratulations! wishing best! rate, it'll take 900 years kill everyone US. whooshed, joke 911*100 Actually bit trickier European Union none individual countries sovereign currencies printing unfathomable amounts cash like United States could destroy economies member states.

The United States literally print much money wants sovereign currency. side effect inflation printed money goes uber wealthy back economy belongs inflation non existent.

Basically whole system set make rich richer. r/sadupvote/ Yeah thats mean actual plate cover. Might ask sources lead conclusion large demographic refugees?

I mean, refugees seeking asylum Belgium, nowhere enough make meaningful dent statistics country 11m people.

Also, would probably never know, think privacy legislation gather data ethnicity. distinction nationally published data breakdown sex, zip code age brackets 10 years. Hi conspiracy nut! Good luck upping hospital capacities. Greedy CEOs laid tons support staff, even nurses, cried profits. often nurses take patients without surge covid. think we'll see rationing care come. last paragraph source ends article ‚ÄúMedical experts worry surges cases around country could roll back improvements mortality rates. number hospitalized Covid patients increased 40 percent last month, 41,000 patients hospitalized United States.‚Äù 

If number infections outweigh improved treatment deaths would higher lower it‚Äôs opposite. source doesn‚Äôt show evidence either.

So ask article feelings cause that‚Äôs it‚Äôs at. dealers put name plate surround one takes off. easy pick someone comes looking license plate. interesting see whether accept vaccine China UK proven stop transmission severe cases. I'd like think we'd put politics one side, think either country would everyone clear. last time entered ‚Äúzone‚Äù 1,000-3,000 deaths day, every day. looked determined easier quicker get screen protector (already case) wipe phone 70% alcohol whenever get home. think takes like good amount time, like 15 mins, UV really sanitize Think average person.

Cool.

50% people dumber person.

To add small percent ""that"" brilliant. far average line. 

So yeh. Actual smart people (not explicitly intelligent, phd's etc, smart enough follow common sense) minority. Thanks sharing. Take look peer reviewed paper. Imagine year didn‚Äôt get flu shot many people might killed, oh better comparison I'm American dating German often feel like talk Europeans, certain level hubris. Like, course Americans badly, everything sucks there...

I surprised part reason Europe hit hard nowhere well might also bit hubris thinking healthcare system superior thing affect (ie: thinking thing Asia, here).

It pretty common people area (the Northeast) really liberal coastal areas think Europeans advanced lot things (ie: socialized medicine) therefore, better outcomes.

Also note, Reddit also lot major news outlets, kept hearing news Europe WAY better US months blah blah Americans dumb/selfish/not wearing masks/etc...so general, assumption things better.

I also bought idea summer...and visited boyfriend end August Berlin shocked find people give AF wearing masks doors (something rarely saw area)...and behaving relaxed (like pandemic). kept telling friends, shit going blow point...but acted like paranoid happen Europe. Like silly American person happens US Trump...and well, look things. -_- Covid's core replication 3 completely unhindered. course hinder (masks, social distancing, etc).

The EU right spiking hard people changing behavior cold. cold *alone* means replication people indoors holidays coming we're going spike.

This new behavior change replication coefficient we're going learn hard way careful now. I‚Äôm simply saying virus isn‚Äôt left unchecked therefore compound growth put isn‚Äôt going happen. February March 2020 luck world. I'm sure it'll fine you. Look yourselves! table. governors mayors certainly willing consider it. two states one experiencing peak infections still normal situation country average half peak (or adjusted population). imagine 50 states peak, still early stages, half-way up. country mean averages extremes down. Would similar take Europe make average 40ish countries it, compare single country. that's inefficient. Save resources launch clear solar system. Might well save fuel. L.A. funeral family member passed COVID. went restaurant, kept mask unless eating. many others didn‚Äôt. 100% outside unless needed use bathroom kept door open building airflow. haven‚Äôt restaurant year things definitely changed. Staff wore masks hand sanitizer available. believe stat even Thursday evening place busy. ventilator English lies say? Thanks extensive vaccine program, wild polio completely eliminated Africa 

So yes vaccine induced polio cases entire continent 400 cases last year. Thats it. vaccine program eliminate polio continent wild success   yet, people wander streets without masks taunt ones wear them, scot free. (They supposed get fined, hell police?) Something something transmission equine species Right idea math. sort account fact pregnant women generally 15 45 years old, risk 1.7X non-pregnant women age would risk level non-pregnant women age range lower 1/200. low IQ follow leader bullshit basically cult following  I‚Äôm still going wearing mask? Literally half people less average intelligence. Looking hospitalisations, still beginning. sign flattening yet nearing hospitalisations first wave (now 26k versus 32k peak first Regardless confusing aspects article, CDC study found 300 infected people given location (I forget details), half eaten inside restaurant two weeks prior infection. safe ways eat indoors, remain theoretical one invested money build would take make safe. it. Current vaccines 2 shots either 3 weeks 4 weeks apart. guess would mean 4 shots year. ""Cytokine storm"" poor choice words. Similar others saying ""Nanoparticles"" poor choice cause negative connotation.

Release cytokines common everyday thing happens healthy body. cytokines would probably worse many.

Elevating cytokines body recognizes possible infection GOOD THING. immune system communicates strong, coordinated attack area infection. often case human body, much good thing cause bad effects, i.e. much water cause cells ""drown."" effects severely elevated cytokines inflammation, causes many bad effects seen severe coronavirus infection. 

So one draw line ""cytokine storm"" ""elevated cytokines benefit fighting infection""? symptoms start? Let ask this, many fever experienced associated fatigue? symptoms come cytokines, infection. Would consider cytokine storm? No. part infectious process quite common. start getting organ failure start calling storm. 

As the, ""stronger response"" immune system virus encountered vaccination, would think less ""stronger"" response ""more precise"" response. immune system two major modes battling infections: Humoral (more precise) cell mediated (less precise).

She regularly tested health care worker (as states) probably often exposed. also said would never known Covid second time received routine test would never sought test own. first bout virus severe; imply hospitalized definitely sick enough rush ER.

This second time around symptoms, good news disease second time - exactly immune system worked, caveat is, instance, sterilizing immunity.  So, first time serious, second time asymptomatic caught routine test. Hopefully common response someone chance gets reinfected serious first time. way around would show based bias symptoms (of course they'll reported), asymptomatics, could vast majority, would not. mean, uncommon expect better terms health outcomes Europe (for obvious reasons). There's less obesity better healthcare system overall...also less politicization COVID overall.

Obviously Europe monolith though.

Also, lot COVID news major newspapers American centric awhile. Cowards. That's definitely one stupidest things. Newsome done much better job handling governors.

But, get idiot OC conservatives live real world getting butthurt reality match Faux News. safer ways make voice heard. Contact MPs (or Representatives, live U.S.). Make protest art. Support local charities. 

Protests good way elicit breaking change policy regular times, pandemic. absolutely want organize protest, make sure wearing mask, stand 2 meters apart people, avoid shouting. That‚Äôs dark, dude.

I've personally never heard anyone say masks completely prevent COVID-19. Even N95s claim filter 95% nasties, cloth masks definitely silver bullet. block enough prevent many infections reduce initial viral load get infected.

There still lot unknowns COVID-19, everything that's come lately shown value masks consequences using them. tRiEd n0tHinG ideAs. worry, US still far worse one else.

I know boilerplate reddit response, true lol really. Chicken pox kid generally minor inconvenience. adults, far, far higher chance carrying serious health implications.

Omg dream :) Nah giving one twice week, worry. Middle America us covered.  [One raw overall noninstitutionalized IFR Covid fatalities remain low infection numbers becoming less deadly Europe know second wave Spanish flu happened virus made first round population, consequence mutation.

We're going virus' ""first round"": rather small part population infected, waves purely artificial lockdown mitigation measures. comparable all. sat national TV took vaccine, people would complain getting preferential treatment. others would claim fake, took placebo, fool everyone. They'll love overworked long sufficient clapping.  Turning corner Jesus christ illinois. bull, suitable weapon media election. Everyone talking Second Wave since April.

There reason anyone unprepared. staff, facilities, infrastructure. Yer spare parts, bud. say vaccine comes time soon seems rushed me, makes nervous. thought needed longer term testing efficacy safety.

Edit add: ""Not OP but..."" Newsflash: there‚Äôs world US. stimulus check applies country. others, government support, many people still self-isolate follow basic rules physical distancing wearing masks. That‚Äôs lockdowns happening countries like France UK. logic enforcement perspective. everyone arguing every possible scenario said ""enough, wear time."" disagree enforced first place different matter. exhausting listening reading people praising lord doctor's hard work saving life. well That‚Äôs exponentials work.

1 million dead Biden.

2 8 million trump. ideal unit measure fear-mongering idiots.

In normal year 1000 9/11s worth deaths occur causes America. Entering? past months? gonna start 1.5-3k day. people use phase one say pandemic over

Yep, thats sadly expect well... minute vaccine officially declared safe working, approved starts delivered, people act already vaccinated, without single dose administered yet.... think news needs cut ""hospitals full"" headlines. 

They proven incorrect many times.  January, number official COVID deaths could 9/11 times 100.

""9/11 times hundred?! god, that's...""

""Yes. Ninety-one thousand one hundred.""

(But we're already past that) Why? direction. sharp turn upward still ""turning corner."" Germany? doubt.
But still can‚Äôt wait stay line get shot proof. Literally ever article ""even care yourself, bring home grandma."" Spreading home exactly everyone thought. likely make enforcement easier hermit almost 9 years get much human contact. 

When abruptly decided opposite hermit, got really sick every time made someone. 

I actually got tonsils removed it. 

Eventually, built immunity rarely happened again, I'm assuming thing happen finally over. Oh, kept hearing masks work apparently work well people saying. Breathing fresh air banned. suuuuucks. Like, example, JB Pritzker I'm asking question. so? New cases starting flatten? Yesterday second highest day record, I‚Äôm sure think it‚Äôs flattening. anything it‚Äôs going even faster days ago Well, case, medical science back requirement.

And cases anymore, also civil criminal penalties governing say.

But alone? everywhere public? Even medically needed?

That medically ridiculous. feeds directly anti-mask narrative.

This sort insanity gives mask rules bad name. Interesting timing Make argument stop signs. tyranny? They‚Äôre put place keep people safer inside outside vehicle. followed law consequences breaking laws associated them.

Where people screaming protesting stop signs?

BUT MUH RIGHT STOP WHEREVER GOD DAMN WELL PLEASE! LAW SIGN TELLS WUT CUZ FREEDUM!

Masks thing. Safety others. Stop baby wear bit cloth face go help others stay safe. making months. delay safety testing. Perhaps future, less novel viruses could see vaccines even faster. Depending results election, data might suppressed, might ""go away"". US, city Oklahoma helping hospitals North Texas. Think around 40 Texans ICU. ~7000 beds left ""Other countries elections?!"" anything, probably end bureaucratic nightmare. Vaccine coming couple months. already have. several SILs seemed happy that. haven‚Äôt read literature come late months concluding case, happy state shut downs cause economic damage? live Italy. sister's classmate's dad tested positive 4 days ago. closed school even test classmate yet, positive test kids teachers. kids us families officially put quarantine (I going parents go work sibling go school). Assuming kid positive, we're talking potential positive people going around unchecked days days. multiply 60 million people. That's what's happening. think governments pretty eager lift restrictions. think vulnerable vaccinated death rates begin drop restrictions lifted aggressively. case numbers go without corresponding deaths restrictions continue lifted. 

I expect based data don‚Äôt think take two years unless enough antivaxers refuse cases/deaths remain high. ""mAyBe mAdE uP?!?!?!"" point source talks ideally links news (fuck even reddit comments about) least say hundred separate confirmed even ""unconfirmed tested"" reinfections, I'll start consider valid argument.  

How 600 cases, [one Washington state investigating 120 suspected cases reinfection, according state‚Äôs health department, confirmed figure response questions BNO News. cases least 90 days two episodes research needed confirm rule reinfection. ‚ÄúWe aware deaths,‚Äù department said. immediately known many suspected cases subject genomic sequencing. 

  Health officials Brazil investigating least 247 possible cases COVID-19 reinfection, according CNN Brazil. patients tested negative episodes. It‚Äôs unknown many cases subject genomic sequencing confirm rule reinfection.
   retrospective study confirmed cases Mexico found 258 suspected cases reinfection, including 11 people died. None cases confirmed genomic sequencing, one requirements, thus none added tracker. study defined reinfection reappearance COVID-19 symptoms interval least 28 days. median interval 56 days age 50. Patients seriously ill first time likely develop severe symptoms second time, well age 50 chronic diseases, according study.

So, researching topic reading websites researching? Odd research strategy. Infection requires someone passing briefly, requires time concentration. getting ""tons droplets"" seconds someone passing unless sneeze/cough you. different enclosed space hour surrounded people. stopped talk you, close up, issue. can't nice things. announced resolving 12 h work day limit nurses. what? Less people dying, less people falling sick. Thats good, time, numbers go measures place fade. ""The best way prevent disturbances reopening reopen"" read that? Lol.. feel like need wash eyeballs out.. Lockdown happened! Lockdown containment measure, global lockdown foolish beyond belief always destined fail! 

We lost battle soon virus escaped Wuhan, quicker allow thing burn out, better whole!  year shown vast bulk Americans way dumber thought possible. can't imagine anyone drag country 20th century much dead weight actively resisting it. ‚ÄúThink stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.‚Äù

‚Äï George Carlin german mean genuine besides fact war military spendings. so? seriously remarkable.

It's unconfirmed speculation. complicated convoluted plot James
Bond movie ever. they‚Äôre saying tone change, virus gonna disappear.  forgotten mention:
""Wash hands"" ;) make easier? they're going \*actually enforce it\* could enforced original rule, case I'd say could gone blatant offenses (people walking busy areas without mask). really \*that\* worried borderline cases (someone outdoors 4ft away, say), given sources community spread?  new Dems hundreds thousand supporters waiting sacrifice lives make fake virus look real? /s 7k beds free everyone needs vote. another stupid prediction. one right yet, doesn‚Äôt seem stop anyone making ridiculous proclamations like this. Cause know long term health effects? Jeeze. Since know that, kind releasing cure? Someone hit much evidence muster face shields alone acceptable substitute wearing mask general population? population France 67 millions (woops, edited :-)) .

By way, 850 deaths: around 420 happened last 24h hospitals; 430 bi-weekly retirement home reports (coming Tuesdays Fridays).

(which explains why, tomorrow, death figure France probably around 400/450 800 like today) Women childbearing age low risk begin with, even risk doubles, still relatively small number. absolutely take additional precautions, scary headline make sounds. 

Age based fatality risk : (Females expect fatality risk bit lower these)

0-4: 0.00052%

5-14: 0.0013%

15-24: 0.0045%

25-44 : 0.031%

45-64: 0.46%

65-74: 3.1%

75+ : 18% people lose minds wear masks social distancing can‚Äôt achieved. sucks, exactly do? throw hands say ‚Äúoh well, tried‚Äù ? Thanks! edited comment. miraculously disappear time wall built paid Mexico. LOL, statement literally non-German say without getting raised eyebrows. ;) /r/AyyMD deadly phase... *so far.*  kind funny much stuff conspiracy nuts saying actually talked about.

Quarantine camps, digital currency, eternal lockdowns, (almost) mandatory vaccine .. *now nanoparticles!* :)

That's stuff conspiracy nuts shouting back April. long take vaccine start working, like instant thing take time?  - I‚Äôd imagine get 8 months covid lockdown they‚Äôre strong enough get two years loan (a third forgiven!) gone Easter. sure year though. France 67 million pop. assume someone trying enforce deal ""Are 6 ft 4 ft apart? sort inside outside? People walking problem?"" says ""f-it, wear time""

Now question enforcement. subset reacts severely dies. look forward day predict camp person falls in. cases continuing surge? 7 day rolling average pretty much stayed constant last 2 weeks hyped mass project work lot cases going undetected. I'm pretty sure average person nearly dumb think are. denial virus stems lack trust. media fear mongers 20 years straight, wonder people believe like ""wait, virus actually threat time"" 

Then look statistics younger people actually low risk dying this.  head doctor saying wear masks, later coming saying ""just kidding, masks law wear them. said wear earlier could make sure doctors got first"".  brain says ""well, trust guy anymore. know he's lying something else justifying way"". 

  bring shit people call anti science shit. go literal cdc website see vast majority people dying like 70+. 

It's complicated everyone. wear mask go large indoor events. absolutely must, maybe go see grandparents afterwords lol.  Imagine that, inexplicable delay everything looks status quo. almost like they're fabricating data hide extent what's going entire economy tourist based. know like hospitalizations listed people COVID primary disease. positivity rate includes repeat negative tests people. last laugh tho?! Poland full blown revolution point lmao think mention vaccine ready soon comes healthy dose skepticism. 

That said, I‚Äôm upvoting ready roll sleeve. could use good news days ffs. overactive immune response concern people literally every vaccine. That‚Äôs anti-vaxxers. it‚Äôs association autism vaccines. Inflammatory immune responses. it‚Äôs really interesting see ‚Äúregular‚Äù people actually expressing concerns immune system response vaccine. don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre basically reiterating concerns people make fun of. leadership lies it‚Äôs ok blame them. real. I've also hearing 2021 year. expect believe 2021 actually coming, you? thing! going go decorating give festive feeling. husband sad though told would likely set Christmas tree outdoors. Like signaling too. one near habit have. Sorry. Total cases (and deaths) million 


375,890 total cases ever, divided (~17) million population ~22,117 cases per million sorry, way compare countries, adjust pop! someone math. normal people 1/200

So pregnant women 1.7/200? Nahnahnah gotta put /s last half homie Yes. Germany ICU beds per million inhabitants neighboring countries also earlier second wave them. still accept foreign patients. scary experts saying ""hope"" able avoid triage situations - day 2 month-long ""soft"" lockdown (no fun activities allowed, schools workplaces remain open, two households may meet time private). mean like backflush?

Sorry, I'll see out. people say people whole heartedly believe it‚Äôs hoax sake election... they‚Äôre clearly morons. Turns Americans really global chants ""Death America"" decided make official public policy. lie /s given statement point, almost 10 months in.

Good thing gonna disappear magically, starting tomorrow. do, majority profit comes booze Yeah would imagine something killing plane crash's worth people every 3 days would coverage single, hypothetical plans crash. appear Monday's numbers, sure headline says ""Tuesday."" 

The article says: *""The information Nov. 2. News 6 update information data Nov. 3 made available.""* can't give someone heart disease breathing them. conversation co-worker today went like ""Hey, virus flu whatever gotten better right? hear news anymore""

Me: üòê Wearing mask help lot.

I think restaurants particularly dangerous people can't wear masks eating drinking. That's that's chose killed live isolation.

I guess granny important choosing keep distance wear mask meet random people close contact complaining less social contacts.

Just part, invite good friends can, fun (but maybe fun) avoid next lockdown. Realistically? pretty likely protests regardless wins election. That's targeting. People spontaneously burst flames greater risk death, though risk remains small. told best friend May/June coming... like, fine here. think alot resistance lockdown deliberate de-humanizing party.

Just like calling people rats cockroaches past genocides, deliberate effective campaign divide America.

As part campaign, intellectualism demonized, emotionalism promoted. simply, something upsets bad, makes feel happy good.

And feeling superior others apex feeling good. 

People fallen emotionalism going adhere masks (uncomfortable, kinda gross) avoiding social gatherings (loneliness, depressing), trained unhappy = bad.

So people pushing science, blah blah blah going demonized people, preaching 'evil'. 

FYI, also narcissists adhere guidelines, share ""how something makes feel determines good bad (right wrong)."".

Is way forward, sure, need address root cause rot... can‚Äôt read hear orange turds voice head US managed government employer pays monthly costs unemployment insurance It‚Äôs little Covid molecule Brave Little Toaster adventure.

I find one poorly understood aspects pandemic discussing people. I'm even surprised people still seem hold idea despite seen happening Europe past couple months. See responses redditors - they're pretty conclusive. trying use study support opinion unrelated. Thank mentioning state Charlie Baker in. Start giving people fines $500-$5000 found multiple violations, jail time. 80% normal interesting idea. Like, may want packed dive bar movie theater while, business may open next summer. That‚Äôs one definition normal. go without stuff additional 6-12 months feel safe friends dinner, visiting parents kids weekend, without masks social distancing. don‚Äôt necessarily go back never thinking disease transmission, way 2019, things feel pretty normal. kind uncomfortable wear night week see anything changed! e fakest fake news I‚Äôve heard today.

Are retainer Ontario teachers pension fund. richest pool money planet earth? Infinite means goes forever never stops. would keep going Milky Way on. didn‚Äôt read article. Brave words. mean we're talking strict lockdown matter weeks. unfortunate people thought trade-off public health economy. 

There might trade-off linear economy never normal without covid control. gloves probably matter since virus transmitted skin like toxin. masks wearing probably N95 style masks would expect - medical grade masks used prevent doctors/surgeons infecting patients sterile environment, rather way around.

I think general grocery store like around nuclear materials, even low doses, time spend there, less protection going help, even harmful stuff blocked out, get enough low-grade exposure become infected.

If u dont stand ur statements bring up? Oh wait, cus u can! Good one? dog bite u dont want leash, cus also 'CHOICE'.

edit: people trust media t\*ump get away saying shit does. say Florida actually looking pretty good

Daily new cases low rising slowly, expected arrival colder weather.

Meanwhile, daily new deaths months-long *downward* trend, currently lowest point since beginning July. Gotcha. pro mask, pro science, pro basic humanity. going for, ...best decisions, keep going (on lives masks). want treated like child temper needs 24/7 helicopter surveillance? Grow then!

Freedom comes responsibility. Responsibility implies think consequences everybody else act. shortage result patient technicians, medical assistants CNAs tasked advanced care?

We're talking workers working now, laid workers. vaccine, I‚Äôd feel safe going back work mask (I worked server). would life changing cause unemployment bullshit. Right. spots active infection (if virus load high enough). PCR test reliable, also spots active infections. blood test see infection past, e.g. see many asymptomic cases unnoticed.  Generally look countries 1M pop 10M get clearer picture. Damn. Raves really jumped shark they‚Äôre happening *Utah*. live Melbourne understand masks work. people wear that's mask working.

Unfortunately that‚Äôs people actually want I'm confused would useful. someone cough, checked quarantined anyway. Fast testing benefit screening asymptomatic since they're ones undetected public areas. lose, cant win either. suppose go unneccesarily killing huge excess people.

jesus xmas Bacteria viruses can't get medical grade mask. issue touch outside mask, later touch face. that, always wash hands (lots of) soap removing mask. Always treat hands contaminated properly washed. 1 * can't lockdown know sick


2 * can't lockdown food eat

I agree. software improving, ready trust life. I'm working Washington State college online only, 150 students dorms, normally would 1000, basically students nowhere else go, spreading students dorms, shared rooms all. think universities state made plans, better others obviously. losing shit ton money policy employees required take furlough day month, small price pay safety students, staff, citizens town in. guess didnt understand sarcasm. never go away US

But truth is, escaped mess country enjoying normal life China last 6 months. squashed fast effectively here. also 54 statistic.


It's fault CDC dosent cut statistics right 50.

Sorry people want downplay deadly virus understand people 50 stayed home, economy would really go crap.

If must tiring defeatists keep moving goalposts.


The U.S. President fly away White House doctors practice staffed couple dozen medical professionals long weekend real hospital something guys calling hoax plandemic several months earlier. Per article, belief actions don‚Äôt affect others opposed caring actions affect others. anyone realize gotta mask fly?  protesting eating out? UK, Italy, France highest daily deaths today since Spring. He's still it. Maybe ought put no-flight list - restrict travels. Anyway, could use underground tunnels escape White House run Russia sees election results. /s Hopefully passengers sue late, missing connections, etc..  nonpaywalled full Yes, varies lot region region. malls ok, virtually abandoned.

Though, really referring strip malls shopping plazas mostly fine around (minus big box casualties). much giant indoor ""shopping malls"".

Around here, virtually nobody would see parked city hall. Park places grocery stores maximum impact. People still buy food. possible world fire new cases China counts 49 new ones? Imagine multiple jumbo jets go every day President like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Turkey blames Syria new spoke coronavirus cases.

Syria blames Iraq....

And goes.... think would work? think that, say, Chile, opportunity buy vaccines would say ‚Äúnah, let‚Äôs give Argentina‚Äù? two graphs linked show deaths rise several weeks cases rise.

There huge case bump June parallel deaths.

And cases ""spiking"" past 6 weeks real parallel would potentially looking data already released public able make tentative planning steps release papers public? ‚ÄúRed Wave‚Äù Trump keeps talking ü§î starters, could - beginning - refused parrot repeat POSOTUS' lies.... would amazing thing start with, yeah. think people calculate excess deaths unaware population growth fail account that? one saving grace orange buffoon least appear believe vaccines Biden wins, coronavirus become deadly threat isn‚Äôt enough control despite office yet. probs example price then, they‚Äôd likely give $1200|1500 support families, depending size. Ok, see you‚Äôre saying, think pretty much everyone knows masks stopping coronavirus spread. Responsible actions like staying away crowds, keeping distance wearing masks near people probably effect encouraging others via normalization. 

However, wearing mask car literally nothing, people think ‚Äúthat guy doesn‚Äôt know virus work‚Äù

I think got root disagree comment, that‚Äôs ok. never giving away many spaces (the question asked asked high level government official answer) currently already lockdown prevent happening. worse find another job hope end passing along virus others roommate.  going end well many people ""surviving"" covid19 whether getting recovering dealing losing people it, going change people forever change course entire lives result change entire world good way.  Even 1 year later facing dramatically different world right now.  like 5 years road 10? questions solve current problems matter lot people realize decisions made going determine future.

edit: also thank concern helping :) I'm way. Fuck idiots. [From Team America: World yeah, estimating offiical death count around 290,000 late December, would 9/11 time 100. No, herd immunity scenario Covid, according current thinking virology community. (This Week Virology podcast) [Pick country Europe (we'll use Western nations sake much similarity possible) tell Well selfishness virtue know.. Oh shocker!

It‚Äôs like care themselves. Unfortunately that's still going enough lfk people. 

Obviously assistance better none buteven single person rent whole payment. Good luck getting medications food gas nccessities funny many things conspiracy nuts say could seen coming true.

I remember calling masks ""slippery slope"". Getting someone says testing. Hospitalizations continuing climb we're using field hospital now.  Yep, give single fuck people tantrum(s) cause die. :( 


Scorched earth policy go plan, seems. One nice televangelists God's number speed dial blew Covid away magical breath also, fine, probably sundown. Oh *surely* date wont get pushed back! wrong keep turning makes circle third circle, ""doctors"" would call third wave. /s headline worse reality case Atta airline, Southwest. Ban bastage life file $5 million civil suit disrupting operations. would go happened South US. think far people's tendencies staying indoors (where viruses easier spread)...of course, seasonal aspect air everything help either. Thank - I've curious appreciate info. :) borrow best good friend Bubba: Shellfish shellfish does. I'm early on. waited start flu season ""second wave."" husband treats COVID patients. Even though state spiking good public health infrastructure (I lived FL, AZ, TX). husband's hospital's COVID census always around 5. figured might well see happens. misses appointments, sucks going one hopefully. figured we'd milk company's WFH policy now, means might deal daycare absolutely safe. course Diamond Princes cause pandemic, sure would nightmare aboard city let asymptomatic passengers disembark.

Regardless whether government restrictions, many people want use leisure activities. think roles cruise ships played spreading virus remembered much memories spread conventions, campaign rallies, dining out, ball games theater movies. airship industry safety improved using helium instead hydrogen, still never made comeback. political issue. virus nearly 1 year old point.  know works part know happen (new stuff continually cropping up) know best defend yet people keep making political. people keep pushing policy increases death infection rates. people ones making worse.  NONE play way.  choosing support play way. ""White House coronavirus task force: Florida *NOW openly recognized admitted be* (a?) red zone rate new cases"" 


FTFY 61,662 refugees Belgium that's interesting @ ethnicity privacy medical Belgium. breakdowns african americans, latino, asians, COVID USA

Thanks answers question. reason discussed privacy laws! meant March 2021. calculated IFR would specific outbreak.

What know implies IFR across full demographics US bit 1%. since never get people sick evenly across demographics could vary tremendously outbreak outbreak. Another problem 50 vaccine candidates globally. Ideally, need perform tests see effective - cannot done timely manner probably years relevant data vaccines available. Therefore, chance vaccines coming right really offer much immunity / optimal. know yet cannot know vaccine best - moment need something distribute. Anything works do, eventually sufficient data really pinpoint vaccine effective. miss browsing bookstores spending afternoon reading cafe somewhere. Back think contaminated indoor air...or eating indoors without fear. :P Nice try. Post something back got test done within 15 minutes leaving home. 

But seems north-east berlin much testing facilities. known conservatives impacted smog, pollution waste management.  thinking? Wow, piece trash guy is. Sorry happened dad. careful NYC argument. First, people congregate care facilities likely get sick group especially likely die get sick. Second, IFR *fixed*. function quality treatment. Dexamethasone even knowledge orient bodies people ventilators driven mortality rate. think 1% *believable* number, least. also extremely high. Good know! figured case, mind curious imagine. Here's hoping test comes back negative. They'll say specify year. regret times thought, I'm tired, I'll go/do next time. you‚Äôre totally right, interesting note Los Angeles restaurants outdoor exceptions. rates activity still high making eating outside risky activity. need information: bars, people meeting outside households, etc. people keep saying children fine dying worst thing could happen them.  losing entire family virus ruin lives.  go take walk preferably long one short pier. back retired 65+ year old staff help handle virus hits 65+ demographic hardest?

People actually volunteer stuff, y'know?

There tons support roles dangerous.

The idea need years bolster numbers crazy. would think nations ever fought wars before. There's restaurant near opened end March. Terrible timing. take grocery/pantry boxes allowed open outdoors. big patio pretty flowers decor, seems really popular. hardly go anywhere, I've walked there's always line. People seem happy go new place, support neighborhood restaurant enjoy dining outdoors. Best luck family! Germany allowed 370k soldiers. part 2+4 treaty. everyone wants document distribution like - good video easy watch. Obviously date posted month half ago issues tackled completely least partially, still informative. oooooohhhhhh like Florida orange juice, like 1/3 OJ grown Arizona. OK makes sense ty mean, yes. understand ""We expect act others expense"" OK ""I expect act (by letting act myself)"" not. Keeps going up. People still don‚Äôt seem care here. together, all.

Good know.

He something similar domestically PPE gear. worked brilliantly, think failing sign genius. borders still open Sweden? always said ironically, people really believe that's going happen?!?! themselves. Makes sense. Fair enough, mention delivered may much choice matter, pandemics radar last fall. Ok I‚Äôm gonna honest. state dumb? TIL trump bad wants vaccines America buys go Americans first? figure will. still plan way. Maybe zoom call day of, know. Nothing. call contact tracing necessary negative. governor's actions, lives matter anyway. It‚Äôs flood. lockdown poorly enforced, ignored people 2 3 weeks, specially comes guidelines, actively sabotaged biggest portion media, hardcore anti-peronists. There's way could worked conditions. Bring back retired 65+ year old staff help handle virus hits 65+ demographic hardest? hope, once, right. People dying real disease, going end, deadstop, November 4th. love God let right. one time want crazies right. mean 99 100 age 85?

Well ""one hospital"" isnt ""all hospitals"" either. state everyone No, considered app concluded benefits might outweigh infringement personal integrity. recent comments EU, might change.

She's doctor we're Texas. 

I can't even stress tired ask family friends put care social acceptance anymore. updates this? I've gradually losing sense smell mouth feels like graveyard. 

My job kinda relies sense smell I'm really scared :( made sound like either work dangerous job collect unemployment. I'm saying many, unemployment longer option. time election.  even smaller everyone wearing masks. reduce odds even one simple adjustment?

And I'm talking one two people. easily encounter two dozen people one afternoon walk, easily coming within couple feet due size sidewalks. crowded areas, crowded easily accessible. Unfortunately, area also experiencing larger increase cases. bought soany sets PJs onesies, I'm hurry return work clothes lol Yeah LAAB project could really good. Much longer half life potential protection year proven effective.... Damn, maybe Reddit accredited medical school all... anyone share workplace's/school's covid policies are? co-worker mine got text contact tracer hospital visited (for unrelated covid reason) also visited covid-positive patient. told everyone work group chat, said would call health center morning, yet we're sitting 9:30 morning. Another co-worker said fever today. normal people peoples' workplaces?? got Covid right cannot isolate 2 weeks. I'm supposed room rent Nov 10th, currently nowhere else go. I'm one situation like this. country believes everybody somewhere stable live. 

Even friend mine's son ended nowhere else go living porch 2 weeks, got sick there? nowhere go. parents (my friend) health conditions force make leave. disagree, running business, would incentivize less want business knew going taxed more. employer business owner incur expenses, clouding pay.


Why penalized wanting make money? Widespread, yes. used consistently thoroughly locations. let facts get way good headline. changed bit. new wave going two months announcement. That's nowhere close adequately quick response. Let's face it, stop blaming politics. everyone making worse.

Asian great time crisis.

Most us stimulus checks, work too, living dense area, poor government policies (some even outright saying masks, F Carrie Lam).

We still fine.

We wonder flu. Even so, bad catch one. 
We rarely talk effectiveness masks, let alone arguing protects others more. even study different standard masks, ask random guy street he/she tell you. 
We wear masks properly. wonder even medical personnel EU NA wear wrong way. 
STOP GATHERING. difficult go parties? smaller wedding?  
Conspiracy theorists: hoax. one, whole world like really good job making looks real.


STOP BLAMING POLITICS. BLAME YOURSELVES. Reddit seems Higgins high regard. Reddit wrong? kids probably survive fine. problem is, they're ""super spreaders"". Wow, sure did. I'm North Queensland. bloody lucky we?
I looking holiday since started things stabilize even needed state borders place time, I'd love make trip Broome. I've always wanted go there. appreciated comment, interesting unpack data tease may actually represented results Tyranny? Lol, dramatic. Patients transferred city hospitals state. 

I hate say much sentiment rural areas ""we need city, falsely believe taxes go support 'urban poor' (euphemism black people,) value self sufficiency freedom independence"" yet false sense macho, cowboy self-sufficiency comes crashing **any** kind emergency, financial natural. 

I pay taxes fine paying extra make sure everyone needs met, daily living emergencies. proud talk ""going live life normal, virus lib conspiracy"" whole town gets sick time church outbreak following rules, think independent free. can't breathe need go hospital populated area. I'm glad you! Everyone able get care! 

I'm fine taking care people sick! I'm fine arrogance fake self-sufficiency fake ""personal responsibility,"" truth *everyone else* pay ""freedom"" follow rules. delusional feeling power independence subsidized safety nets cities (mostly) pay for. clean mess?  simple googling shows hasn‚Äôt isolated 9 months. I‚Äôm sure disqualifies someone getting you‚Äôre fired it‚Äôs usually happy time convince someone sign paperwork. Besides employer doesn‚Äôt want pay extra money person unemployment definitely won‚Äôt go way make easier someone sign paperwork stating fired. people can't right thing. So, since stopped paper newspaper (due fact one would read it), Independent gone biased telling outright *lies*.

The US nowhere close cases per capita.

It's surprise thread r/politics full people uncritically accepting misinformation. guarantee people consider well-educated critical thinkers vastly superior Fox News viewers. Thanks :) I'm sorry feel way. reserve safe space scream sky? Please let us know. Definitely never advocated going wars never declared. Especially US. also disagree, think problem furlough scheme devalues currency much lowers value thereby increasing price goods along living expenses. 


The government gets involved less less gets done. prepared - eating, drinking, bubble gum hours test?

Also, throat swab less accurate think people medical license nasopharyngeal swab invasive harm done bad (I guess). mentioned symptoms I'd associate possible spread. Headache fatigue vectors.  grocery stores open 1am Massachusetts? stage good. illuminates tons ""oh damn mask me"" happen randomly encounter people unexpectedly numerous reasons. I'd say millions unexpected encounters occur daily. They‚Äôll travel north Maine New Hampshire anyway, stay home state!

MA residents coming Maine beaches, please explain think ‚Äúessential‚Äù travel? Especially Massachusetts nice beaches own, technically, slightly south, beaches marginally warmer... vaccine ever coming.  one around, one know mask on. Except grubby hands increases risk infection. Unless every second life sanitize hands perfectly. trust one get hands perfectly clean.
Not mention, guys worn masks like rest world already used mask around face. Even enough forget even there.

Edit: typos 6 weeks flatten curve! we‚Äôll back normal! Don‚Äôt selfish! Save lives! call said, unrealistic na√Øve expect different result. virus can't hidden basement, unfortunately. Btw, 98% survival rate age 65 even higher. Wow! Good news finally! gonna lie I‚Äôm gonna hop vaccine train right away, will, thank you! vaccinated protected, harder virus spread. No, I‚Äôm anti Vaxxer I‚Äôm science, don‚Äôt really want take right away. test free? so, would say great policy Exactly. thought afraid dying. said afraid heart damage lung damage life agony. leaving basement 7 months means living society. countries like Liberia Rwanda manage infection number (so age matter) fine, understand countries couldn't, outbreak even described inevitable.

I also think South Korea abhorrent. really good contact tracing. Japan? they're abhorrent?

I think least little delusional, probably ignorant. they'll sue kids get sick possibly die covid wtaf??? Damn that‚Äôs real shit Ok. sign paper accept you‚Äôre fired based that. also remember Americans don‚Äôt employment contracts, correct? 

Here getting fired means void employment contract, thus need sign another paper works proof fired. Doesn‚Äôt matter got fired either, fired=fired. area, Walmart considered ""essential"" since sell groceries. think open 24 hours except little grocery marketplace ones. buy disposable mask CVS $1.50. Then, reuse it. spent billions pointless wars mate. UK poor country myth governments can't support people. Tough times ahead they'd tougher jobs lost due furlough scheme. worry ill drive around car mask day. kids carriers. bring home risk relatives. understand policy Omg I'm stressed guys. Please stay safe possible &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 Small Businesses Dying Thousands ‚Äî One Tracking Carnage...I can‚Äôt give number.

Edit: googled population density.

Belgium: 383 per km
India: 382 per km

Lmao Belgium terrible vs Covid??? Unfortunately I'm American too. kid dies half country celebrates death, probably go churches wax poetic sanctity life. Garbage country full garbage people statistical improvement. millions outdoor solo activities occurrences encounter others unexpectedly. Someone walks you. issue need interact others random reasons etc. getting point tightening screws can. bad let get far taking serious enough better chance containment. mean ga derrrrr detect virus laughing united states' handling virus? understand, they're fast cheap enough think compromise could still work. 

Vaccines coming save us year two. can't SIP long (most able all). cheap ass employers require unions would insist consumers would too. Heck, I'd like friends without worry. That‚Äôs true, thank you. bit wealth redistribution, share burden fairly. breath becomes easier aerosolised winter lower humidity

Isn't see breath winter times humidity low? Maybe next he‚Äôll mandate inside homes cars.. needs logic cold seasons lets mandate safety blankets Linus start spending lockdown get numbers contact tracing levels.

For Germany, we'd need three half year filled ICUs 7500 deaths/month herd immunity - maybe we'd lose immunity less time. lockdown least 300 000 people would die lack ICU, maybe 250 000 Covid.

With &lt;1000 infections/day, contact tracing \_was\_ possible could things almost normally. (But summer numbers went people would listen slow spread.) people read heavy scientific jargon, need believe. people think continue mask/distance year+ vaccine widely distributed, endgame? know it‚Äôll take time people vaccinated essentially ‚Äútake effect‚Äù current vaccine candidates mainly prevent severe infections/symptoms. can‚Äôt see us needing indefinitely distance wear masks waiting second generation vaccine/for cases reach near zero/etc. started new job late last year rural area still staying friend's apartment come March, lost new job. could stay 1 br apartment matter what. nowhere else go. returned previous area live car fairly urban area. Daily life car means public quite bit would use stores bathroom stops food. 

I finally found room rent, turns crazy lady, dunno exactly I'm going go week half, many options even get hired job end week. 

People, especially so-called experts, believe everybody stable housing supposed hide years virus runs course. 

I certainly appreciate ""scientists"" pointing finger never lost job first place considering existence put people risk. long line polls close, still vote. can't remember 2004 2008 cast ballot til hours polls closed. (I vowed never permanent early voter list). get quickly immunity waned.

Their immunity wane, study even states ""none developed cold"". methodology section 30 year old study defined reinfection viral shedding day, showing signs symptoms. 

I see concerns asymptomatic spread regards people's fear get sick *twice* (eg people worry hear news stories 'reinfections'), fear supported study usefull... account sample size I'll take 8 cases 24 hours normal holiday season. think worth it. keep spinning circles... Congratulations! You‚Äôre fucked general Virus tend live longer cold dry climate. Tropical climate hot moist good bacteria bad viruses like Corona. Every evidence around glove supporting far.

No, not. Disproved multiple times. Multiple tropical climates massive problems virus May June July hot wet.

The impact temperature people's activity, people outdoors music festivals family barbecues still spreading virus.

You're literally talking bullshit disproved early April. might want try updating info. embarrassingly winter everyone starts go inside, people ventilate less bam, heavily encrease chance infections.

So means even impressive Victoria managed get cases control winter. seasons matter, Europe could easily copied Australia got better results thanks season. Except didn't, explanation Europe preferred go Spain holiday get virus control. really care rest world's response. Accountability critical merely placing blame. initial statement could, vehemently disagree with. start, federal government obstacle overcome, people looking see path forward. major role crisis response providing timely accurate information citizenry act upon. Instead, still witnessing people talk crisis like happening. that's failure leadership, know is. damn wife almost month 9, needed reasons scared shitless  need wear mask danger others. purpose mask prevent spread virus.if one around exist. Making nonsensical outdoor mask policies really going affect anything terms infectivity. make people think rules arbitrary pointless since one well. time man tried lecture doctor job without going education mansplaining. extrapolate situations would covered term. Seems cannot keep Kardashians /s Haha! True! top plastic smell! sneeze didn‚Äôt quite manage get mask for...  Canadian here: $2000 per month March September, lots modified employment insurance - modified much easier qualify.

Also money must stay home due Covid 2 weeks, money must stay home take care someone it, etc.

No big Trudeau fan boy, we're OK. Also hurt they're minority government NDP (SOCIALISTS OMG!!!) always pushed much relief possible. literally complex last guys response. trivialise anti-intellectualism, clever. easy struck court it‚Äôs based science. bad jogging, little challenging lungs get stronger used it. Win Win Like wearing seat belt, even going drive for, like, minute, still put on. Yeah, fuck families feelings, death dignity liberal shit, right?  Sorry. continuing unmasked walks helps mental health. Yea, guess I'm big asshole walking past *maybe* one person within 10 ft mile walk. jog near people. Well, either else cry, way beyond point tragic. Agree.

Maybe that's representative government, instead lawyers got degrees 1965!

Maybe people science degrees 21st century!

The fact everything determined lawyers went school **50 years ago** big part problem! 

A lot millennial nerds know pandemics watched Bill Gates TED talk!  springish, summer soon Almost 20,000 new US cases today last Monday. Whilst agree difficult, people keep misdirecting anger inability work non-action government provide proper support. 

Rather protesting go back work, people protesting government stimulus packages, relief packages. thing government meant do? help citizens times need? (And countries done well helping)

It's far worse go work money, get sick able work huge medical bills. realize banning alcohol would reduce incidents right? like smebody argued gun control chime saying ""You know murdering gun already illegal right?"" SMFH

Sucks get sucker nit-pick analogy.

I gone flu one ""tell parents children died flu!"" Happy now? shut up, man? ""Don't believe stuff people proved, believe stuff child Facebook made up, testing wacky theory"" russia‚Äôs guinea pigs Science says takes 15 minutes close contact infected person, usually indoors, spread it. doesn‚Äôt happen rounding corner suddenly noticing closer 6 feet neighbor split second making way distance.

If going follow science, follow it. requiring masks distance *outdoors* ‚Äúbelief science‚Äù? It‚Äôs terrible overreach plays right anti-maskers‚Äô hands. us everything right still somehow got it? guess package something came left house. Sure Dr. Atlas read one issue keep patients longer hospital complete course treatment (must administered hospital), patient improves earlier would discharged otherwise taking bed... cannot fire government employee, even president ... Outdoors stupid. disagree. live era disinformation. People misled opinions random people irl online flue blabla. People acknowledge respect less politicians say think know truth. systematic problem - countries/regimes people 'forced' believe politicians resolutely, covid control. Many people short minded liberty compromises liberty others. That's big ""if"". ""If"" vaccines cause people stronger, robust immune responses, there's reason continue mandate masking social distancing, will, time, cause damage.

We kept field hospital ready preparation this. COVID-19 nothing healthy 40 year old. It‚Äôs sniffles sore throat. crime people country shafted government. know well attacked China bombs troops US would opened bank response.

Yet 230,000 dead, 30 million unemployed one payment since beginning help. fact unemployed much called losers slackers something control. freaking sick‚Äô  literally called tyranny. Tyranny cruel oppressive government rule. cruel, good.
 
 Oppressive unjustly inflicting hardship constraint, especially minority subordinate group. could onto something causing selfish pricks understand science wear mask outside.



Honestly getting cold, mask gonna keep warm outside. think social distancing stop, measures would, should, continue.

Things like plexiglass stores. Masks hospitals doctor's offices. people may also choose continue wear masks, like China. Contactless food delivery. 

Sports arenas may still filled capacity. bet fans back way. 

But think rapid testing going rolled possible. able test everyone get plane huge. alone could stop spread.

Whatever is, things put place continue. know 6% reported Covid-19 deaths due Covid? right, clearly many people looking loopholes wearing masks should. everything life, ruins everyone else.

So, handle people always pushing boundaries intents rules? make rules simple universal. article:
minus 75 degrees Celsius (-109.3 degrees Fahrenheit) workers warned wear medical gloves longer 10 minutes 

Because increasing probability perforation. note gloves increase vulnerability skin.

No. got wrong. spent good chunk night, probably multiple hours, lecturing doctor infectious diseases. virus made everyone lose damn minds. Fuck people politicized this. shitty mask smell bad breath lol real. Outdoor, fantastic, kind stupid. stopped human beings soon died; physical remains moot. many people earth society continue hoarding bodies; space running out, time consider practical economical methods disposal. Wow feel bad wife. Anyone estimated total many kids got since started? crazy wanted sacrifice kids realize kids future. good money can't leave kids?  vague statements.

What areas talking about, time period? UNITED STATES: whew, nice recovery. AstraZeneca vaccine already 3 billion doses made well.... 70% Americans overweight obese. agree, phrased wrong - read like ""it's surprising. That's we're U.S.""

But fact here? ridiculous. russia‚Äôs guinea pigs worried joke bad taste (so added second line...) I'm glad see someone appreciate it! not-slimy side bar ownership (me, hope), don‚Äôt want fire anyone, none guys want fired, PPP pittance got‚Äôs forgiveness contingent us retaining employees grace period. 

I‚Äôve praying weeks state shuts bars again, way process new batch UI paperwork folks stay safe paid. I‚Äôll also able seek kind rent forgiveness bar‚Äôs landlord case. Right can‚Äôt I‚Äôm stuck- state says open, won‚Äôt exist over. Sucks, man.

We‚Äôve tried turn lemon lemonade situation enforcing masks patrons remaining seated, tell least know community masked they‚Äôre bar, opposed many house parties happened shutdown, idk.

Edit: word courageous... BLM done marching through. wear mask jogging, fair wide range ‚Äòholy shit sucks I‚Äôm breathing mouth‚Äô ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô. regardless, wear masks jogging, go jogging.  One year indefinitely, restrictions gradually eased (except maybe masks public, mass transit, etc.). basically see effective vaccine long takes roll out. know vaccines suit armor, people's immune systems generate antibodies based regular dose? healthcare system give vaccines follow effectiveness antibody test. people ""doesn't take"" typically know so. That's OK, vaccine-prevented diseases already herd immunity keeping up. Covid herd immunity vaccine makes case numbers go near nothing actual nothing, then, yeah, celebrate. Kenney Alberta especially matter bad gets many dying suffering healthcare systems collapse think universal mask wearing public enforced?

What could possibly important? Nope, that's bigger problem. bigger problem? still clear idea reinfection. ""having wear mask similar slavery, Jews trusted WW2. Either understand oppression is"" - guy, november 2, 2020.   funded operation warp speed. Exactly thinking haha. value self sufficiency freedom independence"" yet false sense macho

This fucking explode North/South Dakota. ok ok,first way interpreted it,then tell wrong am

so initial infection covid,you heal good,then takes 6 nonths develop full inmunity,so far simple,doesn't mean theres six month timeframe initial infection catcj again? possibly taking good second go?


again i'm scientist barely know anything viruses alumni college, shocked...just disappointed. Western MDs attitude pandemic whole deplorable. feel bad fellow Bobcats wish best. forced work, we‚Äôre also, literally, social creatures. certain point people snap. coulda knocked months, maybe, are, 7+ months in. Right. forgot part. coronavirus part werewolf? Asking friend. Schools concept ‚Äúcohorts‚Äù try minimize potential spread. Classes split many states reduce class numbers alternating days school teachers locked cohorts someone tests positive entire cohort quarantined tested group. primary schools class teacher teaches children almost subjects cohorts small tight knit. secondary schools subject teachers subject teachers also linked year groups cohorts best possible. long quarantine test process fast effective, shown quite adequately control spread whilst allowing children remain school. It‚Äôs trade think it‚Äôs worked quite well date. can‚Äôt read article (paywall) - indoors outdoors? former, fantastic. Mask requirements indeed enforced **indoors**, outdoors. refuse mask outdoors, always indoors.  /u/HeDiedFourU, /u/Higira, /u/JuicySushi took time correct misgivings. ignoring them? Sample size margin error? so, time man tells someone something, mansplaining? want to? really. 

Is necessary? Yeah, is.

Would accept necessity? Absolutely, unlike virtually everyone else what's right. 

Am selfish enough believe comfort convenience worth spreading virulent killer disease around country? Fuck I'm not, Jesus Christ.

No I'm sarcastic all. I'm responsible. I'm serious. virus care ideology social politics political leanings. nothing meatsuit use spread reproduce. Grow fuck child. Cytokine Storm opening them. Yeah go back posts first wave. smug certain.

lmao texas reopened dumb people like ""Well DEATHS gone problem!!1!"" I‚Äôve come terms getting next year. hoping we‚Äôd able enjoy christmas new years vaccine least celebrate friends I‚Äôve moved that. I‚Äôm happy healthcare workers risk people hopefully get vaccine end year. It‚Äôll relieve lot pressure side knowing I‚Äôm going kill someone‚Äôs grandma. put cart horse. Bush outlawed fetal tissue research. Instead rolling giving up, marvelous scientific community invented new way :) ultra-cold ‚Ä¶ -20c freezers ? I've seen those, used long term storage test specimens. Except crazy people would scream fake try break morgue trailers collect proof covid fake. That's means, all. hospitals capacity, they'll simply resort triage. 20 year old accident victim, they'll let deny care 90 year old COVID victim. That's it, that's that's going happen worst case scenario. twice? Right. actually enforced without sort military state make sure people actually stay homes? doesn‚Äôt seem like rich countries citizens want rushed vaccine . Maybe rest world news?! It‚Äôs basic science. orange meatball caused much damage. mean, fine. good. 

But viruses spread social contact, spooky democrat neighborhood miasma. know schemes well.  Also debt suddenly real concern. BREAKING NEWS: Water fact.... wet. people protesting abolish monarch. I'm jealous! country sucks! strange nickname even me. think MO cave state. *I'm MO shit. Lol sub filled mindless imbeciles pretend ‚Äòbelieve science‚Äô, you‚Äôre pretty damn stupid. Nah lmao  Rural Oregon, that's likely why. one debit card (just got last month, still enter PIN pad) credit card that. 2016, weight education 2020 do. missing /s? could also greatly reduce chance head injury wearing helmet car wear one even though head injuries much common cars compared bikes. People would rather accept risk inconvenienced. wrong. Sweden least acknowledges deadly virus, US actively everything power maximize effect. Wearing simple mask somehow related anti-freedom

What joke, people really fragile nowadays, geez. pure seasonality, wouldn‚Äôt seeing first big spikes starting El Paso, warm climate winter outdoors season summer indoors AC season. doesn‚Äôt though. People already following guidelines wearing indoors outdoors (when proximity others) continue follow rules. make people follow rules extend mask-wearing outdoor spaces they‚Äôre dozens feet away others. It‚Äôs scientifically unsupported, *it won‚Äôt even think will.* I‚Äôm retired nurse. Policy always sneeze cough mask change possible. would never wear mask outdoors, away people, taking daily walk. That's crazy. I'll wear store appease owner store nobody owns outdoors public areas. refuse. That's absurd know ask everyone wear mask ""anywhere."" Nuts! Lol you‚Äôve got point Already many deaths entire 10 year war Vietnam still biggie huh? Many many 9-11 death equivalent counts YAWN huh?

[US Daily vile, I'm going address points someone spewing insults. 

Sorry hear bitter world.  Maybe someone give hug one day.  ever...was people grouped together lengthy period time passing someone street. mention still pressuring schools open state numbers skyrocket. sat back months decided damn thing state level let every town decide handle it. trying ways. people grasp asymptomatic. think long fever/symptoms okay. getting tested weekly work, trying see people also test negative needing likely stay winter. Needing person connection mean I‚Äôd take America sits That's line [CDC guidelines No. question rules self interest anyway. Making rule make less sense get better results. anger people get resentment position.


Try education persuasion instead. that, refrain using phrase wear damn mask idiot. need education Wow cant believe anyone would question leaders experts covid Biden wins = riots, little-to-no unrest

Trump wins (very unlikely) = riots violence, would cool eventually It‚Äôs spreading hot climates like southern Spain El Paso. El Paso‚Äôs outdoor season, summers brutal winters mild. 

We shouldn‚Äôt seeing kind spikes amount mask wearing, sanitation, distancing doing. spikes look like r6, r1.3. point fleeing? Stay fight. Vote bring sanity back! made point, albeit tongue-in-cheek. mask heavy burden we've cowering rule 'no shirt shoes service' time? little corona never hurt nobody, dare track athlete's foot 7-11, guess. think due both.

Look Peru, also peaked August deaths decreased sharply. Peru also 80 000 excessive deaths, assume death rate around 1%, means least 8-10 million people infected 1/3 total population... This, least, brainer. state allows go get ballots sister's family deliver people return polling place.
It called vote agent. relationship people acting agent for. also three times election.  Still, better going polls Covid.  tell people turned 4 ballots election, breaking laws.  Lockdowns first resort onset community spread. Taiwan New Zealand two countries proper reposnse, look New Zealand's second outbreak, soon untraceable cases start pop (community spread) strong local lockdown declared eliminate virus fast possible. early enough regional lockdown 3 4 weeks. New Zealand handled second outbreak achieved elimination second time. Australia position community spread reduced zero. Let's hope quarantine mishaps, strategy take control demonstrated New Zealand. 

If allow rampant virus continue thing eliminate Wuhan style 76 day strict lock down. allow rampant virus continue months national level 8 10 week strict lockdown needed. Australia's 100 day lockdown good example that, also regional. far country rampant national level community spread eliminated virus. see, wait longer lockdown needs be, blows mind countries lockdown properly March. February/Match virus could eradicated matter weeks, 100 days.  

Reopening community spread make sense either, virus 5 times contagious flu, evidence community spread pre-lockdown situation return matter weeks, damaged economy without making progress elimination virus. Partial lockdowns eliminate virus. There‚Äôs still locals southie? thought it‚Äôd pretty gentrified USA high mask adoption rates par European countries higher Britain, Norway, Denmark.

Some Asian countries higher adoption sure lot comes cultural factors. It‚Äôs far normal pre-covid wear mask many Asian countries dealt H1N1 before.

Source Mask adoption: agree overdose deaths terrible pressing matter right, overdoses contagious makes COVID little bit concerning disruptive right now. easily Googled. Covid topics trending searches days. Anyway, here‚Äôs sample.   sub get brigaded right wing bots something? Every comment complaining lockdowns. Curiously, sentence supports arguments. It‚Äôs pointless. done month Spain. It‚Äôs still control. works actually stop events really cause spread, family gatherings. Put malls Schools incubators virus, can't call lockdown open schools. countries learn Australia's experience? seem narrow perspective world.  ever actually met anyone another country?  I'm guessing many Ha ha know much salt come ugly cunt. screams ""please look nobody cares exist look me"". people worried countries lot poor people access basic healthcare. Nobody cares going remote island. something consequence people acknowledge existence. piss bubble. yet outdoor funeral covid positive officiant breezy day resulted dozens infections least one death (other original decedent) area.

Not primary vector even close way spread. Wow! Even Biden wins, that‚Äôs going end. never universal compliance masks lockdowns. going continue doomed policy? TAKE YOU! downvoted it‚Äôs. good point It‚Äôs even breathing/less oxygen; it‚Äôs fucking sweat turning water board experience lied us, Fauci lied less. Biden look better option Fauci. it‚Äôs following trajectory despite mask usage social distancing big chunk population. 

The level precaution place vs March night day. Yet virus spreading like nothing. Wow, coach seems like really great guy. whatever continue impress him. Clearly priorities pandemic order. anxiety taken away me. rule mask always. feeling like I'm silly wearing - rule.

I remember legisilators used make rules. hard cutoff, 5 days test starting get almost sensitive get. says [here . read another link front 5 days exposure. presumably 4 days means assumption traveling day, too. limit free entry people exposed arrived NY, quarantine arrive sick.  real problem BC illicit drug also margins many state polls much bigger last year. much trump loses either florida texas almost called alone. WWI four years. 11~ months. Apples made oranges. virus isn‚Äôt like cold flu required sneezing coughing spread. Covid spread simply BREATHING. Meaning viral load high enough infection breathing alone.  No, sides, go? lot people sub crazy. prevent sneezing ya. gonna sneeze, sneeze mask. Thats made for... heard Tai girls crazier Japanese girls, true? masshole, fucking stupid. comply. breathe fresh air please. Yes must hard government tell people stay house. must involved lot logistics science. . . irony comment... double blind means patients people interacting patients know, 3rd party analyzing data problem people would wear masks mattered politicians coming stupid shit like this. 

This can't nice things like sitting park bench mask it‚Äôs ‚Äúhealthy 40 year-old.‚Äù It‚Äôs idiot‚Äôs older husband 70-year old mother always with. It‚Äôs every person comes contact with, may unlucky enough become acutely ill suffer long-term effects. It‚Äôs one person circle getting sick enough require hospital admission. Take enough ‚Äúhealthy 40 year olds‚Äù like lady, there‚Äôs suddenly long list hospitalizations could avoided grown-ass adult‚Äôs need party like college kid. 

The health system country become overwhelmed everything shutting back down. I‚Äôm healthy 40-year-old know odds getting severely ill Covid relatively low, prefer responsible contribute problem engaging frivolous activities right now.  bring spare masks? meeting get free masks... could say you. Opioid deaths potential overwhelm healthcare COVID absolutely checked. Taiwan number one! didn‚Äôt mean let ü§ß that's American middle class life wtf working class?! depends much spent administration programs. example UK commission brought identify challenge benefit fraud cost run ultimately saved. existing systems efficient cost effective, much. Hmmm, risk $300 fine can't possibly something think silly wear mask? tough choice. one hand, wearing mask mild inconvenience real downsides. hand, inane sense pride surely worth least $300. One biggest issues lifetimes, 59 percent country disapproves, still chance dipshit comes back. Seems unfathomable. I‚Äôve wearing mask since end March. don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm walking dog alley. It‚Äôs on. 

I don‚Äôt get big deal is. agree frostbite shitty smell bad breath. used mask 2 weeks+ (mind you, supposed that) still smell bad lol. Better context data might taking number community cases (2.3k) denominator, means app appears responsible finding 7% confirmed community cases far. rest cases (54.5k) dormitories isolated entire group tested, iirc.  case wondering leave country, lot harder think. 

Ordinarily able dip 6 months, US passport friendly nations. Working remotely possible. borders Canada Mexico shuttered indefinite future, option table. Forgot European nations. There's exceptions (like Croatia, Costa Rica) far between.

Second, developed English-speaking nations tough immigration standards, even there's worldwide pandemic. 

If hoping get work visa (which path residency) foreign nation, usually years education experience in-demand profession also labor pool shortage citizens. places like Canada, New Zealand, Australia, England. impossible, lack training education, tough sell. Even marriage lot tougher used be. 

You ""buy"" residency lot coming nations tourist dependant nations, usually form real estate bringing hefty 6 figure bank account prove financial stability. us live paycheck paycheck that's out. 

The people leaving people substantial advantages-- financial educational. 

If average citizen average education United States, nations want need take you. 

Maybe 5 years we'll able apply refugee status. country control government overreach added mix. Look shape put without it. still nurse, would quit ago shit over. Anyone working directly patient care better person me. saw spikes heat waves people went indoors too. problem people's thinking depending factor ""seasonality"", become factor long winter actually hits. interferon hypothesis, becomes increasingly problematic temperature airways declines body temperature. take cold temperature. means 70F worse 80F 60F worse 70F.

And way, hypothesis would think wearing mask would decrease severity disease infected simply trapping heat in.

And there's dry air hypothesis, UV radiation hypothesis, one mainstream acceptance ""people spending time indoors poorly ventilated environments"". Oh yeah, vitamin status hypothesis too.

all see variability outside ""season"" expense imprisoning 5 million people 4 months virus kills .1% them, call victory? Bingo! Id scared send kids school shootings political inaction following shootings gonna get worse, Island.. walked around outside halloween saw many groups ppl trick treating, children adults masks, groups young people assuming heading parties waiting buses go downtown.. fireworks set everywhere (which loved btw) shit gonna get lot worse.

Scary shit man. change fucking mask like change underwear gets dirty. Yikes! minute scared virus spread daytime. Thank goodness! üòÇ Keep seeing stuff like this, everyday Joe‚Äôs get checked see t-cell immunity. Yeah, lot experience are, they're urban areas. Make smoke cigarette. That's post hoc p hacked effect, almost certainly bogus.

Just watch. going disappear random noise study. cannot fish things way, correcting essentially infinite degrees freedom whatever.

Basically, compare every variable every variable without correcting fact multiple comparisons, guaranteed find something chance. 

They running remdesivir versus corrected probability 100% would impossible get valid result.They literally executed 'how lie stats' chapter multiple times thing. It‚Äôs awesome city visit. great restaurants, museums, course spectacular natural beauty. know could done without mandate. People probably wearing due heat. That‚Äôs guess. mean infected month ago. think I'll fine months then, no? posted couple times already. cloud. AI cloud. Gotta get some. darker humor humane are, according studies. already posted today. realize people spread outdoors right? know White House super spreader event outdoors. Also, masks enforced nationwide. Eventually get places aren‚Äôt bad people still traveling end spreading places masks mandates. Mitch Republicans wanted 500b businesses. Nothing individuals, unemployment aid. bailout corporations. senate stimulus plan stimulus plan people US. Pay attention makes absolutely difference Brazil, graphs show absolutely correlation seasons evolution pandemic Brazil.

But hey, getting better Brazil, must weather, right?

edit: seasons work Brazil: wet summer - summer - dry summer - summer. you‚Äôll get live like North Dakota right now. hospitals don‚Äôt room new people. sound fun me. I‚Äôll lobby politicians enact restrictions. Also Belgian here. comment gold. Thank explaining country unbiased way. I'm going use explain country. someone could look good clickbait titles. stupid.

like ppl see driving themsrkves wearing mask wish hell state would pull head collective ass pass exact law here. actually officials trying ban masks here. need exceptions excuses exemptions law Nationwide we're going get control. really big deal wear mask. I've wearing one since March anytime I'm outside home. barely even noticed I'm wearing anymore. day get vaccinated able get vaccinated, privilege president.""


Seems like take becomes available others country. Haha, confirmed. Well good thing don‚Äôt live I‚Äôd giving running permanently. That's going much. Many tried approach failed. learn states/countries repeat mistakes end full lockdown? Yes, vote, even Republicans. Anyone else feel like 2021 summer Olympics going postponed again? Personally carry backup mask situations like that. yeah, worked operating rooms, sterile gown gloves, sometimes let mucous ride. scientifically proven virus spread night.

What going stop small gatherings family friends?

Are businesses getting anything compensation closing early?  Indoors outdoors, regardless social distancing, regardless whether alone, public wearing mask. Inside buildings unless house public. exceptions excuses. medical religious exemptions, printed cards say violation Rights, bullshit excuse well minute whatever. Wear mask outside house. law Boston now. Yet went RMV today counter happened called employee wasn‚Äôt wearing mask. Surely everyone listen though Man goalposts. ‚Äúmight‚Äù chance run somebody like ‚Äúmight‚Äù spread flu grandma hit pothole collide car next you. Ah, true. usually go early, many folks out! Trump well. Credit credit due. trick getting doses everyone. Many even *want* vaccine.

Not mention vaccines need constantly stored temperature -20C lower, making extremely difficult distribute. idiots believe too.

Sadly underlying health conditions CoVID19 takes advantage prevalent America.  Thank input. Also, saved lot lives saved people getting infected spending time ICUs, hospitals overwhelmed etc. think success! I‚Äôm Slovak live USA wanted ask - think much opposition Slovak people testing? Honestly, wish something like here, US seems like gave fighting corona virus ...  Finally, someone taking reasonable measures, instead requiring people wear masks can't keep 6 ft distance. Distancing matter virus spread aerosols. enough enough

Yeah viruses care that. passed stimulus plans side wouldnt pass it. One side wanted spend alot couldnt agree. say one side fault bias. done something neither side wanted compromise. Why? likely totally fine. Likely never show single symptom. guy gets it. No, im living college educated ucla graduate lawyer started making take clothes shower march,,to someone barely wear plastic face shield. sure hydroxicloradine zinc cheap effective, big pharma forcing pharmacists filling this. got job paying insurance claims get away this. go nuts. co workers idiots, taking masks desk, dick nose, even wearing anything, young people. notice one b.a. gone week, good her. wear mask everywhere. I'm also taking vitamin d, zinc, name it. YES. excuses exceptions. means kid scooter, walking dog. Read article. Especially part says exceptions excuses multiple times. Basically public wearing mask. England things almost back normal without vaccine understand (I live Wales rules strict). People could go pubs, resturants other's houses without masks (limit 6 people later brought in). could shop without mask. real restrictions keep 2m away strangers (which hard enforce probably constantly broken even without realising) mass events.

I cannot see harsher vaccine. also concern long term effects. literally obvious within 15 minutes remdesivir bogus, internet calling since minute one.

CNBC hyped remdesivir cure hour half market open, claiming statistically valid results. really janky p table literally page break it. Literally first chapter uni stats lie stats lmao, put page break p table.

The results significant, p hacked post hoc variable month later. dumbass peanut gallery internet 10 steps ahead BS. 

Yes, people really get news comments sections days. Agreed. fair. fulfilling you, however different people different priorities.

I opposite side taking care six year old boy. kid basically risk virus willing let isolated lonely childhood order ensure deaths disease average death age 80.  Statistically no. then...? get Kanye speak subject anyone else look sharp rise last 2 weeks think ‚Äúthat huge anomaly‚Äù, explained sudden covid fatigue?

I 90% sure new strain Spain MUCH infectious - (or another mutation) made way US.  guess I‚Äôm a-hole also then. I‚Äôm willing go full bore, semblance it. Smaller classes start with. Schools? Lock Yeah, actually prefer version ambiguity. I'm always torn go walks outside usually deserted street. feel like mask there's nobody around I'm overprotective silly. also makes nervous. see someone I'm constantly judging I'm close (even I'm clearly 50 feet away).

Now, anxiety taken away me. rule mask always. feeling like I'm silly wearing - rule. Sounds like lockdown effective*

*at seeding virus country Thousands fines day live mask non-compliance. There's dedicated task force. 


They definitely better things do. important. coronavirus, re-infections usually possible e.g. (common cold) year (SARS-1) 4 years. I'd agree 6 months early side statistics. I'd subscribe strategy depending Covid immunity beyond year, especially since we're close guess reading articles internet trumps medical degrees lmao. Come dude, married doctor, can't clueless. one crazy‚Äôs American 

Source: live FL Sure, -

It takes 10% population sitting get sustained recession. 10% gets sustained depression. Spot lol believe low risk. However, also believe risks elevate stood one place full conversation 15 minutes face face. understand simple it. Masks stop spread virus, I've told trying break work controlled environment everyone wears one every situation helpful makes look pedantic.

I'm speaking someone direct experience mandatory mask society whereas likely zero experience. They're called long-term effects yes basically discover them. wait observe definition cannot know show up.

We know post-covid heart damage either. one alone's gonna shorten lifespans far couple people yes may bring sudden death month 12 due myocarditis pericarditis.

Also Sweden skyrocketing come herd immunity bullshit. important thing make sure virtue signalling? difference one pretends idiot. wearing everywhere, see someone 20-30 feet away. That‚Äôs point is. I'm - Charlie done good job winless Carona war thus far imho......unfortunately indoor dining still menu...see thing is....when reopened indoor dining long ago ""crushed"" curve. result , uptick cases aprox 2 weeks later. fully understand favorite restaurants endangered species.....but global data - indoor dining risky pleasantry infection probability increase ten fold (obviously depending sq "" , air/lack circulation etc....this may play Charlie, hospitals, patient recovery keep uptick cases. best answer tuff difficult scenario???? I'm sure plenty step reddit verse Okay, speed reading, trials ? ‚Äú things ‚Äú ? Sorry, skeptical hopeful. going hear praise masks even woods mandate. think incredible governmental overreach. comes safety ultimately responsibility. want wear masks woods that's fine. want live basement next three years avoid chance human contact, that's also decision. guy lecturing doctor risks find acceptable, that's insane me. one medical degree, he's reading articles internet. one think actually knowledgeable covid works? never said hoax ""plandemic"" i'm sure makes defeatist asking people argue statistics statistically consistent manner. ""More murder rate"" mean shit murder rate like handful per 100,000 people. That's whole lot fucking room interpretation... fact immediately assume I'm covid-hoax pushing Trumpist whole fucking problem goddamn state political discourse country. cast ballot Biden last week, Trump's absolutely abysmal handling Covid btw complete shitter. second think doctor wife probably good enough idea risk involved need husband explain her.  asking questions they've answered?

Edit: yeesh.  Testing 12-15 year olds seems ethically questionable me. 16-17 year olds... eh, know, maybe. hard know draw line. least first cohorts guess. makes bit better. else though? China doesn‚Äôt cooperate can‚Äôt get source. Kinda reminds argumentative essays highschool.

""Too much freedom never good country. far agree?""

And America definitely honeypot examples. poisonous ignorance makes sad. angry. Sangry. NONE clue fuck talking about.  zero comparison murderous traitor scientist 50+ years experience field. media profits fear, it‚Äôs simple that. People known many months effectiveness T-cells COVID-19 infections turn vaccinations, yet media would rather cover antibodies. that's hospitals overwhelmed well. Mortality predicted go several countries trends continue. fucking fear day find brand new virus symptoms like permanent hearing loss, seizures, migraine headaches, etc.  attitude country start. Since covid-19 taken seriously first place, hard people take seriously despite obvious consequences. want know frankly, I'm.hoping they're reeling defeat hard tomorrow never open fucking mouths gain. brilliant. Hope works. I'm impressed compliance. honestly hesitate asked (I'm American) I'm sorry else 50+ years experience field? can't. make sense close peak hours rather dead hours? People definitely going cautious get vaccine start interacting people again, hopefully subside quickly. 

I think start beginning worry effects past year people. Coming people going battling addictions mental health problems. refused needed yes, vast majority people right thing. one's gonna win right Fucking obviously. Fauci's doctor, Trump brainless sack shit.

I trust Trump find way cliff he'd pushed. I‚Äôll assume commenting good faith (i.e. really believe you‚Äôre saying) prove otherwise. snark me, honest answer, also benefit anyone else reading this.

Re chewing gum:

There law says chewing gum punishable caning. consumption chewing gum is, fact, punishable idea enforcing law would laughable case (any volunteers Mouth Patrol?) 

The law made regards *importing selling* chewing gum (under Regulation Imports Exports act), punishable fines imprisonment. here‚Äôs context: laws regarding chewing gum made 1992, made absolutely pragmatic reasons explain (I know this, - fellow Singaporeans check this).

Singapore started running trains first time 1987. big, BIG deal; first form massive public transport (beyond buses) would completely transform lives. There‚Äôs way over-exaggerate this.

Then idiots started putting gum door sensors. Train doors couldn‚Äôt close, trains stuck basically whole line would paralysed. doesn‚Äôt sound like big deal consider small Singapore - whole train network two lines, barely drop contemporary train networks London, Tokyo, DC etc. shutdown effect bit akin large-scale terrorist attack, terrifying thing *anyone bit chewing gum could it.*

Incidents far nobody could afford let happen. Culprits hard catch gum littering also widespread issue, PM time decided ban chewing gum imports instead, figuring could cut supply could minimise cases. complaining, us experienced firsthand effects train delays didn‚Äôt really object (mostly, thinking, ‚Äúscrew gum-assholes‚Äù).

A years later negotiation Wrigley‚Äôs, Singapore government decided allow therapeutic dental (teeth whitening) chewing gum. buy pharmacies today.

To conclude subject chewing gum, Singaporean: most, all, us don‚Äôt give much damn chewing gum. anyone really craves gum reason doesn‚Äôt want buy stuff pharmacies, Malaysia twenty minute ride across causeway. idea locking waiting vaccine seems less reasonable potential vaccine is.

We're getting goaded idea extending restrictions years dangle carrot vaccine front us.

Boiling frog, etc.. Hmmmmmmm maybe pay better attract nurses, instead cutting salaries.  majority people get offended online masks lockdowns actually US citizens users agenda multiple accounts, people drinking yellow Trump kool aid getting offended insulted lord savior disagreeing knowing one. No, fuck her. infectious. depends empty field not. dont public space people spread it.  careful lot proven dupes filtered next nothing. met standards needed category Sounds promising! feel hoe want going censor say. August 3rd, 2019 white supremacist walked Walmart shot bunch people. (Mainly Mexicans) Look, soapbox adorable champ there, shut fuck wear mask, deal consequences. care individually responsible enough social distance, individually smart enough know need wear mask to. 

The laws road everyone, regardless good driver are. get special license says ""this guy handle multitasking okay he's talking phone"" ""this guy professional driver nice car we'll speed limit him"". work like that. 

We tried nice. tried allowing people use judgement safe without mandates. work - people idiots. One surges fucking FITCHBURG, morons church ""left Jesus"" wear masks socially distance service.

So, yup. Wear mask outside. Period. month move together. don't, pay fines/get arrested. move. know country going following suit soon enough Biden takes over. qualify Gold Card Nurse? Cool story, Hansel. god that‚Äôs insane. side STREET. Yeah, that‚Äôs 7.3x10^-5 precent reinfection rate, incredibly small really shouldn‚Äôt even talking it. require sacrifices anyone.

Unfortunately according Americans wearing mask worst thing since slavery. dude. editor's note fucking top article straight says writers agree article anymore.

*Editor‚Äôs Note: article published April 1, 2020, NEJM.org. letter editor June 3, 2020, authors article state ‚ÄúWe strongly support calls public health agencies people wear masks circumstances compel within 6 ft others sustained periods.‚Äù* Seems bit silly likely make people give up.

I live big city, always mask outside home. people suburbs that? rural areas walk one within fifty feet them? think busy mounting legal defenses .. they're panicked fucked, across board. four months living working home, alternative live, New covid infections 16,000 deaths. **That's 6.5% mortality rate**. stick health advice sun shine. Considering cases seem trending up, seems demonstrably clear people *not* good social distancing measures.  Guys okay. We're rounding corner. Played stupid games, winning stupid prizes  ""you people""? think /u/KazROFL saying we're getting cheeks clapped people duhn duhn, cap. stuff sounds like common sense me? Trump lost popular vote.  None polls actually account electoral college. lack critical thinking comments unbelievable. bet French thrilled already accepted norm China wear masks public pre-pandemic, due extremely high air pollution. one cared. Completely normal boring shit. Wearing masks also common enough H1N1 - handed free one clinic diagnosed, 10 years ago. handed free mask - said wear get anyone sick. wore it. one gave shit.

Its feels weird today, yes, politized. really, people bristle made wear masks. think hard pressed find anyone gives fuck (someone else) wears one.

It feel weird though. first walked street burbs mask, half suspected someone driving pickup truck going yell something me. happen though.

No one really gives shit. wearing mask global pandemic. masses smart enough 100 years ago. think even anti maskers would hard pressed actually give someone shit choosing wear mask pandemic. think about, really would quite low also aggressive move. much I'd stunned actually ever happened. did, cares.

You gotta go ""who gives shit"" side scenario. can't something reasonable like wearing mask pandemic due reason social pressure, future scenarios similarly going make poor choice, yourself, reason perceived social pressure? Gotta learn say fuck to. Let reason prevail chimp brain. good things happen.

PS. makes feel better. thought read somewhere people wearing masks perceived better social graces. So, beyond reasonableness terms safety - also display good manners, sorts. signal courteousness passersby. feel good that.

EDIT: clearer. aware social pressure sorts burbs. small feeling wearing mask possibly somewhat odd unusual. slight social discomfort. That's really judge anyone see walks maskless. keep distance, yes, wear mask, judge. know social pressure there. -- important part: feel like REASON slight social pressure wearing masks burbs majority wearing them. reason majority wearing slight social pressure wearing them, majority wearing them.. etc etc.

So answer? say fuck mask anyways. Eventually people wear (in burbs) becomes normalized, reducing ""self consciousness factor"" zero. burb's rates drop / stay low everyone ride thing healthy peace. Go town. possible self-consciousness feel burbs wearing mask? means gotta one get mask norm started. AKA reason slap mask front door daily stroll. fair, people charge first fleet England stand shore Sydney harbour 40¬∞C heat (104¬∞F) thought ""This must winter feels like here"". time fine. I‚Äôm super annoyed seems blanket mask order necessary tho agree is. 

When I‚Äôm neighborhood easily stay 50+ feet away anyone shouldn‚Äôt mask up. 

But stupid fucks seem think outside complete shield crows hell up. many people don‚Äôt wear masks crowded outdoor areas No, what's pushed going work less dangerous going work bars. Going work windows open less dangerous leaving closed. distance better. airflow better. Etc. 

We could much better place using every mitigation tool. Instead washing hands wearing underwear face. I'm sorry what's point wearing mask? bother fiddling constantly wear forget it?  Sorry, qualify found posted said ""didn't fever anymore."" Last night 10 pm though clearly said one. big boss heard say anything last night morning.

I'm sure fever checks morning know actually fever-free. know sure is, 24 hours since broke. ya like half steps make solution lol Numpty?? Yikes.

I read article still easy see url mentions cost-benefit analysis article = 0

From **Key * Public health policies combat SARS-CoV-2 mostly rely models designed predict * models often ignore potential harms arise performance cost-benefit analyses article = 0

Such thing outside scope article - point one needs made, trivially, cannot without looking 'cost' article really tell us anything new. basically intellectualised ""lockdown bad"", absent critical interrogation concept railing productive suggestions alternatives, ""we've got get lot different people thinking it"".

Disingenuous take. author discusses costs ranging across variety domains cites evidence support them. think description costs incorrect, need say why. peer-reviewed btw.

Can imagine pro-lockdown stuff sub we're painted similarly blunt unmeasured cynicism? upshot here? think *should* ignoring lockdown-related costs? know difference. freaking heart. Apparently give shit, long *statistically insignificant*.

Without them, country would seriously come end. extra 600 per week ended july. think. extra 3/400 weeks summer. pandemic unemployment benefits. applied might still able to. rights stupid? Right aid killing people making sick?


Why like this? even typed /s.


This fucking people swear. do! High rate outside, everyone inside. Greater Boston though, sure rural western mass same. certain things definitely want decide others I'd rather not.

For example, many nights work care we're dinner. Husband pick. long calories I'm allergic, I'm good.

The decision whether send daughter back school person keep virtual - super glad decision could make.

When glad government making decision I'm torn right decision, especially instinct one thing safer also silly time. someone else power make decision favor ""it's silly, it"" side makes feel lot better. vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt go?  Except parents kid anymore. Please kind a$$hole. shit? NJ, schools barely open. However, second leading cause cases? Daycares. small groups. running like normal? school classes size? Much different story. 

My town two half days per cohort Week A. everyone virtual next two weeks. shit cases. vaccine pump dumping still hero? look CDC Website natural introvert finds relieving, hard time empathy front. I'd feel sympathy acting outright dangerous day day life. Like I'm seriously afraid asking put mandatory masks work 100% see coming back gun shooting us all. people refusing mentally stable people first place. national level, totally true.

On local level.... live Seattle area. couple major, well-publicized outbreaks pretty early (a nursing home first major outbreak US choir practice first documented superspreader event). cities, counties, state governments *do* people past traditional retirement age, [IHME](http://www.healthdata.org/), group local university making projections based statistics epidemiology modeling.

So nerds board process. although descend sheer crazy denialism, still end going well hope. press state government treated projections IHME gospel... public got pissed infection numbers match projections. county government made wishy-washy announcements amounted ""uh, guess let's stay home another two weeks"" every two weeks while.

I think best answer time would flat-out say ""We actually know long going take. We've got guesses based IHME guys say, still lot ways could go... could take year."" guess shows another part issue this: people government afraid say ""we know"" public willing hear ""we know"". Like old saying goes kids germ factories, likely get sick show less symptoms recover spreading. responding saying impacting exercise isn‚Äôt valid excuse. think people it‚Äôs iffy excuse actual distance runners training right mask make huge difference mileage pace, good one. I‚Äôm never closer 10 feet anyone wide trail go it‚Äôs moot tbh Thailand pretty much day one. ifs buts. course know much masks contributed fact local transmissions anymore quite time even though first cases outside China Bangkok popular oversea destination tourists Wuhan. ""island bonus"" either, borders open quite time. establishes baseline: leave house put least pants, shirt mask, rest optional. never debate it.

Now free talk additional measures masks given cost nothing require sacrifices anyone. rights stupid? Right aid killing people making sick? 61,000 children get covid from, last week? post removed because:

I'd surprised takes less 8 months get 95% immunisation population.

I confidently expect Australia reach 95% immunisation rate free vaccines, free cheap doctor consults, government tying family tax credits immunisation certificates.  government tied tax credits immunisation response reappearance community transmission measles Australia, least 80% anti-vaxxer parents got children immunised.

I'm confident first available vaccine prevent risk people getting covid19 completely. I'm risk.

To avoid part group people get unexpectedly damaging new vaccine, intend wait 3 months seek available vaccine. definitely intend get vaccinated whether merely lowers seriousness illness, prevents entirely, lowers chance getting instead preventing entirely.

So I'm planning wear mask roughly 10 months now. I'm going looking 95% vaccination rate, herd immunity kicks known illnesses far. (Measles difficult, aerosolised virus requires rate immunisation herd immunity).

I'll looking news herd immunity reached Australia even 95% immunisation. would bonus.

I'll looking news coronavirus community-to-community infection continues eliminated Victoria, Australia. I'll stop wearing mask that's within rules currently lifted steady stages. I'm going start wearing mask cold sickness. I've found coughing sneezing mask comfortable effective.  hand reflexively flies face, landing mask. 

I'll looking news covid19 started circulating community despite everyone received first available vaccine. would send back mask wearing.

I'll looking new better vaccines that, repeat Victoria's successful lockdown elimination.  

I'm wary Australia opening travel entire world world collectively better control pandemic. would prefer stay travel bubble nations in-community transmission. point people start taking seriously, may well sooner. trend terrible. dad doesn‚Äôt even trust Fox News. thinks even biased Trump. fuck care Americans think? 30-something percent voting idiot dumber are. rather cathartic play devils advocate.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Limited information suggests pregnant women COVID-19 might increased risk severe illness compared nonpregnant women.

**What added report?**

In analysis approximately 400,000 women aged 15‚Äì44 years symptomatic COVID-19, intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death likely pregnant women nonpregnant women.

**What implications public health practice?**

Pregnant women counseled risk severe COVID-19‚Äìassociated illness including death; measures prevent infection SARS-CoV-2 emphasized pregnant women families. findings inform clinical practice, risk communication, medical countermeasure allocation. called Canadian Emergency Response Benefit apply government website (and channels, sure else) work resulting workplace closing via lockdowns. personally use it, know people due industries work fairly simple application process. Ultimately government identify took advantage without needing clawback tax season again, personal experience I'm sure work. corner. circle. üòû in: Everyone ever died corona virus nursing home patient NY  found N95 20 $40 People live really believe. I‚Äôm slowly learning businesses support anymore seeing ones aren‚Äôt requiring masks. went gas station yesterday immediately regretted masked person dozen patrons employees. Got tf fast could won‚Äôt back. Based ‚Äúbecause said so.‚Äù That's point: bring chance encounter someone. I'm wearing one walk empty street, bullshit. See someone coming sidewalk ahead? I'll put - ABSOLUTELY NEED one alone. country called Slovakia pretty fast get lot total noncompliance half hearted compliance. *Steal childhood*? That's **rich**. 

Do know steals childhood? Developing autoimmune disease knowingly exposed virus triggers it. See: CDC guidance MIS-C. 

Do know else steals childhood? teen who's Covid long hauler, monitored cardiac symptoms. 

Do even children? did, would know can't make childhood perfect. best raise kind empathetic towards others **towards adulthood**. 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Pregnant women SARS-CoV-2 infection increased risk severe illness compared nonpregnant women. Adverse pregnancy outcomes preterm birth pregnancy loss reported.

**What added report?**

Among 3,912 infants known gestational age born women SARS-CoV-2 infection, 12.9% preterm (&lt;37 weeks), higher national estimate 10.2%. Among 610 (21.3%) infants testing results, 2.6% positive SARS-CoV-2 results, primarily born women infection delivery.

**What implications public health practice?**

These findings inform clinical practice, public health practice, policy. important providers counsel pregnant women measures prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. should, anyone sane fucking scary, can't tell bots writing not. 1984? go finish show start moshing anger instead jubilation.  car yells put on, didn‚Äôt realize moving car driveway thus didn‚Äôt seatbelt on. It‚Äôs neat feature. Damn. Canada, shut down, got $500 per week. Literally signed it, received money next day. ongoing weeks ago, another supplement kicked hours still cut back. take it, job affected, know quite people CERB (Canadian Emergency Response Benefit). know always one kid class ruined chances pizza party... Well there's one every class. every grade. every school... on. asymptomatic cases contagious , seems impossible keep everyone safe without kind home based testing.

I guess might possible isolate elderly family members risk adults teens, don‚Äôt know long maintained long would work kids. Nobody long distance running supermarket though. people talking saying ‚Äúexempt‚Äù UK people don‚Äôt want wear masks public indoor settings, extent rules cover mask usage here. I'm sorry feel way. hope get mental health help need Yeah even won‚Äôt permanent. two weeks bend curve bullshit? allow small business crumble deprive kids in-person education 2 fucking years?! That‚Äôs insanity. Nine. yeah, I'm totally rejecting this. That's ridiculous. 

Sorry posted comment. regret it. think like ‚Äúshould put seatbelt? I‚Äôm going across road. car less five minutes... worth inconvenience silly?‚Äù matter distance there‚Äôs still always chance something crazy happen seatbelt useful. may 0.00000001% (made example number obviously, idea frequency car accidents short trips) time it‚Äôs still best practice wear every time get car think us would agree that.

Pack dry ice 10 day shelf life. good another 5 days fridge. overnight shipping sit pharmacy doctor's office almost 2 weeks used. critical care nurse 4 years long work hospital because... guessed it, got Covid early pandemic. I‚Äôm lucky go regular walks without crippling chest pain asthma attacks. used work least hour spending rest day feet caring full care patients. It‚Äôs morally distressing skill help physically cannot. know nurses like lot nurses quitting leaving medicine entirely due pandemic.

This country go every medical professionals worst nightmare: mass casualty protocol. part yes. enclaves compliance drops general we‚Äôve pretty good. said people still known wear incorrectly still work progress. Girls want fun. much disease control, guess... /facepalm  meant create buzz find new job. Hey asshole, people exist risk want keep mental health walking outdoors too. Wear fucking mask. doubt police enforce though, like indoor rules businesses ask leave. really stupid policy. Republicans can't even right thing right. Except literally evidence supporting need people outside need mask  hell time day anything! ""political,"" human beings' daily lives political. mentioned political party politician. advocated neither side upcoming election. raised issue people even know exists, touches thousands people, sides political spectrum. Someone asks ""what US even closed"" point closure national borders foreigners except exceptions means thousands families loved ones indefinitely kept apart sense ever see again? I'm sorry, that's ""political""? population Canada 37 million lol, compared US , besides people live cities, US far larger rural areas 300 million , better still comparisons pointless. people say ""nobody around"" still run less 6ft person pass huffing puffing maskless wear them. 

Not saying personally. personal experience people gotten far closer 6ft without mask, running county mandates masks unless remain least 6ft away. I'm sure mind think they're fine nobody prove closer 6ft, reality they're running slower people spraying tons droplets pass around here. wear mask even they're 6ft away get claim innocence ambiguous zone inhabit make parks trails unusable people want jerks spraying droplets can't bothered either wear mask stay away people. know that's supposed even mean, sure something they've made up? rich countries signed agreement share, Trump's America.  Replying people ""this bs"" helping change point view.

People told stay home wont go check doctor often. That's miss diagnosis non-covid diseases. news water wet Oh pal...the GOP reason don‚Äôt sleep night :( Yeah. think many people don‚Äôt spare bedroom bathroom safely tuck possible infection away. child it‚Äôs even difficult. 

I remember reading something back March creating room divider duck tape tarp. don‚Äôt know practical solution would be. 

I know portable commodes someone still needs clean empty it. gets fired well work canada. Minimum PHD 30yrs field entry level job tho. people might move Americas. Nothing rly imposed really hope normalize wearing chill clothes work eventually  Triage normal sense deciding sickest treating first. sort triage talking figure likely survive leaving die. medical professionals never make decision. precisely intent order: it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous, *is* simple, allegedly goal. really stupid.

Part age. Part behavioral.

We're fat countries though, I'm pretty sure UK identical proportions overweight obese. point? March year? first. 

I reply comment saying ""Oh, feel sad sick kids"". 

I bet also one dudes goes: ""Well, statistically, go school bound die school shooting."" 

Who ever feel sad for, yourself? people check 538's game predictions March Madness get idea truly likely unlikely outcomes are. 30% chance winning close enough coin toss notice difference watching games. 10% chance winning minor upset. still trust election forecasts, I've seen many teams 10% chance winning pull upset feel sense complacency. People take seriously dead bodies street, even doubts preaching shit. fact reasons called guy he's bought crazy fear levels he's lecturing doctor wife stay safe based articles he's read internet. everything teams, go make fun idiots idiots matter team on. president blame lol, changing president would change things ? According some, tomorrow Coronavirus magically go away. guess we‚Äôre finally find they‚Äôre right. spamming website? Ivermectin used deworming sheep. sure that‚Äôs gonna help Rona. piece shit keeps spamming this. banned yet? Quit spamming pay real advertising  fail math. Freudian slip position it, encourage sick people go polls.  It‚Äôs close US per capita deaths. sure smaller country makes non disaster let one 1690 whole population die. Norway let one 18600 population die. It‚Äôs older people dying everywhere doesn‚Äôt make comparison better. girlfriend positive. live 1 bedroom together. family telling still quarantine eachother, risk getting viral pneumonia high hang close proximity. want either us end locked 8x10 bedroom 2 weeks avoid it. anyone know do? understand virus could worse near other.

CDC seems info avoiding virus 1 person household it. ad?  trying hard opposed nothing? working out? All-in-all evidence indicates children spread *this* virus like wildfire, late-adolescent - twenties crowd spread virus (not represents moral failing part).

It however [important children exposed worry lost lockdown hysteria paradigm shift year means we'll see people keep kids bubble-wrap even well covid ceases pandemic. ridiculous. I‚Äôm wearing one alone walk. near people spread corona them. nonsensical goal post moving. Fuck that. People usually wear masks outside downtown boston. sucks it‚Äôs lot better alternative (rapid spread without leadership responsibility)  What? Literally everyone keeps log times. watch assuming comment coming someone doesn‚Äôt live Mass won‚Äôt deal law?

... I‚Äôve lived 20+ years wearing mask every time stepped outside even fucking Fauci realized useful.  One HS closed week near 5th 6th grade middle school notice infection letters sent home today.


Mount Laurel NJ area middle school, HS one town over. she?  I‚Äôm walking sidewalk don‚Äôt wear mask people come near pass way I‚Äôm overtaking someone I‚Äôll put I‚Äôm close take back soon they‚Äôre 6-10ft away again. Seems pointless wear mask isn‚Äôt anyone close enough give covid to/catch from. It‚Äôs uncomfortable reason. think anti-maskers idiots seems like Government overreach medical benefit. make law like substantial scientific evidence back effectiveness stop? People eventually going get pissed told draw line. convincing. made illegal wear one. Thats convincing, thats forcing. misunderstand seasonality. Gov Noem prosecuted. exhausting. Well could take number examples. Lets look one single chain tho. start lockdowns....then get president posting ""free michigan""....then get armed protests....then get armed counter protests....then somehow side step blm protests....then get people running protesters cars....then get buncha ppl planning storming capital. Inbetween abuses power one side, looting other....while media sides drooling next wild story get clicks. meantime political leaders whipping respective bases frenzy everything might get votes push get favorite issue moving.

All pushed point police actively abandoning positions, governors sueing mayors, states attempting pass laws limit legal ramifications running people down, people actively attacking streets whether wear mask durring pandemic. CDC fucked initial tests. FDA blocked labs using self-developed tests weeks. Fuck off. 

Signed, left leaning biden voter. Turning coroner. Oops used keyword modbot like. There's certain political group believes anti Semitic conspiracy theories rebranded involving Q refuse wear masks openly fantasize shooting people. certainly frighten me. Short answer, yes. Well, fact crowded masks reduce virus transmission. Common sense dictates citizens follow safety rules voluntarily, need made enforceable regulations.

I like it, I'd prefer mask directive total lockdown.

If dont day 1, situation.

&amp;#x200B;

In town, we've 100% mask while. Likely many asymptomatics even included count.  think rule broad deal use loophole. 

As people keep pointing out, course issue. outside *alone* dog (and practice fined) -- issue people use ambiguity wear mask busy street, passing close people. 

It happens everywhere, many people, runners, etc wear masks passing within one feet you. likely many people thread claiming ""always keep 10 feet running"" actually odd times party gets slightly busy, kind neglect mention argue matter. Yea everyone says don‚Äôt reduce O2 levels believe still fucking sucks working one. get goddamn hot Hey, so, used run, used swim. Reaching point you‚Äôre breath quickly trains blood cells anaerobic work. time means body less oxygen. It‚Äôs running sucks shape, gets easier time.

Olympic athletes actually train masks specifically cause effect, take off, bodies able work much effectively ‚Äúincreased‚Äù oxygen levels exercising without mask. 

If point training you‚Äôre serious enough keep log times, already know this. C‚Äômon man. excuses. People would absolutely smash China human rights violation locked became pandemic.

Pandemics existed china, long ago. china give fk human rights Vietnam probably swiftest, locking two months earlier (before first fatality) Thailand (first Covid outside China) New Zealand.

NZ locked Vietnam (late march vs early april), trivial validate this. probably try (validating opinion) talk have. No, also hospitalizations. think forget Italy's Spain's systems overwhelmed point care rationed. happened yet round, thankfully.

Also, reported missed 95% cases back Spring. testing apparatus essentially non-existent back then, believe it. naked public shit running legs? Yeah, stores area open 24/7 anymore. really sucks since always work closing shift work. :( Oh? speak Americans?  Lol know one two would disagree.  Youd probably embarassment presumptuous well.

Also, youre country google facebook.  Seems like many okay tracked long corporation profit..  draw line public health? odd don‚Äôt know right place put this, ELI5 need but: surely shipping people Russia would thorough screening shipping (no pun intended) another country? border exemption bit cheeky reckon. There‚Äôs nothing normal times. Virus there. can‚Äôt bargained with, can‚Äôt reasoned with. feels pity, remorse. absolutely stop, *ever!* we‚Äôre inoculated. I‚Äôm excited watch predators real promising person make second round we‚Äôre lucky chances walking past someone outside 10 feet away, matter temperature, contracting COVID almost zero. No.  sobering read. majority Americans vote POTUS, tomorrow. Screw term, ""selfish"". People miss living normally like I. I'm hoping theaters open fully next spring. people keep pointing out, course issue ,. outside *alone* (and practice fined) -- issue people use ambiguity wear mask busy street, passing close people. 

It happens everywhere, many people, runners, etc wear masks passing within one feet you. likely many people thread claiming ""always keep 10 feet running"" actually odd times party gets slightly busy, kind neglect mention argue matter.

Now might say there's enough studies show 1 feet exposure outside puts high risk, there's certainly evidence possible. 61k children get covid, then? bar? Would prefer stay home vote? Everyone right go &amp; vote. know friends though, don‚Äôt local friends. One friends side state moved different country moved states times. blood clots? Exactly right Yes matter. Statistics matter. Probability matters. manage risk every single day. 

What letting emotion run thought process, sure fire way ruin entire generation children. virtue signaling steroids. Definitely depends city in, I'm sure. I've seen enough people complaining across multiple cities towns know still problem state. numbers lie.  r/nottheonion curious found [an details garbage bin elevator button cases. thisiswhathappenswhenthepresidentoftheunitedstatesgolfsfortythreetimessincejanuary people?!? seem find real life?? can‚Äôt find science states wear mask times even people aren‚Äôt near you.  really care politics president. remember username was? ""present\_dweller"" main spammer one showed twice. care ""shamed"" local busybodies. care facts common sense.  remember username was? ""present\_dweller"" main spammer one showed twice.  carry passengers, especially elderly children, wear mask driving. alone, going pick passengers, wear mask. Unfortunately happens virus deep population. adults back office POTUS wished for. What? Also Boston, obviously looking around well enough. People wearing masks wearing properly indoors outdoors place. selfish state rest country, need enforced. worry, Baker balls force cities towns actually enforce like start. scientific sub like this. tried political sub like r/conservative? Science support you, political opinions sure will. wearing mask inside picture? Ok vast majority folks climbing 13ers, they‚Äôre walking sidewalks near people. folks don‚Äôt wear mask don‚Äôt make effort keep 6 feet away they‚Äôre passing people. support rule leaves room confusion whether need wearing mask situation situation. answer always ‚Äúyes.‚Äù 

And yes, wear mask hike, walk, cycle. No, it‚Äôs comfortable, it‚Äôs law live. people unstable unless live toxic city. I'm introvert like are, I'm scared. Seems like social anxiety. children wear masks drinking bars?  ain't gonna win; already imagine ends. upvotes? wrong every part every sentence. 90 year old COVID patient already dead his/her spot already given 20 year old covid patient triage. 

How hospitals decide now? Deny care 20 year old covid patient 20 year old accident victim? resources save both.  please start making idiots dig graves Covid-19 victims? nice. oh. wait even bother. sub turns freaking r/conspiracy comes fearmongering schools kids. sudden science matter anecdotes somebody's high school 20 cases!! There‚Äôs little history word - back germ theory people thought disease spread ‚Äúmiasma‚Äù runs oil beef Boice live Houston, TX wearing mask 100% time I‚Äôm outdoors, specifically walk dog. feel quite silly sometimes, especially considering live dumpster fire state comes COVID - believe easier adapt adopting ‚Äúif leave house, mask goes on‚Äù rule. anti-vaxxers downvoting you. prefer called ""vaccine skeptics"". Heaven forbid call ""politically correct"" name. They're oppressed /s North Texas LOL important thing stop spreading 1.put mask
2. Stop sick ppl entering country

Just look hongkong, taiwan new zealand. Mask use social distancing seems like simple change manners. Hurts one, empowers yourself. travel cultures, basic stuff. need learn Asia. critical mass population vaccinated, say you!

I personally abstain vaccine won‚Äôt 100% effective want wait bit see things shake subject super-spreader type environments. don‚Äôt think tenable maintain government restrictions people vaccinated. let virus run rampant months locked down. NZ they'd even fatality.

People would absolutely smash China human rights violation locked became pandemic. People still whined lock down. Plus, locking instantly whenever new pathogen emerge probably good idea.

If talking speed locking down, countries like Vietnam worthy discussion (more travelers Wuhan)? I'm pretty sure NZ first one instantly lock down.

Vietnam probably swiftest, locking two months earlier (before first fatality 31st July) Thailand (first Covid outside China) New Zealand. I've grocery store every week seen ZERO people wearing mask. Mass #1 country mask compliance. guess depends city though. Ok kinda selfish safe go back theaters? kinda miss chilling laughing big time movies strangers That's half country taking part testing! Well... come Canada. want saying based March higher death rates? Chapeau! excellent explanation regarding insanity Belgian politics. I‚Äôve stayed American Belgian, it‚Äôs mess long time. wrong are.

Africa's interesting case. youngest see unusual paradox generally poor healthcare living conditions, they're less likely overall heavily impacted covid.

For countries median age barely minted adult, *really will* 'just flu' part. National Health Commission said statement 44 new cases imported infections originating overseas.

So 5? it‚Äôs federally funded wouldn‚Äôt appropriate question ask impacts inflation instead? Honestly, federal government sovereign currency issuer, user, deficit matter case? inflation doesn‚Äôt budge harm done. pretty much assumed one person household gets everyone gets it. actually spreads less easily thought. job, school, socialization, hey least government sends u crumbs u send back amazon netflix.  anti-masker. I'm surprised took long show colours.

Nah sorry anti maker. force beliefs others. 

I wear shop, medical reason exempt. see someone without mask cry, could legitimate reason. 

If truly believe science behind ppe know fine. protected even someone else wearing mask. 
So causing undue stress crying getting angry every time see someone wearing mask. 

It's job police it, I'm sure governments tighten restrictions deem necessary. know do, even think do. get it?

Oh irony palpable. Explain scarf better nothing. Explain cloth scarf stops particles micron level?
Or maybe, maybe judge reasons exempt.

You talk saving lives, happy force medically exempt wrap scarf around face think best. Haha.

Anyway go work, nice day! Next time want rage ""antimasker"" call them, take deep breath, think human person front you.

It shame. ultimate source article study summer proved Covid particles remain airborne 3 hours. precisely nothing outdoor transmission, widely accepted scientific community little concern. It‚Äôs whether virus remain airborne - - factors: much air dilute it? UV rays? Wind separating particles further? 

So think this. What‚Äôs riskier: outside without mask, indoor dining?

I‚Äôm pissed personally CLEARLY indoor dining riskier, that‚Äôs still allowed people make money it. However apartment dweller longer allowed breathe fresh air nobody makes money that. 

It‚Äôs disgusting. Enforce masks indoors. Require times INSIDE - still wasn‚Äôt established order! work 6‚Äô away others, mask needed. addressed items. security theater best. want it, get it.

Its shame.

The Sputnik vaccine tested enough. countries political systems, look back history still shapes present.

Belgium fairly young nation European terms. sits directly border Northern Southern Europe. reflected language border directly cutting country.

Historically, border also meant parts country, past 2.000 years, governed different feudal sovereigns. Take historic maps 1200s 1800's see mean.

Belgium basically forged feudal counties, dukedoms principalities. one point centers absolute economic political power within European realm.

The 1815 Vienna Conference tried restore Europe pre French Revolution. So, decided fuse territories Dutch Kingdom, disregarding economic, political, cultural religious differences. So, union last long 1830, Belgium emerged revolution.

The problem nation still potpourri old small stated fiefdoms. fact, many larger cities region, one point another, city states anything name. Much like Firenze, Siena Venice one point. so, Belgium always struggled identity. Ask Belgian honestlt feel country answer mixed bag.

All spawned famous Belgian Compromise. ability elites population compromise differing interests order keep things going. However, compromise abate tensions different peoples make population forces want fracture country back old constituent parts.

The current crisis made old divisions tensions crystal clear again. Belgium seen fair share state reforms past 50 years, morphing unitary towards federal state semi-autonomuous regions. see much finished product well brewing stew still much simmering something else.

While Belgium proved stable prosperous state past 190 years, mystery hold future. saying since start people really care stopping spread make schools online option homeschool. ever worked kids know fast germs spread, there's coincidence cases many countries began spike September. pay ton taxes, curriculum available parents want homeschool kids. vaccines work.

The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 causing ongoing COVID-19 pandemic particularly virulent elderly children largely spared. Here, explored potential role cross-reactive immunity acquired pediatric vaccinations exposure common human pathogens protection pathology COVID-19. end, sought peptide matches SARS-CoV-2 (identity ‚â• 80%, least eight residues) proteomes 25 human pathogens vaccine antigens, subsequently predicted B cell reactivity identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. found viruses subject pediatric vaccinations contain cross-reactive epitopes SARS-CoV-2, precluding provide general protection COVID-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, several herpesviruses also poor null sources cross-reactive immunity SARS-CoV-2, discarding immunological memory viruses general protective pathological role COVID-19. contrast, found combination vaccines treating diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis infectious diseases (DTP vaccine) significant sources potential cross-reactive immunity SARS-CoV-2. DTP cross-reactive epitopes SARS-CoV-2 include numerous CD8 CD4 cell epitopes broad population protection coverage potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several DTP vaccinations, including three-four doses first year life one 4‚Äì6 years age. Moreover, low antigenic Tdap dose also given ages 9‚Äì14. Thereby, children may well protected SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive immunity elicited DTP vaccinations, supporting testing general population prevent COVID-19. saying never open again? pretty silly times you‚Äôre walking alone woods. guess given total solitude makes ridiculous, also means it‚Äôs enforceable conditions (unless choose narc suppose).

Foreseeable future? lives couple months years now. 

You sound really angry, precisely problem? 2bln vaccines, China's India's work trying vaccinate countries that's appx 60% world population. U.S. Canada already deals supply vaccines populations. I'm sure many European countries same, united making sure Europe vaccinated. Vaccinating Europe along Canada US would help get world vaccination rates 75%

I'm sure countries like Australia, Japan, South Korea plans vaccinate. 

Mexico Argentina already signed deals produce distribute vaccines South America.


Luckily there's plenty organizations stepping make sure people get vaccinated around world.


Hopefully wealthy nations realize need help others, come logistical solution share distribute excess vaccines have. Hopefully working together team. Would surprising. we'll see Well thats bummer. Agreed.

Some researchers think superspreading events need shut down, calibration robust, TTI data collection bad.

However, find likely least contrary sparse TTI data small amount behavioural superspreaders almost solely responsible keeping epidemic alive. Tbh don‚Äôt support government interfering people‚Äôs lives control now. Pandemic pandemic. Well there‚Äôs difference scenario aren‚Äôt printing money, they‚Äôre funding program, therefore inflation shouldn‚Äôt really exist. example 1000 dollars month still buys 1000 dollars goods. It‚Äôs costing anybody anymore produce anything, cost business wouldn‚Äôt go up. might go taxes, fees certain purchases.

For example Bernie wanted make free college charging small fee every Wall Street transaction. There‚Äôs many transactions every day charging small amount money could generate billions dollars year. 

It sounds like socialism, case, already programs like social security people pay gets redistributed. there‚Äôs reason it. 

Furthermore, extra 1000 dollars spend every month I‚Äôll it‚Äôs going get spent. Even ‚Äúsave it‚Äù invest it, it‚Äôs going spent later day, technically I‚Äôm saving 1000 money still putting 1000 back economy based normally spend. think idea younger people would receive would able pay student loans faster, put money economy, buy houses, cars, things like that. certainly money doesn‚Äôt cause inflation, money doesn‚Äôt cause inflation, everyone money also doesn‚Äôt cause unless need increase prices, like wages set 15 dollars hour, cost beef goes up, prices adjust accordingly instance shouldn‚Äôt need adjust. Ex po nen tial gro th real peo ple Nah.

Maybe Slovaks consume news mainly TV media, Facebook lies &amp; hoaxes affect mainstream opinions much.

If sister really wanted sure, that's great! know impossible PCR tests whole country quickly (it'd take months cost several times more), still good idea, opinion. Oh hope friends' family alright! 

Oh, live? make guess, would say Ohio (that's US Slovaks live)? lived life US moved recently?

Frankly, I'm big fan him. He's childish, communicates poorly (albeit emotion), picks unreasonable fights overall he's good opposition polician pointing governing party's mistakes think he's got takes actually govern country. reason I'm happy he's PM he's least corrupt comparing Fico/Pellegrini slowly revealed arrests lately. Plus lean liberal whereas party lean conservative side (there numerous attempts toughen abortion laws). 

So better could better. Yeah, no, everyone hates people scam emergency.

It's already political point go people. US, yes, able steal money. 

TLDR everyone hates people like you, there's going heavy political pressure nail scammers like wall. Theyve taken Trump times.  Trump like either.  far enough right them. Yeah ive wearing kn95s thia whole time. March people looked like nuts. Yet walking dog I've passed countless people coughing time. Big, ugly hacking coughs. 

I'd much rather everyone think I'm overreacting breathe someone's unfiltered hacking cough droplets pandemic. Sweden learned absolutley nothing. Melbourne also lower population less density yay civic duty. understand argument locking down, talking masks? people care much wear mask public year two? Seriously, big deal? I'd understand first moving work student job prove income seems bit excessive (in particular student that's... lot money).

Again, glad EU (well, EEA) citizen... xd Presumably, China placed mandatory medical observation/isolation test positive, even asymptomatic. study Netherlands also found household transmission rate 20%, know. remotely. Half contract COVID never even know get sick. ""Only"" 15% become sick need medical attention. 

The complexity part problem. become stupid entitled country can't think through, can't recognize there's huge distinction behaving responsibly wearing masks, limiting contact others, listening epidemiologists, ""fear-mongering.""

So one extreme people seeming say ""we're gonna die,"" people saying, ""it's democrat hoax murder christian babies"" (or whatever assholes saying), people extremes pulled toward one direction, far many pulled toward thinking real. noted four days' worth numbers, 8 deaths 2500 cases per day instead 30 deaths 10000 cases. obviously situation good right now. think part problem people scared virus anymore, spring people stayed home due fear virus would like 10% fatality rate something like that. young even middle aged people really perceive threatened fewer people choosing stay home. clearly scientist. need tell us. That‚Äôs i‚Äôm well. Unless vaccines prevent 100 percent covid infections, won‚Äôt, likely significant electorates still pushing mandates like this.

really? They're outside, chill. Believe not, don‚Äôt really mean criticisms. think may presented bit negatively one positive flip side. comes discussing values like this, really aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbetter worse,‚Äù they‚Äôre different. example, Germans much reluctant change value safety stability whereas US, care long term consequences. 

1) Separation church state. Sure practice true definition Germany conservative Christan country. float idea making state institutions religiously neutral, answer n√∂. example, go public university is, officially, Christan institution. zero impact school‚Äôs operations still think it‚Äôs really weird public university allowed religion. 

2) want entrepreneur, start business, sort side hustle, good fucking luck. US, entrepreneurship highly valued encouraged. want open Etsy shop, bake custom order cakes, build furniture garage, need website you‚Äôre good go. Germany, there‚Äôs much red tape it‚Äôs basically impossible things. Small businesses highly valued US essentially discouraged Germany. 

3) vein Germans generally terrified innovation. see lack acceptance card payments state internet/telecommunications infrastructure best example healthcare. Unlike card payments fiberglass, money plays important role, isn‚Äôt really reason need full doctor‚Äôs appointment get flu shot talk pharmacist buy ibuprofen. efficient point Germans like be, they‚Äôre willing waste time avoid changing outdated system. US, go Walmart get flu shot like 10 minutes buy bottle Aspirin without talking single person convenience important tradition we, whole, reject idea ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs done.‚Äù 

4) popular well liked super important America Germans really don‚Äôt care all. isn‚Äôt Germans ‚Äúrude‚Äù (they aren‚Äôt) much effort you‚Äôre expected put given relationship. Sure ignore coworkers US people going think you‚Äôre weird talk behind back. Germany? Totally acceptable. I‚Äôve personally noticed Germany, either give 100% give 0%. US, you‚Äôre pretty much expected give everyone (your neighbors, coworkers, distant cousins‚Ä¶) least 25% bare minimum pretend are. hear you, chuckled i‚Äôm fan 28 days later movie. shoulda woulda coulda. 

Yeap. Eeh. Lockdown works people follow it, tool getting additional time set up, oh, testing contact tracing, used individual quarantines.

If works, going game changer far getting information. seems rather punitive esp respect requiring outdoors. Still one lowest daily infection rates Europe, though, population adjusted.

Due change weather, possible also kids back school, conditions spread virus changed. happening across cooler areas northern hemisphere, makes think almost surely weather related. Almost respiratory illnesses spread better winter. Vaccines give stronger longer-lasting immunity infections. Moreover, get booster shots.  absolutely do. look up. fairness, lot easier 100% border control. running excuse bullshitting what?

people bringing masks they're getting ticketed excuse away people now. even though end encountering people anyway. mandate would prevent people skirting guidelines like that. good mandate. Massachusetts numbers hotspots gone almost order magnitude since September despite flaccid mask mandate place before. live here, don't. fuck off. Tegnell that? Region Uppsala increasing number testing centres weeks. charge, FHM, Tegnell. nothing clear agree disagree outside rather ignorant assumptions made.  given comment opinions intrusive government surveillance (or think Edward Snowden).  

Maybe well travelled.  IME well travelled people quickly stop making statements like ""People X country Y"".  takes lot ignorance say things like confidence almost always incorrect statements anyways. march again? scientific accomplishment. 

It accomplishment sustained effort city five million people listened scientific governmental advice instead running around like group headless chickens shouting muh freedom, instead able take comply sensible measures place societies understoood generations. found fascinating balanced portrayal Wuhan. I‚Äôm curious others think. don‚Äôt know. you? mean? Stockholm 165% herd immunity! sub preaches listening scientists actually read anything epidemiologist written last 6 months. they're still frantically wiping surfaces. Theres damage, virus caused government. many young spread disease vulnerable? Amazing news! Yeah it'll covid 18 tests they've got. know people personally reason. Like said earlier though, I‚Äôm doctor medical plans prescribed trained professional. Agreed, half marathon mask problem I'm average runner best. put comfort aside, anyone else too. Week 43 (which mostly complete now) average 5 deaths/day. Week 44 complete already 3/day. big deal. 

But slightest inconvenience much. Oh, you‚Äôre talking Dementor scenario people got lax though end July August. 

I‚Äôm exception- group friends started playing basketball masks 1-2 hours every Friday. agree weren‚Äôt feeling well someone families feeling weather, person would skip got COVID test symptoms, weren‚Äôt wearing masks playing. No. That's Tegnellists. second wave. Tegnell using newspeak Tegnellists said Sweden's strategy worked since avoided second wave. huge second wave here. Tegnell cowardly even put words mouth.

But loves certain words. Like immunity. problem speculating immunity. never epistemological concerns immunity. Nothing like ""what *is* immunity actually. can't really *say* herd immunity isn't"". ask shall Interesting over-reactive immune response problem COVID-19? Hopefully something like produced sterilizing immunity humans lab without massive side effects upon challenge SARS-CoV-2. wear mask whenever go anywhere people. zero problem that. want wear mask walking dog absolutely one around. would high traffic area barely see single person walk far apart. cares driving safely, likely die something happens maybe break leg, get concussion get slightly crippled! Easiest least sophisticated?

We tried isolate suburb failed locked to. also compulsory mask wearing, clear enforcement also much improved contact tracing testing well measures sewerage testing.

We government daily briefings answered questions journalists 100 days.

I know think sophisticated is, that's current levels technology.

We also population large willing get behind measures.

Also, seasons wrong factor spread, magnitudes different - fact countries hemisphere badly affected, season lot confounding factors. someone maintained 25 mpw average throughout pandemic, I've always kept mask running 100% time. moment pull know I'll struggle want wear again. Erm Canadian, positive neighbours wouldn't. Agreed, hopefully remain healthy over.

Swedish you‚Äôre tuning countries situation? right you‚Äôre downvoted. Statistically, people survive coronavirus. Even elderly.

It‚Äôs fact there‚Äôs combination extreme transmissibility higher mortality 60+ age always problem, combined unknown long term health impacts age levels. sub likes it‚Äôs human interest stories, it‚Äôs hardly sitting trumpeting false narrative lethality among young. Dude, get help. Seriously. yet, indoor restaurants remain open. Guess one things actually spreading virus? Morbid obesity 13? Whatever. Chang flu? OMG OMG take completely seriously. Tbh I'm surprised 5,000 day now. possible national lockdown outside wartime situation Sweden. That's regional measures restrictions instead measures forced. family China. stocking rice kilos

The great flood annihilated 2/3 countries agriculture summer. famine surely coming. Chinese living mainland stock late government leaves die like Mao Yeah that‚Äôs succinct way putting antibodies diminish infection gone. That‚Äôs immune system works. Effector cells (memory cells) recognize infection infected produce stronger faster immune response.  Could reason testing-tracking keeping anymore Tegnell thought Sweden won, believe second wave Sweden?

I think time stop listening man. Pretty sure count deaths illnesses. angers end want schools open. completely remove children district keep home moron said would safe go back.

Same moron said, ‚Äúwell, no, can‚Äôt guarantee child won‚Äôt get sick, taking precautions‚Äù. 

Idiots. get mentality. France England lockdown schools remain open. look countries better results, emulate them. Like Asian countries successful containing it, used hard lockdown thorough contact tracing isolation exposed. effectively threw away gains containment made lockdowns this. It‚Äôs overkill though. you‚Äôre outside socially distance, there‚Äôs negligible risk. would problem deaths per day 5000, would take seriously?  Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è there's [a checker help decide whether get tested not. obviously, like self-testing thing, perfect, help decide. basically you‚Äôre cautiously optimistic Atlas. White House completely gave said, ""Fuck it, let's pretend pandemic hope people stupid enough believe us.""  I'll believe see it.

We can't organise piss-up brewery atm. [The US rounding recognize black white issue, described, able grasp nuance. 

You learn defunding means here: course real tight hold entirely wrong idea posted above, case look word ""obstinate"" term ""willful ignorance"".

To sum up: want police respond calls require particular set skills don't. instance, arresting black man walking street, killing him: We'd prefer that. Arresting armed assholes attack political caravans way rally? Yes, that.

This logic difficult. 1 life still equals 1 life transfer COVID patients Germany: hospitals

Yeah owe Germans lot stroopwafels done. Sorry hear that. heard two people unsure sick exposed, better isolate rather quarantine together (because quarantining separately makes sure ones get sick really get sick, together makes much likely one got sick, will). 

Circulating air? Hmm, maybe getting fresh air somehow filtering air. making circulate probably help much, keeps virus aerosolized air. Ah yes, notoriously non-partisan thing completely separate state nothing politics, public health. thank morons country instead I‚Äôm trying say read sides much find extrapolate somewhere middle, might billions doses best case scenario, distribution still take time apparently undertaking flu vaccine average CVS.

Quite opposite happening Medicare paying 2.5x payouts covid related hospitalizations l covid patient administered pneumonia paying hospitals 13k 39k go ventilator. hate break wayyy higher 97000 new actual cases. Like said CDC reports infection rate 6-24x reported numbers actual new cases actually closer 600k minimum. Dont panic attack good news mortality rate actually take himself. never said going take it. said going give priority people. Sorry who's enforcing exactly? police? police wearing masks, full stop.  never heard -- [this Johns Hopkins FAQ think isolate   Write Fauci 2020 ya go you‚Äôre wealthy look golden visa programs offered Greece, Spain, Portugal... told Arizonans weren‚Äôt worried Covid-19 somehow they‚Äôre going passed by. see wrong Hospitals aren‚Äôt given vaccines advance. Pfizer given timescale seeking approval no-one else has. Pfizer confident vaccine passing FDA regulations. head-start doesn‚Äôt matter, Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine better. doesn‚Äôt really matter, current vaccines stopgap better vaccines future like Novavax‚Äôs Imperial College‚Äôs proof vaccine safe?

Okay authoritarian I‚Äôd rather bring knowledge well-known fact dems supermajority legislature, can/will (and past) pass law saying Baker appoint Democratic Senator Warren‚Äôs seat. Wear mask want live Cool. who's Charlie Baker? Rude selfish ask me. I'm glad hear that! Quite frankly find idiotic. understand lockdown fever. experienced absolutely love socializing partying. However, reality COVID still America cases climbing daily. party middle pandemic idiotic serves extend problem. country Singapore, bit bullet community transfers single digits 0. pays off. get back partying sooner without guilt spreading virus day arriving far faster America resisted urge.

No fucking practicality 3 yr old problem wearing mask. It‚Äôs hard, people.  so. think understand better considering read research prior pandemic hitting. There's multiple factors found, I'm deeply concerned research showing breathing cold air suppresses type interferons ignored considering every day seeing evidence published role type interferons play COVID19.

The transmission spikes summer entirely people deciding needed zero precautions engaging activities strongly recommended against. Losing summer blockbusters horror season sucked! issue Trump installed corrupt crony sabotage post office. Fuck I'm tired shit show. make scientific sense aims mask control?  Considering Target Costco weekend, workers places pulled masks multiple times yell coworkers several aisles (or whole store) away, nothing grocery store, rather people's ability think.  one wears watch check time, wear style like necklace - good analogy 

I don‚Äôt turn phone every message bc that‚Äôs phones lmao... battery reason.

Im gonna take hat shade likely i‚Äôll take go inside... like wearing mask it‚Äôs dependent situation.

I wear mask around people allowed take ones near by. Stop overly simplistic comparisons that‚Äôs don‚Äôt apply. Adding Larry Hogan Maryland. Making exceptions rules usually point people get confused I‚Äôm rules apply don‚Äôt. we‚Äôre isn‚Äôt working, get deal stringent rules. old rules followed well, wouldn‚Äôt ratchet up, continue caseloads fall. ty! want people die. ended super small halloween wedding sister's backyard masks. would waited, husband's (omg that's weird say!) mother stage 4 ovarian cancer, next year might us. wanted sure case saw us get married. Also brother REALLY bad shape health-wise well. like 14 people super immediate family. sooo cold backyard gorgeous! hard decision. hand sanitizer everywhere kept families apart. extremely stressful. smiling happy. We'll bigger celebration next year. Ah yes, is. go-to ignorant comment government canes people chewing gum. nothing except show uneducated are. truly feel sorry you. Sucks me, work Hotels.

In general support people working home job allows it, going lasting impact industry. People realized quick video chat replace sending someone conference, time. They're wrong think so, end, sucks.

I suspect many years get full time work again. science says indoor dining perfectly fine running cycling someone open air less one second dangerous? science? There's big difference. Much like gyms same, goes restaurants.

Having drunk strangers mingle get close together defines bar. much likely going behavior like would typical sitdown. documented spread come bars people barhopping multiple establishments drunk caring.... opposed sit-down restaurants. (But I'm repeating point). Scaremongering alright?

I'd call trying safe many lifes possible.

Agree disagree.

I'm German way. Look numbers still started second lockdown. Maybe want listen best handling virus. studies week suggesting immunity genrally lasts least months (studies able last much longer that). odd reinfection disprove that.

Also vaccine produce stronger immune response infection. exhausting comment. wish able witness eye roll groan. Furthermore, thats still really citation it? consider amount social distancing going on, lot things shut bit straw man it? thousands 3 year olds charging around streets rubbing hands everything it? calls Boris resign already(Labour leading Tories 5 points), Macron even lower rating Trump dealing virus, 40% approval Trump, 37% Macron, French pretty pissed Yes agree. Surgical homemade masks aren‚Äôt protect yourself. isn‚Äôt don‚Äôt care others don‚Äôt wear them. Don‚Äôt get wrong, irks end careful masks hate wearing too. isn‚Äôt fair me.

It isn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt bother people don‚Äôt wear masks called for. irks even government overstepping. Saying need every tome leave property overreach. careful am, putting walk around quiet block. cross road see someone walking road. don‚Äôt want live fear Covid government. Completely believable. US-based hospital shut non-emergency surgery week, ran lean operating room schedule (basically emergencies + time sensitive cancer cases only) better part month first peak. Needing go outside interact also invented 2019. fact invented dawn primates. Yet protesting even though half ""deadly"" cigarettes clearly mind made thanks pal agree. no-one going spend next 6 hours watching dumb fuck conspiracy videos debunk them. 

Which exactly want smug sense victory even though shit except post youtube links can't explain actually believe believe it. people aren‚Äôt though. That‚Äôs issue. mental health already damaged first, new wave either create new ones, send peoples mental health deep end. misheard, also noted passing help people inspections. imagine great help 9+ drunk people arguing crowd sitting together. you, I'm totally guessing here. Thanks info! George Carlin would thrashing sides political spectrum like sane person be. game them. don‚Äôt think science points ‚Äúincreasing‚Äù chances. feel free give source touching mask major source community transmission. Lol honestly think there's two week lag registering COVID deaths count one hand? 

And point surging cases, current surge started 7 weeks ago, yet deaths remain flat regardless. cells respond infection. 
To get infection, need? virus. 
Can u remain contagious? say yes, say no. 
Antibidies prevent getting infection become contagious though. think rollout vaccine gets closer, easier see light end tunnel. think people see light end tunnel easier accept delay plans, needed 2021 based vaccine rollout goes. People looking window walk empty street. Imminently Flu vaccine different. cocktail based estimatations prevelant specific strains be, plus flu mutates far quickly. covid vaccine expected match variants. look numbers thats 1000 free ICU beds daily! Winning! called lazy shit and/or giving youre sick it. ""CAN"", mean will. survival rate speaks itself. Stop scaremongering. viruses starts way lose mind thousands viruses come before? Citation needed, I‚Äôm calling BS.

‚Äú Currently, areas world reporting transmission SARS. Since end global epidemic July 2003, SARS reappeared four times ‚Äì three times laboratory accidents (Singapore Chinese Taipei), southern China source infection remains undetermined although circumstantial evidence animal-to-human transmission.‚Äù

Source: burdensome wearing mask compared protecting lives?

And everything saying predicated completing studies hit done would prove outdoor transmission impossible.

Your point moot data supporting theory available. then, risk management mode, means erring side caution, selfish comfort. Pretty certain George Carlin would calling people froth mouth fear porn dumb ones, cool. plexiglass barrier us them

That's exactly best example. think touching contaminated surface touching mask repeatedly increase chances getting it? 
 
Ok. seems difficult understand makes rule simple. 
 
If house, mask on. wife Dutch, lives Paris. month 1/2 ago, went see mother elderly care house eastern part Netherlands. 

She one wearing mask. that, staff ease wearing mask. city, went bakery, merchant serve kept mask. tried explain wearing protect them, herself, avail. 

I hope changed stance now. Broken record. knew ever since earlier year dicknuts removed restrictions let Florida man loose lot easier enforce now.

Depending actual wording order (and said press conference), may easier fight court. repealed, people emboldened ignore laws. 

It's short term moral victory pro-mask people, long term suspect lead ""moral"" victory anti-maskers. RTS,S certainly less live Massachusetts really new policy kind blow neighborhood often see nobody I'm walking around. 

But Boston (our biggest city) many cities around college towns. expensive here, we're densely populated. Large groups outside, sans masks, despite mask mandates, gathering limits, lot PR pressure schools.  

So, even though like policy kinda agree it, understand it. cigarettes invented 2019 would point don't. Thanks playing, try again. Lol god, you‚Äôd hate wouldn‚Äôt you? people drive supermarkets Manhattan, makes buying lot groceries difficult. Even wanted drive, can't park. car easily drive NJ, alternative.

Even lived Queens, walking damn supermarket 2, 3 times week normal things. majority-minority Texas, they're working overtime. me, nothing ""if wear mask woods one around ~~to hear fall~~"" being, itself, effective, rather significant effort culturally normalize mask-wearing. 
 
Why still hard get people wear mask? weird. wearing hat effect masks, people griping all. 
 
It's toothless anyway; there's way enforce mask wearing public trails backyard whatever - Baker's point force people least *thinking* it, stimulate normalized culture around wearing masks, increase percentage people care so. 
 
And no, limited city Boston - there's large swaths populated towns around us similar issues. north shore, instance. Again, passing legislation charges town town - especially towns small close together - makes things confusing. People say ""oh, need wear mask Chelsea? Everette? border East Boston? etc. 
 
Also, Charlie even authority something like city-by-city basis? astonishingly selfish. many people make single adjustment, matter slight, behaviour benefit others. Nah, push towards tighter homes good vapor air control pretty international. We‚Äôre trying reach energy targets buildings now. 

Honestly super tight home usually fresh air supply system takes outside air warms/cools via heat exchanger exiting air. deal bathroom kitchen water vapor modern homes. typical exhaust Fan won‚Äôt able pull fresh air leaks house wrap/windows. give fuck this? difference make you? Yup. stupid, makes worthless pathetic playing politics instead science. trying rewrite legacy.

In end, confirms knew better act. phew, thank god! handle another 6 months thing, thanks current admin beating thing hardwork putin

/s Yes? plenty things outside home safe, eating clearly one them. understand need, no. Honestly shocked recommend protecting vulnerable. assume everyone thinks one way. Major kudos you. 100% agree testing resources vulnerable people work them. reason children locked up, suffering, using valuable testing resources basically immune. 

Also really good points contact tracing. personally trust ""private"" businesses tracking govt. Quotes bc right big companies like google probably give data. sure hell agree humane quarantining. Broken Record. Keeps skipping. studies week suggesting immunity genrally lasts least months (studies able last much longer that). odd reinfection disprove that. case antibodies produced, quickly decline issue.

Also vaccine produce stronger immune response infection. Kiwi knows that. doesn‚Äôt care. Explaining anything futile. get IQ mob. Take lowest IQ person group, divide number people group. credible source says touching mask get anyone around sick. 

Wear mask youre around people, don‚Äôt you‚Äôre not. Lmao, it‚Äôs difficult. virus spreads rapidly. Massachusetts. Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire counties lowest case rates state outside MV &amp; Nantucket. Trump said we‚Äôre ‚Äúrounding turn‚Äù idiotic bullshit liberal hoax remember /s Storage. Dry ice heats evaporates. can't get everyone location injected fast. store -80. provide better protection wearing one, everyone wears limits exposure entire group. think said can't avoided. sucks sure, I'm hopeful mental health starts larger point discussion overall. least part education, become disfunctional adults can't identify what's wrong them, can't understand emotions crisis-mode every second day week(as I've seen many, many people like lately).  done. know it. stressful hard, definitely impossible.

You seem treat virus like inconvenience. see wearing mask negligent attempted mass manslaughter. Sorry translation rough here. literally title article so... *rounding corner*, there's 800 pound gorilla waiting us side.

Floridians, **WEAR MASKS !!** no, not. 
 
repeatedly touching mask good thing, convoluted rules need wear mask dont good thing. 
 
This straight forward rule, wearing mask prohibit getting enough air. /r/unexpectedbiden Florida dropped 9th place nationally, may soon drop 10th place soon, depending Arkansas numbers--A month ago, Florida second place, virus growing much faster states now--North Dakota 57,000/million, Florida 37,000/million--Florida also remains 10th place deaths/million people followed guidelines, deadly could back April. enough swastika So, covid linger air 3 hours. walk around 4th DENSLY POPULATED city America, droplets air 3 hours, albeit less concentrated. People transfer droplets playground nearby kids touch playground.

What described, sounds lot like air born virus. Must difficult feeble fragile time. 

I agree vaccine never mandatory - masks negative. 

If you‚Äôre fine law saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt walk around naked public‚Äù, mask dress code really shouldn‚Äôt issue. better pay, treat better. I'm nurse believe crap expected put with. patient unhappy, matter reason, nurse getting blamed. walked away $65/hr job due poor treatment turn recruiters offering $75-100 hour currently care enough put nonsense anymore. IHME model project 2,500 daily deaths throught december january, peak. Even think high number since we're already seeing new cases flattening 100,000 probably go anytime soon. Maybe early say still, distancing mask wearing show numbers somehow. can't keep climbing indefinitely. Interesting, 7 day average daily deaths Georgia THREE FUCKING PEOPLE.

Interesting, ... look graphs TX Georgia fluctuating around numbers

Let's throw Florida, basically given Masks really work bc small margin?

Since thesis destroyed, can't use answer question. masks work via [other US states mandating use face masks public greater decline daily COVID-19 growth rates issuing mandates compared states issue mandates. many homes super insulated / weather-tight are, post-70s heating fuel crisis? I'm spending next 6 hours day writing 10 page term paper. fault attention span pay attention something ten minutes let alone 3+ hours wearing mask protecting yourself, care people chose wear one. that's works.

If wear mask don't, I'm 20% protected 80% protected. get safety, I'm one gets screwed. (I know actual numbers are, illustrative. Covering infected person's mouth works better covering uninfected person's mouth.) Everything revolves around US, know? I'm literally shaking. can't handle knowing many people died. Well. Covid likely still return. Found another Torrent alt. used needed wear mask public couldn‚Äôt six feet away. saying need wear mask public even you‚Äôre able six feet apart. Also George Carlin: ""Never underestimate power stupid people large groups"" think thats true everywhere. Guy know tell vapor pressure combustion chemistry, start talking virus liberal plot destroy great president. everybody expects Wonder vaccine that's going put us back normal soon get injected it. agree need something better nothing. I'm arguing vaccine I'm saying people need temper expectations. No. nailed it. fact vaccines sometimes side effects confirms conspiracy theory? Bill Gates related? foundation pays vaccinations countries can't afford them? article say damn thing nanoparticles. proof none things claim. wondering property filters facilitate one-way instead two-way travel.

They reduce spread water droplets person exhales. water droplets viruses attached them. float around either fall surface inhaled another person.

Some water droplets still spread person exhales. vented side travel far. health officials recommending combination masks social distancing.

I seen masks create tight enough seal force air filter material itself. Even N95 rated masks need test fitted ensure proper seal.  Lots interventions medically beneficial eschew burdensome. Forcing people mask times seems excessive benefit yields, any. everyone lives densely populated cities. ""Nobody knows buying something tested correctly"" yes, us know, need agreement place share vaccines case phase 3 goes well approved. government due dilligence explore options.

He said going take 10 million doses arrive december, unfair vaccine now. virus spreading walked somewhat near someone without mask though. isn't. saying 7 billion people gather room plot together forgot million pose enlightened found masterplan? way. think people matter though. weddings, travel, festivals yada yada. couple things think people banking summer 2021 differences kinda matter. think assuming major distribution issues, it‚Äôs safe bet. stereotype Americans big egotistical assholes superiority complex actually turned completely true.

I mean, put way, reminds saying ""when point finger someone pointing three fingers right back you."" really true fingers curl, maybe still get point. never specified big corner was. want get cool I'll get mine sooner. surprised though can't travel go events like people get it. people aware, new modern day version gish gallop.

It's sad. Thank you, BootyFista, M.D.

Seriously speaking though, concerted effort professionals around globe quell thing, we‚Äôll good chance. It‚Äôs race time, exponents potential efficacy.

Enjoy shutting like always have. protesters OUTSIDE wearing MASKS SOCIAL DISTANCING it‚Äôs exponentially safer eating restaurant indoors. tired argument. see say Gavin Newsom regards amusement parks.

Oh well related Nancy Pelosi said hug people Chinatown evil libs. üôÑ CDC claim recently virus airborne droplets? Also, large gigantic water droplets blocked another mask inhalation? all, breathing forcefully droplets stopped dead mask (and keep mind billions trillions virus infected droplets spewing every single time exhale, one stray droplet blocked someone else's mask? mask stop trillions them, hell woman's mask stop one droplet made her? 

Do see I'm getting at? Earth buy magically one-directional mask? normal mask would worked better

Stop shopping magic shop.

And can't look like that, this: imagine trillions droplets blocked way tell mask bought lets single droplet in. Tell mask let happen. Watching videos rothschilds going save anyones lives lmao. Gimmie Biden Win/Vaccine Approval 1-2 punch, need feel positivity again. There's argument had.

If ventilation issue reason, also use liquid nitrogen that's bit extreme. Dude... mean Bush started pandemic plan ""outlines it"" Obama setting team handle it? making years scientists telling something going happen, better prepared. actually trump dismantled team meaning can't prep it. 

Also event 201? Like Sweden big second resurgence.

Wasn't based broad immunity? remember Tegnell expressing disappointment low T-cell rate Stockholm June. herd immunity assumption was? US Spanish Flu deaths 675,000.

To fair, didn‚Äôt antibiotics back then. surpassed 1/3 number modern medicine. mass communication tells people simple measures must follow reduce transmission. Luckily Trump get way. applications approval even submitted key words 'confirmed cases'. extremely difficult expensive confirm reinfection cases. Truth is, absolutely idea many unconfirmed reinfection cases floating around there.

Stop claiming 'rare'. ONE knows common reinfections are.

Those claim rare either propagandists, clue talking about. think standing outside, masked, hopefully top one another even remotely comparable seated close together, indoors, face exposed, environment people notoriously talk loudly. dined inside since early March. chose dine outside couple times town, otherwise take me. it! flattened curve... also CDC, time already compromised Trump administration. trust report good faith. Plus zero follow up. I'm calling anecdote plant. that's exactly reaction conditioned Models showing 2-6k dead per day. Yeah look well turned out

And ""curtail"" it. Death rates never lower stable.

To me, law bit like instituting draft fight Covid.

I understand Trump say, ""In war, warriors given body armor, helmets, gas masks --- equipment need keep safe fight. think soldiers embarrassed wear gas mask tear gas launched them? Hell no. We're war Covid, every American warrior fight. protective gear mask --- wear pride."" maybe arguments begin with.

Oh well, gonna do.  penalty? convenient way increase govt coffers, money get pushed needed (mainly, healthcare)? Yeah what's general feeling among Floridians DeSantis? seems like pos Sitting field alone mask ""ahh todays gonna good day""

 dunno colleges, high school/grade schools area require temperature checks entering school lunch, masks distancing required, plastic screens around desks, class students stays together, eats lunch together, goes recess together mingle classes someone get sick send class home quarantine shut whole school down.

In county surrounding counties there's one case schools know sent home one else got it, likely due regulations following.

And live area half people still wear masks public keep schools going here, schools areas everyone wearing masks even less problems.

No. that. Redditors agree many redditors mind leaving homes. mind, wear mask outdoors. least Reddit show really still sane people world places taking seriously I‚Äôm at.

I mind people care. I'm definitely arguing someone saying ""second wave"". I'm arguing important distinction. What's important looking curve, taking correct actions whether arbitrary criteria reached he's paranoid taking responsibility.

Do understand coronavirus survive outside body long periods? That's 6 ft rule. guy really wants make difference double that. Provide real consequence people endangering others. Increase distancing restaurants.  Lots things make sense. not. Given age health career I'm likely vaccinated late summer next year anyways. However likely going doses given first responders New Years, suggested pharmaceutical companies. I'll happy hear they've recieved protection. lol Don‚Äôt spout evil rhetoric. disgusting.  faaiiirrr... Yeahh people going getting hurt said pessimist instead d00m3r first time way. I'm UK recently I've interested different cities worldwide dealing covid mask mandates.

One useful tool imo collection live public webcams around world, I've using check busy streets. American cops wear masks far tell. TV, public actually job around lots people.

Perhaps cops patrol streets lots bars, I'd thought highest risk areas. Sorry, engage people know proper forms there, their, they're. good one. expecto caronus also leave whether customers wearing masks. big part equation. customers staff wearing proper PPE lower transmission. many dumbasses walk around dick noses chin masks infuriating. following data suggests. advocating everyone something science support. no, fuck you, wear mask outdoors. ‚ÄúLive let die‚Äù

Get country. 25 million half Argentina‚Äôs population last week marched lockdown ‚Äúfake virus‚Äù. Yes, both. currently twice-weekly video reports hospital task force STL. Admissions covid causes. Additionally seeing primarily admissions outlying areas, we've got increased admissions city suburbs too. adjusted population size? Still staggering either way.

edit: would 5322 people today based current US population. Eventually you‚Äôll come realize 900 80 year olds dying lesser evils compared societal economic damage lockdowns. wish could work smarter harder look around man, even basis reimbursed business force close would significantly less pushback. USA 33 times bigger population Sweden. want compare US, Europe EU. want compare individual European countries appropriate compare individual US states. relevant, ideed. break age. Got it, really anything say. Give break. 1 part confirmation bias 2 parts militant ignorance. Alright, election day: last day coronavirus!

/s kinda stink dont wash really think something like ""the rest world"" exists? Lol Hehehe imagining Aussie voice *""you want elevate stage 4! you?""* cannot fold shirt half cover nose mouth wearing shirt. someone wants carry around extra tshirt, go it? 

Masks made job usually comfortable easier speak through. time sit 8 hours every day next month?  you‚Äôre alone, one gonna give ticket....

If tree falls.... thought cared people dying? you?

You choose stay indoors, that's fine. walking outside scares people wearing mask, would strongly suggest locking in. outside world scary. Wow that‚Äôs scary put way.  Winner winner chicken dinner big fan trumps point plane fell sky, news would still COVID. 747 holds 366 passengers, fewer people would die plane crashed every day. So, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs hard justify news covering anything else. R E D

W L V E science said going decrease spread it, houses one people?

Because people need wash themselves, eat, drink, ect.

But simply deflecting cant actually justify opposition outdoor mandatory mask usage. instead trying get defend something exist. Pretty shitty tactic. People argue bad faith usually pieces shit experience. Really think possibility? curious thought well.... actually believe

Two red flags four words:

-""we"" = group identity

-""believe"" = facts going much choice. People probably take vaccine that's available unless want wait several months next one rush getting sick meantime.

Over time vaccines come get those. probably type vaccine wears needs booster anyway. like many weeks now. we're observing first wave going away Southern states, smaller second wave states took hit spring, plus first wave northern states spared spring.

My guess reach hight April - May, still way go. 300,000 deaths total February given. Various NHS trusts preparing staff December vaccination. advised everyone wife's trust get flu shots week least 28 days gap first give vaccine 85s

This new information think communications seen far included non-staff December rollout. Lots mask mandates planes, company even require respirators business travel love word ‚Äúrobust‚Äù. I‚Äôm gonna use more. Let‚Äôs fight robustly! It‚Äôs flu, bruh. biggy, live life, I‚Äôm fucking idiot.  We've taking seriously 10 god damn months.

COVID real we've seen 10-20% excess deaths last 6 months. we've locked down. Schools still mostly closed. People wear masks everywhere (at least DMV am), deadly 1918 pandemic. COVID causing 60-70% amount excess deaths would expect deadly 1918 pandemic. words, 60% bad. can't say ""you can't compare!!"" Yes can. localized mask mandates 1918, politicized. 

I wear mask, whatever. mandate wear outside we've told perfectly safe outside stay 6 ft apart overkill lot people's minds.

Yes, disease kills. fatality rate, according CDC, like 0.5% aged 60-69, like 0.02% 60. Yes higher older folks, thing killing working age people like Spanish Flu.

Supply chains markets starting break down. Go google ""bloomberg Colombia 3 meals day"". People literally starting go hungry shutdowns. 

At point cure worse disease??

The sad fact matter bringing points like get labelled maniac wants people die. tiresome, juvenile argument. tried?  indefinitely everyone shares attitude. three heads, claim anything internet.

But ok, enlighten us actually believe? I'm ears. know law situation well friend. Stay safe stay sane lol  Simple really, virus cant move... spread thing is, did. enough proof going coming Feb March. Back January info definitely there, early scattered tried make sense data.

Truly, enough information scientists researchers provided show going headed... government/media excellent job dumbing nation say least. sophisticated psychological warfare campaigns ever launched on/in US. succeeded, proof going walk around town local Walmart.  Also, overkill? We‚Äôve many Covid deaths already. There‚Äôs overkill keep us safe. Never million years understand mindset. I've constantly swinging jeering schadenfreude genuine concern. winter going motherfucker. results according Fauci, good accomplishment pandemic Correct, we're seeing patients covid positive test antibodies tested months later (like wife were). showing signs, PCR test, abbot test accurate experience.

So jury still healthcare workers we're concerned long immunity lasts. Seriously, guy really seems think 55% population gonna get go hospital *even vaccine*. makes sense. blurb media video scientific source, May certainly current data included, outright state source making claims peer reviewed. Also, literally says somebody caught outside. non-zero number, non-zero chance catching person outside. 

How wear fucking mask instead cherrypicking excuses to. think muster bravery takes let strip fabric touch face. look R/Ontario haha far worse sub still can't compare virus Spanish Flu, unless show stubborn people masks. Also, people think way think *you're* deluded ""realize"" ""brainwashed"" are. Insane.  dad keeps questioning control everywhere, even places, stories like that, pretty clear. lost couple distant family members across country people still tell it‚Äôs fake. actually minimal. I'm big proponent mask usage, well indoors lots people prolonged periods. someone Covid wearing mask classroom everyone else wearing one too, sitting 8 hours means majority still going contract it. Masks great short periods contact, thinking make classrooms office cubicle farms safe public health theater make people feel safe engaging risky behavior. false sense security. what?

The person responded said nothing responsible testing centres. talked possible reason testing centres overwhelmed.

I know want ""go there"", trying change subject.

The question remains - many infections Swedish people listened Tegnell saying Sweden unlikely suffer second wave, thus let guard down?

I'd say that's distinct possibility. flat along, hoax libtards Yea.. would trust experts rely half-baked conspiracy theories make feel intellectually superior? think testing capacity really allow also, pandemic lingers on, people getting infected getting it, granting immunity winter months. saying herd immunity reached yet simply put, virus less less people available infect.

Cool cool cool, tight tight tight Sounds good. see caught downvotes saying anything exactly feeling mask there. Not. Everything. Is. Covid. April best, August/September worst.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* guess disagree. I've seen many friends completely alright wearing mask 4 months ago like ""dude, I've coronavirus long, I'm it"". feel like kinds people convinced government like ""it's still serious, still require everyone wear mask"". I've thought more, even mind order written ""everyone required wear mask public times"" even enforced somewhat loosely, think anyone expecting police officers post Boston esplinade writing tickets runners wearing masks. do, however, like record is, fact, allowed people truly reckless something get rather deal doctors notes scenarios bullshit. makes sense order written absolute makes easier enforce really want to. people protesting masks assholes. Agreed. 

But protests, especially crowded ones, still spread covid. Often it‚Äôs travel protests spread likely. Public transport, carpooling, hired vans etc. excess deaths 300,000.

So that's 300,000 deaths average past 5 years.

How account that?

Also heart disease contagious. unable stand Facebook weeks everything plastered this.
Every news article, everything. can't. wearing pants people see inside house looking window-but can't get covid way. SHITTY ANALOGY LEARN ANALOGY NOOB.

Source? I'm basing guess early spike deaths US. 

People wearing masks, things shut down, doctors little experience treating covid patients, numbers stayed little 3,000 deaths per day. 

Now, think majority country wearing masks public taking social distancing seriously, along hospitals better prepared treat covid patients, winter might see similar daily death numbers first spike, even slightly more, believe we'll reach point 3,000+ dying daily.

The problem country group people, insignificant size, completely non-compliant across board. see problem mainly caused type 'slippery slope' effect revolving around wishy-washy mask rules.  


Intelligent, reasonable people onboard masks day one anything probably slightly 'over-wear' (which fine right, like said there's \*harm\* someone overly safe, they're inconveniencing themselves). words, someone wear mask, they're going type that's like ""Well, really need wear many people grocery store?"" they're going wear they're inside they're retarded.  


It's group people are, effectively non-compliant, wanna get trouble / social pariahs they're trying find excuses wear masks situation possible. 


And fear giving sort legitimate ammo intelligent people 'fear-mongering' going make situation worse. 95% someone saying anything true, moment get bit overzealous one instant people looking excuse seize that, jump it, string like strawman rail day. 


I also think masks incredibly important, we're situation drastic failure things like contact tracing, etc. 


Maks nice, they're something everyone theoretically do, great there's extra layer, reality handling completely botched top-down well really getting us behind curve. he's something scientist wash masks

That probably cause. masks getting little old grungy. It‚Äôs big step getting however. Keeping kids schools long period time posts huge risks social, academic mental health. even bring kids special needs abused right one turn to. Child abuse neglect reports drastically dropped over- that‚Äôs kids aren‚Äôt neglected abused anymore. 

Yet science simply shows kids near level risk COVID older people are. recent Brown University study large number school kids teachers. 
Very low spread. People sub deny it, science it‚Äôs reported avail. 
Here‚Äôs another article naysayers breaks data - reason schools staying open Europe, even renewed lockdowns. Republicans, Trump. European governments recognize keeping schools closed hurt vastly children helps. 

It‚Äôs black white problem, complicated- I‚Äôll give that. teacher, it‚Äôs really pissing people still denying science kids schools shrugging shoulders comes deep, worrying impact keeping schools closed cause. work alot European countries? 

We terrible situation many countries even lockdowns hard restrictions months, Italy, France, UK, Spain even Belgium terrible high death rates America.

If Americans stop focus blaming Trump every single Coronavirus case actually face reality stopping virus matter restrictions take, way better of. small(compared US) countries Europe cant contain it, expect country 350M citizens so?

You slow yes guarantee even none American Trump lack power enforce restrictions states, cant held responsable individuals actions.

Pathetic read every American cry Trump every thread instead actually facing reality. 

But hey, lets hope Biden wins tonight virus gone within months, bet thats y'll think. problem contact tracing asymptomatic parents actually lie schools. dad said it'll Jan 20th! Idiocracy handful* confirmed reinfections someone tested positive recovered tested negative, tested positive again. Several cases genetic analysis virus showing different mutations definitely reinfected. 

We don‚Äôt know people different special way, common is, effect timing has, whether second infection less severe. don‚Äôt know yet! 

*By handful, mean ~5 covered extensively media find research papers reference additional confirmed cases. process confirm reinfection pretty detailed there‚Äôs extremely high likelihood catching small number cases. However could still super super rare moderately common. US hardly best example. feel people. risk death coronary artery disease immediately get CABG quad bypass.

But issue statistic people arent aware of.

And year made profit. 11000 2016, 12000 2017, 13000 2018, 14000 2019.

Now .. lets estimate ""Expected profit 2020"" is. 

10000, 11000, 12000, 13000, 14000, ...?

How that? Well .. happens look previous 5 years make average?

That would 12000. ""The average yearly profit past 5 years"".

So 2020 came along earned 15000, would look like earned 3000 ""above expected"", even though would actually completely expected, sequential point view.

Point .. sequence looking steadily increasing, averaging last 5 numbers *terrible* way predicting next number sequence be.

In short, ""Excess Deaths"" used ""predictive"" way like everyone using it. Woohoo! hard get levels checked worst phase global pandemic, taking much give kidney stones, sticking smaller dose might helpful way go people moment

People built entire careers ignorant, they‚Äôre rewarded money, fame, TV shows, book deals. so? average people dying more, lethality still greater flu folks 70? Schools still open. ok yall, poor old people dying, shit happens. Ya know, ya time time...but mean, one death many...but ya gonna do? cant let economy fall, come on! mean basically flu, we‚Äôre great, probably best, dont know, good.

YMMV enforce mask mandates. interest, average deaths per day last year? idea many die daily country 300 million people lacking health care. response people saying, ""the models show could 50,000 dead,"" back start. response people saying, ""the models show could many 1,000 dead per day,"" second/third wave first predicted?

At point start considering quality models' past performance? Biden release plan ASAP!!! can‚Äôt wait Jan! depends. stop worst? Surprised higher TBH. I'm correct counted deaths way first wave well means todays figures would highest since like April think. good Think fucking stupid average person is. realize half people even dumber that. talk policy, politics.

The mind boggling part is, 165 Million people US alone. 

To put perspective; combined populace of: Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington, Arizona, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri, Maryland, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Nevada, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, DC, Vermont, Wyoming. Singapore something like 5% roommates get it. enough resources quarantine/send people hospital endemic there.

US shitshow. couple months. bad be? 

Well, considering quickly approved Supreme Court justice ... üòí 2 9/11 every week, imagine one big memorials twice week wrong. Trump helm nothing change (possibly) January. do! 2 months, unless absolutely massive change, US likely near 300,000 dead directly due covid. Indirect deaths due inability access emergency medical services also increase significantly.

As Canadian, alternate laughing crying looking US. Laughing I'm glad make terrible choices made. Crying massive loss life. Looks really bad Ohio. bars restaurants still open?

The company work visit tend good safety training enforcement people comply. natural risk industry also helps keep people line. Actually equivalent 2,650 deaths citizen's arrest, make news beat down. Local news shine spotlight hypocrisy collect settlement troubles.

Win/win bruises broken bones heal up. experts always stated masks substitute social distancing. 

so, never asking ""am close"".

You may call mask orders unfortunate, call unfounded medical science. rediculous. Nope. seasonality like colds flus. called ""cold flu"" season colds flu.

Lmao let know hit 50M dead then, buddy. I‚Äôm running don‚Äôt bring mask use eyes see people, give plenty room 1. Get cheap rapid tests every supermarket 1 Euro per test. 
2. Enforce weekly tests every business, every school, every larger gathering.
3. Pay quarantine compensation days diagnosis, 20% real income. compensation quarantine breached, random visits least per quarantined person.

Full liability costs case non-compliance, TTI, ICUs, disability, people's lost income, everything.

Current state Germany: 5 Euros per test, 10M available per month, de facto online pharmacies, quarantine compensation bureaucratic slow, enforcement quarantine testing, liability anything.

Way go, doable. unfortunately, likely till October 2021. vaccines look promising, approved Feburary March, likely available scale till September October. Even then, mutations could prove beyond vaccines, could end virus indefinitely. Stay safe, wear mask, wash hands soon get home. proud we've accomplished. hope everyone overseas get control go back living normal life hope wrong well. 

But really hope right now, much else go on. guess see. nobody really does.

Stop projecting. need problem solutions. Kind like fuck money workin folks. sniffles Uber man genes stopped deadly virus. Keke, love little trash mountains. Ok, buddy. Enjoy nice spike whole world going right now, definitely looks nothing like one experienced starting October 1912. pregnancy risk climbs age. fertility declines. 

I think people mentally prepared fact may drag years, maybe rest lives. Also people pencilled rosiest possible outcomes, realistic ones, worst case scenarios.

I think people Reddit alive AIDS crisis. really, really shows. I'm still waiting vaccine, myself.

Fake TLDR: first mutation caused widespread vaccination, going important. yes, vaccination alters selective pressure towards novel genotypes.  mention that, labeled satanc ped people work hospitals, potential contamination far greater walking dog park. Furthermore, surgical masks disposed use. CLEANED, proper way average person clean them. Please stop encouraging people use masks feel dangerous not.

(we're really laughing.... ) Germany cannot live hiding post-war rubble forever. Although love peace, defenceless beneficial :) mean, get point is. really matter countries worse US US badly trending even worse. still seems plan. worrisome say American. 

I say even hyperbole simple fact. 

Now, get kind low key irritated people assume NY NJ going like 1000-1500 combined deaths day like worst times. shit hard believe. two states NEVER opened like Europe summer. deaths doubt like March/April. I'll eat words happen guess.

Do think deaths general get worse US? doubt it. seems like every single region getting spike deaths, moment, seem bit evenly distributed. beginning, mainly tri-state getting hit hard.

I hope, since whole nation dealing COVID now, might make us bit united it.


That said, fuck kidding. US, all, doubts. data reviewed? thy banking hopefully effective point mostly safe....sounds like Russia extra safety precautions.  translate native Australian writing.

Relentlessly test-and-trace.4. Enforce quarantine infected individuals.5. Test quarantine anyone entering abroad (citizens otherwise)

Workers border regions real headache, countries strategy, solves problem.

Finally: accept low threshold infection, that's going lead back lockdowns eventually. That's mistake made Europe, opinion. thought ok, little bit constant infection spreading. Nope - China right. cannot allowed circulate population.

Once cases 0 baseline, track trace becomes lot manageable. massive pain international travelers - that's cost avoid lockdowns, that's reasonable trade-off.

Society function normally long outbreaks. local outbreak confirmed aggressively immediately dealt with. slow ramping restrictions. appeal follow guidelines. Test everyone potentially infected squash outbreak. means rich neighborhoods stands lose policy becomes herd immunity Kissing icon mask wouldn‚Äôt change shit mean like dealership cover? sure. many months seen single bit evidence linking covid spreading protests.

It's always shit like restaurants, churches, parties, weddings, etc. etc. give 9/11? good. 

Nah. effective way public heard taken away us. 

Something tells rush reinstate this. rate increase seems going down: look like we're rapid exponential growth month ago, new cases seemed doubling every week. assume R barely 1.

That may result local lockdowns places big outbreaks. They've place weeks now, expect start seeing effects statistics. watching write this? 

/s case. Thankfully QLD still closed VIC. opened NSW except people Greater Sydney area. read going planned people Sydney meeting friends relatives Byron.  Actually total deaths least 620,000 High effort replies worth unless save later use people. feels like work feel like paid it. US normal fatality rate 8000 per day. Ah makes sense now. still get Netherlands double infection rate though, guess either another guy. normal times, there's around 1700 deaths per day France.

So we're seeing +30% increase mortality whole country. good indeed... old numbers Enjoy religious faith lockdowns ;) Marking thread comment, let‚Äôs see happens couple weeks. Going honest, J&amp;J‚Äôs history show stopper me.

It mentions New Zealand, also never high rate, small homogenous island. learn them? long lockdown? March. held October. 

It's like countries well-thought-out long-term plans. things worked. think easy complain absence strategy, nobody actually truly knows works particular country, hardly surprising politicians act short time horizon hope things work out.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide would party around bodies Something getting lost also fatality rate adjusted around 0.25%, keeps going lower lower understand way people originally thought. means year 3 million would added population, resulted 30k deaths, 300k deaths.

But ""Expected Deaths"" doesnt look last year.

It looks back FIVE years averages those.

So imagine country's deaths growing 30k year (I use abstract numbers easy math)

(Lets say ..

2015 = 200000 
2016 = 230000  
2017 = 260000  
2018 = 290000 
2019 = 320000 

So showing ""30k yearly growth"", right?

So expect deaths 2020? 

Well, obviously 30k growth would expect 350000, right? upward trend continues.

But calculate Expected Deaths *averaging* past five entries ... would say *we expect 260000*. get averaging.

So 2020 arrives ""normal growth"" 350000, would say ""That 90 THOUSAND much! averaged last 5 years expected 260000!""

Can see issue there?

If sequence steadily increasing, taking last five numbers averaging give terribly low estimation next number sequence be.

(And I'm even getting population demographics!) side note, population France [65 They‚Äôre actively trying combat virus taking aggressive measures compared America. 

The U.S. population 330 million. many people die one day France equivalent 4,000 people die one day US.

Meaning covid offset deaths least 2 1. 

On top that, anti-covid measures taken, math shows 2 million 'Americans would died covid year. sure experiment past 4 year shown leaks experiment need patched reinforced.

and [preliminary linked older post conclusion Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir Interferon regimens appeared little effect hospitalized COVID-19, indicated overall mortality, initiation ventilation duration hospital stay. 

If they're concluding statistically significant effect duration hospital stay two results really compatible all.

The seven day thing appears come 3 study treatments scheduled last days *increased* percentages remaining hospital day 7. one 3 drugs accelerated recovery sizes increases differed, not: increases strikingly similar. proportions still hospitalized day 7, study drug vs control, Remdesivir 69%v59%, Hydroxychloroquine 64%v54%, Lopinavir 68%v59% 

but mean stopped tracking things seven days. discusson Remdesivir goes say absolutely excludes suggestion Remdesivir prevent substantial fraction deaths. confidence interval comfortably compatible prevention small fraction deaths, also comfortably compatible prevention deaths (which would consistent apparent lack reduction Remdesivir initiation ventilation duration hospitalization Solidarity). 

so definitively saying multiple places reduce duration hospitalization significant way. Complacency theme today‚Äôs press conference. think majority aid supposed trickledown benevolent wealthy Americans... launch sun? Yeah there's 220,000 less people mandate manage.

I think people wear masks around others, youre straight fearmongering. remember kid neighborhood kid got chicken pox, parents sent kids play infected kids house they'd get it. Fun times. Turns sending sick people back homes good preventing transmission knew &amp;#x200B;

seasonal flu NEVER EVER 60% vaccine effectiveness (VE) recent studies show flu vaccination **reduces risk flu illness 40%¬†and 60%** among overall population seasons circulating flu viruses well-matched flu vaccine. I‚Äôve one get upset raise voice quickly rectified. What‚Äôs stupid though work people comply lot PPE requirements. Steel toed boots, hardhats, reflective vests, etc mask much them. mischaracterizing push masks straw man argue against. one says masks be-all-end-all, layer protection shown effective helping reducing transmission. Everyone also aware ""bad masks habits"" potentially contribute virus spreading, majority population masks up, even bad mask habits better masking all.

I read retraction, yes, that's pointed - point comment can't bothered check sources throw rocks straw men.  transported dry ice live world somehow promised would second wave, yes would seem like want admit one either. he?

No, promise ""no second wave""... heavily implied quick crow Sweden second wave rest Europe was.

Also, important Tegnell refuses call second wave?

Nah Biden wins, shift blaming immediately. don‚Äôt know people getting idea idea well vaccine candidates work, idea Oxford vaccine looks promising confused human beings want stay house 8 months? really confused that? like chicken pox vaccine, doesn‚Äôt make fully immune, definitely minimizes illness. Either way, great news. I‚Äôll happily get vaccine every year needed - supplies even like cologne , sex panther. Jesus, use words like that...

I‚Äôm also data nerd don‚Äôt think objective piece contextualizing data condemned ‚Äúdownplaying‚Äù. analysis seem balanced me, consider consequences alternative proposal, e.g. establishing lockdowns. Sweden took least measures deaths, also worse economic damage among scandinavian countries lockdowns led negative psychological impacts, assume probable scenario collapse healthcare system, dozens times higher death rate, de facto lockdown due fear individual citizens, would much worse psychologically well. Well that‚Äôs stupid way lose public trust. You‚Äôre right course, given trying persuade people wearing mask ALWAYS lower concentration air. think believe go outside disappears floats space.

Fascinating! Stands reason, bodies build immunity exposure widely-varied pathogens. America's obsession cleanliness overuse anti-bacterial soaps led less immunity potentially greater harm COVID-19. That's idiotic thing say: movement restriction works. They're not, restaurants spend time without mask on, churches spend lot time around group people. 

In malls, public transport, etc, there's greater movement people, even near infected person, near long, likely wearing mask. wrong, believe even crazier anti-vaxxers.

I really paid extra $60 expedite arrival new passport.   changes everything! filter exhausted air? they‚Äôre around anyone one would around enforce dumbass. ...down-ballot races thing, know. Even California, there's number close congressional races, city county races much smaller voting pools, well several propositions would massive effect people's lives.  Lmao. plenty. told people wear masks. sure counts something Even tried he'd screw up. care anyone impossible handle crisis. Look stupid events w 1000s he's putting country right now. Dumbass literally climbed 14k ft mountain mask... there‚Äôs many people backcountry days trying flip mask much bothersome wearing damn thing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wear I‚Äôm near somebody!‚Äù Ignores often run people hikes just... don‚Äôt. Literally saw multiple people covering mouths fucking hands Front Range mask mandatory locations. makes feel better, wear full face respirator anywhere im expecting breath used air, took exactly one trip Costco get feeling weird it: woman wearing one knitted/fishnet anti-compliant non-masks coughing goddamn lungs out, even pretending cover mouth.

Like fuck I'm gonna breath air, felt ultra justified decision trip. Get respirator, half-mask ones amazon less 30. I‚Äôd rather see live middle class life. Work 40+ hours week, go home clean take care kids home. Worry medical issues bankrupting family. shop budget. There's social price paid that. many places, people look askance they're 50 yards deserted street mask up.

What's worst happens? person thinks something's wrong crosses street stay away you? That's win social distancing. Democrates willing talk, Republicans instead spent time ramming Justice complaining Twitter banning racists. Counterpoint: *much* smarter Real People, even best world. Anyone who‚Äôs actually upset moron. You‚Äôre going get trouble wearing mask ones around, seeing one would around enforce it, removes ambiguity you‚Äôre near others wear it. know public ignores beg realize even young athlete, Covid cause permanent lung heart damage remove chance running competitive level ever life, right? Fucking finally. wish they‚Äôd am. makes less awkward people pull bullshit get outed immediately  doubt Democrats would support ranked choice either (I haven‚Äôt done research admittedly doubt would support something would limit power) know people 29 become another link transmission chain causing people get infected, lucky enough 29, take shit seriously right? 

Serously, fuck wrong people. Even north african countries seemed relatively control sharp peak upwards late. hospitals busy covid. Whos gonna help treat overdoses? believe satire holy shit reads much like joke Bad bot. One word taken context completely civil way.  science months old. doesn‚Äôt say risk contracting disease outside good distance held. massive conspiracy. Corporations making much money rn. That's conjecture. That's fact.  everyone behaved reasonably, completely unnecessary. 

However, people stupid, watching distance, paying attention, arguing distances put mask .... easier mandate mask times. sad, right thing do. So, say great time throw party?

For region even 400k inhabitants, 60 hospital right now, 10 ICU, 12 deaths last 14 days speak different language. testing-tracing system keeping anymore. People wait sometimes week get tested appointments. show utmost respect people, ***especially medical community***, calling totally irreparably bungled US national COVID response obviously ""too political."" Norway currently breaking records every single day regarding new infections. relatively flat long everything going shit. Sure have. slowly ramping couple weeks yes. turns slow ramp-up wave think one answer. definitely superlinear growth while. staff member leak day election buried. 

She trying safe face let go retires say ""I tried warn Trump"". live Mass. good order. nobody's enforcing mandates everybody's making excuse ""oh near people"" even nobody's getting fined nobody's getting punitive measures taken fuck yeah mask times get ticketed. people dying I'm fucking tired. u/clopzy mentioned below, separate conference government announced restricted rules restaurants: ([source 8 people would allowed sit table. determines whether celebrate Lucia, kind Christmas celebration have, says L√∂fven.  everyone must take responsibility, sake whole country.  additional budgets** also announced: SEK 10 billion set aside additional costs result covid-19 municipalities regions.  billion set aside testing operations.  curb infection joint efforts, says Johan Carlson.  large part Sweden stricter general advice local level. important everyone strictly adheres them.

Oh no. would gotten away wasn‚Äôt pesky science even incivil said  end I‚Äôd rather idiot wore mask often idiot didn‚Äôt wear enough.

That's problem country. Bad enough folks stubbornly resisting sensible precautions, country's leader setting bad example makes worse.  benefit, would rediculous pretty rapid back March too. we're dealing dramatically changed virus- following trajectory back then. yeah like public meh lockdowns Scott Atlas says blah blah blah None things mentioned affect breathing I‚Äôm panting air. reason wear mask almost entirely isolated trail run. carry one case.

Cambridge mask order months. Everyone required wear one public times, 99% people do. became political, became political people grew tired it. That's seeing people refuse wear like should. can't blame people sick them, right: minor inconvenience people need shut mask up. Masks proven work, frankly state prides smart lot really dumb people here. Sweden one highest deaths-per-capita covid world (#17). Paywalled. Make sure wear mask back yard too. We're keeping eye neighbors Southie call cops you. Also depends humidity air, temperature. Cold, dry environments like winter NE walk freezer allow spread much six feet. I'm also runner. treat mask temporary inconvenience train with. Like carrying heavy, water-filled camelbak, running humid, muggy, summer weather, training ankle/wrist weights.

The beauty inconveniences feel practically invincible remove them. Wearing mask nothing compared weights, humidity, heat. boost get temperatures drop comfortable range running amazing.

What kind distance runner can't even tolerate minor inconveniences? even bother? something easier.

Edit: mean is, running for? trying impress times? marathons road races happening days. can't adjust expectations based new mask requirements? competition with? People following rules need mandate wear masks need to. way people following rules still not, people follow rules wear mask unnecessarily outside themselves. See? /S Bars Anti-maskers also anti-vaxxers. click post history them. betting anything except think immune assessed selves ""healthy"" take everything nature throw them. vitamin C. tend think vitamin C cure-all.  Thank you! always wear mask even outside (I live downtown city). I'm outside Downtown away people, take off. shit models already plays 15-25 thousands deaths January 31st. there's one thing learned pandemic, complacency comes back bite hard. Even big island 5 million people currently ranks 166 terms population density world invulnerable. stop boasting internet ""defeated virus"", keep maintaining proper protocols hope vaccine comes early. Uh oh. ain‚Äôt good. There‚Äôs bit ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want make decision,‚Äù lot ‚Äúlook, it‚Äôs silly all.‚Äù

It‚Äôs really ‚Äúbeing sheep‚Äù feel comforted someone power tells wanted along - didn‚Äôt fear seen silly blowing things proportion - right thing do. Sigh, like warning get ready 6 months ago.

Inexcusable ignorance stupidity Well advice it‚Äôs illegal get caught. you‚Äôre setting guarantee won‚Äôt see anyone go ahead don‚Äôt wear it. see I‚Äôm snitching. :) 

We MANY laws place make cars driving safer. Permanent laws. pandemic temporary faster better follow recommendations. don‚Äôt know live county people cried mask mandate demanded ‚Äúopportunity right thing‚Äù resulted county lifting mandate turn immediately resulted people failing right thing. wish mandated nationwide. sooner, better! perfect, can't complain. great things America, need work rest. Like healthcare. Can't believe universal there. love watching American pharmaceutical commercials, though. They're great! Yeah allowed roll whatever desire, that's fucking point freedom.

And, getting dick wet we, species, goddamn procreate hell yeah activity virtually preserved costs.

I live one way another. while. Everybody gotta die sometime Red. life goal survive inevitable death.

There people say ""no"" even less people obey, eventually. sure hell fall either groups. Wow! listen to?  literally best country education, one best terms healthcare, safety, financial stability. can't tell many people moved told much better MA. really sense increase stupidity move away (according several ex-MA residents I've spoken to) Thanks unpopular opinion. Yeah fun that. Places like China Vietnam (where am) seeing deaths day gone back normal, places like US seeing close 1,000 far restrictions coming months. think makes liberal minds? Face masks causing cancer one weirdest claims I've seen anti-maskers. I've telling people awhile, seasonal virus. surprise transmission sustained summer. Remember Independence Day lot people took Friday off. Weekends less testings far, overall test rate last week 80% previous week. would wait week could see drop. We'll see isn‚Äôt enjoyable scientific benefit wearing mask around people? Get vote wear mask suggest 6 months ago. country rats nest. People state putting heads ground trying force believe heavily complying. definitely not. Every time go grocery stores find dozens employees, customers, police without masks worn badly may well wearing anything. People walking beaches downtown areas without masks, distanced. People large parties suburbs every night. schools public buildings older shitty non-existent circulation.

These things residents think about, ignore, try justify. police get attitude ask enforce masks (a lot wear begin with), health departments cracking effectively enough. selfish stupid rest country, nobody wants admit though. know it‚Äôs tempting look death meaningful metric, something affect health long term matter young healthy are. 

That isn‚Äôt even taking consideration unnecessary danger putting health care system (the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers) literally putting lives family‚Äôs lives risk order save treat people. didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsign up‚Äù either. never middle you?


What northern California.

Your generalizations inaccurate, gross believe damaging. search her, articles published today say still WH task force. would never want go one . bad enough norovirus It‚Äôs nice see cops acting consistently Massachusetts. worry, *dozens* us care like you.  Ah yes, two types people: Trump cultists black people.

You're right though. president who's pushing narrative. Tough, middle third wave global pandemic. Sorry slight inconvenience less people die. think suck up. -80C freezers commonly used preferred scientific studies. 

But -80C freezers much expensive buy. sometimes use -20C budget and/or volume samples. 

-20C normal food, changes still take place. That's recommended storage time frozen foods order months. microbially spoiled (of course) sensory properties deteriorate.  No, caution statement public. Turns there‚Äôs billions ready distribution January. Oh shit thank u I‚Äôm gonna watch sure! Theater right. see zero excuse go restaurant right now, lot businesses ain‚Äôt surviving another shut down. idk That's equal 131,461 US cases   best case though - plan best, expect worst hopefully pans out.

Parallel vaccine development, actually manufacturing/getting capability availability soon possible deemed safe. complaining ‚Äúlack deaths‚Äù? That‚Äôs horrible interesting, thx Personally don‚Äôt understand would concerned masks Doctor pointed profession wears time.

You would think they‚Äôd concerned pumping bottoms make bums look like giant soiled lumpy diapers? Stop wanting kill Americans, idiot mayors. feel like boomers worst offenders masks. right-wing wacko in-laws actually believe this. What's worse, say around nephew CP, thinks everything go back beginning year starting tomorrow. That's funny! Excellent. I've looked kind map. informative bottom slider set 20 days. else would used besides movies? science said going decrease spread sure.

Why it, houses one enforcement would impossible.

There's plenty things illegal inside home. 

So again, mandatory wear mask inside home? wear one? Appears be. It‚Äôs website accredited doctors UK, AFAIK. Locally, health department reports number Covid patients hospitalized county daily. sure national numbers available it. too. sick. don‚Äôt want forced wear mask via mandates totally healthy symptom free. Again, rapier wit yours. must hit Boy Scouts comedy night.

What going killer-app vaccine New Years? No, UK long trust people also walking along said empty trail put fucking mask sneeze comes sure, there's already bunch dip shits pre-rona can't fucking bothered cover sneeze. nasty fucks.  1000 deaths day, Easter 2927! Yip. I've asked times even know anyone it. I'm Scotland. 

I tell 53 year old dad across street died watched funeral family attended.

I tell customer ask still photos thier young daughter years ago (im photographer) never used, edited gave digital images. tears eyes editing them.

I tell one close neighbours isolation they're newborn rushed hospital breathing difficulties thankfully fully recovered.

Another friend rough months ago still hardly walk stairs flat. 37 covid fit fiddle.

I could go leave that. 

So yes real counting costs physically mentally years. thought confirming power money. Cna someone please help find website saw linked Reddit weeks ago scroll several scenarios people get infected various scenarios?

Looks like media doctors decided break truth, reinfection basically tacitly admitted Fauci, explained vaccine sterilizing. vaccine sterilizing, provokes immune response covid, covid either.

Next shoe: admitting reinfection year explicitly. Watch man, watch. cumulative damage reinfection. years life taken multiple covid infections, healthy individuals. Watch. US? legit source? 

Im assuming Oxford Vaccine 4 billion hate agree sounds harsh. miss good restaurants, seems like hard make money opening restaurant keep getting replaced chains. Even best restaurants win awards often end closing. good food product often profitable close time. lucky able buy stand alone building 1988 allows operate profitability. category. cut throat business, feel every person dream close restaurant.

But oh god, money open one, would never put money speculative investment. sounds completely crazy me. Yes well long term, many sit restaurants last 10+ years? lot places closed already.

For context, Merck working antibody treatment right course working vaccine wouldn‚Äôt really help sales.
A week two ago merck representative went german tv talked it, claimed would even work critically ill, course impossible vaccine return us normality eventually. I'm actually date vaccines.hmm hell happened El Paso..all cities decent Texas. Strange.. quick insults. Wit, much. Please. stop. Yup. Every days I'll see article something, like vitamin important.

FWIW, individual level think us would. showed doorstep needed shelter food, I‚Äôd give you. 

Unfortunately hospitals for-profit private companies, charity really isn‚Äôt thing, profit is. don‚Äôt even treat *us* well. Thanks, need still another two years dumb Trump power that's rejecting vaccine petty political reasons must read news.

US chatter trying monopolize vaccine supplies impacted dynamic. national pride may blind that, governments saying it.  Trump making mess everyone, millions people around world convinced world end rapid vaccine. ""Actually can't compare Sweden worst affected countries world worst affected parts even worse haha totally got you"".

*Yikes*.

I suppose next time compare life expectancy random ""democracy index"", totally relativize away Sweden's ranking *because countries made cities can't compare countries eachother*. Ah faaiiirrr... I'm little concerned though, 10x stronger immune response backfire way?  


Like system messes people's lives unintended consequences? straight good potential anything bad? lol, people doing? since ya'll understand viral transmission works, guys getting others way avoid risk getting rona? say fuck Quick scroll post history. Yeah, know exactly bullshit believe. Move along. Goalposts really get moved sub feels like  Directed Enhanced Service - medical speak, assume. No, trump‚Äôs idiots started demented squawking COVID going suddenly disappear Dump wins election it‚Äôll revealed COVID hoax along. vaccine comes tomorrow dems withholding lifesaving meds rig election kill republicans, definitely makes sense it‚Äôs hoax vaccine still needed. that‚Äôs definitely projection.

If 87 year old guy dies kidney failure influenza virus would considered ""death influenza"" even possibly flu make bit weaker. Yeah, lots medical professionals others done stuff like that.

Jesus, people make laugh. This.

If frozen preserved defrosted definitely risk... hurt inner math second time I've remove one comments virtually reason past half hour. Stop insulting users -- attacking argument fine, throwing around insults acceptable. would thought hospitals around world months ago. First all, system directly responsible thousands deaths us people can't afford medical attention forego price. saying is: know people dying like alternative ""crammed throat"" fantasy bullshit argument made met.

Because tell this: doctors well paid socialized countries. Like well paid. doctors union voice bargaining powers. interest interest all. doctors take new system add voice it. fears simply said bullshit. long stop cancelling big events due COVID? There's non-zero chance things contained 2021, cancelling every event indefinitely sustainable. I'm predicting June 2021 things resume, COVID not. Little know, already sheep, waiting. AOC never said that. 

Those ‚Äú130k deaths‚Äù pneumonia, heart failure, ‚Äúrespiratory distress‚Äù. Please tell think Covid kills people. think drop dead? People dying low O2 heart attacks, that‚Äôs actually kills you. Covid causing problems. 

Nearly 300,000 excess people died since start year running 10yr average. Covid?

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide  think he's overreacting tell people wear masks don't, else besides require law?

You might want read article again. He's adding mask mandate, he's extending old one, said apply.

Obviously, turning toothless mask ""mandate"" actual mask mandate, fines everything, would great, that's seems happening here. seems like failed job he's blaming people may followed law voluntarily. Austria here, really. One best-quickest responses first wave, whole summer passed like would never come back.

Work home regulation expected next year march (really).

A traffic light defined, things threatened pass yellow red intermediate color introduced (orange), apply actions already defined.

Testing tracing joke, know first hand. delay testing notifying contacts sometimes reaches full week. Ah, cases reported physical letter (because know, 1960) informing need quarantine arrives \_after\_ quarantine finished.

And also, yet another traffic light schools. whole country red, schools yellow... reasons.

So, not, would say really tried. won't. oersobally

I actually looked up. like ""oh boy, learning new word today"".

The subsequent ""yoy"" tipped off. It‚Äôs mystery. ‚ÄòDeSantis' office said it‚Äôs sharing report public ...
It‚Äôs also clear office shares report entity state, including counties, cities, hospitals universities.‚Äô decision governor counts evidence, think go way...

If take issue quality recommendations source, provide better one. provided any, better worse. Yep, safety measures take mean even accident happens, drastically reduce risk death serious injury.

I mean, I'm sure wear seat belt get car... Leaving states working sooo well always: doubt trust random guy interwebs gives two cents.  !RemindMe 60 days It‚Äôs general lack medical knowledge compounded lack trust medical knowledge. 

In severe cases causes diffuse systemic damage many organs body, lungs commonly assumed. Calling respiratory pathogen bit simple. 

It cause severe viral myocarditis trigger cardiac arrest, medically died cardiac arrest (your heart stopping) cause SARS-COV-2 infecting heart. crux misconception. people dying, even pre-existing conditions, otherwise probably weren‚Äôt going die right now. Diabetes isn‚Äôt usually acutely fatal, know, treatments it. high blood pressure conditions people use say, ‚Äúsee it‚Äôs healthy people dying.‚Äù Nevermind we‚Äôre one unhealthy developed countries world, I‚Äôd wager large portion people making comments likely ailments they‚Äôre even aware of.

It‚Äôs clusterfuck bad faith thinking poor rationalizations grounded proper perspective general medical knowledge. key politicization whole pandemic, phenomenons occurring.

As someone who‚Äôs followed plight healthcare professionals closely deepest empathy towards horrors they‚Äôve faced, genuinely implore reach educate people much possible. won‚Äôt reach everyone, it‚Äôs truly unfair place burden them, public keep hearing dealing virus every day push beyond latent distrust portion population. People dying alone COVID wards without families, often find via phone call, nobody immune go hardship. virus spreads deeper, families suffer consequences unmitigated spread continuing strain fatigued medical professionals. 

Truly horrible situation. Yeah no. Wearing mask outside me. Whether state tries make ""mandatory."" need mandates stuff like putting seatbelts, speed limits, etc large enough portion population dumb. Bullshit.

We crumple zones (social distancing), seat belts (hand washing) air bags (masks). plenty things reduce risk dying car crash. think general reasoning staffing store anyway, remain open? 3-4am, cashier anyone front -- check out, find stocking clerk ring up.

Maybe depends union rules. Denver's main supermarket chain, King Soopers, 100% 24 hour acquired Kroger. close wee hours morning reopen 5. wonder Kroger's union rules different? voted today small town pa polling place. 100% mask compliance 20 voters present without noses showing. 

Out 4 workers: waiting polls officially open 4 walking around without masks. 

6:59am (I voter #10)- 3 workers put masks sh!t 3 noses showing. kicker, oldest unhealthiest one literal amputation stayed without mask.  

Mercia... feel bad business owners, could use real jobs town. ""Infections spiked Russia, authorities Tuesday reported 18.648 new infections""

...""Spiked"" 18257 yesterday, 18665 day yesterday. mean, means rosy figures would significantly higher testing (hell, I'm heading deliver stuff friend who's sick corona), kind sensationalist reporting help anyone. Yes, federal government print kind money. 

But give us want us get back work allow everyone get infected naturally, letting virus run course crossing fingers herd immunity.

But states want kind blood hands, forced create public health guidelines without federal support. provide state support state unemployment. enough really.

So do? States can't print money. Federal government give money clear care many get sick, want go back work unemployment numbers look better. give money, hungry enough risk life community health. withhold. accident. let states take blame cost infections. Together news, good reason doubt. True January/February much opportunity reinfection. I'm talking state level, I'm talking general. 

Neither political party wants give support ranked choice loss power them. Ranked choice first step (hopefully) towards 2 viable winners elections. addition vaccinating vulnerable population, herd immunity thing necessarily need vaccinate every single person. Many thought impossible.

We really know common is. That's what's scary. could spring us. no? would expect people already previous exposure flu partial immunity. Covid novel virus, people specific immunity would susceptible it. Oh boy. Another video saying immunity lasts presence antibodies. Guys, know misinformation. obtained reusable mask past 8 months, that's literally given away dozens happily give away need. several ready go one needed them.

It's good charitable needy, thank that.

Again, whatever someone legally obtain obtain may hands. linked study showing masks breeding grounds diseases accepted people need basic items, discount needs others see daily.

Would accept use shirt mask? foresee lots people trying distance near future. evidence support wearing mask outside. wear mask outdoors. encourage stayed houses entire pandemic working home scared stiff going outside stay inside duration winter next year. come malls, public transport, subway trains, buses magically excluded? Depends. point withtin next 7-14 days, we'll probably see virus slow new measures. Balkan - people afraid promaja corona believable still emergency need surgery. Like appendicitis. Wearing pants nobody around also anything bet still it. completely disrespectful families dead people working dead, I'd say open morgue trucks coroner's offices forced tours people caught partying, wearing masks, etc.  fucking idiotic. around people big groups absolutely reason repeat NOOOOOO reason wearing mask. around others within distance coughing sneezing aerosolized ways yes absolutely help protect others lowering potential viral load. nationwide standard since day 1. can't even get easy thing like right, little hope global warming situation.  pull neck warmer. winning numbers! hate see NYTimes using spam article techniques ""This Agonizing Choice""... say headline instead fishing clicks.  Yes. shopping 10pm 5am concern. 

It's cutting 10pm-2+am night owls partying even wanting congregate. 

And businesses take advantage loopholes single others. We've seen time time again. 

If single 'bars', people flock restaurants places undoubtedly stay open later opportunity. Close bars restaurants, places like sporting gaming places staying open later. Close down, people find somewhere else go. 

So understand nothing mindset. There's in-between. People want go something find place that's open...unless nothing open. give kind nonsense credence may well want look mental health... guess hand washing / shaking hands. Covid prefers spread airborne particles care much hands, unlike flu.

Or maybe Covid would actually spread much better without hand hygiene, still useful both? It‚Äôs unproven FDA approved. believe Argentina‚Äôs leaders accepting bribes. Prayers entire fucking midwest holy cow. sustained thats 60kish deaths end year. Nothing much, fill large stadium thats whos going die. Removing putting mask increases chance spread. can‚Äôt believe many people saying going away election. really believe it‚Äôs bull every country earth it. is. None current rules enforced, Baker want enact actual mandates, wants pretend like he's something. Meanwhile, let college students come back they're wearing masks, partying time, etc. public school many days need read parents allowing kids drinking parties right now? Cops shit part people wear masks, even inside establishments. kind makes feel uneasy. vaccines might effective ones future. get best one get better one later wait get best first time? Well shitshow. much job numbers. anything he's waaaay second amendment. could life normal minimal deaths high risk take extra precautions everyone else deals flu get it. Fuck it. sacrifice em all. got economy rights uphold. /s Yeah, cross nation EU health insurance often coordinated. work UK live Germany export national insurance payments (mandatory healthcare) UK Germany collected source. Many cross border workers using simple form. hard arrange thankfully.
Here's hoping foreign nationals wind German hospitals make home safe recovered! Elementary schools town went back five days week yesterday. Today, one schools already shut quarantine.

Oops. China claiming lot lives without ever firing missile Parents need grow eff up. pandemic, one schedule worse 1918 Influenza outbreak. stop acting selfishly keep kids home *save thousands millions people get choice.* Mind, people getting exposed, i.e., doctors, nurses, teachers, principals, essential workers pay tax money toward brats' ""education."" Hospitals country getting overwhelmed idiots chose free babysitting (and let's honest, that's parents want schools open, protect ""black people's"" education article suggests).  

Unless kid needs special ed extenuating circumstances, i.e., abusive broken home, parents excuse. No, ""need"" go work (and often receive special treatment remote assignments) trump someone else's need work. Frankly, I'm getting sick tired parents playing card, though they're *only* people planet mouths feed. Meanwhile, *zero* problem sending kids school daycare making teachers/workers ill, forcing *them* take time *lose* job altogether. also get perverse sense enjoyment making people ill complaining much ""taxes"" pay ""unreasonable"" wages. 

No sympathy pampered middle-class brats. Rather, sympathy goes doctors, nurses, teachers, grocery/personal shoppers, delivery guys, trash collectors, etc., keeping us afloat get choice. Maybe I'm introverted homebody this, mental health never affected all. lockdown, gaming exercising own. over, life resumed work attending group martial art classes, going gym, dining in, going movie theaters.

Sure Tokyo Olympics 2020 trip canceled, life goes besides PS5 comes next week. Gamers ones resilient pandemic. parents, Georgia working ICU covid patients 6 months, visiting family Wisconsin coming home. mom, dad, grandma covid, bunch family members likely well. 

Wear fucking mask, even around family. keep mask get back apartment , easier I'm lazy, plus keeps touching face eyes. Well national health institute said non medical masks effective before.

Not trying get arguments whether do. see people convinced, least confused. Yeah, read lines hermano. buy shit government sells you. talking vaccine marketed 100% safe working without showing phase III data LOL. agree necessary state currently mandated? makes sense.  reaching governors tell to.  Think dumb average person is, remember half people world even dumber that! \~George Carlin, probably exact quote. Hey, want point Americans type selfish, dont think fair measure selfishness. problem person spent entire political career telling supporters news lies, scientists wrong, answers. 

So hear news saying virus dangerous. scientists saying need wear masks stay apart. hear leader saying ""nah, fake news, cold,"" guy makes sense doubt hear. honesty, train thousands covid-sniffing dogs. literally trained 30 days. Even 80 90% accurate, that's lot better 32%. People may scoff kind low-tech method. sometimes back wall need rely what's tried &amp; true. 0% wearing mask

a mask put risk zero, know. want take extra steps reduce already low risk outdoor spread, that's totally cool! think dumb force people though. focusing efforts mitigating higher risk activities. see outdoor festivals open air concerts happening next summer, maybe security theater ‚ÄúMasks required‚Äù ie wear gate don‚Äôt enforce And? see avoided point.  Current Science says wearing mask outside okay.  bug,its feature /s I'm glad to. Idk plane crash every day I'd pretty damn worried Monday 25% higher previous Monday. Almost *all* Monday's ""flattened"" relative preceding numbers week including Saturday.

This Monday actually exceeded weekly curve. 20% higher previous Monday kept pace rest week. state 105k would expected following curve utter nonsense. She‚Äôs stopping Atlas. York State State didnt ask served purpose, asked net-benefit outweighs loss ‚Äúgood‚Äù actor system. It‚Äôs easy question cause it‚Äôs impossible know sure, feel anger towards birx misguided. Two friends chatting bit outside dangerous. disagree, urge research open mind learning. Sure. driving 5 MPHS getting car, wearing football uniform ways it, well. would absurd. Much like many advocating here. case never informed people see something important without freaking it. reason change talking points base thriving current offering. republicans given trying win voters. think point want fire existing base much possible odd zealotry Monday show flattening. 105k new cases following curve. Yet wasn't. Granted, still meaningless statistically since one day. admit that. shall see. Really? Who? point stands though-a hiking trail middle woods weekday going empty. empty mom's 50 wooded acres. need wear mask??? people downvote legit questions?

Yellow green drip sounds like bacterial infection. may still need see doctor, phone first.

General advice: wash masks hot water (if use re-usable masks); use several masks day, put masks use sunlight.  realise quoting article US article OP specifically UK. need /s that... getting louder easyer accepting wrong. Admitting wrong self really really hard. well get that. personally use discretion worked far. keep distance outside open air-I take off. can't put Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

/r/selfawarewolves forget people imagine reasons, course going uncomfortable. Yeah autocorrect error. margins small consumed debt payments. means control! build temporary hospitals instead moving infected people across country? One major mistakes SARS Hong Kong started moving infected people different hospitals instead concentrating efforts one, moving temporary hospital. decade life, two, hypothetically? 

How many years give eating out? dying covid major risk, dying early complications repeat covid infections. Fauci admitted reinfection, basically.

Admitted = admitting equivalent vaccine protect infection. means immune response infection prevent reinfection time. Assuming articles claiming equal better immune responses true. anyone relative that‚Äôs fucking moron? middle Armageddon nothing, respect extremes. wear mask part. respect however people refuse admit 100%cl compliant human needs like socialization. 

We discussing thanksgiving aunt says isn‚Äôt comfortable fine clearly comfortable basically admitted phone skirting quarantine twice one many weekend trips apparently comfortable going family events. she‚Äôs shaming people things. miserable lady literally said ""not saying herd immunity"". catch one? guess not. Try reading again. moved youngest living family 21 years it‚Äôs hard them. roommate isn‚Äôt afraid getting covid really want able visit mom dad elderly cat loves much. 
If got rapid test done one day would safe visit day? say predict flatten. said already started, fact growth rate accelerated right including yesterday. Saying new cases begun flatten outright falsehood. 

Remind 1 week. always amazes harmonized talking points are. Something I'd never heard before, sudden every Republican talk says exact thing. scary, honestly. Ever hear word socialism anymore? Nah, Marxism boogeyman. even subtle, straight programming cult. Thank reporting edited title, appears site likely edited title post made, we'll leave up. easy dismiss risks stay uninformed. kind ppl who're dining gathering friends &amp; family large settings reddit get news FB feeds. Especially California there's sense among suburbs virus ""controlled."" 

And political viewpoint. even open-minded progressives SoCal think let guard they're experiencing Fall Surge, unlike ""Red"" states who're getting comeuppance. Well plus Covid brand new cause near #1 daily deaths country. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs serious threat interest, understand that. It‚Äôs people care sudden new causes death... like shootings Covid. daily quiet killers main sources death... drop drop erosion deaths.. it‚Äôs really interesting enough people. I‚Äôve lots restaurants accommodate 20+ people going company get togethers. new restrictions might make difference pizza places. real Debbie Downer. Yeah 75-80 best case scenario, we‚Äôre probably going end mid high 50% according experts goes right today, nothing happen end January See 2 months. Yeah, god forbid people actually something enjoy. assholes, dare they. orange baby gets back you‚Äôre fucked. people getting infected getting it, granting immunity winter months.

Dude, TINIEST percentage USA COVID far. talking ""herd immunity""? lunch. Stop spewing dangerous BULLSHIT. wasn‚Äôt really asking opinion."
