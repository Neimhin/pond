One could add hundreds local production sites, proves effective. mean, said know protocol Oregon. suggesting separating people based living situations, I'm saying talking people live home interact handful people teachers, teachers higher risk group. seem like we're talking that, though. Interesting it’s side effects varied. none whatsoever shot 1, even sore arm. Shot 2 pretty sore tired days.

My wife sore arm made fun complaining arm long. Don’t believe Usually February-May September-November. June-August, they’re usually night races South. Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Delaware summer races would trust immune system would trust man made mass produced experimental non FDA approved product. opinion, common sense.  long? Genuinely curious right time don’t need social distance longer. Humans social creatures, promise vaccine resume normal life. covid news India depressing stuff I've ever heard. like story worse one before. co-workers APAC team devastated thing. 

Some heart breaking stories Indian coworkers. One dead mom another everyone family clan COVID least Sputnik seems effective vaccine. seem lack uniformity comes quality control however... That's big 'aside from'. Indoor mask requirements still big deal.

What Egged buses require them? fine squashing rumor. think around vaccinated people hurt you, please PLEASE stay away us.  I’m looking true. It’s interesting hear someone dismiss doctor says wrong days. medical establishment put pedestal Covid, hear great deal “trusting experts. ER doctor’s anecdotal experience usually would qualify expert. never take one Dinner date got canceled me! gonna tough maybe blessing disguise. risk all? Isn’t prudent take “better safe sorry” approach?
 
And wtf matter US country isn’t doing? We’re talking one country, country’s stance matters. disparage others’ experiences figured I’ll share less extreme reaction balance out. drowsiness spells 2 days shot minor headache. classic sore arm actually worse first shot second

Husband nothing sore arm, complained apparently doesn’t even get flu shot! don’t feel like getting tracked government big tech, duh. 

-posted Facebook using iPhone 12. I'm interested either. politicized point repulsion. protection vulnerable Covid

Like who? Ontario we’ve LTC’s retirement homes immune yet cases ICU admits still climbing, I’m curious know exactly think vulnerable point. People lungs? would let ? Send back Another michigander here. I've got second shot scheduled Monday, wish luck! appreciate information! Thank u Thank face masks sounds like could good. wonder woud work inside ventilation air ducts? Can't wait see numbers May 10 17. earliest possible dates remaining people could second shot ""all adults"" floodgates opened.

Not Massachusetts actually, states - since think latest date last states already, one. passports invalid anyways. cant discriminate non vaccinated, like cant discriminate person. human immune system bad cannot trusted help protect without addition unknown mRNA spike proteins various foreign elements introduced body? Mentioning one politician another apportioning blame might one reason.

The politicians certainly helping, seem interested silencing truth, strange see many hospitals taking court supplies, seemed lax people paying price, sad situation, you’re seeing lot positive community effort light failure medical system places, wish best. wonder anything vaccinations.... Talk folks know anti vaccine. garbage RNA unfamiliar folks. RNA treatments future, crazy science evolutionary.  claim treatment quality make much sense. I'd say demographics (although aging, Turkey still relatively young country, people +65 around %8 population, compared +%20 Western European countries, death rates mostly age group). Unconstitutional Democrats, right? (Not american) access vaccines

Like fifty feet sofa aisle pharmacy?  Das dat new strain Alabama got hit really hard Covid last year. ""not chance second one yet""? They're scheduled together. call Rogan surge. Well probably idiots pressuring take dose number one. What? realize Australia mandatory quarantine system? intercepts inbound travellers tests vigorously it. point “putting citizens risks makes zero sense. Also, wasn’t ban flights US registering 200k + cases? convinced persuaded otherwise? even solution? must beyond frustrating trying help. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Trust me, we're surprised. Right, sure... can't vaccines first time round, right? might go back again, vaccines like 80% effective presently prevalent strains (less SA variant) still leaves 20% population susceptible, 14 million people (assuming 100% vaccination escape variants). *hope* go again.

My point just: fall deaths clearly joint consequence restrictions vaccinations. Loneliness hopelessness helps covid kill people. overweight? assume **probably similar new zealand**, **will setting specific quarantine facilities arriving india hotspots**.

As Australian ...

ahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  US fewest number new cases 7 months. things continue 7 day average might drop 50k tomorrow, Monday. People getting flu shots decades &amp; strains flu still eradicated,so people think Covid vaccines eradicate Covid? came back day trip Michigan. 90% people wearing masks... stupidly amazing. I’m glad wore mask despite fully vaxxes I'm talking old people nursing homes. stated first comment. contributed 50% deaths. absolutely good reason lockdowns. vaccines need either. least extent pushing marketing them. Especially something experimental are. mentioned healthy people seeing long term side effects virus, long term side effects vaccines? know people dealing bad effects vaccinated people bad case covid. Almost twice many. I'm saying, information wrongly discredited, suppressed, withheld, manipulated since day one. find hard believe anyone would deny that. quite obvious. Mostly long term studies effects vaccines. got myself, understand people would choose get it. suspect it’s factors reinforcing other. “No so-called expert going tell do” longstanding Southern stance, it’s Republican one well.

There still 20-25% assholes never get vaccine, I'm confident Michigan comply get magic 70% number July 4th. well....I know OP said that.....

People pretending everything okay attempt go back normalcy. Far, far, far many Americans anti vax anti mask both. going ""good great shape"" long time side effects alarming would got shot now.

Getting home still incredibly difficult expensive, banned coming back Taiwan, threat jail time. I'm furious. wasn’t aware Australia welded anyone apartment complex, checked temperatures randomly street, forced people tested, forced positive people go state run isolation facility. sort extreme measures talking would acceptable many countries Please reinstate comment. removed stoke fear help push agenda. end first lockdown took September cases start rising again. completely unvaccinated population. doubt go again, maybe cases deaths shouldn’t Technically, UK strain becomes dominant strain would help reduce infection rates strains like Brazil South African strains right? assumption get infected Uk strain cannot infected strains time evolutionary pressure vaccine resistant strains. There's nothing hear. data shipments crystal clear. even remotely. Apparently loud enough people back states highest vaccination rates getting hit hardest right now, michigan one People sign rest lives.

We're literally &lt; 8 weeks away people second health care system back normal. 

Except worst provinces.  literally said that...  Right decline cases deaths happened months, lot restrictions remain place (office workers still WFH, pubs, restaurants etc.) recently lifted. took bunch time cases rise end first lockdown. I'm saying obviously mainly vaccine effect -- hard disentangle isolate things.  high vaccination states allowed ban people low vaccination states entering. prevent high vaccination state residents travelling low vaccination states. inept Canadian government says go 3-4 months first shot, excuse enough vaccines.

Actually NACI, model UK, no-brainer data 1-shot efficacy positive. on? There's enough doses coming end ***june*** ~60% population second dose. people diverse cultures East Asia South Asia ""honor cultures"" saving face important, they're ones gigantic rates teen pregnancy, obesity, divorce, illegitimacy, anti-education attitudes. 

In fact, South Asian East Asian cultures prove obsessed saving face honor pro-education. Also, cultures full binge eaters stuff face deep fried twinkies.  get vaccinated, trend continue. Vaccination Demographics update 2021-05-01

It's almost Southerners look people world doing, consciously try emulate abusive, backwards, destructive cultural facets. Well problem conservative vaxx scepticism, Trump would best individual reach them. Certainly impact Biden Fauci. Friend lung damage doctors think may permanent. Brother law kidneys shut down, may early onset parkinsons.  trouble getting appointment mine almost 3 weeks since opened everyone, I’m Michigan. think it’s heavily dependent live, demand outpaces supplies one asking Australia open lax borders, reasonable allow return citizens given know mitigation techniques PPE, quarantining, testing. Texas FL pretty open mask mandates. Cases currently declining. What's reason difference? state in? Walgreens, CVS maybe Rite Aid let sure. explain moved proof first dose. say ""living home"" mean homebound? wasn’t open young people Michigan April 5th. places people still trouble finding appointments, even gotten still first shot. There’s also less young people signing like say, let’s see couple months first vaccine get best one you.  

The pandemic urgent even though feel safe home.  

Staying pretty safe guarantee. still need buy food, fire alarm could go off, could tooth ache medical emergency, someone know could emergency need help, something like smog test could come timer it.  reasons beyond control make hunkering home sure thing.  vaccine helps that. 

Also, always get different kind vaccine next time. luck next vaccines become available tailored specific variants circulating time. Seems like he'll definitely legacy. Also easier ignorantness constantly reinforced. Fox News Facebook echo chambers time Galileo. Good see reopening certain places Europe. Massive props DC first blue area actually balls suck CDC's manipulative dick. hope bowser never rescinds mask mandate gen pop excluding U16, force anti-vaxxers make choice socially distancing wearing mask life getting jab returning 2019. really care much since covid effective, want set precedent next pandemic (which probably occur lifetime current 18 year old). vaccine effective, we'd need others vaccinated want set precedent cutting unvaxxed vaxxed. got vaccine Oregon! much supply yet schedule 5 days advance drive 30 minutes so... I’m familiar. Ironically, though, thalidomide never approved use US FDA blocked it. Well, China lockdown 2 months pandemic, originally spend 6 weeks trying cover hide it. little curb initially yes locked everyone inside. Ah, gotcha. Thanks pointing out. don’t know much lol. Still unfortunate one years. happened him?

He found easiest audience please Covidiots use ""prove"" covid deaths really obesity deaths. 🤦‍♂️ Nobody forces pick bottle coca-cola feed infant gonna go shitty parenting  wtf talking about, anything, long overdue vaxxed folks  get free frogurt! could side effects could Norovirus. husband nasty bout, exact symptoms accept reality (in terms company protecting litigation well guaranteeing payment) doesn’t make less screwed up. Coming guy posted ""[Why Americans r/explainlikeimfive. I'm sure assertion US ""completely fucked"" based credible sources scientific pragmatism, obvious anti-America biases. Nope one came UK. idiot visited UK didn’t quarantine upon returning home. infected number people spread like wildfire. There’s probably variants spreading around technically celebrated 4 times course 12 years. location changes every time location hosts every 12 years.  Yep. Believe do. Every story side. agree him. girlfriend horrible reaction first vaccine I’m hoping gets second. I'm honestly pissed abt mask mandates fully vaxxed people. Two weeks day second pfizer shot started wearing mask nose. feel like I'm wearing mask since I'm breathing nose one confrontational enough say anything \*mostly\* wearing mask. honestly care people feel uncomfortable, long I'm capable spreading, give zero shits feelings. surge anything it?



My second shot give headache comparable weekly migraine so......  hygiene indicator well handle pandemic. Notice Japan, Korea, Singapore. stop wearing masks doctors (AMA, NIH, NHS, CDC, EMA) tell us it’s safe stop wearing them. don’t know hard understand. healthcare professionals know said masks probably last well 2022. back 2020 vaccine started becoming available. knew would take years vaccine produce enough herd immunity forgo masks, social distancing, increased hand washing. 

You sound like boomer complaining seatbelt laws. single person would rather wear mask indefinitely, everyone wants return semblance normal. reduce vectors virus surest way follow doctors world recommending. Get vaccine, wear mask, keep socially distant, wash hands, avoid touching face. start every day grateful don’t need machine breathe you, someone town, neighborhood, even family probably can’t breathe today. parents fault, system's letting corporations design drinks equations addiction children? Moderna 3.3x dose pfizer think part it. Hopefully get boosters approved lower less harsh dose. Pretty much everything said false. going comment HCP Indiana. idea bad MI started seeing many people getting transported Lifelined central Indiana treatment. enough coming without US cover that. Honestly it’s incredibly unlucky religious festival happens every 12 years ended year. Thats parents fault Churches lots singing open You’re fucking kidding right? Psychosomatic? Give break man. Go talk young runners still barely get flight steps. Research came non hospitalized cases 60 percent likelier die 1-6 months covid without they’re also much likely receive new primary diagnosis. I'll sure tell 3 year old me.  virus food. pandemic really uniting threat political division. Yes LOL that’s fair, understand sentiment. useful comparison. Old people vaccinated makes sense younger folks ones getting sick. got vaccine first day available me, that’s eager get it. 

1st shot Moderna: extremely sore arm couple days, nothing else. 

2nd shot: Fever lasted 60 hours. completely useless day shot take day off, fever, aches, 0 energy, horrible headache. 

I don’t regret getting vaccine, curious long term. need boosters yearly shots, don’t see people going lining take forces feel like shit take work (this gonna huge hurdle). objective truths, know? I've read planeload unvaccinated people kept taking masks off. guess disagree facts lol, typical honestly young people seem traveling country ton now, seem tired staying tell get new flu vaccine year? ever flu before? answer mutations. brand new virus. mutation. Coronaviruses around thousands years. logic, one get infected. do. mutations.

Are aware vaccines work well newer variants. possible? insist vaccinations stop virus. relevant question? Yeah cynicism cheap, I've got outrage sale. Lol, say all. Lol lol lol  I'm sure lot places good social pressure enough people right thing. I'm glad got decent area. opposite true. wrong kind local culture lead behavior I'm seeing here. I'm also sure totally unique area. ""hoax."" That's all. people cannot stand virus put Trump's incompetence malignant narcissism display way impossible ignore. denial. french say, cutting le nose spite le face. youre saying, based actual evidence, much higher 30% states. got lol ""There's inscription inside front jacket every Australian passport. calls protection assistance citizens they're strife abroad. 

*""The Commonwealth Australia… requests may concern allow bearer, Australian citizen, pass freely without let hindrance afford every assistance protection may stand need.""* 

Who would thought Australians struggling ""pass freely"" back country? Re-entering living nation basic aspect citizenship. right return recognised international law, enshrined Universal Declaration Human Rights. 

But problem stranded Australians can't argue UN treaty Australian court. Citizenship rights - many freedoms - guaranteed law. Australia lacks human rights charter explicit protections constitution. 

So emergency situation, government make something criminal offence overnight. height pandemic last year, government beefed Biosecurity Act give health minister near unconditional powers bypassing parliament. 

That's citizens trying flee danger zone face jail trying come home. legal challenge two-week ban take time costly - public outrage pressure may effective that, face 5 years jail. think though protect people abiding restrictions part, ok. Canada they've letting lot people high risk countries causing massive spread variants. pisses face everyone stayed home, masked social distanced. people 80 vaccinated personally know 2 coworkers gotten COVID vaccinated. 

One fully vaccinated least 1 month. 

The one dose two dose vaccine. vastly underestimating number people wear masks. going submit studies done by, *checks notes*, every credible study, told bold claim likely anything, I'm going assume want debate good faith wasting time. China complete lockdown science even worked. point caring human lives group eventually affects individual. keep hearing this, actual data exist proving fully vaccinated people transmit virus? so, seen it. Insane indeed. People went India months ago could foreseen crazy wave. visa expires? could people go home country allow return? No, not. OoM isn’t calculated counting digits. It’s done exactly /u/mittenciel demonstrates: grouping nearest logarithm. Brazil's leader friend democracy, probably help. won't. Look India. They've got new variant reports Israel vaccinated people still getting infected it
 India massive religious festival five million people gathered. us churches super spreader events mega spreader (literally millions infected). give three weeks start detection strain everything goes back locked down. totally new type vaccine really used though? looked results, said, politicized people going lie. We're already seeing Gen Z underperforming vaccinations. Whether say bluntly never get vaccinated never get around care, end result. won't. Look India. They've got new variant reports Israel vaccinated people still getting infected it
 India massive religious festival five million people gathered. us churches super spreader events mega spreader (literally millions infected). give three weeks start detection strain everything goes back locked down.  Yup... US completely fucked. Pretty funny watch everyone celebrating right  opposite? mRNA better? 22% children can’t get vaccinated. 20+% won’t get vaccinated. 

We’re hitting herd immunity summer. yea tell havent looked actual results elsewhere country hesitancy numbers way higher lmao. im talking 30% range convenient. 11% vs 15% statistically insignificant people giving replies politicized issues like this. may remember 4-5 ago guy election polls said like 2% probability. survey good amount people tell want hear. Actually I've heard takes practical act God get men punished raping children India. That's become high profile case make court, part police turn blind eye side males. Maybe research trying claim cultures views towards women resulting crimes women completely unrelated live Michigan also mostly experience. got COVID spring really nbd. isolate 2 weeks certainly ordinary, symptoms mild. 

Other mask wearing, life pretty normal family past year.  

I know COVID really big deal small percentage population don’t want diminish pain suffering caused others, people interact life mostly normal.  

My kids still go school, wife still go work. 80s option stay home rather go work. Solid point :) way, can't see open year again. totally botched this. Toronto area high case count still lock door dining. extended lock down, us nice Canadians going riot. way behind vaccinations worse cases per capita compared USA. work American companies, first understood pandemic would issues visting back forth carries on, lot Canadian companies going lose work Americans can't come Canada see equipment built. Masks limit far infected person spread virus. Masks also protect uninfected getting virus less viral load coming contact virus.

Since people asymptomatic spread virus without knowing it, everyone needs wear mask protect other.

The reason person wear mask point pure selfishness. First thing said too... Agreed. Stupid people well-meaning nice. not. malignant narcissist monster. daily basis customers say don’t need mask lick envelope shots... excess mortality numbers Turkey?    Except actually big pectoral muscles begin secondly upsets exact right sort people want upset.

Cursed reluctant unabiding recalcitrants ! Texas great! mean good amount people live 80 is, again, terribly flawed stat. Even though live AZ family fully vaccinated, unless it’s small family gathering fully vax members, don’t go anywhere without mask assuming go anywhere all. great news, PA Finally Hit 50% population vaccinated first dose, top 10 states first dose.

The next state hit 50% California 49.2%. hoping vaccines work, pointing vaccines along restrictions work. think US 20x deaths cases UK despite marginally behind terms numbers vaccinated? Might something much stricter social distancing regulations? effects vaccine covid correlation.  could vaccine miraculously heal nerve damage? takes months.. multiple stories saying Tylenol specifically avoided receiving dunno maybe don’t outright recommend everyone. got first shot 10 days ago. wife 33 weeks pregnant comfortable getting vaccine delivered since obgyn confident sample size first found wife pregnant seen anything months since promoting pregnant women receive anyone information? incidence rate I’ve seen US fewer 10000 caught covid post vaccine Also ""I propagating virus"" admitting already Covid... lots double-speak. Nonsense. There's literally indoor social mixing allowed. can't visit friends family dinner cup tea. Cinemas, theatres, clubs, remain closed. come deaths keep increasing despite cases hospitalizations continually going down? vaccine prevent long covid? must outlier - Data suggest majority infected individuals develop robust long-lasting cell immunity Michiganders traveling like everything normal. Cali’s word meant much live Michigan. track meet son. Majority school team wearing masks. hosting team....I didn’t see any. students parents alike. Overheard one guy phone explaining someone website go print medical exemptions vaccines. disgusting. similar side effects felt better roughly 44 hours second shot. Felt fine first 15 hours crummy that. makes sense. 1st, people age 80 less 5% population. People age 40 50% population. 2nd, older people given priority vaccination.

But look, important part: hospitalizations Michigan Covid falling rapidly, well past peak. Things improving get better. Covid fear porn needs stop. Can’t guys get vaccine now? sanctioned verify medical records. That's true. United states not. may want think medical records remain private confidential. want data trail left lying around everyone know health conditions discriminate sale corporations trying make money you? idea vaccine passport completely absurd soon shot down, good reason. great right thing eventually months stalling :/ Happy we’re able help principle things avoid cognitive dissonance. Ive thought severe overreaction covid year now, best thing could ignore it, getting vaccine contrary this. Also skeptical open back nominal percentage people get vaccinated. worth im liberal work. many times people 40 80. assume half people (50%) 40, vs maybe 5% 80   82% 65 vaccinated first dose, assume seeing huge drop deaths coming weeks? pharmacist, I'd recommend talking doctor combination laba/ics inhaler, already one. drastically reduce overall lack ability breathe lessen amount rescue inhaler need. 

While professional knowledge, actually dealing asthma without realizing happened need follow pulmonologist nodule lung (wound cancer, thank God). workup, figured severe obstructive sleep apnea asthma.

Started breo walk without getting winded, mildly strenuous activity longer causes cramp up. Super life changing, can't recommend highly enough.  need vaccinate everyone twice least help No, understand. Teachers teaching Oregon time. risk group all. Kate could authorized shots first seniors. teachers. opened schools. wanted say opening schools asap even though teacher unions made schools opened quite time that. say opening schools without also saying teachers eligible shots.

But even Teachers teaching(which case), average age teachers way lower seniors. lot seniors staying isolated homes. exposed daily covid risk live kids worked essential jobs grandkids governor trying push back schools. grandparents situations way higher risk teachers average werenway younger. Buh, buh, Joe Rogan said... buy condom you’re going wear it? much ""export ban"" typical sense. 

Well result's it? Oregon barely hospitals... reason see lockdown since case counts don’t seem high all, even adjusted population. exported much earlier. Stricter restrictions still UK given significantly lower baseline. think many US realize open compared UK Europe, even stricter states. mean UK opened outdoor dining couple weeks ago heavy restrictions inter-household socialization, even outdoors, recently well. Meanwhile US state indoor dining open 50% since last summer almost zero actual restrictions socialization, I'm pretty middle pack state policy case-load wise. coat inside nose, throat, lungs, virus take hold? week two

Doubt it. think many people state New York eat restaurant day, 25% reduction massive. reduces likelihood super spreader event. know driving force behind pandemic small number people infect lot people. people infect someone else. tyrannical liberals so... analogy vaccines like deadlifting squats whatever immune system! authorized emergency use approval 2 completely different things. Authorized mean approved. cannot legally mandated something FDA approved. say again, fact check that. shots barely sore arm. Covid March 2020. hell, genuinely afraid wasn’t going wake 3 specific times. 
I’m sure guess preferred. Compelling argument, wrong.  Soo... 0.023% population vs 0.015% population infected? actually large difference?  Private info viewed sanctioned view it. airline official sanctioned verify you’re vaccinated purpose admitting plane. personal information like identity whether you’re no-fly list. credit card number used buy ticket. know, work state regulated facility regulations dont require wearing masks need vaccinated. shut down. auditors state officials time. understand virus, person's rights, person's privileges, regulations way related other. stay lane stay theirs. Otherwise, would bad business. Look hospitals. It’s 10. Want fuck around look like India? Oh god, already hear 5-Minute Crafts spraying Frebreeze masks..

lol mate! BMR 1300? need cut 1,000 100's lose. 100's lose, BMR 1300. What's more, going burn extra calories depending active throughout day. agree. anyone says anything remotely similar said /r/portland subrebbit would crucified. women getting high farts

let end, fun. got drag everyone dirt you

It's over. excuses sad recluse, back life need additional shots variants? variants stop world vaccinated? Israel well opened boarder new India variant... live house bill gonna shoot discriminating mandates make illegal employers, businesses, schools, like discriminate people unwilling comply. good reason. Nate Silver still smart though. December 11, 2020, U.S. Food Drug Administration issued first emergency use authorization (EUA) vaccine prevention coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) individuals 16 years age older. emergency use authorization allows Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine distributed means immune system react faster fight virus. vaccine gone body then. antibodies left. glad hear experience necessarily norm. Unfortunately, shopping around gyms easy already contract two. got one, took hundreds dollars giving personal training paid person hired (after ignoring I'd show up) fired quit. Long story short, took money refused apply rest year close account. continued charge years later, sending collections, charging new debit cards never given random amounts (1 dollar make sure new card active multiple times, 70+, three days later another 70+, etc.) Suffice say, want pop another gym gamble enforcing states mask mandate. US is. Pfizer exports start tomorrow  nah really possible much state vaccinated. Unless you’re deny vaccines effective? think frown around here... main reason super careful. I'd take one year pandemic quarantine misery decades chronic health issues. dude care Ok. weird now. [Like non-replicating, that's dendritic cells work anyway.  that's scare articles India using 2 year old footage gas leak show people O2 streets right Depends hospital capacity -- that's reason I'd reintroduce major restrictions. You’re making lot assumptions lot things it’s kind hilarious. don’t go gym haven’t long time it’s much hassle get car drive across town crap easily intense workout right bedroom didn’t go anywhere. free one time fee! 

But doesn’t mean won’t EVER go back. moves stuff I’d like get point work career moment it’s low list things do. 

Got it? Good. leave alone. Covid vaccines approved FDA. Fact check that. immune system need primed? virus exceptionally high survival rate? negative sick couple times entire life. masking disinfecting distancing isolation, may need priming cause immune system likely shot. that's choice make.   comment linking nypost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

yikes Hey! Thanks that. people recognize appreciate willingness. Yeah first Pfizer shot sore arm two days later headache day. second shot mild surprisingly. Sore arm day two later noticed felt little lightheaded tired 3+ mile walk, although fair could didn’t eat enough. 1. stated specifically background R&amp;D applied data analysis statistics. claim everyone works engineering skills.

2. See response #1

3. Fine let's concretely define ""long enough"" - vaccine receives full FDA approval. time period two years frame vaccines either EUA revoked, enough data demographics/ethnic groups conclusion would personally trust could drawn.

4. clarified - please see response #3. Holy shit would suggest things go up, restrictions go June young people won’t get vaccine till September, also increase cases actually expected cases don’t go would mean vaccines work better thought, got lucky, something else happened It’s fine. already unhealthy. Imagine powerful man India today's circumstances yet scared talk causes covid surge lived Idaho half decade. number confederate flags education standards would make think Mississppi  really need get young people fully understand importance getting vaccinated, family, friends, community. get majority young people board we'll even better shape reaching end pandemic. making moral argument people risk necessity get vaccinated, part argument may take hospital beds.

How [a Murica got covered, even last pandemic! Oh wow know vaccines help get rid lingering side effects. get excited hearing new info vaccines do. irony post lost me. 20's 40's. Absolutely. get downvoted time time silly reasons flip side generic posts get tons upvotes. part online. That's fair, I'm struggling see they're blameworthy right. least left media actively denying public health measures still trusting epidemiologists (if words, actions). proving irrelevance L.A.

You correct seeing positive community effort, much wish best. 

Not sure downvoted way- disrespectful response topic. bumped back 1... principle things avoid cognitive dissonance. 

""Principle""? thought severe overreaction covid year now, best thing could ignore it

Great. shared enlightened view frontline healthcare workers? virologists epidemiologists? families 3 million dead thus far? high-risk people potentially exposing think wearing mask getting couple shots overreaction? getting vaccine contrary this. 

Really. possibly ignored pandemic past year unless dead, since affected every aspect society whether personally thought overblown not. much time spend day thinking polio, tetanus, mumps, smallpox, illnesses we've suppressed vaccines? I'm thinking vaccinations exactly *why* completely ignore things. skeptical open back nominal percentage people get vaccinated. worth im liberal

Christ, live Redwood City--a mere block I'm sitting, help me. Shit opening around us...sports, bars, music, social gatherings. Colored tiers disappear June 15th. new rationale skepticism invent then? 

The difference many reopened things need vaccine participate. I'm returning job year's hiatus--vaccine required. Wanna go Giants game? Hear Symphony? Attend college classes? Fly Europe? Vaccine. probably far less cognitive dissonance get one start ignoring pandemic real, claim want to. why? Ted Nugent says it’s hoax bullshit! It’s even cold! go shoot deer you’ll feel fine reaffirm manhood (sorry, chicks pussys, they’re fucked). Don’t worry heart damage lung fibrosis, organ damage , that’s GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY! None shorten life decades! know, anyone knows medicine, it’s Ted!! /s Stupid working class people, right? isn’t new type vaccine. Protein subunit vaccines wide use 30 years (ie vaccine made part virus, described it). received pertussis (TDaP) vaccine western world since 1990, likely vaccine type.

It also mentioned COVID vaccines based idea. Novavax COVID vaccine type, appears highly effective.  2020 could’ve cut slack...but zero learning whole year experience... (1) Car accidents constantly recurring danger going hard cutoff near future safety goes dramatically.

(2) One person getting car accident spread car accidents throughout entire social circle beyond.

(3) People take reasonable measures decrease danger car accidents, wearing seat belt, driving safely, driving drunk, etc.

It's gotcha think is.  Weird country world's worst confirmed death rate Covid desperate reopen. Although maybe weird Orban charge. Important consider voting distribution elderly. oldest people alive generally left leaning elderly. means within elderly demographic, deaths generally presumed within least-red leaning portion them.

I'm sure there's easy breakdown make. som turns 16 next Saturday. Guess “present” be? Vaccine time! 

What relief know he’s almost safe!   You’re likely die car accident covid you’re 50. good news? old people vaccinated young. less old people hospitalized. Oregonian here. one counties that's extreme risk. Businesses shut here? problem. I'll drive 8 minutes freeway, sudden things open. words, stage governor absolute worst zip code Seattle claiming 107% 65+ residents got first shot. Perfectly healthy and/or young people died Covid19 too; presumably, somewhat larger number ventilator.

Yes, much less common us older/less healthy people, zero. Doesn’t help Michigan huge college state general two major university’s rivalry. huge portion population students went spring break last month makes sense numbers up.

I know states lots colleges well. Hell state far biggest college rivalry time Kentucky vs Louisville. UofL didn’t even give students time spring break keep traveling. Whereas schools like Michigan student base go Florida.  Utter nonsense. California sits 31st percent adults vaccinated. key California's 'success' massive surge cases months ago. NYC great covid May/June 2020 too. Germany buying Chinese vaccines. Chinese Fosun invested BioNTech last year rather China receive BioNTech vaccines Germany later also produce themselves.

hahaha...They still ignoring, thank I'll comment go Tuesday many times denied Covid existed said ""99.9% survival rate"" entirely clueless? backed way ""Well 40 year olds getting sick obviously outnumber 80 year olds."" thought hoax, unthinking jackass? see straight whole dishonest conservative partisan hackjob.

I go park run least 10-15 persons one group shit together.

Also, high school students form huge groups shit together, even though classes shifted online!

And nobody anything it, acting slowly!

I bunkered year I'm ready go back normal prolonging suffering frickin reason say second, prompt system ask date received first shot - determine schedule second shot. also CA this, able get second shot different location first. both?


Vaccines everyone! Second dose Pfizer 3 days ago headache day. side effects last least week after, seems. clear since Tuesday man little trippy. odd adjusting back things. eating wife eat somewhere sit patio now. One thing forgotten much better food actually eat restaurant opposed take out. There’s absolutely hope lol Social media inherently evil, but...


Yeah. exacerbated problem ready for. love adamant people arguing Australia ""back normal"" government currently banning citizens returning country. literally nothing normal that.

If want argue worth ""the greater good"", go right ahead. Reasonable people disagree think. please stop saying things normal. disinformation age, certainly. Many countries sorted shit Australia's refused open them. Unless define ""sorted shit out"" ""zero cases"", case are, said, looking years years. turned lot studies re: smoking COVID funded tobacco companies. got minor fatigue muscle/joint soreness day second Pfizer shot. extended family vaccinated, except two holdouts. waiting vaccines approved kids 12 two get vaccine.  live equivalent Deep South San Diego. |: sadly lot people hesitant, several people work don’t plan getting “they don’t trust it.” 

Surprise surprise, deeply conservative religious. (And one also Covid last year figures she’s fine forever now, sigh.)

On plus side, couple people hesitant ended getting got vaxxed didn’t die, lmao. traditional vaccines may able overcome hesitancy feel mRNA viral vectors We’ve better numbers overall stronger reactions. felt like got hit full blown flu 12 hours second dose, misery 48 hours. (Body aches, fever, sweats, chills, nausea, headache, super thirsty, appetite, exhaustion, dizziness.) felt wiped migrainey two days. totally fine. (:

Everyone different. tend feel sick day standard flu vaccines too.

Meanwhile friend got second dose pfizer couple days felt icky hours 100% fine.

My friend got second dose, feels fine today 48 hours misery.

YMMV! India thought woods. 

Sewer samples Corvallis/Albany detected one new strains too. true. can't compare efficacy rates across vaccines. means Anvisa extra safe, considering many countries already approved find anything alarming. Like asking absolute zero worst less 1000 (and less 100 tested batches?) per 10^11 particles replicate is, assume, safe. corrected anything article study, nonsensical claim there's gaslighting. None comments show evidence cases actually caused anxiety. One best friends got Covid. early 40’s, fit af got job firefighter. hospitalized 3 times 6 weeks many, many blood clots. He’s blood thinners year now. trouble walking half mile without resting. still can’t work can’t work he’s blood thinners probably never happen. isn’t old fat people disease. It’s also good it’s less people overall, compared peaks. means young numbers slightly rising, older numbers drastically fallen. Expat, I've lived Guangdong like... entire adult life haha know Russia explanation Turkish Medical Association month (click Translate Tweet) 

There many many examples news past year. Ramps, perfect word. need move stuff. One authors paper addressing concerns raised anti-vax people citing claim mRNA vaccines cause harm: baby still part many pregnancy groups forums. I’ve heard good amount women getting vaccine pregnant doctors recommendation. 

My baby 4 months pediatrician highly suggested get vaccine since studies showing antibodies get passed breast milk well. Yes. Look real world vaccine studies done. effective preventing spread, wide margin. Especially people vaccinated could easily backfire we're making big deal second dose, drives people get weaker vaccine.

8% really low number, though. Hahaha fact tried use population densities prove point discredits it. Canada huge country, small, fairly concentrated pockets population. 90% Canada's population lives within hours drive border USA.

You take smugness shove ass.  Based information? They're far 1M new cases per day already. probably testing capacity curve go much higher. many people look death numbers ignore hospitalisation rates. Young people generally fine till beds oxygen. death rate sores. Plus new strains seem hitting 40s harder. family NHS UK say age victims way lower January. Luckily vaccination programme really well. Bit looking grim poorer countries. Also replied above. agree underreporting. talked people European countries mentioned sick March hoped cold. like: ""What mean hope? never tested?"". No, didn't. lose sense smell taste fever. Testing mostly done hospital places, get lumped sick old people waiting emergency ward. cousin shocked get tested thought he'd infect people. Europe. Imagine rural India anything outside big cities. immune response putting people hospital. calm Mexico City’s elderly, arriving “really scared” vaccination sites, officials cued bands masked wrestlers. Sure enforce since ""vaccine passports"" taboo apparently?

Take antivaxxer's word it? I'm sure none lie. got second dose today, it’s relief finally receive full vaccination. hover ~1m first doses foreseeable future. 

Careful going bar hopping. First, takes weeks vaccine fully take effect. Second, vaccine guarantee get infected. Still good idea social distance wear mask dunno! me. Anything China related gets weird upvote/downvote dynamics Reddit lol. post Worldnews really banal factual statement it’s like live here, get downvoted oblivion. guess people mistook curiosity disbelief?

Being able fly back forth godsend parents he's grateful able it. One risks took flying travel restrictions imposed would stuck. No, don’t many ICU beds left province. Sad face. god India terrifying, there's indication we've hit peak yet think many cases people want government fail, able say “I right”. 

Uninformed people everywhere. hear lot “in Russia everyone wants vaccine vaccine” keeping mind every EU country vaccinated per capita Russia. find hilarious magically hitting certain date officially safe give vaccine. Like 15 years 364 days one day later come get it. Anyway good good him. Thanks hesitant children. Pfizer massive vertically integrated pharma behemoth. Moderna assembly subcontractors moving direction speed. would expect Pfizer significantly larger cost efficiencies. extra $17 rounding error US. it’s gonna go world market sell coin. Yea..... don’t know say health care system back normal we’re dangerously close activating triage protocols.

Triage normal never discussed near other. downvoting me? Angry Chinese? American. police arrests people tweeting criticism government, anyone would scared. even hate speech, proper criticism. actually scary here. Anecdotally, comparable Washington, DC. Especially around methadone clinics. Basically, Feds useless, States cash-strapped.

The latter cannot really levy taxes, allocate funding Feds give (it's obfuscated/complicated IRL, that's crux it).

And Feds given dime run quarantine, really done anything own. difficult, given need federal aid build mid-size intersection, let alone anything complicated.

So states using hotels middle cities, _heap_ measures try make safe possible - airflow checked, every single one thousands workers system tested every single day, etc etc - still leak they're pushed hard.

And India pushing little bit hard. Heck, SA received 14 cases single day, despite everyone needs proof-of-negative depart.

So collectively asked Feds help, Feds said ""we'll ban flights India"".

And that. Show us bad guy touched you... would wear mask getting vaccine? That’s like going back prison sentence over. say you’re free, you’re free wife got knocked J&amp;J vaccine side effects subsided like 36 hours button. Like literally sitting couch stood said ""hey feel fine"".  captain always first ship, oh wait. wake thinking March 2020? Literally one forcing stay inside. Go walk something lmao. ☝🏻In view Governor, advised OHA/OHSU, chose incorrectly hold back vaccine reserves also bump teachers vaccine order. Everyone got pushed back weeks. state consistently lower section vaccine distribution state. we’ve got growing cases. frustrating. Keeping fingers crossed us one dose board help slow thing down. Moderna Pfizer vaccines similar seem safest covid vaccines extremely safe. Incidence side effects less 1 million lower Moderna. side effects, any, appear happen period immune system responding vaccine 7-14 days afterwards.

Once vaccinated chances getting sick virus fall 90% chance illness serious falls even further. Joe Rogan giving medical advice? Anyway get shots people. states already dropped appointments entirely said show up. focus needs shift pushing CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, supermarkets, doctors offices.  course, rest world still exists. Back normal ever refers nightclubs hardly closed parts.

There's still huge complexities - even competent government, managing high quota quarantine arrivals, could point quarantine say ""that aint normal"". what? Huh? listening even variants evade immune system, mainly vaccinated.  Dan Crenshaw fucking shambles. see coming is. guess reddit need ""/s"" explicitly stated anymore (for first bit knob part).

Hope it’s ok repost.

The hysteria social media specific passages Pfizer protocol. Specifically, wording Page 67 Page 68.

I get Page 67 wording. least think do. could use help interpreting wording Page 68.

Bottom Page 67: 
“A female found pregnant exposed exposed study intervention due environmental exposure. examples environmental exposure pregnancy: • female family member healthcare provider reports pregnant exposed study intervention inhalation skin contact.”

So last sentence says environmental exposure occurs woman exposed vaccine inhalation skin contact — like open vial vaccine accidentally spilled.

So Page 67 pretty straightforward.

But top Page 68 says this: 
“A male family member healthcare provider exposed study intervention inhalation skin contact exposes female partner prior around time conception.”

How interpreted? man exposed vaccine accidentally inhalation skin contact, somehow get sperm? would female partner report EDP (Exposure Pregnancy) mate got exposed?

Some anti-vaxxers Twitter getting hysterical this. Page 67 seems easy enough explain, Page 68? considering here? vaccine work it’s way man’s semen? re-infection scientifically impossible prove? I'm tired shit life  Wow. feel her, really do. I've feelings dealing numerous patients phone, clinic, even Reddit. us worked (and continue work) fight pandemic burned out. Done it. Pissed off.

Frustratingly, Health Ministry refuses post variant infected logical guess would Indian strain since gov importing workers almost daily India since last year. 

We 0-2 community cases continuously past months everything peaceful.

We 1.3m+ single dose. Close 900k completed vaccination. frontline staff, essential staff elderly. shots mostly Pfizer Moderna. Here's hoping vaccines remain effective Indian variants. dare call team. Sure, totally.

A live virus neut assay every variant reaches prevalence country 50 million people much easier seems be.

Unfortunately seem always get pseudovirus assays right away seem show worse vaccine efficacy studies done later live virus. people assume worst.

That said, every time we've done mRNA sera, result. vaccines work.

There actually much higher risk end hospital got car 40 years old.

And yes lot infections going on, per capita much belgium, france germany.

So dont understand many young people needs get hospitalized vaccine is, say, 90% effective, means 10% vaccinated still get sick and/or dead. That's obviously great improvement, 10% nobody, they're real people too. there's need people resort fiction find examples fully-vaccinated folk die anyway.

I go Russia get vaccine June I'm seriously considering trip US states offer vaccines (apparently least Alaska wants it). case also personal reasons really want wait September fully immunized, probably consider without those, understand people do. orders yes, many doses actually administered?

Russia made contracts facilities India, China South Korea produce really huge number doses. Also many countries produce smaller doses Sputnik (and production already started). problems capabilities. sure Germans already vaccine Sputnik approved.

Well, lets see. EU still even haven’t received application

That's wrong. Sputnik vaccine rolling review since March, first phase evaluating over. month, EMA members inspect prdouction facilities Russia. chance might get approved soon. left pre-covid.

Haven't home since Christmas 2019. cancel wedding Australia March 2020, Australia closed borders.

Getting back extremely difficult, everyone afford flights quarantine.

Fuck right? Pfizer changing prices nation nation, poorer countries get cheaper India recorded deadliest day coronavirus pandemic yet, 3,689 deaths last 24 hours.

First sentence article. something more. US UK amount people vaccinated. US 664 deaths yesterday. That's 2 per one million - 136 UK's numbers.

The one, let sink in. ""In opening remarks virtual talks Wednesday Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang, Merkel said two nations “speak openly transparently vaccine production.” guess German people received non-EU compliant vaccine get tested. 

I think focus green card apps anyway overstated. I’d say either get approved used short time frame virus still large threat, doesn’t make sense put restrictions vaccinated individuals. virus threat low level, see restrictions ease, like last summer. case Germany, alone Europe - rest sure opening up!

The whole point Quarantine isolate infected, help recovery.

Fuck fuck stranded citizens want get home? LOL! Moderna used viral genome sequence China design vaccine within 2 days becoming available, that's probably true companies well. long US government got directly involved meaningful way vaccine development. (I'm suggesting US government contribute funding distribution that, scientific response already action first possible time, major reason point soon.) like really nasty hangover lasts way long me.

Its important get ahead things trend spiraling control. I'm curious people worried spike proteins attached virus itself. feeling they're wearing masks socially distancing unvaccinated people. time span? far, day, week? I’m right bud.

People developing countries immigrants generally lot first-hand experience dangers infectious diseases. notable exceptions ""vaccine hesitancy"" tends much first world problem. kinda makes sense though, right? people 80 aren’t going stupid stuff like people 40. left borders safety. Deal it.

The government treating citizens nicely, letting idiots left want back reality struck them. would disgusting political move.

I mean, fine approve Sputnik given European population safety cannot guaranteed. think scientist whatsoever doubt creates immune response fights virus. reason allow vaccinated Russian, Chinese, etc. people travel EU reasonably free. Plus, would shoot foot tourism. think maybe goes bed early it? Didn’t take rocket scientist figure out. 😂 😂 high priority, left safety borders pandemic knew rest Australias citizens owe fuck all. overtrained?

While it’s quite true percentage old people admitted dropping due vaccines (yay!) also true younger people getting hit worse. think quite worrisome letting virus run rampant long means mutating deadly people want live state prevents travelling want? Seriously? drink like bleach? /s What? Prioritised what? Horrific misogyny* runs South Asian East Asian cultures, plenty ""anti-education attitudes"" ground countries well, particularly among poor rural areas. 

*You citing divorce ""illegitimacy"" (seriously?) evils suggests struggle well. ‘Accused’ neccessary here; NYT already confirmed underreporting death counts wouldnt American wasnt called strike team. Hmm point easy get vaccine day appointments. Hopefully gets people putting vaccine sheer inconvenience think main question many countries across world. almost every country react late pandemic, thereby losing chance break chain transmission?

If guess, mix institutionalized racism (those dirty chinese), western exceptionalism (won't happen here) political delusion.

I remember well respected news outlets almost cheering prospect millions chinese deaths inevitable fall chinese government. time reassuring us happen democratic best health care. much one might want talk Chinese suppressing early info virus, put entire province 60 million people hard lockdown Jan 23, varying degrees softer lockdowns entire rest country, essentially self-destructing economy first quarter 2020, response rest world shrug carry before?

I hope hard questions one day, hold breath. likely blame China Trump, western leaders barely better. 

Sure, Chinese completely transparent provided key information raised alarms. nCoV related SARS. enough closed Wuhan. leader able read that, imbeciles, evil both. remember chinese epidemiologist estimating 100 thousands infected time detecting tiny fraction Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 people claim violates rights. fucking stupid. happily wear seatbelts bit cloth much. They're selfish morons mostly. Yeah likely totally fine, seeing one tell first test truly false positive (nor PCR test false negative), course best cautious want chance spreading something. middle ground could taking second PCR test (if US order one pixel.labcorp.com free result 3ish days). chance two false negative PCR tests row much much lower chance one false negative.  Interesting stuff. understand correctly, looks like pushing stories 'heroic acts' (maybe people holding virtual family gatherings? healthcare workers trying best) might effective neutralizer negative stories prevent media consumption-related PTSD? reference, United States.

How much longer foresee wearing masks public? Many city state governments mask mandates expire soon, many already expired. Private businesses however part still mask requirements—which obviously right private business social liability reasons. realize isn’t easy answer question naturally, wearing mask easiest method stopping COVID transmission going last thing go, guys think? end? Masking public feels (at least right now) like it’s going norm foreseeable future least am. state 30 percent full vaxxed. logic extended pandemic year now. uncivil comment, thank you. Hahah, that’s one! xD Yes exactly meant. think worst-case scenario first world countries done end 2021. New record 7 day average deaths new cases suggests next days likely even worse terms deaths. Hopefully vaccines India well oxygen PPE prevent total collapse healthcare system. lot countries without compromising ability fight Covid rest world needs step up. Covid global issue happening India endanger many people outside India well. totally ok do. Walgreens, CVS, Walmart make easy specify scheduling second dose. commenter mentioned, please sure cancel original appointment someone else :)

Bring vaccination card second appointment verify already gotten first shot, end two cards! can't afford phone club probably expensive anyway.    brand anti-vaxxers terrorists now? mean, human history pretty full sort thing.

He's politician think. negative PCR means negative regardless vaccination status. course 100% accurate, think 95%, close get trusted. real side effects I've gotten sore arm. extremely fatigued sleepy sure vaccine sleep deprived. 2 weeks 2nd dose Friday night, slept 16 hours. Safe say sleep deprived side effect vaccine. Whatever effect negligible compared pneumonia antibiotics 2 weeks, caught flu 4 weeks 2006, etc. penicillin shot pain covid vaccine. 

Tldr; I've worse experience compared side effects (including sore arm) may gotten covid vaccine. Terrorist basically Lmao people crazy shit like happenda dog lovers blowing fireworks wharehouse overwhelming evidence vast majority cases either mild even symptomatic all. would describe something small annoyance?

You distorting facts much accuse doing. completely share sentiment! going produce enough variants may drag entire world back lock downs.

Sending tiny amount oxygen, equipment, vaccine jack.

Something needs happen India immediately, country wide, keep things control.  even 12 years ago (where certain SIV pandemic) would despair fact we've destroyed many peoples futures virus 99% survival recovery rate 70.

Dunno - data Joe Bloggs vaccinated, would much harm leaked? basically, vaccinated person, negative PCR good indication actually negative? 

I’ll wait guidance health department, really curious point. logic bad. *KNEW* everyone planning kill you? rational choice kill many people can! 

We need work within realm reality here. :( need vulnerable vaccinated. 

That's done. therefore lockdowns lifted, correct? guess that's criteria, it? US citizen, comforts know raving idiots do, fact, exist outside USA. Can't believe amount people I'm seeing saying they're still going wear mask long pandemic over, possibly even rest lives, ""been nice worry getting sick"" ""like people able see faces.""

how many people still keep masks 6 months they're ones wearing walking street bar? lol none way around: police institutionally rotten good apples best. Zero COVID 100% feasible first world country. Get fuck quitter talk. vaccine good MMR Polio vaccine. thing standing us zero COVID fucks claiming can’t done pushing antivax bullshit.  Thanks! Well, I'll agree article frames poorly. fact young people hospital old people obviously due vaccine really say anything. still think value pointing young people getting hospitalized dying, really contextualize better.

Like, hey, comparing last Dec Apr Michigan, young people +60% cases +175% deaths (so cases getting lethal) sounds scary, cases lethal begin with. That's like, 70 deaths instead 25 deaths. tens thousands cases.

Meanwhile, old people deaths dropped -75% instead thousands dying, hundred dying (they still die way young people). ~1800 old people saved vax, 50 extra young people lost. That's pretty decent overall.

But still, worth pointing people 20s 30s, odds dying catch covid seem jumped 1 2,000 something like 1 900. Still sounds pretty low, that's ignoring odds unknown lasting effects, trip hospital, odds *dying*. odds getting worse. virus prevalent amongst young contagious ever.

It needs said although young people small part overall death number, old people really need told take seriously get shot, already do. good allow virus propagate lot even killing many people, that's get variants. easy get shot take chance (or foist chance anyone else) yet still people wanna it... U.S. paid vaccines well advance via taxes. Every country option governments didn’t. India major drug producer literal manufacturing facilities drug development, still fucked up. Plus sending surplus vaccines countries. We’re hoarding anything. 🙄  amazing ignorant people [issues settled hundred years liberty secured Constitution United States import absolute right person times, circumstances, wholly freed restraint, element liberty one person, minority persons residing community enjoying benefits local government, power dominate majority supported action authority within police power State enact compulsory vaccination law, legislature, courts, determine

I suppose yes, ""choice"" sense pay fine and/or go jail. agree one forced inject anything, mean rights cannot severely restricted (e.g. jail) failure comply. Ok well I’m talking going back normal - concerts, travel, packed restaurants. Mandate vaccine, knock nonsense. there’s crazies world. time sub made seem America crazies. 101 million Americans patriotic duty defend nation enemy attacked us.  fuck wrong people saying living parents 50 normal occurrence Italy!
   
People 50 living parents either disabled took massive financial tumble sell house something. Won’t happen, I’ll object right alongside you. then, steady on. think actually want leave Washington join Idaho. know there's bill something though. actual death numbers far more. know people hang vaccinated, know anyone else ones around long times Negative. Canadian government's responsibility prioritize health Canadians. way possibly justified claiming Indian outbreak threat Canada, stretch, still somewhat reasonable. evidence conspiracy fuelled violence. negation reality crisis times.  Cool. You’re still probably putting undo risk would 2-3 months whatever, vaccines magic, party. guess paying attention mutations popped then. Maybe funded vaccine development? agree need get many people vaccine possible thing said country west can't forcibly inject chemicals someone's body without consent year ago lamenting took four years bring mumps vaccine, thinking royally effed...now i'm two days second shot two weeks seeing parents again! wrong Gonna problem thousands antimaskers running around creating super spreader events. want people designing vaccine passport consider issues create solution disproportionately affect poor people negatively.

Like said, favour vaccine passports such, feel still problematic may present major issues access public spaces. 1. Americans tend vacation US anyway, US big awesome there's tons stuff see.
2. Plenty countries open vaccinated. Expect Caribbean open. I'm personally planning going Iceland. And, hey, encourages people get vaccinated, better. You’re responding post cites CDC explicitly says it’s fine you’re still sowing dissent. don’t get it. even live here? everyone talking asses comes Italy? People take loans country buy houses happens time. fact italians [above americans] ot comes net wealth. People prefer buy instead rent houses. Exactly horrific figures yesterday equal around 900 deaths US 200 UK. countries reached levels, deemed successful 'doing well', fact US posted figures like earlier week. descriptions getting suggest figures coming out. suggest worse UK, said would around 33k per day January rate. However situation sounds far worse, would guess using real figure least 10x saying. figures numbers, reflecting true situation. say BBC reported 50k day dying India, might make people take bit notice.

Only find many excess deaths clue real death toll is. I'm scared find answer. 😥 Yes covid going anywhere either. faster come conclusion better be. Zero covid feasible ""Oh, hello Perry Platypus, pleasant surprise? ask? Ah yes, Vaccine-in-ator, inject citizens mRNA proteins, allowing ~~take over~~ save TRI STATE AREA"" Inb4 ""JuSt Tw0 m0rE W33kz!"" bet reported number gonna get higher 6k Amazing, simply expressed nervous people decide downvote reply snide instead trying reassure. going daily announcement foreseeable future not. course can. question whether worth bother. 

You could hard stick (fines jailtime refusal), soft stick (refusing services / creating restrictions non-vaccinated individuals), carrot (a big stimulus check contingent vaccination status). fact childhood vaccination rates states 99%+ shows mandates work. 

For disease like COVID-19, probably meaningfully mandate vaccination forms. couple months virtually deaths COVID would completely prevented counterfactual future mandatory vaccinations, reach ""societally acceptable"" level death voluntary vaccinations people accept political implications aggressive vaccination efforts. 

For disease like smallpox (or alternatively SARS/MERS-level IFR virus contagious SARS-CoV-2), would absolutely make sense mandate vaccination. advocate approach, many states went far night-time no-knock raids gunpoint force smallpox vaccinations people early 1900s. better ways accomplish outcome, effective.  best news seeing decline 44 percent population vaccinated least one dose, one-third fully vaccinated. learn code finding short term unskilled labor get different.

OP autism Actually asking friend. looking like first shot August since that's they're expecting 16-24 get theirs. second sometime September. There's chance getting J&amp;J since that's restricted 50s here. already flights booked, probably best decision. Ontario enters chat that’s think messaging covid shitty. tell people isolate stay away, mask company others thing entirely done, you’re asking impossible task average person. change message “if lower risk groups feel comfortable putting people household risk covid, go it. plan see elderly/high risk family friends, refrain contact outside household follow precautions.” gives people bit control lives. 

If try suppress idea majority people recover without complications aren’t honest. can’t make people care people, decide themselves. masking, vaccine, distancing vein. person isn’t likely one they’re probably unlikely three. Currently lying couch 3 blankets 76 degree room day second Pfizer dose feeling like mother hangovers even though slept 8.5 hours last night. Good you.

Unfortunately others - (Peru) not. whatever reason it’s basically non-existent Texas. Completely open hundred cases per day now. People still wearing masks I’m Dallas though.


There many different factors think it’s hard blame outbreak one specific thing. question: 

I regularly donate blood Florida. received notification positive Covid19 Antibodies. first vaccine 2 days donating blood. never symptoms Covid - mean vaccine gave antibodies, likely exposed a-symptomatic? Thank help! pretty much every TV station, newspaper magazine business fear porn. matter they're completely misrepresenting situation. Whatever sensational run. past year made fucking disillusioned media. nearly trash thought already 2 months back. depends vaccination site. city live, there's one site foreigners go to, gave Sinovac. seems commonly offered vaccine.

I'm sure someone really wanted, could digging find place offers Sinopharm vaccine. though, looked real world data Chile (67% effective symptomatic, 85% effective hospitalization death), figured that's probably fine 34 year old without comorbidities. Brazilian variant becomes dominant strain worldwide, figure I'd probably need sort booster future, I'm also ok with. mean nursing home. drove 6 hours visit laws spent day bed. getting 50 percent figure? I’m assuming confirmed cases? Unfortunately, there’s significant overlap anxiety symptoms severe allergic reaction. much reading potential side effects first dose. I’m furthest thing antivax, year’s shit, sat wait, started feel like trouble breathing. Hands tingly. hives, figured anxiety pretty quickly. It’s rational. know it’s one million chance order magnitude safer drive there, stupid monkey brain still panics. It’s people necessarily ignorant anything except beginning panic attack feels like, nip shit bud.

&amp;#x200B;

 headache, soreness, fatigue two days first dose, that’s common. second Pfizer yesterday symptoms all. hospitalizations recover? I’m guessing yes never saw much numbers this. It’s crazy even chance hospitalization people still wrote shit off. Like fuck wants hospital top potential risks? voiced concern vaccine effective (I didn’t know yet). got berated selfish, making myself, got DM calling racist. Reddit wild really matter? However small number it’s significantly bigger potential risk vaccine.


It’s small number *can* happen, wouldn’t vaccinated. here, chills bad chipped tooth! county, we're currently 70% least one dose 1/2 fully vaccinated.

At least 50% age groups gotten least one shot.

I expect continue. We'll hit 80% easy. least one city that's hit 90% others closing in.

Proud fuck Contra Costa County.

The cities 50% rural areas voted certain way. affect nerves, attacks regeneration mechanism smell receptor cells. least that's looks like, fully confirmed.

More details: n=1 anecdotes like actually tell us anything all. one study found real quick mentions risks indoor dining:  60? 70? got first Moderna shot Jan. chance second shot yet. full blown Covid Mar 2019, felt like gonna die bad, mostly difficulty breathing. didn’t want anyone know condition (I live health ins). 

I’m dental hygienist. I’ve felt sick past 3 weeks. Fatigue, difficulty breathing, insomnia, nausea (actually threw yesterday). first simply chalked Covid long haul symptoms I’ve fatigue symptoms since Nov 2019. think might one new strains.

If fact new strain think it’s really bad news folks US. It’s like getting Covid never seems go away, even rest. Case loads could really spike cause don’t think vaccine effective it. least hasn’t helped much. I’m Chinese makes difference. think one thing we've learned reacting fast, rather waiting overwhelmed, makes big difference. didn’t get side effects second dose. anything wrong that? I’m 18 healthy.

Conclusion? talk winter surge, California pretty decent job. half population live C.D.C. classifies “highly-vulnerable” counties, compared quarter Floridians; pandemic should’ve done bigger number them. can’t say whether California enough, relatively aggressive campaign equity vaccine distribution surely pay dividends state looks end pandemic.

And, ideal world, wouldn’t much inequity vulnerability first place. hope that, emerge, leaders see we’re strong weakest link; take lessons we’ve learned mess, enact policies may lead positive change. stop following cases Covid first time look back cases. Like stop caring old news stuff. thinking ""Give information world returns back normal"" US, generally care profit generated spending actual benefit. China's giving lot incentives people get vaccine now, like free ice cream coupons (like, pages them) nearby participating restaurants. pretty great.  Swine flu.

Obviously India needs help right now, understand they're main country everyone helping right many places worse. Well, we've voted thank God. I'm actually surprised enough brains that. evidence indicates deactivated virus vaccines prevent death. Efficacy calculated symptomatic classes. mild sickness acceptable scenario.

Really isn’t answer outside vaccine, there?   Also, extremely naive think coronavirus vaccine research, happening decade, done US.

Imagine condescending call people naive dropped “The Roman Empire lasted decade” logical falsehoods. Coronavirus’ known researched century research vaccines SARS go back 2003 initial outbreak. 

Of 3 vaccines EUA US, 85% vaccines purchased developed explicitly proprietary technology developed US Moderna licensed BioNTech (then funded American bio pharmaceutical company Pfizer). fundamentals stabilizing mRNA vaccine deploying globe would happened without American bio pharmaceuticals full stop. 

Not mention mRNA vaccines approved emergency use US cannot deployed without cold chain infrastructure developing world doesn’t have. US sending doses countries hundreds millions approved emergency use FDA don’t give “the US selfish prolonging pandemic” bullshit. 

Americans going get vaccinated 7 months everyone else contributed anyone else development vaccines currently approved use US paid development deployment. would slap face American tax payers funded titanic effort didn’t give chance protected first. sucks. still enjoy eating? worry downvotes. ask genuine question people downvote you, shows you. life far bigger issues worry downvoted Reddit.  there’s way people 40 people 80.

Would like see person 3rd phase trial effects longer interval gap myself, possible 12 week gap improves overall efficacy much like AZ vaccine. Whenever someone mentions vaccine hesitancy mention states highest rate vaccine hesitancy also consistently rank lowest education. Canada tried China never sent vaccine testing provided technology needed.

If China wants cooperation, it’s need cooperate. Vaccinations globally start picking month. US finally reached point supply outstripped demand start exporting doses manufactured US Monday.

Unfortunately, push narrative opposition restrictions makes one tin-foil-hat-5G-microchip-enthusiast. Even protesting something reasonable - destruction working class businesses, example. 

My advice would stand firm views, let angry mob intimidate submission. Also, remain peaceful protest. impression said people young 21 prioritized vaccine, save vaccine people need it. sound unreasonable  unlikely. lot experts saying outbreak exceptionally bad population immunity like parts country. remember California struggling, hopefully everyone significant natural immunity+vaccination keep spread bay. obviously, news Even flu last year covid rise, lungs still aren’t year fact. 

Being laid didn’t help, able force body could four five years ago is…frustrating.  protest pandemic control measures, want block access vaccines help end pandemic control measures?

 Careful, Canada, that’s American logic you’re stumbling into. Oh don’t doubt especially dumbasses avoid getting vaccinated. Vaccination rates dropping off.  CVS site specifically allows schedule second dose, tell vaccine got 1st dose when. Super simple, lying. That’s whole story. 

The governor refused work legislature instead decided go rouge act outside lawful authority. especially silly since legislature passed series bills would kept emergency orders place...the governor refused sign instead continued defy laws state. 

It worked it’s way courts Supreme Court ruled appropriately governor attempting exercise authority didn’t have.  

Not worry, governor department health human services institute restrictions. 

Michigan continued one COVID restricted states still today. Kids need go school old people need go play cribbage Completely disagree uncle really fat. family got sick, one hospitalized. fully recovered, since gets tired standing up. Well still masks really normal Vaccination passports key normalizing live. Gyms, dorms, stadiums, planes etc. used safely those. Well even fully reopen, lot big tourist attractions like Disneyland allowing California residents. hopefully dissuades never understood need physical passport already inject tracker get vaccine. **The government plans** evaluate restrictions May 15. Eastern Europe part EU Balkans probably get donated us.  CDC stated site theyre still learning well vaccines prevent spreading virus, sounds like enough evidence guarantee can't spread even vaccinated, spreading misinformation, I'm still going cautious get vaccine CDC knows certain. Source: ""what still learning"" section also know doctor seeing ""tons"" actual vaccine reactions (and so, hope he's reporting it) he's seeing ""tons"" people coming complaining think vaccine reactions turn nothing. I'm inclined believe latter. 17 - Spotlight: Emergency Measures

 International human rights law permits, emergency threatens life nation, certain rights derogated. emergency must officially proclaimed, measures must: 

• taken extent strictly required exigencies situation; 

• inconsistent obligations international law; 

• time-limited; 

• discriminate. derogation permitted certain specified rights, including right life. 

Other States formally declared state emergency adopted emergency measures combat virus. measures impact human rights, must discriminate, provided law necessary proportionate meet public health crisis. 

So unless i'm reading incorrectly please correct wrong, United Nations mention extreme cases threat life nation play measures restrict movement allowed long permenant i.e. lasting pandemic branches anything futher passed etc. Australia banning people entering country India due extremeely dangerous variant pandemic acceptable real threat danger lives Australia's inhabitants. things considered, things alright could much better. vaccine helping, tons people seem want take good reason, something political conspiracy theory. 

I heartbroken situation India, rest assured rest world going help can! human together. Earlier like January/December fully understood unlikely ""true asymptomatic"" spread compared exceedingly common ""pre-symptomatic"" spread. Haha. disagree logic comment? India thought endgame covid too. changed fast.  Glad family made it. Hopefully full recovery. 

One important things test positive Covid19 get oximeter ($20) chart oxygen saturation levels. falls 95 trending downwards, get hospital. feel low, lack oxygen damage body organs.

I lost 2 family members virus, seen damage another family member (Hopefully full recovery).

I niece lost best friend it. Pregnant too. took baby c-section 4 days mother died. mother vent, died never seeing getting hold child. 26 years old. 

I wish people would cavalier. Michigan’s governor mandated strictest COVID rules country year now....apparently approach using “only best science” isn’t working.  

Also, trip Florida spring break telling others same, lying it, likely big factor undoing. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It’s rare didn’t CA Nope, 1 available. Last one could qualify thanks! people getting free vaccine already? Amazing read quote thought talking yourself. duality we’re living in. Like two sides mirror. Brazil instance nearly 5x death rate right India does.

India isnt properly reporting deaths 1. India massively underreporting cases deaths. Possibly magnitude 6-30 times. Right now, country hit hardest pandemic, even close contest.
2. medical systems South America Eastern Europe struggling cope influx patients, experienced absolute collapse India's medical system going right now. People literally dying streets front Indian hospitals, waiting care never come.

So summary, no, fact place hit hardest pandemic right now. better immunocompromised? dont think virus stopped section population cannot/will needful(like masking/social distancing). things failed big time preparation. seen oxygen crisis vaccine supply good enough. dont know India exported 60 million doses could slowed spread seen. Plus India approved vaccines faster looked local manufacturing well. things painful next months vaccine supply kind herd immunity gets built. going come great cost. many tragic stories heart breaking :-( Oh man. 

Any news 16 since don’t vaccine yet? supposed wait 7 days, that's symptoms. think atleast 10 symptoms 3 days disappear. heart goes South Asians right now.

Thanks. plan continue follow absolutely asinine idea going back soon. Like god, it’s 4 days. shitty situation, dude. sucks people little empathy. even critical thinking.  ""We need unity! ... Oh no.. like this""

Same Australia, small groups people right wing hippies grouping together protests. 
Though pretty good here, people understand cases control border Netherlands Germany sometimes streets middle cities villages. Impossible enforce 100% unless build wall something. sounds like good news, right? would expect considering older populations higher mrna therapy rates now. She’s like 21 year old kindergartener. ways one. Day shot totally fine 11a, chills good eight hours. headache, nothing else except chills. Went bed early. Woke feeling fantastic.

Also, fellow Michigander replies talking MI! Supposedly University Michigan medical helicopter crew t-shirts saying, “We’re best part worst day life.” 
It don’t matter you’re going through; helicopters cool. Bruh even post title UK must something different since cases deaths far US per capita. nations almost identical overall vaccinations cases. eagles club? start feeling better pretty soon, probably around 48 hours symptoms started ~2.5 days vaccination sooner.

Try get plenty fluids consider taking NSAID pain relievers need . wondering thing except fruit instead large flightless birds anxiety fled second got shot. woke middle night unbelievable arm pain. sure vaccine got I've seen Pfizer data showing undectable anti-spike neutralizing antibodies day 7 post first-dose. day 2 would definitely suspect asymptomatic infection.  Whoa whoa wait second. California actually patting back it’s handled pandemic? 😂😂😂 Mate, heart goes people
of India.

Sure things could worse, Taiwanese taken covid seriously start. many ways leading world. Life remained mostly untouched covid. Taiwan banned citizens traveling freely.

I agree quarantine vaccination necessity travel post covid world. disappointing poorly Aus gvt treated citizens, outside borders welcome priority. Yes, many cases immunization (flu ebola) longer wait time shots leads better immunity outcomes - see AstraZeneca - second shot immunity rises first delayed  would arent many diseases consistently maim people horribly without killing significant number them. Death easy measurement take. Day-by-day energy levels lot harder quantify. went chose public transportation handle right rush hour. Need test vaccines! 44 good health, would able get vaccine city months still would need living hot zone, fat pre-existing conditions get shot younger age. 

You're eligible AZ. Also everyone 18+ eligible May 24. ... read article, you? probably read commenting. think completely consistent. believe scientists politicians mask-wearing social distancing, believe scientists politicians vaccines.

I 100% fine people getting wish getting immunity hard way. Ngl, Michigander, I'm seeing virus hurt friends family, saying me. bad still see masks off, busy stores restaurants, crazy parents kids, sports going full speed, people still talking like big deal. sad. really sucks unless somewhere like job school could report to, really much do. imagine fair amount covid spread way people simple don’t care suck. You’re narc wanting though. think concern India lot people positive tests results arrival. problem test accuracy fake certificates, etc. coming India. think you’re letting random opinions internet get much. Stop caring people disagree start caring real action real issues.  There's evidence long disease-acquired immunity lasts robust is, particularly people get mild cases. honestly, got once, idea would risk getting again. Excellent!!!

I got second Pfizer shot Wednesday mildly sore arm. one wants this

From governor’s restrictions source great consternation pushback struggling businesses weary residents. also received support accepting grim forecasts eager pandemic end. This. bit mulling whether scientists study large flightless birds whether *were* birds studied science.

Maybe browse interwebz late night haha 🙃 Think greater good rest country. minimal covid impact due super strict rules. Yep love agree wholeheartedly. silver lining tragic pandemic wearing masks, using hand sanitizer nonstop, staying away people become normalized. fucking love old people? “Flew London... Britain banned travelers India eight days ago.” they're objectively wrong. like people ""dangers"" vaccines, Covid ""the flu"" climate change ""a hoax."" Left unchecked, beliefs serious real world consequences. hometown Michigan thank ""Romeo Rambler"" this. literal Patriot Mascot Facebook small town spell. spew much bigotry, brag Proud Boy connections, Trump like Jesus, real passion spreading false information vaccine. kid not: infiltrated Macomb County ""you'll die vaccine"" gossip faulty news links. 

Anyone want read utter bullshit, feel free look report page. Thank you! appreciate it! true think also qualify recognizing something like 60% cases asymptomatic really dont know contagious asymptomatic people especially they're physical distancing. Covid 19 extremely high survival rate JHINA BAAAAAAAD! want compare hospitalizations car crashes hospitalizations covid stats available actually makes point even better deaths comparison Thanks! rna works wife take day work couple years ago flu shot. side effects aren’t alarming way. talked like 3 people LA last week waiting time pass getting weren’t going get already COVID. think Bay Area better, theres definitely lot people skeptical. Interesting many different vaccines developed year. assumption many would fail doesn’t seem case. Yup me.

Had vasovagal syncope 10 minutes first Pfizer dose. psychologically emotionally fucked ever since. Second dose next Saturday. looking forward it.

Definitely won’t boosters that’s thing. Apparently it’ll weeks months emotions stabilize. work great now. people get infected, moral virus mutate, time goes antibodies cell memories less effective dude makes sad politicized.

If believe hoax big deal, precautions vaccines unnecessary. hope I’m expert. many studies done last year half figure what’s happening. 

Last 1918 pandemic germ theory wasn’t even thing modern medicine infancy. many tools, captured much data, sequenced virus virus variants, living gold mine public health virology. Vaccines introduce immune system protein synthesis covid-19. helps healthy people recover quicker rely immune system work without vaccine. helps immune system fight virus without making sick. science. trust scientists body getting infected armor. cdc themselves: ""view"", click ""people"" instead ""total doses"". click ""population 18"". easy comparison, theres data table near bottom page expand sort states stat. that, california currently 62.3% adults least 1 dose even question, there’s reason designed 2 doses “complete immunization” Humans tend bad risk assessment statistics. consider many people afraid sharks, afraid stuff that's way, way likely kill them, like driving.

Many people also learn enough things like mRNA, protein replication, immune system, etc. good general understanding new vaccines work. understandable skeptical things understand. insist old infirm prioritized?  get vaccine? Yes rubbish old they? Covid 19 extremely high survival rate  country likes wall building, failed see correlation. /s They're probably far behind immunity people virus areas  J&amp;J already proven work South African variant similar one. I'm sorry  honestly lucky felt minor headache night  seem super observant distancing measures parts? lot large maskless congregations flexing freedom bars restaurants? see might keep infections low steady. eoyld rsther caccines go old prople impoverished countries young people U.S. US country world exists, worry

What knob also basically nothing extreme. sore arm definitely harsh second dose, mildly tired next night. also felt little warmer usual every time checked temp never higher 98.4. got Moderna, whole family got Pfizer similar experience could worse... least stranded India.  got 2nd Pfizer shot Wednesday, reaction sore arm, yes, sore 1st shot.

I taken day off, ended going in.

My friend got 2nd Moderna shot Thursday told Friday tell family loves them. still dragging bit today (Saturday), longer feeling near death. must part gorilla 39 Albertan here...can confirm handling terribly statistocally invulnerable. Source 61.5%? can’t find anywhere would jazzed see official capacity Yeah also believe natural immunity quite good evidence I've seen despite news saying. perfect pretty robust strong long-lasting. might also lot year's worth evidence thr risk covid people nil. I'll meet Valhalla friend. Australia many apartments. Welding shut apartments pretty isolated incidents, Australia police cover exits selected buildings. peak cases Australia ~700, really need dedicated isolation facility. someone hasn’t seen movie getting Thursday, dumb me? (Pun intended) got second shot Monday almost symptoms kinda cool! necessarily true. certainly resistant people appears much less states certainly good would need mask? It’s like flu!!! Less .99% people die!!! Open bars, tired drinking trailer home!!! /s  mild case COVID December. honestly, wasn’t even top ten “sickest I’ve ever been.” top two diseases never want get (adult chickenpox other), it’s number 1 spot illnesses wish I’d never gotten first place - primarily don’t know long-term effects COVID are. yet intention reopen herd immunity achieved. Like rats fucking cage. think people disservice people lumping everyone doubts vaccine, rushed dangerous current pandemic was, group people give kids bleach enimas better dead autistic.

I personally leery J&amp;J particular, track record selling products nasty long term consequences. reason doubt Pfizer Moderna, glad got first shot (even made feel like utter shit, hey go figure; half million people year dying thing, side effects suddenly become acceptable) histories companies absolutely cavalier people's lives. Denying fact rather meeting reality taking miniscule risk negate significant one, dishonest. nurse LA gave wife 2nd Pfizer last week vaccinated. People skeptical. looks like they’re testing another anti microbial coating finding works Covid. Even it’s useless Covid, still prevent transmission disease. Yes, would good coating face masks. Alright. You’re troll get it. go away. Enjoy sitting fat ass. One limb time I'm scheduled get first shot Moderna one I'm still nervous trying get consistent information, primarily regarding potential ""long term"" side effects well people getting covid getting shot. knowledge research using mRNA vaccinations conducted since roughly 2004 main reason mRNA actually safer traditional vaccine method. mRNA method excludes risks come injecting someone supposed inert virus, namely, risk virus actually cause disease person vaccinated. long term effects significantly less likely completely impossible since mRNA causes production dummy spike proteins degraded flushed system within hours injection, thus meaning can’t anything else since it’s gone. That’s researchers aren’t concerned side effects surfacing beyond 6 weeks maximum since everything vaccine body then. far getting Covid getting shot concerned, see people say tons people happening place I've found nothing actually detailing information since pieces. anyone stuff confirm correct info I'm looking here? friend lost sense taste smell due regular flu virus, covid-19 thing. took three years started notice coming back. He's pretty much back normal now; took really long time. 

Usually, would say rely anecdotes, absence information, here's one data point suggests might permanent?

Good luck. Prob pay folks honestly. Republicans love money neighbors. It’s hard tell many people getting second dose elsewhere, though. people drove pretty far first shots, would tempting get second dose somewhere convenient even messed metrics. Cool man, good shape though, yeah proved point returning gym like gym, covid

you used COVID reason. admit didnt like it. hard?

I know shape 1 bragging tiny milage, two making excuses lying.

being able 5 pullups better planet, good US sequences (checks variant) 1% positive cases closely tracked. ... learned that. would bet probably already knew regard pandemics.

It's generous say ""we."" family owns Serum Institute India. No, vaccinations kept persons private confidential medical records, made known given consent way court order. anyone's business whether vaccinated not. exemptions allow people refuse masks well vaccinations discriminated compliance man made rules [not laws] good argument made defense inside court. want protected virus understandable cant go discriminating person's protected rights. cant cake eat without legal problems. dont believe laws stating anyone must comply mask vaccination, good reason. Young people personal benefit getting vaccine Oh come on... would that?

I even consider that. actually need virus spike protein cause damage....

I going optimist though. starting look like vaccines actually prevent high percentage that... even exposed vaccinated much avenue significant accumulation spike proteins... right? article 2 months old… Next thing telling blood clots side effects head. can’t blame corporations obesity. people aren’t obese. corporations blame, we’d obese regardless careful parents were. risk really never going get lower dude.

After vaxxed risk dying COVID less eating fucking steak choking 

get grip We're well UK strain dominant strain months now. mix strict lockdown vaccine brought numbers lowest since last summer. 

There's nothing data suggest UK variant resistant current vaccines. charge case. job never given someone like would say America well enough people able think still ""no big deal."" 

So, good bad thing. vaccines pretty widely available almost anyone wants get shot, least part world demand starting slow some. (See note.) feel fortunate shots already.  Dude going live rest life avoiding things tiny risk COVID? 

Jesus fucking Christ US Europe tracking cases pretty accurately. deaths long patient confirmed covid. there's definitely excess deaths caused pandemic necessarily directly due covid it'll probably years everything settles someone looks analyzes data we'll know total death count pandemic. Well government taking thing seriously large part blame currently happening. Pfffft one Joe Rogan at? different alex jones. dangerous think discriminate it’s privilege compared right. eg flying airplanes attending university. People wish things, complying various burdens, like showing photo ID, compliant cabin, carrying weapons, and, yes, vaccinated. You’re way risk driving going gym 2021 dude weren’t really going bud, hey petty excuse shape went MIL appointment didn’t even feel needle go in. Didn’t get chance panic over.

Would highly recommend accompanying someone possible. panicked car, forgot undo seatbelt.... Tin Foil Hat time: Russia wants die. susceptible Russia’s disinfo campaign. Makes perfect sense me. Definitely Republicans. Yep! That’s source. Axios reported yeah, it’s terrifying. I’ve said forever death thing worry covid. I’m 33 second shot Pfizer breeze. Brain fog slowness next day otherwise got easy. exactly problem COVID scare

Fat losers sitting inside, trying make everyone else same

The tyranny weak, it’s pathetic That’s petty sad dude.

Cool know live head rent free gym open since July, none us wear masks county hasn’t traced single case back us

Gyms often better ventilation facilities  We've seen cases college athletes 7 year old die top head NC. Yep, standing watching rest country drop Washington state. Exciting frustrating time. seem leveled hope start dropping soon. it’s not. it’s almost like COVID actually affect younger adults, need vaccinated all.. I'd get jabbed ice cream steak dinners doesn’t even transmit surfaces got second dose today, it’s relief finally receive full vaccination.

I'm bit relaxed social distancing I've vaccinated. like space person front behind recent days, six feet rules aggressively enforced like back early 2020. found standing line like normally would pre-Covid.

Some people even wandering around without masks they're entering stores clerks giving hard time anymore.

If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus&amp;subject=Removed submission&amp;message=I'm writing following submission:  got anything slightly sore arm little low energy (but fatigue level, like first shot) 36 hours post-2nd dose Three days post 2nd Pfizer dose... still side effects except mild soreness injection site day after. husband also side effects. I've heard that, super hit-or-miss. Probably depends exactly what's causing long-term symptoms. made go away, others actually caused get worse. Still worth try though, nothing else I'd bet reinfection someone suffering long-term symptoms would even worse flare-up.  Canada starting rill southeast states first doses. surprised Canada passes likes Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee next weeks. anti-vaxxers. growing number ones think COVID-19 hoax vaccines cause autism/have 5G nanites 16-49 group.

Sucks see last surge think it’s basically we’ll start dropping like everyone else soon. really sucks ton counties probably going heading back phase 2 Monday though. Hopefully that’s short lived. Cases started dropping Chile expected 68 doses per 100 people, quite similar Israel saw daily case count steadily drop. Never heard peep people Israel Pfizer working. Weird! Oh deaths per capita remained low despite neighbors seeing surge (see Peru Brazil), yes working should. Stupid, greedy Americans care anyone doctor scientist little biology knowledge know take pain killer vaccine hinder effect since main goal let body fight weak virus hence inflammation/fever.

I know applies mRNA vaccines not. Yes, understand, guess point 80% + vaccinated, matter lockdown not, vulnerable populations largely removed chance death. failure though it. keep hearing ""every life matters"". whole premise restrictions brought US least last spring ""save Grandma"" U.K. full lockdown months, *just* opened retail outdoor dining last week single shot appears give previously infected people significantly protection two shots unvaccinated data also questions point giving infected people two shots, particularly given significantly worse reaction vaccination. We’re starting great we’re hitting tipping point vaccine demand. might start vaccines people want could/will issue regarding immunity. right outlook positive may turn concerning.  Yes, numbers continue drop. Deaths trailing indicator people dying could’ve caught Covid weeks ago. another month numbers drastically lower scenarios writing last person get vaccine. bulk population soon shots. Since getting tidal wave vaccines soon, think effect come record speeds, green passports used tiny number weeks anyway, all. Israel system enforced month so, open. 

Also need consider negative test results give freedoms vaccine. True helps people feel safer harmful, not? safety measures feeling safe safety itself.  Yeah tbh past four years enlightened goddamn stupid 40 percent us population is. It’s past saving, it’s time get fuck shit hole.   Yes, call people kiwis fruit kiwifruit avoid confusion! Well, Chinese doesn’t let us in, guess don’t mind restrictions. 

Also guess three ways enter country moving forward:

Approved vaccine immunization 

Negative test speed test taken boring

If testing and/or vaccine give clear status: quarantine Damn.  Canada massive brain fart? Seems like healthy people get short end stick. surprised that's immune systems active, cells better attacking themselves. Ironically, little *less* healthy scenario might better (at least that's tell myself). think find country, democratic no. Democratic probably important though, people actually voted government, likely next year. still comparably high say UK Israel similar levels vaccinations (arguably lockdowns Israel open), given 99% deaths 50+ surely drop low hundreds double digits soon...? Hahahahaha think mates wife died ripe old age 31 would love give slap deserve.

While red blooded Americans born raised refuse get it.

Taipei, May 2 (CNA) Taiwan Sunday confirmed four new domestic cases COVID-19, including three linked airport hotel cluster Taoyuan, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Three domestic cases husband, son daughter housekeeping employee Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, CECC said.

My takeaway? ever think people see, authors like, ever *truly* one accidents. us simply born place, develop without regard reared us. Nope, us fall far tree. Far stricter lockdown, higher vaccine approval longer jab interval system huge win, allowed us cover vulnerable far efficiently. Appreciated!  heart West Michigan here, “faith fear” can't visit friends family dinner cup tea. 

You can. Either outside via bubble/extended household rules. acknowledgement back normal throwing bone reluctant get bunkers. LA 1.2 million states 3.7 million cases. defining bad vs amazing? really don’t want guess going do.

I remember line Company Heroes:

""Work faster going shoot sabotage""

Yes, help all. Lol yes, time need mask. See situations change, science reflects that. investigation whether medical bodies receiving quality vaccine test actually sent used. let's close gyms parks force people stay inside...   appears think people arguing avoiding catching virus understand realtive personal risk virus. somehow misjudging dangerous virus is, likely catch - perhaps mis-evaluatimg risk virus compared effect behaviour (such less exercises due covid lockdown). perhaps think correctly adjusted age related risk profile - younger people misjudging personal risk death looking population level statistics skewed heavily toward older people? Perhaps also include risk injury and/or hospitalization too?

It clear believe people misjudging risks. taking action think would unwarranted given nature extent risk? simply fear element identifying? think maybe argument something like ""if really cared risks magnitude would also worried similarly proportioned risks, since complaining coivd risk things must misevaluating actual risk""?

I think personally three main concerns regards. Firstly, best way avoid spreading virus someone else may much higher risk avoid catching virus. Cannot spread virus have. Secondly yet know long term health impacts sars-cov2. look SARS widespread long-term injury caused younger people. mounting evidence even initally mild cases covid19 younger people result longer term injury, although even much common older people. Even initially mild cases lead long term symptoms, seem much correlatioj severity initial symptoms occurrence long term symptoms. Thirdly, quite unpleasant disease experince, even injury caused. Althoug younger people mild symptoms, still many - chances symptoms least 1 5 even 20year old. really want spread old colleagues unpleasant weeks even lead long term injury death. Many us large networks friends, family, etc, chances someone close us injured starts become quite high.

Even worse - regardless health risks directly associated current strains - seen far emergence multiple improved strains virus. rate emergence new strains highly correlated number people catch virus.

I wonder perhaps making error - rather others misevaluating risks - perhaps misevaluating kinds risks people might concerned about? didn’t see write anything US government post sure you’re even responding to. 

The way see America (deservedly) took lot shit last year. year wasn’t America means, American people / companies / governments stepped done great job that’s worth acknowledging shit show mismanagement was. lot people made COVID part identity. allows feel morally superior someone else actually core values own. Thanks Gretch, fault terrorists, treat such. confused Eagle, popular chain leather bars. believe Valneva current part mixed doses trials can't see getting approved mixed dosing late Autumn, currently track finished August. 

Novavax may used way, months ahead Valneva. question mark vaccinating children gets declared safe that.

That said actually approved new vaccines since Jan 8th knows see them. Lol literally traits commonly held beliefs throughout america, south slightly average ppl believe it. Fauci losing lot credibility point even CDC

Maybe focus people least getting one dose vaccine first since seems still major obstacle Even higher lower, matter long people vaccinated flip side alcoholic overweight 50+father law got covid unfazed it. mother law also mostly healthy go said like bad sinus infection. 

Really seems differ person person regardless health age. Well, also ms alabama highest percentage black ppl historically faired well trusting modern medicine. Paywall article Contra costa...sounds like name mafia family :)) relate. anxiety standing line everyone waiting shot #1 Deaths U.S. already lowest since last July. really wants football know
Edit: typo nothing politics. health procedures. vaccine producer create also pass registration procedured scientists make sure liquid created immune response. Russia decided good play common rules already lost months european markets. Fine vaccines companies respect european laws rules. Just... Stop. Combination rules vaccination. Uk much stricter rules (still mingling allowed indoors big one, family visits indoor pubs) plus higher first dose percentage us, 50 v 42, us reached figure opening ages - uk, vaccinations opened standard 40s yet, vaccinations given date much concentrated risk death (95% 50s vaccinated uk, us nowhere close coverage) Similarly brexit vote U.K. shifted leave got older got generation still remembers bad divided Europe get voted remain. trying stay safe inbred Michigan militia mouth breathers trying spread Covid them. It’s survival fittest point. Whatever happened J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine EU? 
I can't see data whether used (I think NL announced using everyone). 

Since deliveries resumed, I've unable find use vaccine started restricted like AZ. 
Trying find Nordic countries esp. gives shit makes vaccines done science right proven safe? UK started giving first doses much earlier USA (about three months ago really ramped up), numbers dropped steadily since then. USA done amazing job vaccinating many people quickly take time numbers drop level. COVID deaths figures represent people got sick least two weeks ago. letting idiots left want back reality struck them.

What idiots left? ones already away Australia swiftly shut border? ones living working overseas? ones went family? Get grip, people still stuck beginning pandemic. government given help people stuck overseas. fact think ""reality struck them"" shows little know situation. CNN reported today worldwide cases last 7 days short total first 5 months pandemic. Stupid people general never learned research. problem working class people know properly skeptically research. Michigander first hand, many people trust vaccine country anyone informed tries make people wear mask refuse vaccine. Recently exposed due friend friend family. quarantined immediately circle worried. UK bleak situation winter. quickly go control, saw India recently. Yes, actually use brains. None variants neutralize vaccines' ability prevent hospitalization death. We've lockdown 4 months since Christmas.

Cinemas, clubs, theatres, dine-in restaurants, indoor pubs, weddings, international travel, meeting people indoors still prohibited.

Only two households allowed meet outside, groups 6 less.

You see England's lockdown relaxation timeline here: Go back whatever shit state came from. LA bad... it. overwhelming majority state amazing.

But whatever.  What? family coronaviruses new. coronavirus way wrap virus mRNA ball. shaped ball mean mRNA inside. LA Hollywood explain damn vanity contained itself. also Jake Logan Paul, eww!

So speaking Bay, we're better you. know risk, yes... also know everyone risk... also know things hospitalizations deaths, since permanent loss smell without needing hospital... what's point? could anyone seen coming? Cool slogan! understand, mix various factors, less variant related might think.

1. India Diabetic pandemic, nearly 10% Indians either T1 T2 Diabetes related to... 

2. India obesity problem around 15% Obese 50% morbidly obese

3. Indians compared western countries, tend self medicate treat broken bones etc home vs doctors. factor could explain 30-40% Indians infected COVID19 require hospital treatment around 5% UK. simply attempt treat symptoms home end getting far far worse result.  immune system actually exceedingly good killing virus.  guess, but: sounds precautionary me. think they're simply broad criteria pregnancy related information gathering. feel like counties strong support restrictions, hat, silo medical resources counties.

You restrictions, consequences come that. y’all make fine. People waiting patients hospital beds die away get bed after. situation dire I’ve seen opposite, lockdowns live reduced number COVID deaths per capita, deaths rise restrictions loosened. GL Tuesday 14 days post 2nd shot yay!! normal study protocols want keep eye pregnancy even study participant male. Nothing unusual that. sure ""ok"" amount is. statistically 7500 deaths US every day. CDC's ""excess mortality"" chart shows we've average since March 6, takes catch love see covid deaths zero wonder long take. Numbers severally undercounted both. People don’t understand global pandemics limitations countries medical capacity shouldn’t make sweeping statements like this, totally wrong, may skills understanding see wrong are. mad repeating things told mad often stupid people people getting attitude women uncomfortable getting vaccine (not over) women pregnant breast feeding bewildering me. I’m vaccinated pro vaccine many pregnant women vaccinated ill effects, understand someone would hesitant since know nothing long term effects child. Well everyone 80 also 40 Aussies living ages want get virus-infested country return home safe? fuck guys too?

the proportion people left pandemic low. Aachen Vaals plenty bike paths too. literally can't close border point. Great news! I’m getting worried Indian variant :( So...vaccinate...   got shots meijer, first shot automatically scheduled #2 exact time 3 weeks later. don’t know that’s case everyone perfect. I’ve reckless possible still haven’t gotten it.  data ok cities poor rural areas (where 2/3 population lives).  say kiwi scientists confuse [honeydew mean still pretty bad 5% people first dose can't bothered 2nd dose. Next week Pfizer supply double (which coincides supply switching Kalamazoo plant, instead Europe) - 2 million week. also getting million doses Moderna, next week get 3 million doses, equivalent 10% eligible population, 7.5% total. likely administer close 3 mil next week alone, would put country almost exactly 40% population (probably bit under) first dose.

My hope start getting Moderna supply U.S. plant well instead Europe, consistent coming European facility. 

What's feel United States regarding Canada/Mexico starting get supply produced United States? still appetite vaccines Canada, imagine we'll hit wall Alabama hitting get 70% eligible adults, right we're 40, increasing percent day. United States comfortable sending bigger cut produced U.S. facilities, would likely tear it.

Honestly think big reason hungry vaccines envy, seeing unrestrained supply U.S. adhere strict lockdowns essentially year, hard feel envious. Might weirdly blessing disguise, imagine result Canada hitting high level vaccination quite quickly [this link says otherwise didn’t know Vancouver large homeless population. reason older population vaccinated.

Here’s protocol Pfizer’s website.

Bottom Page 67: 
“A female found pregnant exposed exposed study intervention due environmental exposure. examples environmental exposure pregnancy:  

• female family member healthcare provider reports pregnant exposed study intervention inhalation skin contact.”

So last sentence says environmental exposure occurs woman exposed vaccine inhalation skin contact — like open vial vaccine accidentally spilled.

So Page 67 pretty straightforward.

But top Page 68 says this: 
“A male family member healthcare provider exposed study intervention inhalation skin contact exposes female partner prior around time conception.”

How interpreted? man exposed vaccine accidentally inhalation skin contact, somehow get sperm? would female partner report EDP (Exposure Pregnancy) mate got exposed way?

Like someone else said China wants world use vaccines pulling stunts like us last summer exactly help People feeling safe take unnecessary risks. People understand why. intentionally undercounted. happening Delhi hypothetical yet IMO conservative figures daily basis hospitals limited icu beds/covid special ward beds admitting (lets say) 100 patients demand much higher, around 500 
2) lets say hospital able extend capacity additional 50 patients. 350 patients still left without beds
3) 350, 100 able arrange oxygen, medicines etc supply scarce moment lucky able get them. black market costs careful since fake remdesivir saline solutions sold everywhere
4) 250, lets say 50% able survive (very opportunistic figure). 125 survived, 125 died 
5) lets say day 20% patients passed away hospital, 20%*150= 30 died 
6) actual number people dead day per hypothetical scenario = 125+30 = 155
7) government reporting - hospital deaths 30. 
8) 30 19% 155. leave rest best judgment.  We've argument Britain domestic vaccine passports. Thank you, Michigan!! Checking represent team Pfizer two rounds. 💪💪 we’re seeing outbreaks? Vaccinations rolling better originally expected, we’re still around 30% population US fully vaccinated. gets around 60-70%, virus still spread fast (exponentially) mutate variants vaccines less effective (a lot variants already category). Even assume people COVID already “immune” like vaccinated people, might around 50%. constantly shows fucking dumb people are. Hitting gym eating healthy help combat things like obesity heart disease, fuck virus?

How people dumb? you’ve ever antibiotics you’ve likely one chance causing Also check back Advil bottle. NSAIDs also cause this.

Incidence disease around 1 million. doctor warned everyone getting antibiotic NSAID risk would terrifying patients providing beneficial information. patient would likely die drive home doctor’s office experience side effect. would u rather do? chest puffing articles cringeworthy. months back articles lauding India handling pandemic well rage  gotten vaccinated yet? reports long hauler symptoms disappearing vaccination (theory vaccine boosts breadth immune response helps clear virus viral reservoirs body causing low level infection). 🇨🇦 wish right. banned life asked vaccine question. Yeah that's true this? Yep... big reason specifically went Pfizer. Or, know, sent prison. They've probably run people 80. mRNA vaccines newer tech, even tech used vaccines before. That’s partly developed quickly, wasn’t scratch, existing work build (and 30+ years research). vaccines based 50+ year old tech widespread use vaccines. MRNA vaccine technology 10 years old. Educated yourself. 13% India's population gotten 1 shot, 1-2% gotten shots

1st shot provide lot protection Cool. needing hospital bed? long term side effects? strokes blood clots? I'm starting think keeping data. Working great, times great idea work home. There's lots home without needing go crowded gyms Handing control public health professionals automatically mean lockdowns, indeed, country never did.

There's lot done, including (but limited to) mask mandates compulsory quarantines legal teeth (in case, pretty massive fines), strongly enforced government. Even keeping politicians -- often idea they're talking -- picture huge help, public health officials directly addressing public (and taking questions) press conferences, rather clueless head government. could give convincing assessment situation, without seen political.

Our government made absolutely clear beginning take lives people economy, multiple tiers contingency plans place support economy successive level lockdown. Fortunately, test viability contingency plans far. first dose Pfizer made arm slightly hurt. 2nd dose nothing. Depends person. fully recovered.  

I didn’t get vaccinated, also fully recovered.  

At least 80% coworkers COVID back working.  real relatively minor symptoms, pretty sick couple weeks, none ended hospital. 

I certainly know local people died COVID, fortunately none close friends family major issues even though many even recovered.  

The percentage adults either COVID vaccinated remarkably high Michigan right now. many hoarded vaccine remaining? glass half full glass half empty type person?  That's prove virus fighting... like 6 confirmed variants Michigan, meanwhile schools still session face face makes sense. Sure. it’s almost guaranteed far educated scored higher variety aptitude tests.  feed misinformed trolls. events show deep parallels conservative extremist philosophies. might expect kinds actions Taliban, somehow Western fundamentalist leaders excused absolved responsibility things happen. lucky work outside also. might switch neck gator. Easy one easy plus sun protection. Let’s see goes. People wear bandana face that’s accepted businesses around here. Nose accepted mostly also. Pfizer/moderna 95% effective preventing disease, vaccination 80-85% effective.

Plus may need one dose covid! Yeah well, like nature: stupid finds way. comments trending Twitter two days attempted walk back.

“I'm doctor, I'm f---ing moron, I'm cage fighting commentator ... I'm respected source information, even me,” said.t see yourself...  completely true. huge number black people want vaccine literally trust government. that's perfectly good reason really not. 

LA HUGE tech community, one nation's leading cities startups years prior whole mess. mention know difference 'Survival rate' 'Population' two different numbers, fucking moron. may stupid question, ITP, disorder behind killings people taking vaccine, occur randomly? people get conditions make vulnerable? CDC says ok wear whatever find usually don’t wear one work outside employer doesn’t force outside  don’t think it’s bad. I’m young adult, I’d fine. 

How hard say “Oh it’s ok! I’m vaccinated” show card proves I’m vaccinated. 

Who cares? don’t wanna vaccinated get sick die. US everyone able get one unless legit reason able get it, responsibility them. needs many outweigh needs few, many ready get vaccinated forget shit show Great news, thanks posting this.

Got yesterday feel good last night today still happy took it. chills fever really bad night. Intermittent fasting probably help either. don’t personality It’s pretty hit miss here. can’t force people wear masks do, it’s also pretty conservative area they’re masks vaccine. don’t care either. wanna live life vaccine seems way go. don’t think lot people realize much desire eat tied pleasure get it, least they’ve experience losing it. (I lost mine couple months particular chemo.) 

It *huge* problem people chemotherapies, besides things mentioned, without pleasure taste, eating becomes nothing chore *have* do, like it, done. 

And often see comments “oh hey, I’d lose bunch weight wouldn’t eat,” that’s..really healthy way lose weight. (As opposed healthy, balanced diet physical activity, is.) Tomorrow I’m two weeks past second!  Looking many vacations summer lol Well first foremost, it’s nasty virus could kill you, give long-term health problems, least make feel awful while. honestly insane question, though getting take mask somehow *only* possible benefit getting vaccinated deadly virus. 

Past that, people don’t know you’re vaccinated, wearing mask simple courtesy around drawbacks. 

We can’t normal critical mass people vaccinated. then, continue treat situation bare minimum care deserves.   2 days! I’ve seen articles states/cities locking week, health ministry issuing guidance lockdowns, unified lockdown measures taken.

Do links better information? I’m hard time finding current lockdown info, lot comes pertains lockdown last year. RIP trial phases call people dont want dumb, people dont want calling others dumb want it. Welp... less wrong that. seems like vaccines produce piece spike protein rather whole thing. So... there's that. Greece, Croatia, Cyprus opening vaccinated travelers month. think reality India probably worst world right enough testing capture real number. 50% positivity rate tests right now. atrocious. mean, hospitals India literally collapsing. age I'm probably great risk dieing COVID19, I'm worried need medical care reason, might completely available.

I don’t get it. another con happening end May Austin. masks required social distancing still happening.

I get akon cancelling did. con June much bigger two people coming guests events. time vaccine situation much different many moving parts punting probably seemed like safer bet.

When con supposed happen last weekend July three months vaccines available Gen pop. Even wanted keep masks distancing logical reason cancelling things late.

It isn’t going help convince younger people getting vaccine see things love keep getting cancelled boomers return normal lives. Wow jealous.  I’m starting believe happen coming months city general population vaccination implemented everyone lives US. Gyms still appointment much Europe.

Let's jump gun. 3 months see countries including US managed decide what. take time. Enjoy freedom! Also people make mistakes time people pay price. 'perfectly safe, side effects' kinda wrong. 'nobody gets vaccine dies covid' exactly true. Yes extremely small risk people seeing mixed information trust government pharma companies. still kind BS governments onboard vaccines.

That said many conservative friends family gotten shots said planned to. Versus what? authoratative statement made you? realize footing internet strangers... two peaks pandemic? gonna may It’s funny headlines be.

Yea dude huge self centered fuckass worry, US fighting rights “citizen-journalists” freed voices heard!!!!

Freedom Expression matters. start accepting vaccines otherwise means majority humans won’t allowed travel EU. thought like masons, married dudes trying get away wives minute networking well. like generally young necessarily old either. generational divides, particular president's party &amp; popularity individual's formative years (mid-teens mid 20s, roughly).

6k dead vs 590k dead

We held ground... matter what!!! name magic surface coating: bleach, soap, sunlight. feels like April 2020 “discovery.”  Well yeah, per article 74% old people vaccinated vs. much lower numbers younger groups. makes sense younger people hospitalized... vulnerable vax. Sputnik liquid qualified real vaccine EMA using change status travelers. spending money, time effort travelling country pandemic. Strange move, imo problem length time vaccinations count vaccinated. Prio 4. likely even children get vaccinated me. want back school. 5 weeks 2 shots 2 weeks second full protection, take likely September full rights back.

Also EU start accepting vaccines valid want allow vaccinated people travel here. want exclude world? thread deaths though, cases. fact less age 60+ people died recently vaccines thats whats shaved large chunk daily death figure. Communication government pretty bad. people believe vaccinated 2022 (like guy video). Since get freedom back vaccination, people get desperate. gotten vaccinated/completing regimen now

If 16-44 conditions list, eligible Oregon April 19.  Assuming able get vaccine first day possible got Pfiser vaccine, can't get second dose May 10, considered fully protected May 24. got Moderna, add week (May 31). get appointment first day getting June people got vaccinated soon possibly could. likely undercutting purpose. Cnn report government Claimed 2 people died day hospital, Cnn 4 hours saw 6 people die. 

There also specific rules bury covid dead. official number 20x lower special burials. even know daily UK deaths January? party on! help viruses though... Use whatever chemical want lab whatever; I'll stick soap water thanks. question whether would gain rights anyway none Russian vaccines approved EU (yet). receive second dose til late July/August either, risk vaccination count registered vaccine cards (all vaccinations given Denmark registered electronic medical record). 50 super old now? Yes, think freedoms count German approved vaccines. I’d say chance getting vaccine Germany Sputnik approved pretty high now, vaccination picking speed rapidly. Almost everyone vaccine next month. way around. indeed intentionally undercounted. Multiple covid speciality hospitals seen reporting 50-200 deaths per day per ground reports counting crematoriums Surat, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Delhi etc. many states reporting 5-10 times fewer deaths.  Right, real cases coronavirus deaths may many times reported, verified numbers pyres, graveyards! China also mRNA vaccine candidate coming around Q3-Q4 year, called ARcov vaccine, currently undergoing phase 3 strange people's experience differ. 

I walked local Meijer, idea vaccines, got one spot lol.  

I like, ""oh okay cool"". appointments anything. reiterate - fucking dumb. LA people generally dumber bay area ask me.

Having lived LA Bay Area, priorities people Socal often baffling confuse hell me. Lol. Yeah never comment China either upvoted downvoted oblivion based brigade notices thread. Sorry, simply believe engaged conversation obese individual tone un-vaccinated.

There mass disinformation obesity.

[First all, sugar industry paid scientists redirect attention completely skewed peoples understanding health, government institutions pushed this.

Today massive growing movement 'HAES' health every size people claiming fat healthy.

You big magazines featuring morbidly obese 'models,' celebrating looks. 

Obesity large factor COVID took many lives, studied data would know true.

Practically one aggressively obese people reckless choices impacts others society, yet many parallels negative outcomes obesity covid.

Also, obesity serious covid. claimed many more, continue claim many more.

I raise shows concern really deep conviction based principle take hospital beds due reckless decision making educated, still resistant compelled. greater cross combating obesity un-vaccinated, don't.

If history tone towards obese people would tip hat truly unique example someone taking principled stances important health issues regardless popular were.  Germany started give fully vaccinated people rights. Young people like going reach status fully vaccinated September, that. created 2 class system. understand people travel get vaccinated. would same. fact, think first person tried use population density province/state/region relation death rate ever. dumbest fucking metric ever seen. Ontario huge, 75% population live near one city. Manitoba bigger Germany, 60% population lives one city.

Long story short, population density nothing covid-19 death rates. Look deaths per capita. year ago saw list vaccines development. 72 separate vaccines. also mRNA vaccine phase 2 3 (unsure), google says called ARCoV.

Edit: article - Everybody knows aren’t going pre-pandemic levels normalcy. Covid loom background like flu, life continue. lot change vaccinated. Even China's ability mobilize people greater wealth manufacturing resource compared India, managed magically swap pandemic two nations, China's health system wider economy would collapse short order well.

Back January Feb 2020 China able focus resources Hubei province also enforce varying degrees lockdowns everywhere else one time, allowed suppress pandemic early. virus gotten Hubei significant scale, even would trouble stamping out, becomes fully endemic like India now, nobody stop point.

At point India literally covid burn actual people.  Reddit already made mind!!! dn't dare compromise science data shit... getdafuckouttahere oldest people alive generally left leaning elderly.

Sorry, what? example divide 65-86 years old two groups, 65-75 versus 76-86, older group likely left leaning younger group? getting data voting distribution elderly supports assertion like this? Oh, celebrating California right. lowest covid positivity rate lowest antivaxxer rate country, we’ve opening like normal.

Enjoy lockdown! head Yen Bai health dept already suspended job investigation. Depending things go, may get prison charge epidemic control violation. previous chair leader Hanoi got 10 years embezzlement epidemic control fund. Dirtier NYC, anything. easy solutions here.

It’s nice thought still foolish practice. telling got anti-vaxxers outside U.S. bc reddit american website? Nope. Military contractors.

It’s shittyness public knowledge many years now.  hope live NYC, cause live Tokyo Singapore, that's going much test. Cleanest trains I've ever seen. OH, PA non-extreme states (which included study) show similar trajectory death rates vs lockdown. Thankfully weren’t hit hard, point is, pattern exists consistent. wanted data shows correlation, gave you. entire population South America actually less THIRD india  think Bay Area better, theres definitely lot people skeptical

Indeed. stats SantaClara county (San Jose (70% eligible population) got first dose. bad.. still leaves 470K eligible-but-not-vaccinated number first doses administered falling quickly (last Friday 3.5K).

My guess would Santa Clara reach 75% mark Like Faschists countries ww2. heavily believed right. comment custody issue. completely different debate. 

One yourself. 

All challenge ignored cause death children. 

So stop saying killing children since know is. 

Yes numbers small. hope drop zero soon. 

But Ontario million kids Canada even more. even though risk thankfully really low, still real.

And swimming pools risky irresponsible adults watch kids and/or fence properly. 

I actually like swimming pools safe place teach children swim, world people live water vital skill. 

And swimming pools made safe. 

Viruses different. explosive exponential growth become deadlier time. 

But also beaten vaccines masks. 

And people fighting efforts putting completely innocent children world risk good reason. 

I agree people exaggerate risk due children. 

But downplaying risk acceptable either. 

Both make likely people take disease like measles polio seriously, viruses absolutely target children much greater risk injury death. 

But actually countries (namely ones took COVID-19 seriously) pediatric deaths. 

Just mine certainly Brazil. 

Because end day, whatever judges decide custody, parents still going losing children people spreading lies viruses enough get kids killed. places US. Honestly, point staying local? virus everywhere. What's risk traveling one state another similar vaccine case rate? truth trolling? excuse used parents kids time internet, didn’t access lot information. Nowadays excuse parent give child soda. 5 year old one sip whole life, drank dads drink thinking something else. spat said “spicy”. 3 year old never soda all. quit drinking soda many years ago take sip long, realize awful actually tastes. truly don’t believe kids instantly like soda. think continuous exposure parents allow makes like it. I'm looking deaths per capita sad high Canada's is. makes feel fortunate South Korea.

That's takeaway, anyway Serious question... patents really stopping facilities India processing? thought mrna vaccines required specific expensive machinery, trained people validate processing keeping things proper temperature. Even places IP would capability overcome processing bottleneck? thought Indian companies slowed vaccine production don’t resources (people material).

Another question even opened IP, countries would still require different companies producing vaccines go trials, would months scale, wouldn’t necessarily help people India.

In case, sure really needed it, trying prevent headache getting worse (I suffer migraines pressure build felt same).

Either way glad fully vaccinated.

But wish evident literature. None said avoid NSAIDs analgesics prior getting second shot, one asked taken prior getting jabbed, anyone say ""Take em need em, need em.""

Wish awareness. also done lot reading too, put blame anything else. Isn’t 95% protection almost 100% protection hospitalization? Healthy young people already .1% chance even hospitalized P vaccine offering 95% protection wouldn’t really convince many get it. think fully vaccinated (two weeks second dose), quite good protecting severe covid middle period gotten one dose second, basically protection continue cautious get second. guarantee restrictions would permanently months? think government did, know going happen. do. vaccine rollout going fast. Again, see Israel end result. understand thought processes people too.

They're wrong, they're fundamentally deluded, certainly arguable delusional misunderstanding true position endangers people, society general. highly unlikely persuaded revise opinion, philosophically question oblige accept vaccination.

I'm advocating that, see question. Sorry spam, criticising article picking absolute metric full picture [much death rate drop oldies 76% aggressive increase cases among younger people. Focusing hospitalisations may well humanising data news papers headline. data analyst offended full data paints lot positive light.

The red numbers “bad” green “good” many contracted already? many can't get vaccine due medical reasons religious reasons? Simply put try best want can't force people get matter what. numbers drop point go back normal eventually. Infected, yeah. divide population, like doing. take death rate infected rate. go math me, please. absolutely terrible.

When pandemic still early days, looked low numbers Turkey, wondered true were. Even now, look numbers Russia China, wonder true are.

From perspective, cannot understand Turkish people, majority them, supported, voted Erdogan. out?

When ""coup"" attempt him, years ago, real story? create whole thing himself? dunno. took eight months get Real ID drivers license, process begun seventeen years legislation passed. bet government could gotten vaccine within decade **really** focused. agree stance people need transition new skills demand older skills wane. 


However, people need survive, financial assistance temporary best. necessary though. northeast wildly different parts US, vaccination rates parts hurt MA's effort rate travel states, specifically around Boston Cape Cod.

That's good know! honestly able find much info results past mRNA vaccine trials, links could check out? Chile uses mostly Sinovac (just like Brazil) summer Chile. Enough people vaccinated worry virus anymore... think Kentucky setting vaccine sites sports games? Brilliant. Chile primarily uses CoronaVac, near-zero efficacy single dose, ~55% full two doses. might lead hemisphere terms number people gotten least one dose, mean much vaccine nothing single dose. need enough data verify person showing vaccine passport actually person vaccine passport belongs, means need way show Joe Bloggs person standing claiming Joe Bloggs. Bc vaccinated people barely spread far people gonna get vaxxed carrot, net positive. Also u dumb opinion expect get downvoted lmfao It’s. normal way present data it’s pictured head made comment say curve, mean shape graph simple way view complicated trend shape chart determines chan 264mm Americans eligible vaccine like 144mm received least one dose.

That means Americans eligible even started process yet, daily rate first doses plummeting. get virtual cons last year. one knew long happening vaccine.

Misinformation issue here. Sometimes, you’ll unfortunately get downvoted mentioning facts. run-in someone seemingly took offence clarification said “Anything stops transmission […]” reference vaccines. mentioned vaccines don’t stop transmission. It’s reduced. vaccinated people even high viral load infect others. also made sure mention benefits getting vaccinated it’s still good thing helps everyone.  Damn, kind slave hell would US institutions like grade schools, medical care facilities, universities could mandate vaccines? even imagine? poor suffering people. trump taken credit yet? mean, it’s accurate it’s accurate.

That's bullshit stereotype. english pls “It die eventually” policy first 9 months virus - worked really well. Enjoy freedumb.  defense production act means make US contract first. US contract price per dose.

The reason US getting first doses negotiated first highest reimbursement contract. vaccine manufactures reason make many doses fast possible. contracts every country.

This isn’t software marginal production trivial. entirely limited supply. India already IP contracts manufacture three vaccines. limited raw materials. sky blue. NJ's Covid website calculated Reproduction # 0.46 absolutely remarkable. April 1st today, 7 day average went 4,648 cases 1,936. 58% reduction calendar month. 2/3 Adults already receiving first dose think COVID state. OK I'm confused, seem complaining people staying unemployment, advocating policy keeps people unemployment longer?

A lot people want get back work unemployment nightmare deal with, want risk losing refile someone something like Governor Oregon forced unemployed, again.

Which it, want people unemployment? want stop shutting things down? Starter comment. logic solid, support message, it'll tough sell every province territory. Canada's government system decentralized design: short declaring state emergency, know federal government do.

Oh yeah agree wholeheartedly. saying people shitting USA before... understand why. yeah shitty people handled pandemic absolutely vaccinating everyone soon can. Ok glad I'm fully vaccinated (fuck 4-month gap bullshit) long last, I'm pretty pissed tax-paying Americans living abroad left fend themselves. Oh, no, quite easy getting candy haha

You fend chose repatriate pandemic started... understood time, least understood it, maybe make clear enough press conferences shit. remember people reddit like ""lol would ever want live USA! LOL MURICA BAD!"" back then. making fun government telling citizens abroad repatriate lol. serious heartless? friends Canada whose parent gotten first dose months still waiting get second scheduled due limited supply.

There's reason think known variant would escape vaccines, yet. Italy idiots commiting terror attacks too?

Unfortunately, Reddit users, correct - seem care all. Apparently 'life' simply amounts survival, quality life simply swept rug.

I’ve already seen response. “Just precaution” doesn’t satisfy bots sensitive morning. Masks works...but would argue people think. High quality tight fitting masks like kf94/n95 absolutely work people think, debate. Cloth mask cheapo surgical masks good source control, help keep droplets contained. thing one ever mentions covid infection duration.

Dizziness intensified didn’t feel comfortable driving annoying headache day. Side effects subsided time laid bed night.  needed vote people working good faith combat virus need get vaccines get passed thing. climate change don’t need two things. 

There’s climate change shot. could ask recycle think major changes need done policy. Regulating companies also setting things people won’t fuck earth. We’re always going annoying people pandemic particular case really need participation voting. 

Let’s say recycling really important. don’t know numbers overall important it’s something generally need participate in. mechanical sorters waste pulls recycling. government puts incentives people/companies invent better better tech area, don’t need people participate. Maybe doesn’t fully work reason point planets survival shouldn’t based individuals making decisions. need processes. 

TLDR: pandemic needed votes vaccines. climate change think mostly need votes. 好 able survive necessarily equal able transmit. People can't forever... May average 30M vaccines delivered EU per week. think qualify flooding metric. June see even more. 

I don’t know priority groups set live, read countries EU actually ahead schedule. Considering easily thing mutates? likely getting yearly vaccines much like influenza. Antivaxers harmless idiots say... Think again.  work endgame anyway.  sub worst anything narrative what’re ya gonna do. They're legit stupid people earth. believe Covaxin (the Indian vaccine) studied variant shown works. Research still needed Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, AZ, use different biotechnology Covaxin. Fingers crossed, don’t know yet.

Some good news far classifying one “Variant Interest” instead “Variant Concern.” Transmission matter people much get sick. r/lostredditors 

Got lost made look like idiot 💀 bad fam, great day. Imma remember randomly 10 years I’m trying sleep. sure. Pretty much everywhere laws torn apart extremely fast allow restrictions. UK already position restrictions stay least June. hope right common sense prevails. far Grow up. public made aware blood clots (happening similar rate) -potentially- linked J&amp;J vaccine, shots stopped entirely U.S.

However, given choice J&amp;J vaccine vaccine, I'd line heartbeat.

I'm confused believe SJS warning Advil bottles supports idea public made aware rare side-effects/symptoms ... warning label literally I'm arguing for. one places Canada live outdoors winter. say ""some"". And? AZ could thing thought worth PR gained level government competence. astounding terrible Trump administration covid. doses Pfizer back January. Never issues. Seems like I'm minority though everyone else talk sort adverse effect. mom told doctor said people virus get worse side effects vaccine (she COVID November). Oh live Utrecht, really ""never"" much ""I'll avoiding center Saturday much can"", easily right :) Uh, thread covid, man. Yeah one infected person every country around world one point too. know last person get vaccine?

You speaking coming wave vaccines flooding continent sub since January. Like Fl Texas? Weird fine :) seem think people understand concept cause effect. 

They don’t. 

They understand yelling. 

Whoever feels loud enough wins. That’s science works. La people objectively less smart. People move LA models movie stars. People move SF work tech. It’s really simple.  know that. Seems like ramping quickly Quebec want morons either. got mine last Thursday told second dose August 5 (14 weeks later) call back reschedule June pretty sure could end coming sooner well. side effects roughly four days, albeit fairly minor. case ran energy early afternoon headed couch naps watching Star Trek cats. day 5 finally felt back again. (Granted, allergies also acting double whammy working me)

Hope feeling better time see comment! see issue; showing %s deciding points time compare. Maybe chart drawing wrong?  It’s possible guess whole state surging right now, Saturday Washington (7.6 mil population) reported new cases-1549 California (39.5 mil population) 1540 new cases. 70 million Americans *literally anything* says, moment sooner dumbfucks blocked entrance Dodger’s stadium protesting vaccination back end Jan.

Yes, wearing mask akin prison   Thanks clarifying. obviously realize that. Im going look now, maybe know. 

I thought Mrna vaccines worked targeting removing spike protein rather binding it. wrong that? not, defintion antigen potentially outdated development Mrna vaccines?

Ps trying lazy conversation left work already. situation unfortunate completely avoidable. meaningful science based restrictions people followed properly. would work shorter period. also many jobs could find mean time. farm desperately looking people one willing work.  hard hitting irish times. 3 months late story  anti-vaxxers: “*it’s choice get one never get one!!!!!!!*”  every country maybe every country maybe Well yes no, arent hurting people beliefs far im aware... Seeing fraction south america decreasing since february, bit strange say ""drives"" record. Indian here. city’s recording ~30,000 cases daily. that’s number people tested. personal experience, selected privileged enough get hold RTPCR test. Every third person who’s getting tested positive city. We’ve complete lockdown week, seems respite now. people see vaccines status symbol sorts refuse anything Pfizer. want ""the good one""

Waiting AZ shot least 15 people came in, found AZ left. 20 minutes.

It's beyond ridiculous. maddening.  Lol, like special idiots, that's kinda brand days. People already disrupted vaccination sites destroyed vaccines US. Evangelicals hopping anti-vax train stem cells firebombing clinics jam. list people care point pretty small, vaccinated.  I’ve never met single person that’s fit loves working mocks anyone else’s workouts, ever. We’re supportive everyone else’s journey, wherever it. I’m guessing don’t running think 9 miles something laugh at... isn’t. You’re ass Actually enough adults first shot end May. moved again. :) Interesting.

Funny that's panned anywhere. Care explain performers, bartenders, they've unemployed year even numbers low countries locking early? Shouldn’t send jail, IMO. Make work orderlies COVID unit. Let make impression. Problem first two effect anyone else last one does. getting vaccinated puts others risk. Wtf? Covid exist. There's denial. I'm liberal gets, take freedom away disease hardly kills 80 ignorant. Maybe I'm classic liberal sense freedom important government bullshit, especially can't prove statistically disease deadly enough warrant taking away liberties. extended lockdown?

Indoor dining, gyms, salons, non essential businesses etc. shut Toronto since October 10th. coming 7 months. extended know is. Im literally asking. Dick. 

Telling people wear masks 50% vaccinated yet seems sketch. hey, I'm doctor know.  boat. gigantic 15 yr old football player can’t get vaccine September. Thought lying yes many implications esp travel. Unfortunately, yes.

And I’ll enjoy full vaccination!

You don’t get full benefits 2 weeks second shot anyway, timeline lines up. mom (almost 69) one 65+ holdouts insane anti-vax friends. Hoping praying changes mind soon. like myth noble savage. Define ""works."" brakes invented, first set brakes stopped car 50% time ""worked."" brakes stopped car 99% time ""work."" masks helped lesson spread covid. Yes. cloth masks prevent transmission. No. Would infections death MASSIVELY LESS people wore good mask pandemic. Absolutely admit UK much worse Germany second wave Germany still mishandled second wave badly listened scientists October. 60 thousand deaths could prevented since November. Either Republicans good anti vaxxer considered crime punished capital death  We've also Kumbh Mela attended millions also election rallies state elections. Joke's you, made even terrible decisions. 

The Central government joke probably getting another term 2022. quarantine 2 weeks upon return?   know anything india variant yet?  NZ Australia. Singapore similar strategy. U.K. Variant dominant Ontario. Bad apples man. like rap police get states. Alot good done, lots snakes assholes committing atrocities too. tried understand mean, impossible. ""We must use weapon ‘fear’"", mean talking Covid fear? go away even talk it. enemy? care people vaccinate themselves, could also save lives already 50 years olds.

Would happy situation like India right now? like used Italy?  Anti vax people militant enough, created new rumor vaccinated people shed virus particles nearby unvaccinated people, hence causing anti vax types want one get vaccinated.

There video going around recently CMA saying it. Trusting cma medical advise like asking stenographer bailiff represent court.

I know anywhere else, area cmas girls partied much high school, skipped college sex drugs phase, time ready end slutty phase lot career choices felt like adult career minimal training. can't even begin tell many cmas knew one point single moms teens early twenties coked one night stands.   **article**

the Woah, actually pro-virus terrorists now? Way go, humanity. anti-vax movement basically older USA, Canada, Australia New Zealand... agree vaccine gay stuff free, dont agree abortion, freedom someone stops hurts freedom another, one right killing human being, fact womb mother doesnt give right mother take his/her life. absolutely astounding many people view infanticide right, western societies dont give damn social issues, make money go extent normalizing murder, hope future learn mistakes past consider life embryo fetus important human being, human being, human cells development even didnt take first breath. doc_trucks. Thanks info. one same. worked wave comparable UK, would 33k deaths per day, terrifying figure, sounds like much worse, knows real numbers are. getting at? Yes obviously miss cases test less also work 1:1 basis. people really need get tested get test. testing likely find many negatives compared initial group. could 10k tests instead 5% positive could likely 1% group. 

Now also look stats like hospitalizations, ICUs etc. B.C. bad although see might think home past year spend free time mean people internet... I’m sure know we’ll adjusted means Nice generalization lol reddit eviscerating people generalize race, gender, etc comes religion, edgier comment, upvotes. Bracing downvotes

Disclaimer: I’ve gotten vaccine, studied top 10 uni (top 1 cs), Christian, pro-science, generally think religion wack things, again, generalizations completely bad faith dont see “liberal” community keep getting away it. article, also got impression high contact high exposure surfaces. example gave managed quarantine know people infected higher risk fomite transmission.

Not every advance meant used general public, still worth talked about. post old article ""snopes"".  page planely says claim,  ""A Stanford/NIH study concluded face masks worn prevent COVID-19 transmission work"" TRUE.

The reason imagine posting drivel is, get look ads. think USA, Europe, ""developed"" nations much sooner terms return full normal. agree regards developing world. Resistance Sputnik nothing anti vaxx nobody ever prooved Sputnik vaccine. Recent events Argentina despite fact wide usage russian liquid last week new sad record c19 cases nimber proove Sputnik effective russian reports only. Referring 60 countries also cheap move can't list countries speak countries rejected accept russian liquid vaccine. Thank concern! much iirc get control worldwide.

Some countries even started vaccinate, we're starting see people vaccinated getting reinfected. health care system back normal??

What country right now?? Foreign aid coming right now. However logistics inefficient hospitals still lack oxygen Remdesivir hence people still dying massive numbers, official count nowhere near actual numbers. Worst hit areas national capital states like Maharashtra Karnataka. Luckily Northeastern region India I'm seen fewer cases state average 3000-3500 per day. Thank concern! body directly affects people, no. Exactly drunk driving illegal, too. medical doctor. nearly people clotting side effect young women.

""For 12- 16-year-olds, 15 percent least one lingering symptom."" mean...Can really say Brazil is? Yep fuck that. Thank goodness there’s vaccine Why? rare people tell experience without exaggerating shit it? right is, got number? Another day. Another useless UN warning. many times UN warned, decried, condemned happening Myanmar now? Totally useless. Covid new. lysol cans decades. new strain. exactly looking for, close -  regulatory body approved 5 vaccines? gather, listening Dr. Fauci unwise. time event offered second opinion.

Edit: wife got did. saw someone Facebook mention shots given church Ecorse, slid see could get in, did. largely effect restrictions rather vaccines. tell huge divergence decline cases age groups, vaccination done mainly age UK. *some* effect vaccines, decline cases due vaccine. considerable proportion presumably -- could still get serious increases cases hospitalisations lifting restrictions, according SPIMO, government agency epidemiological modelling British government.

Read article. Looks like includes public transit too, fine people ride subway keep wearing them, it’s nice breathe whatever coming mouth nose past year. Myself, 44k others Pfizer trial, fast coming one year anniversary first injection. reward good. thing happened me. Take easy week. always go harder following week It’s called college education. Hence, need stop flights India asap. guess Tue do. Walgreens automatically scheduled second dose booked first. Getting 2nd shot days, feel anything first. Yeah. meijer Wayne county health dept. tons open spots. Never got communication meijer after, Wayne county called see ok. Would person vaccine test positive antibodies?

Also, way donate antibodies? donating blood? Less 100 total. Besides makes sense vaccinate vulnerable anywhere first, young, healthy people rich countries good health systems.

**Take care others. cannot help others struggling.** One relative's entire society 1500 flats declared large outbreak site sealed 3 days.

How many people would living there? must run thousands? serious man? lot south america lot devloped populated india. Also india producing lot world’s vaccine medicine rn. Thats god dang important odds dying covid significantly higher, talking Haha Germany welcome get much Sinovac Sinopharm want. We'll gladly take AZ vaccines. scenes European TV people India fighting breath hospital parking lots gurneys open air traumatic, horrifying. Actually asymptomatic 10 days positive test. yeah either way they're going school waaay soon. Nope. Thanks, vaccines. got second right 4 week, recommended mark. first ... drive through. even get car. schedule wife day .. one trip.

I would encourage everyone so. Another week (i got second 7 days ago) going resume normal life. probably still wear mask crowded places, avoid eating restaurant .. particularly less crowded ones ... anymore. would imagine full vaccination would necessary. looking Ireland vaccine wise, think that’s you’ll get first shot? one wants this, either side political aisle. look daily death announcements (which seem average 4-6 people day), vast majority 80s 90s. half peak terms hospitalizations, yet essentially signing execution warrants small business restaurants portland. We’ve already lost many.... lack access vaccines? alabama abundance mode now, many alabamans live outside urban centers, plenty places get within easy driving range. cant drive programs place free transportation, nevermind mobile vax programs popping around place way right. Michigan two years. mind thinks Detroit Ann Arbor basically place, even though shouldn't. Overlooked Kalamazoo completely. get poll political affiliation lol long COVID, main infection.  keep laissez faire approach may well get point legitimately unable normal society supervirus extremely high mortality rate.

That's completely wrong.  Ye that’s I’m talking Woooaahhh long side effects last y’all? I’m 28 hours post second Pfizer shot feel terrible. Fever, body aches, muscle spasms... Doesn’t seem like “unwise” strong enough? about: “to protect population everyone must get two doses.” “COVID19 passports invalid without second dose.” Picking bit? That’s good sign Oh goody there’s 😩 Somebody tell damn anti vaxxers FFS. Yeah, hard time thinking things correct, seemingly time. low hanging fruit got shot, spread others, time?

Its also funny hear different areas doctors handled differently. parents got done doctor, neighbor, age, never heard anything anything. Hell, ""16 over"", got texted three times set appointment Meijer Kroger next day. doctor never checked see going shots, worth. Yes. I'm fully expected need wear mask condo common areas rest year, Chicago. Wdym? Stop spreading misinformation. CDC says teenager 25x less likely hospitalized 50 yr old 440x less likely due. along teenagers get compared adults pretty rare. death count definitely underreported. margin, can't even imagine. Everyone speak to, friends, colleagues, social media groups, everyone saying someone know succumbed deadly virus. Probably every Indian known someone dead virus. 
And going hospital coming back. Many getting beds majority getting dying( late treatment? ). one Michiganders morning 2nd Pfizer dose, patiently waiting train hit me. Less 100 total, 1/7 deaths day right? mean, older groups vaccinated stat would seem least anecdotal evidence are. elderly person living home anyone that's senior citizen living home. includes (among others) minorities live multigeneration family homes parents often work jobs expose many kids forced go school.  practical segregate seniors stayed home people delivering frood multigenerational homes ones forced babysit grandkids due economic reasons. Still overall, seniors whole average greater risk. Science tells us senior group gone first. decision entirely political,  I'm pretty sure US almost year ago. /s India's atrocious news media help either. Let's pretend Modi's fault. media whole ""Indians largely immune Coronavirus"" entire year. Hey know find graph comparing # vaccines administered vs new positive cases? wasn’t talking long COVID, talking severe disease course like guy blood clots lungs mentioned comments up. That’s I’m saying shouldn’t spotlight. Dying something protect single injection height stupidity. Right. changed dramatically. can’t give away shots now. seems everyone wants it, gotten it. weird went scrambling find appointment “come down, shots available”. Maybe enough manpower administer shots rate locations desire, least moving forward direction! :) 

Happy got vaccinated! Read what, propaganda? Pre-internet, health info reliably available, people go libraries hope reading something accurate, unfortunately accurate health info short supply due disinformation. bad right mass vaccination sites make problem worse. understanding CDC guidance based trials results vaccine manufacturers gave FDA. 

... included data showing efficacy one shot 3 weeks later better efficacy J&amp;J *at maximum efficacy*. data. got walloped first round

Everyone know either vaccine caught rona...about 50/50 ratio worldometer 16 thousand less cases last saturday Maybe wasn’t good idea campaign able “trust” vaccine admin power developed? *ducks* Never believe anything unless live there, btw reddit  Yup. May US still seeing 700-1000 deaths per day. Getting first doses definitely bigger problem. Username check know tried this, takes lot manual checking websites locations process lack supply, logistical problems, lack interest? think point young people dont generally get absolutely wrecked it, couldnt get it. also know risk hospitalizations deaths. way predict shutting restaurants save lives don’t actual data tying restaurants spread. speculation. Utah restaurants open year since initial shutdown deaths mirror Oregon. way bounds risk reward scale. Yeah, Central Oregonian here. able get first shot 8 days ago. Reading lines browsing Instagram, think lot peers lied preconditions get earlier, willing that.

So politician, I'd plan 6-7 weeks everyone wants one fair chance get one, they're actually fully protected lot restrictions lift. Obviously getting shot relief, science says need stay safe end May. Which, is, uh, Memorial Day, trying extend anything past fruitless anyway. vaccine rush job. I'm dummy wonder mask mansates lifted. hospotals verge overwhelmed? spike protein segments produced result mRNA vaccines function spike proteins actual CV, fake virus discussed study. vaccine-produced spike proteins attach Ace2 negligibly small level. How/where produced present body, really chance almost contained INSIDE individual cells.

[This video pretty thorough discusses thorough explanation spike protein replication works various vaccines. :) Get 2nd shot!

Last... realize millions people received Pfizer/Moderna vaccines point. going start coronary issues result they'd showing up, like negligibly small clotting issues vaccines showed up. Think crazy careful 6 people clotting issue J&amp;J halted giving shots. issues popping mRNA vaccines they'd treated exact J&amp;J. working fantastically. it, signed ""2nd dose"" appointment (I got vaccinated way January still like that). ask specifiy. could probably even rite aid and/or walk-in site. they're trying get needles arms now! Boston reopening aug 22 Oh wow cool. expect guy. remember reading books high school college mind blown string theory stuff. make much sense draw lines different restriction levels *within* counties...

Why though? counties huge. NYC (there designated covid hotzones additional restrictions).

In fact sort strategy ideal outbreak small concentrated one area. forgetting vaccine rish job.

There risks thst explains young, healthy people least likely want vaccinated. Excellent. need non-American vacccines. I'm bloody well tired trying run everything. Because, them, it’s communism lives care own. Like it’s one thing say don’t want vaccine afraid effects want wait little longer, it’s another shame others want take spreading sharing misinformation. Even reason get everyone vaccinated ASAP. America actually great job this. I’m Australia we’re thousands doses day instead hundreds thousands. checked long time ago

A good update today numbers almost matching last week! 

J&amp;J starting ramp back 87k reported today (64k yesterday, 42k day before). Hopefully J&amp;J back shift mega-sites micro-sites keep numbers 1m little longer.

Also 65+ crowd sneakly getting pretty damn high. going slow steady. Hopefully see 85%+ point. That’s vaccines staggered still don’t know shit covid theory you’re young healthy there’s lower risk Cool, tell India right Cases low look leveling week. Lowest deaths since March 2020. ridiculous knee jerk. like picking scab. pick longer takes heal. people arnt brightest. see you’re American. Canada entirely different situation. ramping now, vaccinations still behind US, combination multiple variants appear effecting younger populations. province next door (Ontario) vaccinated elderly reached ICU capacity first time pandemic, getting ready triage care.

Who knows Indian variant, something else, bad. Yeah need job. miss grandma sign appointment, need specify I've already first? schedule like first appointment? MI, America's facepalm reasoning doesn’t matter, still plane. folks visiting family same. 

Sucks doesn’t wouldn’t say great shape. Decent shape sure. Cases reported aren’t going much far vaccinations- yes lot people vaccinated numbers dropping CDC would like see. People even skipping 2nd doses. far done this. Things won’t back normal end year earliest. likely early next year. Oregonian here. Portland. governor way line lock down. 50 deaths April. best exaggerating impact worst outright lying says save hundreds lives. Closing restaurants going bring deaths zero three straight months? That’s would take save hundreds lives. delusional highly unpopular.  Thankfully, plateauing instead going further. really important point everyone missing. Australia one countries makes extremely difficult citizens leave borders pandemic unless serious emergency reasons (like death family). One friend's parents live Australia second home Taiwan government give permission (to one safe COVID-free havens planet) considered urgent necessary matter.

Anyone left Australia last months head India qualified exit knew could happen knew dangerous Australia felt travel would rise local epidemics like India facing now. I'd also assume buy time government create official process let passport holders/citizens return without potentially bringing back variant could undo Australia's incredible work returning country normal—for example, Taiwan 2 week mandatory quarantine people returning one additional week avoiding public contact foreigners visiting business. Australia needs set special quarantine individuals returning India takes time. Vacations shit know Yes can! said before, India highly effective vaccine (Bharat Biotech) unique researched/developed country itself.

The Serum Institute also contributed research vaccines, India run trials important vaccines. world’s vaccines manufactured India.

India deserves vaccine much Western country you’d instances entire planes people get sick…and doesn’t happen. Texas special vaccine cure. There's difference cure vaccine. said yes help us return normal save lives. I'm getting second shot soon. CVS tool specifically people need 2nd dose.

I got first one Walgreens 2nd CVS. problem, except lady CVS annoyed Walgreens put giant sticker vaccine card barely left room write 2nd dose info lol.

But room vaccine card need booster. good parent would least bother read feed child lmao Many non-western countries Pfizer. Argentina uses Pfizer Chile one best vaccination rollouts world, South American counties using well. Many countries like Iraq, Bahrain, Phillipines, Singapore etc use Pfizer. fact it’s used vaccine world.

The richest sportsperson world Ronaldo Messi took Chinese vaccine offered. Again, seem wrong discussion. 

This discussion reopening willing vaccinated are. Older white male Republican aka 90% crowd Atlanta motor speedway race. Literally what? disagreeing you, back off, dog piling shit post comments, made statement India. - Tests: 1,499,260 - Cases: 47,710 - Deaths: 756 - Currently Hospitalized: 36,499 - Currently ICU: 7,486 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

You’re making sense here. talking getting one dose mRNA happy extra weeks you’re considered “fully vaccinated” mRNA vaccine. it’s latter you’re complaining CDC guidance isn’t right understanding CDC guidance based trials results vaccine manufacturers gave FDA. 

If vaccine manufacturers run new trials one dose mRNA two doses J&amp;J submit guidance may well change. then, understanding recommendations based trials endpoints submitted FDA. No, said person went ER said doctor saw told that. like could tell talked doctor said dont know anyone side effects vaccine. Live California. anyone know I'm able get second shot different vaccine center first? boat here, covid, bad 1st dose, 24 hours aches chills second, totally normal. Dumb question. first time ever heard last vaccine. Correct wrong, successful, mean create vaccines using parts single disease/virus cell? so, goddamn. Yeah mine Wednesday afternoon, Thursday deep body aches 102 temp. completely gone Friday afternoon, though. People aren’t afraid anymore also questioning never ending messaging misadventures CDC. 

get vaccine, live normal life. it’s simple. assume probably similar new zealand, setting specific quarantine facilities arriving india hotspots. like new zealand, need time get everything place without arrivals. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

A good update today numbers almost matching last week! 

J&amp;J starting ramp back 87k reported today (64k yesterday, 42k day before). Hopefully J&amp;J back shift mega-sites micro-sites keep numbers 1m little longer.

Also 65+ crowd sneakly getting pretty damn high. going slow steady. Hopefully see 85%+ point. Pfizer others fill orders get. US ordered 200 million doses pfizer, US gets 200 million. everyone vaccinated... No.  Idiots no, that's meant. really appreciated. took first one got sleepiness week arm pain anywhere else. I'm due second one 5 days. people family I've talked heavy side effects either. think people bad reactions tend vocal experience (understandably so, disrespect) duty little side effects speak well people get entire picture clearly. vaccine catching it? would alert school maybe?

I know really though. Good thing care. one party managed make everything pandemic political issue. that’s case look forward forever Yep people dont understand it.

Ask they'd rather $10,000 end result penny doubles daily 30 days.

Day 1: $0.01

Day 10: $5.12

Day 20: $5,000

Day 30: $5,300,000 makes sad. I've lost 5 people Corona, 1 early 40's left behind 3 kids. blows mind people trying get us attend summer camp school next year when, conversation, say outbreak school daycare. vaccinated roll dice kids. hope people keep getting vaccinated numbers go down. T-cell immunity probably important antibodies, waning antibody titers probably something worry about. Sinovac may worst vaccine have, would end pandemic month could give everyone first doses today. Instead, we're pace give everyone first doses 2023. idea competition needs go. Hopefully everyone get mRNA 1-year 5-year boosters (just based lifetime vaccines work), first doses matters them, are. zero PTO job though WFH. got shot yet due wanting time 1st 2nd shot date fall series days automatically work. next long stretch work (college schedules) run 2 11 July. Working backwards week, arrive around week 7 June. also every Friday Sunday summer. 3-day weekend long enough assuming get shots Thursday evening Friday? tutor mathematics need totally clear mind work. Plus making symptoms nearly bad, 1 fine open society already collectively deal flu thing can't take work for. least force task masters, accept it. LOL, love magical thinking. go experts say absolutely possibility. 

It could evolve less deadly, could easily evolve deadly evade vaccines. 
 
One look complexity HIV see easily evolved work around antivirals.  doesn’t make sense. want vaccine get it. Someone else unvaccinated isn’t going kill you. doubt fully vaccinated people get priority everything. like one-time discounts stores fully vaccinated customers. Nice! 

I agree completely. someone plays ~30 hours video games week filled self loathing, I’m board spicy take.

As long includes TV/movies well course, that’s even passive activity. Right here, bro. avoid addiction coca-cola buying first place use fancy words makes correct Getting vaccinated prevent illness, also limits spread massively (vaccinated people develop enough viral particles spread virus). demographic that? one knows except immediate family, who, none tested, exposed yet keep going care world either. isn’t call ahead anywhere may go let know idea go do, except know plan go school week despite getting last week, huge huge no-no. don’t mind blood drawn, bit. doesn’t make scared anxious. doesn’t hurt doesn’t harm me. I’m lying happens, faint every damn time. imagine would chalked “anxiety”, even though I’m feeling bit embarrassment. sure cheeky joke think oxy habit recent guests? Ok Misclick. approved second :) second this. wife fever felt fine. Two friends got totally laid full day. awesome  agree everything already motion time Biden took office - trying pretend like Biden responsible vaccination campaign whole much pandering saying former president made vaccines happen - logistical, reporting, coordination changes new administration came place. 

There better forward projecting, information sharing states, cold chain optimization (allowing states bid/trade supplies better match capacity) definitely accelerated things bit early days. I'd attribute least 10-20% faster vaccination rate - may sound like lot probably works least couple thousand lives saved.

So happens? population size India lot smaller, exact amount people get covid. population size population size say is. There’s actual border. doesn’t effect covid spreading community all.

Population density makes difference, population size. We're really big like guys there. Here's state (province) doing: slowly receding, adults vaccinated, cases gone way down, things may new normal fall. metric using?
Number doses? 240M.

Vaccines directed original Wuhan strain appear equally effective B.1.1.7. variants seem demonstrate neutralizing antibody escape potentially higher rates break infections post-vaccination.

Question, visited Miami saw morbidly obese people airport i’ve ever seen life Sweden, population hit covid? dangerous mostly age factor? Bharat Biotech inactivated virus vaccine seems work well. besides, look Chile's new cases vs deaths graph, see vaccine lot reduce deaths. definitely helps fight pandemic. Thanks advice. scheduled day tommorow anyway. like said, feel wierd stop.  Alternatively, mainly younger people ending ICU, they'll end staying longer leave less room non-covid patients.

Yeah meant kids (I 13 yo). said 25 bc that’s age read covid statistically becomes dangerous flu. I’m sure 18 yo fear vaccine either...but see worried covid. need learn math bro. there's like 200 kids who've died entire pandemic, we're talking something like 9th 10th highest cause death children. real risk. 100% reasonable parents give shit kid getting COVID like reasonable give shit kid going swimming beach swimming pool.

""Virologists, however, note similar sections appear naturally viruses.""

This disputed paper. incredibly unusual COMBINATION sections, allows SARS-COV2 possess dual action capability, multiplying virulence humans specifically, many many fold.


""However, intelligence sources Britain’s MI5 dismissed idea “rumor conspiracy,” according the Times London""

Solid rebuttal here. comment required.


""senior officials Trump administration have amplified rumors that virus emerged virology lab Wuhan""

Ah yes, token Trump smear. Come David, better that.


""An analysis first 41 Covid-19 patients published medical journal the Lancet found 27 cases, direct exposure Wuhan market, although first known case""

Yes, creates hypothesis zoonotic origin. Now, rest data please? (Albeit black swan situation remaining 14 cases.. link market, earlier cases whatsoever). CCP? Hello? Oh that's information west allowed whole YEAR! requests us plain racist!

I’m pleasantly surprised got bf’s cautious long vaccinated parents able get take masks come inside doubt plenty vaccines available. know last get one dir young age, excellent health job requires limited contact people. even GP. close vaccination Centers won’t even know go shot.

I rush get vaccinated others need urgently, mean want restricted freedoms show solidarity letting others get first. blanket statement referring?  Good you. Others forced however.  far pandemic, level ignorance still exists? Holy shit.  live Ontario.. Doug Ford absolute joke. I’m vaccinated still wearing masks. PCR test says negative, negative. reason recommended follow positive antigen test PCR test.  Italy places too, place year ago impacted virus. practical authority mandate vaccination? would expected Chinese government thought could make work. Fast food open, take out. can't eat inside.  kidding. It’s way higher. Indian tell probably severely underreported ! real number much much higher sure. many conservatives get liberals due choices

I suspect true, simply cities COVID problems suburbs rural areas. previous US regime's plan nothing COVID based premise would hit liberal areas (and politicians) harder. Lol, nothing changes vaccine - society going back pre-pandemic levels freedom. Finally lol, idea. think main question many countries across world. almost every country react late pandemic, thereby losing chance break chain transmission? 

As much one might want talk Chinese suppressing early info virus, put entire province 60 million people hard lockdown Jan 23, varying degrees softer lockdowns entire rest country, essentially self-destructing economy first quarter 2020, response rest world shrug carry before? probably theres statistically people 40 80 Then...sign first dose? thing... Yes, yes are. spike protein *is* antigen. much can.

Well, believe you. know actually confront people obesity irresponsible, quite confident know don't, think anyone does. SHOCKER, that's gigantic issue!

Your actions clearly show believe strong confrontation irresponsible clear disinformation oblige make responsible decisions people communities health, right?

So obesity epidemic continue rage take **hundreds thousands lives** year long COVID rear view mirror.

If consistent held people make choices regard massive toll hospital beds resources take social circle would take kindly that.

I'm sure ok lecturing &amp; ridiculing un-vaccinated idiots though, right?

Take care, good luck next groundhog day argument online issue. calm down, boomer. Massachusetts killing lately. We’re 2nd highest state first injections behind New Hampshire, rate new vaccinations declining less rest country. 
For aggravated long took everyone 16+ qualified, realize must’ve many people higher brackets must’ve getting them. understand sufficient EMA approved vaccines EU within months. sure bullshit stereotype Californians antivaxxers come from. Finally proof it’s true ""Doses vs Cases"" button first dont take vaccine Russia, vaccine Russia take you. Plenty company claim substance already use.

One always better, hardly innovation. true, say ""modern society"". There's theory pandemic late 1800s attributed influenza, might actually coronavirus, eventually became endemic mutated mild illness still exists day (one many ""common colds"").

It's fascinating notion, course we'll never able prove it, since can't test samples back nothing burger then, another headline meant scare people 
Just second shot Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine! difference time two shots 10 weeks; wanted wait couple weeks more, there's scarcity particular vaccine here, wanted get done.

Is test done find amount anti-bodies produced immune system?

P.S.: Thankfully, time around vaccine given side effects, apart sore deltoid. first one basically rekt me. jokes likes you. Time show enough. Sorry able dig raw data news headlines. much can. many obese friends, actually. 

Obesity different topic covid, though. also insidious. breaking patterns changing mindsets towards food, culture struggling do. 

In regards covid vaccinations, situation much dire. One steadily growing years, rapidly devolving new situation. prioritize. switch fixing obesity yet covid situation control polarized.

If vaccination rates shockingly low disinformation spread like virulent middle school rumors, I'd adamant it. keep attempting insult me, that's frankly unnecessary. \#1 Pfizer gave mild head body aches \~18 hours, \~48 hours mild fatigue point took one two naps day. #2 complete non-issue. Go figure... ;) Problem direct flights, often route Dubai countries even hitting local soil.

Or someone might even passenger coming india in, hops third party destinaton infects someone leaves another plane. person infected plane even single clue got afterwards, neither could preliminary scanning prevent get country, route tracing either.

Unless big travel destinations ban flights india way prevent spreading via air travel. expert! common sense. Another way would australian/chinese way fact quite old stems 17th century venice. Send everyone comes outside country strict quarantine regime. regions big enough could work without ""hurting"" many! consistent preach obese individuals actively vigor unvaccinated irresponsible choice making taking resources could used car accident victims, viruses, etc? problem. Good luck family. Thought* [""In 2009 2.8 million hospital stays obesity principal secondary diagnosis, accounting 9% hospital stay.s represents increase 3 percent hospital stays 1996 6 percent stays 2009. wonder much % grown since?

In 2009 9% hospital stays obesity principal secondary diagnosis.

Do raise issue fat friends ensure reduce burden health care system, take beds vital resources struck tragedy outside control?

I'm going take wild guess say talk obese people way would talk vaccinated terms potential burden bare health care system get sick choices. Assuming obese well. doing? Yes, California, example, lowest covid positivity rate last checked. use anti-bacterial spray touch things? way made Pfizer vaccine pretty neat though. Kept choosing stable mRNA something like lol. deal strains Austria (SA B.117) bad news, take long started merge new combined strain arose!

So B.117 pushing SA version long run simply merge! And? much time spending per day infected person indoor space? Show pictures India Brazil. yes? trust Airfinity numbers? I’m asking multiple charts data airfinity posted seemed data either inaccurate data. Sigh... China successful Wuhan surroundings outbreak mostly confined regions thus whole country could provide aid them. big outbreak suppressed Chinese harsh quenching sign outbreak pandemic would take hold China anymore. 

This done countries outbreaks widespread time contrives reacted therefore lockdowns limited success never suppress transmission chains\*. cannot done India outbreak huge widespread shutting country would mean people starve.

(\*few notable exceptions course. Australia NZ example, outbreaks small0 Same.

I read “Kiwi Scientists” thought
 _hmm... scientists specialize specific fruit?_ 
Then read “develop surface coating kills Covid-19”
_why would want kill COVID-19 kiwi skin? supposed eat it?_

_checks comments_

Ahh okay. r/whoosh still address said.

Do issue people take hospital beds lifestyle choices like obesity? believe real, measure taken stop therefore legitimate. Hey I'm getting second shot fifth well! Hopefully die lol microchips bro country good great shape.

That quickly go away. We're hitting wall people want get vaccinated people want go back ""normal"" without taking precautions. MA, USA. parents Delhi. Worried shitless even though vaccinated. I’ve broadly pro lockdown, Jesus Christ, stats really don’t justify response look CovidActNow. many businesses final straw for, prevent 450 hospitalizations governor’s admission? frankly, maybe spike wouldn’t worst thing shame stupid country vaccine skepticism.  ignore global pandemic Oh god, I'm sorry hear relative, hope get ok.

I friend Mumbai (lives Australia now) space 7-14 days lost 5 family 2 closest friends contracted virus. awful situation, India hope keeping safe too.  tested positive covid April 1st, 10 day quarantine, first Pfizer shot 14th. made exhausted. I've got second shot lined 5th. Wish luck boys.  blanket excuse. certain group people, reactions general.  Well hopefully J&amp;J would effective since it’s almost identical Astrazenica no? got yesterday, absolutely kicked ass last night/this morning seems getting better test vaccine claim replicating virus official documentation. whole hubbub whether threshold acceptable. 

Too bad can't watch original conference. think it, right? many people already injected, think safe. Blame whitmer forgetting buy vaccines traveled Florida Thank god lockdowns. 🙄 ⬆️ feel like many practical uses given low fomite transmission is. know lot people refuse take vaccine want see die like “i told guys so.” Gosh man, people dumb. tooo!! mean, I'm sure 100,000,002. Sorry, read article bit ago guess outdated point. Still better nothing. Got mine yesterday really started kicking ass 24 hours, still feeling bad body ache going away Yes. Around 5500. outskirts Delhi aka Gurgaon. One dose pfizer provides protection J&amp;J. 

It really huge deal Pretty sure that’s CDC says still wear masks inside regardless. I’m sure that’s best decision feeling that’s they’re it. old lot, pronounced reactions second dose? Older people may reactions. Myself, wife, parents got almost reaction second shot. sore arm.  ""How many grandmas need die restaurant stay open?"" tagged USA? kindof are... europe would assume much world let travel vaccinated It’s not. It’s INCREDIBLY difficult.  INCREDIBLY.

You’d need properly stored samples patient claiming “prior” infection.  Which, given way testing works...we don’t have.  top that, it’s difficult prove re-infection long infection. Yeah. posted elsewhere:

 That’s exactly bottom Page 67 says — consider “environmental exposure pregnancy .... exposed study intervention (the vaccine) inhalation skin contact.”

Page 67 says nothing getting vaccine another person. explicitly says inhalation skin contact, like opened vial spilled.

Top Page 68 different. talks guy — exposed way — MAYBE capable affecting pregnancy.

This likely due abundance caution comes drug testing pregnant women. government telling keep extra special eye pregnant women. good thing.

I found web. especially like Slide 3 addressing concerns. Pregnant women “special” Three: “Special Populations: Special?” sub anti logic anti science sub reddit ...

Yes, without mods would near top -- anti-vaxxers.

For year, told repeatedly many others saying things actually saying.

The reality ""lockdowns"" would effectively occurred voluntarily anyway. Behavior responds case rate.

The reality long-covid always primary fear.

The reality always huge difference indoor outdoor transmission.

The reality wearing mask helps others helps yourself.

The reality vaccination helps others even low-risk category.

The good news anti logic anti science anti vaxxers hurting far others. Moderna best trials  Yeah honestly idea even needle something else, nurse reposition arm though gave shot maybe that's why? intended government extensions btw central government permitted rules respected single clubs Pariah State  leave observation period 15 minutes up? get card first shot full 15 minutes passed. 

But regardless, call first place got shot tell never got card. *should* record it. record first shot, report local health department hell.

They might recommend getting third shot anyway short time first two, know. Sucks suck   Liquid track needle it’s pulled out. It’s enough reduce efficacy shot though, usually. It’s bit odd got hand though guess needle put direction pulled out? Sucks lmao know one scariests. Coronavirus STDs.

Jokes aside, hope goes well. flip side is, lengths would go **”knew”** people injected cyanide?

Obviously entirely analogous, lot antivaxxers heavily believe vaccines poison right thing taking them. 

I excusing did, it’s horrendous, probably lead least one death line, let’s pretend like people (in general) idiots.

I've seen too, make sense since see cities hit much harder others.

Right you. arms killing today I’m always heard false negatives problem rapids positives pretty much taken gospel. weird. people scourge society. Frankly, need start treating like mental illness, is. Oh god, terrible wear piece fabric mouth leave house compare prison sentence? Lo che anche all'estero si sono comportati male. Però io sinceramente sono stufo di vedere tantissime persone che se ne fregano delle norme e il Governo che perde l'ennesima occasione per fare misure come tracciamento, stroncare il contagio ecc.

PS. Perdona se sono passato all'italiano non riuscivo ad esprimermi inglese. Fdl third, moment main objective reduce viral shedding. Vaccination helps people around you. That's selfish anti-vax.

The second goal reduce severity, happily helps first.

Third prevent infection altogether, course helps two.

Fourth reduce odds dying.

People confuse vaccine treatment. Vaccination statistical. make superman. helps society. year ago people talking 50% effective vaccine would considered great success. wrong. incredibly fortunate high-efficacy vaccines, especially given rate refusal.

I also think quite strong impact perception population, curfew=no virus. Disregarding comments - you’d rather say “oh it’s okay, I’m vaccinated” show card every single person meet instead wearing mask public? Yeah Germany, original schedule us finishing [December would concerning ahead. 

Yeah know; everyone saying ""It's get better! get better!"" several months really. Granted vaccines increased ton past week still absolutely zero clue turn can't leave house night.... I'll believe see it. think biggest cheerleaders people actually EU we're optimistic.

I'm sure, used busses while... see ICUs overwhelmed alcohol drug overdoses first weekend lol Yall go top “nobody wants vaccine” 1 sided arguement, nobody says dont believe it. It’s like argueing pedophiles awesome, veeerry people think that. People dont WANT vaccine, everyone knows works I’m curious mean effectiveness flu vaccine since northern hemisphere usually use Southern Hemisphere see strains prominent guess ones vaccine. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh Sunday asked authorities Yen Bai, Ha Nam Da Nang discipline individuals organizations responsible violations Covid-19 preventative rules.

If strictly hold accountable, people would lack vigilance, leading unpredictable consequences. One person fails exercise vigilance, whole society might suffer,"" Chinh said meeting Covid-19 fighting Sunday morning.

He noted party chiefs chairmen cities provinces responsible situation localities.

Chinh said records showed lot people Da Nang City, Ba Ria-Vung Tau Khanh Hoa Province broken Covid-19 preventative regulations last days. Meanwhile, Dong Thap, Vinh Long Tien Giang provinces slow establishing Covid-19 testing facilities.

""If careless, pay high prices terms human lives, money losses, development opportunities, reputation.""

I'm big Olympics fan point, feel guilty even wanting happen. easy solutions here. matter good solution is, fail people want accept it. way anti-vaxxer think unbelievably stupid. However, think follow logic (or lack thereof) vaccines harmful surely would want stop others harmed? I'm concerned anti-vaxxers shout rooftops dangerous time mock others getting it...shows little know logic humanity. Whos talking hate, talking caution many facets life - voting, drinking, sexual consent, getting driver’s license, enlisting military, etc etc. It’s brain. good one. yes. March **2020.**

what's point? Read article like, care enough even get tested, much less mitigate all? gotta assume refuse vaxxed also aren’t stringent maskers social distancers, they’re probably looking “organic” immunity. April 3, 2020 time testing still sparse. Wuhan Virus.  Thanks! Got second dose yesterday. feeling great today. Tylenol Ok?  India manufacturers already partnerships AZ, Novavax Sputnik-V manufacture vaccines. also vaccine candidate. issue isn’t vaccine candidates. Lifting patents won’t solve problems.

Here's one report details Vietnam able manage COVID. white people authors case trust yellow people fact people like favor bodily autonomy fucking terrifying. one obligated undergo sort medical procedure regardless affect people. use logic anti-abortion crusaders use, saying ""the unborn choice taken away them"" equally bullshit. Bodily autonomy fundamental human rights violate name ""protecting"" view vulnerable never acceptable. Impossible say truly *false* positive not. subsequent negative PCR test prove results antigen test false. totally protected degree virus replication body due vaccinated. may antigen test detected, time got PCR test longer detectable. pretty random near lower detection limits exactly positive negative swabbing obviously quantitative technique amount virus swab vary. follow guidance health department. 💪🇺🇸 Yeah can’t think reasons people color greatly mistrust anything government.

It’s expected get approval month fingers crossed.  community transmission scale established, takes week see kind plateau, yeah.... going take time. Damn, 6-12 hours bad all. Thanks info  although generic terrorism vaccine motivated. Cite sources. Otherwise you’re saying bullshit. prioritisation ended June May (might depending Bundesland). Therefore, young age excellent health going road block. Whether vaccination centers remain open depends Bundesland. guess going keep open populous places (Saxony recently decided keep open 3 biggest cities example).

It's never bad idea GP. case that's major problem you, call 116117 KBV (Kassenärztlicher Bundesverband) find appointment you.  one hundred percent irrational anxious vaccines available US right now. rate incidents low compared doses adminisitered trial phase 2023 thats enough source know shouldnt taken.  many people think might uncomfortable don’t say anything anyway? Silence ≠ acceptance.

But fact you’ve openly admitted vaccinated **and** intentionally aware wearing mask completely incorrectly around people work means you’re piece shit, surprises there. actually analogy use describe trust science/medicine certain degree (because super difficult wrap head around/I always research I'm medical professional).

Imagine building house. Typically might need carpenter, electrician, plumber, engineer, people(I know goes building house fully). trust people (for part) specialize good worry much somebody something wrong.

Now imagine building house, except time landscaper plumbing. Yeah might SUPER basic basis knowledge do, going make mistakes possibly completely misunderstand doing/they might wrong.

Now let's add third layer. Let's people work company. Youve heard great things company sense trust them. come work house, seem like job. mean supposed able build good houses right? Well closer inspection, notice landscaper completely lost assigned work plumbing. notice problems like nobody wearing proper safety gear people jobs trained/learned do. 

Now, normally would something get different company actually know realize contract signed blocks give rave reviews hear out.

I may use shortened versij conversation difficult track real time. But, end, house company really matter. people work house important. might know stuff one area constitution, might almost compleatly blind another.

To knowledge, somewhat science/medicine. surgeon might BEST surgeon world, go advice treat child's cancer, probably know best practices, treatments, causes all. instead go somebody specializes treating childhood cancer.

You go landscaper set plumbing house, go surgeon diagnose childhood cancer. title supposed be: **""Italian police arrest two terrorists fire bombing vaccination hub""** Please, elaborate ""We always war Eastasia.""

The universe exists outside experience. Trauma happens childhood sticks people whole lives. Propaganda always exist blind spots, things want think deeply about, questions avoid asking yourself; reinforced take granted? kind everyone receives different. Assuming say ""There propaganda around soda"" kind universal truth it, self centered.   hand, social safety net times high unemployment depressed economy exactly gov't doing.

I actually think correct response. world changed virus government enabling people pretend old world coming back expense much slower transition new world. basically worst thing long term even though get away temporary measure. want spend, way prepares people new world. Medical training, construction new hospitals, production medical supplies, onshoring essential products reduced globalization.

1 child millions entire province. moved cause death people last place cause death list children. Congrats. ""technically correct"" sense possible kids die virus. like possible die moose stop saying killing children since know is. 

Because disingenuous. ""killing children"" significant way. dangerous go fucking playground monkey bars swim pool. negligible risk outrageous would fucking argue something even Viruses different. explosive exponential growth become deadlier time. 

No. Endemic viruses literally can't controlled, become less deadly time generally mutate toward infectiveness less lethality increases ability reproduce. Also people build immunity viruses time encounter more.

 agree people exaggerate risk due children.  downplaying risk acceptable either.

Funny, said 1 million, downplaying it. That's actually likely child die virus. exaggerating risk even though pretending make likely people take disease like measles polio seriously, viruses absolutely target children much greater risk injury death. 

This fucking polio. going next, bring AIDS? fucking virus kill kids. That's it. Stop pretending something actually countries (namely ones took COVID-19 seriously) pediatric deaths. 

This irrelevant. virus endemic. can't pretend like avoidable countries took containment policy. fact life come contact it.

Stop treating country monolithic entity one person represents it.   Good hope goes well! want return pre covid life.  Hell fascinating. Netherlands many different dialects.
But dont think self respecting scientist would want live people. No, way improve mental health stop spread people see good news.

These people treating symptom instead curing disease.  OP wrong. lockdown since Oct 10 - things far open right now.

Our ICU 100% previous peak fyi. could 99% vaccine people continue fixate small population hold outs

Lol no. People get MMR shots kids get talked about, one's ""fixated"" them.

If 99% US population vaccinated, would barely even think COVID domestically. Turkey this? think that's useful line reasoning. mRNA vaccines unsuccessful fail *unsafe*, unsuccessful due lack efficacy. work disease supposed help defeat.

But even though people went trials get desired protection disease, also end getting sort side effect (blood clotting disorder, nervous system issues, growing third arm, etc) people seem worried about. Canada's peak far 360k day, capacity far more.

I dunno upvoted. absolutely stupid. first shot yet, wit second shot going WAY shorter 4 months.

Chile's cases still high 9% peak. trend seems slightly downward, early days.

Only 10% vaccinated people Chile received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That's available capital big cities. goes elites.

The rest get China-made vaccines. They're great. WSJ covered back story authorities released results study 10.5 million people, showing vaccine 16% effective infection one dose 67% effective second dose. study also found 80% effective preventing death Covid-19 two weeks second dose. need start making cardboard cutouts  I'm sorry hear that.

SinoVac's Numbers higher think. 67% Chile, 83.5% Turkey, 50.7% Brazil (among healthcare providers). Afaik, vaccine trial purely within healthcare providers frontline.

AstraZeneca 70-76%. 4 approved vaccines China, want harp worst one Sinovac, go right ahead.  many times posted? Thanks! pfizer good know this! Well, assumed countries need would start taking priority. Obesity leads severe (insert condition) That’s impressive could get sick 5 times last year. last year first time sick all.   okay Joe Rogan said don’t need vaccinated. Last heard moderna pfizer, first dose gets ~65% chance avoiding hospitalization, getting doses gives ~95% avoiding hospitalization. 

None vaccines make immune. spike protein cause damage, spike protein vaccine body create causing damage well? it, much milder extent?  tell (northeast) state, hardly restaurants actually listening capacity restrictions   Things control sure due vaccines, well bit generous. We've gotten used high case loads long things seem great relative basis. 

We *should* better - example, UK country pretty similar US terms demographics vaccine access. They're 25 cases per 100K per week. US still 115 cases per week (and that's fewer tests per capita). 

Deaths lag cases, we're still clearing morbid backlog long haulers ICUs/critical care winter spike, 1 10 deaths recorded US daily COVID. country widescale access vaccines, that's disappointing statistic. UK vaccinated something like 94% 50s; US putzing along bit 60% 50. Fingers crossed guys! would it? Vaccine may help much measures taken. basically takes much time vaccinate billion people. That’s happened. Whitmer, Democratic Governor, wanted things reopened fired health director opposing recklessness. replaced Whitmer do-nothing functionary, followed lead threw doors open everything.

Working data known bad isn’t useful anyone. Try tripling deaths per million India, minimum.  Current vaccines showing pretty great protection even perfect original. makes sense:

A: nations world, including hate other, USA, Russia, China, Europe, UK, India, Brazil etc.. joining together launch grand conspiracy knock trillions global trade, kill millions, damage health hundreds millions more. somehow someone like Trump accidentally spilling secret hooker mid spanking. Or...

B: virus behaving like virus. Vaccinations slow still sporadic lockdowns cases escape quarantine.

That's dumb take, risk getting covid gym fully vaccinated practically zero, still live life like normal getting vaccine really see point getting all. Framing ""Not potentially dying public gym"" person fully vaccinated equally absurd. Ok maybe said 'seem peaked'. Anyway, quite strong reaction compared states. need asymptomatic people test accurate numbers. recognize challenge getting asymptomatic people test voluntary basis, gets harder stop requiring people test return school work test returning travel. nah bro, oppose safety measures make businesses operate reduced revenue. absolutely love safety measures keep safe. end day selfishness, thats consistency. want keep profits flowing keep heart beating know 7 people COVID, none hospitalized 2 completely commission like month serious side effects months later. coughing pink residue (pieces lungs) trouble sleeping all. 2 others sense taste still. 

Hospitalizations death aren’t everything Lockdowns work though right? Mask wearing works though right? really. argument nothing supply. simply matter wanting inject body foreign substance. committed staying away risky scenarios, right. allowing nuance discussion absolutely harms credibility pro-vaccination movement. give sense priorities lie this, absolutely CDC guideline fully vaccinated individuals unmask outside. Unvaccinated people absolutely going taking advantage this, many wearing masks outside throughout whole pandemic. need encouraging masks distancing, even among vaccinated, much possible.

And even emergency forces out, go back quarantine. going become infectious day infected. also assuming lot scenario.

If certain people want get vaccinated that's fault. start living life normally again. That's argument could say literally anything. I'm sure flat earthers' objectively smarter random person care name. natural result lot them.

If folks cared mental health, they'd demanding zero covid strategy. Steel beams melt 😜  Late July realistic scenario folks without priorisation. Germany needs another 100 mln doses inoculate everyone. Considering everyone willing vaccinated, number decreasing substantially. Germany receive 5.5 mln doses per week may least 6 mln doses June. That's 52 mln without considering deliverys AstraZeneca mid may J&amp;J general. real number might around 60-70 mln end June.

Basically everyone truly willing inoculated going first shot end June second one depending mandatory waiting time shots (sans J&amp;J). Update saga. rapid antigen test come back positive exposed work, despite fully vaccinated. symptoms. health department requested get PCR done came back. Negative. 

I’m waiting health department call back obviously whatever say, pretty safe say false positive I’ll cleared around people again? would love see partner, lmao. 

Also, common rapid false positives happen? I’m finding much google. change new administration.

You're deluding yourself.

Trump Biden's pandemic response nearly identical.  people want get vaccinated... CDC ignoring risks order justify risky behavior. training expertise properly process interpret data...you graduated engineering school like 12 months ago... 
Whatever tbh. overconfident limits knowledge uncommon someone school. 55...like Lock throw away key. vaccinate first. LOL that's keep telling people lmao Guess political party mostly voted by... Also super expensive live here.

Sounds like advocating solution let people get infected herd immunity achieved. We'll agree disagree. comment based people judging people look like Koreans; ie something isn’t choice. judging people immigrants, judging people look like. Someone looks Korean 1. May Korean 2. May immigrant 3. May think thing extremists. would make sense make leaps think extremists simply based look.

However, anyone beliefs (or beliefs) judged based beliefs. might think extremists good based actions, decisions, beliefs. Similarly, me, religion indicates lack intelligence, reasoning, critical thinking, simply based belief held/decisions made hold beliefs, actually inherent factors person Ecstatic, even. Pretty sure replyimg purely political post above. Sorry u dont agree. course lol, I’m even specifically talking religious extremists. don’t blame Muslims ISIS, however blame Muslims consequences Islamic doctrine, I.e. women covering freedom movement.

Also think you’re defensively reflexive good reason, lot people talk online probably say crazy shit like exterminate all. don’t think all, religions shouldn’t protected class like things are, that’s all. Kettle Black, China.  Asia South America ones fueling wave worldwide. need help them. send stuff! city, we're even done group 2 yet there's word bulk group 3 eligible. go 116117 vaccine website check availability, can't says appointments way two weeks. 

A little birdy said group 3 would eligible May 6th that's really case, state government said something now? see vaccines open everyone June wait mid/late May open group 3. It’s natural non-dense states don’t see huge beneficial impact lockdown situations denser ones do, believe that’s case correctly conducting risk assessment something can’t see.

Remember people thinking, oh, urban disease, don’t fear rural areas?

Consider fact rural areas, medical resources scarce. takes much less area gets overwhelmed compared urban area. may see immediate benefit lockdown daily life, know underlying health care system really benefits thing. general, rural health care system gets overwhelmed, quickly, beyond screwed compared urban area.

Figure 2 Figure 3 show similar patterns R factor virus regardless state. That’s expected, virus doesn’t care living situation is. Take account people lax rural areas yeah, numbers make sense.  feel sorry you, misfortune type mother father raised constantly speak foul language rudeness. I'm glad people encounter, especially Asia, decent mothers well-spoken.  

You're taunting people COVID badly hit country, 639 deaths per million, yet call others dumb. That's one oddest things pandemic, seeing Canadians boast tragically high death toll. number homeland high too, see tragedy brag. fact number currently lower USA's make us feel better tragedy. Even South Korea, 39 deaths per million, disappointed tragedy. Nobody boasting. people Korean, Canadian. Random people die every day. one know gotten died know fact I’ve never got tested. back I’m also asthmatic I’m sure I’d know got Covid problematic country be, week I've realized I'm damn lucky living United States. We're potentially rounding corner pandemic good vaccinations increasing good pace. fucking medical intervention. would take vaccine time forcing experimental (yes experimental year since got two non experimental) vaccine onto others gonna get us anywhere. Im saying agree people getting covid vaccine (who getting covid vaccine covid vaccine vaccines tested upgraded course couple years 100% safe) understand thought process people. felt fairly bad flu like symptoms middle night got shot went away mostly midday next day. I’d say 6-12 hours feeling crappy. Hate capitalism. America. piss poor leadership managed come end thanks money alone. I’ve never single person ask mention mask beneath nose mouth work. live conservative area aren’t usually literal sounds really hard. Hopefully comes around soon!
