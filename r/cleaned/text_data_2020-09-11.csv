0,2020-09-11," Sinovac ccp company, poor people probably sing song getting CZ = Connecticuz horrible Uhh...pretty poor reply. I'm talking mask regulations mention flight next week recommendation to...lose weight take vitamins? Pretending Covid-19 gone. Ignoring make go away. get keep liver, start losses Chinese Mutations go way too, unfortunately. One woman infected least 54, shall do? 
Bars work till 10 pm 6 days.

Mankind chance virus. Reading comments sub done damage heart coronavirus ever could. first vaccines likely less effective flu vaccines now.

On top C19 3x contagious flu roughly. 

Its comparable. first wave vaccines downgrade flu scenario right away. take time. CZ country? Uk surge cases Haha Florida higher better? Florida Goal become #1 ? Well said. It‚Äôs sad human rights trivialized pandemic. can‚Äôt safety. balance. clickbaity title. Idk somewhere turned making sure hospitals don‚Äôt get overwhelmed wait vaccine wait every take vaccine eliminate complelty.

It‚Äôs crazy. never forget night met girl who, excitedly, told friends wanted us watch ""A Serbian Film"". one particularly shocking scene (I'm guessing know movie) said, smiling insanely apparently finally proven point, ""THIS Serbian government people!""

Probably quite but, imagine. (Anyone reading know movie? Look up.)

Surprised told N95s, know distinctively American thing doing. seemed like countries first got hit (before got US, paying attention happening Europe Asia.)

I'll never forget video next door neighbor Putin going hospital straight hazmat suit. Psh, give healthcare workers. Quebec City karaoke party one night started second wave, joke, went 2 cases per day 30-40 cases per day. Crazy goes fast Meanwhile India:- *haha cases go brr* could wrong, pretty sure wisconsin restrictions couple months now. Lol you‚Äôre critical China comments, CCP Bots downvote oblivion hide comment. suprise. never rhink opening?ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è average things see Reddit lmao. Sympathy? who‚Äôs she? No...

Just wait enough people immunity vaccination infection R0 drops one cases drop off. 

The first vaccines partially effective. may even prevent retransmission well prevent severe disease. definitely point cases start drop. It‚Äôs cop Ohio **in video wearing mask**. 100% walked right back place work infected others. fucking get shit. vigilance increasing experience increases. accidentally forgetting stay 6 ft away. forgetting wash hands touch questionable surface. I've found mask fits perfectly going 5 others. I've gotten proficient using remote services. learned cook every meal always ate out/had takeout. I've developed new hobbies routines pandemic friendly... fucking get it. getting easier... harder. really rough first, new normal. Hell I'm used wearing mask point practically feel exposed without one. I'll probably keep wearing even covid goes away. Thousands Americans got positive COVID-19 tests due false president. loss Ah, that's keep everyone out. unwinnable scenario. Kobayashi Maru Gen Z running colleges? greed older people. Maybe don‚Äôt trust judgement wondering said would disabled life. I‚Äôm genuinely wondering since haven‚Äôt heard myself. meters apart. Wear mask. Wash hands frequently. kind.

This alll ruined school Their* vaccine 99% effective. 

MMR 98% Lol, like Chinese first place. OK settle down. lot effective treatments past months help infected survive Covid. take lots Vitamin Zinc, you‚Äôre good spot. Availability teaching jobs really varies province province. Way jobs BC compared Ontario. can‚Äôt speak provinces. lucky first wave vaccines 50% effective. 

They may prevent severe disease retransmission depending vaccine. Canada pretty bad hardass college degrees though. specialty background company wanted move do...govt said ‚Äúlol no, degree‚Äù.

I love Canada wish could lived there. lot degrees don‚Äôt mean shit visas. wouldn't? worked it. can't believe read naive comments like ""if getting vaccine, wearing mask"". 

This bargain humans virus. Virus negotiate rewards nice social distancing. 

I honestly believe nature stop spread. made lab, brilliantly thought through. 

You virus spreads asymptomatically, lot mild cases move stealth mode. 8/10 like that, social distance week, symptoms, meet one person, 5 weeks that, end 1 case keeping virus alive without detection period long enough one believes still. viruses hide animals, one hides people, way easier since relly social distancing social creatures.

If wear mask time, still need others wear it, rellies human cohesion, historically speaking, happened never before.

It spears kids, super spreaders technically, much higher viral load. 

It spears animals.

It kills old sick, also fat. remember ever read virus kills fat people more. obesity pandemic, driven many factors, somehow sounds sinister me.

Higher CFR peple white. also never heard vitamin influence virus affect you. 

Higher CFR poor due jobs survive, lack proper life basically (poor diet, obesity, underlying conditions, lack medical care).

I see polititians scared themselves. see Trump 2 different delegations, without mask. 

We live credit shit, rich don't. told ""economy would collapse"", truth much money much dept yes, can't stop working take food home. Inequality ""they more"". everything added value sit home fckn month, dragons sit billions. 

I doctor, someone ever believed conspiracy theory, sceptical always check everything read. morning coffee thoughts, would love hear opinion. 0 x 10 = 1000 150 schools Netherlands atm Um, can't declare away. would mean, things equal, 1/10 deaths.

We far less 1/10 deaths. 1/20, last checked. Hey, first, last. feel like Canada little ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù right now. Thanks welcome. :) combination things me: wanting grow old country functioning healthcare system; mass shootings; way response Hurricane Maria absolutely botched (figured next disaster could even worse); Latino migrant kids kept concentration camps...

I know Canada perfect, so, soooo much better. Happy here. :) Whomever charge state county seems determining factor places reopening. bad trend there's deaths???? Stop looking cases look hospitalization deaths.  Exactly. think that‚Äôs fetish protest  Pointing Hindu nationalist office racist all. see race this?

pointing oppression Indian Kashmiri Muslims racist?  know issue state daycare owners making staff wear masks requirement saying lack cases proof good job. lot amount cases state recently likely one spread, magically better avoiding transmission.

I support national, state, local mask mandates majority population vaccinated vaccine effective enough create herd immunity. US said accept vaccines 50% effective yet know duration immunity time tell good are, fast make enough vaccine(s) get everyone medical exemption vaccinated. people don‚Äôt understand blows mind. I‚Äôm 63 don‚Äôt want young people stop living me. all. Hell, I‚Äôm ready stop living either!  thought quarantining US folks arrival. Since day 1, school basically went ""maybe know"" theory resent letters/voicemails masks mandatory. students wearing masks getting spit on, absolutely happy making known. bullying, like ""you're important us, wear mask! sibling home!"" (or whatever else). small school, shit like fly radar well.

Yeah hands full, lively even sick. enjoy constantly arguing amongst teens, two could try patience Job disagree.

We're hoping fully recovered days, minimal damage. sure baby yet, due new. We're monitoring breathing, mucus, fevers sure. monitor check stats (blood pressure, temps, etc) every hour. definitely returning long time, we're worried turning serious issues/death.

Here's hoping passes house real fast school/vaccine stuff happens. get flu shots? chances like way way way lower getting current situation?   Really though. I‚Äôm willing admit intuition would said good idea, months in, amusement parks open many states without real issue. suspect would seen many major outbreaks, like colleges seeing, we‚Äôre case. Sometimes we‚Äôre gonna get things wrong need update beliefs based actually happening. Refusing almost bad anti-maskers. company hiring lol.. Asking Mechanical engineering graduate ""friend"" Worse pandemic human history? serious like THAAAAAAT serious. Fuck lol. Agree, husband sounds like twat Yes unfortunately family, 10 suburbs got locked 30th June, 2 weeks later rest Victoria. Masks became mandatory, curfew 8pm-5am. allowed 1 hour per day exercise. essential shops open like supermarket, medical etc. home visits, seeing friends etc. next step lockdown planned 26th October less daily average 5 fewer cases 14 days, even businesses open, curfew probably stay &amp; may see people. Realistically govt plan won‚Äôt really start opening 0 cases 14 days!! probably won‚Äôt economy open back hey beaten COVID! Welcome Canada, happy you. get Americans know good ones, sane ones recognize issues plaguing America. actually think great enjoy greatness Hopefully works well ya know shit fucking sucks right huh maybe won‚Äôt suck guy. difficult. Imma let go first. I‚Äôll wear mask little longer. Watch wait side effects kick rushed vaccine I‚Äôll also say people come privileged teenagers live white collar parents expect shit free. subscribe idea government fund lives. Bleh. Yeah shit. first break I've years without kids bringing home interesting virus school monthly. course they're going give us COVID. Kids gross. wait.... yesterday first day school Due mutation, still see much weakens time. That's tell every time. Yep. I'm ATX. Looking forward impact 25,000 person audience football game we're tomorrow. many things protest over. I'm holding sign getting shot police either going BLM police reform possibly protest results election end going full-Belarus. really worry turn out. Revolutions always work better. color revolutions started great, ended badly.

I try recommend state initiatives people, states allow initiatives brought public vote. think going start getting everyone talk important thing is. School reopen week ago shit show. Children 11 masks pointless then, entire schools get closed confirmed case. Middle highschool masks distancing class lunch next impossible.. 

All all, situation still control summer vacations return people offices, bound cases. Also testing much more. 

I would say managing moderately well considering many constricts are. slowly losing ground bound local quarantine again.

However, comparing occupation done online home versus one cannot.

See comment^ discussed. gonna take get everyone too. say it‚Äôs open minded local coronavirus sub. People talking trick treating high risk. Like come on. anyone know assess risk? exactly? I'm genuinely curious. banana republic authoritarian regime? Brazil? Russia? Canada fairly socialist pretty heavy gun control. /r/TechnicallyTheTruth Welcome Reddit Seriously.

Yes, eat sauerkraut currywurst every day breakfast, lunch dinner glass beer wearing lederhosen singing German anthem.

Germany South Korea best testing tracking&amp;tracing capacity world, people countries generally compliant (strict) rules, results lower number infections. sauerkraut Exactly! feel infected? might infected, starting fever coughing, cant distinguish flue ...have heard Uyghur holocaust going china? absolutely ok like China.  conservative prime minister Canada particularly attractive Republicans either. schools reopening also felt next week's numbers. Enlighten me, please. Hmmm, means Ad5-nCoV going phase 3 trial Russia Pakistan. *looking Chinese bet know lot you, that's sure. Shit man, enter bar looking anywhere world, looking Chinese saying that. Really, would get lot people angry even racist, am, would easily flip start saying support ccp.

It months now, admit North Korean methods lockdown effective wrong along United States Way better, averaging 40,000 new cases day &amp; 1,000 deaths. One might say rounding corner complete disappearance infections altogether. Canadians really look like you‚Äôre trouble. mean us Americans, got one time 1,200 payment months shut businesses permanently closing, got what? 2,000 several months, actual stimulus plan help citizens ? guys applying American citizenship soon ? ü§™ hell ""influencer?"" 1/10 braincells Hello Doctor thank reply. 0.3% x 100 0.3% x 200. calculator seem work tonight, thank advance. I'm guessing they're trying smart state since they're positive 0 issue together. They're issue probably 0 due diligence actually see individual tested covid. Kick out. fought goose once. 

We driving along. know bad day maybe next thing ya know side road shirts off. know goes. think talking technicalities law still? I've even seen Merkel's speeches coronavirus sets tone, praises workers good work, explains exponential growth, on. That's bulk leaders do. leader giving speech topic exercising authority.

Maybe hard see affects pandemic response Germany EU, imagine chancellor denying need action, belittling masks restrictions, different state response. I‚Äôm hotspot Alabama mom tested positive pretty sure also infected. Yes important closing borders, immediately implemented significant testing tracing capability. Great healthcare system, people compliant rules, obligatory mask wearing store, massive testing capacity. Also helps Germans general respect personal space anyway, even outside pandemic. I've lived Germany Italy difference people pretty interesting see Really? disagrace. Looks like American brainwashing bullshit spreading like wildfire. Explain CCP 91 million Chinese, get full bus China would expect handful CCP members.

Trying separate CCP Chinese people futile attempt, Chinese people quite aware people use ""I hate CCP Chinese"" get jail free card anti-Chinese racism. see... sad ultra right everywhere. hate extreme sides, nowaday especially Trump, ultra right stick thorn side. able taste food. Kinda sucks. US coming behind now. bad think countries must hit fall back behind US again? people never admit wrong really care are, either. *Shhhh. remind them.* 

They're gonna search OP's giant purse hear you. easy fitting here. want impact valuable organs now. death glare every time touch me. :/ nothing makes feel better Sorry disappoint you, seem take ideas stupid sea people, many wearing masks, turned Aotea Square around midday held signs protesting Covid-19 lockdown, 5G, vaccines, New Zealand government TPPA.

No masks + 5G + anti-vaxxer.

Look South Koreans protesting see demonstrators, many wearing masks carrying South Korean flag, paraded rain near Seoul's presidential palace, calling President Moon step see policy failures, kowtowing nuclear-armed North Korea election corruption.

English-speaking countries vulnerable Americans become mad. that's ticking Canada - much slower infection rates, definitely going up. Misleading title. Risk implies element chance. happen 100% certain. Cases increase people's lives ruined lost. Luckily take IQ 160 understand cases MUCH higher April. since testing mainly focused sick people hospitals, cases appeared level now. Much higher cases meant many deaths. observed. lockdown put place flatten curve thus reduce strain hospitals. appears huge number cases equal April,however, know much testing going includes asymptomatic people. cases asymptomatic low number covid cases ICUs moment France, coupled IFR 0.3%, need another lockdown. honestly know dumb you. Yeah, seem like would get good rhetoric cultural central value. loud, talking fast, bit outrageous somehow ""owning"" ‚ÄúI think 3.4 percent \[fatality rate\] really false number.‚Äù - Trump region (very low population), event made infection numbers rise critical limit, taken ""precautions"". 

Bars restaurants closed 22 parties limited 50 people (can't enforce this). virus absolutely zero chance spread further. hopelessly look holes hide in. Actually, measures draconian, R value region dropped 0.00001 immediately. Let's call is: given trouble week Oxford's vaccine western world realises there's probable chance China first proven vaccine. thus feel need shit stir again. think follows philosophy distancing effective masks masks give false sense security. also feel wants avoid things like thousands marching street montreal defiance masks...

Not sure agree it, getting point feel like mask mandate far off. enjoy family gatherings I‚Äôll pass year. mine others‚Äô safety. Yes, much hostility towards CCP world. Chinese, ccp Chinese. They're grounding Boeing 777s, entire fleet title suggests. yeeeep that's pretty much sub lol. want sit back petty authoritarians feel morally superior get government UBI actually get work. think Taiananmen square, Mongolia, HK Taiwan? nothing personal freedom, lack personal power security. They're afraid people there. (X) Doubt Yes, that's right. Although given I've seen west I'm considering moving back China. didn‚Äôt even get memo confederacy ended 150 years ago relate cutting people off. think I‚Äôm crazy wearing mask want versus forced to. Snip snip say. things miss? really big difference equipment Germany Netherlands, amount equipment, really relevant since number IC admissions low countries.

In Netherlands they're also discouraging people without symptoms te test test locations busy people can't get tested 48 hours. Dutch petson Germany lot, lack masks NL infuriating. feel much safer German supermarkets, also starting reflect daily infections since we're heading 1000+ per day Germany 1500-200 per day, Germany 4-5 times inhabitants stores requiring masks tho - although again, really enforced (nor minimum wage workers expected enforce it). Next time I'd leave food walk out. place puts folks like get business. decide fact. Plenty restaurants around take out. make sure quarantine 2 weeks, lot assholes dont that's leads shit. need Google ask stupid question. already know answer ignorance.  yet, also country government willing destroy economy save people, reward GDP increasing unlike every country around world.

Can say say, US? BC went low 4 cases day 140 yesterday due reopening.

I'm going guess idiot 20-40 year olds driving infection rates I'd expect spike soon since guys 1-1.5 month behind us reopening. Cheaper retirement home Wall street Economy. consumers buy stuff go places going bad time. Oh, even better, so, Chinese loves CCP, living outside China? sure call comrade great firewall sucks. Still make posts less stupid. Yeah, I'm remove shade cloth garden northeast Valley foothills. There's plenty shade coming air. :( 

There book written 80's called Thirst, vampire king uses dark magic call sandstorm onto Los Angeles, blotting sun vampire army take city. really felt like last couple days. It‚Äôs literally island hahaha still essential always believe everyone see virus, takes couple people area dropping guard around one person bam 100 new cases week anyone knows balloon 1000. area pretty good masks still solid 70% without downtown adverse reaction due vaccine, wasn't. 


That's point. statement adds absolutely nothing useful discussion. mean clearly one two possibilities. point even writing it? Perhaps I'm China? Source excess deaths turning negative USA? moreso CDC completely updated databases recent weeks? (takes time process deaths etc) Maybe beginning could say things like flatten curve(of hospitalisations deaths, cases untrustworthy since find minor amounts virus even dead virus). flat UK know existing immunity coronaviruses. T-cells. estimated 50√∑ population kills virus take hold. Build existing resistance. unfair focus disease. Note delayed healthcare hospitals made room cancelled appointments covid patients never came people scared go news, delayed cancer diagnosis killing covid would. cost going astronomical accounted for. estimates Sturgis rally's impacts suggested paying person something like $13k attend would less economic hit. Agreed. 

Historically, CDC best: analyze infectious disease illness outbreak started spread.

Studies like time- labor-intensive. Since beginning AIDS crisis, cut funding CDC again. can‚Äôt 30 years expect rise occasion perform intended.  Yeah, Reddit US site primarily US population, obviously discussions going US-centric. surprising? could also said ‚ÄúWooowww, took 2 comments make Canada‚Äù really, what‚Äôs point?  tin foil hat person, sure would believe given recent history. previous post? live South Korea lol things looking normal. Alright, would like California BAN out-of- state travelers Nebraska pandemic ends.

Ya'll downvote now. Let guess Texas? gets four years he'll get four years  show completely bought propaganda Hah, never realized outcast living central Quebec. Pretty wild think Better random gibberish currently spewing office *cries american* Fall: hold beer Swede here. I'd say swedes general huge trust official authorities way assume common states (that good bad, crisis I'd say good thing). course political discussions controversy well overall I'd say we're fairly collaborative. mentioned earlier we're playing long game Plandemick wear masks stay home. great. masks apparently reduce symptoms intensity thing Right? It‚Äôs almost surreal NS cases (as far experience) pretty good general public mask use. It‚Äôs tough watch news see numbers every day. 4 children school exception youngest , everyone wearing masks. tell 7 year old stay prepared case start spread again. 

It‚Äôs difficult, wear mask public spaces, wash hands, avoid large gatherings limit recreational travel. sucks it‚Äôs better minor inconvenience apocalyptic plague. virus never gone. Waves defined growth, lingering around I‚Äôm Canadian went Europe last month. can‚Äôt speak anyone else, concerns trip therapeutic experience. world reason like us now. seems work US army, partner is. article mentions lives army base.
I think control military personnel arrivals. point food imports one really thought of, Chunnel closed? That's used passengers (I.e. freight) it? Czech Republic still official name. Czechia short-form version 15k tests day, friday 1450... guess monday 2k. really good numbers all...

Not would terrified covid point universal mandatory facemasks everywhere certainity next days another lockdown real possibility... life started look normal again. Almost everywhere low population density well. mean, area Quebec population around 20000 far 5 confirmed cases. Really, anyone doubt knew along? gets ***briefings***.

Article Swedish, could't get load google translate, translated first part. results come back next week study ends Sunday take days get results back.

Hell, we‚Äôve nearly doubled many people travel regularly world since SARS **2003**. bullshit mentality. Fuck you. Much population density, also think big factor health care systems.

In Canada go hospital risk bankruptcy, people truly need help getting care timely manner thus potentially increasing odds recovery. Well yes depending stats looked at. depending data use support argument paint picture. example think fatality rate us good way us far far better Canada. handled response proper Healthcare self care much better Canada. 

But looked death rate raw numbers course see people dead us. US also 10x amount people also us done around 88 million tests Canada done 5.5 million.

So us tested near 1/3rd population Canada still far behind tests population ratio. Thank you; that‚Äôs great quote. Even final line: ‚ÄúNo feeling final.‚Äù Yup. love university. may everything right, get scholarship, get pay in-state tuition, give LOTS scholarships. Man, sounds miserable. understand cautious also don‚Äôt need lock home. wear mask everywhere go, wash hands constantly throughout day, stay 6ft away people bubble, also still live life. play golf, go friend‚Äôs house, take vacations cottage. life doesn‚Äôt need home. Think things. 

Ottawa, Canada Trump vaccine coming soon.
1.part bleach
1 part Trump Vodka
1 part Trump Water
1 part Trump Wine (yes real)
96 parts bullshit

It incredibly, bigly better vaccines ‚Äòwork home can‚Äô strategy never abandoned.
As soon government like ‚Äòreturn office can‚Äô knew company would get back far we‚Äôve least 4 people sick requiring Covid tests one can‚Äôt get hold test poorly accounts.

‚ÄòCovid secure‚Äô office means stick couple hand sanitizers around hope best. Per usual headline misleading... talks one year ""vaccine usage"". Several vaccines ""arrived"" ""being used"" tests right now. headline makes sound like start point available general public, knows be. Yes - going feel amazing... hell ride 162b3. paragraph based nothing. sources besides 'heard'. COVID runs course, contagious. achieve herd immunity. fuck gonna let economy tank even continuing tell people stay inside shop online? 

Main street wiped this, STILL approved new stimulus bill! going pushed far back election possible, Americans getting bent fucked every God damn hole. point, I'm ready say fuck fine health insisting nothing staying inside spreading narrative. 

It's time get back work. Restaurants small businesses gonna looking help. suggest pick towel, bus boy. saves one life..... Live theatre. stage. country that? weaker position countries locked early virus (like Central Europe), populations around world becoming angry restrictions less likely comply. restrictions lighter begin with, damaged economy less, would room keep enforcing them, maybe even imposing lockdown hospitals close overwhelmed. Right one suggesting another lockdown, herd immunity lot countries, means potential rapid spread.

Treatment techniques improve death rate slightly significantly, probably counter balanced fact stopping surgeries, cancer screening etc. also many deaths. Compared trillions destroyed world economy justification lockdowns would colossal waste money. trillions could reformed entire health services, saving millions lives long run. world needs block US tourists. Black Plague bacterial. Fuck me, people scared life here. wearing mask pandemic? would social distance wear mask vaccinated therefore minimize risk approx 80% reduce severity lot. Cup balls. *Czechs still give fuck* Less 200k deaths.. sorry bust bubble. first signatories

Entirity Europe seeing violence ambulance, Police firemen. going corona well. People keep going flu season bad covid flu. think that's case think flu nothing coronavirus get way worse Thanks sympathetic comment. Here's deal. learned Jan 1 Feb 15 INSANE. 85% know. six+ months since barely scratched confirmed seemed learned then.

Why this?

I think, winter weather vs. summer weather.

There LOT theories flu worse winter, I've personally learned actually lot scientists quite sure. said, COVID crystal clear mind.

Animal studies shown cold weather affects cellular (T-cell) immunity. T-cells resource intensive, keeping body warm. Neutralizing antibodies small molecules pack huge punch, effective. cellular immunity (as opposed antibody/humoral immunity) takes big hit due cold weather. Cold weather also weakens - physically - membranes respiratory system. Physically, membranes weak link, boundary body's protected insides shield-outsides. immunity occurs respiratory system affects lot infections that's there's many respiratory diseases. there's that.

However, recent studies shown COVID actually inhibits antibody immunity. There's reasons. First, spike protein open closed position. closed, protein hide antibodies. may also true RNA SARS-CoV-2 actually turns antibody functions. We're sure yet.

So, hear ""T-cell"" immunity. true. We're learning particular virus important T-cell immunity memory is. But, unique virus. pathogens deal T-cell immunity. T-cell immunity like slightly less effective cousin antibody immunity.

Antibody immunity causes fever symptoms. signs body fighting illness.

So, SARS-2 turns degree, mild symptoms virus spreads lungs heart kidneys nervous system. bad. Eventually, healthy people see T-cells kick fight off. meantime, cells get widespread infection MUCH WORSE normal common colds flus. Thus, there's immune overreaction manifests either Long Covid severe symptoms lead death. critical COVID cases start mild 10 days SUDDENLY get bad. non-critical cases mild, people even symptoms. That's antibody immunity downregulated.

WELL.

In winter body prioritizing staying warm producing T-cells? Yeah, COVID particular bound worse. Worse flu cold weather, COVID leans super heavily T-cells cold weather affects particular.

So, get idea?

Let's see. None them, think plan go line's private islands. Awesome news!! Could imagine Reddit thread Trump mentioned one bootlicking followers screech it? Boo fricking fuck you, people choose sending kids school (leagally required usa) possibly get sick die end jobless, homeless probably get sick die.

While daycare insanely overpriced, money instance. 

The entire system fucked isnt peoples fault.

I assume cannot imagine stress ignore serious pandemic survive financially, via sending kids school. irony pretty sizable. think over-estimating attention span average person US. Half country seems pretending nothing happening. 

Going store, hell it. Indoor dining. Bars re-opening. 

It's insanity. 17 year old cough congestion Tuesday night. went work weds (small office 8 people, spread out) sent text broken hives. Every summer baby, prone gives gets virus. safe got tested Dr weds. I'm still waiting results. stayed home work Thursday decided rapid result testing Friday, showed positive. guess 17 year old positive well. Husband 13 yo tested yesterday Dr. we're sick home 10-14 days (pending test results). mild headache. fever. Today cough achiness. Oh fatigue like mofo. worked remote yesterday napped 2 hours cuz body stay awake. Fuck websites capture bury back button. independent review process concluded following recommendations independent safety review committee UK regulator, MHRA, trials recommence UK. joined survivor group got March, everybody get Long haul I‚Äôve read terrifying posts along visuals. symptoms particularly terrifying also still well month 6 Everyone virus dead bodies everywhere. Enjoy visit beaches nice. Keep bringing fear!! Rubbing one honor legends tonight.

**FUCK YESSSSSS** MIT? Wow, looks like junior high science protect airborne transmission, common sense exposure time, room size, ventilation human activity must also * Standing 6 feet apart safe seconds, maybe hours;
* 25 people safer large gymnasium crowded bar;
* 6-foot separation safer ventilated hospital inside sealed tent;
* distance, remaining quiet calm safer singing exercising;
* Social distance safely reduced facemasks worn. Sorry, meant July. edit. they're going send home spread infection home towns. 'Murica. probably bc dont wear masks japan winter coming. like education flourish force open unsafe schools. also families impacted children bringing home virus (and parents exposed too, creating spread among lower classes + school staff).

 solution unsafe school openings. supporting working class closing unnecessary operations. anyone need go bar, sit restaurant, theme park, movie theater, etc? argument ""the economy"" economy made construction government society absolutely control. extra $600 per week unemployment economy movie theaters opening frankly. I'm even grocery stores fully open. Emergency funds could given expand delivery pickup services, minimizing exposure. Surface transmission nearly big concern, sharing air / interior space risk. 

Then open learning labs / childcare minimally safely additional staff (can teachers volunteer, young people take jobs) pay, protect, benefit appropriately service. extreme needs. support ESE kids can't work online (not ESE) young children truly essential workers facilitate supply chains food etc give necessary medical care. 

This done. safe solutions. cost money require society values life interests big corporations values life frivolous pursuits, like entertaining feeling ""normal"". New Zealand - cases what? India central government stopped trying contain Sars 2. least 6 weeks ago. taken decision protect economy costs pursue herd immunity relation covid.
The government also focused strongly controlling narrative controlling media playing patriotic card. critical actions decisions taken government way anti india damaging country. 

Personally currently believe issues immunity months line India closer reaching herd immunity.  ""She corona positive, suffered symptoms - roamed bars highly contagious. Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria, American (26) triggered significant wave corona infections. district reacting cuts.

On Friday alone, 33 people tested positive. majority go back young woman, said district spokesman Stephan Scharf BILD. ""Because, despite symptoms, felt enjoy herself.""

The cases catapult so-called 7-day incidence (cases per 100,000 inhabitants within week) district critical 50 mark. According authorities, value currently 54.

The American staying ""Edelweiss Lodge"", hotel owned US Army. alone infected 23 people, according Scharf.""

Y'know, make sense anyway? STILL virus: STILL get contact w/infected victims, whether synthetic not. FUCKING idiots.

50% us won‚Äôt get transmit disease ... 50% reduces severity there‚Äôs less likely chance seeing severe symptoms requires hospitalization? sounds like absolute win?

UK peaked around 6,000 cases per day estimate many 100,000 cases day peak, probably Spain/France. I'm sorry absolutely insane $800 month acceptable amount tuition child school receive adequate education can't believe it. Like put money away every month months, would probably come handy right now. insane expensive schooling public schools could use funding right better kids. That's lie, kid's positive test prove it. can‚Äôt speak others, gym closed activity level plummeted first weeks this, deeply depressed. decided buy Peloton it‚Äôs done wonders mental health. don‚Äôt think anyone saying eliminates Covid stress completely. help stress overall.  downvoted statistician, can't help thought exactly did. bigger sample size, easier p value comparison means statistically significant. 

And course, think okay skeptical official messaging. We'll see close 0.05 p value published results read fine print. could go problems using ""p&lt;0.05"" big debate amongst statisticians, I'll leave now. seems like lot pandemic response pandemic. financial crisis cut people completely support systems. course suicides list?

I posted thread. Search again, filtering ""new"" :-) Thanks! We‚Äôll check stay university cease contagious weeks. minuscule chance getting sick dying, little chance infecting at-risk population. go home Christmas time, immune protect vulnerable. Herd immunity work virus. several studies talking this. Hey sorry dude, shoot dog something? need get quite defensive confrontational whole thing, I'll repost said:

 success (if call that) UK come implementation policy, like describe Sweden, people adopted best practices act personal responsibility.

Now see, I've made think quite balanced statement clearly makes reference failures experienced, apparently warranted sort pissing match better.

I get attitude this, seem annoyed something intention imply said. last words indicated thought ok / scary since wouldn‚Äôt hit you. That‚Äôs read it. 

A bit insensitive, since people 60.  beliefs conspiracy theories don‚Äôt make smart. Quite opposite. said nothing politics. Magical thinking morons. Morons tend make universally bad decisions. That‚Äôs think happening here. lot people can‚Äôt afford stay home though  concluded vaccine related. never said diagnosed TM - suspected, skepticism diagnosis quickly patient released hospital. Labs kinds freezers iirc? worked one years ago. see space huge issue though. I'm cherry picking, biggest pandemics similar diseases recent history. Adjusted population inflation, '68-'69 flu killed Americans covid currently has. stay fuck home. Florida paying us nurses 100$/hr clean shit show. Part sees infuriated, part goes, ""guess I'll finish paying mortgage next year?"" Almost 50 deaths today, positivity rate 11,8% many ICUs nearing maximum capacity already. 

And deaths lag 2-4 weeks behind infections. 

I think bad spring. really hope I‚Äôm wrong. much doubt majority infected 40. Wat percent infections become long haulers Hi. mean respect, human beings built bombed war zones either, are, fr years sometimes. Human beings meant forced become migrants refugees, are. Human beings built slavery, many suffer this. see fact ""we built this"" means bad, endure it. Sorry, picking comment, something I've thinking lately. level work involves. make really tasty meal like chicken parmesan takes one hour non stop. working full day really demanding times. I'll I'm everyday death rate spain infections happening month ago. hell support lootin riot fuck ppl moon. yes need police reform. must watching Fox News believe dem support kind things don‚Äôt lean left right like outlook this. Thanks sharing me! Yeah, why? quick look proves strains nearly bad COVID-19? top can't cherry-pick post WWII pandemics 2020 considering vastly different economic climate. Hospitals Miami-Dade lowest level COVID patients they've since March

You saying hospitals lying? come take fucking tour. Deniers want ignore computer models magical fortune telling device. 


There worst case scenarios, best case scenarios everything between.


As reality facts change, models change.


Deniers laugh ""worst case scenario"" ""They always wrong!! "". use justification ""Nothing do! Jesus take wheel! YOLO!"" moments. Add fact first reported death February 29th, still 10-month span.  Ordering definitely quality though. I'm saying excuse eat really poor substitute I'll definitely burn mine. people could infect? I‚Äôm guessing 60? that's Portugal Thanks info! Lmao good chunk population doesn‚Äôt even believe virus exists people want live last years enjoyment. grandma follows restrictions least anyone know thays would rather die year enjoying living 2 years home absolutely nothing. get it. Fantastic news Scientists test assumptions change positions based evolving evidence. completely appropriate. could argued, jumped unfortunate conclusion early time tested disproved, damage already done. problem magnified surgeon general Jerome Adams. ***DEATHS.***

Labor Day week ago.

they're dead yet. replied original comment. use good timed feeder wet food. food keep 12 hours minimum. used do, diabetic cat wet fed well, put three daytime meals feeder morning set timers appropriately. dinner time, would bring whole feeder downstairs clean load meals would get overnight. Next morning thing.

My reply original comment link feeder successfully used 2 years two old cats wet fed only, diabetic. That's invested first place, one best ways regulate blood sugar diabetic cat ensure eat small meals consistently throughout day, every 4 6 hours. swedish experts

Those experts also recommended everyone wear gas mask pretty much always (even home), take blood thinners daily prevent dying covid-19.

But Emikzen said. sources posted support claims make.   Sorry, concluded wasn‚Äôt TM? concluded TM vaccine side effect? Hey guys, 41/m/no underlying conditions...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'm positive I'm trying avoid anxiety dictating things, zero typical symptoms dealing fairly bad headaches (behind eyes, also sort dully radiating around head) eight days. 

It's usually twice day headache come go last least hour two slowly dissipate around head towards cheekbones face. take one dose panadol (paracetamol) much stop it, maybe helps bit.

Today felt somewhat mentally headache gone away. still able conversation several hours words bit hard find felt sluggish. Granted, done three hour hike (and two small beers lunch), maybe connected bit plus anxiety, feel totally like myself. 

My symptoms fairly regular, super intense pain bottom feet hands. even right lay bed, bit hips. 

I dealt venous insufficiency problems past led neuropathy, hopefully season changes bit, headache pain scares bit, I've told may symptoms without need respiratory symptoms appear.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone stories personal experience headache/some random body pains part Covid? so, elaboration long go away also treated?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks advance! reduce risk. virus eliminated vaccine. Even diseases regularly vaccinate US still exist there. vaccinated reduces likelihood becoming outbreak population. still get infected vaccination. successful vaccinations take years develop - months. first COVID vaccine merely stopgap give us edge. COVID still around years though even vaccinated people still get infected - less likely.

The real fix combination highly effective vaccine take several years trial error, effective therapeutics. combination. neither far. hope moderately effective early vaccine lower infection rates point.

Hollywood always got wrong outbreak type movies making people think vaccines cure. not. bullshit. want believe anyone questions origins virus somehow less connected science, they're automatically supporters Trump. politicized, things surrounding virus (HCQ, example). death rate low. looked statistics Germany 4 million doctor visits Influenza every year seasons 10-20,000 people die Influenza alone. guess get used numbers scary since Corona mortality rate 0,1-0,3 basically affect anyone 60. LOL! thought thing. 50% doesn‚Äôt cut chance getting virus half.

It cuts test group‚Äôs chance getting virus half almost everyone around vulnerable therefore, also dangerous.

If half population immune, virus transmits half much, means distancing would lead exponential growth without vaccine leads near extinction matter months. yes, we‚Äôll still need distance much less restrictive way. certainly interesting theory. I'm disturbed coming considering going rampant around Italy, viral load discussed reason medics died frequently. big logical leap, low viral load preference avoided I'm surprised headlining like 6 months later.

It one reasons wore ok mask early talk mandating it. wont stick. didnt Spanish flu. invest $60 battery operated timed feeder. cat many years diabetic. One best ways regulate blood sugar ensure small, frequent meals throughout day overnight. ton research, feeder wound set pretty easily, battery operated believe 4 sized batteries, worry near power outlet something happening power goes out. used load morning meals day, clean evening load meals would get overnight. Wash rinse repeat next day.

my cat got used really fast. fairly quiet, make kind little whirring sound rotates carousel put next meal open slot. sound something cat quickly learned meant food available. means, highly recommend this. :-) San Diego's cases rise, well way back restrictive tier indoor dining close. restaurants I've seen North County packed! Everything eventually goes back normal. really think still fighting effects 20 years now? criminal? 2 new cases today NZ. 6 China(yeah right). Vietnam one yesterday. Remember need one case start wave.  calling Hispanics well?  don‚Äôt need get risk zero return normal though. First, even 50% effective still gets us much closer herd immunity. Second, it‚Äôs respiratory virus. We‚Äôve millennia. becomes relatively low chance encounter (say around chances might encounter flu) nonsensical continue implementing restrictions. 

Remember flatten curve keep healthy systems getting overwhelmed, folks, eradicate virus. You‚Äôre right. made changes article read it. causing American public scared alarmed saying stuff? still saying knowing cause public scared alarmed? People forget police people too. suffer lockdowns like everyone else. Yeah. Lower viral loads give higher ratio asymptomatic infections (milder diseases average) still gives immunity. 

It‚Äôs theory. virus proofreading mechanism prevent downward mutations. potentially spreading deadly virus it‚Äôs ok brought steaks? eat lot paint chips kid?? amazing twist one's you‚Äôre talking getting back degree normality prior COVID, it‚Äôs going well 2021, **maybe** towards end 2021.""

Interesting left ""maybe"" statement seem neglect ""towards"" part. Fauci already predicted past summer, would back normal statement refute convention festival love stated ""sorry close year due coronavirus, see 2021"", something like that, put away pipe dreams right away, likely we'll *at least* two years emergency measures.

But even still, somehow equating pre-pandemic normal emergency measures place, never mind already began lessening increasingly get vaccine distribution progresses. Large concerts conventions things constitute normal life. Article makes interesting point partygoers freshman don‚Äôt know anyone school hoping make friends. doesn‚Äôt excuse it, gives perspective. mean, quite levels ""everything closed"" ""everything back normal"". Movie theaters open many places, crowded used be. bumbaclot *nice cheap vacation* 

You get pay for. get sick, stuck room whole trip. sound fun. social concepts hard grasp average redditor general, even without C19. looked Wikipedia France 170,000 cases July 30,000 dead. September 270,000 cases 3,600 dead. 600 dead per 100,000 cases? Things looks similar Spain. makes think cases back March must insanely high hundreds people dying per day. absolutely makes sense sleep patterns changed given people commute nearly much now. live Washington DC metro area, traffic congestion either second equal traffic congestion Los Angeles area. Horrible. more.

However, I'm waking later sleep patterns definitely altered. I'm harder time falling asleep, difficult time staying asleep, even sticking pre-pandemic schedule getting getting dressed putting makeup getting ready start work day.

I really understand explanation. look I‚Äôve always supposed Dakotas look. Nobody ever enforced gentle recommendations. teach authorities tough lesson. Wear mask? words, low viral load gives enough peoples natural defence fight it?

Edit: read it, yes. accurate summary. Backlog Labor Day weekend. I'm glad see way, friend. :) I‚Äôm concerned effects &lt;1 year. I‚Äôm worried life long ones.  anti-masker protests mostly Quebecois. Strangely Americans similar French. issue symptomatic.

This. actions clearly cross line general dumbfuckery intentionally accepting could harm people. Many thanks, good sir. ban marriages altogether? least hour half combined commute anymore. Instead wake 8 get work 9, just.. wake 9.


I'll stay bit later too, I'm actually getting much sleep, shifting according change lifestyle. Bullshit. 

The daily death toll WORLDWIDE last couple months 3-5K. sharp rise deaths.

Case numbers increasing due greater focus testing, yet deaths virus remained steady level. 

The economic fallout overall negative toll mental health lockdowns causing far damage virus ever Sounds like true American hope UQ vaccine first uses different approach. must goldfish-level attention span Half comments post that.  really. HIV changed habits? condom usage? probably still happens concerns getting pregnant. I'd debate really hasnt changed thing act. Yup. store day, really lot antimaskers live. guy came without mask. going say something, like, fuck it. governor made clear masks mandatory. ain't wearing one, he's bad fucking news. chose zero part it. remember correctly England got hit later Italy Spain France first wave I'm surprised they're starting get high cases again. Philadelphian, I'm concerned numbers may start going back due recent indoor restaurant re-openings. Another NPR article discussing results: Thanks this. way would holiday honor vaccine test subjects. Tons people still going gather holidays matter fauci says 222nm far UVC lamps emit light somewhere near 250nm. certainly dangerous.

I'll buy safer UV-B skin exposure, they're looking low doses.

Eye damage that's really scary. one thing say ""tears block it"" people chronic dry eyes catch bright reflection something? light invisible trigger blink reflex.

So interesting fundamental research, rushing kind tech market get public health disasters like thalidomide. Even dose kept regulatory limit there's possibility limit wrong. I'll bet set intention exposing general public. That's data dump. Back ""down"" today based recent history (about 1k). People need stop fooled data irregularities (maybe want ...). state country reports big jump decline that's way line last days, 100%, absolutely certainly data problem. Nature big jumps day. Also, water wet. matter point human. death result covid. That's exactly larger narrative designed be. *kids* assembling making things worse. *young people* ruining things throwing parties college! 

This completely fully redirects blame governments administrations allow behavior first place.

 Schools severely mismanaged endowments tuition dollars absolutely need hold in-person classes collect money. They're endangering students much severely bringing together actual students gathering. like nobody expected college students dumb things like throwing parties right now, acting surprised punishing students indiscretions intentional move defer blame administrations chose assemble first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, US government roll unemployment, UBI, small business support incentivize people stay home incentivize businesses stay closed. Instead, businesses reopen stay financially solvent employees go back work thereby providing spaces dreaded *young people* congregate. Blaming young people tactic shift blame away people power meant keep us safe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, blaming young people way assign blame activities one specific group. Sure young people might partying, people 40's 50's dinner parties sitting coffee shop patios day long. Young people convenient, seemingly homogeneous, much maligned group place blame people power responsibility blame. groups *intentionally* constructing ""kids blame"" narrative prevent blaming instead. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

A bunch fapping happening though baby blood protect COVID? think need trials that. Jnco jeans chain wallets, Guy Fieri haircuts. trying start discussion, Woman fault. Germany tested nightlife quite bad idea since second wave starts emerging Europe.

I would say Germany still quite lucky, cases 'stuck' 1,4 1,7k day, several countries (France example, 10k two days ago) broke highest cases per day number since start pandemic already.
It probably keep testing people coming close restrict borders. numbers stay low much longer. every person world needs vaccinated virus pounded ground. agree novel virus learning about, also isn‚Äôt gonna thing completely cripples human race. this, too, aware push around, still put one meal it.

-someone subreddit missing point.

***We idea post-infection quality life may be, long-term.*** know. know. educated/uneducated guesses.

Until know this, everything else reopening comes insane risk, especially testing decreased increased.

If opposite? testing increased, followed drop cases? different story. use data actually prove cases dropping, people safer, states safely move forward reopening earnest.

This sweeping garbage underneath carpet. I‚Äôm study coordinator one sites US even don‚Äôt know yet. Hopefully resuming soon! No, doesn't. disgusting behavior. I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre kidding. vaccine development British, American. Thankfully British politicians calling safe, well tested, thoroughly trailed vaccine. don‚Äôt see White House it. *DeathSantis entered chat* UK higher per-capita death rate US.  ... Arrogance problem fear instinctual, ingrained safety mechanism alert stay away dangerous situations.  first website, lot information used outdated, March well peaked. Especially first (much lower) IFR rate. I'd dig little further, though. 

The 2nd site, meh. right leaning opinion article right leaning semi-factual site sway opinion much. Thank June, considering sending back lot questions. also said teachers getting regularly tested since government mandate.  Younger?? Sweden one oldest population entire world lol. Put way: 83 y/o comorbidities pulls through, people start seriously questioning covid narrative. countries seem issues mask compliance well. That‚Äôs US thing, it‚Äôs human thing. compliance issues democratic republican states point. People getting sick jumping hoops using whatever arguments justify it. You‚Äôre little date. number longer take seriously scientists field I, American, assuming Let us leave country pls But....But....But....

PANIC! I‚Äôm /s one guess that‚Äôs downside internet, figured it‚Äôd obvious enough Cases don‚Äôt matter much death rate. wish could somewhat positive fact many people total cases died. Isn‚Äôt 90% survive lift good thing viruses? Don‚Äôt come I‚Äôm trying hopeful better future thought title said ""President Lung Damage"". Thank illustrating point. minute politicized, ***everything*** related pandemic viewed lens. 

It's fault populace much ones leading. much trouble here. that's rather point, we're past time change we're stuck. we're fucked. leaders perpetuating hoaxes deliberately downplaying risk, setting us lord chaos. lots friends family longer want talk to, Trump he's ISSUE times, agree reality situation.  insane. directed family guess tone polite? kids think said makes sense me. said monotone quick way since everyone line giving death glares Media outlets like Vox created visceral reaction people made want something like Trump simply antithesis that. Listening Ezra Klein talk really makes understand Trump happened. point whereing mask beneficial.However western cultures utalizing mask extent recomended currently would usualy thought byproduct germaphobia.Atlest 2020.

From perspective pespective people interact with,perpetual mask wearing still extreme mesure.

Basicly im standing willingly wanting mask still considered odd.Exspecily sick highly susceptible.Whitch normal health outlook hopefuly continue be. problem positive cases decline, states take opportunity reopen. Reopening causes interactions inside confined areas, without consistent mask use social distancing, cases rose. limited testing long incubation periods, take month number register. appears numbers going leading increased interaction. 

Soon, cold weather. People indoors more, sniffling sneezing more, can‚Äôt keep windows open, lower humidity.. good virus. think cases drop September October. start rise November, sort start see thanksgiving. week two thanksgiving travel start see huge spike early mid December, potentially worse July. Yes, true. You‚Äôd ignorant believe published death rates. reality, it‚Äôs far higher. Californians: FMLRN people article talking about. liberals rioting? Depends talk to, good friend perfectly healthy mother 56 died covid. Died ventilator. woman awesome ate healthy, ran races, exercise every day, spartan races, don‚Äôt understand happen, doctors don‚Äôt ether. pre-existing condition. third electorate worried Trump actually chance November. Like underpaid cast members Disney?? Lollll It‚Äôs obviously kid‚Äôs fault protected better lot places, ‚Äúduh‚Äù implication anyone thought kids wouldn‚Äôt transfer virus. It‚Äôs virus infects humans, kids human, ergo kids carriers...esp likely asymptomatic. Sorry, maybe different source that? Also even debating wouldn‚Äôt even surprised. guy responded said cases still going simply said point not. dont know, seems depend much, risk you. 
For personally think greatest risk could spread others, accept low (or slightly elevated) risk self-isolate days WFH alone.  70-80% *encounters*. 30% people immune, 70% get close people, could enough. Take word - everything possible. 

Check app - Vote Me. helps contact friends family remind vote. It‚Äôs really helpful. idea. Considering Spain still pretty hard lockdown universal masking since April great example things like restrictions masks far less successful people think.

Sweden's new cases adjusted population among lowest Europe now. Places deemed ""success"" (ie Denmark, Czechia) places masks heavy restrictions (Spain) seeing cases rises.

Sweden's going down. 

Either

A) virus got bored Sweden

B) Sweden secretly vaccinating population

C) Sweden reached level population immunity virus fading away.


Pick one. literally fault....zero leadership guy lol Exactly.  THAT's worth burning country for, right? Oh, real piece shit, ain't you?

By way, never actually unemployed. entire industry destroyed regulations going stand around wait fall apart. That's what, third incorrect assumption? Fourth? Wanna keep going?

Piss off, loser. hope act like work, it'll matter time you. hire clean toilets attitude. truly nonchalant privacy, send post full browser history last year. 

Takes nothing away us see seeing. sad,  frustrating hell.  Esp someone forefront field,  dealing administration.  still getting death threats family?  administration even said anything? lag short March/April cases caught people hospitalized. got lot longer later one caught earlier. 

Look graphs case/deaths int US July/August compared March/April, example. Lots redditMDs scoffing idea lungs ever permanent damage 

Look lot people recovering new outcomes lot patients still unknown. people permanent damage, don't. we're exactly sure enough people recover studies important. ""obvious"" all. strange virus, like girls. Alright. I'm moving. insane megalomaniac criminal white house, half government working Putin, almost half electorate care.  I‚Äôve stocking since Sturgis God comments suck. No, fucking ""obvious"", literally know virus affects human body. damage could permanent, thank god not. finding extremely important, whether smugly lean back armchair surprised are. median age Sweden 3 years higher US, certainly younger population news every time something starts go back normal cases continue dropping spite gradual re-normalizing already going on.

Have people forgotten plan popular beginning? top post time sshh ^you‚Äôre ^too ^loud Omg. can't imagine. truly can't. think would killed me. hope ok. ‚ù§Ô∏è site states 951 today, think screwed yesterdays numbers press release graphs match stated Per capita though US isn‚Äôt much better all. US worse Sweden Mexico really crazy. #12 countries worst #1, still better UK though Spain Belgium going developed countries. also, think US stands it‚Äôs mostly political United States compared country. think that‚Äôs stands honestly. Watching someone say whatever amendment says don‚Äôt wear mask think needs addressed. It‚Äôs pathetic make issue big something needs republican democratic. :( 190,000 deaths US currently, 410,000 deaths projected end year. would mean current projection 230,000 deaths 2 half months. That's definitely worse. That's true. week week change gave us warning signs early current surge, ignore completely. disturbing trend deaths mirroring downswing cases, signs showing getting older populations again. ok, summer heat kill virus.... Wait.... absolutely nothing said.

You claimed 

A) Sweden hard lock down.

This patently false.

B) Sweden reached herd immunity.

That necessarily patently false going explain virus steadily fading away nation months without interruption.  Ventilators keep people alive can't breathe own... mean point clear we're waiting saved vaccine. People change. Americans arrogant think need take long look mirror ask shitty person.

I'm one unemployed. Cause real Mericans die cheap. could prevented November 8, 2016. Aww, Fauci depressed? Join fucking club. happening first 30k mean going happen EVERY 30k. happened once, could one million, connected all. need time figure out. hard say this, but...If fiance wore mask like time...Well. First, think mean Doug Ford

Yeah, keep that. Thanks. really choice, everyone else lost jobs lot income. Luckily still ours. gave us $5 hour extra like month. suprise bunch us PTSD. know drinking issues. frustrating part, actual medical patients normally could help afraid (rightly) call, covid dieing. There's lot could do, restricted treatments sustainable aerosol generating. sort felt like collecting warm bodys. pronouncements. Like dont even attempt CPR, witnessed arrest not. would happily furloughed retrospect. Stay safe. remember seeing prediction early pandemic. couldn't/wouldn't believe it. know going end up. did. changed nothing long run. 

That's endorsing mandate, that's endorsing voluntary, situational usage. way, way late. Sweden's plan sucked got thousands killed.


Other countries much better U.S. Sweden death wise, economy wise, spread wide. True. true.  Biden gets elected, he's promised start kind nationwide task force. can't help feel like Trump's damage already done he's convinced many people live virus. Biden tries implement nationwide mask mandates example, people start protesting refusing. mess.

Do really think homeschooling could provide good education days ? would orders magnitude better traditional schools, could personalized, specialized according kid interests talents, taught best teachers almost everywhere planet. 


And thing many people complains -""kids needs go school socialize"" . Really? school place earth every child every human civilization ever able socialize? 


Schools forces kids interact random people, kids otherwise even encounter, instead letting chose want spend time with. inevitably leads bullying traumas , know. kids can't choose , options spend half day random people, prisoners do. 


 fact, socially speaking, schools probably making harm helping kids. , course, excellent daycare centers. Yeah, provincial license would taking job Canadian citizen, fuckin deal mean, take step back look USA become glory days post WW2 prosperity, much boomers absolutely destroyed 'American dream'... impressive. Extremely depressing, impressive none-the-less. Really. would need survey obvious fact? certainly newsworthy. lot South Korean protesters believers almighty space fairy protesting can't get together large numbers cause massive spikes infections like last time. morons.  possible prisons achieved herd immunity now? many people confined space, burn entire prison population quickly.

If that's case, see major risk. now. know zero virus spreads, dense population factor not. know seems affect elderly people different ethnicity. majority deaths Sweden swedes, follows similar pattern saw NY ethnicity played major role deaths antibodies. 

It ""healthy"" died. 

Sweden early talked social distancing hygiene. Sweden declared national emerges February. 

In fact Sweden precautions place place compared nordics countries weeks ago. Denmark changed gathering rules allow 500 people, encouraged people get back work, 85% could return. planned open spor events. 

Sweden change little policies pandemic believe continue exact path either heard immunity vaccine place. 

Sweden single increase deaths since peak April. true country Europe. US path manade keep good work August. That's 9/11 bro. Get program, bad guy Chinese peop... mean Chinese government. [Urban density linked higher coronavirus infection rates‚Äîand linked lower COVID-19 death obvious correlation check country data either.

Also, Sweden [1 (bottom-right chart), California [111 explanation nearly sufficient explain discrepancy, obvious answer U.S. simply handling horribly. mandatory masks Spain second surge. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Also, give glass water 30000 someone severe side effect. something else. think represents cage Hey ""Americans"", **(ELI5)** (so 50% ""adults"" actually understand this)

- Pandemic control (Canada); 0 deaths
- Pandemic control (US) ; 200.000 deaths one email sent Thursday night instead Friday morning, Karen? know rest world enlightened progressives love science ^when ^they ^agree ^with ^it Jesus christ dude.... would narrowly avoided giant massacre vacation. Yes bro, 1 prc death rate= chance kidding right?  LOL foundation. spent years specific type analyst: can't go details, partly specialized software, partly lot experience niche field. Can't anything without good Excel/SQL foundation, though. :)  bad trend

this Orwellian newspeak looks like. like gonna able go anyways Bye look spain /s Sweden didn‚Äôt hard lockdown, lot measures taken life Sweden far normal. 

Sweden measures place since April. European countries level today. Hahah  Cases spreading youth, every bit data government shown even government stated that, 2 weeks ago cases also beginning spread general populations. Hospitalization rates beginning rise exponentially now. Downwind hospitalization rates deaths.

If want snapshot France look like 2-3 weeks, watch Spain. 

Another factor death rate 10% like France‚Äôs stats show, it‚Äôs probably closer 1%. currently finding much virus due increased testing March/April. It‚Äôs number worrying, exponential growth. calculations, taking account numbers double every 2 weeks (the government‚Äôs words, mine), 80,000 cases day 6 weeks, bring us back March‚Äôs death rate roughly 800-1000 day. 

But let guess, went head wouldn‚Äôt conversation. Imbecile. Looks like someone‚Äôs herd immunity right üòâ hospitalizations 10x 3 weeks ago Upvoting hope puts dent ""Americans stupid selfish"" mindset subreddit has. Meanwhile Romania 1500 cases day around 50 deaths goverment like fine, go school. move Canada? Wow. guy video super chill murderer. credit union waving overage fees problem is, people believe they're trying ""make us wear forever"" ""covid always going here"". I've got friend seriously believes fine (to point ""accidentally"" got pregnant despite working nursing home...) understand someone could accept something like like problem. actually like wearing mask, unsanitary anything less right now. like idea forced wear one.

If talked even time period, endpoint driven data (once infections reach x percent...) I'm sure would incentive. may need vaccine reach that, may not. feel like based period time like that, explanation reasoning behind it, makes really confusing. 90%.

Ninety percent Canadians within 100 miles US border. archived page backed version case linked source gets removed/changed/borked. many people can‚Äôt handle partying  many emojis easily say you‚Äôre lying sack shit I'm care worker office me. thanks presuming ;) argument made UBI well.

ETA: watched couple beginner tutorials YouTube haven‚Äôt super helpful. Imagine making alt/troll account that. loser. nothing it. Firstly, Italy first high deathtoll living arrangements (old people living caring young) Lombardy governor idea putting sick people care homes virus spread like wildfire. Italy seen strong second spike besides people coming home abroad reckless mass gatherings. pandemic responsible people shitty completely sociopathic entirely 100% us.  Get ready BC smoke lol seen new lately. rich celebrities got caught paying get kids college. pretty disgusting. news make virus less infectious dangerous fatal? news bring anyone back life? No? shut fuck up. friend's dad master's degree electrical engineering University Mumbai government Alberta made entire power engineering curriculum get class 1. told ""I could design plant ground up, yet made go back school look gauge."" like rememher quote Rainer Maria Rilke things going well:

It‚Äôs 6 feet apart....because apparently us Americans wouldn‚Äôt fucking join metric scale. ya know...go team! nothing rational forcing infected people onto others. bullshit know it. Canadian travel RNs make bank states this.  People dislike good news dislike uncertainty news absolutely take uncertainty away.  people need serious mental help. said wished taiwan did. 
Testing tracing important thing followed masks followed border control. USA closed emea border horse left stable. pointless time. Wow, really time it! must awfully scary expecting. Definitely hope getting enough rest, know that's hard parent, especially young also sick. (My daughter would commiserate, six kids 3 seven, plus 2 teens.) Definitely never dull moment teens around, right? Hope feel much better soon. Hang there. heck year, maybe months things much better around. mention mutation rates quite different. 100,000 probably realise **are** safety trial. Bubonic Plague didnt exist huh?

You know, thing killed like 2/3rds words population? may entirely possible, countries get cases near zero one two day. benefit people go lives again, worry wearing masks, meeting friends restrictions. worry. I'm sure upstanding citizens partying shoulder shoulder Granville Street every Friday Saturday heed warning even bringing HIV compare SARS-CoV-2? HIV quite labile. far SARS-CoV-2 doesn‚Äôt level fragility. primary means transmission different. theses characteristics factor infectivity. It‚Äôs pointless comparison. guy Excel dont ask Canadian immigration laws Dont blame them, thoughts crossed mind least pandemic. Dont know kind state mental health years now, taking huge toll moment.

then goes hospitalised¬†late August developed ""breathing problems"". said awaiting COVID-19 test result. title super fucking disingenuous. awaiting covid19 test result died. Nope  Trump what? then? How‚Äôs lockdown going? 

Asking friend....from Victoria Australia Plus got good weed eh taking worse pandemic human history seriously?!?!?

Is joke? This! Please stay province ffs Buddy lack testing capability biggest problem far. Canada right never shut border much later 1/100 problem. That‚Äôs minor part of. lack testing capability thing stunk USA. presidents lack leadership made 1000times worse. continues so. border going open till next year earliest bro.

Why stay home summer, once? think mask looks generic. 86% Canadians urban. comparable urban densities lockdown whole winter? realize that. heard influenza better usual much else hit news here. happened Indian friends Dad. hit friend really hard since. really feel India people. Oh wow, everyone else did. Crazy! see people false hope virus completely disappearing happening anytime soon. whole purpose mask social distancing overwhelm hospitals slow deaths. vaccine (just like flu vaccine flu), what‚Äôs point public health measures?

i found reliable source direct SK soomlab-korea.com

edit: see tried airqueen. nice video!

i'm little surprised airqueen tests. CDC tests showed around 90-97%.
personally, think comfort ridiculously high, scenarios trade might worth it, think might try ones now.

i find interesting find airqueen collapses. maybe breathe hard, like exactly *because* lips never touch mask. can't really Serve Fast Food online, whereas teaching learning done online.

I see gripe emphatize working site really need be, argument invalid.

I think responsible move possible work home employer employees strive that.

The infection potential 2,000+ students congregating indoors school little ventilation hours comparable operating 2-3 person kitchen employee dropping bag food 1 person drive thru. Dude, unfortunately everywhere. say bad leaders, say bad leaders. supposed different here, large populace contracted COVID19 scary thing put it, used large population numbers see today unfortunately expected. numbers might nation might also something expected respect population average. opinion, someone expecting number cases we've got today back first 10,000 cases found, ignorant (sorry, mean say world ignorant I'm like enlightened anything, saying government least started taking measures way actually did). leaders built temple scapegoat (in opinion) use people's religious sentiments distract important subjects. SC seems lost way media busy making scapegoats people, subtly ignore bigger distressing topics. Everything seems like facade. one know one thing, nobody else, gotta ask right questions government (whether answer me/reflect question/put behind bars another matter) act responsibly public abate spread virus. believe many people share sentiment gives hope. Come may, we'll survive believe (well easy say given privilege still). There's hypocrisy ignorance everywhere, even within me, I've chosen, like many others embrace change.

Lol kinda went overboard. allowing link directly Forbes article? click bait bs. Sure bro I‚Äôll get right Could testing though record: 40% Peruvian households refrigerator, meaning residents shopping freaquently markets. proved one ""main sources contagion"".

**No credible evidence supporting claims laboratory engineering FURIN SITE SARS-CoV-2 COPY CHOICE ERROR MIXED INFECTION BATS

I found probable source putative insert adds RRAR furin site SARS-CoV-2.

Ten 12 nucleotides RRAR insert identical sequence spike protein gene Bat Coronavirus HKU9 isolated Rousettus fruit bat Guangdong province 2011.

In HKU9 code TSAG loop region known Gao terminology SD3. first CT putative insert still orphan, relevant possible source rest, albeit frame.

The ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù CT CCTCGGCGGG, last ten identical sequence HKU9.

The sequence context similarities, i.e ‚Äúcagac‚Äù upstream ‚Äúc‚Äù downstream ‚Äúinsert‚Äù aligned here:

HKU9 gcatttgta **caga------cctcggcgggc** ctctgt

CoV-2 tatcagact **cagac** ttgct **cctcggcgggc** acgtagt

Total 14 19 identical nucleotides two runs one gap. That‚Äôs lock.

Copy choice errors mixed infections exact context, since recombination, RNA polymerase hopping one template strand another. case two templates code gene, regions thousand nucleotides one another, genome 30,000 nucleotides. could easily evolution site since mixed infection, period years.

This cannot coincidence.

The natural range host Bat RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, microbat Rhinolopus affinis, overlaps Rousettus fruit Macrobat Yunnan province. latter used bush meat. Also, Microbats Macrobats known co-habit caves. alternate source virus human infection could mixed bat guano cave mixed population.

So definitive source pandemic mixed infection viruses similar SARS-CoV-2 Bat HKU9 ‚Äì copy choice error resulting insert SARS-CoV-2. Could occur bats, intermediate animal human.

Human incubation SARS-CoV-2 could hop max speed train, direct line Kunming Yunnan Province disembark Wuhan train station 6.5-8 hours later, sometime last fall. line began service 2017.

Infected Yunnan, spread there, goes Wuhan, he/she either falls ill spreads asymptomatically another person, initiating pandemic there. initial outbreak occurs short distance Wuhan train station good reason ‚Äì arrived.

This accidental mixed infection wild, infection human form bush meat bat guano, carries high speed train Wuhan ‚Äì likely series events leading pandemic.

The laboratory required natural laboratory bat cave multiple species bats bat coronaviruses.

Here's hoping Washington state keeps sharing second hand smoke send visitors home.

Smoke sucks COVID worse. Good work Canada! Great news It‚Äôs common countries wear mask sick.

1 side wants use modern technology side wants use technology 900 years ago. Summer vs winter maybe Coming Melbourne, close friends BC &amp; watching numbers. Can‚Äôt believe govt seems really anything increasing numbers. fear 2 months behind went through. cases tracking trajectory suddenly skyrocketed. We‚Äôve lockdown since 30th June probably end October, yet less active cases BC &amp; daily average back around 50. borders also shut states throughout Australia virus managed states tourism. contradicting, likely possibility absolute words, imply there's chance something else possible. literally two options happened- adverse reaction due vaccine, wasn't. going? arguing, based evidence presented, shows lockdown working Victoria ""lockdowns work"".

I never said anything Sweden's situation, Peru's. made realize amount deaths state COVID even making news anymore. People getting used it. live city 2 major universities/colleges. Tonight drove downtown watching raptors lose PACKED students houses trashed students even 1 person sure going send second wave. know 2 people who've died covid know many people.

You people fucking nuts. And... Copy video game people call hero copy mask everybody loses minds. Schools reopening soon, least B.C. numbers going up. friends family prepared round two electric boogaloo hunkering another weeks Oooh yeah you‚Äôll see people absolutely ridiculous sub act like it‚Äôs over. Everything. It‚Äôs over. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre thought process.

My suggestion you... get sub you‚Äôre new. Otherwise you‚Äôll keep getting sucked back getting pissed every time see 99% comments posted LOL. like guy sitting traffic complaining traffic part it. going back work? pursuing herd immunity strategy? don‚Äôt know reinfection body yet, know clotting response devastating. think real cause concern don‚Äôt really know yet. sub created TON people saying fear monger, huge deal 100k US projected deaths overblown. Well, are. don‚Äôt think thing gonna kill spot, worry could life expectancy. Schools opening, people asked get asymptomatic tests classes start, gonna find cases. already bylaw edmonton, be. really sure enforcing though They‚Äôre probably going 99% effective vaccines been. pandemic end deaths hospitalizations decrease tremendously. vaccine that, masks social distancing go. Chances completely eradicating virus low. We‚Äôre watching pins needles!! Congratulations Canada! Keep example us Americans proceed. Also wouldn‚Äôt say COVID-19 vaccine anyway. would name virus. Also would Portuguese. disregard I'm referring too. 

Its joke, 

""The last time checked, America."" -Randy Marsh Laughs Indian case numbers. Swedish state media month reported ‚Äúthe US one countries hit hardest corona virus‚Äù, mention relation population size absolute numbers (it absolute numbers completely uninteresting fact.) logic prepared wear mask rest life. ever eradicated one virus. vaccines made effective. thats good enough you, yeah feel free keep wearing mask. 

once vaccine worldwide circulation people around get access, fuck mask. reporting first-hand experience: Stockholm last month nobody wearing masks, neither indoors outdoors. Make will. how? followed every day 23. Jan bought immediatelly 20 n95s. Everyone laughing me, live Serbia, idiocracy special kind. ended giving 7 bfs family members, somehow forgot ridiculed month before.

Narative begining shitstorm keep medical personel, tin foil lunatic, clear signal wear exactly those. Except already proven cause severe neurological issues 1 30000 people. patients aren‚Äôt dying means haven‚Äôt injected enough them. numbers small enough scenario 2 overwhelm hospitals everything open anyways.  Pandemic response goals shift... nature beast. happening perfectly expected. countries whining shit... Bobby able get college Henry Winkler forges hush school diploma. single fact driving nuts. Bonnie Henry stand something?  OMG sealioning me. started strawman, advanced sealioning. substance anything say. rhetorical tricks. see boring meaningless argue like that? course don't. people same. would Boomers.

That‚Äôs really way numbers work. smaller numbers effected error. general, smaller numbers less valid scaling per capita values gonna be. still pandemic provided false data ccp arrested whistleblower doctors journalists. 

50 cents comment, Mao likes Wear mask social distance when? flu vaccine done thing years: reduce chances infection decreases hospitalizations deaths. exactly need virus that‚Äôs whole point public health measures first place. think wearing masks social distancing virus 0% gone game plan, think that‚Äôs little naive unrealistic. Pretty much. hasn‚Äôt coherent leadership public health US. Canada interesting next month schools opening well else new, is

after months blaming China, Democrate, WHO, Europe etc. know real danger covid-19 back Febuary, hmmm that's expected Trump would they? People claim pro life care lives agency matter. College students right choose whether go class comes risk. logic prolifers anything dangerous like circus acts, speeding, sugar, standing outside storm.  Oh, we're reporting now? According Fauci US still first He's right. Hopefully everyone follow lead. Otherwise could long haul. Think 3 years, luck. That's long took eradicate (errr...live through) Spanish flu. never debate regarding anyone age 11 precise. started saying general public ""doesn't know how"" wear N95 masks, ""you NEED fit-tested"", whole bunch shit.

I REALIZED weird ""mask thing"" going on, everyone thinks. selfish wear mask. selfish wear kind masks ""supposed go healthcare workers""? dunno, ended buying bunch without valve. ones look lot less weird. skeptical?  trust media aren‚Äôt polarized.  federal government provincial governments working together letting experts drive policy. 

Liking us mind blowing what‚Äôs going on. watched Canadian news, media shifted talking daily death counts daily case numbers keep fear high. They‚Äôre lying Yes. Enough enough. virus real doesn‚Äôt justify traumatizing world‚Äôs population indefinitely. simply opened schools. Everyone expected that. predominantly impacts educated Liberals. virus ironically cruel? Gen Z. impatient, selfish idiots world. thought scoured history found something damning. lying? Holy shit lol Unemployed person steals. 

That sounds correct. Would safe assume heart kidney damage too? exactly why. article doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno new deaths‚Äù  Explain rest world accomplished it, please I'll waiting. I‚Äôm protected vaccine aren‚Äôt others? would jokes dies I'm even American. Cases going though. US testing 800,000 people every day running 40 cycle threshold PCR tests course theyre gonna findna ton positives. Thanks! fun seven years here, feels like triple actually, always fun stuff experience. hope get healthy soon get back lovely city Well, fault them....not every situation allow instant clarity...with regard sciences, information may able accumulate slowly, one step time. 

We'll get there, it'll take time uncover number things concerning coronavirus &amp; covid-19. Better healthcare systems healthier population. Sweden likely hit herd immunity well theyve minimal deaths while. Sorry buddy, I'm still going SD Tuesday. Same! wear mask, I‚Äôm ready social distancing mask wearing done. I‚Äôm taking vaccine soon it‚Äôs available.

I feel like people thriving this. really understand difference mandating/ordering coordinating consistent science-based approached defeating virus?

Are really trying tell president right bring state leaders room work deal? (Ironically, particular president prides artist this, failed needed so).

You keep saying thing like broken record, keep telling effort coordinate reaction tactic fight virus.  keep telling president's power sit room crying wringing hands?

Imagine world president actually said ""I know lock uncomfortable masks fun, need this"" instead ""I wear mask, neither want"" ""Liberate Michigan!"".

If think overestimating power federal government fighting pandemic, grossly underestimating much influence federal government really central coordinator nationwide effort.  See get work transfer company. Canada let specific skills... example, college degree political science, taught Excel became pretty good analyst, ticket in. folks - nurses, coders, engineers, etc even easier time getting in.

Just make sure act - wait election day. :( Sort of. Population density would play account well, makes weird ass math Guess ""others"" get vaccine then. There's media outlets drilled heads mask wearer's enemy. Common sense empathy others lost people. I'd wager humidity sunlight.

Plus, know people traveling celebrate holidays.

If works like flu (and based droplet stuff, see wouldn't) may easier super spreader events humidity drops.

In *PLoS Biology* February 23, 2010, researchers reported often significant drops absolute humidity weeks prior flu outbreak. ""This dry period requirement triggering influenza outbreak, present 55-60% outbreaks analyzed, appears increase likelihood outbreak,"" Shaman says.

A 2-dose vaccination regimen inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates administered 20 rhesus macaques (divided four groups equally).

One group administered placebo, three groups immunized 3 different vaccine candidates 0 14 days. macaques exposed viral challenge 14 days 2nd dose.

The results showed protective efficacy, increasing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG neutralizing antibodies, reducing replication virus nasal cavity, throat, lung tissues monkey.

No evidence pneumonia observed histopathological examination vaccinated groups, unlike placebo group

Adverse events seen animals immunized two-dose vaccination  probably feel way sometimes. going take lot patience everyone pulling together. reality lost. clamped hard two months strong tracing whenever outbreak - would fine

A literal handful countries achieved this.. even they've maintained stronger lockdowns since actually point make? defense? Going stick poorly addressing 1% comment? Okay, that's fine.

And that's lot words you? Christ. Good luck. *Atlantic bubble slides slightly away* COVID cause pulmonary fibrosis results permanent lung damage. Scar tissue replaces ling tissue reversible.

Would love someone could explain this. Imagine getting like 20ml vaccine injected too. thing huge  I‚Äôd interested hear answers too. read awhile back doctors thinking virus may weakened bit. thought people got first sickest went hospitals either stayed long time unfortunately passed away. also suggested weaker strains spread longer period fatal strain people ‚Äúless fatal‚Äù strain spreading one?

I don‚Äôt know anything ever came theories though haven‚Äôt heard much recently. 

I also read heard medical workers know, ventilators used last resort putting patients right away. cares? China country successfully re-opened schools. Germany, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Canada, Australia, etc., re-opened schools. big deal? Florida man wins biggest loser. Send home parents. Prune family tree. ample sources? Bars reopened like month ago (in Quebec), bunch restrictions. Talladega wild. congrats here. case count rise. 100 cases day Ontario 200. Schools open Monday Ontario provincial government even spent money federal government gave make classrooms safe. guy charge back school Ontario never went public school. Give us ring month. Omg scared might die. Please tell so. 3:41, blurs. Lol. Words words words words like fucking lefty meme Jesus Christ  Canada testing way people, they're findings cases. never understood concept ‚ÄúWell work home keep kid home you.‚Äù No, job requires work watch kids. 500K kids (reported) contracted covid US. owner idiot. getting exhausting. I‚Äôm Ontario it‚Äôs true saturation, many friends taught/ teaching abroad many substitute teaching can‚Äôt find full time job. find one, believe average salary around 70-80k full time position. enough, apparently. That's inhumane. Canada zero death countries like Sweden almost zero yet California still 170 deaths single day? Nebraska hardly hit COVID yet. way see excess deaths comparing flu season.

and see excess deaths 5 last 6 weeks one excess last interested, play around CDC page.

dude, new cdc website excess deaths page, thanks.

I understand Nebraska geographic advantages thus shutdown nation happened much spread Nebraska.

I understand Nebraska ""only"" 224 deaths per million relatively less effected covid19.

I also know 5 last six weeks show excess deaths, spite lockdown going months varying degrees around nation spite Nebraska middle nowhere, looks like getting deaths now, great time open up.

Nothing say change objective another cdc page.

There 393 combined Flu/Pneumonia deaths 2017 342 2016 397 2015 350 2014.

per worldometers Nebraska 434 deaths covid. counted every single covid death, already entire year flu. one currently dies new infections occur, covid already killed 20 percent people flu pneumonia does. I

and that's lockdown social distancing.

so know exactly looking vaguely refer excess deaths, quote numbers make specific verifiable claims.

but covid deaths outnumber flu deaths already.  r/upliftingnews Oh find this? ??? sure point? referring comparing Spanish Flu deaths COVID deaths, sure less people existed then. However, much better medtech medicine. even antibiotics bacterial infections flu actually made half deaths. 

Pretty tough compare pandemic 100 years ago now. lot changed. point 300k deaths early pandemic large death toll.

When H1N1 seasonal flu displaced H2N2 1957 100k Americans died. rearranged made H2N3 1969 (worst flu year post Spanish Flu) 100k Americans died. 300-400k deaths new virus lot even today's population. kid yourself. mitigation efforts. 

Edit: Also, read first paragraph? Sure seems like it. wear mask I'm forced wear one kind like I'm getting vaccine people get sooner social distancing masks fucking done. would motivated get vaccine still things? make look good upcoming elections. tradition  chug bottle syrup never took football thaaaat seriously played, lot towns it‚Äôs basically like town church...it kind ties community together. lot kids families it‚Äôs vital part lives. saying that‚Äôs good thing bad thing...it is. What‚Äôs good countries seen second waves (looking USA) experienced many deaths. 70,000 cases second peak 1500 deaths day, first peak 40-50,000 cases day around 3000 deaths day. good news know treat lot better used able to. happy thing He‚Äôs making dumbass joke southern border US joke since US depends cheap immigrant labor survive Sir, respect we‚Äôve hunkering since March. Smh. stand corrected. Says white collar bureaucrat work remotely earns nice salary so, tell blue collar workers. coronaviruses (like cold virus) mutate get six months. We've told COVID mutating slowly. God wish Ranked Choice Voting.

Look color revolutions Arab world. Instead ""wishing"" something, sitting around waiting next election, people color revolutions took streets demand change. Think moment. 

How many protests right now, calling resignation sitting US President? many demonstrations right calling fair elections?

Why not? Look buddy. sorry lost friend. people die flu pneumonia every year. different. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre much closer Armageddon Rapture, we‚Äôre better!‚Äù

‚Äî evangelical right, probably Well first must fight one geese  115k x 2 = 230k. US 197k today think understands tie shoes, let alone aerosols. Remindme! December 31, 2020 Damn thanks Doctor. I‚Äôd happy 50 25 percent odds! (50 percent low end) I‚Äôm new sub I‚Äôm catching many, many people seem want forced lockdown vaccine think we‚Äôre going die. Nice see rational postings. far supporting angry white supremacists, enforcing geared cops protests, lying constantly, leader Twitter tantrum every second day can‚Äôt stop sexist, racist, narcissist, think speaks itself.

I particularly care whether next President lies constantly, Twitter tantrum frequently. really affect me, pretty much Americans, either. whether sexist, racist, narcissist, really matters policies laws able enact. President could sexist, racist, narcissist wants. long none impact lives everyday Americans, cares personal flaws?

As white supremacists, one would hope next President crack white supremacists like went Al Qaeda, i.e. extraordinary rendition, black sites, Guantanamo Bay. all, white supremacists big threat Al Qaeda, treating way. reason use different strategy simply White-Americans, there? No, say it. Say easily forego mail voting social distance wear masks polls. time published death toll 115k forecasted 230k September. US 197k today. Pretttttty close quote Squirrelly Dan: ""Must f***in nice!"" Hmm... Skeptical, wish northern neighbors best hope beat fucking virus. We're fucked US. pure shit reasons. 4% carbon emissions world come those. mask's supposed go nose well mouth because, know, part respiratory system. never want anyone perish disease correct masking part whole ""hands, face, space"" saying reason. hard. still feel bad fiance's friends family think going happen utilize safe practices?

Edit: clarity pic fiancee, deceased. disagree statement all. 

I think people seem expect virus act completely different viral infections, times doesn't. power comes fact novel.

The idea ""this virus different others"" often used somewhat fearmongering tactic. makes people afraid could anything. also shown little people knew viruses general. 

There novel viruses ones before, deal them. Maybe sooner think. H5 H7 become able infect humans could nasty novel influenza pandemic hands. Part dealing knowing expect minimize unknown. used concerned north side border honestly gotten boring watching US politics bullshit comes it. stopped watching around million cases. This. 100%. COVID decimated small businesses offered ""benefits"" exchange owners workers. can't tell move towards socialism, case, I'm happy see end ASAP, death toll socialism America gonna hell lot higher 250k. Let people go back work. COVID makes fear life personally, stay inside. Like anything else, protect government piss poor job protecting anybody. government's job command citizens anything, matter beneficial think would be. Look Sweden, country done fuck-all prevent corona. deaths per capita comparable US, absolutely screw small businesses bought new mega corporate overlords. conclusion: whatever fuck want. virus force nature, without vaccine, there's little stop country personal freedom sort priority. lowering virus levels communities safer go outside first place. power withhold federal funds get non compliant states in-line. states living heavily dole. 

We need unmuzzle CDC, get OSHA issue enforce workplace guidelines. 

If necessary need federal mask mandate, state level enforcement, withholding federal funds comes in. ‚ÄúPeople came near death cases. life-threatening illness,‚Äù said.

Most SARS patients extremely sick, surprising long term consequences. Covid patients ICU-sick. It‚Äôs good analogy. additional money pay daycare correct. like death wedding day. medical bill cannot pay. good advice take. would've thought? figures Huh! feel you! reason Mom believed discussed doctors urgent care/COV19 testing center, work. Mom biggest disbeliever anything read New York Times. took lot effort get see true. right, Spanish flu % population 5 times coronavirus, even 5 times less coronavirus could still kill millions winter, despite curve currently downturn. Yep, is. isn‚Äôt free need wall  No, them. die. enough care about.

What magic number way? What‚Äôs maximum socially acceptable number dead kids you? Except teachers forced go back, parents allowed work home now, given chance go back work send kids school. 

No matter schools choose do, people suffer. It‚Äôs really shitty situation. pay regardless whether kids though.  TSA protest always arrive early enough ""opt out"" body scanner someone come personally feel up. enough

virus dont care. virus dont give shit. Leonardo DiCaprio Departed 2 sisters go school Ohio Florida ( keep seeing that). One sisters already applied withdraw person classes scared. play actually flipped, feels slimy do... sort national strategy.

Like, contingency plan get really sick?

Are really selfish get sick put others risk, essential positions like health care workers?

Your example flawed, dont see wearing mask makes better.

Why wear mask, maintain distance, yet still businesses open? Yay hate life shity headline, everyone knows talking America. completely fucked us. Actually, Alberta reported death...
The numbers change reclassified previous covid death covid, total change. say death toll large already lying yourself. excess deaths explosion ""pneumonia"" deaths we're looking 300k deaths least America, probably more. three waves three years Spanish Flu killed 700k US. already almost half way there, that's considered deadly pandemic modern history. 300k+ mitigation efforts. 

If saying bad initial WORST CASE SCENARIOS experts laid out, yes, been. worst case scenarios. look early predictions, death toll actually pretty close moderate scenarios predicted, believe 400k (deaths end summer) one common median scenarios pretty damn close look excess deaths. Anyways, put worst case scenario that's decisions made, least assume anything moderate less than. 

Yes starvation, less lockdowns behavioral changes pandemic. lockdowns quite ago, joblessness rise businesses still closing. financial hardships caused pandemic unavoidable, happen locked couple months. fact nations weathered financial storm best aggressive containment strategies. We've seen hurts national economy lot undergoing continuous, uncontrolled surges aggressive containment early followed proverbial whack mole virus.

People try put hardships lockdowns fit narrative, fit really. experts made clear early on: take hit now, take later extended period. 

Now can't protect high risk people? Well work today's society. Everyone interconnected, can't lock elderly away, even could, take care then? take care shut out? virus spreading population work way risk groups, seen play already. mention 1/3 America fits high risk group due obesity diabetes prevalent. would impossible lock away 1/3+ country rest us go over. released virus would begin spread immuneless population.

People die COVID, yes. one really dying ""lockdowns"". Again, made nonsense fit narrative. governments able lockdown meanwhile provide people, lucky US, govt, idea lockdowns. lot worldwide starvation due COVID state global economy now, unavoidable. pandemic nature cause economic hardships whether lockdown not.

Lastly, also know enough virus let infect everyone go business. long term data yet course, concerning. Multiple organs taxed damaged many survivors. reason people may tell ""google it"" old news we're tired digging links people paying attention science behind virus. know long term damage cases, look dire. immediate stats like studies showing heart inflammation 60% survivors worrisome (that study 1/3 hospitalized patients 2/3 home, may skew bit high, still, concerning). early studies showing kind noticeable organ damage half patients 2-3 months later. Again, realize permanent, stats severe standard viral infection bring pause caution. population people increased rates heart defects decreased lung capacity would detrimental economy society general lockdown.

I think end world mantra sub get old, definitely exaggerated. definitely hope right now. bad could been, signs many areas may seen worst it. equally bad, worse take dismiss something move virus ready ""move on"". COVID makes fear life, stay inside. Like anything else, protect government piss poor job protecting anybody. government's job command citizens anything, matter beneficial think would be. Look Sweden, country done fuck-all prevent corona. deaths per capita comparable US, absolutely screw small businesses bought new mega corporate overlords. conclusion: whatever fuck want. virus force nature, without vaccine, there's little stop country personal freedom sort priority. wasnt obvious highly probable.

We 17 year studies done people suffered identical complications SARS-cov-1. vast majority recovered back baseline. Nah nice way saying doesn't. Wtf? Testing direct impact contact tracing literally numerator CFR. Good job Canada! California, Washington, ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù learn guys! Best wish Canadians üëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è fine bunch 18-22 year olds.

A friend mine big birthday coming week planning party ~30 people. housemates planning attending also attended multiple Labor Day parties. I‚Äôm point trust friends less less distanced things like hang porch go walk know don‚Äôt give shit anymore hanging inherently risky now. someone asks better 4 years ago lose shit. industry shambles, city rough shape due pandemic social unrest.

Oh, one coworkers died virus couple people know gotten seriously ill it. scratches surface. never debate college age ""kids"" immune COVID19. means two things. 1) kids spread 2) kids immunity covid start school since lockdown Lockdowns work. obvious. Nobody telling stay home. like murderer wear mask. Cry it. swear none y‚Äôall realize good compared places symptoms means dont know it, spread others, cause someones death. Im essential worker deals crap. idiots like keep spreading it. turned 30, thanks.

- George Carlin, Ultimate American Wait....so saying we'll whole mask thing 100 years? instructions separate tab file. One needs background understand parameters enter. makes perfect sense. Bus usage gone way cities isn‚Äôt often hard socially distanced, restaurant people often intentionally gather right next people (there many people don‚Äôt get someone friend doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre less likely infected stranger). Also mask use higher bus restaurant, buses may open windows ventilation, people average spend much time restaurant. Can't give info keep identity person anonymous?

That said, it‚Äôs possible (although still unknown) that, case flu vaccines, even people get might milder cases they‚Äôve vaccinated. ü§û that? fun never allowed public :) Germans pretty good building Walls too, never forget :) terrible person.

Ok clarify. believe stupid test vaccine make sure safe sign test vaccine stupid.

But ok company making vaccine releasing public without testing it... want guinea pig. 

You sir, special kind stupid. 

Good day. I'm waking like 2.5 hours earlier girlfriend cat moved in. Nothing like hungry cat whining morning get moving feed shuts hell up! authors article smart tie role preventative measures lockdowns specifically. fact matter lockdowns ineffective effective mitigation measure. I'm sure Sweden gets much flak locking countries like Taiwan shown lockdowns way handle COVID. lot people seem holding onto mistakes made March March anymore.  everyone fully expected long time now. plan never fully 100% eradicate world wide handful.of months. unrealistic even think that. places covid free sure all.

The plan buy time overwhelm hospitals develop early treatments done successfully. reason authoritarians continue abusing positions power cause harm good. shocked /s

If couple states fine they're still accepting travel states countries aren't, lull exited population.

Again, I'm expert things learned days leading March 15 ""lockdown"" usa. able learn reading learning virology history virus spreads efforts stop them. Many cause decreased respirations, many epileptic drugs like gabepentin neurontin. Trump lost popular vote....so half technically. I'm getting tired seeing USAmericans comments practically blame Germany monster infecting people. super spreader best go radar hurt many people, yet want ask poor Germany let fight pandemic? Shame commenters.
This Germany's fault; fault evil woman charged bioterrorist. wonder countries world want nothing us.
Edit: corrected typos. could see first wave vaccines 30-60% effective. Unlikely higher that. 

At pace they're going they're trying get something safe somewhat effective stop gap measure. 

The MMR vaccine, effective vaccine 98%, took years develop. Except search based time discussions around vitamin always boosting immune system HELP, tauted cure anywhere saw definitely break mainstream 'cure'.

So, know, either making stuff misremembering lying. good day. guess wait see. I‚Äôm tempering people‚Äôs expectations facts experts. Lots people seem think 100% effective life go back normal vaccinated likely case still super careful. Look IHME. far understand, Oxford vaccine nonprofit, there's money made anyway.

The effective vaccine MMR vaccine 98%. Many flu vaccines 70% effective.

The vaccine generally decrease symptoms get sick, however.  I'll bet mine too. babies young eight months old shown transmit Covid-19 adults outbreaks three childcare centres, according Centres Disease Control findings come schools daycare facilities across country increasingly reopen in-person contact, CDC continuing research guidance controlling spread new report, released late Friday, studied coronavirus outbreaks three childcare facilities, attended 83 kids, Salt Lake City, Utah 1 April 10 July.

 children age 10, likely contracted virus daycare, found infected parents siblings returning home, even showed signs symptoms. 2 comments this. 75% people wore face masks 1/3 wore incorrectly. expect similar results countries first year mass face mask usage.

Secondly change size crowds supprise, hate wearing face mask necessary shopping trips done quickly possible, generally sticking list, leisure shopping happening would expected many people feel same. Almost 200 thousand americans dead. Enough enough. Stupid shit like even considered right now.  No, lawyers forbid it. /s Told propaganda campaign. telling months. science papers started coming 2 years ago. chip makers making LED chips emit 222nm-range UV.  months ago, one made fixtures could buy.  starting change.  quick search today found couple products ceiling-mounted light fixtures, placed ventilation duct.

Do slow infections... part delivering vaccine. /S feel like conspiracy theorists Covid 19 operating confirmation bias; think looking excuse believe it‚Äôs real, don‚Äôt alter lifestyle. 

When find covid conspiracy align with, proof needed it‚Äôs ‚Äúa world-wide conspiracy‚Äù, lax medical community‚Äôs recommendations (because they‚Äôre lying covid, else lying about?). 

It‚Äôs incredibly stupid dangerous, likely driving force behind virus‚Äô continual burn across globe. Frustrating.. address that? monkey trials primarily prevented severe disease prevented retransmission.

This whole story. researchers exposed poor monkeys gigantic doses virus. lot people would exposed to. Phase 2 trials vaccine people showed strong immune response neutralizing antibodies.  conclude that, available literature, predictors pulmonary fibrosis COVID-19 infection advanced age, illness severity, length ICU stay mechanical ventilation, smoking chronic alcoholism. proven effective targeted therapy pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures directed limiting severity disease protecting lungs incidental injuries.

I think they're saying Pulmonary Fibrosis develop Covid-19. point lungs heal (former smokers) morphing Pulmonary Fibrosis fatal diseases e.g. lung cancer, early call ""permanent"" damage. think needless fear-mongering part msm. people recover Covid-19. Yeah live London, I‚Äôm surprised. People going life completely normal, masks aren‚Äôt strictly enforced here. Huge difference NYC came from. Agree, even places US government supposedly responded well covid still clearly enough. look CA, June kinds articles talking success story huge surge. ""Opening quickly"" really part story that, places like SF indoor activities like dining, movie theaters, bars, etc. stayed closed since March still surge summer.

From anecdotal experience, frustrating see completely optional everyone treated guidelines whole time. consistently see like 1/3 people wearing masks everywhere go drive around. I'm sure that's better places, superspreader events we've seen pretty obvious even bad actors infect lot people.

I think criminal charges would reasonable punishment endangering lives clear-cut cases, honestly would go long way start giving $200 ticket anyone wearing mask. Instead we've decided containing covid even less important sorts minor infractions like jay-walking staying parking space long.

I imagine much harm disease + lockdowns caused could averted cared even little bit people actually follow guidelines set up. extremely privileged calling America shit hole. Good God brainwashed idiocy picky recognizing foreign credentials. credentialed professions like nurses teachers highest standards world. 

Professionals educated go anywhere world demand, reverse isn‚Äôt true. Everyone wants say normal nobody wants take crucial steps. think Fauci generous late 2021. would say summer 2022. special brand stupid eat restaurant right now. Well like that's problem mannn... /s jets manufacture middle class falls apart ... Enjoy even question?? heard - would applicable worldwide, Sweden Canada.  Wait hear vaccine approval distributed towards everyone!  Honestly wouldn‚Äôt even problem everyone wearing masks following guidelines. 

Unfortunately, least - visitors (even ones different parts BC) arrive destination go Holiday Mode... them, course... ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want money‚Äù. don‚Äôt want wear mask, won‚Äôt. 

And swear spit poor grocery store clerks stand outside ask wait line 2m apart wear mask use sanitizer, one group allowed store = full-blown Karen attack. 

They go around get restaurant, upset told can‚Äôt seat 6+ group together can‚Äôt bounce around restaurant chatting.


Just smart show prepared, KIND get (and nice, patient understanding respectful individuals interact with, community particular, environment)!

Some disheartening realizations international travel (ok super limited) people courteous kind Canadians. happened us polite kind respectful? want stereotype back please! No, isn't? ridiculous assertion. honestly think things like social distancing universal mask wearing come normal, even widespread vaccine distribution? European languages original. either borrow Latin/Greek, translate literally. Yeah fair enough. Bear mind figure 1 1000 based anything, estimating worst case scenario. biggest reason death rates overall fallen demographic virus currently taking hold of.

With travelling, summer, partying, etc. mostly young, healthy people getting infected.

If infection becomes widely distributed, it'll begin hit vulnerable that's deaths begin pick momentum. Part problem echo chamber paints sociopath.. reacting way even correct.

I know answer, know social media huge part problem. Shocking people trust conspiracy theories science might make wise choices. Exactly.

The one thing governments love war pandemics allows make rules people would otherwise never accept. Ya. Sam Ooster nightmare. delusional detached reality. hear local talk radio time can‚Äôt stand lot people confusing one, seems really ahead curve!

::DOWN LOW:: way! Really? That's impossible dude! telling virus spreads humans!? Fuck outta here! Yeah, money goes drain get blasted every government around world lying something big also public eye much lol. Ain't happening. U know i'll bet hat delayed report schools daycare reopened

‚ÄúThe new report, released late Friday, studied coronavirus outbreaks three childcare facilities, attended 83 kids, Salt Lake City, Utah 1 April 10 July.‚Äù

they data since July thing is, PCR tests, we're talking _38%_ [false even symptoms - also know pretty contagious even _before_ symptom onset. usually, rapid tests gonna much worse PCR tests.

So, decent rapid tests going lot work, they're going allow mass gatherings...and that's thing that's missing, even now. longer stretches people want get back normal, vaccine doesn‚Äôt come 2021 think return normal happen without vaccine. claiming quote article said Fauci article inaccurate?

If quote correct, that's exactly said reasonable person would agree him. fact would claim, never going back normal early 2020 since normal different end this.

Conferences used person may never come back, dining in, shopping habits may change good. see companies allowing remote work nearly year remote working. hoping new normal actually better. every disease condition obvious naked eye? every disease condition produce exactly end result patients regardless age, existing conditions, location, etc? diseases conditions real produce dying streets either? enough cases population prove vaccine. *near 100% survival rate like know looks orange. Actually, thanks quirks electoral college system, half..... 120 Caps per bottle. 2 bottles per package.

Basically grocery cart worth volume ( sarcasm lot )  fact yes, did. Sorry that. definitely wrong friend. Countries northern hemisphere, like Canada, mandate supplementing vitamin foods like milk, yogurt, margarine etc sun's UVB rays simply strong enough produce vitamin endogenously skin. mention winter months, people northern hemisphere get sun covered head toe jackets pants. So, yes, diet supplementation important source vitamin vast number people world. That's way understood it. necessarily restaurant, behaviour going restaurant. sometimes restaurant catch it.  functioning society would punish officials caught betraying public trust, regardless party affiliation. Clearly point time. RIP inbox Thats good resuming provided link describing widespread cheating buying exam scores? took GRE abroad one point test sites look shutdown issue. point foreign students bribe US administrators, parents money much admission talent.

And regardless, whole original point international students often bring talent universities research programs, despite visas put jeopardy president. UK here. We're best back position. i'd say information needed real problem lack empathy.

People lack empathy enemy. conclusion psychologists Nuremberg. case anybody forgotten, quote.  ‚ÄúIn work defendants (at Nuremberg Trails 1945-1949) searching nature evil think come close defining it. lack empathy. It‚Äôs one characteristic connects defendants, genuine incapacity feel fellow men. Evil, think, absence Quotation: Captain G. M. Gilbert, Army psychologist assigned watching defendants Nuremberg trials

It gives way know right wrong. can't agree something, seems like everybody making good points, look person appears lack empathy. person one wrong. person lacks empathy enemy functioning society. Identify expose them. Good luck preventing going public :) ""we foolish Americans,"" hope mean president government. take personal responsibility actions, take responsibility - Americans whole - solution novel virus moment came border. accountable work service community, charge anything could helped US whole. 

To people thread saying KNEW things going like back January: step start calling politicians public health officials act now? many us would listened joined you, disrupting supply chains. perfect. Literally diagnostic test is, even less important COVID/communicable diseases.

If there's thing ""herd immunity"" would also something along lines ""herd testing/isolation.""

Right now, nearly everyone gets infected goes day normally get symptoms. Even symptoms, period ""Is real? need isolate? I'm saying anything anyone unless gets worse want quarantine 2 weeks false alarm.""

So right R0 1, spread pretty linear. imagine happens R0 restrictions plus even \~50% people described get answer question immediately go isolate. Even sensitivity 50%, drive R0 much down. contrast, also open without worrying R0 going 1.

So individually guarantees, whole population could dramatically alter landscape COVID. individual test protects you. everyone's tests protect population whole. mean can't exclude parts Europe hardest hit. Run USA numbers without northeast. What's wrong you, issue Canada? think 1/3 Americans already contracted COVID idea. Thank article!

I got say this: 

Despite everything news, discussions keep safe, even mailers distributed name D. Trump, regularly see patients West Pasco say things like: 

""I know real got sick!""

""I believe news. Everything say blown proportion.""

""It's bacteria, virus. need antibiotic!""

""We thought...we clean. little Johnny got sick play date.""

""I watch news. Joe street told us conspiracy.""

""Trump says flu. read true online.""

Seriously folks, still hear (and more) every day. Last week, fact. Why, why, public listen? doctor tells virus serious, tell mistaken. I'm tired it. lol. point? you‚Äôre liar? easy prove, thanks.  definitely get idea, explain well. Super interesting! Like say, let's see! thanks, want That‚Äôs one way get Ro 1. sure way know. people get symptoms. people get sore throat day headache day.

I sore throat today. one day every month past months wake up. think snoring due gaining weight due lockdown!

What sorry joke :( interesting; nothing else thank food thought. (It's one stew over, sort 'good' response give yet.) There's chance will, extra important flip Senate. would stifle lot damage do, would enable budgets policies pass meant help pandemic. we're looking situation differently, there's use claiming one measure necessary another every single situation. Same, honestly vaccine isn‚Äôt coming late 2021 don‚Äôt care anymore. would rather die ventilator live ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. 70% IPA effective 99% disinfectant versions.

EDIT: also, IPA approved disinfectant. US data: data (US #11 @ 58.98 deaths per 100k pop): GA=59, SC=59, FL=58, NV=48, etc.; higher Europe. barometer handling things better? % People infected % deaths infections(mortality rate)? . Depending thoughts may see Canada much worse actually. Also, Pfizer BioNTech said press release today regarding expansion Phase III stated previously, based current infection rates, companies continue expect conclusive readout efficacy likely end October. That‚Äôs contradiction. We‚Äôre literally living amongst virus now, absolutely need learn live it. learned little faster wouldn‚Äôt quite shit show we‚Äôre now. Learning live responsibly virus still active crucial navigate process makes difference world end thing. personal health, health communities, livelihoods. Post didn‚Äôt say need care humans...just need careful information proceed. 

Every expert weighed prepared foods claims it‚Äôs high risk. eat restaurant enclosed shared spaces. go grocery stores buy food, likely spending way time grocery store would order pay takeout. point is, live it, like go grocery shopping, shop taking precautions, hopefully treat similar risk scenarios keep safe. Trials primates preclinical studies, Phase 1 human study. I'm sure relevant vaccine failed produce sterilizing immunity monkeys seems done humans? We're making vaccines people monkeys... bottom right text might little small. data via partners Urbandroid develop popular sleep tracking app, detail data (and different plots) link there, Florida 7 day running average positive rate 13% time start opening everything up. Masks need mandatory, bars need stay closed, schools need stick remote learning ... cases skyrocket again. please offer example endemic respiratory virus eradicated without vaccines?

Get high horse stop pearl clutching you‚Äôll realise viruses killed humans millions years stomping feet telling everyone ‚Äústay fuck home‚Äù isn‚Äôt going stop that. It‚Äôs tragedy doesn‚Äôt justify destroying society. Deaths today people got month ago. Canada bottomed out. we're seeing increase. Especially Quebec Ontario again. calm last long. Especially schools open 3000 plus cases good news? No, still US citizen. 23 33 cases actually US soldiers. No, scotch tape. Replace ‚Äúcoronavirus rules‚Äù ‚Äúcurrent administration‚Äù headline accurate. Yeah stuff like true. I'd imagine tradeoffs much worth it, especially peace mind. many undocumented. Blaming poor, undocumented exploited workforce get outbreaks. country actually attempted help undocumented and/or poor working-class people, outbreak might look like nordic countries less like...idk, Russia. perfectly trained understand this. think average person understand power viral transmission exponential power explode overnight. 

And understand better various human behaviors react threat. 

Are available help us? Sorry proven time time places like clubs bars never run safely anymore. work single case easily cause super spread like would claim jurisdiction allows irresponsible today. 

I imagine bars hotel lobbies everyone sits shout work safely clubs bars sense people go drinking, dancing work setting. Agreed entirely points. think start making large strides towards normalacy early Q2, large-scale indoor unmasked gatherings (Fauci talking broadway here, example) isn‚Äôt coming back sometime Q3 earliest, maybe Q4. It‚Äôs movement. I‚Äôm Russian spy. lies damned lies it‚Äôs job people government decide it‚Äôs ok lie public deliberately kill people.

Do actual evidence claim? Yes, difference days, actual medical system actual pharmaceutical industry (in couple) actual evidence-based preventative treatments.

Why people always seem ignore fact we‚Äôve three respiratory virus pandemics since 1920? want real comparison point medical system could handle year half two years, look those.

Or don‚Äôt; doesn‚Äôt make ounce difference me. all, it‚Äôs like real influence. almost claims permanent damage based six seven months recovery. Pneumonia alone takes six months recover from.

Anyway yah wondering blue medical ones would ""better"". I've seen lots people wearing reusable masked wonder good are. 
The thing see mask possible accessory, wear medical one would prefer something else, even thought wearing blue disposable one mask (since thin could still breathe fine keep london bike thief cosplay aesthetic lmao) makes absolutely sense whatsoever. vaccines fix, hell many countries dedicating much time resources making one? phase 2 results 3 leading candidates, indication effective are, percent-wise? need 10k+ qualify race days True, cost living lower - least experience. took huge pay cut moved, still save % paycheck every month maintaining standard living.

No, point restaurants didn‚Äôt forever die, conferences didn‚Äôt stop forever, shopping habits came back. changes, said think remote work going much frequent now. restaurants, bars, etc. come back.

Also total tests conducted Pakistan far 2.9 millions. India conducts 1.2 million per day. Majority India's cases asymptomatic minor symptoms.

So yep still fact! 

The whole ‚Äúif can‚Äôt see yet don‚Äôt know tell you‚Äù statement deff attack

You participate division quite obviously Maybe Chinese news article saying spread American China November 2019 right! /s US number 11 world deaths cases per million population. Youre absolutely fucking delusional. Wearing condom sex permenantly staying away everyone two different things. Eventually people going say fuck it, get back normal. Itll end ton excess, unnecessary death, thats whats going happen. Unless virus makes video game like mutation gets insanely deadly incubating weeks, getting back essentially pre-covid normal point, probably within next year two. pretend they're Amazon packages? Problem solved! great job evidence supports belief COVID going distant memory 15 years? people like take judging downvotes, there's reason say wrong all. least America we're still starting line here. uniformed nationally rolled reliable, quick testing. Ditto mask requirements public congregation policies. still mass supplier PPE. 

When take precedent 1918 pandemic barometer see lasted 1920, add fact infinitely interconnected traveling days country still internationally, 2 years seems like safe estimate. 

Anecdotally turned TV recently saw NFL game fans stadium news reports thousands sick still Sturgis rally. 

We consider 2 years success much stupidity here. Mass gatherings going entire time though lol sure we're getting back kind normal, masks social distancing. Irish pubs Ireland pubs - effort Irish. 

The go Ireland and/or America, fun Irish pubs are. Everyone needs realize it‚Äôs time live virus go back life. None us afford that. Learn live risk.  Think it‚Äôs pretty dependent you‚Äôre ordering thing clearly don‚Äôt travel well. drove Uber eats months jobs blown away many people would order eggs diner 20 mins house.

Alas, may same, concessions make order able eat inside restaurant again. figure differ much Friday? source registered regulatory data clinical trial last updated August... IRONIC He‚Äôs known troll promotes coming argue troll skeptic sub. Yes. it‚Äôs going up, it‚Äôs probably *more* 8 deaths, won‚Äôt hear another two weeks. 

It take quite get death certificates even non-pandemic times. US, Brazil India basically uncontrolled spread things look like describe them. Pretty much. Masks required schools they're actually allowed special needs schools. Still glad I‚Äôm short! benefits person academics? feel many teachers hate jobs, specifically feeling related kids directly unions, etc.? skeptical good. fosters conversation discuss determine true likely true. Unfortunately, many ""skeptics"" think referring true skeptics. making arguments based false misleading information support narrative. Others make arguments would call ethical arguments. valuable human life? hard try prevent suffering? certain point people get numb death sickness, inevitable.  Oh see.

Since apparently definition logic, Marcuswhateverthefuckyoucall yourself.

We'll see history proves ""my instinct"" correct, vs. reliance admittedly nuclear fire-storm political hate sides. sides revert increasingly wild claims opponents?

Let's see.... instead ""Trump wrongly blames China"" particular episode history, one ""Trump's working Russia"" dudes?

Or, ""HCQ nothing whatsoever individuals coronavirus, unlike Trump's claims""?

This hate Trump blinding people objective science that's trying REALLY HARD exist here.

Meanwhile, remarked elsewhere thread, China (and countries) continues merry way playing viruses/bacteria/other pathogens ""the greater good"" - whatever fuck means (HOT ZONE, anyone? Anyone?) people close eyes obvious NEEDS CHANGED - kind late Round 1, eh? know get normal college graduation next May I'm gonna lose it. teachers, strike late. unforgivable attack educators young people alike, government going act hand forced. They're testing even less fewer cases back early June. positivity rate horrible.   !remind 30 days think it‚Äôs gonna bit later that. It‚Äôs gonna take time people trust vaccine. say vaccine comes late hear, 1.3 billion doses made end 2021. also say people require 2 doses vaccine effective. would say 2021 generous optimistic date returning normal.

Edit: whoever downvoting new posts lately, motivates bring info sub ... Even then, world big place. Vaccinating might take year more, time, another dose required. unlike SARS, covid present every country, always chance re-emerging cases years. guess nobody predict anything Covid. Hold on, heard one before. r/iamatotalpieceofshit ‚ÄúCyst formation areas airspace disease first noted radiological consequence COVID-19 soon initial outbreak, corroborated studies demonstrating radiological progression areas consolidation bullae [14‚Äì16]. Previous reported cases found cyst formation restricted patients receiving positive pressure ventilation, suggesting barotrauma alone cannot account findings [15]. Likewise, fact report multiple cases pneumothorax patients undergone mechanical ventilation suggests barotrauma alone cannot explain association. Cyst formation also noted late consequence ARDS due SARS, disease processes postulated including ischaemic parenchymal damage inflammation [17].‚Äù

‚Äî

Cyst/bullae formation makes sense, though scary think about. freaky. Unfortunately entertainment companies news departments states. confirming know FedEx customer Amazon's. mean, that's kinda problem along... really hope right, I'm wrong. Honestly. 

But think that's case. Yikes. clearly vet source much, Google searched. Deleting now.

My actual line thinking coming discussion: source follows: rest world thanks sacrifice. Graduated '96, must concur. Well know trial concludes, presumably. I‚Äôm imagining alternate reality 1999 conservatives find every issue politicize cry about. dunno. still operating full awareness HIV, 40 years later? using plenty steroids (the suspected cause joint damage) treat COVID. fact sub can't stop praising steroid use sort miracle breakthrough despite well documented risks. Haha^ manipulated lab, let escaped. tinfoil hat needed. sources besides OP, suggested came lab. mean needs originated man wild.

They used song couple times Community brought back I‚Äôd hear radio drove cousins‚Äô house. Simpler times. think dry ice transportation boxes work pretty much everywhere. total deaths going down, things headed right direction regardless much test don‚Äôt test many Covid deaths hide. Gee, wonder recent motorcyle event 250,000+ people attendance anything spread?

Nah..couldn't be.. /s acknowledge expert knowledgeable take everything says MASSIVE grain salt initially said masks.  It‚Äôs endgame going helpful long run happens ""return normal"" met much higher peak 78k/day back July? deaths go past 2k/days back April? feeling matter hard desire go back normal, rampant death infection would probably grind halt real quick...right? follow excess deaths. aren‚Äôt possible fake unless keep ghosts books.

Why changing subject? I'm talking ""excess deaths.""

Look lack testing correlates drop cases.

All showing Florida testing enough...and actual cases really dropping. Asians big group:
Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Thai, Indian, Bangladeshi, etc.

A lot Asians work service industry. lot Asians janitors, cleaners, etc. 2030? really give shit anyone huh? responsible ever leave home again. Florida man never ceases amaze disgust Many us knew ""kids can't catch - freak nature do, nearly contagious"" total complete bullshit first time told that. obvious reason said get kids back school and/or daycare parents could go back work juice economy back up. 

OF COURSE kids catch it, easily easily adults. Kids catch ANYTHING, usually orders magnitude often adults. there's nothing magical kid makes him/her less contagious living, breathing homo sapiens.

Just another thing LONG line BS .gov spewed COVID. Imagine much better whole country would they'd HONEST us day one . There's thought.. least stock market! recently dipping pretty sharply.  Comment month! meant sick point death possibility. ""2.5%"" sounds like reference vulnerable age group, 2.5% Americans would die this. Depends entirely then. premed student one top 25 universities country lot stressed 27, making decent living much less stress then. spreading incorrect information. vaccine 50% effective, cut chance getting virus 50%. cuts chance *much more* 50%. V shaped recovery!!! don‚Äôt see dangerous putting kids back school. weak. Theres large group - especially older - go go restaurants. want excuse continue nothing day feel good it. Yeah last models grossly in-accurate caused needless fear thanks fear mongering  American, find blatant use facts affront unexamined retrograde notions patriotism.

New Zealand island locked early enough get eliminated within weeks, prevent spread immigration tight border controls. 

Vietnam complicated explain, admit, also described dictatorship, also locked early, huge destination illegal immigrants, except China also control.

Western democracies lockdown early enough like New Zealand probably lost chance eliminate virus. populations democratic societies accept lockdowns long. Impressive willfully ignorant achieve given chance. Ya, Pfizer/Biontech great data distribution extremely complicated that. maintained -70¬∞ F. Every country planet least 95% back normal June 2021. Screenshot this. NPR poll highlights staggering level economic distress facing United States population result pandemic &amp; lockdown, nearly half Americans reporting serious financial trouble.

Trump suggested testing notion 'maybe something like bringing light body' - testing ensure enter one's body without damaging stuff inside otherwise directed light goes body would damage cells inside body...   they're talking population would die. know that's wrong. 60 million people already Try living Germany, political leader Ph.D Quantum Chemistry.

Around here, numbers mean things happily shuts experts speaking. 1000 die day US faking it? Two days?? WTF? kind trend that?

Someone reporting office could taken day off, resulting delayed results. 

This means nothing all. Incredibly lazy 'journalism'. Mask, course! knew powerful thoughts reality really works know fear worst possible thing operate push onto others. lie. crappy goal put cause fear around. Lying answer. seems doubtful. Yang get speak Dem Natl Convention? media say nothing since shock affect. much much much easier contain contact tracing. called virus suppression much better approach health economy mitigation. conspiracy think shut ins introverts loving year want think continue indefinitely? Nah. Compare 7-day case averages April compared August. compare deaths. 

Save post I'll eat words I'm wrong: 7-day moving average covid deaths *never* high April 2020.  I'm certainly going take rushed, politicized vaccine. German press reporting patient previously undiagnosed MS unrelated vaccine: Highly underated comment. r/semisonic ? u/some_where_else needs refresher exponential growth ;) They're talking percent population COULD get really sick infected, already been. Obviously people know risk taking precautions.

That quote incredibly fucked though. factors involved shutdown that. Yep, American's selfish. Never think currently Orange County Jail bond set $30,000, according jail records.

That seems like pretty low amount act like this. assume talking dirty pictures. friend two years posted. guys, water wet. Bryan Challehan ever spell comedian accused rape.

Seems like stretch though. Well, good news thousands jets parked airports holding fields world.

This is, however, misleading article headline. Assuming 7.8 billion doses available (impossible), plane used (stupid), true. Otherwise no.

A much better article would point scaling vaccine 7.8 billion doses highly complex exercise production logistics. good article would also research compare scale effort required produce annual flu vaccines widely available.

But, alas, provocative headline much easier write well-conceived researched article genuinely informs people. 
I appreciate providing source, wow, site dishonest fuck. use was.


It consistently takes nursing home deaths. yes, count people likely die, IFR look better.

but mean overall IFR actually .5 .3.

To put another way, math agreed used total dead exclude half dead nursing homes.

If want math exclude half deaths sources IFR do, IFR .2 actually lower even ""optimistic"" sources.

Some foreigners entering Vietnam commercial flights resumed month required undergo centralized quarantine five seven days.

Vietnam expected resume commercial flights Hanoi Ho Chi Minh City Guangzhou, Japan, South Korea Taiwan September 15, Laos Cambodia starting September 22.

Around 20,000 passengers scheduled arrive country month, Government Office Chief Mai Tien Dung said meeting Friday.

Passengers would include Vietnamese citizens, foreigners carrying diplomatic official passports, experts, managers, high-skilled workers, investors, family members. flights opened tourists yet.

Under Transport Ministry's proposal, would two weekly round trips HCMC-Guangzhou route, two weekly services Hanoi-Tokyo HCMC-Tokyo routes well four trips Hanoi HCMC Seoul, four weekly trips Taipei.

Dung said passengers must furnish certificate showing tested negative novel coronavirus within five days boarding flight. Upon landing Vietnam, would undergo centralized quarantine five seven days would tested Covid-19 twice using real-time reverse transcription‚Äìpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Those reporting negative results would remain home place work complete 14-day quarantine period per health ministry protocol supervision local authorities. showing signs infection continue centralized quarantine.

Since Covid-19 pandemic broke Vietnam last January, country required coming abroad quarantined centralized facilities 14 days.


Foreign passengers, including Vietnamese returning abroad would pay quarantine testing expenses. Costs PCR testing Vietnam proposed VND 1.2 million ($52) per person.

During stay, passengers required install Bluezone, Bluetooth-based app helps determine person come close contact Covid-19 patient.

At meeting, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said Vietnam brought second outbreak Covid-19 pandemic control since country experienced eight clean days without new domestic infections.

""It must ensured foreign arrivals cause new outbreaks,"" Phuc stressed.

Vietnam suspended international flights March 25. Many foreigners kept country due travel restrictions pleaded government reopen borders resume international flights could reunite families.

The country recorded 1,059 Covid-19 cases, 128 remain active. far, 35 people succumbed pandemic, many elderly patients suffering underlying conditions like diabetes and/or kidney failure. can't fully lockdown, fully open fully lockdown every months expect people comply - rightly so

It makes perfect sense lockdown areas covid spreading, keeping rest country running. Australia good example. actually enforced lockdown couple apartment blocks rather whole Melbourne. sucks people living apartments, especially bits Australian government sending pork Muslims, rest Melbourne went business. way things? really. 2 weeks ago 7-day moving average deaths 900s. 700s. That's improvement despite one day higher. likely die catch corona, get narcolepsy vaccine.

Swine flu deadly unacceptable risk get immunity it. Ah, reinfection? ;) he? doubts old grandpa enough bite anything free use instant messaging services... ""were"" ready, ""was"" ready. He's dumb painful. 

These armchair morons really think know better PhDs MDs Better Brazil, [and Spain, Italy, Belgium, Corona time guarantee even Trump wins ain't seeing 4 years this. way NY prosecutors serious investigations find crimes Trump committed. can't pardoned, there's nothing stopping prosecutors saying Trump accused commiting x,y,z crimes. Let's see Republicans keep Trump President he's waiting indicted. mean data pretty clear people condcuted lockdown. People Soutern Europe, even severe time lax social movements. statistics really lie. speak cases brought summer (because caseload pretty well managed), seems brought form people visiting families southern countries (namely Balkans) people going South party (namely Spain). understand sight people seemingly living pretty carelessly gathering riverbanks seems like hybris, simply lucky gathering really cause infection waves summer outdoor gatherings (people still stay withing particular group came usually 20 people outdoor setting, much commonly way less). trying speak countries Southern Europe way problems. would explanation be?   Last night spent time engaged Twitter argument wearing masks. know expected...you can't really argue people. amount misinformation regurgitated back astounding, depressing, infuriating. people tired dealing coronavirus? know am! they're insistent helping drag long possible... better job avoiding another Trump someone radical would actually chance get Congress Biden. Well, state never mask order governor threatening revoke teaching licenses schools try teach remotely. either sidelined forced kiss Trump‚Äôs ass. thank you. better job.  Hospitalizations going London. know You‚Äôre legit denial. Look last 7 day average compare week August July less. Fucking moron. Depends referring to. There's good chance portion patients lasting damage like lung scarring mild functional impairment. time, patient cohort average age 61 half smoking history. 12 weeks there's still high rate recovery. SARS-1 lung studies said recovery happens within first 1-2 years. Christ whole side dumb exhausting ""American's can't cope minor inconveniences"" causing spikes COVID cases, fault France case per capita US?

Fucked know. honest keeping news France. far covid concerned, Italy news months ago. Perhaps poor working class people marginalized, exposed, losing everything, told ""deal it"" wealthy politicans corporations?

That absolutely happening USA. probably France. ultra-wealthy nation, really. allegiance profit.

And long safe, really give fuck rest us. Ditto.

My wife today realized families taking seriously. cramped mother's condo is, way I'm going bunch kids go crazy anyway.

My kids (at least older one) thrilled Christmas year, she'll survive it. wife I.

Sounds like brother law staying us Christmas. He's quarantined (we take lot walks get out, though fall/winter going shit pretty hard), I'm worried anything there. Id say misguided think new directly started conflict (the average Serian would disagree) means anything ware stepping bombing 
its like Chinese Whispers. engagement critical thinking. every time something repeated mistake creeps in. Ok. I'll play! right. average Serbian would disagree. like adults see then. spend day room yesterday someone left nose uncovered half time also mouth uncovered. runs business high risk exposure, fun me. edit add - I‚Äôm pissed business shut down. pissed lifted order soon allowing Covid get completely control. 

How Trump Administration handled crisis going cause severe financial distress years - economic pain felt yet. 

If wondering know - owned business 20 years successfully MBA. fucked. Yeah, it‚Äôs strange implications. tell chiropractor disc causing nerve pain real. 

A good chiropractor always electric stimulus ice help muscle spasms. go turn burn chop shop sure is. bro don‚Äôt get wearing mask patriotic bro bro!  Please explain person needs therapy?

Because seem believe social distancing permanent feature humanity. obvious? Ah, nice. :): anxiety hypochondria much likely Well hope summer tourism money worth it. One bubbles invite 10 people over? truth nobody really get down, long people allowed even resemblance normal life.

Here CZ daily infection numbers went 400 1450 five days...  I'm young too, mom got diagnosed stage 3 cancer starts chemo soon. gets COVID, she'll die. US totals adjusted population.

The 57 68 pandemics killed 1-4 million people adjusted population 2020 would 3-10 million deaths. 

1918 Spanish flu adjusted population 105-350 million deaths.


But speaking US adjusted population think past 67 flu little behind 57 flu. ü¶†idiots school area 1%

Have 70% kids going person already two cases three days. I'm guessing know about. 

I can't even imagine fucking nuts must double digit states. Says dispshit who's pretending care people, done ignore piles bodies way worse sicknesses. I'd love become teacher, except small fact can't stand kids  lost around 300 first responders 9/11. right, *huge* waste time money.  I'm glad get reference live make believe world. 

What‚Äôs made up? Trump called racist banning travel place Wu flu started?

Nancy holding fucking block party China town?

Donald lowest minority unemployment EVER?

All real friend. 

Read weep guess. that‚Äôs sad would root US. Lies. try trim American Eagles feathers. separated thousand kids lost belong to... know brown right? 

/s obviously üôÑ makes huge amount money popular, hardly waste time Many children caught virus. like cold. perfectly healthy get virus suffer major complications. similar Kowasocki disease. recover die. Pretty much like many cases healthy people get die it. heard rumors certain blood types cause age groups get worse others. sure case not. can't right click phone So, use exhale valve - can't closed?. not, cover duct tape filter whatever. get one without valve. could control like US. could literally make illegal quarantine people bring groceries people can't get delivered. could even close takeout places, freeze rent/mortgage/loan payments, pay everyone $2000 month UBI. months, open mostly back again, would've cost significantly less shitshow we're endure. danuel house? Tories gotta keep economy going costs thing governors ignored guidelines part. 

I‚Äôm fan Trump, deserves rot handled this, plenty rot him. even fucking American.

Yeah, guessed Russian. cool story Vlad Well, shit. goes timeshare week Myrtle Beach next month. I'm glad buy plane tickets. Fuck then, yolo. Go want.

The rest us spend next 10-20 years rebuilding people mindset wrecked. Dieing least peoples worries this. Even mild case severely mess organs cripple life. Well... good see favorite state making news almost much Florida nowadays, guess... move Canada, I‚Äôm taking money business - and, I‚Äôll happily stay Canada me. 

Canadians actually freedom travel - don‚Äôt think many countries going allow Americans back time soon. 

So - Canada sounds great would free.

And, don‚Äôt mind paying taxes giving charities. parts normal citizen democracy. friends 6 year old understands quarantine means. wonder much parents 'donate' get college. much think trump bungled fuck this, task force put clear easy follow guidelines. 

90% governors ignored outright.

Further. Many Americans ignored individual level guidelines outright. 

There‚Äôs plenty blame go around. trusting science

That's hot take bruv  Well, want go semantic joke... Already believed lockdown policies weren‚Äôt merely ineffective, detrimental larger scheme things  don‚Äôt know either, I‚Äôm citing scientists dr‚Äôs claim number. ‚ÄúNot impressive‚Äù gawd modern day Jonas Salk. god haven‚Äôt corona task force wits yours? Yup, course online delivery many possible avoid grocery store too. Apparently anything published Western source count. story initial warnings unknown infectious respiratory illness first noticed Wuhan Chinese media. something still can't pass.... That's wrong. know sure yet, evidence worrying. We're seeing multiple studies showing significant portion hospitalized patients issues months later. Surveys people mild cases also reporting lingering symptoms. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs worked Australia too. would absolutely still take vaccine proved efficacious even say 1 1,000 chance problem like this. think people willing take risk still able get vaccine. realize think kind fake bullshit, September still think temp check door enough?

like honestly fuck  compelling rebuttal literally *locked* campus, might point

but they're totally going go home weekend, fall break/thanksgiving, christmas. ‚ÄúThe N95-rated face mask exhale valve used study small amount exhaled droplets escaped gap top mask bridge nose. Moreover, exhalation port significantly reduced effectiveness mask means source control, large number droplets passed valve unfiltered unhindered.‚Äù Ha! let bad guys win bad guys ‚Äúless violent‚Äù power? 

That makes zero sense democracy. voters decide. hope aren‚Äôt idiots like you. don‚Äôt think know herd immunity threshold yet. I‚Äôve seen figures low 50%-60%. 

And don‚Äôt know much population infected, especially didn‚Äôt sufficient testing first wave. could approach figure within two years. agree. remember vaguely thinking ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good‚Äù couple times. what? don‚Äôt remember now. seems method keeping us dazed confused work well. You‚Äôre right though, little good outweighed massive amount bad corruption lies. bet something like quarter kids already DUI.

So that's standard operating on, makes total sense. article ways pandemic ends.

1) burns naturally.

2) vaccine effective treatment.

3) People say ""fuck it, we're anymore.""

Most likely messy combination 3.  insanely ironic vocal ""We going distance forever!"" making maybe best argument possible people stop anything get infected. Please explain person needs therapy? also, please reference pandemics since 1918 2x deadly one (that 8 mos).

2009 H1N1 US: 60.8 million cases, 12,469 deaths.151,700-575,400 worldwide 

1968 H3N2 US: 100,000 deaths, 1 million worldwide

2020 Cov-19 US: 6.576 million cases, 196,000 dead US (as today) 900,000+ worldwide (in 3/4 calender year)

Neither past 2 pandemics even close comparison deadly US alone 8 months. Maybe get advice pandemics actual doctors, therapists help feelings, know absolutely fuck virology

also therapist can't help emotional damage, fire them. that's literally job hope youre one.  suspect many business owners mad governors shut down. really think reason many taking seriously Trump called virus hoax months refused advocate mask wearing summer?

He chief executive country. supposed leading us. inaction dumbassery leading many people getting sick would otherwise surprised millions deaths US said done, hospitals overwhelmed such. thing happening last months more? Fauci confusing public. stop talking media assumptions

vaccine works, vaccine may work, vaccine may ready.... Fauci shut mouth wants pandemic end work moderate COVID patients, course hospitals want throw them. well, got lucky would possible get job quicker attractive candidate.   Nah, Brad Pitt already role locked down. rational person wasted entire summer away, 5 weeks (the I've ever gotten) felt like everyone knew going vacation. booked thanksgiving xmas tickets home yesterday. boss flown 3 hour flights 2 times month come it. Even though know real I'm starting wonder really bad. relocate there?  Except ""ItS GoInG fOrEvEr!!!"" crowd deniers whiners thought 1 week ""lockdowns"" people found ""essential"" ""fOrEvEr""


But let's parse words county health doctor Arkansas pretend he's leader CDC announcing carefully crafted plan world follow. It‚Äôs Americans fucking idiots comes listening science.  guess Disneyland doesn‚Äôt get message trying reopen soon. Newsom ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù? Disney reopen kinda shitty tbh it‚Äôs Disney all. add numbers confirmed + probable. much winning.  Maybe don‚Äôt lie first time around. dunno hire people violence issues can‚Äôt pass background screening General populace, larger test case basis, nothing easily covered something corner cut political reasons. I'm sure Fauci aware metrics some. Actually see article mention anything whether he's claiming situation better worse today past. seems saying realistic thing point would get spread sort controllable level (10k cases day, thinks) tread water next several months vaccine becomes widely available. he's disappointed can't seem get anywhere near 10k/day. things considered think that's pretty reasonable opinion attitude have. 

By way, right numbers hard really conclude anything those. true early days initial spike country, like 20%+ positive, today 5%. think PROBABLY indicates reality way, way daily cases time (also supported death counts), testing damn little (especially across country large) hard really know anything data. depressed Wow. full purchased two things, one consumed election night winner becomes evident.  
   
The first sparkling cider it‚Äôs favorite drink, better anything alcoholic makes think thanksgiving growing family.  
The second bomber beer called ‚ÄúLe Fin Du Monde‚Äù idea exactly, drinking necessary followed closely seriously exploring expat options.  
  
It‚Äôs good time American. Trump repeated yesterday seen thousands fact checkers saying true. not? Given US never locked down, it‚Äôs unclear point is. Swedes smarter Americans? Fuck yes. better healthcare? Fuck yes. clear, Rob Ford opposing party, he's conservative populist sketchy record, many compare Trump himself. pretty simple: yesterday SC reported total 126,592 cases. Today reported total 129,046. means change cumulative total 2,454, largest one-day change cumulative number reported. organizations tracking numbers base daily reported cases, number new cases within past 24 hours. backlog cleared, come newly reported cases, that's amount cumulative case count changed by. Oh yeah! Nebraska state! behind paywall, could please elaborate why? Wednesday reported experiencing 'testing fatigue' whatever means. citizens government dumb fuck  get UBI, come universal healthcare really matter. people get UBI spent healthcare, UBI really missing point. Basically, insurance companies stopped preying us anymore. Vote. 

Make everyone know vote. Make want vote, make want make friends vote.

You say say it.

This sticks mind: ""If vote really opinion can't upset result""

Please, vote.

(I'm sure will, others need also!) Remember ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù strategy? Well did. kept almost hospitals overwhelmed. deaths trending since slowly started going back normal since March, seems safe say continue so, least shows sign going capacity health care system time soon.

But every time announce new normalcy, people insist calling person grandma killer, nobody wants person. considering American cops act lack training already seem bottom barrel... get worse?  also pretty dishonest. hand waves away hospitalization, vast majority ""sources"" mention hospitalizations. borderline propaganda. That's good know. can't go see family, can't go Canada, can't work job (laid due Covid), least grab takeout. Thanks, stay safe. mean sincerely - thank doing. countries better US. don‚Äôt disagree there. feel like US gets disproportionate amount hate they‚Äôve handled compared say, France Spain, who‚Äôs cases back rise.  I‚Äôll check out! Joe Normies Like Us podcast made connection made total sense me! suffocating :/ want live country proud see progress. Unlike US taken notable steps backwards recent years. One reasons study hard school right possibility moving abroad. Kinda wishful fantasy. **Sep. 12, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

My dad almost 70. went doctors one day wearing N95 valve (these N95s could find) told TAKE put stupid cloth slobber shield pulling ears forward. even regular surgical mask could placed top it.

They course mentioned ""protect wearer well"" mask ""for healthcare workers"". told mask, VALVE IT, healthcare workers, wear it. REALLY??????

If pandemic isn‚Äôt going away need valveless N95s learn live virus. national plan enforceable rules absolute imperative epidemiologists data shows us least two years.

The Left - Right stuff doesn‚Äôt belong public health. get pandering wedging both. Look Covid long haul ""No sir I'm Hudson, he's Hicks."" [He changed nothing long run. 

But meant was, lax mask measures re-opening often viewed ""Republican,"" strict mask measures shutdowns often viewed ""Democrat."" That's obvious oversimplification, get idea.  Wtf LOL dont watch Fox genius brainwashed Democrat propaganda want alarm you. occurs fascism fully sets within first year country typically goes conquest binge. Think Hitler Poland.

Canada Mexico prime expansion points. Mexico much better target, Canada valuable.... dude, stupid #CCP knew least 1/3 patients market.


so like 2/3 patients market coincidence, seems legit.

If youre really, really committed believing conspiracy already.

smh, really can't believe someone thought good argument. Sad, football many Americans look forward I‚Äôve seen Facebook post, supposedly written expert, claimed transmission child yet documented. gist child transmission didn‚Äôt happen. Daycare person probably saw post, similar. school students see friends family slowly pass away get seriously ill due disease choice

I'm school choice. choose go live life happily. dont even know anyone who's gotten Corona win Porque los dos? Agree confirmed certain party escalated official soon found current minion would lying public save lives. Excellent post contribution: mods overreact removing due edited title? Worldmeter got numbers SCDHEC. See reply. living relatively normal lives already.

Not true Except every scientist agrees president denys it. Apparently Sweden less movement neighbours (which similarly unaffected virus right - rather less deaths). shocking number people already died Spain - many needed reach 'herd immunity'? personally consider shutting things least partial lockdown. You‚Äôre cutting access things otherwise would open. words, water wet sky blue. 12 weeks still feels like long time sick, especially population used sick two three weeks most. Wish info 50% still recovered. Better keeping cages guess.  weird I‚Äôm speaking Colorado guessing others. COs site report daily new cases separate column ‚Äúcases added previous reported date‚Äù worldmeters combined daily report. They‚Äôre still go data though Spring break half year away yet. cancel things far out? Oh yeah don‚Äôt usually look sub bad news ima honest. Sorry bad tho wrong country. still agree countries better US least acknowledging problem. No, numbers article great. low numbers across board. great way know knock friends list though. realize machine. :) Another reason wear mask. apocalypse, even close. closest disease came black death. Black death killed 60% europes population destroyed feudalism system.

COVID tragedy cautionary tale mishandling pandemic, way apocalypse local state national, matter policy set deal pandemic, viewed lens Democrat Republican.

No, fuck sides bullshit. Trump came tomorrow endorsed nationwide mask mandate reaction Democrats would wonder fuck would suddenly pull head ass. ate bullshit Corbin antisemite. many times need say individual days meaningless? Look weeks want trends. Except miss IFR coronavirus actually quite low, **and probably much lower earlier year due better treatments**. Okay yeah everyone rich parents working home supervise kids laptops &amp; internet access. kids households poor, school lunches sometimes meal day. kids single parents working essential jobs can‚Äôt stay home day make sure school. don‚Äôt even internet access. friends mom teacher said class 25 7 showed online class like 3 actually finished work last year everything shut down. Kids really going behind educational social development this. think help people get notification they've contact someone tested positive actually go isolation directed. However worry many people ignore (but hope I'm wrong). know make clearer major peak summer months article commenting envisions future U.S. COVID-19 outbreak, Fauci told Harvard session: ""I talk second surges we're still first surge. went way down.""

You're still 1000 deaths day. 1000. going away magically one U.S. heads fall, likely uptick COVID-19 cases people tend congregate indoors more, said. ""I think need hunker get fall winter going easy.""

Oh holy shit..it's almost he's saying exact thing I've saying thinking downward trend line would continue fall/winter savagely stupid? Almost like people know look forward possible oncoming risk look 1 week trend line go ""ok guess jobs done""?

Anyway, I'll let get back stocking Spirit Halloween ""Don't wear masks""

""I told so""

Yeah work it. Sounds right What‚Äôs Biden gets Covid 1st debate? Yes, unfortunately. want everyone know it. Cheerleader, Coach. I've always seen cruises this, definitely changing minds pandemic. Especially decision. Individuals intentionally cough essential workers welded house. essential worker gets sick dies it, house arrest permanent. Good thing unread books. say order three books. Closed border how? asking returning citizen nicely stay home 14 days nicely? Nice!! America haven‚Äôt given stimulus since March  think recent change rate growth gives UK anything crow given first six months, evidently disastrous US.  btw - according stats I'm seeing, mortality rate per case UK 11.4%, US 21.9%.   - nothing crow about. kind information? Floating tub full dipshits. september 11th pretty good comparison imo. Rule 1: Find chick obsessed coronavirus. Closed border how? asking returning citizen nicely stay home 14 days nicely? Nope. They're actually pretty strict. Sure did. Anything keep fear going.  poor people scare shit middle class. Paraphrasing George Carlin  That‚Äôs ton deaths smaller state. Edited. TY! hate country. :( Looks like came US Base. clear, stationed there, visits one. saying is:

""After vaccine, take year herd immunity makes attending theater without mask safe.""

What saying is:

""After vaccine, people irresponsible morons immediately ditch masks.""

Those two statements contradiction. kids uniform laptop time every class reported tardy.

They teachers classrooms empty school students Microsoft Teams laptops. teacher see kids kids also see eachother. also use interactive software college online real-time learning.

Most families parent work working home right now.

People taking staying home seriously contributing tens thousands deaths across country. Looks one ""today learned"" moments üòä though maybe could closed anything *except* freight. doubt easy that. Boomers hate parents much joined team dad shooting at. doooomer masturbation post? death cult Suicides make 2/3rds gun deaths Lots redditMDs scoffing idea lungs ever permanent damage 

Actually, anything sub full people decrying everybody ever covid turn blind, lame breath forevah! Yet new cases spiking schools reopening.  don‚Äôt need many tests many fewer infections, don‚Äôt guys understand that? don‚Äôt contact testing contact, obvious. clear, person something gain people going gym, mean safe go there. Looks like carry freight:

_""In 2017, rail services carried 10.3 million passengers 1.22 million tonnes freight, Shuttle carried 10.4 million passengers, 2.6 million cars, 51,000 coaches, 1.6 million lorries (equivalent 21.3 million tonnes freight)""_

I mean yeah right though, could closed technically. Somehow though lot lorries drivers shuttle back forth UK continent everyday otherwise basically starve live baked beans (I'm exaggerating course). appropriate satisfied rising numbers viral infractions schools even resumed operation? frightening numbers increasing steadily model based previous rate increase along data places already opened school up, recipe rapid rise unnecessary infection death. appear concept percentage backwards. It‚Äôs converting number percentage multiply 100, way around. So, example, 0.003 translates 0.3%. 0.03 translates 3%. on.  they‚Äôre close proximity masked? would thought... mean, right issue people questioning much.

Just wear god damn mask stay fuck home, matter understand it.  need infrastructure war mask keep basic sanitation. People stupid American virus spreading across world. Same? No. history culture rest it.  going Easter, though...maybe 2021?  4 months battle virus still people believe flu... Ah! learned something new today! Nice! read report family mother, father, grandparent died Covid two teenage children pretty much own. link anymore, though. sinking feeling this... sick influenza, life-threatening. developed me/cfs. 9 years in, baby! 0/10 recommend. I‚Äôm mostly housebound. wait, moves slowly country. First America stock PPE time, federal government told people wear mask. CDC advised people wear cloth face covering. states started requiring cloth face coverings. CDC recommends non medical masks. 

If vaccine trials fall enough vaccine production capability within 6 months (almost guarantee), we'll see guidance start issued filtration masks along American companies starting sell them. 

Everything moves pace snail country, least easy ahead curve though.

Like anything, testing reveals what's there, that's testing, officially identify cases. statistic purposes, data gatherers going take someone thinks official statistic. would really sloppy data gathering.

You right, majority cases mild asymptomatic.

How fuck anybody that's party right now. depends. wanna DIE? Starbucks away. Recently petition MP decriminalise magic mushrooms got 14k signatures, think psychedelics would probably also decriminalised years (in practice, police provinces already treat shrooms like weed decade back i.e. turn blind eye unless you‚Äôre something blatantly stupid it). I‚Äôm proud sensible Canada issue. Anti mask rallies popping Europe moment too. 

The US, oddly enough, seems one major western countries cases actively falling. UK additional measures taken due spread. Spain new cases per day beginning, we've cancel holiday Portugal France due border closures. still alive resume normal teaching vaccine. ever rumor TM anyway, right? myelitis possible complication adenovirus infection believe probably caused drastic response first identified.

I think also possible complication COVID-19/SARS-COV2 infection. heard superspreader event Korean starbucks? may rare, happen drinking macchiatto unmasked. much safer sit outside. They'll definately get it.  Oops I've thought thing. literally fantasize getting vaccinated lol update timeline vaccine? Exactly. fuck? really hope you‚Äôre right 11/6/21 supposed wedding day (if everything safe) would tell that? still shows excess deaths occurring unless referring graph I'm missing? (There incomplete weeks end graph click them. counts go reporting complete, happened past.) NYT interactive map excess deaths summer recently. significant US whole many states. 

I'm sure CDC data 100% accurate anyway. CDC muddling lots data. Deaths US peak possibly now, cases, hospitalizations, spread still pose concerns many areas excess deaths still pose concerns areas. constantly changing hot spots, US solid Covid containment yet. consensus independent experts determines metrics health crisis either ended globally US negligibly impacted ready strongly contain outbreaks occur (think New Zealand), that's meaningful. 

In area, hospitalizations pre-pandemic levels though, we're publicized particular hot spot. Spread still meaningful. 

Deaths lag data lags NYT recently published data excess deaths August still significant. heard controversy CDC trying muddle death toll they've tried muddle get tested school parameters. pandemic over. know it'll end vaccine combination things, think anyone creating recreational contacts pandemic irresponsible unless nation strong enough containment response plan. US not. Fauci warned lifting restrictions interview days ago. Yea lol reddit complains much Sure, get vaccine. service world proud.

There little sign wear says ""I vaccinated disease free!"" someone sees without mask give grin thumbs-up instead glaring unsafe. Leave ego door. 

Just check stats - deaths, hospital admissions etc. mashallah pointed downwards since June. surprise government experts. Well even many parts US things better normal April-June. Hospitals efficiently treating it, businesses figuring open without causing outbreaks, we're already getting better this. Keep mind, lot people paid so. case like usually triggers immediate review data far ensure nothing like seen yet patients. assume vigilant type SAE future too. is. saw post earlier ""American"" said ok rest world discriminate American due this.

Weve locked hard here, sent economy shambles, allowed live lives whole spring ""to protect elders"". Yeah, granpa died month ago. Heart failure, covid related. grandma died two weeks ago lingering brink death 6 months almost fatal stroke. covid related. fucked everything everyone saved two well covid... died weeks that. Thats trade century really. wouldn't. really depends crowded there's mask-wearing. happened Korea recently. Yep summed perfectly Seriously. take care little cousin and.... see posts places played soccer games one three teams seemed started back last week half. futsal short field soccer included jam packed, nearly pandemic started last night. 

I baffled. Shook. Angry. Disappointed people.

It pains see little kids fun soccer field little cousin loves. it‚Äôs right call... we‚Äôre making he‚Äôs gone stir fry, think we‚Äôre well. Still practicing keeping soccer skills sharp it‚Äôs actually dumb fucking decision start playing again; which, think isn‚Äôt many months efficacious vaccine.

Also, shout parties block. üò§ mean yeah seems extremely reasonable... anybody think otherwise?  Could 100000 different things. signs adverse reaction trial halted. Could runny nose, headache etc. people trial closely monitored Paris doomed. way stop without starting restrictions, moment like covid, everything opened ppl put masks useless wear could utility. least everything less stuffed like also tourist least. past couple years decided minority party &amp; foreign influence, that's close toi voice ""over half them"". Keep eating chum vocal minority.  nationwide nurse shortage 15 years. get it. I‚Äôm bummed can‚Äôt pay $800 month anymore rely grandparents manage multiple apps zoom logins everything else comes online learning. know fortunate willing grandparents help. work health insurance benefits, staying home unemployment great lasted it‚Äôs sustainable lucky enough get job yesterday offers benefits! wish made enough money send back private school feel like failing him. educated teacher neither grandparents. educated, graduated college, teaching experience feel bad kids trying distance learn. Yes. Outdoor transmission negligible. anyone concerns easily wear mask keep distance. Fake news. know anybody died personally? another flu. Political hit job, it'll disappear Nov. Blah blah blah. Honestly, think comes ""how brought up"". parents teach us moral values? teachers? television films exposed to? 

I brought two artists, dyed-in-the wool Democrats, Catholics Liberals. witnessed Black Beautiful movement. Vietnam War.

 horrified newspapers found grandmother's closet WWII. peppered hate Asians, much began notice ""harmless cartoons"" like Bugs Bunny sewing seeds racial tension. grandmother cursed influx Italian families predominantly Irish community. called names repeat. 

Thank God television series like *Star Trek*, despite flaws, managed open mind clearer way thinking. 

I cannot imagine confusion young minds today attempt navigate much desparaging media, ""reality shows"", Internet, even horribly biased evening news. Walter Cronkite would stood that. 

How rectify this? Deaths lag weeks behind cases.

The young currently main carriers too, though reported elderly creeping infection counts. 

Scotland's r rate currently 1.1 1.5. highest uk.

Do nothing deaths going go back April levels. think remote work thing true. isn‚Äôt first pandemic. 100 years ago pandemic. followed roaring 20s. Ok Halloween! Excellent üëåüôèüëçüëèüëèüëè opinion, friends family refusing act best interests. realize lot people might trust vaccines either, vaccines people getting right thing everyone going get gets one. Anyone reads results far see that. They'll also see safe public gets them. really rare really bad adverse reactions, enough people injected either show road rare enough remain hidden trials.

There's point waiting right now, least someone wants over, fears virus, hates wearing mask, etc. know many people impacted? 1 probably/obviously outlier good idea pause consult others cover ass plus avoid seeming irresponsible. recently stopped using Quest diagnostics, it‚Äôs Florida Florida. always thought too, one could possibly properly pick produce me. using instacart months abundantly pleased, couple minor hiccups. 

I understand aspect enjoying process grocery shopping. used really enjoy well.  largely they're reserving PCR tests symptoms, who've close contact positives. Also large commercial labs swamped bulk orders private employers like factories distribution centers implementing regular testing staff. harsh reality PCR testing time &amp; resource intensive. difficult scale test whole communities private sector re-opening. knew media shit, realize extent pandemic. really disgusting disingenuous, inaccurate, unhelpful media throughout this. get brain surgery done butcher put tea seller ( unsuited) position PM. 

That temple weird stuff. people clamour stuff probably arent religious proper way ( go temple daily yada yada) get boner identity politics good sick leave benefits sustainable economy. 

- fund health care system pay much operation. like system, designed fund 10 x people sick leave time. want system go dept around half people corona quarantine could well home office. 

And coronavirus, usual 3 days without paid (on sick leave usually paid starting third day). even expensive.

- company workers half time work. really hard production evenmore essential workers. 

Also, part social security paid company top health benefits even expensive them. 

Sorry long paragraph, thought interesting question. People realizing Covid-19 end world, fact much worse serious flu compared things people tend die from. Total global Covid deaths around one million thus far. time around 35 million died reasons. huge overlap died Covid would otherwise died fairly short time reasons. thought process get told I‚Äôm soooooooo negative. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that. nothing compare to.‚Äù  It‚Äôs starting make hate people again. also started screening passengers form Wuhan early December, two three months countries even started taking seriously. excellent beer Quebec! think one kind light apricot flavored? while. French ""End world"" people uni lingual packaging grandmother called like ""bechara modi, hes soo much tea seller"" lmao.... like resign like soo much india.. built 500 years old temple.. I'm like anyone make lol... 


Indian people india brainwashed modi go work. 

I'll hedge bets take shit die.

Welcome capitalism. Excess deaths far relevant nominal death number. 

If don‚Äôt understand concept applies covid worth research. leading candidates except inactivated virus vaccines uncharted territory. likely fail. beyond single inactivated virus vaccine west. riding hype train unproven technologies massive downsides (Pfizer needs -70¬∞C storage, forget it). Nobody even mentions nasal vaccination, forefront respiratory virus.

Well, sooner later people realize simple, whole vaccine development/trials/administration story go multiple years. Okay going stay home make sure 6-11 year old kid going work???? really think 6 year old gonna sit zoom day online work himself?? Hell even 13 year old would hard get that. Great place, shoot lot porn public there. Great place. Passive aggression peaceful. üòÇ ask Canadian meet get Highway 401 house chances tell you. 

The ""follow road"" bit South Park bit true. swear godüòÇüòÇüòÇ remember average body type Nebraska ‚Äúbutter‚Äù Sorry way, like Justin. think he's nice guy. He's two-faced, find nice guy.

I hate much hear voice saying this. Lol 10 times 4 months stepped outside 10 times today alone. Even went buddies firepit beers. Youre gonna white hair 40 spreading it. intentionally gas lighting President. ppl spreading deadly virus?
doubtful. ""My second amendment mental health help need""

-Some Republican, Probably Need adjust average age population well. Many countries median age much still kindergarten. Almost million people died since March globally even flu season. 

This funny. People died. Putting tesla stocks. Need cybertruck soon. Graves? They‚Äôd never give us dignity burial LBR Like what? Nope. really comment people say stupid stuff. prada

opinion instantly discarded. Yeah Singapore getting gradually safe. May one year everything fine, incompetent not, keep troubles time anti-maskers covid deniers. first 8k cases COVID high death rate. SARS never spread much COVID good comparison.  NUKE ANTARCTICA Per capita wise raw numbers Americans far biggest population. 100% citizens Vatican City used reddit notice. Argentina 11k yesterday. kinda fucked lol news gonna say number turns negative lol rich work home. get confused.

Germans certainly much smarter Americans. America successful economically that's **despite** people. (That's market size, strong believe free market, low social security.) China enough work supplying vaccine ASEAN countries, Africa Latin America first anyway. want get back line. Fires care borders either. Also important one month passed since recruited large number people. proven safe much longer period. sounds really good. sounds like need better sick leave benefits well Yep, community they're thinking asking us come back work next week. 2 weeks school started. work lot elders people communities.

Shit scary. gives shit ""excess deaths?"" number means nothing. Oh no. I've 2-3 meters together, washing mask wearing hands frequently.

Thanks tip, hard us grasp.

Fundamental reminders! Like Mainers thinking great idea indoor wedding followed indoor reception permitted # people plus masks get 150 cases one end state getting infected including york county jail (offers &amp; spouses plus inmates) nursing home/rehab center secondary third hand cases ones die, ones chose go church recpetion without masks required law.

because hit hard people acted like magically immune. Oh reminds anthoer outbreak connected wedding minister's church least 10 infections far &amp; probably come since minister anti-mask. Also church school waiting outbreak well unless parents buck religious authority pull kids outbreak. god, wish family best. that‚Äôs awful. Oh that‚Äôs nice superstores Ottawa rewire masks since August don‚Äôt offer disposable ones. SHAKE BAKE! ironic part anti-China bots actually benefit vaccines tested Chinese civilians. refuse accept vaccine released China. Lol...theyre far top.

Evaluating performance difference countries pandemic worst one metric. Glad see bit good news. Hopefully see news like future places. part problem. judgement. Observation fact. Shameless whataboutism right Yes ‚Äúclass‚Äù Swedish means group people ‚Äúsubject‚Äù ages 7-12 subjects group people using teacher. 

What I‚Äôm wondering system works us kids age (6 up, high school), ie whether find 8 year old saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs maths teacher‚Äù ‚Äúshe‚Äôs English class‚Äù - things can‚Äôt happen Sweden elsewhere. 

A 14 year old can, that‚Äôs pretty natural.  People hate idea China. US headline would read different.  CANADA, FUCK YEAH. Real land free! hoping move one day, wait... many. universities pre-print servers. several discipline-wide servers MedRXiv Search interested Google Scholar set news feed like general Google. 

Preprints completed peer review (some never do). great science. Anyone solid STEM background sort wheat chafe. published papers make grade (ha!) pretty clear. Definitely better resources mainstream media. room happens Seconded. 

All people fighting persistence lung damage, COVID arteries heart worried about. 

I've pneumonia before. fucked 6 months afterward, fine. I've also chemo ended high blood pressure result, side effect stuck around couple years thus far, spite every health metric going back normal within 6 months ceasing chemo. üòû Looks like one them, look subredits follow, clearly keeping eye ever commenting PRC crimes. Fitness guru gone expert infectious disease NEED LISTEN PEOPLE MUZZLE VOICES. isnt lockdowns. stupid shit like allowing kids play parks force students attend exams. that‚Äôs im afraid going happen - mask sharing. number isn‚Äôt going stay zero worldwide vaccine. It‚Äôs almost year it‚Äôs apparent it‚Äôs impossible make everyone follow rules. Welcome rest pandemic. People aren‚Äôt going change better haven‚Äôt already. Lol...see so.many votes fron slaves Xijinpin.. Yes kids mix hallways similar. obviously nonzero spread schools long spread society. Luckily seems pretty poor spreaders. think key part debate around schools one must *accept* spread schools like it‚Äôs acceptable anywhere else open (offices, restaurants, ..). Schools *last* close, close everything else to, keep schools open without exceeding ‚Äúbudget‚Äù spread society whole. Fuck. Parents work. need pay food, rent, etc. 

THe govt. paying parents stay home kids - since that's going happen get shame parents keeping roof kids' heads. think countries endless money support never ending lockdowns. dont. don‚Äôt deserve education

Though actually thing need...together compassion. What?? last week someone died Vancouver. Lockdowns push costs onto individuals allow leaders take responsibility actions. cruise ships course. hospitals serve rich schools serve libtards. /s Must fucking nice..... opinion piece, column. There's absolutely nothing wrong posting opinion piece.

Links BBC, mouthpiece British government, posted time. problem that?

Why address argument presented piece instead? Sounds like I'm gonna bring shit load it. OP going need bigger purse. way deaths year previous years. worse.

Stop. Lying. hard prove, likely going move on. However, couple unexplained transverse myelitis similar severe neurological complications vaccine group, vaccine history. kind middle strategies. locked early, sweden didnt. deaths frontloaded. opened part, facing nearing end wave result that.

canada locked much longer california, seems rising canada look trends. dont lockdown (which might not), deaths come future them. hear usually overtime work ‚Äúdirecting traffic‚Äù. Usually standing maybe something 4 times hour normal person could do. whack. nice news, unfortunately case numbers still rise. get complacent!

Wear mask public, bathe often, wash hands frequently, live healthy life, maintain social distancing much possible. 250k people died year year over. huge fucking red flag something wrong? Numbers lie especially excess death numbers. wish  That‚Äôs coincidence, guess really popular lol Smarter question US one egoistic cultures surprise. scientifically measurable fact. fact indictment Brazil. want trials places lot illness, get better stats protective vaccine is. 100 getting sick control versus 10 vaccine group informative statistically significant 10 vs 1. ‚ÄúMust nice‚Äù
 - America weird look country whole state different timeline 190k dead. see article actually says mid late 2021, one full year vaccine. think that's decent estimate, again, given countries less cases seemingly everyone instantly goes back normal lockdowns lift think Americans going still wearing masks months there's vaccine. laws masks distancing, see. strange thumbnail. WTC?? Safe Zeppelins risk also others agency matter. people need around people dependent and/or vulnerable. get infected COVID, exposing risk entire community. get keep uncle? level. Uk close US fat germany average europe only. 30% instead getting close 50% tired winning yet? football Texas. thing matters God himself. cousin's writing neet tomorrow , super scared everyone else :/  know. making joke exacerbate sounds like masturbate. Ignorance bliss... Recirculating ***was problem*** cruise ships. altitude fly can't expel contaminated air. cruise ship designed safety could. Congrats Canada! well deserve light end tunnel. used think would cool opportunity move states Canada. don‚Äôt care politics issues really end. Main reason would bad idea US Heath care system insurance tied job. sick, still need eat get medication. need take public transportation go pharmacy grocery store.

But yeah, wearing mask uncivilized \s Use get around paywall? What? afford Vice President part PSA commercial time? Older actually, 50-70's friends usually best parties. human actually older people get information cable news. turned entertainment based last couple decades. also mostly America. Living countries watch news also lot America rest world. America everything America. isn't. fact analysis based another stat. 

Cases rising means future rising death need Covid die it. also usually takes many days die Covid. changed name Czechia. sayin! report serosurvey indicated india hit 6.4M cases may itself. testing rates hit rock bottom one state hit literally 25%+ positivity rate post labelled ""Good News"". way around bad news labelled ""Bad News""? Herd immunity doesnt work though cop went back station, lower cops numbers protests. US never really locked seems getting it.

Correct, governors every state. number states lockdowns, media incorrectly calls shelter-in-place. 

The us still far many deaths cases compared Europe, 4x numbers US adjusted population. Covid barely foot note history talking deaths, percentage global population even register blip Experts (scientists) confident virus began Wuhan. plus 1.3 billion rights choose People sense proportion. equate fire pit beers 300 person weddings. Lol muslim plan exactly, lol

It also still circulates globally today. Spring Festival (around early February) China basically Christmas Thanksgiving combined level importance, China went ""holiday cancelled!"" ordered national lockdown regardless. 

That's huge deal, never happened modern Chinese history, made immediately realize bad virus is, huge break unavoidable US world. video posted college house packed people, cops show up. police officer asked see id ran name got pinged positive covid19. tell cop entire house positive (10 people live there, 20 party.) breaking quarantine rules state. think got issued $500 fine probably reported head office college. thing is, none kids cared ever. acting like nothing wrong seemed perplexed big deal. freaking terrifying.

My province ‚Äúre opened‚Äù since June different phases definitely seen daily case rates go compared reopening (back ~100-140 day instead 40-50) ICU numbers stayed quite steady usually 10 people (6 currently) hospitalizations currently 41, fairly consistent well.

Remote learning age kind absurd. True. ProudBoys boys entered chat. Sweden playing long game. Lockdowns panic-driven short-term strategy, like trying keep shareholders happy next quarter. link underlying health concerns. Read comment already addressed increased concern. Yeah America sucks many ways, least call ambulance I'm gonna die British Columbia people..even heart Vancouver wait TWO HOURS Maybe I‚Äôm getting cynical particularly upset personally affected, done compassion. always treat sick, done sympathy people like this. grew people could never get college all, yet many still understand importance gravity pandemic despite extra education. 

People like don‚Äôt need education. enough. don‚Äôt care, already made decision disregard health well others. explaining educating make difference. affects someone love, won‚Äôt care. even does, still might care. I‚Äôve seen even family.

When inflation salary common people dint raise much rest super rich Corporation leeches humanity big deal, country, US A, reporting now. know rest countries, Italy increase cases mostly due asymptomatic people caught wide-range tests (we're testing way first wave). leads higher detection who, first wave, left aside undetected testing people hospitals came clear symptoms. given \~5% risk death - math. hey dude feeling wish studies would publish models getting yours?

Why would ok? conditions increase risk? whos shithole country lol Well think raise them. directly attributed bar how?  Well open border let us in..cause gonna let y'all suffer us? hell would let kids go trick-or-treating year?? rounded Please tell get here. Mitch McConnell could get Stimulus passed Kentuckians stay home.  Persistent damage gradually improves...righhhhhht fall exceptions guess we'll hear class action lawsuit point. know comparison flu bad one

Okay, people compare COVID flu call flu triggering, agree. Nationwide, we've many times deaths COVID (with &lt;10% population it) last 4 flu seasons. Nebraska, case. Nebraska hardly hit COVID yet. way see excess deaths comparing flu season.

If interested, play around CDC page.  first thoughts, ur GD mask right Thats pretty much covered ""given enough time right circumstances""

All mentioned keep damaging body time tend stop. pretty much yes, conditions let body heal itself. doesnt get time circumstances. 

Covid hand thing regarding post infection damage.  Big factor schools reopening. Quebec reopened schools many schools last 2 weeks believe, Ontario opened schools past Tuesday. I'm simple unfrozen caveman lawyer, Covid viable 72 hours outside host, wanted contain it, would provide 2 weeks provisions everyone household, lock country 2 weeks. emergencies, dealt appropriately protected emergency workers. That's it, needed done contain virus. Seems like party August spreading event. cases also among residents, visitors. 

I'm surprised hard time getting Nantucket residents cooperate- live privacy resent hit tourism. However, interesting note New Bedford got added MA's list high risk communities high speed ferry Nantucket leaving there, well. think visitors still playing large role spread. Definitely lot ferry goers coming New Bedford. Good you! keep American disease vectors away. volunteer provisional mountie, always wanted right hat.  lmao Chinese vaccines currently phase 3 require booster, usually done something like 2 weeks first shot. didn‚Äôt know California country He'll get even know vaccines work? numerous cases catching gastroenteritis onboard cruise pre-COVID says otherwise.

I'll stay floating petri dish, thank kindly. ;) Similar situation. going grabbing pick-up outside someone yelled car ""why would wear mask outside, look stupid."" even friends impress. literally Chicago people everywhere, 99% masks. 

All could think ""why would care look mask? person care wear mask?"" odd way think. Lol everyone totally caving virus, saying f** it. Back school means people pretty much accepted second wave coming. know teachers Montreal. One already self isolation another teacher four students tested positive. People pretty much decided time go back normal. 

I'm sure take virus trickle vulnerable, expect things look tenable sudden kids gave kids gave kids gave grandma lead really bad situation again. come back Costco grocery store, I‚Äôd infer many really translates ‚Äúmany people valuable segment‚Äù. Amazon didn‚Äôt buy Whole Foods win grocery, bought win upmarket.

As logistics improve demand drives delivery costs, I‚Äôm sure grow there‚Äôs shortage foot traffic shopping aisles yet. Businesses require mask regardless think logic little off. flu season, could spread flu someone vulnerable dies result. make murderer nobody saying wear masks flu season. scha¬∑den¬∑freu¬∑de

""pleasure derived someone another person's misfortune.""

You know, feel thst little clarification order. 

I work Urgent Care COVID19 testing. send sympathy cards loved ones patients we've sent hospital, died. get report, speak medical examiner it. traumatizing pick phone, hear, ""This Dr. Xyz, medical examiner. patient named ABC?"" sort thing happening often. can't imagine anger feel poor, dear little old lady dies little Johnny *had* see grandma. dead. 

So every time see someone exposing others around deadly virus, make point tell correct blunder. 

If person took picture grieving fiance fireman, would asked adjust mask. certainly would published picture. 

I can't tell families seen afflicted virus, it'd take 7 months typing tell them. (Not mention HIPAA). say way, way, way many them. could avoided it. 

So no, get pleasure sorrow. feel anger. personal experiences fact supported data. Kansas, religious gatherings responsible cluster outbreaks bars restaurants, correctional facilities, daycare, group living, meat packing, schools sports. come behind colleges, long term living facilities, hospitals, private events, private businesses. Spare ""alpha"" bullshit. public health part promoting general welfare written document people claim worship know it. 

As me, work public facing health care job never furloughed laid off. Every day went work risked health help fight thing still that, fight assholes read internet telling simple universal precautions using decades, including wearing mask going cause die ""carbon monoxide"" refuse either mask leave building.  people like stand say, ""Hey, let's part stop this."" 

It may government's job command, government's job LEAD! Unfortunately, instead real leader, reality tv star played businessman...poorly. 

Are really telling keeping little distance people wearing mask blow holes worth 200000 lives? much you? noticed too. really concerned people might react ended buying regular N95s. way anyone else around wearing point, I'm bit hypochondriac. also live dad, 70 sees two older sisters weekly basis, there's that. Dear Canada,

Must nice. Congratulations.

I'm tempted move Canada start new life shit's with. Non-proud US citizen here. talked bosses day Rudy Gobert caught virus coronavirus contingency plan... fucking laughed face Nebraska... dumb. Same, difficult decision rather daughter healthy safe. It‚Äôs tough trying work home taking care toddler, could never forgive got sick. concepts cost/ benefit analysis risk mitigation critical here. benefit school/childcare ability go work pay bills, mortgage, provide livelihood family. cost increased risk exposure others. cost mitigated mask wearing, social distancing, etc, actively practice. kids go daycare = grandma die irrational. 8,000 total confirmed SARS cases. 25,569,000 COVID cases rising. Even use severe COVID cases hundreds thousands millions people risk permanent damage. done country democrats held house, senate presidency STILL pass single-payer.

Oh Citizen's United. covid right now. I'm isolation personally felt little cold beginning feel nothing. results confirmed wondering. know elderly people underlying conditions, necessarily case. people vigilant protecting (if care. able decide risks want take). really sick, obviously go hospital try limit transmission contact, respect others, wear mask. think done, means reflects done, able coerce people anything. end day, disease. Like said, without vaccine, spread people die (until enough healthy people immunity).

As businesses, let business owners want private property (requiring mask not), like that, find another establishment. That's free market works. People support businesses align priorities. good news here...but curious lasting effects heart we‚Äôve hearing literally complained Michelle Obama undercounting number deaths occurred watch.

[Seriously. Since quarantine people test positive law pretty much everywhere guess would make sense know they're breaking law not. listen science they're told. dare accuse greatest china supreme leader xi Jinping ever coronavirus nothing semantics. issue misinformedly (and yet assertively) contradicting commenter factual point. That's misinformation spreads.

And indeed suspicious change trend data (a sudden suppression certain states aligned one pary) exactly coincided timing data-processing hand-off. Even conclusively prove data somehow fraudulent, still qualifies degree ""credible evidence"" warrant questioning taking closer look. worked India best handling COVID-19? tell favorite wine favorite chocolate tried even warn could die.  realize become immune right. infected twice. Lol wtf becuase kids low risk ok risk lives get education? Classic. 


Lets mention staff ect ect ect. PEOPLE .... ""president lung damage sir, inhaler. tacos"". American, allowed Canada felony marijuana charge, totally getting fake id moving Canada somehow ‚Äúwins‚Äù election. first half also depends precautions they're taking. read somewhere lot 9/11 first responders suffered lot health problems 9/11. Major toxins released NYC WTC collapsed. Lots reports lung/breathing problems first responders. really sad...I could see would underlying health condition would make high risk covid. I'm suggesting they're total failure, they've done ""ok"" whole time. they're shining example beating virus, point restrictions go away. Especially exact moment cases spiking midwest.  kids.  could/ may new normals life 

Being taught young age understand importance staying clean survive.  Seems like brainer.....  learn much young.  brains like sponge.  take in.  new ways fun.  

I'm even sure game invented yet.  time become adapted create new games.

However Federal government sent relatively message, national response compromised messages sent province. parasitic shit ‚ÄúAttack killer grandchildren‚Äù How.... fact India cannot afford another lockdown. vast majority retail India done independent guys run small shops. lot people see living slums men work factories women work maids. majority farmers India small farms running razor thin margins. second lockdown going make life worse people. mention India cash based economy, even demonetization happened years ago. Ordinary people go banks withdraw cash pay things. Even large majority parliament, federal government India much. mean people get infected coronavirus spread too?

But yeah, really reassuring 18-22 year olds spreading probably die. really still taking guy seriously? He‚Äôs wrong liar every step way. explain, Texas teachers literally fired, lose teaching license, pension benefits striking. 
 
We literally hold teachers ""higher"" standards police. Goes show governor Abbott politicians place priorities. *The Florida man entered ring*  meant covid.

I'm basically asking we're blowing rare exceptions not. tragic may be. Except Covid *IS* SARS virus; SARS-CoV-2 exact we're 6 months US. No, yet, sorry.  
This based mouse studies, say infectious disease medicine- ""Mice lie, monkeys always exaggerate, ferrets weasels"". 
Don't worry, something eventually work, could even this! works people, work. logic, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune diseases, aids, must real problems then. Everything except brain cells heals own. That‚Äôs great, bad people dying things never considered letting body heal itself.

Lol... life world economy 88 year olds live another couple months ridiculous

And that's stuck pretend that's need. alone keeping world economy alive. That's scary part Given comments far, seems pretty clear sub can. Jeeze, horrible. Youre getting voted SARS much severe COVID get. Danielle long history copying designers. admittedly didn‚Äôt read particular article, she‚Äôs partying Hamptons summer... large house parties, posting rapid testing, traveling. headline perhaps focused that. worked well USA...

India sinking. Today, 12 Sep, 2020, 97,570! Damn. anybody understand 50/50 odds, could still die? damn virus mutated easily spread. could mutate something worse. fact mutate may render vaccine less effective. gonna get jabbed go galavanting. recipe extinction human life planet. enjoy life got it. Seriously. Yes. It‚Äôs epidemiologic problem, social one. makes sense one type expert decision-making table. Good. Shit work anyways. Poison water causes renal issues. 

Leronlimab Bradykinin inhibitors need. Disgustingly racist, you? lol? still move (most) provinces Canada. 

We getting tired/exhausted measures too, hence recent uptick cases. subtle differences response trust public health measures Canada US. easy way see it, reading national media countries. Numerous states version this, couple individual states' shipments seized. Nevermind individual states fending themselves.

I think MD governor's wife made direct Korea deal got special permission land BWI, shipment secreted away guarded staties. alone presidency-ending scandal, go lengths protect health workers federal theft. days backpage news tuesday.  EDIT: tests, PPE. Amateurs. 

We nearly 98000 cases India yesterday 1200 deaths

And govt busy enforcing exams students lakhs students attend. Er...no? Nothing changes Biden wins. Anti-maskers going change mind point. States plenty time get shit together put together plan even trying anymore.

The BLM protests helping either. People act like spreading COVID they're ""all wearing masks"" wearing masks masks need worn ALONG social distancing. Homemade masks 100% effective even social distancing. hypothetical scenario 1: one gets vaccine find still distance wear masks. Pandemic, distance, masks last another 3 years.

scenario 2: everyone gets vaccine stop distancing wearing masks. pandemic lasts another year (restaurants, theaters closed)

scenario 3: everyone gets vaccine still distancing masks. pandemic months (everything reopens) even word.

It seems like perfectly cromulent word me. (&lt;‚Äî That's conceding correct wrong...?

Well, claimed incorrect ""semantics"", seemingly downplaying irrelevant suggesting matter fact. Besides, false assertion earlier (and prominent) comment still un-edited un-corrected, continuing spread one source. single accusation. One thread evidence. I‚Äôm asking.

There video posted reddit Jul 27, seen data anomaly detailed. woudl already linked prior comment, post removed mods (due ""political"" violation sub rules) YouTube video since set private: try track info it. find follow-up video person, explains removed video. summarizes motivation removal 3 reasons:

 1] anomaly weaker, though still present, removed analysis two states (Texas Florida) fact new public health mandates implemented relevant timeframe could rationally contributed declined rate new COVID cases seen, ...

 2] ""unclear [him] whether mechanism whereby HHS system influence total case counts"", ...

3] ""The real reason, though..."" (he emphasizes) ""didn't like direction lot conversation going"", COVID-deniers/anti-maskers latching onto video misusing it. (""Some interpreted results calling question importance public health infrastructure efficacy masks, social distancing, non-pharmacological interventions."")

-----

That said, fact data issue/observation seem raised scientists state-level authorities give hope benign/legit explanation. really sheer hope faith people better access data sources (especially via channels separate HHS's data collection, comparison), would already detected raised alarm grave data issue, real and/or still uncorrected. Yawn. Tired fallback. It‚Äôs clear said quote. think uptick emigration trump wins Biden wins?  BC. There‚Äôs shortage everywhere, doesn‚Äôt mean handing nursing licenses everyone.

Sorry reading comprehension. :( can't believe downvoted. kind selfish attitude (why still wear mask getting vaccine) that's going prolong pandemic even longer.

Sorry you‚Äôre stuck bad spot, hope gets better area Alberta they'll test want one, went pharmacy, got prescription filled asymptotic test hell truly believe large number deaths (and covid) happened hospitals overloaded/unprepared.  Nurses easy. moved Canada last year engineer, fianc√©e stuck US least two years get job nurse Canada. sucks Maybe Fauci lied masks early on. surely fueled anti-mask fire gave people excuses work. Orange Menace steals another election November, there'll lot people applying once. Beat crowd act now. :)



That‚Äôs pet talking about. didn‚Äôt assume anything. Canada liberal PM right now, that's attractive republicans. Dude mean nationality, religion baseless debate me. language called Hindi, Hindu person follows Hinduism. laugh languages, mind you. Wow took 3 comments become US Two weeks. Two years. Two decades. Cancelling living save lives. Nothing makes sense anymore. recently saw news like 40k anti mask protest Germany... viewed Germans? current situation, kind do. millions two week old chickens dealt shutdown - real option continue processing them. 

Our state cut meat production back 60%. Along program mandatory testing instigated processing facilities. cases found way, many employees would otherwise avoided tested. Eh, nah it‚Äôs like second wave really ill defined term actual meaning 50% Canadians live Windsor-Quebec City corridor. Thanks, mate. :) Funny assume assume. ;)

I came close Las Vegas massacre 3 years ago... lazy night, went off-Strip casino right next AirBnB. mile away shooting.

If I'd spent evening walking around Strip, there's chance would've killed wounded like hundreds others.

You probably care things, nonetheless - feels **amazing** worry mass shooting about. Can't put price tag peace mind...  Brazil speaks primarily Portuguese. simply can't believe you, also countries, election system twisted 400 million people, two senile lunatics best get choose from. 

And bombs take wherever want can. Wonderful. *The hockey player exits arena* feels needs working class families single parents pretty much ignored situation. want rant, sic bot again. buying one way ticket Canada November 4th case. ‚ÄúGet back work, suckers!‚Äù mean Hindi one several languages speak. There‚Äôs indian like French speak French.
Edit lol changed hindu Hindi I‚Äôm indian especially dumb RIP. God bless all. Lmao Vietnam then? Welcome dictatorship
Laughs Serbian Oklahoma here. We're hiding numbers. *laughs Indian* Ight bad! it‚Äôs California. Stop hyperventilating posting fake facts. overall case count still extremely reasonable especially comparing jurisdictions. Also funds allocated school boards, it‚Äôs start spending accordingly.  Lastly schools opened many regions Ontario already illustrates clueless biased are. Relax breathe, everything fine. I‚Äôll even say...since figure I‚Äôm last list get vaccine...but vaccination process natural leveling virus brings deaths spread bad flu season levels...I‚Äôm abandon masks/distancing that! So. Many. Of. friends. gathering groups. can‚Äôt fucking take it. Like LARGE groups, see posting lots small group visits within 2 weeks. This. New Brunswick test ONE symptom. Guess cough runny nose today! Me. Guess thought might die impaled* Q tip? too! husband. People think enough people tested wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs case. Actually, proves things working since exponential growth cases control situation.  don‚Äôt believe way POTUS acts affects US citizens? 

The personal attributes POTUS affect US citizens. care US president beats wife, takes drugs, etc.. care enacts laws policies affect me. worlds stage doesn‚Äôt matter? countries view US affects nothing? 

It doesn't. rest world knows US wants, engineer coup, support revolution, straight invade them. nobody dare oppose us. Also, you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúpersonal flaws‚Äù like aren‚Äôt big deal, don‚Äôt affect policy? stupid? Selfish?

Of course personal flaws matter. example, Thomas Jefferson rapist. raped underaged Sally Jennings years. Jefferson's contributions America? lot growing do, though given defen Don, can‚Äôt expect much personal growth anyways.

Where defend anybody? pointing personal failings US president immaterial, long result policy legal changes. evidence one wave. 

California pretty good response we‚Äôve shut seems like ages. Yet still spreading high rate. Exactly. study may flawed conclusion genomic testing done verify path infection child child even child adult. Multiple studies show children spreaders unless severely weakened immune systems.

The study uses contact tracing. staff could gotten kids infected parents could infected kids home. Ahh optimist  here. I'm done get vaccine. Even without ""perfect"" vaccine get least like season flu that's gonna enough everyone I'm trying wear mask forever delusional hope eradicating virus. Also, like there's reason to. someone 10 day incubation period exposed lockdown still infectious everything opens up, we‚Äôre back square 1...

Even Wuhan strictest lockdown ever stay way 2 months.  work way Illinois I'd turn residential years otherwise I'd get hit massive additional sales tax. bad investment, taken coms property spent 35 years paying can't even sold profit - despite housing prices going around here. Thanks fat fuck gang basically lose 30% net worth sell everything move everyone coming visit BC. Staggering number Quebec, Ontario, Alberta (and rest provinces far outnumber rest) plates BC right now. Like... disgusting numbers visitors. Yeah Canadian want us hunker home communities, travel BC cause trip Hawaii/Mexico/Florida got cancelled. Florida here....sigh Also, HIV airborne. know people justify case spikes ""because there's testing, cases obviously go up!""

[This side Funny assume republicans wouldn‚Äôt leave Biden wins. maybe it‚Äôs bluster both? thought cops harassed black people reason? First big hot spots schools opened yet. example Toronto opens next week. Secondly open last week would take longer show bump cases. jump cases everything people caring, greedy employers, wedding season (thanks Brampton), churches bars open reason. school bump hit.... Yet. 

We back stage 2 soon rate. Amazing &lt;3 
Americans like give hope.

Keep lord's work. CARE jumpsuit can't worn Mexican kids, good even Melania wear once. Fuck Trump Hillary. Neither representatives working class. see implication anywhere? point remain vigilant numbers creeping back up.  order close, school needs 10% population sick, county needs 20% tpr! insane. problem new infections would go past two weeks, plus health care workers, infected family members get sick 2-14 days exposure.

The lockdown would need six weeks end least. Coronavirus back menu boys. Actually one made interview injection, saw article Taiwan remember wrote it. everything else anyone sort epidemiology background mentions. 


Comments Reddit awful this. ample evidence immunity disease lasts months? There's been, what, like 4 confirmed cases reinfection entire planet? of, now, 28 million people (officially) caught died across past 10 months? Exactly. It‚Äôs nice see string sensible posts thread. reading someone preventing wear proper mask, people protesting think freedom impaired need wear mask middle pandemic.

What misconception freedom rights.
Planning watch Idiocracy weekend see Oracle says going. evidence numbers (and I'm suggesting manipulation) excess deaths. could easily lot different reasons (unemployment, etc) likely directly indirectly related COVID.

But I'd say due imperfect testing circumstances almost landlords. rest world run like big cities subject laws taxes mainly aimed them. 

Not everyone scumbaggy landlord like Critters 3. Federal leadership large numbers selfish, science denying wackos welcome canada, bud Seriously. seen one person panic. people seem ""going overboard"" safety social distancing.  # Forbes Article BACKGROUND**  schools daycare centers racing reopen nationwide, public health officials warned kids become infected school bring virus home them.

You probably go read classist statements assume think. conservatives *and* liberals abstained voting instead leftists all, world would much better place. YES! Totally agree. It‚Äôs cruel expect people hunker whenever. Four months? must brutal friends family. May Rest Peace. Another thing Canada better US would die within days? weddings actually pretty common source infections here. one said rich problem, government helping us out. didn‚Äôt. 

But making classist statements doesn‚Äôt mean think it‚Äôs rich that‚Äôs issue. 
Part people like assuming everyone enough money keep kids home. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs classist.  link freely available data?  Like lot things USA there‚Äôs mishmash laws state, county, city level answer won‚Äôt consistent state state. Plus there‚Äôs overarching federal law protects healthcare information called HIPAA, sharing health information without patient consent result incredibly massive fines. However, there‚Äôs host exceptions law enforcement purposes medical information needed law enforcement. However, what‚Äôs even bigger barrier don‚Äôt national health system, there‚Äôs ungodly mess electronic health record systems used thousands upon thousands unaffiliated health providers doctors, labs, hospitals, etc., combos providers EHRs may may talk directly indirectly health information exchanges. work massive health care organization using one connected popular EHRs even can‚Äôt get complete health record patient. odds law enforcement pull health record common stop ID search extremely low.

The police easily get medical information without consent various HIPAA exceptions, generally involves going calling places patient seen. example police might interested patient‚Äôs mental health condition want record, would first figure patient‚Äôs psychiatrist psychologist is.

It sounds like state enforceable law place requiring people test positive quarantine, decided COVID-19 test results need available law enforcement sake public health quarantine enforcement. Notice cop said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen before. There‚Äôs input compute tested positive.‚Äù Seeing medical info ID search sounded norm him.

In state state level mask law quarantine law. mask laws mishmash laws may may present county city level. state level quarantine law. live county population millions, department public health says quarantine positive. However it‚Äôs mandatory enforceable. Police area probably don‚Äôt access COVID results.

So like lot things USA answer is...maybe? love healthy debate, I‚Äôve always thought strange people intentionally try make people‚Äôs arguments sound silly order obliterate sounding silly. time, know exactly person means.

There‚Äôs way much straw-manning going never seen anyone change mind reverse course due one. usually makes person making straw man argument feel superior moment.

The Governor Nebraska believes curve flattened enough overwhelm hospitals, primary goal. hospitals lot capacity available equipment state officials believe reopen without overwhelming medical system. might right might wrong. certainly could wrong much COVID spreading. There‚Äôs plenty ways argue point without trying make people appear foolish self-aggrandizement. Meanwhile fundwick (NB) has...3? Active cases total. Oh Canada! federal employee while, 90% feds got telework home six months, military worked worked 2 days week 7. schedule still like now, crazy. people worked said covid best thing happen them. You‚Äôd look West North - always hard recruit teachers north 60th parallel! perform genomic tests parents determine child gave virus? study seen Iceland genomic study came conclusion young children (under 11) almost never spread parents other. sure data (contact tracing) parents/staff give disease children separately daycare interactions? added 66K cases past three weeks bars closed indoor dining, allowed all, capped 50%. Schools closed. DeSantis's take it? Well, hospitalizations increase, let's keep opening stuff up! heck long-term complications, kids MIS-C complications, vulnerable still stuck home 8 months feeling forgotten....just open Dr. Atlas president say need do. now? Opening bars, he's going lift caps indoor dining said, opening schools, allowing visitation long-term care facilities, opening bars again, allowing visits prisons....all around time. Makes sense. know trigger cases go again?  guess matter since he's already said we're locking again, matter happens. 2022 cannot come fast enough me. need Governor leader understands science...or least willing listen experts do. number one reason: population **density**

FIFY. FWIW numbers wikipedia *severely* date. interesting reported death rate still going down? virtue signalers got taste power March/April &amp; want drag everyone them. Cal live, world basically back running (w/ precautions course) hospitals empty. Waving white flag Caseademic equal death age group. like US? Probably cases go they‚Äôre testing more? Good luck!

-Someone Washington State really believe jump based fact everything starting gradually open back up. I‚Äôm sorry! Hoping quick recovery! Omg, really needed something teritory stop talking 9/11. know many people abroad died influence intervention? 

Yes, every teroris act horrific condemned, example, officially bombed country, so, yeah. don‚Äôt believe way POTUS acts affects US citizens? worlds stage doesn‚Äôt matter? countries view US affects nothing? Also, you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúpersonal flaws‚Äù like aren‚Äôt big deal, don‚Äôt affect policy? stupid? Selfish? likely healthy mixture both? said lot stupid, vapid bullshit. lot growing do, though given defen Don, can‚Äôt expect much personal growth anyways.

Seriously, Washington good Stop spreading misinformation. Nebraska's highest 7-day average new deaths 7. reached single day. second highest 6. also occured single time. California average 110 deaths per day month. Nebraska 1/20th population California. 110/20 = 5.5 higher per capita entire month California 2 days Nebraska entire 6 months. Also California 361 deaths per million, Nebraska 224, less half rate 596 United States average. Furthermore comparison populous state rural state doesnt make much sense, California also 3rd largest state terms area. apt metric would percentage population living rural parts state. basic research posting next time.  OnlyFans yet? Except movies, guy always right.

Fauci told people worry. told people change behaviors. told people wear masks. 

Early April starts changing tune, things would much better provided better information public earlier.

I realize part covid task force that, mean, took kids swimming lessons extended family mocking me, one actually sent Fauci interview says change anything.

I also get nobody seems upset guy, everyone seems think Trump awful downplaying virus.

Trump awful, hate him. still. hardly alone. Chinese data, lol Actually prime moviegoing population 18 35.

Edit: ah. said theatre. True! US colleges basically let anyone cash. got donate times. Well, Miami better infection rate..... packing people together. Nothing like side brain damage go coronavirus guess. heard boyfriend one friends works one member band. wife pregnant sitting Serbia, playing music idiots Petri dish able care new family.

Thanks typing out. complex nuanced issue, easy fixes.

 We've seen spread looks like mitigation. can't afford pay everyone stay home there's widely distributed vaccine without major societal reform, extremely unlikely. many people want anyway. understandable. We're social animals, young healthy, might balk restricted long basically benefit others. Yes, that's selfish, reality situation.

 Personally, think best way proceed safe vaccine maintain enough measures there's hospital capacity need it, maximize ability people self isolate want to. WFH allowed, online school allowed, strict measures essential businesses like grocery stores post office. empathize sets people, deem risk acceptable, want avoid catching novel virus, whatever reason think know third. funny call weakness strength. Theyre crybabies cant even wear damn mask 20 minutes inside supermarket yet feel super badass wearing one?!

Mental gymnastics Yay, tourism! pretty sure full shit. friend dating told movie. mentioned it, like ""omg, brought me, let's watch it!"" found later brought DVD everywhere (before internet streaming, I'm old) tally showed many people could, gotten 100 proud it.

She one bizarre people ever met life.

Sucks shit happening countries, though. Half time feels like American thing everyone else shit control. Henry's approach voluntarism rather mandates. 50 person limit pretty much earlier recommendations that, recommendations. Thats nothing. state reached million cases yesterday country approaching 100k cases day Yeah Trump didn‚Äôt ask people take seriously. thing taiwan testing everyone like crazy. CDC Trump screwed that‚Äôs immensely. trump tells people it‚Äôs serious half country won‚Äôt. voila Every year ""flu"" caused influenza, known influenza like illness (ILI). viruses cause illnesses get much attention likely cause someone hospitalized (but hospitalize people that's usually samples program come from). extremely capable putting severe end ""mild"" illness, ""mild"" illness simply means require hospital care.

This surveillance data pick unidentified novel pathogens compared US data ""ILI"" provided weekly CDC influenza data releases. ILI usually correlate spikes influenza viruses cause illness resembles influenza. SARS-CoV-2 causes illness influenza like surface, cause spike ILI.

Many us watching spike ""ILI"" could explained rises Influenza viruses tracked. occurred end February early March timeframe. I'm fairly confident virus first confirmed case, seeing widespread transmission point here, scroll ILINet.

In line chart 2019/2020 season shown red, clear ILI past season unusual. There's 3 peaks, there's usually 1. That's outside COVID-19 couple unusual occurrences - new variation influenza B/Victoria virus exceptionally severe RSV season. first peak explained combination Influenza B RSV. second peak explained Influenza H1N1 Influenza B/Victoria. third peak, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). explained viral surveillance data.

This chart clearly delineates virus started spreading like wildfire US- Week 9. means starting February 24, possible even likely someone influenza like illness would caused SARS-CoV-2.

Not quite explaining like 5, broke you. Shortcut understanding looking chart link I've provided. Third bump red line COVID-19. Cops tend worse anyone. refuse wear masks. cop absolutely forced quarantine this, won't. go around exposing others.  Accepting??? Fair enough. wanted use NZ example place thought eradicated virus. hadn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs saying NZ something bad. Quite opposite. 

I don‚Äôt think eradication possible, unless special conditions. even preferred need live longer period time (like couple years). honestly think super strict lockdown problem helpful. Ppl still work many places, allowed get outside anywhere. means sitting inside time, VitD production almost nothing infection risk via AC work higher Germany. brought home everyone stay inside, way get low initial loads virus, always full blown first load. 

We know vitamin crucial infection rate outdoors many many times lower probably even associated lower initial load.

In Germany, many went outside. Fresh air, sun, vitamin D, less infection rate.

That, overall ""social distance"" society seem important factors virus never gone totally likelihood. introduction vaccine mean (the pandemic stage) right away. take vaccinate everyone, large percent population still vaccinated. 

Masks good period everyone getting vaccinated hopefully seeing infections drop off. 

What's bad masks anyways? barely notice mine. way people talk getting rid think stapled faces. Christ almighty. wear forever, maybe lets see majority population vaccinated vaccines actually effective enough curb pandemic making huge pile masks setting fire. Kinda fake tho Funny used anxiety attacks kid stopped got older I'm feeling like making comeback. 

It feels like soft lockdown early work stop spread get wasted infection wave hits month. Hopefully, teachers, school staff, long-term care homes hospitals ready. going lot dead teachers :( Yet province highest numbers day first started. American nurses dont get amount schooling Canadian nurses lot cases. whole point businesses poor parents work peanuts getting richer saying everyone ""economy would colapse"". need keep kids somewhere parents could go breaking back never anything. Trump fan, close border China Europe early (while called xenophobic). Meanwhile Fauci recommending masks general public. sincerely think whole ""corona fatigue"" thing mainly excuse people never made significant effort alter routines first place. certainly mainly hear whining among people know.

I agree basic idea: yeah, people go little squirrelly can't go outside, get exercise, social contact. things responsibly covidtimes little common sense. Canada it‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúqook‚Äù Thank everything colleagues doing. Covid something happens People. never happen You. else going go? maritimes closed. US out. leaves BC. shocked saw flights hotels booked up. Pretty sweet click bait title! US get fucked
- Canadian psychiatrist would care. hope economy port town agrees second wave yet  Canada going upward case trend, Atlantic Canada (NS, NB, NFLD, PEI) extremely well! home province Nova Scotia 2 active cases, NB 2, PEI 8 NFLD 1!

For area, made ""Atlantic bubble"" anyone travelled outside back bubble must self quarantine 14 days. already fined people NS kid today expelled Uni quarantining. fine $1000.

I really think key mandatory self quarantining setting fine. modern technology entail feels amazing worry mass shooting about. 

I don't, never have. think average American worries go places. Yet see comments America get upvoted given badges whatever they‚Äôre called. ""When America sends people, they‚Äôre sending best. They‚Äôre sending you. They‚Äôre sending you. They‚Äôre sending people lots problems, they‚Äôre bringing problems us. They‚Äôre bringing corona. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre racists. some, assume, good people.‚Äù Grounded one year, that's crazy. Yes. Closed borders early implemented masks right away. don‚Äôt understand trying say. Taiwan lockdown well health economy? like troll comments add nothing value discussion California higher population Canada 23x smaller.


CA 3x population sweden size. 

Population density matters.

edit: amusing comparisons looking up: CA's GDP 2x canada, CA's GDP 6x sweden. wish mental health aspect acknowledged more, it‚Äôs either ignored (as someone living America) I‚Äôm told stop sheep it‚Äôs fault adhering lock rules. 10 time 0 still 0 get shit together Around world Covid deaths undercounted. Excess death numbers seem accurate, even still fuzzy hard interpret. undoubtedly better leadership time being. question that. Come think it, can't even really described leadership. realize basically young people care virus right? we're right to, we're going far ahead rest over. Financially, physically, mentally. Must nice oldest son started elementary school week first time 6 months. happy, think teachers/administration great job school (Canada) weather great, school outside day, lots precautions Covid. son around another kid age 6 months, huge deal back class friends, attitude home school amazing too. Well, props her. Mhhmm Well, say small community 100k, sitting 1 case almost 2 weeks. Wow that‚Äôs shocking went double check this, it‚Äôs true. Though per million people US still winning. Yesterday India 3368 new cases 56 deaths per million, US 20K new cases 596 deaths per million. Totals 97k India 46k US, India‚Äôs population 1.4bn US 331m. 5 times many people (sorry, know doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúonly‚Äù) double cases. US topped charts months. excluded data comparisons earlier timing COVID-19 outbreak economic downturn, according study. country's GDP shrank 6.8 percent first quarter bounced back since, growing 3.2 percent second quarter. Don‚Äôt care. landslide best trump imitation ive seen. spirit willing, body spongy bruised Imagine dumb LMAO. Yes let's rescind degrees every single doctor world. Maybe go back living mud huts we're it.  Taiwan also epidemiologist hero SARS epidemic vice president, took measures prevented necessity lock-down locking country's 50 people, three Costcos. Three Maine. Taiwan implement lockdown measures, seemingly saved economy.

Meanwhile, Peru strictest lockdown, along biggest GDP drop, also biggest number deaths per million... Ameridans learning covid-19 lie. Let ask something, Hong Kong set free? India BILLION people living USA yet USA two million cases. Hmm... 100% ""justifiable"" hysteria majority reddit's wet dream first, youre last ;) Talking shit != critical. mom forgot teach you? much worse adults last December. Weird things like mucus dripping eyes constantly. basically live hot showers constantly, felt like get bed, etc. lost ton weight, doctors stumped (until later tested positive antibodies). happened pregnant, too, imagine awfulness. We're extremely lucky milder (if call that) it, full blown. We're still recovering lungs, can't run shit used able chase kids day long...now last maybe 30 minutes full playtime wanting pass out. (That's slowly getting better, think) get better suddenly week two, suddenly got full blast again. took forever recover ""normal' (as normal be) that.

Never seen since. Kid 1 smelling something metallic time kid 2 taste, major clues covid since issues. kids young tell anything aside normal symptoms happening. Generally, fucked virus.

You're right peer pressure thing, teens (as said) really vocal stuff like letting anytime soon. kids may class, boy talk google chats this. drama surrounding real.

Thanks much well wishes! really appreciate it, rough go past year everyone. I'm hoping world finally get handle sometime, know likely least another 6+ months. Hopefully everyone else hanging okay. PM self-lockdown meeting head Tour de France head guy tested positive. lockdown whole country? lol I‚Äôm server work 12 weeks due mandated shut down. husband works home, loss income hit us scraping by. restaurant re-opened June really choice go back provide family. dealing least three COVID cases FOH employees I‚Äôm starting get little freaked out. 

But know try tell manager I‚Äôm worried don‚Äôt feel comfortable working, I‚Äôll two options: stay quit. job waiting me.

EDIT: restaurant following social distancing requirements, wear masks gloves, sanitize constantly operating 25%. Scary. humble, thank god US quality POTUS.

Edit: following btw, dont stop please. Really wish bloody conservatives around world would pay attention more. still really don‚Äôt get it. Moved US decade ago marriage. certainly things miss states last four years, much There‚Äôs really guarantee. cold viruses rhinoviruses. Four coronaviruses cause 20% colds. short term immunity. family like SARS confer longer immunity. 

COVID mutating slowly, mutation nothing reinfection possibility COVID. Currently even creating new stable strains. creating clades. since G mutations pretty stable. G/GR/GS dominant clades make infections. 

There likely lasting immunity tcell memory makes reinfection less likely, still possible. Please read book, moron Haha comment gonna write. Good, boomers dying good redistribution wealth anyway. Bring back cruise please. Say sorry, lot. Someone look Joe Rogan ya?

Holy crap, another shot"" Jesus, git oer urself! am. Could even higher think. enough people tested. vaccine, it‚Äôs effective, _reduces_ chances infection. may also lessen severity illness happen get sick. still wear mask socially distanced usual reasons. Same. I‚Äôm need someone vent to. Lately I‚Äôve felt like screaming void like Midsommar. Joe ü•î that's wholesome, filling, sustainable four years. Trump üçä that's tangy, acidic would eat alive four years. would want consume four years? It‚Äôs yet :/ I‚Äôve encountered multiple people seem think you‚Äôre monster don‚Äôt subscribe ‚Äúeveryone going die‚Äù trope. course...but article exploring issue mayor governor differing opinions, well consequences actions governor authorized carry order deal issue. spacing thinking imagine voting Trump, seeing country 200,000 die, country, double India 3 times population, still wanting guy around after. still thinking better Biden big leading us 2008 crash. Like fucking alienated reality would be? blinded hatred. compare American numbers multiply 10. would 7000 10x bigger population. Please explain I‚Äôm wrong instead blindly bandwagon downvoting No, went business 2011. Wow..such hate. Democrats sure job this, huh? think see cases going September school reopenings terrasses/patios starting close up. Hopefully manageable learn lessons help avoid shutdown winter. Yup Really? wild. Oh know it, played high school experience totally school clubs/sports (of flavours - I'm also huge fucking nerd haha) pissed virus trying get body body.

It's either want act like pandemic *or* they're enamored money care gets sick get it, even kids do. Also, high school football south, I'm sure well aware, pretty much religion (especially small towns).

You'd think there'd least enough sense *this* year, we're living society truth science negotiable, are. really hope kids latent illnesses high-risk family members. Funny president passes enforces national mandates things like immigration, people state officials gripe sue. can‚Äôt ways fits agenda. Totally agree. Trying balance. Shit, way behind. Teaching jobs hard find Canada, least Ontario market saturated. make though pretty much coast! we're still first *Don't forget new record setting temperature year pushing simple Clausius-Clapeyron equation new heights hurricane season.* Per capita equivalent California 205 deaths per day. California peaked running average 140 deaths per day. rural state new deaths per capita populous state something alright, something good. Swede here, lived worked US companies long time here‚Äôs take it.

The US thrives perceived notion personal freedom. 

This happens people feel need exercise freedom instead looking greater good.

It‚Äôs individualist society it‚Äôs reflected everything decentralised state (lack of) healthcare welfare system. 

Add idiot president political charade election times two party system tries politicise win votes pandemic.

Pretty much countries‚Äô politicians agreed bury hatchet pandemic focus greater good.

Unfortunately it‚Äôs perfect storm sincerely hope best. Masks big deal, I'll take  We've learned much people need told do. needs enforced strict penalties. fatal flaw prior thinking believing people could puzzle appropriate responses right thing. can't. Well hot spot America northern plains Canada keep close watch border Sorry, yes, right. comparison generally used Florida = Australia (which misremembered Victoria). I'll find whole figures Australia then, shall I? much different. wins immediately. Sort of. 

It‚Äôs Florida like flu vaccine, maybe 50-75% effective.

Also length immunity unknown. Another bachelor saved covid, wait ment? amending ""a calculated risk, without Covid"", ""...but much higher Covid"", risk Covid higher less obvious.

You argue higher lower arbitrary level risk comfort, point goes *basically zero* *actually risk* Covid. look actual fucking graph real data worldometer. decline US mean trump right? region that?  Actually looking myself, looks like they've like [less 5 deaths running 7 day average whole time. certainly better-than-average per-capita basis. 

But then, deaths thing matters either. cases per capita worse average.  forget corporations free pollute much more, super-rich vastly super-richer we, nation, alienated long-term allies little impact world stage besides laughingstocks. list goes on.... r/unexpectedalicecooper  Angry vote  don‚Äôt win November peaceful way ever get rid infestation. Heard immunity isn‚Äôt think is. Heard immunity isn‚Äôt something plan attain, it‚Äôs result virus spreading unchecked infected enough population due immunity cannot spread exponentially still spreads slowly may possible immunity last months ample evidence case. Anyway reaching heard immunity spread virus going millions deaths even see slowing spread. I'm trust fund baby trust me. recently, worked grocery store. Worked 8 hour shifts, talking whole time. homemade fabric mask never slipped I'm even good sewing. Get different mask. They're cheap Etsy find sale every gas station grocery store now. haven‚Äôt shaken hands anyone 6 months. It‚Äôs strange especially work. Citizen's United birth Super PACs official undoing country's democracy. I'm sure non-bipartisanship came after, another factor. younger, see parties working across aisle occasional bill country needed it, stalemate every fucking time. Party country last 12-16 years getting worse. We're proper fucked matter gets office unless party controls 3 branches cuz soon one check balance introduced, congress/president nothing except sign executive orders. manage childcare center school aged children we‚Äôve close twice COVID. School doesn‚Äôt even start Monday. It‚Äôs get much worse much confusing. 

It doesn‚Äôt help parents lose shit close. Can‚Äôt see need all.

!remindme 2 weeks Congrads move good sir. availability teaching jobs? Target Lysol Clorox products. Well feel *so* much better you‚Äôve assured us they‚Äôll ok.

Might want rethink you‚Äôre getting Covid death rate info. federal government authority matters state health emergencies. authority rests solely governor authorities state. federal government explicitly forbidden usurping levying unilateral control state matters.

Doing would essentially like throwing state's governor, senate legislature trash. 

The POTUS legal authority tell state manage state matters UNLESS state's leadership cause unable prevent uncontrolled loss life, widespread destruction property, lawlessness, unconstitutional suspension civil liberties.  hope never see cruise ships again. live port town it‚Äôs amazing summer clean air water streets choked worst Americans We're first-year distance teachers. brand new skillset. override mayor governor.

Yeah yeah reinfections yeah yeah would seem odds overwhelmingly favor can‚Äôt get (at least long while) BC worse, 139 cases 1/3 population Ontario, today highest case day ever. Ontario par BC would need 400 cases. Omg! would ecstatic produce truck came street times week!

It‚Äôs politics now. It‚Äôs majority dumb fuck fuck Universal Came say this.

We one death (80+)  it‚Äôs still nothing compared spanish flu terms % population, original point media says I'm jealous... believe it? say I'm jealous Canada's coronavirus numbers. way, journalists saying this... dishonest people. truthfully, quite frankly, Canada done tremendous job handling pandemic. people would say tremendous, I'll generous say tremendous. look numbers... know numbers. people, that's look numbers. say, keep straight many numbers, that's do. numbers show America winning bigly. look testing, tremendous amounts testing... unheard of. Justin said me... way, like Justin. think he's nice guy. He's two-faced, find nice guy. said, able many tests? testing doing. incredible. many people look testing we're frankly, can't believe it. looking numbers strongly, frankly, tremendous numbers. Better numbers Canada, perhaps... people saying this, best numbers world. mainstream media... again, dishonest people... come stories. Nasty stories, quite frankly. say America winning. winning. winning many ways, even believe it. think symptoms means arent infectious? trump became president. here. even then, deal nasal inhalation bodily fluids field. Miss Roni give fuuuuuuck sort ""precautions"" taking place game literally close twenty people (plus refs) close proximity, that's even snap.

This gonna end well. moved season. BC afraid force us wear masks even though proven extremely effective. I'm thinking kind hell hospital April May NJ.

Nobody cheering virus. sick, twisted thing say. spike number week interesting see numbers hold true. covid isn‚Äôt lethal day 1, fatalities lag week two. hope hospitalization deaths stay low Overtake US? C'mon, America, get heads game. Take masks cough. make sound like children died.

No. make sound like that. never used words.

I said sick, partially recover, disabled life. say died.

Don't put words people's mouths, assume motivations them, based imagination nothing else. say God Death? You‚Äôll served something humbling soon enough you‚Äôre going wish weren‚Äôt types comments made. 'Twas smart move. probably done years ago. true number deaths undercount, IFR would less .4 percent infected frankly very, low.

330M (.2 20 percent infected)=66M infections.

We counted 197k dead earlier study found undercounting 30 percent. assuming still much undercounting means 256k total dead.

256k/66M=0.39 percent IFR low. So, anti-data? Like, acknowledge face mask use positive effect? covid causes organ damage? Stuff like that?

Imagine privileged life leave ‚Äúyou lose life savings life‚Äôs work, you‚Äôre still technically alive‚Äù  Stop acting like Biden would better. I'm happy Trump letting us live lives keeping everything closed down. always outliers virus. tragic, unfortunately happens every year people numerous diseases. anecdotes, brother took tested positive, asymptomatic except 1 day diarrhea (he got test cause contact positive person), girlfriend took well sore throat. 
My 17 year old cousin tested positive well fever 1 scratchy eyes, took got better within next day, family tested negative. 
Two dads employees tested positive, one 50 something year old guy hypertension, came close hospitalized doctor gave ivermectin, got better within 2 days, employee really mild case still took got better really fast. 

I honestly think ivermectin could effective treatment far, wish would give attention studies instead proving hydroxychloroquine doesn‚Äôt work. I'm going participate discussion reply every 10 fucking minutes.

Its constantly got international shipping out. There's obviously going cases mingling around. 

Thats say control. believe large ongoing outbreaks done fantastic job getting viral load levels something statistically insignificant.

 However also believe dont single case country. There's obviously level information suppression going in. We‚Äôre patients checked early go home morgue? Redditors seriously odd group fucking people. never met people like real life.

Come thats rookie numbers, CZ weve 1450 yesterday. Try harder!  Shocker! Yes cheating numbers every single fckng day... whole I'm satisfied China dealt Covid 19, what's ur problem, dude? Would u mind telling u r living right now?  Agreed less given it‚Äôs less contagious covid, given stupidity population, guarantee low covid flu winter.

All I'm saying people read article see woman mask nose. mean time that's fiance contracted COVID-19. means actions specific photograph contributing problem, thats all. people trying read coronavirus (the readers sub) see someone contributes spread coronavirus, understandably hard time sympathizing them.

As said before, course tragedy lost loved one disease, regardless possible circumstances. Winter nothing compared winter there, we're honest America unique case unique problems reflection real world. Yeah, imagine actual lock like countries government slowly paid money sending whole life back maintain safe go again. No, rich people problem. They're problem. nothing government pay giving f you. Yeah cases increasing winter coming along schools reopening. wonder going play out. Trump idiot. think ""if lock harder everything fine"" comparable way stubbing toe shooting injuries comparable.

Yet chose go...with eating drinking lots people. Earlier, discussed this, told would isolate away us 10 days. Yesterday tells going sleep truck!!! So, cave, sleeping living room wearing mask indoors next 10 days. Yet, today already pulling mask nose talking (he went rehearsal dinner last night...so clock started ticking then). hate this. feel stuck. joking right??? true % positive tests would way up. it‚Äôs not.

They unpopular industry among environmentalists well.

But pre covid also massive, massive business many people enjoy cruise experience. [This showed fever 8 days in. bounced around asymptomatically rest time. think quite ""all sudden"" remembering.

The virus ""staying dormant,"" passed around asymptomatically. What‚Äôs fatality rate virus compared flu? used put others risk everyday various flus viruses. one seemed give shit back then. Maybe lock every winter, since unknowingly spread virus high risk person.  wouldn‚Äôt sign waiver. Explain Rona shouldnt political, things should.

As non-Black POC, still wondering Biden Presidency give Trump Presidency not. Anyone answers? I'm sorry happened you. Something consider fair number people New York, New Jersey, Connecticut area virus past likely immune. figure live them, antisocial assholes. would productive long run. Getting secure fitting mask good idea expensive.

I hate confrontation know stressful, odds infected very, low, odds serious infection even lower given short interaction was.

Theeerrrre is

Wearing mask going concerts putting life hold. many ways good life we're creative.

But lot people insinuating making sacrifice means ""nOt liViNg liFe."" 

Tell people actually lives disrupted illness death, got tired it. friend hospital right fighting Covid he's essential worker, police officer. sacrificed health protect community. Tell would least wear mask avoid crowds save people like him, instead declaring proudly ""you nothing* problem gone want be.

I would expect extra dramatic response 13yo niece adult. Hes another long line people thought reason would prevail Replying everyone knows cop Yeah, feel like division strong gonna flop back forth every 4 years. hopefully not. Well testing, reporting, hiding, screwing numbers generally manipulative behavior helps.

How opening visitation good idea? inadequate medical care begin with. exactly enough PPE facilities last time checked. Stupid idea like it.  Florida absolute cesspool poor decision making beginning. 
Here's reality. could care less anyone dies. Lets whatever order prop fantasy normalcy. stop already..  r/leopardsatemyface get it. Hatin' game playahs. Nooooo? Really? That's like 5 per hospital. even slow woman Admissions, let alone ""overwhelm"" hospital. Survival mask fittest waiting court dates guess chose stay cages. beats dead. timeline, scientist gets death threats. president jealous attention focused medical expert. Except... chinese vaccine based deactivated covid19 viruses whereas oxford one genetically modified cold virus never existed now.... Y'all disgusting.

This women lost fiance want make jokes mask wearing?

When talk fabric mask slips down. could case photo clearly giving interview.

Look recent photos Trump/Obama one smiling another not. thing. honestly know.

Fuck off. lol ""Help OBernie 1 Kenobi - hope!"" LOL. Jurassic Park.  yep,the Truth virus really going plus responsible coming :) Brazil plateaued 1200 deaths/day quite while. India reaches similar plateau, it'd mean roughly 6000 deaths/day (India 5x times Brazil's population). Let's hope happen. India younger population relatively help. numbers rising fast. It‚Äôs interesting civilized debate two experts somewhat divergent opinions. Raises important questions move forward. That's almost every movie. Recently HBO season Chernobyl Lol jerküì¥s saying ""kids dont pose risk blah blah blah"" commenting now. Morons.  media good job scaring shit everyone, that‚Äôs sure don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking bro. South Korea reinstate lockdown measures. Spain, France, Britain seeing record numbers. Clearly simple. Schools starting winter coming. ask employer write fictitious letter saying made considered apartment. ways get around this, get guarantor, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy fair \*In Californian\* Wait guys burning something parents yelling unborn child's genitals?  ‚ÄúSo yes, IHME‚Äôs forecast frightening. question whether it‚Äôs credible.

The truth is, nobody ‚Äî even top coronavirus experts ‚Äî clue pandemic going evolve next four months. That‚Äôs frightening itself, course. it‚Äôs also projecting exact number deaths infections four months advance almost certain misleading.‚Äù

Look don‚Äôt even want keep arguing what‚Äôs going happen seem like I‚Äôm trying play truth one knows. Everyone wear mask stay away crowds home unless necessary. It‚Äôs really simple we‚Äôre idiots. Everyone gonna stay inside it‚Äôs cold people wear masks it‚Äôs cold? harsh winter probably best possible thing this.  I‚Äôm sad it‚Äôs come I‚Äôm also glad saw conversation. feel like I‚Äôve died I‚Äôm thinking persons hell. It‚Äôs nightmare it‚Äôs good know I‚Äôm alone this. together guess. Literally every country reopening without incident except US. 

All Trump say ""This serious issue I'm deferring top experts handle this."" Like every single nation did. 

Instant election win. America open now. Economy booms. 

Trump lobbed softball proceeded stick bat ass puke himself. Utter disgrace. 3k 9/11 murdered government (see proof, building 7 lots more), COVID today perhaps, knows truth yet. fiance's preschool teacher job back open month half now. They've already multiple positive cases children currently 4 teachers sick right now. bougie ass high end preschool fairly strict COVID precautions. best part 90% parents still working home. Rural, open space. Oh course it‚Äôs Miami... :/ seem angry. I'm sorry live shithole state allowed fun things. Try better  Yeah bought property back affordable nyc, family might ok. got 4 people jammed 400sq ft studio apartment living 55K pretty tough even budget. Also I‚Äôve lived much roommates ok, nowhere near standard living people call comfortable cities. \*salutes\* Surrender monkeys No. world 

My country taking measures lessen cases fix this. implemented half assed rules got life. ...because needs given intravenously, like Tamiflu, within first 24 hours infection.  

Instead giving sickest people. 

If cheap oral drug (which working on), could prescribe liberally, impossible give expensive intravenous treatment within first 24 hours even know patient going serious case. Oh hi Mr Spoons! work? Nice talk again! anyone advise whether ought consider requesting another covid test? flew Washington DC Seoul, South Korea Wednesday 9/2. arrived Korea morning 9/4, I've confined room government quarantine facility ever since. received test first evening came back negative. I've feeling great since then, aside bit stress able get outside whatnot. morning, woke swollen painful lump jawline, towards chin right side face. I'm assuming swollen lymph node. I've probed side area there's nothing, one swollen node. still feel fine. may bit tired slept 6 hours last night unusual feel little sleepy. symptoms. call ask tested again? swollen node nothing worry about? think good chunk America party miserable (but miserable forced pool party). literally wait six weeks ""open up"". Fucking sucks. healthcare worker tested positive, fuck people. don‚Äôt deserve education  :( Yeah, that's pretty close truth. attend support mother, side family, ones care sister couple first cousins. second cousins (closer age) basically written off, I'm major outsider everyone else. 

My blood relatives weird struggle hard associate them. envy people close family. I'm keeping life hold indefinitely ignorant people want get vaccines. would hope gets governments would introduce two tier society, anti-vaxxers relegated second class citizens rest us go largely unrestricted.  Agreed many smart ones I'm at. Someone tell Americans literally remaining country can't get shit together reopen lmao. inflated comparison European numbers. better way saying would European numbers understated, due lack testing capcity height initial outbreaks.

The majority US outbreaks occurred testing ramped significantly. 10-20 years Spanish flu spikes brain infections. suspected related Spanish flus damage cases.

Damage isn‚Äôt always apparent, lungs heal. things might not. knows. Long time damage known after... long Time. 

I mean, smoke heal, although takes time. bad sure understand question. idiocy continues..they facing charges?? Yea guys keep forgetting about...her emails.  know revenue didn‚Äôt think could recognize redeemed. 
Sorry business school long time ago üòû
But yes see way get someone back since they‚Äôve got gift card. 9/11 tributes hard stomach yesterday back mind. mean, sad 9/11 COVID, we've changed country since then.   It‚Äôs already normal me, don‚Äôt care anymore Chop finger wound heal, mean getting finger back. People need understand recovery mean go back normal fairly recent, Trump inspired joke Germany built wall got Russia pay it. 

the funnier part originally declared ""anti-fascist"" wall - know, keep fascist West Germans East Germany. ha! thought established last winter. Yeah likely they'll know then. safety pause happened, ""early autumn"" results last update someone Oxford sure delay week two. Thank saying üòä  Relax, man. I‚Äôm Brother Seamus! long deaths hospitalization stays low, need stop panicking cases. fucking hate wouldnt trust anyone wears post pandemic.

They give acne, limit talking breathing ability(i dont problem both, still limited)

I cant see people's face.

The list goes on. Actually interesting! know grammar cases called literally ""falls"" native language. Vaccines virus best 75% effective said 50-60% ‚Äúacceptable ‚Äú. even vaccine, still able get wouldn‚Äôt slow actual trial? Won‚Äôt take time enroll people? cover topic specifically latest video, basically media good, plus face leakage end lower level. Air Queen 90-97% media level, versus Dr. Puri 99.9+%, that's big difference. still much better cloth mask, would wear one cloth mask, yes, would buy one masks? probably would buy something Sounds like modern day witch hunt came Canada 2004

::HIGH FIVE:: Yeah, could ever compare Sweden rich west European urbanized countries. Every day totals pretty close March... ready December earliest It‚Äôs looking like one longer goes on. OOF corrected story; American. safe one goes cruise pandemic one boat. anti-Fauci comment getting upvoted? Glad see hivemind sub slowly dying out. months ago would labeled heretic.  think Captain Haddock meant vote US election expat even though I've left country. needs serve time IMO That's problem model. either grossly underestimates grossly overestimates. What's ridiculous? Acknowledgement there's deadly virus going around? Supporting local businesses? Taking precautions family safe?



I've seen deniers, anti-maskers, conspiracy theorists lot ridiculous things. terrified uncertainty change. Hmm wake earliest line chart, hasnt changed - what's making people sleep much later? ""The pivotal trial event-based many variables ultimately impact read-out timing. stated previously, based current infection rates, companies continue expect conclusive readout efficacy likely end October.""

Wants increase participants study shows bullets kill 100/100 viral cases dumbest thing I've read week, thanks plan never wildly popular plan begrudgingly accepted lot us frustrated stupid people could perceive country would shut save lives. Wildly popular? Give fucking break. 7 months later still people like fine unnecessary deaths still ghouls persist aren‚Äôt absorbing around 1,000 HUMAN BEINGS NEEDLESSLY DYING DAY. Even get vaccine, take 1 month full effect per person.

Get first shot.

28 days later, get 2nd shot.

14 days full immune response. title two implications. bad one definitely worse. prefer term, Trumpettes - Inside others (even home) prolonged time still top way transmission occuring. gathering meal, consider putting mask pre- post-socialization drinks engaged active conversation. food ate mask give power-up remainder gathering. 

(e: added clarifying phrase) worked, social distanced, worn mask since April. I'm NJ. Maybe already asymptomatic. Lmao twice likely 1% infected? Oh I'm scared let lock moldy basement sixteen weeks lmfao nah Normal social interaction heavily dependent mask.

People actually socialize strangers lot know this. Strange echo chamber, stories American super spreaders gain traction opposed much common significantly relevant super spreaders started pandemic spread begin with. people chose discuss those, labeled ""racist"" inciting etc.

The hypocrisy mental gymnastics reddit twists pretzels justify constant anti-US propaganda really sad witness. people really wonder need still mandated lockdown Ppl say time here. Like inside joke something. I‚Äôll probably never get Unfettered Protestant individualism. Waco here. sorry this. others Oh jeez, snow... hear you. lived US - spent year Florida once. white bullshit falls covers ever surface, end daydreaming nice cozy winter Tampa. beautiful there... mean, aside alligators. flesh-eating bacteria. crazy people guns. stuff. aside that, beautiful. :P said volunteer, receiving first injection trial, traveled town.  volunteer declared healthy upon returning trip received second injection,‚Äù said Rusmil.  added, due travel history, volunteer required take COVID-19 test local health authority tested positive virus.  said unable confirm whether volunteer injected potential vaccine placebo.

Time clear, even got real vaccine, could still get infected shortly after. That's most/all vaccine candidates use two shots spaced apart. takes time body generate proper immune response.

And then, course, there's chance get vaccine.  Thx! YESSSSS GUY FUCKING LIT MAN, WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO think might possible vaccin actually side effects guy don‚Äôt want lose billions continue work vaccin ? much money involved that‚Äôs scares me.. regret now.

Nice thing Indian trains nobody cares open outside doors. Even air conditioned coach, there's nothing quite like chilling door getting much fresh air want. Yeah, logic could also hundred million. getting voted way, shape, form compare response individual EU countries USA. USA completely bungled one. never got pandemic control.

The difference USA countries that:

1. countries managed flatten curves reopenening
2. staggered reopenings based scientific evidence guidance experts
3. managed lockdowns better: longer, better enforcement, strict protocols citizens
4. citizens actually dd told good community
5. states within countries countries worked together coordinated effort - USA playing whack-a-mole national coordination

Finally, even rising case numbers countries better equipped: nationalized healthcare ability continue compensate populace need reinstate lockdown measures. Finally, rising case numbers expected manageable time better access testing, tracing &amp; quarantine, better prepared healthcare network, importantly types people getting infected time round different (young adults/children) reopening schools &amp; bars/clubs. data understand going on. 

America clearly place can't control COVID aside perhaps India, Brazil, Russia. places mentioned certainly demonstrated control COVID. happens President downplayed virus. Can‚Äôt blame Dems one hear ya. heard scientist talking Ted talk went link find study. claims they've studying 4-5 years.

BAHAHAHAHAHHAH economy already dead. Ugh. Many us care others. others obsessed 'muh Rights' think word 'our'. point Americans worst disease planet. Ignorant stupid. Yeah know I'm talking about. thought like 20 people would wish something worse current pandemic? Take peek Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) map that, friend.

My desirable city one dark dark red ones. *koff koff* prefer think ""imaginative."" model far beginning new model? ok Exactly, they‚Äôre life, everyone around page it; don‚Äôt see anything wrong it. Unfortunate wouldn‚Äôt wanna spend last days quarantine either still employers paid employees enough.

Unfortunately that's window now. restaurants losing money continue quite while. game attrition now.

We open pay little kitchen staff even losing money every week. Working 7 days week income sucks. Paying staff option us restaurants. know damn well majority people getting spreading aren‚Äôt jobs rather swath parties gatherings. can‚Äôt provide hard data insinuation. average person make general hypothesis based fact cases plummeting 30 cases day days. going 100-200+ range students came back campus.

But, people northern areas, dont go much tend low levels too. Thank you. I‚Äôd love take advice someone recklessly puts people‚Äôs lives risk party friends. shining pillar community selflessness face global pandemic truly inspiring. almost funny people honestly believe eventually ""going back normal."" mean trend reducing testing? one? That's good news. enough volunteers get infected, trial end enough data efficacy. vast majority people social media nuts follow whoever says best thing presents best social media presence instead using common sense. 0 hope country point. Yep. still US, coworker based Toronto. wife got brain cancer... received 4 surgeries, end help. tragic. lived US, though, would've tragic - followed bankruptcy due medical bills.

Personally, I'm healthy horse, know always way. feels great know I'll taken care here. far know, Canada's healthcare system cover prescription drugs, etc, still soooo much better. ...oh, one dies ration expensive insulin. :( It'll fun #ClapForCarers. angrily posted several times topics trump ""not allowing"" universal mail voting (your entire account orangemanbad, super brave you), say universal mail voting necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank proving point. know, everyone else also sees right it. Reddit good brain, warps view reality heavy moderation circle jerking. wondering that, ""Isn't one state that's actively reducing testing?"" 


And yep, one state soooo proud reduced numbers... ignoring reduced testing. I'm saying often days, just, JFC. vaccine fix this. Vaccines best 50-60% effective. Even vaccine still wear mask socially distance virus presence reduced population still get sick still spread it. chance illness however cut half.  humanity ""thought world flat"" etc stupid. cause world seemed pretty flat. put rest well 2000 years ago. wonder likelihood obesity also go eat restaurants time. information previously posted?

It‚Äôs easy get pigeon holed one issue: election, systemic racism, pandemic. 
Let‚Äôs remember we‚Äôre human, flawed, bit scared 2021 bring. Stand together instead tearing others down. look supplement called n-acetyl-cysteine lung health. It‚Äôs sulfur based case allergies NAC worked wonders 80yo mom smoked 45 years.

Run pharmacist within first 14 days lung health start improve. 

Unfortunately way lungs repair expel crap may cough nastiness days, taking expectorant help make sure take cough suppressants. Take joke guy virus would caused recession regardless forcing businesses shut months help matters, that's sure. earth news? What‚Äôs subs community? think expected even illness related vaccine one person ill representative even would discard clinic group getting dosis vaccine continue others Takeout fine. take packaging wash hands. Unless major issues make susceptible would say need that. I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely spread food less likely initially thought spread surface contact. That's wild exotic. make sure science books talk creationism too. think possible downward mutation, acquired immunity vaccinations Fauci's estimate pretty good. year think virus lot less completely available hosts infect. may already sacrificing virulence ability spread well.

It always novel. probably path low level endemic disease. we're still year away inherent risk going way down. However, things improve way there. US think fall/winter we'll serious ""herd resistance"" going (not full blown immunity, R down). majority densely populated areas think virus covered decent amount ground. think early signs herd immunity threshold lower, maybe 40-60% range. make achieving herd status vaccination acquired immunity easier. top comment. top comment correction. Fauci actually say this. guess everyone really dumbass. Isn‚Äôt trump said months ago? Source? Yes! need that! survive without basketball bars open? Ef fake pandemic! Ef masks 5G(ates) chips them! ask question southern border please.  didn‚Äôt say anything. hospitalization rate decrease DeSantis started intercepting hospital data went CDC? get covid passing someone briefly sidewalk. passes generally sustained contact half us voted candidate.

The candidate got 48.1% vote, even get half, nowhere near half US population. Gotta fix that...let‚Äôs open bars! /s neither california's believe engineered virus less dangerous? come back random 1 day spike (I assume either isu ui) gets 3 week average. boomers got American Dream, decided going pay retirement they'd need destroy everyone else's. mean, buy enough tests test EVERYONE cruise starts never let leave ship, that's waste thousands tests could go better use. agree. Nothing changed then. Taiwan. See New Zealand, Vietnam, Mainland China, etc. countries acted decisively early enough made feasible keep Covid numbers near zero also best economic outcomes. Vietnam China two countries expected positive growth year. NZ may dependent tourism positive growth, economy operating normally nearly Western countries least negative impact. Ah yes, thinking entire nationality shouldn‚Äôt discriminated makes ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù.‚Äô good old Boomer logic lol also larger outbreaks right may provide better comparison stats.

The absolute silver lining large outbreaks. Luckily schools daycare reopened yet. Oh wait... TIL! I‚Äôm woman doesn‚Äôt wear makeup wasn‚Äôt aware. wear sunscreen though. Jobless, homeless, hopeless hungry, least didn‚Äôt get virus low chance actually killing you.

/s mean vaccine timeline? estimate date stage conclude? Yeah everyone locked masked novel virus would go shoooo dissapear. 

Without herd immunity doesnt matter do. still there. else buy? 250 pills 10,000 IU vit like 10 bucks  also 100 years ago advent much modern medicine. Hand-washing vogue couple decades point. Nice job, numbers keep coming down! set start rebooting economy now. 1 100 meaning affects 1% people. That‚Äôs small number pretty much small gets Thats National post you. would agree update ferret study would great Covid19. vaccine works can't mass produced big enough scale good vaccine Well, would possible supplement it, like iodine salt. far nobody wanted it, although would make lot sense, since lot people enough sun exposure build enough Vitamin D. Here's latest case/death charts Texas, running 7-day Oxford University certainly losing billions, chance it. Man, I‚Äôm Chicago, still get bit tripped people use ‚Äúearly autumn‚Äù refer anything ‚Äúmid-September.‚Äù think information front them? $$$ I'd worried Thanksgiving. Halloween mostly outdoors. Thanksgiving indoors millions people gathering talking hours. wife hung friends maybe twice week that's 20 bucks, pretty low price pay Holy erection, Batman! way common, that's pretty moot. point still there. read time want. question, ask too. could move? think France seeded much spread run radar lockdown. see GER Bavaria, Baden Wuerttemberg NRW still remain major problem area. Germany faster expanding testing F tests per capita since early pandemic. 

Due clustering infection seems epidemic needs degree spread among low-risk groups unchecked testing system take off. problem yet quantify threshold reached things moving fast. Fauci said important children go school earth read covid patients puctured lungs matter statement? Yep. go outside title misleading all. talking covid ICU admission rates vitamin supplements help reduce that. Thats general statement covid cases severity. Nowhere say vitamin supplements beneficial every person takes them. that‚Äôs tip iceberg.

i‚Äôm looking thanksgiving christmas families gonna want get together.

people could literally test way house, $5 piece it‚Äôs extremely affordable could take multiple test. 

let‚Äôs say wanted go moms thanksgiving, i‚Äôd take test everyday week leading thanksgiving, one day thanksgiving. 

that‚Äôs $40 i‚Äôll reassurance knowing i‚Äôm sick hangout like normal. around hour day got sick eat vitamin D, zinc vitamin C everyday turned negative.  terrifying.  discussing like are/were med school setting bullshit strawman arguments here. Personally hope drs smarter that.

Some college students tools anybody hosting big parties right deserves demonized college student not. Ah yes, historic reputable thehindubusinessline.com Here's overall case/death charts state, running 7-day California badly. They're 35.72 deaths per 100k population, much less US per capita average 57.71.

That ranks 25th among US can‚Äôt demand say things disagree argue me. claimed already knew opinion based previous comments I‚Äôve made cannot prove lied knowing it. caught lie can‚Äôt handle it. would kinda hilarious weren‚Äôt sad. Even then, might *legal*, many companies cautious discussing medical information like 1) respect patient‚Äôs privacy (legality notwithstanding) 2) sure don‚Äôt get sued discussing information realistically, rest world doesn‚Äôt actually need.  Additionally, Pfizer candidate also prevented severe disease rather provided sterilizing immunity. fine. county sheriff's said enforce mandatory mask order. I've seen lots police officers without masks. care, never did. First off, everyone drinks young age. nothing anything nice cop hassle underaged drinking.

Second, people take cars college even do, still walk. Bars college towns tend parking, drive wanted to.

It clear never went college fat cannot walk. Walking normal way get around near college. lol brought virus USA possibly disregarded quarantine rules still unclear.

See, something kills German society. lived (in Germany) almost 10 years thing leaves speechless (in good sad ways- typo, mean sad, bad) fundamental trust society government have, people ""right thing"" pretty much right thing. Whether buying ticket subway (there turnstiles, occasional spot checks transport see valid ticket), agreeing busted police something cooperate action, ""observing"" quarantine rules one's volition, etc...GAH! kills me. 

It kills current approach reasonable. non-cynical. beautiful. normally effective! rely social contract among people complete ass. kills point people see many instances ""the right thing"" lose sense trust other. kills cases like give people idea ""rules"" apply them. kills me.

Just German resident make less threat. reason (apparently) common sense concern others would/should indicated abstain partying symptoms. reasonable sensibility. kills me.  thought blame much students, expected students do, university administrators re-opening classes able held online (unless classes needs access specialized equipment lab, research students work lab, etc.) mask wearing leading less efficient social distancing bullshit west spreading lol. People selfish don‚Äôt want inconvenience.

I guess stop mandating use seatbelts makes people feel drive recklessly, right?

Look photos blatant examples social distancing US, people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. Putting mask won‚Äôt make people suddenly go huge concert bar. fatalistic. Realistic. 

Not trying pull ""age card"" say: I've noticed people cling concept ""returning normal"" age 35. 

I old enough remember drastically HIV AIDS changed everything. People wanted ""return normal"" well. Many adults today idea jarring condomless sex go ""STDs nuisance"" ""Rawdogging kill you."" impossible seemed everyone blood cum could poisonous. over, TV movies, science fiction kept talking ""Cure AIDS"" something eventually found. expected cure 1980s. expected vaccine 1990s. expected 00s. still one. 

What change? Many, many things, reckon. shall see. would love NOTHING go back things 2018. miss dating, nightclubs, concerts, restaurants, bars. I'm also quite aware living denial reality going foolish - going get people killed. 

So wait see happens. good reply thank ‚ÄúVery deadly December ‚Äú Hopefully sooner. long isn‚Äôt messed up. Or, option three: can‚Äôt say sure vaccine not. cases (which usually happens), carefully proceed keep close eye another event. May enroll another 5K people safe. watch hawk‚Äôs eye; there‚Äôs another case TM vaccine arm, vials getting thrown trash immediately. vaccine expected 50-60% effective. take many years develop one higher efficacy. also factors statement. Even get vaccinated, still insignificant chance getting sick. first vaccines stopgaps better vaccines Canada much worse America right ? form UV light used cancer treatment? surprise found something there. Like said worried cook home instead cooking everything idiot Cases reported honestly several US states, including Florida. still first wave pandemic, first wave still running rampant, hundreds people still dying needlessly every day, large part they've deceived believing cases declining significantly general situation improving. 

As result, rest world looks US mixture pity horror, things keep getting worse every month.

Wear masks, keep distance others, take vitamin D, fuck's sake, go bars restaurants. None things difficult. Abbot $5 15 minute covid test he‚Äôs wanting approve Texas. turns effective, could return normal life creating bubbles.

you want family come thanksgiving? $5 piece people get tested morning thanksgiving, night before, morning of.

if 3 come back negative come in.

sports teams get tested game, anyone test positive call off. 

it takes guess work it. anytime meet someone isn‚Äôt house run risk knowing they‚Äôve last 2 weeks.

i personally would probably buy $100 worth tests hand.

want friend come watch game? bring test car, take it, wait 15 minutes, it‚Äôs clear come in. 

don‚Äôt drag feet this, don‚Äôt doomsday pessimist.

until there‚Äôs safe effective vaccine, accurate, easy use, rapid test next best solution. Nah, must nice Black Site Pakistan name can‚Äôt pronounce Christianity education cuts baby doll Well, that's rude. Thanks reading rest post. point comparing two things classification human pathological viruses common. Might want head back math class. 110 days Jan 1, currently 191,000 deaths, multiply 110 current average 710 get 78,100, add 191,100 current deaths get 269,200 deaths. That's pretty far 415,000 deaths story talking about. ""Possibility""

Don't get excited. sort thing get shareholders worked extended periods time. ""Good news coming soon,"" people buy stock. ""Any minute now, keep holding,"" people buy stock least sell.

This also strategy Trump uses people ""don't panic."" content want see. Go find post N.Y. stories. I'm one wears mask office received flu shot week ago. take 2 weeks effective. 

Everyone work with, including old obese diabetic high blood pressure asthma can't use cleaner perfume around bc it'll affect asthma refuses flu vac. Upsetting also affects asthma. 

Everyone one said get flu vaccine take it. *eye roll*

Even though get every year gotten flu.......

It's sad way wait step job ladder myself. social quarantine time. 2020. I'm actually social before. alive enjoy civil liberties. governments New Zealand, Australia, Canada many countries seem understand point. #getclappedforcarers well horrifying exactly. might deaths yesterday, British Columbia's COVID numbers highest yet past week. love New York whos amazing job despite America largest city US? **US NEWS CORPORIZED**

Real professional, INDEPENDENT NEWS exist US!

Americans, ""own"" DES INFORMATION going decades!!

""Feed SHIT, keep 'm DARK"" Gee wonder hospitals, schools cruise ships necessary. eh way talks pretty clearly like 'masks help lot daily routine changes need make can't solved putting mask'. Never interpreted masks=bad, like 'you probably need stay house next months lose job interact people wont status quo masks' We're still hoping contact tracing contain spread well hoping people come senses. 

I think indoor mask mandates done least tho... must Googled found Facebook. School reopening monday everybody scared.

So far around 1500 cases day slight increase last weeks.

Hard imagine contained long looking france/spain/uk. lol Absolutely zero. South Korea would seen public enemy treated (if broke quarantine order), that's one reasons SK 100 times better EU. gonna look rookie numbers effect exams Indias govt forced held show. 20 lakhs students across country coming exam centres parents really give boost numbers. sure relevant well past early weeks. visitors - there's chunk people cities like Vancouver kelowna pretending pandemic over. club strip Van rammed people every weekend. multiple underground raves happening every weekend since June - indoors outdoors. Mask use time low last weeks too...

It's definitely majority, insignificant number virulent virus, minority people idiots takes. But..but.. used like Karaoke :( Excellent distraction typo sir! know gave MD. wondering cases go think deaths go given constant death rate. Oh quickly edited numbers. odds serious complications vaccine Covid? What?!? dont get memes you? course, comrade. china great, it? way censors internet citizens taht can't see like freedom?

It's great. Everyone wants live china lol BC requires masks buses public transport now. also enforcement. driver ask people wear mask, nothing done. tough situation. Earth prove whether TM related vaccine not? nobody properly knows TM MS even comes from. loved sketch, R.I.P. Phil Hartman, lost real treasure. Wait, first call Canada amateurs go ""oh look us _so many cases_"", next reply ""have interest gatekeeping""? agree, maybe sport less contact (say, tennis) idea bad, football... Yeah exactly. Idiots keep using 'gotcha' argument really proof safe least, good enough now.

If worked willing put themselves, *that* would red flag. Yay conducting exams whose effects see end September! Gotta top list Gr√º√ü Gott aus dem sch√∂nen Schwabenland! BC, schools reopened yesterday that's factor skyrocketing cases. us, reopening general not-insignificant amount people completely pretending pandemic ignoring social distancing mask guidelines partying like end world - suppose apt. Likely not, unless medical workers border control staff. pandemic travel place, multiple connecting flights. arrive city party several locations. Death rate 0.0000000000005% bro, I'm young cares, go die. End ICU, problem. healthcare worker looking patients? Well, .... then. Yes grew would consider southern style north state, family lived mile away neighbors. stores ten miles away more. went wonderful school system even neighboring cities way different policies would allow evolution taught. So, pardon me, I‚Äôm pretty fucking sure creationism isn‚Äôt taught blue ribbon schools concentration isn‚Äôt exactly south. Believe worst. friends small businesses always get bombarded ""influencers"" (sometimes less 1k followers) asking free stuff. Lockdowns done. They're unpopular and, I'm sorry, stupid uneducated participate anti lockdown rallies point. many countries they'll end causing long term damage COVID could - case point, live there's welfare state expats, second lockdown would decimate economy. They're band aid solution clearly fatigue set in. man travel place, multiple connecting flights. arrive city party several locations. Death rate 0.0000000000005% bro, I'm young cares, go die. End ICU, problem. Yay exams! wait till effect shows 3-4 week kf September never seen cruise ship before. 

But year cruises come me. first one arrived March since may floating coast here. Zaandam, emerald princess, Nieuw statendam, world dream Amsterdam. stuck scheveningen coast Netherlands. checked names marine traffic website. 

Some ships gone servicing think half sold already. 

But seriously think cruising come back soon. what? old people still people lives completely disregarded lives young people died. Agreed definitely live society wait college students fly, train drive back homes winter holidays everyone traveling cramming indoors family Nova Scotia here. mandatory masks, there‚Äôs zero enforcement mechanism behind it. Mask usage result spotty, folks forgotten distancing. 

There‚Äôs masks distancing workplace 300 people, soon pass front door. 

Our public health official toured facility apparently impressed. must blind. Nah ‚Äúthank you‚Äù pay make 20, 18 actual, like 15 taxes. ever said 0.03%? Quarantining Europe: ""If huge inconvenience may please recommend consider maybe going house 2 weeks? Thanks. checks consequences."" kids certain age can't stay home alone? hard understand? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm sorry think that's normal.

If sort agenda push that's fine. I'll leave it. clear... never said normal. once. fact expressed opposite multiple times. really don‚Äôt think change general take away. relying official govt counts believe Canada much reliable India there. India believes form substance. cases, show fewer numbers good go. cases deaths. Till excess deaths comes way know many folks actually died due covid 700 india's population gives 25k.

So *are* worse no? said 98k cases yesterday.

Anyway interest gatekeeping agony whose worse off. point govt forcing exams students Let's say ... highly controversial. extent, agree points guys making (we started well pandemic, german bureaucracy caught Powers-That-Be pulled strings, stuff got weirder every week. Example: one first things announced re-opening national lockdown car dealerships. important thing two months buying new cars...) hand, protests filled Reichsb√ºrger (think Flatearthers. According mindset, current state Germany ""under occupation"" Germany, Inc., Kaiser reinstated. Thus, legislation since WWII void laws 1918 apply) people believe ""Bill Gates went China bought cheapest, unreliable virus could get wipe half earth's population implant mind control chip whoever remaining""-story.

And there's people claim unfair thrown one bowl Nazis/Reichsb√ºrger/Idiots make large group demonstrations. middle pandemic, though. people one-step way thinking, superficial. Death rate? &lt;0.5%. old people. old? No. Done. 

For every death 5 people ICU. every death \~40 people hospitalized. Even healthcare costs alone big burden many people hospitalized. 

Not even mentioning worrying long-term effects, even mild cases, that's whole subject. Come man. spent $5mill show great pandemic also allowed 250k motorcyclist Covid jerk increase case numbers. Humbly speaking, South Dakota  Make sure vote people stuck south 49th fighting chance. Dr. Grootbee, thank taking time strenuous job CDC make insightful post. question though--what math system CDC using 0.03% larger number smaller number? Usual reminder: Global Times tabloid owned CCP. Use reliable sources possible. redditMDs scoffing idea lungs ever permanent damage 

About many redditMDs claiming lifelong lung damage effects last 6 months could even assess 'long-term' meant. like Bonnie Henry low-key masks beginning. know why. ‚ÄúPopulation density matters‚Äù Canada‚Äôs population spread evenly throughout total area. ""I think people go cruise trips good mix people get rid of"" - Bill Burr Oh definitely, one major things deterred firefighter. asthma CEV levels close normal remember correctly, realized around burning plastic, insulation, chemicals countless carcinogens wouldn‚Äôt good me. 

I also wanted wild land firefighter realized would even worse situation since don‚Äôt even masks Died coronavirus Likely Uyghurs ethnic minorities. thought already 2nd case? vaccine trial paused second I'm paid enjoy downvoting stupid comments like yours. happened US people would gawking instead empathizing must realise that's stupid question right. really seem missing point article act civilized people go meeting people sick?

A mask might 50% effective, meeting someone 100% effective. Considering many people eager pretend problem anymore, is, important focus case numbers. think deaths come from? Fine, take Cambridge one instead üôÑ people wondering for.... population cant get vaccine right away ( people treatments, pregnant women... etc) Dude. Seriously. US country school shootings regular basis, point kids end develop escape plans, active shooter drills young age, etc. That's literally normalized terrorism: terror everywhere, pervasive. ""Nothing it, sorry"" yet another massacre somehow, way, country horrifying regularity.

I'm sorry think that's normal. tree liberty requires many human sacrifices, want part it. like said post, pandemic handling obvious manifestation Canada shit together. mass shootings every single day another, less advertised aspect.  He's paid vote anti-china posts spread lies promoting ""The Supreme Leader"" net.

""CHINA GREAT. BOW CHINA. STEAL VACCINE DATA FORCE EARLY VACCINE PEOPLE."" shit tired. Keep making excuses incompetence. big gold chains hanging - look like coincidence me. Ys, would wonderful live country massive lack freedom, censored internet mass fact reddit likely means one Chinese spreading lies misinformation net, army bots downvoting anti-china posts. forced masks pretty dumb like anti masker

This somewhat misinformed. Close-contact essential businesses (Dentists, Clinics, Haircuts etc) enforcing employees (and often customers) wear masks face shields.

For majority businesses final decision whether enforce policy upon customers left management.

This makes sense every store walmart costco get crowds people shopping often unavoidable stay 2 meters apart, less busy stores forego masks still fine. ""‚ÄùEarly declines transmission rate COVID-19 nearly universal worldwide,"" report, suggests ""the role region-specific NPIs implemented early phase pandemic likely overstated."" ‚Äú

I don‚Äôt see suggests that. implement policies limit gatherings etc, even remove relax them, people still remain careful. Also long lag policy implementations Covid numbers.
Plus look US... Nope, communist country like ""these people"" LAUGHS DUMBFUCKINSTAN ( send help asap ) ""volunteered"" like people Bypassing standard stages vaccine trials. 

Who's surpsised China this, found attempting steal vaccine one going able diagnose you, would safe ask test learned subset people, increasingly becoming loudest voices reddit, constantly pushing goal posts back hoping endemic virus eliminated...when...like pointed numerous times here...most viruses never fully eliminated. Black Plague still crops up.

So insist people still wearing masks social distancing post vaccine..YOU welcome that. Reddit still you. people looked situation went ""Shit, life's changed indeterminate future. better adapt.""

Some people looked went ""I guess I'll follow along things get back normal.""

The former group getting better they're seeing challenge overcome overcoming building good habits. They're accepting it. latter giving they're seeing something wait getting tired waiting. They're still denial. guess young people can't depended upon self-sacrifice thorough delayed gratification.

Who knew? /s ‚ÄúReports‚Äù better tracing much testing? I.e. mild/asymptomatic cases get tested? Canadian US population densities fairly similar (as in, populations urban) I'm normalizing anything. 1 dead person mass shooting many. that's discussion having. extremely rare occurrence Americans luckily never experience. Doesn‚Äôt Canada take everyone?? wouldn‚Äôt take everyone? Case counts closer think. Scaling 700 india's population gives 25k. US still winning

U! S! A! U! S! A! U! S! A! Winter coming. getting cold earlier year... expect naturally decline less people go out. California it‚Äôs getting worse? ""Instead, currently vaccine candidate phase 3 trial UAE 15,000 people. phase 3 trial mostly safety trial, trial see effective candidate preventing infection.""

Regardless, vaccine passed stages given en mass, article explains.

Though, live authoritarian dystopian country, often get choice.

If China force mass sterilisations, focring mass vaccination needed China. Home schooling thing months reason continue it. schools already back since may. Girlfriend cabin fever due covid, come parent‚Äôs house moms coughing nonstop past 2 days. regularly travels states doesn‚Äôt seem take covid seriously. looks like we‚Äôre risking getting since made trip üôÑ People live small portion Canada.

I'd imagine researchers would standardize remove differences locations due differing levels testing. Unfortunately state there's way us say certain. Thanks professor. I'll look need pedantry US Like ""Fuck China"" xenophobic lol would made house target harassment called. every time someone sore throat headache need get tested self-isolate? That's unworkable. pressing concern long term cardiovascular related vascular based organ effects take years properly assess. It‚Äôs good see short term lung changes appear reverse course unknown degree; however, isn‚Äôt indicative organ systems. I‚Äôm you, correct I‚Äôm wrong, thought 14 days stop spread‚Äù campaign. Also, hearing executive branch doesn‚Äôt power create mandate, convince republicans this? example, read, ‚ÄúThere nothing, however, authorizes President Trump now, President Biden tomorrow, mandate face coverings nationwide via executive power.

Well call ""The Great Wall America - made China""  citation that?  I'm following every single rule country I'm never going adapt ""new normal"". people meant cooped up, strict quarantine March/April months I'd probably kill myself. Wir heizen nicht f√ºr drau√üen! Exactly. 

The initial 2-week initial lockdown prevent hospitals overwhelmed good thing, prolonged lockdown completely eradicate virus fool's errand. beginning stages humans trying nothing grow exponentially. Virus growth instead rises falls waves, rises slower humans curb it. Nowhere world coronavirus *just* grown exponentially frontrunner western vaccines, sure rushing cutting corners comes safety. companies fail so, health authorities scientist check rigorously. Can't surprised considering commander chief US military time huh? Assumed would happen great news. Looking forward smooth sailing out. Briefly looked cdc website. Difference covid flu.

We hope start taking seriously. bad flu season plus Covid would suck. good capable making right decisions Public Health Emergency. need keep quiet follow instructions. worry, comfy bubble come take granted restored soon crisis dealt with. all. come family's boomers. Mizzou (Columbia, MO) quarantining somewhere campus close to. apparently they're whining like accommodations. Give break, resort. aside, Florida much better late. Here's latest case/death charts, running 7-day deaths trending way down.

Florida currently ranks 16th overall terms per capita Lmao. Isn‚Äôt possible college towns extensively tested communities America? m8 I‚Äôve got masters IR IL ok health authorities masks. It‚Äôs pretty clear listen briefings every day. Humans gone full backwards seems. xenophobia showing Ignorance runs deep blood dips*t. Hindus one entity rather conglomerate multiple religions, science, philosophy even lack thereof. So, saying Hindu 'nationalist' pretty BS. Also, unlike religions, nothing Hinduism deals religion - scriptures converting murdering non believers, etc. concept belief islam like religion. So, fck bigot. lol. Flatten curve enough keep beds full!  best quote think is:

It‚Äôs Greater Good Good. people take covid precautions

That‚Äôs big many states main outbreaks B.C. really low population areas. Alert Bay, Haida Gwaii got hammered Northern BC getting hit right now. Don‚Äôt close minded fool, sheep.




No one takes train anymore. passive aggressive fellow Canadians Meanwhile America leads world COVID stuff Trump. Damn covid break heart :(  6 weeks here. Pretty mild stories read long haul. 

I cant seem get help found much info treatment. Dr. basically tells sit shut calls ""Anxiety"". Another doc got meds slow heart (from 60 resting 120 getting bottle water, 150+ take shower) ordered monitor. 

Are treatment options? Everyone suffering it? Ami go home *if*people take precautions. Americans seem do.

It could bad. could non existent.

 Even Stevie Wonder see group Nostradumbasses dragging goalposts corpses dead people hoping finally claim ones get right. sons teacher Vancouver Island full stop discouraged masks yesterday. entire class showed wearing told wasn‚Äôt necessary wasn‚Äôt wearing one. BC screwed. I'm commenting article. I'm commenting ""...our flu season almost non-existent"" remark u/mewtwoyeetsauce.

And precise, merely asked question. kinda think isnt absolute worst thing could do. outside, amount time actually interact people pretty minimal. I'm taping sort scoop hockey stick hand candy stay distanced. Trump still office 20 years now, they'll still going ""Don't forget check voter registration!"" people reddit teenagers. going anywhere. baffles mind many people give staff grief enforcing requirements ensure customers staff safe. enforce it, call complain dont like people tell do. actually extremely disheartening never able look human race again. I'm sure correct, I've read high level alcohol evaporate quickly, though may depend humidity area know.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically suspended solution keep evaporating little bit. northeast maybe, southern states. whole deaths per population like #15 think. Yeah I‚Äôd like know two.

People keep referring 50% 50% population immune (assume complete vaccination take rates), also talking dropping severity flu like levels. it? 50% effective 50% less spread metric? 50% less severe metric?

In eyes get job done get us back normal. decrease risk acceptable level, wish transparency effectiveness % means knew enough tell everyone wear masks avoid gatherings. People listen, pandemic raged. best defense still wear masks avoid gatherings. People still listen. Results expected. know right, still crazy too! Imagine over, maybe spring 2021, compare war, imagine relief everyone already see everyone smiling, street greeting everyone... okay know wont like know i'll happy meet strangers, go more, etc. Obviously. know vast Canada is?

If believe made mistake, please [message cooperation.  Oh yeah, saw one too. :) bad fines stray Americans drive straight Alaska $1K, give take. far, anyway... Well since can‚Äôt spell anything correctly I‚Äôm going assume facts wrong syntax. 

25k cases attributed sturgis. Every 1st world country homeless people. Covid isn‚Äôt deadly. 6% Covid deaths Covid alone. 9,000 deaths .15% rate death. 

I‚Äôm worried it. know feeling care another nationality. feeling though. Austin would safe zone you‚Äôd also walled there, freedom move outside wall states.

In seriousness, Texans invade state middle pandemic don‚Äôt wear masks ones need protection from, sane, normal people believe science. follow what‚Äôs happening Texas feel terrible trying safe. I'm surrounded them, please light beacons. Relationships involve commitment trust didn‚Äôt want get tested, wasn‚Äôt meant be. Yes understand influenza viruses work. using example vaccine efficacy varies. vary lot, beyond flu vaccines. rare vaccine like MMR 98% effective.

These first round vaccines projected efficacy shitty flu vac really. 50-60%

Edit: keep mind much virulent contagious flu. definitely help, downgrade right seasonal flu scenario right away. It‚Äôs almost like need sort universal basic income times like these. words, Tan says, ""If vaccinate 100 people, 50 people get may sound like impressive rate infection prevention, potential benefits individuals community getting possible [COVID-19] vaccine reduce severity disease"" 50% get sick, says physician Bill Miller Ohio State University College Public Health. ""It may mean people less likely hospitalized, require ICU care die.""


Edit: sounds like I‚Äôm wrong. People think 50% good. It‚Äôs definitely huge improvement zero right now. assure I‚Äôm Canadian Russian, agenda, saw article posted here. *really* want clean glasses... Yeah, that‚Äôs reasonable largely agree. Yeah Oxford NHP data didn‚Äôt technically show sterilizing immunity (although I‚Äôm sure would given ridiculous amount virus delivered straight NP respiratory epithelium), I‚Äôm slightly less hopeful one ‚Äî think data persistent CD4 response Pfizer‚Äôs candidate presence neutralizing antibodies supra-convalescent titers promising.

That said, suppose we‚Äôll see soon enough; it‚Äôs academic get real efficacy data. group gets vaccine 10% get tested postive, vs group B gets placebo 20% test positive trial, vaccine considered 50% effective, half get vaccine presumed still vulnerable infection. lot people vote system broken people confidence vote even matters. meaningless result less testing. American staying US base run hotel. Stop lying. fuck think many teachers got NYC beginning pandemic?

Everyone knew delay closing schools helped fuel outbreak. gave current situation computer, let decide best thing do, would immediately pick 30-50 vaccine candidates exposure studies 100 people each. would get results 2 months worst case scenario seriously harm 5,000 people maximum.

The thing computers, suggesting sounds unethical. Nobody wants directly responsible risking lives deciding whose life risk. Instead indirectly let millions people get long-term damage virus. agree hold court. claim symptoms indicative different condition, bad air quality due fires, allergies. Also, isn‚Äôt single jab? think he's fine, least comparing peers neighbor country. People need stop partying wear masks. simple also difficult dumb people. Lock up! (The tourist, Hillary Clinton) Fauci also promote masks strongly beginning. agree opinions disagree others. perfect vessel knowledge, is?

What mean, disagree sad US can't even stop first wave? yet people behaving (not wearing masks, getting tired quarantining, acting like think get it). People same.  Yes!! think should. 

Talked &lt;21 year old girl yesterday told believe covid goes everywhere without mask. 

I bit tongue hard bled I'm learning stating truth facts nothing. first wave ended less 5 cases per day month, 30-40 cases per day week now, spike, second wave  possible, almost vaccines occasional serious side-effects. rate less 1 10,000 severe reactions, might still consider worth it, given Covid higher rate serious complications. rate higher that, see continuing. ""get back normal"" includes stuff, going hell lot later late 2021, ever. figure late 2021 stuff like going movies eating worried it. Cool sexism. Unfortunately, question people stupid enough sign this. ""Ahead vote, US unsuccessfully attempted remove paragraph protecting women area sexual reproductive health, objections abortion.

Libya Iraq also voted paragraph's removal. However, 120 countries voted keep 25 countries abstained.""

Ah, seems like shitholes something common southern states heavily criticized death tolls even approach happened Northeast Europe

That's misleading! look **death rate per 100,000 population**, many US states well European countries world. describe protect certain degree, blue medical masks far better terms safety. keeping distance, washing hands, sanitizing regularly suffice. please consider using blue one. Peace much love Canada üá®üá¶ Umm thanks don‚Äôt play football No. Difficult tell Trump's babbling, putting UV light inside body. finding specific version UVC light use public spaces sanitize air. There's chance heard something specifically created bunch BS result, again, hard tell Trump's babbling. X 7 months. CERB maximum 7 months, like US stimulus payment. CERB people loss income qualify, every single person like US $1200 payment. Well, you‚Äôre inviting right? bring light inside body... apparently compiled journalists, surprisingly. great taboo COVID journalism context. We're race stupidity. moment, stupidity ahead. ...Duh sarcastic sob. fact religious, haven‚Äôt church months online versions carry risk. also wear masks religiously about. 

And think protests didn‚Äôt pass virus need turn propaganda use brain.  Never said dumbass really. Completely different sentiment entirely different point.

Yes, I'm skeptical Pfizer results end-of-October. \~30,000 patients enrolled, current infection rates suggest ready then. suggest *could* be, companies always like put best possible news front (with caveat, like possibility). expect results November December unless see spikes Europe really begin climb here.

Pfizer optimistic here, inflammatory say optimism drives investment. 50% effective even mean? flu vaccine bizarre special case vaccines. pot shot every year months months advance many strains influenza mutate often rapidly guess wrong takes months grow fresh batch influenza vaccines. whole point stunt losses life prevent spending days week totally sick otherwise healthy. 14 day period determined virus. time record unemployment, government making sure everyone enough eat place live. Maybe even stimulate economy. can't even prevent people starving death global pandemic, what's point government? Who's debating that? arguing yourself. sounds like people great lives, blessed really great cheated. lives Mom Dad stolen virus many joke daily basis straight believe it‚Äôs hoax sort. took pandemic seriously still got sick, still told started this, would anger, love inspired So, let‚Äôs change parents weren‚Äôt blessing me, brother, sister, spouses, children. blessing every person met them. mom beautiful soul anyone could met. generous love everyone. didn‚Äôt love love you, something wrong I‚Äôm sure dad ever met stranger, could strike conversation anyone make smile. went years coaching youth sports loved helping children become better loved family much anything everything could possibly them. love family greatest came grandchildren, nine total. wanted best grandchildren, would go way make one feel special. pretty darn awesome miss much.

I‚Äôll never see smile see Liam Ava come room. won‚Äôt get see grandchildren grow up, see many grandchildren know lot people believe have/had loving, caring, affectionate, devoted parents, wrong. That‚Äôs parents. wish could fill Hold family close. Treat every moment like it‚Äôs last, could well be. Love keep wish everyone could see eyes. would see two loving caring couple, ever. Without them, world got bit gloomy. shouldn‚Äôt destruction millions livelihoods, plunging millions poverty globally making life miserable everyone used reasons lockdowns bad idea? ignore that? We‚Äôve lots viruses past 100 years none destroyed global economy. virus infects human, that‚Äôs it. I'm participate this, gather I'll checking course year.

ETA: Pfizer specifically*

2nd ETA: heck maybe two, that's cool look rhesus macaques results Phase I. Pretty similar. yes, good immune response. Oxford's Phase II also produced good levels antibodies T-cell response. Rushing towards herd immunity suppose feel like that's moment fever dream 2020 ends. cannot wait. Good luck still keep mind wear masks recover. Sorry that‚Äôs seriously weird bobble-head effect woman right. using 99% iso spray bottle effective using FDA approved disinfectant? precautions place make level safe required frivolous, optional operation. Spread occurs. find irresponsible create unnecessary contacts cause spread recreational purposes. Contacts exist safest way possible serve needs. one needs served restaurant. many contactless lower contact ways eat food, even food cases. Plus non unionized workers obligated accommodate kids bus there. Agree. Trump brought festering carbuncle surface. burst, ain't gonna pretty.  think stage 2 determine immediate safety results, tolerated dosage sufficient indication immune response, stage 3 determine promising dosage effective preventing mitigating disease larger population, continuing monitor safety. 

Stage 4 continued long term safety monitoring approval distribution population large. Doctors diagnose. Nurses pretty much everything else day day duties here, right. I‚Äôm confused this, death Alberta yesterday...? marry Canadian? born live US, boyfriend born Canada. I'd love move we're married process seems confusing. problem everything right, can't account others. Rapid tests still take minutes. going stand test everyone coming event concert whatever, bottleneck door waiting minutes person's result would unfeasible, unless afraid *instant* test, see happening. could tell people take test advance arriving, people think mask much ask now, would ones would either take lie, even get positive, still lie, flu preventing risk others far less important going good time.  president lost popular vote currently approval rating 40% (and [has never approval rating complicated, showed versed American politics. think bring confidence level match knowledge level. That's general life advice.

I know country live I'm 100% certain understand country's politics better do. Everyone except right Pursuing herd immu dangerous, country also world. death rate country increase significantly soon. lead human right disaster. maybe youngers wont feel pain. consider PCR tests, extremely sensitive, still noticeable false negative rates even _after_ onset symptoms...I find really difficult think get rapid tests accurate. science accomplished crazier things past. gist like pretty much disease nutritional deficiency make COVID19 hit harder.

Which seems like common sense widely denied though somehow COVID19 special can't apply know coronaviruses it. Health agencies encouraging people healthy much encouraging social distancing. Nah, that's 2021 plot twist, can't throw first season Something something stock dump, something something executive bonuses something something insider trading specifically talking everyone past critical need. consider ""over"" vaccine ubiquitous, so, flu vaccine, year. Lol. Companies admitted raising prices ‚Äúonly‚Äù 9.9% per quarter. didn‚Äôt agree actually lower prices. Let alone issue say. Nope, full shit.  referring point faults shithole? Well yeah. There's deadly pandemic ruining everyone's lives. know what, einstein? courage convictions, go outside, maskless free whole world see. naturally hope catch COVID, hope nobody does. 

But do, hunch come back sub tell us wrong are. Kinda hard type text ventilator, see definitely going biggest hurdle face.

The biggest hurdle getting people continue social distance vaccinated still low mid levels distribution. 

A vaccination license whatever want, guarantee people part 40%, spread virus. Ay dios mio

Also everyone knew doing, knew risks. already know brazen corruption going exactly know data, studies, reports botched, manipulated, delayed. assume dumpster fire start vaccinating significant portion population.

*Edit: kids K-5 Elementary. even upper grades gone well tell. data kids spread it? /s  Youre linking sources directly prove claims fully accurate. 

The first article January, back **there reason worry**. believe 1 single case time, nothing really happend **a month later**. proba ly find exact numbers dates look website, numerous others. 

Now could argue said *misleading*, *factually wrong*. 

Also quoted ""You cant infected Sweden"" nowhere said article linked. that's straight wrong.

Regarding ""peaks"", far know predictions, relatively spot on. peak way back April, links posted March claimed would soon see numbers start dropping. arguement weeks most. predictions based seeing, future, make educated guesses. 

Regarding herd immunity, clearly says video, way truly get rid Covid-19 herd immunity **either** people get infected getting well **or** vaccinating. would also like point ""a level immunity"" wildly different ""herd immunity"", also never claimed ""herd immunity"" part strategy. 

Regarding children immune, here's said article linked; consistently argued public well generally receiving extremely mild symptoms, children spread coronavirus great degree""*

That mean **immune** claimed said. 

Regarding personal opinions, couldnt care less. thing matters actions people, opinions might private. backlog labor day reporting. look 7 day average clearly see reporting artificially low labor day, causing artificial stiff drop. unreported backlogged deaths reported days following labor day instead, causing numbers artificially high. teach large high school people seem take virus seriously.

Until year, ""dream job"" situation 80%+ students(/students' parents) electing send back school (in over-capacity building \~8,000) concerned me. started remotely 3 weeks began back face-to-face 2 weeks ago.

Which options, other, might best keep safe sanitary? ideas school given might explore no/little expense myself? Months later, Reddit echo chamber emotionally committed idea proven virus airborne, downvote oblivion real science goes narrative, still absolutely open case. especially bad r/science, r/coronavirus, major news subreddits.

Good luck Florida. students campus, let alone broader community school in. I'm one researchers quoted article critiquing research design Sturgis paper.

There's research note version critique recent observational COVID-19 work forthcoming available here: posted working draft version Reddit actually got useful feedback made paper, thanks!

I thorough discussion Sturgis paper specifically I've regular review new COVID-19 papers find (20+ counting): feel free ask questions make suggestions future papers would good methods critique. Pretty obvious would be; people think take mask THEY'RE EATING reason they're invincible. get take now. Smart people concerned well treating it. largely control whether get infected. Unless happened live nursing home Democrat state early on. guys making stuff problem? know I‚Äôll called hard certainly won‚Äôt popular sub, schools near open little month issues. schools solid plan, parents acting responsible multi-step symptom checks morning, kids adapted better ever expected. often remind kids remove masks less social distancing get home - it‚Äôs completely normal (and became way quickly). It‚Äôs so
Impressive watch wash hands school - wow, really singing birthday song - school reinforced Day 1 never would done parents told too. kids, teachers, schools handled much better feel like would age. Rest assured, one single infection results thereafter devastating. really nervous sending back far it‚Äôs better could hoped. Maybe, nothing else, serves sliver hope someone else similar shoes.
*Edit: kids K-5 Elementary, nieces/nephews way High School keeping close tabs rumors course. far good isolated mostly non-school initiated Positives we‚Äôve heard of. district went back full capacity masks mandatory grades 4-12 students can‚Äôt 2m apart (which can‚Äôt) masks grade 4.

Just please misconception, let‚Äôs imagine affects 60. ICUs reach full capacity grandma others alike. Imagine badly hit head wall u internal bleeding. shall ambulance take you? gp? 

Also, think it‚Äôs nice elderly locked inside fear contract virus cos careless younger people driving numbers up? 


Keep fucking numbers low, even think safe ‚Äòlittle flu‚Äô! 

If Yes. response comment, article. 

Also, stress due Covid isn‚Äôt solely finances. There‚Äôs plenty others along it. What? None Fauci‚Äôs fault. expert giving perspective colder weather affect us. Direct anger towards White House, dude. see commercial now:


""Pandemic Airlines cause solution ...for Covid needs."" Link? I'm pretty sure happen.  happen spanish schools. money hire teachers kids mostly stuffed classrooms covid19 cant keep social distance so... matter time. 

We great. old normal. much bigger issue: emboldened Donald Trump he's elected. attack you.  ""liberals"" burning country.  state fact. predicted one learnt Damn thing. virus dropping US current behaviors. Throw another 50% resistance infection across percentage population, many cases left pretty quickly. They're right thing. 

30K cases last 3 days, 120 deaths.

Shutting country proven much damage people's livelihoods. Thankfully people starting voice skepticism towards unnecessarily harsh lockdown measures. Trump: ‚Äúat least unemployment rate down‚Äù I've seen many comments people saying ""once get vaccinated I'm done care more"". work way. Vaccinated people still need abide mask, distancing local lockdown rules. Don‚Äôt label, it‚Äôs horseshit cop outs people use write away people‚Äôs arguments don‚Äôt ability argue calmly comprehend someone thinks different

You alone info videos surfaced China Jan/Feb long gone see, people gall call ‚Äútheorist‚Äù paid attention late Wasn‚Äôt Battle Britain biggest aviation challenge ever? Going office feel like I'm taking crazy pills hahah. guys need go outside, things functioning last couple months live (very dense high population). bad compound fracture toe last week went ER, hospital empty. Asked doctor Covid problems chuckled said turn TV. many Theoretical Physicists required make astonishing discovery?  rule thumb ignore predictions two weeks out. Avoid topic political comments. y'all snarky? Obviously I'd wear mask Well made day. practically flu season south hemisphere due covid precautions (about 95% lesd compared normal levels planning narrow body only. excellent results clinical trials going full flaps low speed. u/stasi_a said, luckily Boeing ton spare 737 MAX available. Considering number patients extra fuel economy save bunch dough. People willing take risks like eating pandemic probably lots stupid things.

You'd think [the really support that:

Community exposure 14 days illness onset | Case-patients (Number, %) | Control group (Number, %) | Difference groups (%)
-------------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:
Restaurant | 63 (40.9) | 44 (27.7) | **13.2**
Bar/Coffee shop|13 (8.5)|8 (5.0)|**3.5**
Church/Religious gathering|12 (7.8)|8 (5.0)|**2.8**

Shopping|131 (85.6)|141 (88.1)|**-2.5**
Office setting|37 (24.0)|47 (29.6)|**-5.6**

Aside restaurant visits, Covid patients really engaged risky behaviours much control group. fact, control participants slightly likely visited salon previous 14 days, would expected marker risky behaviour.

Restaurant exposure statistically significant difference, partly study size small (154 Covid patients 160 control participants).

Differences self-reported mask use small statistically significant (p-value = 0.86):

Reported use cloth face covering mask 14 days illness onset| Case-patients (Number, %) | Control group (Number, %) | Difference groups (%)

I talking US-Americans still USA hope came days ago Germany.

If 30-50% population right thing (social distancing; wearing masks; desinfecting) risk factor need here. 

Fix political social climate wait vaccine need proof taken, irresponsible come take lightly possibly kill dozens people. wont safe visit Spain long time yet. Vaccine not. 

We indeed handling second wave, first one, poorly. 

Mainly politicians care votes money are, doubt it, third world country many aspects, pretend otherwise.

Dont come flight tickets hotels dirty cheap. trap. NYT source anything. I‚Äôm looking trial registration itself: http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89951424 

I think would interesting watch, shows facts, amount new cases main media solely showing. Pretty sure every NFL player knows risks playing incredibly dangerous sport end careers early leave dementia later life. Covid another risk they're willing take earn bag dropped ball like bowl soup infomercial fucking way???? know, studies referring don‚Äôt exist, can‚Äôt exist, would evidence (in)effectiveness inoculation draw conclusions. studies could exist point time, wouldn‚Äôt still clinical trials vaccines. scenarios vaccines don‚Äôt lead herd immunity (lack initial effectiveness, lack lasting immunity, lack uptake, mutation, vaccine induced enhancement) absence actual vaccines, evidence them. guy obviously old, may already eaten parents. Human safety probably big concern it‚Äôs supposed given everyone. Millions asians live Brazil, especially japanese descendants.

""Brazil home largest Japanese population outside Japan.""

Source:  could mostly back normal Fall 2020 good job handling first wave. didn't, things back normal.

If dig bit comments scientists, what's often reported ""Scientist says X"" actually ""If A, B, C happen, may may happen, X probably happen"". ""complained"". wondering different would pretended worried. Well, said ""I really wish call that."" Sadly, whole thing way powered. made okay start (\~2k participants), pull weak. result, cuts small make meaningful conclusions. Paired aggressive controlling, really good restaurant point. wish asked indoor/outdoor restaurants, I'd love see difference.

The rest enough data make meaningful conclusions.

The bar/coffee shop question problematic. Uncontrolled numbers 13 8 (sick, sick). Apparently 5x many people ate restaurants (107) went starbucks, seems ludicrous. guessing including bar scared people giving honest response expect coffee shop mix meant reverse, make people comfortable drive honesty, came backwards. Add P-hack 21 bar/coffee shop patrons come something significant shame.

The public transport encouraging finding, least look see 18 people rode study, split sick control pretty even (8 10, respectively).

We really need study x50, could get good stuff. Still, great went tried. You‚Äôre allowed compare 1918. South Dakota chance... think certain amount Asians probably died corona early January time thought pneumonia wear mask tin foil hat? Sounds like young people getting infected spreading around nowadays. Yea speak bs. faith *local infected numbers* public given skewed, due live. know naive always pictured getting vaccinated finally going movies again. God miss movies tourist. 

She travelled member EU state returning Germany partying leading this. 

This post title worded illicit certain response clearly based Comment thread Anti-Americanism. again, acceptable fine. wanted point out. 30k people going die 3 days. We've already U.S. take month see deaths go drastically. Especially majority cases younger age groups. means take another period spread older people. I'm hoping mask-when-sick habit sticks around. great cutting flu southern hemisphere year. Florida man again! sitting indoors eating groups? seems school cafeterias break rooms jobs looked well. moving average deaths currently 700s. almost 3,000 April despite fewer cases compared now.  mixture legit stupidity people acting stupid justified 'when stupid Rome...' thinking. media politics today people playing dumb public wants, public playing dumb they're looking role models media politics direction. course there's legitimately dumb whose way thinking never validated/glorified. dumb never felt gifted b/c nobody says dumb things confidence. Thanks! guess remember never trust fact checking BZ... said SOOOO offensive? truth?? fuckin psychopath  mid first trimester pregnancy started work home. Instead waking 5:45am 7:45am (now 6:45am prenatal yoga). Honestly able get extra sleep helped much, using lunch naptime. know would managed otherwise... study defined either one, two, three symptoms believe three months discharge Italy. Roughly 60% least one ongoing symptom like shortness breath, joint pain, loss smell, chest pain, etc. hospital probably disproportionately sick general looks like 87% considered ""long haulers"", really look much watched hour long video physician covering months ago. 60 days first symptom onset.

Personally consider anything past 60 90 days abnormal experience respiratory virus. Normally pandemic going average person would little freaked three four weeks. People read couple articles Huffington post count scientific evidence. yell people need listen scientists! I'm alright. Thanks kind words. paying bills. socializing greater [1/efficacy] times currently actually increases risk creating.

Now, granted still less 35% pre-COVID socialization part, problem people drop level. Problem solved, guess. 

It‚Äôs also getting colder climate change must solved, too! Resident too. look familiar all. Chances surviving month November ... 0%. thoughts makes students shitty? think fundamental problem home life parental support, education system simply discards students instead help them. Wow, riveting information. Yeah, like FedEx 18,000 planes, 4 airlines 10k planes, capable amazon.

If think company 82 planes logistical prowess company 18,000 cargo planes I'm glad making important decisions. title says, quotes, need 8,000 around 100 times Amazon owns, know, biggie. Sorry burst bubble won‚Äôt made widely available first. It‚Äôll targeted towards elderly commodities (unless that‚Äôs you). That‚Äôs say shouldn‚Äôt celebrate they‚Äôre vaccinated though - still start normality us observer blinded. explained: ‚ÄúThe genome sequence like human fingerprint.
‚ÄúBased identify things.
‚ÄúI [use this] evidence tell people come lab China, ones made it.
‚ÄúAnyone, even biology knowledge, able read it, check identify verify yourself.‚Äù

Sure... Sounds legit Ah misunderstood first instance. Truth soooooo inconvenient. Colleges person. criminal National security risk point. change fact still spreading lol far, not. look users post history, nothing posts like this. study ever claimed isnt agreed upon definition constitutes long hauler. actually long walks beach! :)

Nope. totally agree. regime go. don‚Äôt want told know dear leader doesn‚Äôt best interests mind.

Can bring Yang back mix? say UK former colonies US India? confused unless trump steals election late 2024 explain name lmao incorrect? remember sub China sent bunch allies free tests. virus must responsible that. Well, really. See, know McDonald's coffee burn well-publicized lawsuit, already well-documented. COVID like Starbucks Peet's coffee, scientifically proven able burn you. coffee McDonald's, hold assuming data.

Making assumptions makes ass me. I‚Äôm March 21; either vaccine announced it‚Äôs matter distribution say fuck it. virus gets one year life. ""Thus staying within current regulatory dose limits, low-dose-rate far-UVC exposure potentially safely provide major reduction ambient level airborne coronaviruses occupied public locations."" 

One situations like other! One situations outside body!

Seriously, adult Sesame Street teach basic critical thinking older people really needs thing. Adjuvenated vaccines would probably provide year protection 6 months probably worst-case scenario live Texas?  place called China? COVID going anywhere, immunity guaranteed, even vaccine. think one study found ~~60%~~ 87% went hospital 60 days first onset symptoms. Take will.

&amp;#x200B;

 190 6 month; 30k 2 months reduced rate folks aren‚Äôt going see problem numbers speak themselves, come last weeks. someone outside, still stupid.

Voter turnout higher swing states rest country though. Another surge excess mortality incoming then. would have. much messaging get us want us instead educating us facts are. propaganda. Virus started us.

^ *Chinese propaganda detected.* indeed handling second wave, first one, poorly. 

Except nobody really dying anymore. absolutely disgusting nice you. into, ""long walks beach""? XD

but know what, right, want feckless, pathetic excuse govt deciding. I'll leave good guys &amp; gals we're voting come November I've ridden anti-American band wagon time two myself, nice view people lots countries done this.  Exactly, wish people media would care number. People want see number fits whatever opinion already have. What's ""random spike?"" makes ""random?"" There's 20% positivity rate. matter ""it's colleges?"" 20% positivity rate ridiculously bad circumstances, effort go toward taking seriously instead rationalizing way diminish it. Shame much convoluting circulating. still believe man trying uphold reasonability us, American-people Don‚Äôt worry, wackjobs already spreading distrust Facebook Don‚Äôt worry, wackjobs already spreading distrust Facebook  really shame. beautiful place fall kind thing. go bankrupt able get deposit?? Except nobody really dying anymore.  Conservatives often can't understand satire:

[The Irony Satire: Political Ideology Motivation See Want See Colbert 

Probably lack sense humor:

[Conservatives lack sense humor, study finds] 

An inability understand satire sarcasm also indicative brain damage brain disease:

[The Science Sarcasm? Yeah, Consistent, honest messaging federal level would've benefited us significantly. imagine scenarios coming up. Thanksgiving first Black Friday. crowds always large. people indoors November. Holidays Summer like Memorial Day, 4th July, Labor Day could spent outdoors socially isolated, Thanksgiving big family get together most. School also active states. live Wisconsin many area schools person classes seeing quarentines they've class two weeks. Also, believe Florida, Arizona, Texas plan opening back states follow numbers going down. live Wisconsin case numbers week getting really bad already. sure going continue, 7 day avg positive well 10% right cases climbing rapidly. 

We also see indoor dining vs outdoor dining. large parties weddings. There's lot weddings planned fall canceled spring occuring. 

The numbers going many states simply testing less. means people relax virus sneak us again. 

Even this, see 400k deaths Dec 31st. Though scanrios described worry me. prediction match reality complete trash. Sorry know pessimists love shit, c'mon really?

Well pessimists making dire predictions ones going apoplectic idea ""rushing"" vaccine political reasons.

For Pete's fucking sake, honestly believe 2,000 people day going die virus end year, possibly rolling vaccine almost certainly safe soon possible? Maybe thinking Berlin Airlift? logistical They‚Äôll anything steal election. Even kill. Twenty one pilots

rawr XD There's citizenship, cultural beliefs practices, ancestry/lineage. I'd say card calls Swedish, mean culturally ancestrally Swedish. No... UV light used years kill viruses. used ICUs. light mentioned, already existed. said "" bringing light body"" made fun for. Except nobody really dying anymore.  One patients adverse reaction figure weather related vaccine not. pause trial UK investigate socializing totally risk free. even masks.

Maybe never make contact people, won‚Äôt communicable diseases. would nice right? Osterholm railing article spreading confusion evidence. disappointed fellow countrymen. think worst past U.S lol woman‚Äôs diagnosis confirmed yet, improving likely discharged hospital early Wednesday, Soriot said. mild never saw commented acknowledged, whenever put R number, also need period.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, R 1.2 UK now, date time period talking about? day? maybe it‚Äôs like false sense security. wear mask know may protect getting virus talking seriously. prime minister talked yesterday say shit say squat they'd do. Basically ""yup, we're screwed, bad he"", said worst they'll partially lock touched regions/cities meant closing restaurant early banning gathering 10 people. 

People want care. Schools reopened, kids age 11 wear masks, there's that. People party like there's tomorrow, go bars restaurants social distancing joke, try best still, I'm talking client come super close mask hear well, bla bla bla. 

Mask wore nose cases, cleaning hands seems like torture. live like before. Government fucked summer we're paying price now.

Also there's lot tests done asymptomatic people detected there's that. Sorry Harris actually popular. confusing someone‚Äôs first choice president popularity. sound like really bought Bernie propaganda. M$M? clearly isn‚Äôt serious discussion. Everyone already knew UV light disinfect. Well, except certain someone thought thing learned common knowledge proceeded make stuff up. ""The researchers estimate continuous exposure far-UVC light current regulatory limit would kill 90% airborne viruses 8‚Äâminutes, 95% 11‚Äâminutes, 99% 16‚Äâminutes, 99.9% 25‚Äâminutes."" mean many countries, no, SA, ME, India put ""first world""

How farther NY? AU, Germany, NZ, CA? 


How Taiwan areas virus contained get hospitalizations deaths minimum. places see spikes rationally react appropriately instead like ""oh well fuck nothing gonna try attempt levity part I‚Äôm lazy put anymore thought it. I‚Äôll go ahead downvote sir incivility disallowed comment incivil, far bigger fish fry elsewhere sub. Keeping Sixth Army supplied airdrop encircled Red Army Stalingrad one massive aviation challenge (which Nazis failed, miserably). intend disrespect criticism I'm going say, rather different perspective may worth something you, maybe not.

There seems research shows marital success inversely correlated much spend wedding (including rings, etc).  

My wife got married courthouse, like 5 family members present.  awesome.  dress up, make big production it.  never even bought rings (we remain ring-less!).  mom, mom, brother, brother's wife, kid.  went nice lunch (10 dollar plate kind situation) that.

In words, WANTED simplify handle wedding, shame it, research seems suggest could good.  added benefit that, addition losing stress big production wedding, also would lose stress particularly dangerous wedding.

It's super personal thing, again, intend judgment criticism.  Whatever folks end doing, wish best!  Getting married stressful, laid groundwork (compatible world views, good communication skills, willingness work problems together, trust, etc), one best things life.

Edit: Yikes, gettin downvotes here.  really intend say one could conceivably get multiple birds stoned time: cheaper, less stressful wedding (yay?), statistically correlates successful marriage (yay?), simultaneously safer terms covid, fewer people/festivities (yay?).  

Again, let point criticized one!  lot pressure society things certain way, sometimes ways best interests.  good point alternatives.  intend pressure anyone, point alternatives!  Again, wish person best matter whether take suggestions - sincerely.  Sorry offending anyone. don't. Also comment then. Sheesh, nobody likes canada jokes anymore worth, I'm glad rest world opposes bully.

Really? rest world still following US sanctions countries like Cuba Iran. opposing US? 

Real opposition bully mean ignoring US sanctions. happening? Bingo. least Northeast, frustration general ""over it"" attitude palpable. Mask compliance still pretty high generally, even waning slightly.

Pandemics social/societal ending far medical/scientific ending. tell people go school, gather friends families, cover faces times public say hell it. totally normal reasonable response, frankly, I'm sick COVID elitists media portraying selfish behavior. Yeah people assholes rest us children end lives risk. yeah guess old selfish people always get free pass individualist selfish. 
I get it. Assault usually is.

But assaulting first responder separate thing? Like assaulting police officer. music 97 really touches soul. considered plane make one trip? Study warns. Upvoted you, know got upvoted saying thing lol  battle britain trying get 16 billion doses people around world. No, conspiracy simply conspiracy. closed-door agreement individuals power band together interest another group individuals, usually personal gain sort pay off. conspiracy theories wrong. 


The difference valid conspiracies random, 'dumb' conspiracy theorists is; Journalists people actually necessary logical structure 'investigate' things back claims facts evidence circumstancial, open interpretation, without smallest amount doubt reveal said conspiracies public.  


The logical person going trust anonymous post dubious internet site that's actually known trolling riling idiots opinion piece reference evidence whatsoever except blatant 'opinions'. 


The 'logical' person also going say something stupid like 'The Covid virus man made'. without actual evidence claim. either researcher investigate inspecting virus, listen said 'experts' knowing intellectual depth fully comprehend would unveil virus 'man made'.  


Instead, average conspiracy theorist reason convinced 'logical abilities' instead humble, believes 'instinct' superior specialists sacrifice 20+ years life even fully comprehend narrow, specific field research. Instead, unable let go arrogance (because feels good imagine privy big secrets virtue superior 'instinct), default believing everything opposing position automatically 'in' conspiracy 'lesser' intellect, aka (Brainwashed sheep / NPC's). 


So short, difference someone logically assesses possibility conspiracy, dumbass conspiracy theorist depth, emotionally charged, fact empty response made interested painting empty strawman argument filled wild accusations someone thinks position based one single line text.  Nobody gun? Maybe due amount Asians medical field? Nurses doctors exposed? them, I'd claim synthetic control matches mobility, testing, covid rates, etc. Sturgis difference trend among went compared.

If I'm (or you) I'd argue proper epidemiological model fundamentally measuring modeling infections- they're modeling thing (infections+testing) care understand all. proper epidemiological model would get us real guess true number infections, could use back rate transmission (R_t), could model function mobility (like suggest). something completely ought happen, also like step 90 list things needed happen even get point.  least worry overpopulation anymore /s Damn. means knew u.s. overrun absolute morons would screw response. Ill take ty decreases likelihood entering relationship 2021 exactly 0%. never see daylight again. Zero reason hideous act. First all, admission rate refer individual likelihood admitted. measure percentage people general require admitted get covid. title says vitamin supplements decrease covid ICU admission rate, means lower general statistical percentage. individual definitely lower chance admitted. Chances would, that's means. misleading, words mean assuming mean.

Second, read article? Nowhere state saying. last study authors said statement, ""Our pilot study demonstrated administration high dose Calcifediol 25-hydroxyvitamin D, main metabolite vitamin endocrine system, significantly reduced need ICU treatment patients requiring hospitalization due proven Covid-19.‚Äù

This study specifically looked people admitted hospital covid rate group people transferred ICU given high doses vitamin D. anything, title misleading mean Vitamin supplements general reduce admission rate, high doses vitamin supplements given already sick hospital reduce admission rate people ICU.

Also, unless kidney problems something, daily vitamin-d supplement (typically 1000 IUs) going cause vitamin toxicity anyone. find online, take least 40,000 IUs day least month, vitamin toxicity potentially issue. numbers lower bound found. Harris new blood, bought paid corporate neo-liberal likes saw Americans turn orange TV show host help Biden delivered absolutely nothing same. Orlando, Florida think safe say unfortunately true. That's official *the possibility* exist. Go vote! Vote.gov I'm truly sorry. hope gets better. pretty accurate assessment given curve.  November can't come soon enough. trash headline.

""Twice likely eaten restaurants"".

In report

4 times likely personal contact infected person. 

So going restaurants big problem. forget people listen, say go restrictions even though still restrictions Thanks including Poland!  Yeah, would want capable logistics company ever exist charge? shove ass, clap on, clap cure virus! Brilliant! Depending basically cities virus circulating high rate, mask obligatory streets, shops every indoor place, supposedly obligatory work space every child age 9 11 school. 

Now, wear mask moving inside restaurant tables bar take eat drink (yea practical) social distances there.

There's also people ""wear"" mask nose logic apparently thing. many people normally die day, matter course?  let LeBron get helicopters. think it‚Äôs correlation rather causation. Asians tend live large metro areas, tend affected covid. Covidddd time wanna dumbest thing I've ever read. Biden ""can win."" Hardly resounding endorsement election slam dunk Dems. 

P.S. nobody likes Biden all, enthusiasm rating 20% among likely Biden voters, historically low. Dude wrote: right. area seem fucked up. many areas like US?

He admitted problem asked reasonable (and important) question frequency problem. 

Instead addressing question (either answering *or* explaining problematic/irrelevant/etc), seem gotten upset - judging comment communicate nothing except upset. 

Why question upset you? consider unreasonable it? 

Do think useful discuss data many hospitals overwhelmed, why, long? Personally, consider extremely useful information important making sound decisions - I‚Äôd like understand objection. naturally hope don‚Äôt catch COVID, hope nobody does. 

Not person writing to, appreciate this. gets little sickening read comment comment people wishing others ill (or even dead) days.  society dystopian, evenly distributed think true three four months ago.  haven‚Äôt eaten girl friend bus good. far wants outsider stupid - 15 election would matter hugely.

I maybe get don'y bother vote California North Dakota outcome give, get vote swing state. Unfortunately gene pool hasn‚Äôt improved attendees already past procreation years. great first major candidate drop despite M$M Clinton &amp; Obama machines behind her, winning exactly zero delegates. could cost Dems presidency. People want president Harris based Joe's condition that's Dem vote arguably for. People want truth. want easy lies And? another data dump. occurred 2 months ago... [Do smell burnt 90s really peak earth sure... guess crowded housing. next level research needed. pretend German.  seen Republicans rejoice way rejoiced Harris selected since election night 2016. He's making somewhat convincing argument... live dystopian society. hope we're dystopian society whole. *Are we?...* ""refundable"" even funnier then. Someone goes ""I'm cheering whichever vaccine works"", real world context 3-4 promising candidates production deals lined already begun manufacturing risk

**There 200 vaccine candidates worked on.** production deals lined up. ""real world context"" grossly simplified view reflect reality. indeed working vaccine available mass use works can't produced widely."" wider thread Oxford vaccine too, manufactured risk.

I comprehend absolutely insist must hate Oxford vaccine. prove wrong exactly? genuinely stubborn correct people views fairly sure guy wrote meant 'whichever one works available enough might get take it"",

Yes, say that. Therefore clarified that. Becouse comment. apparently monster hate every development goes towards making vaccine. Everything black white hispanic population become largest ethnic group Texas? know projected happen year without reliable census data hard track. large difference cases coming majority ethnic group cases coming 9% population. Yeah interesting holidays always turn dip cases/deaths get made next week.

Young people anywhere, college college. Same. Concussion first padded practice sophomore year. Also first day school. god damned long snapper. singular concussion fucked up. can‚Äôt imagine multiple. Sheesh. Lol what? It‚Äôs pretty weird Asians much affected covid whites. Asians better socioeconomically, can‚Äôt explanation. Maybe it‚Äôs areas covid deaths, like New York New Jersey Asians? 0.6% case fatality rate seems pretty close expected IFR covid-19. What's happening lot people tested now. Whereas back first wave testing limited, thus infections never recorded cases (only severe ones tested, thus higher fatality rate back then) There's lot people hobbies.

Lungs Magical organs regenerate like lizard tails.  bothered study's method explore group people go Sturgis, 99.86% us, done lower transmission rates ~30 day study period. believe 260,000 cases linked Sturgis 1.4M cases period leaves 1.04M cases us go rally. end study assigns 20% national cases Sturgis attendees (0.14% population) 80% remainder population. reasoning large transmission among Sturgis crowd given lack social distancing face mask evidenced cell phone pings local video. OK. study account significantly lower transmission rates people go Sturgis? cell phone pings show greater social distancing? know, studied.

Percentage wise, biggest underestimates deaths first-world countries major outbreaks UK, Spain, Netherlands (all around 50 %) Italy (around 30 %). compares 100 % underestimate Mexico, Peru Bolivia, 200 % Ecuador, South Africa Indonesia. badly affected poorer countries (India, Iraq, Colombia, Pakistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Philippines, Panama, Guatemala...) data excess deaths seems unavailable. Wow. saw news trial resumed again. guess panicked reaction unfounded. Aren‚Äôt cases imported travelers returned infected infected entered? people voted 2016. cool anti-maskers hate Halloween!


""Masks trap carbon dioxide kill you!""


""If touch mask DiE!""


""Masks block oxygen getting in!"" Point being??? lot less visible public. world eyes companies something easily digestible ""they put fake vaccine.""

Also lot got shamed pulling prices, see happened remdesivir - Gilead give orphan drug status, etc. Nothing. They're pulling hindsight ""predictions"" know where. definitely issues distribution long health care workers old people get shots, still good shape next year. Yep, best keep personal political views patient interactions. Many times find biting tongue staying focused they're see even though want say much them. fact guy keeps posting ""solution"" thread leads believe no, unfortunately, not. Nobody upset college students right thing. ones party selfish fucks need arrested. guys really know calculate risk. eastern seaboard do....NYC, Philly, Boston, DC, VA. one realistically expects lockdowns eradicate virus.

You clearly know nothing politics Victoria, Australia NZ. They're aiming complete elimination virus policy locking time virus resurfaces.

Victoria already virus control (in layman's terms) still lockdown they're aiming 0 cases. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! People become complacent. It‚Äôs human nature. Gotta love typical overreaction. Throw jail? what, spreading disease big deal 95% people get it? please get rid adotmatrix AlienApricot mods sub? multiple cases selectively removing left wing talking points leaving right wing talking points intact. agree point kind poorly stated. certainly kind risk assessment adverse vaccine effects vs. benefits vaccine, trials do. doesnt seem unreasonable might accept relatively higher level risk vaccine typical one, given scope problem. fear super spreader inadvertently killing someone keeps vigilant precautions great science recommends.

This allows live life forms normalcy less fear.

I hope history looks individuals day. non mask wearers, idiots refuse social distance all.....damn sociopaths.  Well work medicine go patients homes insurance companies. 80% ppl know mask is. Forget personal space respect parade 10 ppl place hood. assess lady chemo. 6 year old boy cannot control behavior. hazmat mask around people things going bad. ""He's home schooled"". tried leave bc bye im out. Random girls freshly washed hair darting out. stuck out. 7 women vanish 45min. 1 jerk dude behind jeep engine running standard decontamination procedure. jerk heaven forbid waits 1 minute. stopped cleaning put gas mask walked F door . cough him. shoot public let go petite lady exposed whore house news. mean Pharam companies hike prices 1000% , lobbies safer alternatives like marijuana qualms getting good chunk world hooked heroin-lite? like lot 18 year olds life experience telling us they've figured out. Reddit, combine neckbeard social life sees perpetual lockdown isolation says ""For me, Tuesday."" Treatments improved doctors learned worked work.  also protecting elderly better average age infected people lower. Finally, true number cases March April likely magnitudes reported case counts due testing availability ratio cases deaths looks off. vaccine company wants sell untested vaccine, that's fine me, long warn everybody properly make sign waivers such. end, serve scientific knowledge test whether works not. want guinea pig myself. 

I guess could say unethical since 99% laymen clear concept virus even works, that's true complex scientific concepts medical processes. Dude, that's terrifying, would stay far away. never forgive lost kid COVID.  didn‚Äôt mention USA once. Yall separate issue

The case death ratio far greater march-April. I‚Äôm asking possible explanations this? hostile. need insults, tone down. Ah yes. We‚Äôve completely ass fucked country w COVID. Time go fuck others. Oh lord, another cry river freedumbs piece. Agreed. thought people fundamentally good this, I'm convinced percentage anymore. Throughout whole thing, I've horrified complete lack ability care anyone, *including* family members. Like, I'm starting joke lizard-people conspiracy theory real all, based much person-masks slipping. Cool shipping thousands tons coal China right dying Great Barrier Reef. Fucking hates lockdown put place save people. Cool stuff, fuckhead. yeah call Fotze

edit: bl√∂de Fotze US, thats federal administration screwed testing pretended contained offshore month beginning, allowed spread silently vulnerable populations, increasing early mortality rates. adverse effect study must found vaccine, low enough risk benefits outweighed (either incidence severity). Given didnt unvaccinate people already study, hopefully doesnt push back time table. I'm numb virus. know I'm starting numb to? People's stupidity, uncaring lack compassion toward others, willful ignorance spreading misinformation.  


But maybe that's me. dupe anyway. Wait thought pick sides listen anything side say, reasonable don‚Äôt let monkeys steal vaccine time. four kids, chose virtual program school.   complete joke, causes nothing stress yelling chaos. two kids know read, kindergarten first grade 1-year-old. also older child also virtual School.

The kindergartner first reader meet 20 minutes morning whole class. first grader nothing academic time, teacher asks one question day kid gets respond, done.

She gets two live 15 minute sessions 100% academics. 5 weeks two 15 minute math lessons. 

She write three sentences journal day gets one assignment Monday Thursdays, none Fridays.

She's quite literally learning read. sight words phonics blends worksheets books read. public school Florida.

I could care less teaching kids home, find absolutely ridiculous nobody put together kind program state, nation, etc..anywhere kids. can't read nobody teaching read. 

I one-year-old second turn head trying climb onto oven turn buttons on. naps maybe one hour day, impossible kids academics.

So everyone think school daycare, use day care whatsoever use education kids. care getting education from, needs somewhere.

I know great teachers put together amazing lessons kids TV. many resources none utilized. 

There's also nobody bring issues with. wrote principal email said daughter's regressing reading do, literally responded email saying go another school. followed said concerns, 30 minutes live academics enough entire day. can't read main way talk teacher text, can't even text teacher can't write. principal followed second email said see first email, please let know would like withdraw her.

So I'm getting really frustrating hearing people say, easy virtual programs we're using schools daycares. I'm using school all, child getting education. So, want us schools anybody put something good together kindergartner first grader. they're quite literally consequences educating children virtual program. pushing things, there's oversight. eat at/take restaurant food one week so. supports community. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm love restaurant food was. prefer cook now. 

These scare reports studies really consider damage already hurting economic sector. need learn live virus. *Here see troll becoming desperate, attempts feed refuse vain making last desperate attempts al least salvage sense self worth.*  
  
*Not surprising anyone, fails miserably, smart troll. Undoubtedly persist puff little snood defeat word understands.*. 
  
*Now let's watch throw little hissy fit, comes.* take lots precautions too, going work essentials wearing mask social distancing. Cooking food hour it‚Äôs already cooked seems kill. mean you, worried maybe cook food. Let guess...you're Cpt Binky White House (aka Donald Trump) spewing bullshit always do, except well...you've already turned ally enemy long this, lied like american, fucked everyone, broken multiple treaties, reneged agreements, course...in true yankee fashion...blamed all.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is...not one person outside borders actually believes anything yanks say regarding others/other nations. shown true colours, frankly dog shit something scraped boots.

&amp;#x200B;

The next POTUS 'may' take time/effort rebuild bridge fools burnt...if 'we' allow it. Dishonest unstable 'partners' dont want business with, do...you keep dog damn short leash. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre already Yeah trust them. never take covid vaccine. No, bunch Redditors still live parents idea much stuff costs. WORLD GOING PLACE MOMENT, BABOONS!?!?!?! vague memories random day decided grocery shopping late feb early march. People everywhere, multiple carts loaded brim. grab random stuff ended leaving whole shopping cart full goods! around 7am too! Yeah excuse us pessimistic several 9/11‚Äôs worth deaths every week. mean can‚Äôt optimistic it‚Äôs 1,000 people needlessly dying day 7 months this. What? No. Parts Oregon Washington state north southern tip Canada, Northern California? No. know right. Italians also held accountable Roman Empire. we're it, let's round German citizens atrocities committed 70 years ago! Brazil lock either, I'm sure compliance mask wearing there.

Also comparison, Finland, Denmark Norway, border Sweden unlike locked down, death rate respectively 6.1, 10.9, 4.9 per 100k. either bad faith utter ignorance. Replacement lung tissue scar tissue permanent. basic medical fact. 1/10th serious debated reasonable grounds. right. isn‚Äôt relevant sub. relevant finding much death find acceptable.

This discussion isn‚Äôt masks either. wear mask. aren‚Äôt discussing anti-masker.

And yes, motorcycles rarely kill people rider. Although riders sometimes kill pedestrians.

So take would support measures get traffic deaths close zero? find level death acceptable time being? Would unfair say?  I'm cheering whichever one works! really. 

That hydroxychloroquine zinc. people still pushing Get good news outa lul Duh. shouldn‚Äôt surprise. He‚Äôs referring old normal, gradually move towards described. People saying can‚Äôt take another year equating see state old normal that‚Äôs accurate. Things open, things close places fuck up, gradually get there. started buying extra canned food basic things need back January February. told everyone gets here, things going change lot next year. March believed might July, 2021 things even started look normal. still believe people shell shocked could take another 9 months people unscramble heads anybody know flags they‚Äôre waving? Take one argument points use reason; use points say one point longer matters. 

We global pandemic dude. government helping people out. People coming together (figuratively, literal) instead anger directed towards kin. Poor people access social resources; unexpectedly hit pandemic also access resources. 

It's like potential issues become ""token black kid"". I've mental health issues grew thankful access additional food school provided. numerous ways socialize safely exercise help mental health. Undiagnosed cancer -here assume making argument unprecedented lockdown means people unable schedule doctor's appointments- could potentially could go up. sucks compassionate person would want that. However, death numerous illnesses due covid-19 go people practice simple routines. There's lockdown Auckland people supposed meet groups larger 10 sake possible contact tracing. mean isn‚Äôt true. People France Spain right they‚Äôre verge another lockdown. South Korea barely able avoid full blown one well. Oh yeah ""deeeeep dives"" supermarket's policy selling expired meat voter disenfranchisement 1% destruction country would rather see vaccine made release public without testing it? department Shit Sherlock. know anybody confusing dumb motherfuckers partying majority college students right thing. one shit moments. many months, understood healthcare community.

That‚Äôs risk Covid-19 kids better understood. That‚Äôs relevant comparison. likely vaccine life normal end next year. 900 times deaths per capita, would next impossible countries like Vietnam get bad. mention life returned normal. Sweden should‚Äôve reacted earlier unfortunately didn‚Äôt. Hey Florida, go ahead knock out.  New cases peaked middle July it‚Äôs month death rates didn‚Äôt go anywhere near numbers saw beginning. MS thing might actually condition already present vaccination somehow symptoms worsened vaccination might related. 

Transverse myelitis much bigger threat vaccine. upcoming candidates doesn‚Äôt seem likely hit market without extra observation. would installing extra insulation walls performing interior work convert space garden anything people homes? know, people likely need help most? ""No, stopping testing makes *seem* go away like miracle.""

FTFY 


Who knew Corona virus could dealt manner ravenous bugblatter beast Traal? country loosing moral Pretty sure cop fires gun duty mandatory time many evaluations. Complete ignorance. China country tests asymptomatic people. American drives around seeing nothing Trump signs, flags, bumper stickers... assume same.


Trump idiot here. Hum. Remember Obama? came terrible time, brought us semi-normalcy, got re-elected. idiots hate ""Blacks"" voted bigot, look got. referring wearing masks, staying home lol yeah welded side doors track everyone coming building, could used lock.

Melbourn Australia sent armed military guard exits instead, much cost effective /s sounds like way Microsoft Windows releases. Give let users find issues. Hope vaccine like Windows 10 like Windows 3.0. Australia, except prime minister Jack all, states leaders realized needed something worked consistent approach. White people shit. always find funny someone comments Hillary stage game. 

Hillary hasn‚Äôt POWER YEARS. 

You‚Äôre touch. Iowa, fucking mess pandering mentally unstable president sacrifice many american lives takes look presidential again. GOP give shit kids families.  status quo remain new toddler steps fuck shit?

You Americans laughable point. Good luck Wow. live make believe world. (Also, haven‚Äôt thought Hillary 4 years, seem think made insult?) 100% DV vegan recipes around 50¬¢ meal. take 1000mcg B12 week, since can't get plants.

This guy lots videos easy cheap vegan meal man... quarantine around Feb 15... Fuck that. soon get vaccine efficacy, I'll give months maybe others get it. enough do, fuck them. I'm going back normal. Hey code too! see FOX news source raise statistics:

Number deaths per confirmed cases:

* USA = 3%
* Italy = 12.6%
* UK = 11.6%
* Mexico = 10.7%
* Belgium = 10.9%
* Spain = 5.4%
* Sweden = 6.8%

So, suggesting 3% even lower? USA practically cure official now, like not. video made uncomfortable. kid standing way close positive holy fuck Oh man. vindictive petty side wishes way give NYCDOHMH someone information issued fine. Whatever. I'm human. remember seeing notes passengers refusing comply extremely rude belligerent towards folks airports supposed collect forms, even getting peace officer's face too, can't stand sort behavior. People can't even civil? want text reminders quarantine get tested start develop symptoms, gotta like that? They're humans too. 


The realistic rational side says let go, want listen comply. focus taking care yourself. *can,* choose to. Also like states could come together work they'd like team. Like unification sorts. Unification States America. TUSA. TUSA. he‚Äôs saying get infected Herd immunity isn‚Äôt binary thing. Every new immune person community helps slow spread bit more. Feel free go school become teacher get sweet extras claim have. won‚Äôt, loser. saying qualified, announce set hype ""the next vp women"" seems exclude another half people

And want use whataboutism, condemned Sarah back McCain's run anyways. bigot ignorant campaign.

Sure qualified current sitting president, high bar overcome means, celebrating big deal is.

The states NEED reform rebuilding electoral system basic system governance. mess allowing Biden surely better trump, able change reform things another trump extremist can't get office? longer call authoritarian. believe word liar! anyone believes kids cannot get virus sell ocean front property Arizona. say people wrong without cunt. think attacking people get consider say? won‚Äôt. Talking like internet trash. they? tried that‚Äôs demonstrated 0 power? Brace yourselves! seem actually believe people magically stop afraid getting sick losing health, risking bringing home ones love. People aren‚Äôt insane. us people depend us. They‚Äôll keep taking virus seriously threat passes. both, both. affording it? DENNIS: told you. We're anarcho-syndicalist commune. take turns act sort executive officer week.

ARTHUR: Yes.

DENNIS: decisions officer ratified special biweekly meeting.

ARTHUR: Yes, see.

DENNIS: simple majority case purely internal affairs,-- Money enough. Messaging important. Coordination important. Infrastructure important. know unpopular, people N95 mask wearing protect others. protect wearer. They‚Äôre 1000 deaths day India. Proportionally, states worse. *citation needed* business owner extremely upset response. absolute BS economy.

Editing add: needed shut 2 weeks truly flatten curve. 

I‚Äôm pissed opened 2 weeks early it‚Äôs going cause YEARS difficulties business. Well, unless want instruction French, may heard it. what's hundred thousand deaths compared awesome summer pool party? I'm working going school full-time 2 year college, I'm bleeding money rent, food gas car insurance, mention necessities like soap whatever. used take bus would take entire afternoon 15 minute drive 45 minute bus ride. small inheritance (that I'm even sure going get rest Uni) life would sustainable. Pandemic dawg. move Canada return 4 years :D Definitely impossible. said cases still going aren‚Äôt

Cases going up? They've flatlined? 34,000 cases yesterday. daily totals April full shit parroting GOP smooth brain bullshit. I'm waiting say COVID killed 9K people panic..I know coming the. keep trying project onto think things great (which I‚Äôve clearly agreed aren‚Äôt) look like enlightened redditor taking public health serious someone else

You're continuously lying cases deaths somehow taking seriously? cashier job Dollar Store make statistician, Cleetus. Oh comes countries blame influx rest. Got it. wonder ladies prefer guys covid. That‚Äôs trump hijacked death toll reports cdc. basically said stop testing people would fewer cases Seems rather important situation hospital risk overrun Probably people South Carolina, well everyone limited resources share.

And point put flames, it‚Äôs good titrate outbreaks. honestly prefer shopping person pandemic Genius. par submarine screen door invented. US doesn‚Äôt level immunity either, neither Sweden (they expected around 40% ended around 15% - 

Herd immunity solution, it‚Äôs still even clear immune covid getting 

Anyway, I‚Äôm going change mind I‚Äôm going spend day trying. Hopefully daily cases start drop death rate continues drop. want that. Good! Health first. Can‚Äôt teach you‚Äôre dead. sub lock-down make sense impossible democracy

When wearing masks make sense stop catching virus

When mass testing make sense nobody capacity

Maybe, something make sense you, means need grow humility learn knows better. one want talk it? mentioned constantly Herd immunity 70-80% population. would take years. Deaths worldometers higher vs day last week. easily defy government's tax orders well? SHC014 banger. people stay in, I'd help weld doors.

(though live, would likely like letting air tires) isn‚Äôt US didn‚Äôt try. President purposefully sowed division undermined states. Yeah, would really helpful right That's empirically false know it. easily see effect lockdowns April decline excess deaths cases, addition effect lifting restrictions increase excess deaths states. sweet summer child. Nobody ever worried re-infection, denied down-played beginning. Standard excuses: Testing error, 1 100 million, lethal,... USA fucked. Fox News spewing crap. Yea COVID mild winter flu right? It‚Äôs people like America laughing stock Fauci satanist. Fauci also proof need Trump also globalist puppet. It‚Äôs fucking show... Sounds like step up.

I'll take moderate forgettable orange senile toddler day. no, Illinois's governor Pritzker effective Trump people claimed following Trump's guidance. Massive testing, tracing, social buy in. Germany done really well. Managing every outbreak spike best can. 

I hope California same, cases dropping. upshot probably get weird looks going forward decide mask get sniffles, caution wintery season.

It anything rhinovirus though. told everyone somehow didn‚Äôt die would disabled forever First, qualified. abundance qualified individuals choose from. 

Second, VP never qualifications. Hell, Sarah Palin complete joke. made religious right happy. religious right didn‚Äôt care McCain‚Äôs integrity unwillingness let tread Constitution. 

Third, far qualified current president. 

What ‚Äúassurance‚Äù standard putting there? come from? Well, rest assured pretty much anyone would less disaster Trump. Forgettable moderate? Clinton forgettable president moderate? get ideas? Called ""crazy"" local Circle K (FL). Also called ""Distance Junkie"" place. unloaded told work COVID19 testing site. would coughed mask, would going far. snickered me.  borrow Boris Johnson want, gives us break chance sort stuff side pond! true all. There's mistakes notably early on, 'handled like shit' something swedes recognise pandemic response as. Comparisons reported statistics isnt good basis judging well handled factors involved numerous perhaps importance. trends useful assessing directions we're heading planning/preparing/mitigating, seldom national level instead regions. 


I also think find success stories US (because big feels crazy weren't), I'm invested enough keep developments detail. American population tends less healthy many countries. lot obese people raises risk severe complications covid.  scare stories virus wrong? I‚Äôm denying COVID tragic many people, including children. 

But pandemic apocalypse, need many people level-headed possible. stories like kids extremely rare. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre making news. Micro herd immunity

I suppose everyone already caught it, there's much say. know deaths completely caused flu ""complications"" it? find numbers?

We're far death ratio first wave Spanish Flu. Spanish Flu worse worse. meant we're path curve cases/deaths looks pretty close pandemic, continues following path, we'll end millions dead winter next spring US alone. lol ok thats youre now.

I‚Äôm fine unlike sub original endpoint efficacy study. realized that, found ""positive"" results shortened hospital stays. cares long national total numbers steadily decreasing. Uh... no. complicated people realize. 

Sweden younger, generally healthier population US. also idiots following basic essential guildelines nationwide keep spread limited. Social responsibility much prevalent there. 

As suspected, got huge spike, eventually came sort plateaued low rate. they're still one highest per capita death rate countries world. think could've saved people personally. Tbh Trump wanted national order masks people would call Fascist . OP‚Äôs point, don‚Äôt think much would‚Äôve changed I'm thinking come election time tune change suddenly dangerous public. Thank goodness kids get two months education, daily proximity classmates happens! relatives (and lot people live) make feel like I'm hallucinating pandemic. mom called extremist today. 2 weeks it‚Äôs results want! shit. in, human body heals viral infection.

There‚Äôs also instances like this, previously infected people reinfected. also reports long term side effects organ damage. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll pay relaxed I‚Äôm afraid. Idk, prefer minimizing risk. I'm amazed many people west multiple bedrooms/bathrooms. Japan vast, vast majority us live apartment one bathroom one bedroom. would literally impossible follow rules spaces like ours.

Nice try Democrat's propaganda. Man sure brainwashed.  I‚Äôm getting quick possible. anyone knows kids human :) ignorant reckless irresponsible thing I've seen year..that insane point, anyone believe anything turd says anymore? Lol getting sad you. Something's fantasy here. contact tracing America is, it'll ironically think we're exceptional. That's fantasy football name takes nothing away wear mask. Seems like we'll beat 200k Oct 1st Ignoring problems decades pretending care people makes look fucking disgusting. Lol. Qatar confirmed cases China!!!!! Look up! Don‚Äôt tell China telling truth.  literally zero threat violence all. None comparable countries Scandinavia. even close. major metropolitan areas mask requirements. Even though they‚Äôre strictly followed times, see people wearing masks inside businesses rare occasion go out. Restaurants excluded course hit miss places. 

The theme parks Orlando reopened (June Universal July Disney), capacity strictly limited 25-30%. Though it‚Äôs even full days. They‚Äôre also limiting activities like shows fireworks cause large groups gather. know least Disney really strict enforcing rules part you‚Äôre outside parks. 

The one thing DeSantis got right shut access retirement homes back March still strict restrictions. 

Overall think recreational activities outdoors sort mask mandate (even it‚Äôs enforced private businesses) helped tremendously. Also, cutting retirement home access helped keep deaths going roof. sure asbestos? mean Nazi's providing families logic. Since 1918 3 flu pandemics least 2x deadly COVID-19.

Why world would social distancing last ""forever""? People like seriously need therapy. mean troll actually believe mean: seriously need seek therapy. We‚Äôre range new cases five months ago, fucking moron IFR coronavirus actually quite low

In places social healthcare thorough testing around 0.15% 0.2%.

The UK recently came 0.3%... based seroprevalence study probably missed huge numbers recovered many (most) showing antibodies saliva tests, blood test.

Going 0.2% means third population already, looking like herd immunity could kick unusually low number looking Sweden. Whoa, slow there. Brits inclined stupid things: voted leave EU (out largest trading partner), voted buffoon prime minister threatening break international treaty law. want us voting US president. US, started fearmongering, turned culture war people ""afraid"" (compliant masks/social distancing) vs people aren't.

I blame people much government failing act necessary. Getting us fight fellow Americans WANT. I'm going part that. Ok. live Australia, things pretty control, low cases numbers 30ish per day quite while. fuck quarantine hotel sparked second wave one state. Cases climbed back around 750 per day, deaths stated climbing. We‚Äôre back lockdown, around 6 weeks now, cases back 40 per day. 

First second wave, it‚Äôs semantics. FACT perhaps people previously covid measure immunity (though still seems air science changing actually works, see link), relax start open lot people going get infected die. isn‚Äôt debate, it‚Äôs fact. It‚Äôs happening real time around  need complete lockdown 2022.

I'm calling troll. like Trump's push back China. feel one place Dems fail pretty hard. Trump things he's done like...but definitely anywhere close outweigh negative. Doesn‚Äôt seem like arguing covid rather principles would reduced deaths too... what‚Äôs threshold apply them? even steps worse that. IL, gov split state regions. regions advanced thru phrases separately based regions covid data.



This makes sense, especially considering densely populated city suburb areas compared rural areas.


But got various counties whining mayors sueing complaining gov allow area different phase region in, due covid counts better surrounding area.


As city island nearby people ever visiting stores families. crazy. Especially living Chicagoland suburbs can't even tell one city ends next begins. commercial math6, people like disgusting. make excuse narrative. tweet outragous thing I've seen weeks. sick Thr number inhabitants matter much island thing.

GB could position got shit together led Euro-Trump. needlessly infected long termers greater legacy. don‚Äôt think state actually enforced anything. feel nice least. could definitely understand  trying blame COVID Trump I'm back addicted opiates again. Trying detox fun. Working home everything shut really fucked mental health talk anyone. individuals stop this. It‚Äôs sad gotten political. People thinking politics comes surviving. politicians cannot stop divided think one another person much control lives. Wear masks, stay inside it‚Äôs essential clean hands, stay distance people! virus go away this! understand. stuff production isn‚Äôt pretty works doesn‚Äôt need changed anytime soon cares language is. system written C++ wouldn‚Äôt say thing. std lib C++ consistently updated large pool developers choose bring needed. we‚Äôre talking language used modern systems pool developers keeps getting smaller so.

Now would time start thinking modernization breaking system focused domains teams use proven languages assignments. 

I hate rewrites too. I‚Äôve company 4 years seen system migrate Ruby Go lead wants Go even though bought .NET company hire new developers rewrite bought. rewrite supposed take year going third. 

Point COBOL system worked great still going long keeping using longer used language new development start migrating ? Oklahoma fair portion recovered actually dead. So, know. aunt nuts?  Would uncle?    

Maybe bunch people would died.  social security financial trouble... cuz us geezers would dead. think covid 2002 2003, bro can't get first wave people hell bent whatever fuck want do..on top lying scumbag president condoning Makes total sense given well already fight flu off, wonder even moderate levels protection distancing enough materially slow flu winter north.

But real interesting question react first flu season behind us. see masks distancing return go back accepting deaths illnesses?  Id say misguided think new directly started conflict (the average Serian would disagree) means anything ware stepping bombing game.

UA System Chancellor Finis St. John latest tease positive news Friday afternoon after¬†Dr. Deborah Birx spoke Tuscaloosa campus.

The numbers went live hours later considerably. 294 students tested positive Sept. 4-10 Tuscaloosa campus recording 846 previous seven days, though Labor Day weekend students away campus Tuesday.

The numbers represent positives identified ‚Äúsentinel testing, point care testing campus health centers, common location exposure testing, self-reported tests private providers,‚Äù according to¬†the dashboard¬†on UA System website.

‚ÄúThe testing we‚Äôve University Alabama working,‚Äù St. John said Friday afternoon. ‚ÄúI could proud students.‚Äù

The number daily positive tests dipped 42 previous seven days figure sat 125 last week. Occupancy isolation/quarantine space 15.18% Friday sitting 39.97% last Friday.

Testing numbers considerably lower UAB UA-Huntsville campuses. new round posted Friday included 27 new cases UAB 11 UA-Huntsville.
 
In all, 2,183 students Tuscaloosa campus tested positive since classes resumed Aug. 19. represents 6.9% student body attending classes main campus according enrollment numbers released Friday.

The numbers still lack degree context better understand situation. AL.com asked Dean UA‚Äôs College Community Health Sciences Dr. Ricky Friend Wednesday breakdown students showing symptoms verses asymptomatic. number hand requests follow ups yielded answer.

In terms localized hospitalizations, DCH Hospital Tuscaloosa reported 47 inpatients treated Friday. That‚Äôs 38 reported Thursday, lowest total months. DCH also reported 3.5% 18-24 tested positive required inpatient care hospital.

The Friday testing numbers followed update campus operations note Vice President Student Life Myron Pope students. relaxing restrictions placed gatherings beginning Monday, Sept. 14 putting new guidelines place two days classes began Aug. 19.

 Dorm study areas reopen along dining rooms ‚Äúwith strict adherence safety guidelines,‚Äù Pope wrote. Colleges departments also hold events maximum 50 people indoors 100 outdoors. students living dorm visit other‚Äôs rooms long masks worn, social distancing observed.

Student organized events still prohibited.

‚ÄúThe gradual loosening moratorium restrictions continue evaluated move forward,‚Äù Pope wrote. ‚ÄúWith continued cooperation, numbers testing student conduct cases continue improve, consider longer-term plans semester.‚Äù Clearly reading comprehension isn‚Äôt strong suit. said deaths per day way since spike April (which are) new cases per day trending since July (which have). know it‚Äôs Friday least wait 5 drink.

I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm arguing anymore. said cases still going aren‚Äôt. proved this. the. keep trying project onto think things great (which I‚Äôve clearly agreed aren‚Äôt) look like enlightened redditor taking public health serious someone else. It‚Äôs truly weird. Dude fuck shit.

Just can't handle responsible mean taking precautions telling people okay hang groups. agree. basically Swedish strategy plus panic, can‚Äôt get messaging right politicized wings.

I know states field hospitals didn‚Äôt use god damn business anymore. hotels took millions. Seems like fair trade still first wave friend Still better Trump. Redditor‚Äôs favorite thing anyways. liberty lives  Weaponized kids Captain Obvious work here. vaccine question. going invite conversation. least read comments first. looking excuse complain wouldn‚Äôt position still national plan &amp; testing strategy. 3 5 fucking days covid test results still major city.

I understand, think weapon, make willing whatever takes stop ? Yep.

According you, per posts, ""covid death sentence.""

However...***we idea post-infection quality life may be, long-term.*** know. know. educated/uneducated guesses.

Welcome risk management. God damn, guys house cars even parked near it. traditional college house people cars need.

The idea go get DUIs instead walk street really stupid. Lockdowns eliminate virus. reason buy us time get hospitals infrastructure ready. Pretty sure nobody except cast alone season 6&amp;7 decades see people wearing mask nose, putting sneeze cough lot lately... got three days sniffles common cold go get covid tested case. 4 days sniffles runny nose that‚Äôs Yeah never know decided release data make conclusions fits positive mindset one wasting time comment ""I heard..."" seen real problem right around globe.

Change attitude maybe world appear differently ;) Right... Boston things relatively normal, good mask wearing percentage social distancing allowed us function safely stats back it. I'm reading comments I'm wondering parts country people from. government health officials lie general public harder us trust them.
And stupid lies. 

1. Wearing Mask won‚Äôt help

2/Children can‚Äôt catch 

3/Children can‚Äôt spread it

4/Children safe go school.

I general Anti-Vaxx person going find very, hard trust vaccines bring rushed production.
No way hell going family vaccinated first even second round. proves people going accept drastic changes every months. Sweden proving exactly consistent approach get everyone side western Europe messed around mixed messaging long. can't fully lockdown, fully open fully lockdown every months expect people comply - rightly hospitals cruise ships... tough choice society needs more, lol. Iran. See [other thread. No, doesn't. Infected sick. forget voter suppression. disclose findings...that rings alarm bells me

EDIT: Mind might possibly someone work exactly type environment hey know? Right? Know online swear parts Wisconsin covid refuse wear mask. PR strat NY article shows bodycam officer. guy throwing party tested positive week before, several people house said covid. USA enters chat look around fucking world?  ""first world"" country still days thousand deaths preventable disease. containable ""eradicated.""  Nice goal posts got though. would love go restaurant cook every.freaking.meal kids husband. really would. something struck wrong whole ‚Äúcome in, sit down, take mask you‚Äôll fine.‚Äù stuck takeout. stupid, course babies pass virus on, don‚Äôt need study prove Examples? said full churches would beautiful. say full caskets funeral's. Wow. Balkanization Europe directly tied it? whole goddamned WORLD changed. no, 1920, things ""back normal."" think that, failed History. Beside women protection paragraph, find resolution article [Jerusalem Israel voted United States opposing United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution aimed toward combating coronavirus pandemic due last-minute Cuban amendment called countries **oppose unilateral economic, financial trade sanctions**, later overwhelmingly passed 169-2 vote favor, Associated Press reported Friday.

Which means, beside Cuba, Iran.

From worth, I'm glad rest world opposes bully. Finally conclusive studies this!!

I though infected daycare can‚Äôt pass on.. thank god article prove otherwise previously said Fall 2020, so... Experience, age, understanding history. 

Once again: USA one nation earth right steadfastly denies reality virus. that, socio-economic culture pushed everyone ""try return normal.""

We lead world infections deaths, per capita, mathematical factors. keep trying ""return normal"" we're immune virus ""just cold."" 

As noted another reply: old enough remember HIV changed *everything* day. change scary, significant percentage population lived denial - almost everyone knew someone directly affected. 

We ""returning normal"" 2 years. 10 years. significant change, denying *will absolutely lead pointless death tolls.*  surprised, bet 2022... strange though. thought bioengineered, take seriously? injection something. really seem enjoy putting words people's mouths. said, parents asked person classes private school. school tends paying customer wants.

Keep mind kid 16 kids class, rotating 8 kids person time. Plus busses worry about. kids respect rules (or get kicked out).

So yes, private schools (hopefully) get away covid risks public schools Covid given chance fix sleep schedule. used wake around 9:30am weekends. wake around 7:30am every day without alarm. definitely see that‚Äôs typical though. Link? Especially considering fair share due lockdowns, disease itself.

Liar. OK. Tell me. efficient vaccine allow us get back normal? Great, get prize. What, World's stupidest population, normal? thought April 1? Still gonna affect America negative way ""We"" need stop lecturing everyone. Thanks update shilldog Next Christmas! previously covid? that‚Äôs case it‚Äôs fine aren‚Äôt contagious anymore..

You can‚Äôt blanket statement anyone who‚Äôs ever covid rest lives longer able function group..

People recover recovering phase internal immunity. America‚Äôs voting system always related landownership. moment find vaccine provides immunity I'll take approved. Even means take every 6 months.  Exactly. latest mouthpieces particular conspiracy theory talking about. ignores people get infected vaccine stops getting sick Fish sauce. Walmart def it. shopping Walmart pickup. correct size item, get bigger size price. item all, they'll sub another flavor brand. also text make sure ok subs.

To add, see many complaining produce, would make sense unload old stuff fresh.

Thanks wasting time. welcome. Change attitude. Corona take holiday back tuesday data DUMB government official* point doomday predictions far outside common sense anybody good. Saying going insanely huge death count fuels feeling scientists can't trusted. reality likely happening range 260-440 media taking highest number running story that. course Reddit gobbles shit up. Wait till see weekend results plummet write article too.

Then write another one mid week results show going back up. 7day averages reporting flawed Thank God haven't. 3.02 death rate per thousand infected, versus Italy's 12.86, UK's 11.2, EU's overall rate 7.3, Canada's 6.9 Chinas 5.2. 
Sorry burst leftist death wish narrative. lol. see: 
 Johns Hopkins researchers point several factors seeking temper Sturgis study's explosive findings, San Diego researchers compare geographic areas hit coronavirus infections Sturgis nearby areas. example, county Arizona compared counties Maine Hawaii despite significant differences populations mask-wearing habits two areas. 
 Sturgis rally likely caused people get coronavirus test given numerous warnings event potential health risks. increase testing ‚Äî direct transmission people rally ‚Äî could explain jump reported cases. method used put public health cost $12 billion Sturgis rally simplistic fails reflect costs treating people COVID-19 vary widely around country. No, anyone denial. makes think things like forever? K Yeah, really looking 7 day average. :) Ask Reddit Border's closed say  couple years. 1920 everything America returned normal. It‚Äôs fine need made sure spread controlled keep going, going outbreaks everywhere need keep pushing through.

Fatality rates 60yrs old similar flu rates, prexisting conditioned people shouldn‚Äôt going school imo 

Asthma heart conditions immune compromised going seen bullshit posts FB? Tons posts idiots saying they're building immunity sun. I'm making damn thing go anywhere there's approved vaccine Fauci trusts... conspiracy idiot theorists building Vitamin reports studies adding bullshit them. quite 500 yes might true India but, based FDA said, likely untrue USA  Cuties French film. Bars open around month now. went got food licenses.  remember back March, thought would completely ridiculous think America would ever get Italy's point. Young, healthy, mild symptoms. 30% evidence recent damage. 15% showed damage MRI. really encouraging. Vivan nuestros vecinos de arriba! Yo cago en t√≥ la hostia del puto crown virus este de los cojones. Mucha fuerza, Francia! denial. Yeah, Sturgis really showed us false statement is, RiGhT ?  thought banned.

It's let us in. Thats lesson German learned. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article make poll say whatever want.

For example poll ask country think country management, compare America Canada  guys even saying fake news is?? Cnn Fox every government news agency America lied many times trusted go to? Please I‚Äôm asking know.  course older people retarded though.

That's worrying part. I'm sure defines wave never pandemic like before, even Spanish flu behaviour.

The Spanish flu 2-3x worse second wave, counts deaths cases. Based certainly second wave means. Spain rise deaths, US August. could national deaths result really hot summer. 

I fully agree virus here, vaccinate risk groups vaccine available. Apart Business usual soon. admin despicable. welcome continue social distancing wearing mask forever more. people vaccine use. 

Are scared shadow too? Oh desire live free homejailed without due process american bullshit? people naturally want live world absolutely controlled obey without questions?

Im american fuck lockdowns. would too. American brainwashing conducted Australian. It‚Äôs happening uk Australia too. us infected Australian propaganda bullshit first trying spread everywhere. call caution also risky. Living severely restricted lives extremely damaging psychologically. People sub often forget Covid isn‚Äôt risk moral weigh scale. Tel go look fucking graph fucks sake. Cases HUGE, plummeted slight uptick. ‚ÄúFirst wave‚Äù? serious. think virus gives single tenpenny fuck whether ""fear"" not? Lmao. reality remains unchanged gentlemen. dark days begun. Yes. tactic probably effective sustainable long run. People follow rules better focus easy rules like distancing limit spread instead eradicate everyone household COVID-19, still point isolating rooms? point nonsensical. novel zoonotic virus humanity little control vaccination at-risk groups. China basically eradicated local transmission still imported cases. lots people working border, also tens thousands Chinese workers sent overseas countries increasing number cases, emergency authorization receive vaccine. know cruise lines best keep much shore money pocket possible.

Restrictions/lockdowns buy time effective government response take effect. doesn‚Äôt matter 100 percent perfect compliance...one infection makes cycle starts again. get legitimate n95s 3m, moldex, reputable brand. Harley availabile 5 6 dollar brand. 

The KN95s actually pretty good buy reputable manufacturer FDA appendix list. korean kn94s also good too, Botn one better ones. agree that. Also lot people think rights violated wear mask. countries also histories wearing masks feel sick mask wearing much accepted. 

We‚Äôre individualistic country really hurt us covid 19 terrible federal response restrictions varying state state. Canada. provinces restrictions. Hell, mask mandates Ontario done municipalities province, point EVERY municipality one, might well province wide. gave choice wanna virtual learn can, every Friday come school take test. think mother law teacher said it‚Äôs like 40% chose virtual rest school attending.

at time DHEC updated website.

&amp;#x200B;

Also note SC DHEC Director resigned yesterday take job Ohio 7 hours later Ohio retracted N95 3M masks valve valve ever open unless breath harder ever would normally. Competition mauschwitz read here's study mistaking CFR IFR leads wrong repsonse - saw.  half clearly recovered fast 
But recovering slowly hell problem last thing rushing vaccine. Stop spreading crap. Honestly I‚Äôd ever seen good things Sweden got cases completely down. Maybe sources angrier mine, genuinely saw people praising it. movie every single character telling one something, anyway disaster strikes

But maybe that's looks like I'm Canada swear must said 50 times back April everyone freaking ridiculously high death rate. course death rate exaggerated people hospital admission ill tested... 

In March could get test Italy China. even NHS key workers could get tested. Wasn‚Äôt advice stay home 7 days symptoms phone 111 got worse 7 days maybe maybe you‚Äôd get test. 

The increases bad take action slow could escalate quickly numbers way compared confirmed figures March/April. joke keep sharing line graph news... wish they‚Äôd make clearer around 10% cases recorded weeks lockdown. Yeah, everybody spoke Trump cult rally--- mean RNC--- told us so.  That‚Äôs shame...but numbers don‚Äôt match actually reported state.

Like everywhere, SC cases, positivity deaths down. I'm tired guy. joke now. Democrats want play election. want normalcy. Soooo, averaging stats useful pushes agenda, goes it, suddenly it‚Äôs bad? anything, shows two much worse. bet get away too..like people parents Except cop responded. sort incident, risk increased kind environment drink party sick, first responders also would exposed.

Furthermore, know viral load affect severity illness, also incredibly stupid idea. taken disease seriously killed least 193,000 americans?

Tests may sensitive, mean virus less deadly. got sooooo much shit July said US outbreak would start decline August.

Right money. 

The denial sub virus cannot go indefinitely strange.


Eventually burns out. may cause problems. People die. may take awhile virus....it fades away. 

The last month virus fading across US insanely hard Sub handle. Well paying attention half Reddit, U.S. ""In total 100% lockdown ""fOrEvEr!!!!"" underground bunker since Jan 1st, 1919 Covid-19!


/$ What‚Äôs point? statistician government could seen coming!""

Scientist here. work pushing information early end January, say second week February, significant concerns safety supply chains. could wrong, feel fairly confident saying - everyone White House knew, care. feel like I‚Äôve heard story kids trading masks school.  Here's hoping scientists properly fudge anything. believe will, there's lot BS world right shareholders want lose big money Interesting. What‚Äôs weird see 2,000 number click SC. wish would add previous date that‚Äôs case, counting doesn‚Äôt make sense me. also day added like 5,000 cases Texas day took health department website update lol. like WorldMeter lists sources tho. Lockdowns nothing aren‚Äôt utilized government prepare.

You (almost) absolute perfect compliance one case starts spreading nothing.

Remember, Texas, Florida Arizona opened numbers pretty good. No, coordinated response. See, matter much there's like three people total Nebraska.

/s every site including cdc said dangerous? I've paying plenty attention..i see read stupidity everyday includes today Look widely available graphs deaths cases see lag fairly short. Who's ""we""? Sweden locked hard all. still even recommend masks public transit. Bars, schools, shops never closed even day. 

Sweden FAR least amount restrictions US State. FAR.

The virus faded away.

They 10 million people 13 left ICU. random population survey found 0.0% general population virus.

It's over.

I bring Spain. Spain herd immunity yet. Wtf - approaching one million dead worldwide less 9 months still rising, yet people think over-reacted. human life really cheap? guys cant get past Hillary. relevant nearly 4 years. KN95s good, ones 5 layers adjustable ear loops make tight fit. cuts air flow way down, notice immediately. Better surgical masks gaps let air sides. worse 1 15k placebo? Taiwan: less 500 cases country, community spread, *still* mandate masks busses, public trans public places know another wave could hit anytime.  thing businesses years. nothing money dad gave him, would wealthy assume happens. Shut downs pretty much lockdowns, least major first step towards it.

They aren‚Äôt things right like Sweden. Literally biggest thing past months everyone SHOULDN‚ÄôT like Sweden. lockdown kill people. San Marino Andorra populations 100K. They're really comparable, they're left rankings. Sealand mortality rate 0 standard. successful country, since residents. Antarctica really flattened curve! makes sense. feel this. many people around us going like nothing different. keep wondering we‚Äôre right thing 100% isolating even family preemie super high risk. stupid things like go church one wearing mask go volunteer senior citizens. Oh mom thinks long *they* wear masks fine, let brother bunch friends stay night?

And realize, *I‚Äôm crazy one I‚Äôm risking son‚Äôs life people!* don‚Äôt like fork off! Sweden herd immunity, pretty locked right (but quietly). Spain hit hard start, would think herd immunity - no, going again. Huh? NYC walk urgent care center every single day get test free despite zero symptoms. sure shit take 1 5000 odds. People understand (can't comprehend refuse acknowledge) words 'highly-infectious' mean. County Health Officer Dr. Gene Shelby said public focus getting used ""new normal"" instead getting back ""old normal,"" virus going continue ""a long time.""



Translation: Quit asking, ""Are yet?"" every 5 minutes bedrooms italy quite common main bedroom kids bedroom. according person quarantined enforce separation quite easily switching accordingly. 

As bathrooms apartments one bathroom last 20 years new buildings usually main bathroom plus small one. guess since normal parents working share bathroom 3 4 everyone tight schedule school/work convenient. That's assuming. hope come choice UBI healthcare all, makes sense former would benefit insurance companies more. Yeah imagine caught it. even cancel spring break, lock everyone room week.

The school cancelled spring break, still class. get two days, Feb. 9 / Mar. 31 instead week whatever row. called adaptation. human. remind remain pandemic, mind returned subjects. saying last ""years"" genuinely moron.

This statement age well... also linger years worst case cause paralysis. That's me. It‚Äôs worked far, stop now? source proves wrong. Look deaths per million (what mentioning before) actually US 11th ranking, sorry. used one. LA public health may also wary in-person voting causing spike case numbers.

But pushing mail-in ballots months. In-person voting seem like big concern. paying attention. count 1 30k really really rare, we're talking side effect potentially paralyse you. big gap ‚Äúnever get vaccine vaccines cause risk‚Äù and, proven, rare neurological issues already found relatively negligible number doses (compared hundreds millions get vaccine.) don‚Äôt know make anymore clear. drew graph cases middle July today line best fit would line going down. rolling 7 day average going month half now. You‚Äôre actually embarrassing yourself. Total US. can‚Äôt follow chart you‚Äôre helpless. That‚Äôs good assumption. faith world democrats fuck again. Agreed. Shut isn‚Äôt lockdown imo. could talking example California salons opening again. necessarily lockdown*. you‚Äôre one asked countries things right. answered how. enforcing rules like Sweden. Uh, yeah. Like lot. Sadly, he‚Äôs going Based legacy far.

What significance beyond vp status given? accomplishments himself?

On grounds think successful?  much misinformation it‚Äôs criminal. took forever figure think explain differences cases. lot states daily reported cases also redistribute backlog cases appropriate days. Worldmeters take daily add previous day additions report total current day I've read peer reviewed scientific journals mention proper way look looking CFR, please go lol.

How calculate ""true"" infection rate people tested positive it?

Also, numbers true, there'd 100 million infections. come conclusion additional 94,000,000 cases top we've confirmed testing? taught numbers 10 write word. highly doubt anything going shut anything else done try lessen cases.

That sounds like pretty much direct indication lockdowns? sure thread you‚Äôre reading. Armenians - know stuff... Canada neither technically national strategy, provinces restrictions.  think applies schools? 

After election day seems big convenient. rile public, especially believe virus worry Biden wins.  But.. said inherited broken system. cupboards empty. Obama's fault!!!!!!!!!shift-1 trust specific administration approve vaccine. Outliers aside, nobody problem idea FDA general, open corruption current administration. part universe things constitute oppression Black people U.S. many documented forms oppression keep Black people disadvantage financially, physically educationally. Oppression overtly violent. Oppression occurs dominant group uses power keep another group inferior position. Looking US situation Finland, looked beginning state New York (where first big outbreak US) nice work, virus spread parts US, things fell apart. ambition cover entire US manage situation New York. wasn‚Äôt rebuttal. stating facts Wow. in: human human contact spreads infectious diseases. contagious. Much spread.  aside, although Lincoln-Lancaster county mask mandate, state office buildings Lincoln exempted mask order. Plenty no-maskers NSOB. me. Mid March 2020 feels like eternity ago. thing math? virus kill math? 

Oh fuck right. tried division nothing happened.

Damn CORONAVIRUS!!! things go right, know takes credit... seriously one pet peeves. go mechanic tell fix car. sure go upstairs chem majors tell fucking reduce esters. 

Your arrogance astounding.

Stay lane chemist. relevant expertise South Carolina reported 951, don‚Äôt even know WorldMeter got extra 1,500.

WorldMeter pretty confusing data. It‚Äôs good go sources supposedly get data, look site posted actual data posted state is, it‚Äôs usually different. example, Texas reported 3,488 cases 144 deaths, WorldMeter 4,191 120 deaths. huge count cases undercount deaths, gives. COVID Tracking project much accurate date, WorldMeter confusing. making common mistake non-scientists often do.

You talking case fatality rate (CFR) ignores cases detected.  need measure IFR (infection fatality rate) includes infections COVID, ones found testing. owner say that? reports COVID cases daycares across US months now.

Also, good taking child daycare. easy make happen, keep children home. feel bad parents choice. get might bit difficult get 50 states one table 16, least outside seems even try.

As American, didn't. US avenues 50 states come together like this, Congress exists one hand, there's National Governor's Association help facilitate coordination collective states national government. Plus, Trump worked discredit them, CDC viewed general respect guidelines would largely followed consistent message present start.   Hurray (con)federalism! want take look cases/100k Europe past 2 weeks tell Swedish strategy isn‚Äôt working HERE.

sure long count Swedish folks died beginning September, yall bang job. hell, count Swedish deaths, yall best saying 5800 deaths achievement either, massive mistake authorities. also massively pro-lockdown pandemic began, still would wanted something similar lovkdowns Denmark, Finland, Norway etc.

Well that's good yall fucked bad order magnitude (literally) deaths per capita Norway compared Finland(588 61). Hell, yall 6 times deaths per capita Denmark Scandinavian country closest per capita comments posts massive linkdump generally asshole high horse isn‚Äôt going make difference Germany. government competent knows doing. authorities Sweden exact same.

Perhaps, apparently Norway's Finland's governments roughly 10 times better based death rate.

Yall fucked up.

Own it.

Similar, US fucking mightily.

also, couple links massive linkdump accuse guy brigading. got proof that? changes theater aside seat reservations? Eat entire asshole Crazy, almost like children teeny tiny versions humans, weird. thing adjusting population. Stop it, lol. HIV generation time measured years. SARS-CoV-2 generation time measured days. transmission rate equal reproduction number divided mean generation time. abusing R0 really highlighting anything useful difference HIV SARS-CoV-2, spreading doubt. Lol, no. millions deaths thing worst case scenario predicted would happen NOTHING. clearly that's happened. 

And death rate around 3%, 0.20%. Might want check math one.

193,000 deaths/6,450,000 cases = 2.99% death rate. Universal healthcare. People get treatment sick.

Universal childcare. People go back work easily.

Willing wear masks 

Paid sick quarantine compliance higher. Again? miss something? Sweden actually enforced rules US won‚Äôt. literally google Sweden‚Äôs covid strategy, since beginning placed social distancing guidelines. Arkansas did. Like last month started barely enforcing it. USA whole would something rather states acknowledging things &amp; others not, wed get farther. strategy set like marathon, sprint. It‚Äôs meant last long term. states, guidelines come go cases go up. N95 masks exhilation valve ate obviously letting spread. Lots people worried first infection. taking precautions, makes think I'm not? Anyway *is* OK hang small groups live. blame state gotten control virus yet. follow science agree it. Gotcha/. start pandemic people thinking crisis would unite us. happened instead great divide gotten even wider. course, look charge encouraging division... leave job state

Yeah, maybe move South Dakota. hear really great vacation destination must amazing live there. /s 2-3% death rates case fatality rates, artificially inflated due lack testing. abundance testing reason 10k cases day today even close 10k cases day March. 

The upshot France isn‚Äôt anything special. virus much less prevalent 6 months ago. death rates seeing much closer true IFR ton mild cases unaccounted back day. Florida governor like : 300 firefighters alone really PhD chemistry extremely aware takes expert field defer proper experts

Yeah, deference experts field. Turns COVID puzzle biology decide shutter economy months.

You bio-med people let little power importance go heads really quick. Trump president senate majority next term dictator life. ignored justice lawfulness now, even blatant second term would subject things anyore. 

This coming election election whether US wants keep semblance democracy whether want hand reigns dictator style Putin. Prosecutions like work Putin, need functioning democracy work.

Your guarantee worth nothing. Awww, look trying think, that's cute!  
Now make funny face. Cancel Anthony Fauci Oh is. bio-weapon nonsense. know. virus sentient gaining access nuclear codes speak. USA #1 üá∫üá∏ can't congress vote it? insane nobody checks numbers. facts really strong suit among people pushing narrative. IL, WA, MI also hit early ended middle pack well, impossible make this, pretty clear going get nursing homes anywhere there's alot spread. moment realize person you‚Äôre chatting online someone would literally get leave restaurant even sat next table... 1-4 million flu.

Adjusted population comes like 2.5-10+ million. India worst death rates world right now. even counting correctly. parent's neighbors passed away due ""flu like symptons"" breathing issues. bodies quickly cremated without giving access anyone. initially said covid backtracked gave death certificate flu. No, moment became politicized Red vs Blue, ""Government Incompetent,"" every single government nation lost ability right thing eyes opposing political party. local state national, matter policy set deal pandemic, viewed lens Democrat Republican. wants quiet. Arguments iduots insulted throughout whole thing, getting point everyone else did, leaving conversation. rinse repeat someone never explained sure? areas UK mobile testing sites test anyone wants test. Admitedly available nationwide happen. Surely countries also? would work? believe you, I'm curious.  .03%? 

190k deaths 6.5million around 3% mean even trump put policy place half country would follow it. problem data point (your dad), business focused long term health impacts virus has. lot evidence research pointing pretty results covid-infection due virus cardiovascular nature (aka affect anything blood vessels it) Really well written article fucking screwed. three weeks drop, able argue drop.

currently drop.

I make prediction future, corrected current state. apparently read text well graphs. Well goes right wing narrative! trash garbage United States, meanwhile, sweeping legal restrictions social economic activity, despite enormous costs imposed, obvious impact upward trajectory cumulative COVID-19 deaths. 

It obviously did, deaths resumed ones restrictions lifted early south. curiosity, Sweden? True. point out, get downvoted hell it. 

I dont wear mask protect others. dont like social pressure part save lives, save masks medical, that. Like, shit I'll take precautions protect family. chick refuses wear mask wont stand 6ft away? Nah, dont care gets infected. honestly get point. 

Sars-Cov-2 end eventually. 

Either vaccine, herd immunity enough population exposure already occurred Sweden, Arizone, etc, attenuate, treatments improve already have. 


Anybody saying last ""years"" genuinely moron. Saying ""permanent"" sign somebody trolling mentally unfit needs get internet seek therapy. much novichock Hey media, take note. Every time read headline ""the fifth wave"" whatever throw mouth S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Wuhan ""dine unmasked"" kind implies options.

i mean, maybe really hip people wearing gas masks boutique iv drips heard it. locked campus, going class, getting door-drop delivery, sure.

My pregnant wife teacher might disagree you, otherwise. argument completely absurd. 

Covid 19 deaths 900k now! 8 calender months!! 

They well 1million 12 mos.

If triple, would 2.7million. 

Your math needs checked.
2.7mil 1mil worst fear outbreak Canada may realized. Multiple provinces (BC, AB, ON, QC) larger larger outbreaks time moves schools reopening reopened.

We saw United States schools reopened there--whether elementary school, high school post-secondary institutions. knew would happen sooner later side border matter time.

We closed schools 6 months, may probably reopen 1 month less, re-close again. anything. CAN'T anything fucking stupid authoritarian listen anyone smart. People shit Trump. Wait till hear BJP bhakts brigading reddit. coincidence worst affected countries US, India, Brazil Russia.


We cursed stupid PMs. cursed evil PMs. know ever cursed stupid evil PM like NAMO brigade. emperor clothes virus laying bare. agree, especially areas people refuse wear masks N95's valve allowed. cite source cop probably get tested couple times hopefully walk back PD station not. *holy fuck* got huge argument brother Labor Day this. INSISTS listened whole briefing ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt say that‚Äù. 

I made pull listen official whole specifically said bleach kills virus followed Trump saying wonders anything could disinfected injection. 

He angry insisted that‚Äôs meant. called brother moron told pull head ass apparently wasn‚Äôt acceptable according family. 

Consequences damned. Someone speak truth loud. We'll second place India soon enough, buddy. Hang there. dunno... Northeast seem trailing significant spikes... second wave bump # cases, increased testing (~50k tests/day) feel like becoming small bastion semi-normalcy. 

That said, still taking precautions put place weeks leading lockdown. mixing pubs restaurants still perfectly safe... actually wondering covid would blow India. Early report showed little cases.  100 percent agree basically saying leaks out. infected person's breath escapes. 

It's saying virus goes in. light end one way another stated. experts HOPE 75% vaccine accept 50-60%. 

You still get sick. Vaccine mean safe mean life go back normal. Soo think herd mentality way this... yiiikes. coach trying get season started mid October? think that's commonly done - N95 valve one medical ones valve. No. still seems indications long term heart damage happening. think final word yet. disagree Ah yes, ""virtue signalling"". wearing mask, listening experts, using common sense fucking hard worth lives saves. AZ, GA, SC, TX surpassed NY nursing home deaths per capita resident. FL soon cant buy legit ones. reputable companies backed orders well next year.

The KN95s China shouldnt trusted either. large number fakes dont protect. 1918
1957
1968

All 3 killed one million people (for low end estimate) adjusted fact world population smaller MUCH smaller (see: 1918) 3 pandemics substantially deadly COVID-19

COVID-19 deaths could literally triple still top 3.

So statement accurate wrong. Time consolidate border wall, paid ~~Mexicans~~ southern neighbors. People concerned vaccine comes November rushed tested enough safety/efficacy Trump wanted push vaccine election boost reelection chances. understand people coming honestly I'm worried much, scientists regulators behind integrity keep saying automatic weapons. don‚Äôt think actually know definition automatic weapons is. course do, differentiate path infection. data shows children good carriers infect others, study EU CDC went situations sick children went class cause outbreaks students. genomic data showed children rarely spreading virus, definitely catch adults. CDC saying kids gave other, especially kids 11 years old, goes data reasoning EU Asia schools minimal restrictions young children. *sudden flashbacks childhood*

Not parents üòû Infections per day decreased last 7 days. way numbers reported Spain different countries. said 10k one day. 10k positive results processed day. allocate actual day test sample taken. shows clear decrease right now. 

Also numbers reported weekend. always leads confusion. It‚Äôs best wait Friday every week see allocated tests. 

It went 8k day week ago, 4.7k yesterday. clear decrease. When? assholes everywhere? America? Well, almost makes feel little bit better realize still percentage humanity sucks general. I'm pro-vaccine. I've worked vaccine development decades. Calling anti-vaxxer ignorant best. brave, pragmatic community-spirited person.

Not everybody like that. depressing many people like that. discovering things people wish know. depends store though. hyvee town substitute similar item, beef ramen chicken ramen great example. specific item choose one. think walmart well! Maybe ask specific grocery store substitute items? Except know, German... Try feeder timer. Don‚Äôt forget fill it, though. mornings aren‚Äôt great. silver lining tragedy dying time meant neither time miss one. earth allow Americans come Germany? 
They demonstrate day day out, statistics behavior great amount citizens allowed countries better Covid19. Drink sober Quelle d√©b√¢cle! tied date US elections. lot Americans distrust one released date due current administration's track record lying. (Not saying would, that's issue.) Excellent, well sourced good interpretation story. Herd immunity vaccines. Look Sweden. Great overly optimistic. safe stay inside late 2023 minimum even deaths zero. Anything less would reckless disregard human life failure virtue signal IMO. Chances completely eradicating virus basically zero due it‚Äôs highly transmissibility. Getting cases deaths zero unrealistic fantasy.

edit: HIGH transmissibility Mon dieu! someone please ELI5 going happen? understand basis people inside colder weather increase virus spread, going model determine this? sure thing it? guys 6 month lockdown Ontario? Really? BC like 3 bad enough. 6 month lockdown would destroy economy people‚Äôs mental physical health insane level.

Even weather gets worse would expect widespread non compliance attempts lockdown BC. first lockdown much people going tolerate seems apparent lockdowns kick street months. effective vaccine isn‚Äôt months lockdowns may accomplished little make economic damage caused pandemic even worse. think behavior two groups. People taking public transportation get somewhere like work. People eating because... know. like taste cooking? Libya Iraq

We give freedom. ""People around France reported long queues get tested several days get results.""

When u hit testing crunch u're probably spike  You‚Äôre bad math. Look Sweden. Exactly. single incident. people supposed smart soon educated, mention they're future. 

Maybe climate change consequences bad lose much. United States elections happen November.

Although, say fan Trump stretch imagination, anybody hopes pandemic causes damage increase chances preferred candidate wining sort sucks. Yea insurance (non union job) don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs happens. Like right people laid longer insured. they're forced wear hazmat suits... REST LIFE. virus never fully eradicated fat heart strain every beat makes likely die COVID? Shocking tell you, shocking. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Multiple layers cotton fabric make best masks. get Etsy. Medical masks good less comfortable can't wash reuse them.

Polyester masks bandanas good. Try blowing them, like would blow candle. feel breath finger, working well.

I see lot people using ""counts"" mask, ""passes"" mask. want tell them, point satisfy rule. point spread disease. Get good mask use right, hanging ear, nose, chin. Get nice cotton mask Etsy wear right way. means it‚Äôs half effective I'm sorry dad like this, good trying reason educate him. 

Lots say here, I'm sure much helpful, goes... I'll offer thoughts point-by-point dad's comments. ‚Äúwhy corona revealed testing done? aren‚Äôt people reporting themselves? mean, don‚Äôt see people dying streets able breath. don‚Äôt get spread people still somehow ok‚Äù

I'm sure point trying make saying ""why corona revealed testing done""... like, *of course* case. Pregnancy tests confirm pregnancies. HIV tests confirm HIV. examples, people could (in theory) walking around knowing pregnant, knowing HIV positive, test confirms it. Similarly, COVID tests confirm COVID. supposed weird ""aha, gotcha"" moment dad's part supports theory COVID hoax, testing equals higher numbers, make sense. Testing equals higher *confirmed* numbers. 

""Why people reporting themselves"": ...but dad, are? hundreds thousands? live (Toronto), lineups hospitals hours hours long, many people right thing getting tested, whether mild symptoms whether think might exposed symptoms. Again, point dad's makes sense. 

""We don‚Äôt see people dying streets able breath""... they're hospital point. People get sicker sicker, begin struggle breathe go hospital, either A) get lucky recover get out, B) die there. 

I admit, element ""out sight, mind"" COVID. hard, mentally, gauge gravity situation can't really *see* body toll, human face it. Human brains notoriously bad comprehending contextualizing large numbers, easy figures like ""190,000 Americans dead"" ""900,000 dead worldwide"" to... mean much anything all. point, people rolling around passing away streets, zombie apocalypse-style, countries digging massive open graves bodies, people like dad might easier time ""getting it"" cluing in. is, hard us contextualize it. mean people dying massive, massive scale. scarier, surviving horrible affects (strokes, heart attacks, permanent lung damage) reflected death tolls, people simply marked ""recovered"". tried explaining asymptomatic mild, still covid-19

Like say, I'd hammer point home him, one scariest parts virus lot people may asymptomatic. fine (maybe? long term effects unknown, we'll get minute), fine many people come contact unknowingly spread to, particularly folks vulnerable. 

Did ever ""double penny, twice day"" logic problem school? goes like this: take $1000 front, take $0.01, doubles every day 30 days. many/most seems like $1000 would make sense... doubled $0.01 ends $5.3M 30 day mark. guess point I'm making spread, things double, pretty significant, there's evidence support COVID (pronounced ""r naught"") 2, similar penny problem (if precautions taken). 1 people infect 2, infect 4, infect 8... suddenly we're million. 

If you, I'd leave dad two sentiments:

One, know virus' long term effects be. post went viral summer initially misattributed Fauci, him. Regardless, well said. TLDR, talks things like herpes, AIDS, stay system *for ever* still understand fully, we've decades learn. COVID terrifying regard. 

Two, forget quote came from, making rounds early pandemic, went something like ""success COVID look like overreaction"". well this, look like everything okay extremely overreacted. That's now. need keep up.

Yup - throw everywhere within 50 minute drive Bedford Basin, get Truro, Wolfville / Kentville, Lunenburg / Bridgewater towns lots traffic back forth city due commuting, Universities, government, cottages / tourism. 90 km bubble must approach 70% population.

Nope. Stay frosty alert. ""Be here, now"" say. seen toddler cough? one disgusting things ever/worth vasectomy opinion. elaborate bit: Alberta elected right wing party every election *1935 2015*, finally elected left wing party.

What finally caused left wing party win 2015? took combination Premier straight blaming recession corruption party populace, (He literally told Albertans ‚Äúlook mirror‚Äù) conservative party literally splitting two parties.

And went straight back right wing government last year, party ran heavily platform *privatizing health care system*. Pfizer's -95 degrees celsius, Moderna's like -5 degrees celsius. Much reasonable Moderna's RNA based vaccine. actual vaccine proves dangerous? better scrap one focus vaccines work? vaccine worse virus due pushed despite bad data?  vaccination would even harder convince people wear masks socially distance, despite immunity coin flip.  need keep economy shut election. vaccine comes soon Trump get credit better election. combined strong economy good Democrats. Hey, I'm sorry really common knowledge I'm loop, ... recent news Russian vaccine working? vaccinating people en mass? found (by someone safely reach Putin's grasp) safe/effective? deaths occurred nursing homes. Chinese cultures like Taiwan strong traditions institutionalization elderly. country low nursing home commitment rates would much lower death rates. island also helps prevention imported cases. surprised, France country world restrictions eased most. moment literally everything open ridiculous minimal forced restrictions measures.

I hope failure warning countries. Technically grandson. :D

Looking data, we're actually pretty close: Again, ‚Äòcases‚Äô. good podcast Michael Mina shows current testing flawed even body contains minute amounts Coronavirus -that would never develop virus cause infection- test comes back positive. think amount positive tests peak 0 deaths?

Just like forced pay them. nothing less extinction virus acceptable level, sound correct? agree sounds totally fantastic, think realistic measure given scale earth transmissible is?

I mean think practical measures could take agreed them, could also eradicate HIV, don‚Äôt think realistic expect people would follow it. feel way forbidding people contact one another point. Lofty idea, people won‚Äôt go along. Americans need help sure.

Dr. Fauci said repeatedly. like Vaccine(s) magic bullets virus disappear month! takes time forced herd immunity spread population quell outbreaks. anti-vaxxers skeptics prolong it. We'll next summer yelling trust vaccine big government whoever, begging &amp; pleading get family inoculated. free riders Achilles heel next year. looking get covid testing asymtomatic person looking travel... it‚Äôs challenge finding this.. challenging jurisdictions allow anyone get tested? Assuming physical classes full swing, jobs reopening, holiday season full swing, increasing chances non-compliance 6-feet social distancing. Winter also sees higher viral activity, cold flu season effect. Drier, cooler temps causes people inside more. hear lower humidity allows viruses ""linger"" air bit easily. + possible complacency mask usage. Oh! je vois things open way like two months already... know many people wanna swedes sense accept universal cultural rules (like developed countries have). anything skin color everything accepting common sense behavior (respecting law, constitution). Freeze entered chat Approval, funding, peer review, publication - plus actual research takes time. Without process, would good science, though. sort time frame mention suggests studying people want know starting gets asked, finding facts takes time verification, many examples poorly-done studies gloss parts process thus give incorrect information, harm ability find answers even harm people directly, sort like convicting wrong person crime lets criminal get scot-free.

Lets hope get Chinese vaccine quickly. think it‚Äôs positive organ damage said might permanent seems heal time. Norway needs nurses. Look comments done even two seconds research.

I curious find apparently stolen mask design, took look. basic masks, actually slightly different design, color. OK gold chains. what, can't patent fashion trend. bet different target market anyway.

I shocked see woman late 20s. done herself? looks like late 40s... Wishing best New Zealand Commonwealth cousins. Boomer Polish jokes. Yeaaaaah lot folks hospitals still die, guy. hit herd immunity all, whatsoever. areas Stockholm 25% may antibodies- whole country it‚Äôs less 5%. herd immunity need 60-70%. also cases people getting re-infected, means ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù may even something achievable. 

The reason infections went Sweden simply disciplined responsibly acting population, one even denies existence virus. approach may appropriate Sweden (albeit high cost), wouldn‚Äôt worked countries. USA BETTER THO changed determine covid death bye sure let‚Äôs ignore compared US. [Cap'n That's exactly dude said lol. Canadians Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch. Hold I'll find video. didn‚Äôt make vaccine. AstraZeneca Oxford university made it, set test sights around world test areas high infection rates get accurate data. 

Brazil India main two locations. Nothing Brazilian government, common sense people Oxford. There's road work going outside house whole time. cops there, right next construction workers, one point fucking TEARING ROAD, dust flying everywhere... none wearing masks. Fucking really? really trying prove point wear mask circumstances NORMAL to. way NB finally made masks mandatory Superstore Sept 1st even basket disposable masks customers take one them, still people walking without mask employees nothing attempt enforce it. Yep. poor air quality today Vancouver. reference love Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch fact can't get lol comment hardly considered truth it. Unfortunately, case everywhere. new cases Europe 18-25 demographic lot infections traced back universities. time, ‚Äúself regulation‚Äù kicking people certain age risk profile continuing careful. Hence, increase number cases, death rate remains low (for now) Done. 

Is reference standup bit? honest masks compulsory everywhere. Correct I‚Äôm wrong BC still allowed gatherings 50 people? Uk banned 6 people present we‚Äôre one except family. pro active reactive that‚Äôs trying say, otherwise might get stage get many cases can‚Äôt contact trace thought reading headline. But:

""The study found positive negative cases reported going gyms, hair salons, shops in-home group gatherings rate. positive cases twice likely report dining restaurants within 14-day period feeling sick."" experience average American restaurant air conditioned point feeling like meat processing facility know virus loves conditions. Welcome tp fun allowed kids! spend break watching tv like goody goody. There's construction going outside house whole time (this degree excitement I've lately) cops there, right next construction workers, tearing road dust flying everywhere... none wearing masks. really trying prove point wear mask circumstances NORMAL to. think test actually properly sensitive, like Ct order 30, WAY fewer deaths ascribed covid? say exact US   seemed like taking seriously.

You go rev.com read scripts shows. glorious.  unemployed person skills web cam   suppose influence steal die prematurely?  Good luck!  Take covid PCR test, way check truly virus. guess jealous see youtube videos around Toronto last months one really wearing masks except store employees.  Maybe tune changed bit.

Messages, calls video calls lovely, dammit want boyfriend here.   understand science based making theories predictive power? 

We theories immune system body works. Even brand new virus never infected human before. science predict happen body. 

Most pretty obvious. finding confirming theories, also good critical part science. Maybe specific finding obvious, symptoms, transmission, immunity overall pretty obvious. 

During like black death, people even know disease transmitted causing it. Today knew airway infection, probably caused bacteria virus, later confirmed virus, knew likely spread droplets, maybe aerosol. Yeah right.... Well starters think irrelevant coronavirus sub stinks whataboutism. But

Tiananmen terrible shame hundred people lost thier lives. know people students Beijing time. also shame people like focus tiananmen, trouble country. Also know long time ago.

Your entire thread fails point one single reason hospital beds full used be. entire post fails mention Cape Town closed main field hospital lack patients. 

Why people still getting physically sicks rates used to? hospital beds packed anymore? Even zero testing done, people still get sick. 

Junk post. Thank you. I‚Äôm fine right going quarantine. fortunate young otherwise healthy hopefully things go ok hope gets fined big time. 

Can hope Trump making fool free German prison Thats critical thinking works. border closures, full lockdowns, wide-spread testing associated COVID-19 mortality per million impending famine pushing projected **265 million people** starvation result measures (less aid, disrupted supply chains, economic crises, etc.) ethical duty question blinkered measures.

But China cases (if trust China's numbers). rushing untested vaccine case? make sense add up. lot people living conditions really difficult stop spread. also really well now. Meanwhile, USA everything could spread virus. 

The reason lot empathy India because, even everything could stop spread, huge outbreaks bound happen. 

With said, feel bad whole planet, I'm especially feeling sorry India right now. undeserved suffering large scale. Michigan here. 1300 yesterday. Gotta pump numbers baby! WOO feel way Hillary prosecuted? doubt it. Yes, note, didn‚Äôt say people would home. people indoors. That‚Äôs difference - shutdown meant stay home don‚Äôt see others. People aren‚Äôt going back shutdown, even NY. They‚Äôre going going movies, shopping malls, restaurants, etc indoors whereas mild weather might choose spend time outside instead. Remember ""Breaking News"" meant ""listen up, important shit happening""? Now, Joe Biden hangnail might well qualify.

Which inevitable outcome a) conflating news entertainment b) requiring ""fresh content"" 24 hours day, *every* day Quebec? great idea. dumb enough go cruise right now, likely end getting COVID anyway. might well sea away general population.

But like NC universities (at least larger public ones) operating normally. In-person classes happening.

It may right move, #1 priority curtail spread virus throughout communities. lower rate spread among students less likely off-campus establishes &amp; businesses disrupted.

I would get takeout remove package put plates wash hands. Refused let family touch anything plated. 

The virus must get lungs. nasal passages. zero way get GI tract respiratory system. 

Currently evidence transmission FOOD. 

It simply food bourne:  

Viruses spread food. Ever. None do. Bacteria does.  

I would never make shit like this. Seriously spent hours upon hours Googling shit.

And finally. I'm living proof bro/sis. I've eaten restaurants lately, sure... amount delivery takeout I've eaten since shit started restaurants opened would absolutely blow fucking mind. damn near embarrassing. we've done ok financially whole bullshit, like eat want help local restaurants. possible get sick eating food there's possible way could lucky.  
That's found 5 minutes Googling. Spend hours like did. 
Not making up.  

Order food, friend. amount international travel / business UK NZ worlds apart though. UK also much porous border EU. Iceland probably comparable.

Really, ad hominems already?  Honestly means either kid will. Still better masks all. I'm Australia follow US news. There's definitely psychology behind though. Outside familiar settings strangers around (and reminders posters, masks etc) people likely cautious follow safety protocols. familiar locations know well likely zero visual safety reminders, people relax likely forget / less inclined take precautionary measures. vote get rid mods?

Victoria roughly population Florida.

Victoria roughly 721 new cases 2 days stage 4 lockdown &lt;in announced. little month dropped 39.

Florida 617 new cases june 2.

Victoria 19,767 total cases 710 deaths. 

Florida 657,373 total cases 12501 deaths.

EDIT: Australia figures inside virus could've easily prevented ever entering country, that's biggest travesty. people decide themselves. COVID makes fear life, stay inside. Like anything else, protect government piss poor job protecting anybody. government's job command citizens anything, matter beneficial think would be. Look Sweden, country done fuck-all prevent corona. deaths per capita comparable US, absolutely screw small businesses bought new mega corporate overlords. conclusion: whatever fuck want. virus force nature, without vaccine, there's little stop country personal freedom sort priority. Stop apologist stupid! mean exactly said, please vote. don‚Äôt care side aisle you‚Äôre on. someone tells vote vote - aren‚Äôt pro-democracy.

There also good chance people could become asymptomatic carriers first infection, one want make sure spreading it. Mmm. Generally. family... home?

I‚Äôm slowly starting believe Reddit love hysteria panic don‚Äôt want end. freaks much slightly worse flu? Yep. It‚Äôs early tell. happened 3 days ago, wouldn‚Äôt even know infected yet(I‚Äôd encourage get tested). don‚Äôt know interact them, I‚Äôm safe now. they‚Äôre confirmed positive I‚Äôm getting testing sure, knows, may interacted someone *do* interact with. deadly viruses tend kill host quicker thus less time spread, tend burn out. least that‚Äôs I‚Äôve gathered sub. Merci beaucoup! :) going restaurants entire pandemic. enjoy want support local businesses without handouts. I‚Äôve caught covid 16 times died 3 times already. really don‚Äôt want this. worst pandemic history originated Kentucky WW1 killing 51 million. 1.75 billion planet time. r/commentsyoucanhear Capitalists spent hundreds millions dollars fostering disbelief climate change avoid taking responsibility part causing it.

Hence, ventilator crisis supposed happen never did, hospitals reduced usage. Dude I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs flat wrong. Gilead‚Äôs stock marginal .92% YTD right now. Earlier year hyped ‚Äúmiracle drug‚Äù still rather conservative 20% considering thought time. aside marginal amount people likely sold time (and google SEC filings insider trading documents confirm aside regular selling nothing unusual happened) investors large benefit this. Heck Walmart 15% YTD arguably they‚Äôve benefited Gilead has. smart thing do. Taiwan banned China firm beginning they‚Äôre best performing country Coronavirus. Canada isn‚Äôt. Learn country that‚Äôs handling best way. Data don‚Äôt lie. Omg, first let ypu know girl idiot recomended watching crap movie. Normal Serbs outraged director actually could name movie Serbian Film first place. Maybe start telling actually aproved government stupidly misconnected crap. awful, plain stupid. never watched it, none people know.

Anyway, coruption, lies false information waaay worse there, trust me, idiots would trust Trump. 3 Fauci's politically placed pupets. thing comforts boters trust them, could solve problem long run. count survive next 2 years, might chance decent life 30 years. used dying, remember wars? So, maybe get shit sort cruel IQ test corona might be. happen, likely year two away. Fauci's estimate bad one. Well depends interpret excess deaths data. 

Sweden excess deaths June 3k. past two months excess deaths -700. 

If trend continues end year excess deaths sweden statistically different year. 

I‚Äôm awaiting see thing occurs US albeit play much slower due country population size.

I note excess deaths recently turned negative US. surprise. guessed posted pool party photos. first rounds vaccines probably effective enough bring severity seasonal flu. Pssh, Trumps already tested Oregon last month. Well theoretically flattening curve allow aggressive effective government response. wasn‚Äôt. doesn‚Äôt look like going one January lucky. 

Until people living lives inevitable reopening schools. matters keeping low possible. Live ON, said better myself. Feeling pain...just cool weather fall patio season over, also lot mental health issues 6 months locked inside snowy ass winter. 6 months already working home I'm feeling heavy already. Also, economic impact cannot ignored. many amazing restaurants shops people's livelihood closing CERB employer benefit payments government begin cease. so? It‚Äôs est get tested. friend mild symptoms. Got free test cleared leave isolation 7 days negative test. March would never tested. numbers show things way better control. We're glad you, welcome home!

Heureux de t'avoir, bienvenue √† la maison!  lot establishments still require masks worn even vaccine distribution, unless you‚Äôre one assholes doesn‚Äôt follow directions.  idea preventing hospitals overwhelmed always shortsighted. never good plan. people foolish enough believe short pause would fix things mean ever good plan. 

The countries success virus financially mostly used aggressive containment strategies. 

This never turned anything. lied back March, ate up. community spread curbed rates like we're seeing Northeast example, inherent risk involved life without masks/social distancing. I‚Äôm going back Montreal tomorrow (visiting family here) holy hell, everyone gives anxiety Toronto. Hanging mask nose wearing mask. mention, see least 5 people wearing masks TTC. 

Quebec starting fine people wearing masks starting tomorrow. wait.   Numbers corrected spread days actually tested. Looks like decreasing again. great news. don‚Äôt even know purpose vaccine (does provide immunity? lessen symptoms) effective let‚Äôs take day day instead going doom glom, dystopian, last 50 years scenario. scenarios depending effectiveness purpose vaccine could get flu levels mid late 2021 according educated epidemiologists. hospitalizations deaths decreasing, there‚Äôs point mass mask wearing. Bro wish knew. Great minds! ditto. Spears? almost like one traveling right now.

Maybe someone mention people run countries. Depending (don't want America-centric) R0 may already 1 cases may already falling off. Numbers corrected substantially. number cases actually decreasing again. 100% case me. moved January 2016 election happened. definitely grateful know dodged several bullets staying states. feel safer taken care country ever US, dont plan ever going back. anyone wants collect links. I'm political, tired work....  Looks like numbers corrected down. way Spain reports really confusing. ......CZ Czech Republic know applicable current situation previous research comparing medical outcomes US Canada, one factor Americans tended delay seeking medical attention (due cost considerations) thus worse outcomes similar conditions. scientists sugarcoat negative result. Find useless positive points fucking paper could get published instead thrown trashcan. get EUAs professionals know useless buying it. That's what's happening. Viruses known trigger autoimmune diseases. even 'just another virus,' fact highly contagious, humans immunity it, leaves far people susceptible possibility.  Most? mean U.S. majority post mindless rambling.

You never actually said would end pandemic. ""Close borders early"" ""Locked regions down"" real suggestions one mitigation strategy plausible.

Sorry gave many actual problems address gave non-response. happening right now? OK lobster think they‚Äôre referring specifically eating restaurants, cos article mentions study doesn‚Äôt distinguish indoor outdoor seating. think there‚Äôs one way go, we‚Äôll see happens. Lots close contact.

It's rubbish. think must know really meant that, right? really think meant people need get sick hospitals profitable? think pointing fact masks work cover breathing-orifices ""covid superiority""?

Do think knowing count numbers superiority? know state capitols geographic superiority?

Whether tragedy change fact *if fiancee wore mask like time* (i.e. covering nose) likely family properly protecting virus puts increased risk getting virus *and* makes likely get severe version it.

Did deserve die? Abso-fucking-lutely not. Neither people fiancee coming contact breathes potential infection onto them.

One thing true (this sad unfair) another thing also true (that useful way wear mask) pretending otherwise childish.

You idea circumstance surrounds it. Interesting, sheer curiosity, States cop see medical history checking ID? God insufferable cunt safety everyone else‚Äôs, really get mask fits. young people love drugs, sex, partying, exacerbating. Exacerbation runs rampant college students. India also hardest hit country Spanish flu. Yup, sure do.

Pretty incredible people still point anyone talking balance devastating impacts impossible trade they‚Äôre crazy grandma killers m. there‚Äôs nothing shelter place open every night club up. 

Would gladly taken proper, coordinated lockdown response, twice looking back course. since didn‚Äôt happen isn‚Äôt going happen, let‚Äôs talk actual mitigate deaths destroy lives so... flatten, slow, wear damn mask Walmart find way live. Omg shenanigans going country? spirit created country also downfall. fine line independence selfishness. That's generous.

Covid deadly, I'm talking airborne Ebola strains, things like that. would screwed. Resurrection! joke, people seeing someone contribute problem article that's supposed elicit sympathy person.

It tragedy woman lost fiance, one right mind would deny that.

But mask slips talk, maybe get one actually fits face, spend $5 mask nose clip instead $3 piece crap. life everyone else's around depends it, stop trying pass bare minimum like acting responsibly. Yet corporate America stops caring people‚Äôs health minute profits start dropping  everyone working home ""rich."" Fortunate enough able work home, sure. working home better part 5 years, barely head water. anyone know coronavirus response Biden planning take election? basically to, regardless pandemic, people deserve see loved ones .

Best part work put quarantine someone tested positive... Totally surprised!  It‚Äôs government jobs require part membership. family living 1 relative medical profession (have visited many times). I‚Äôm willing provide proof that, it‚Äôs random internet person‚Äôs word. feels like think could eradicated virus, or

It feels like think persuade people *anyone* imagined could *eradicate* virus. that's really weird thinking part part whomever put trying it. People care. should. don't.  don‚Äôt know. What‚Äôs happening now? giving food, water, shelter? whole thing source despair every day get live relatively privileged, comfy life suffer horribly... it‚Äôs crushing. I'm convinced desantis trying achieve herd immunity yeah couple decided hold big ole gender reveal party used incendiary device sky orange. cthulhu! k lives NYC nice say parents debt maintaining lifestyle her. new teachers salary confirms it, staying inside Yeah personal risk getting bad case COVID dying extremely low given age, I'm bothered catching per se, I'm bothered moment passing on. However, vaccine that's say 75% build herd immunity, happen anti-vaxxers, I'm willing lay blame anyone dies COVID 100% feet take absolutely responsibility (once time comes could reasonably expect enough people vaccine) anyone getting infected. Sweden thing. anyone could Sweden, find difficult compare Sweden US especially regarding health outcomes mortality. 

It's just... even close. like comparing northern California Mississippi, all.  obviously don‚Äôt asked, asshole. know even basic thing vaccines, would know pass system fairly quickly linger around 20-30 years later. Looks like got karma too.

That people disagree CCP shady fuck leaves aghast. decommissioned navy, you‚Äôre aloud talk Umm....because it‚Äôs new account? Gotta careful statements don‚Äôt obvious sarcasm them. Looking comment history seems like you‚Äôre telling truth tho. amazing doctors researchers ever considered this!

Excuse me, go nominate Nobel Prize.

EDIT: seriously, person assumes nobody thought giving patients earlier before? person knows better experts? looked (is really surprising?) It‚Äôs done deal yet. all
Have vote Orange Dick-tater out. like trump predicted, much winning i'm tired mask ... get brigaded lol  imagine moron think total deaths needs adjusted population growth time... fucking reddit. This

Is

The

Way said I'll give months. based premise article enough people take vaccine reason measures still needed. Subscribed Ah, see. initially said ‚Äúthe least amount restrictions US state‚Äù baffled. America, ‚ÄúMy Freedom Liberty!‚Äù Isn‚Äôt compatible selfless part society crisis. OP wants stir shit post. totally disingenuous trying make sound like going forever make us give stop trying. types posts coming more, trying give us sense despair resignation. sound like someone cares US people.

We give up. ever. Republicans. trump, republicans complicit actions presidency makes feel better? get comment.  
I walk restaurant masked. sit table 6-8 feet away people. Hell, tonight put us basically room. glorious. 12 tables 5,000 sq ft restaurant. 6 feet apart, 10 feet apart. put us side room usually gets reserved parties.  
But want judge even stepped foot restaurant. That's bothers me. know well restaurants handling things. sit home judge. many people live afraid go restaurants they're EMPTY. safe tonight. server safe. Dinner great. promise one got Covid tonight.  
You really consider trying depending live. Work customer service day quickly find managers exist lick shitty asshole clean every Karen lest *gasp* call corporate. Wait hold what?? hear Compare measles outbreak U.S. year before. Almost nightly first story network nightly news. Guess what? end, single US child adult died outbreak. Enter Covid-19 within 6 months 195,000 americans dead, reach milestone numbers major media bother tell us death count. Where's over-reaction?? worry, article says thing really need right agree one continue funding government 9-30. So, ya know, argue instead help American people. toss guy couple lit California fire gender reveal party.  even national guideline let alone mandate say was.

The point nation far less restrictions US State virus fading away. Naturally. magic. Sweden vaccine. case spell.

It burns out. makes people sick. People die idea goes forever utter shit. ok, yes. actually fucking dumb. Thats called fascism  I'll bet spelling words correctly considered odd standing You‚Äôre depressed? I‚Äôm fucking depressed I‚Äôm fucking done bullshit!! wow new cases graph Spain amazingly symmetrical 

Thanks lot think know reinfection Exact thing happened recently. Like literally exactly every detail. It‚Äôs infuriating. aren‚Äôt content stupid, noooo! follow cliff. number cases equal number infections, two different numbers. Using amount cases calculate death rates first horribly inaccurate (your 6% vs commonly estimated 0.4-0.6%), second impossible compare countries since countries tested amount people per capita middle ground then, back normal matter tired virus? Ya sucks, sit tight quit bitching Overall state well reducing numbers, move understandable.. confirmed case meaningless term, making data worthless. Eh, Sweden isn‚Äôt state US...  y'all know express empathy shows. absolutely problem staying sane home. people need get grip. don‚Äôt see assert that. tracker looking says around 6.5 million positive tests US, know undercount. let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs WAY undercounted. Let‚Äôs say real number 10x that. 65 million positive cases. 

The current US population around 330 million. means, 10x number real positive cases tested, around 19% population infected. 

This Mayo Clinic study says would need around 70% reach herd immunity. wouldn‚Äôt even third way there. Unless suspect real case numbers 100-150 million mortality rate substantially lower reported, don‚Äôt see come conclusion. (230 million would needed herd immunity, 5% mortality rate would 10million+ We‚Äôll likely never know. Abolish ICE, reorganize rest DHS departments. cannot seriously fucking dumb. y‚Äôall surprised? huge amount people cramming tight spaces encouraged isn‚Äôt exactly best Staff-to-staff spread seems highest likelihood, staff-to-student student-to-family, student-to-student. 

It‚Äôs hard Americans believe, countries intrusive contact tracing, anecdotal evidence always supported this. Singapore March, preschool principal spread virus 15 staff members, single kid facility family members (all home-quarantined) turned sick.   Winter coming! know man... usually try. Maybe I'm still hoping people wake fucking delusional bipartisan hate election going end pandemic. still neck deep first wave September. virus give shit elections. Wait viable vaccine better safety precautions actually taken seriously. Exactly hope Nobody afford Whole Foods now. They'll hide statistics. apparent they've corrupt years. Lots casualties! even expressed numbers clear manner, numbers present still establish causality even correlation. Perhaps 66% population eating begin effect many people get covid. Maybe try wearing mask correctly  I'd also like add that, also got big, fair share mask denying idiots around here, germans tend wear masks take social distancing seriously less disciplined it. huge family parties time, even though huuuge family gatherings lots hugging german thing begin with. guess general populace prefers go clubs bars kinds fests, still mostly closed happen outside. true Los Angeles many parts US.

Free testing even zero symptoms Allow retort list;

* Nothing climate change. Hurricans happen. #Wearethevirus
* antifa arson fires, like Australia beginning year
* *2019, ftfy 
* Remember Glaicer National Park take [Climate sign? do. yeah, want vulnerable close immune shelter, vulnerable risk maximum amount time! Let's CoNtRoL virus. think you‚Äôre match Jedi snark. bit racist, Germans adhere stereotype. Cant wait take Mitch McConnell going something it? Fat fucking chance. huge red flag move Arkansas though.   run risk trapped ship without able disembark months like ships back March. much different? Enough warrant mass hysteria cancel entire college football seasons? talking important remember 10 second race, ongoing marathon.

Sweden went Top 5 deaths per million Top 11. time pandemic over, might well Top 50 Top 100. know yet.

Lockdowns buy time, yes. time wasted (Peru, Belgium, UK, USA, Ecuador, Spain, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Italy) lockdown pointless since many people still die future waves + crippled mental health well livelihood population. I'm terribly biased (since that's bread butter), big unpopular opinion Excel humanity's greatest achievement past century. person alive knows understands every single feature, command, function. There's always something new, like bottomless ocean nerdvana. :)

It's amazing many different things set data, columns rows numbers. Personally, enjoy creating tools tell story plain English based happened day before. requires finagling, end result awesome haha needs ‚ÄúCovid Quilt‚Äù teachers üò£

 ... along substantial, unmissable memorial DC names. No. haven‚Äôt even said officially happened. could say something like ‚ÄúIn course trial one participants initially diagnosed transverse myelitis. mild case patient released hospital full recovery expected. investigation concluded related participation trial.‚Äù 

That fully anonymous line reporting goes clinical trials. 

Saying something like ‚Äú42 year old women Kent earlier hospitalized‚Äù still doesn‚Äôt violate medical anonymity it‚Äôs starting walk line doesn‚Äôt offer anything additional first paragraph does. could even include age location relevant. made laugh personally find annoying enough probably go theater wear mask.

I'm saying I'm anti-masker, wear mask need go public building, find going event wear mask fun. Never seen knock athlete entire season, happened MLB. also done eating? 'Only' dual citizens. Fauci, understand trusting him, others, do. totally fine! long actually mean isolated, need groceries wear mask, use sanitizer, follow directions. 

Best case would fully prepared stay isolated get (arrive groceries supplies), like, camp forest something. (And pack put pack in/leave trace!)

We lots super beautiful places totally safely explore socially distance time. free-camping right!

Some isolated popular places don‚Äôt medical infrastructure support number visitors getting, people camping EVERYWHERE, paying stay campground (which honestly would fine with) buuut leaving literal human shit garbage everywhere, little ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù free-campers sprung social distancing place, personal hygiene either, zero respect environment community. drug overdoses small towns‚Äô single ambulance go respond (putting first responders risk, well leaving town ambulance time). often come town supplies en masse, rarely compliance store regulations masks sanitizing group numbers.

And every year (because kind thing happens time popular destinations) locals go every year host major clean forest much garbage left behind.  following Ontario conferences last days, honest. happening makes say that? anything school opening? Gosh darn dem big pharma companies using tens hundreds millions dollars make vaccine virus safe millions lives, always wanting make hundreds millions dollars lost profit creating vaccine gosh darn actually realising zero reason make vaccine hurt kill people get zero reason try make tracking chip small enough much easier track peoples phones Damn, know. I've bingeing episode that. try remember fan Canada good them, got better control shit USA. Wait she‚Äôs RN US, would‚Äôve taken NCLEX anyways she‚Äôs qualified work BC. problem BCCNP letting in? that‚Äôs stupid probably mostly BC thing due trying keep bunch people moving province. Hopefully gets sorted guys soon! test way Quebec past weeks. like 26k tests yesterday. positive rate less 1%. Bold assume people wearing masks moral values Fauci really realistic views.

Just like 'you wear goggles' advice.

Sure might work, nobody practice. need hit body tremendous ultraviolet light. doubt still many phase three trials starting late September/October Oxford vaccine Would necessary double blind enough participants UK trial, given level scrutiny?

Also, degree looking effectiveness degree looking human safety? Well... okay now, imo

(With covid, is. Ford gutted province general) Hey whatever makes headlines. ""Sorry grandma, gonna die anyway, goddamn it, *have* party."" kidding. Covid win it! See guys, old decrepit people already deathbed dieing Covid-19. need people able enjoy last 15 years lives. /S Well I‚Äôm woman guess I‚Äôll wank gal. Lol. thread‚Äôs getting deleted sure.  Dual citizens,

Essential workers (incl. military related),

Residents,

Spouses children locals (with without dual citizenship).

There's lots reasons allow Americans places. recreationally. different places. Doesn‚Äôt make logical make comparisons long term damage COVID SARS look NY Sweden they've seen precipitous drop cases despite similar lockdown behaviors vs places seen massive rises, effect acquired immunity likely significantly higher antibody testing reflects.

Your point peoples risk assessment changing low efficacy vaccine right though. suspect much less faith lockdown efforts you. us would much like give citizenship, leave, start quiet life somewhere else, good citizen value shared community.

On behalf country, I'm sorry. College students mostly following guidelines fine freedom fighters Sure.  Sadly lot measures people take performative. seems important people FEEL like safe actually safe. restaurants may signs clean things enforce rules actually care employees testing positive. even normal anymore? Oh screwed difference numbers close, course. There‚Äôs cases we‚Äôre aware gray area. Wank party!!!!!! Sorry, resist.

I guess gone, now. Thanks Fauci....

Man guy really spearheading whole thing. He‚Äôs become announcer football game. It‚Äôs money. Bar/restaurant owners gotta pay bills too. free handouts life. I‚Äôd find loophole meant providing family. options?  Virus like honey badger fly never needs sleep. Getting back normal pipe dream. Sorry looks little spammy hosting chart website, ads popups -- higher quality version image. find way post original content Coronavirus news (via text image upload), something finished making. data seen before, think tells unique story pandemic seen sleep patterns. preferred model months, they're oissed longer underestimating deaths. early enough apparently ü•± advised wearing face mask, Asian countries clearly ignored lmao. Nah, Canada nice that. clickbait headlines that. Fines go $750K I've read $1K so. beginning whole thing, back way uncertain, asked doc Vitamin D. saying gets construction workers, know, tanned people 8 hours sun, still need supplement it. know you‚Äôre hick 226 city size density Tokyo remarkably low looked extensive poll linked couldn‚Äôt find data specific question like while. I'll never forget one time kid, working truck stop southern Ontario. American family stopped skiis roof wondering snow was...in July.  saying 100k assume biggest problem schools opening people thinking parties Keep thread get copyright claimed pilot study involving compulsory face masks several busy parts Amsterdam Rotterdam shows use masks lead change behaviour, reduction visitor numbers, researchers said Friday...Shopkeepers complained sales 40% areas masks compulsory.Rotterdam Amsterdam given go-ahead introduce facemasks busy areas national government early August coronavirus infection numbers spiked, see effect distancing public awareness.The RIVM public health institute never supported use non-medical face masks government instead emphasised importance limiting visitors home keeping 1.5 metres distance.

TL;DR Face mask ordinances scare away potential customers. Oh, I'm US. Sorry probably mentioned that. Poor people ride bus restaurant jobs laugh nervously. Hes making fun fat people think point.

Was decent amount summer I'm hoping enough bring levels again. ... gf? Thanks! Canada's immigration policy makes much sense policy back US, understand. coworkers moved States 10 years ago still gotten citizenship even PR.

Canada's system, faster PR citizenship timelines, much better. theoretically possible become citizen within 5-6 years moving here.

Fully speculating here. causes end then? happened Sweden New York? overall mortality back normal? ""missing diet"". lol.

The main source vit sun exposure. minuscule amounts vit food sources. *If* people take precautions...

The US still learned lesson. ton places dropping social distancing guidelines, opening bars restaurants returning life general C19. 

Oh no, really time Stupid Show. first act America pledges allegiance idiocy, second act America justifies idiocy ignorance third act America pretends none ever happened. show immediately followed encore performance ad infinium. read graphs, US nowhere close EU. Canada here. I‚Äôm keeping borders closed Americans permanently! That's great long OK clearing deadwood approach pandemic response. upside improves cost Healthcare everyone got rid elderly infirmed, downside lost grandparents. Sweden top 15 deaths per million could done better. 

I however agree lock downs temporary give us time develop response new contagion. used locally help outbreaks. But, many governments squandered time petty bickering mixed messages severity threat getting infrastructure place would allow us return semi-formal levels activity. actually study people dosed (the product liver something produces actually) better admission rates outcomes, recall specifics, came shortly think study referencing. asking disprove negative? that? No, sorry, case I'm afraid call is; see complete lack moral fibre, I'll call that. NOTHING feeling 'superior' not. I'm done calling assholes they're assholes. want get called sociopath moral values? act like sociopath moral values? time pussyfooting around sociopaths long gone.   comment meant happening England though specified. American: Yes that's referring  absolutely say stuff case trials SAEs time. they‚Äôre choosing beyond me. who? seen anywhere point since started really. SJW cultists probably celebrating this. Quote it! Prove said something mail voting. claim commented several times. Pick one show me. can‚Äôt quote didn‚Äôt find makes liar. assume stuff people argue assumptions. It‚Äôs kinda sad needy conflict. 

How prove point? even point anymore? thought talking think know medical experts. Yea - there's ton selfish people world, agnostic nationality demographic characteristic

What exacerbates destructive nature media (including social media) - propaganda pushed constantly paints alternate reality, demonizes others agree you, pushes people ideological echo chambers reinforce build people's negative beliefs actions

I used laissez faire terms government's role society, year feel like govt. needs crack hard would disrupt society crisis like this. Greeks calculated curvature earth 3rd century BC. watch ship ""hull down"" near horizon. vaccine trials young children? thank dealing misinformation I‚Äôm sorry hear body repairs time ? new scientific break through?   United States given trying control let many die need be. population notion day hundreds millions doses vaccine made available everyone get free solved without anyone put hard work. fine dandy long affecting you, right?  rally Michigan showed there‚Äôs still tons denial...denial isn‚Äôt right word. Stupidity...that‚Äôs it...major stupidity. means many residents community sickened died, high price pay herd immunity. experts like Dr. Hanage cautioned even community may reached herd immunity cannot afford complacent.

Not worth it. Probably bad idea feelings ""there electors"" read article assumed living together. No. video clearly letting anyone walking come party. agree that's...too stupid words. can't fix stupid black teeth? brushing, boot looking, combination both? kidding, never brushed teeth. Chile proposed innovative approach COVID, actually similar happened states level. TG Chile aborted it. completely agree you.  Unfortunately elections arent decided intelligent people like yourself.  seems like elections controled uneducated... know nyc restaurants filed lawsuit state. find hard believe owners voting democrat.  arent sueing white house...

I freaking hope im wrong want guy bad faith going happen Imagine war half nation attack rest threat president tells state handle plan reduce threat. government protect nation whole. major purpose central government all. Balance power important time place central power needed. cohesive national strategy necessary time war global health crisis major disaster. Imagine trying mobilize troops every state troops sent individually bargaining signing contracts government agencies first. even poverty : lots people decent incomes working home need send kids kind daycare cannot work home supervise young child school time. risk losing job. Uh. You‚Äôll look operation warp speed...that‚Äôs for. probably type names vaccines search bar they‚Äôll come up. mom wife trusted mostly reserved capacity. understand trusted me... feel number electors based state population includes illegal aliens? fascist people already call it. moreover, premise incorrect. Reasonable people wearing masks, self-isolating, social distancing stick president. We're wearing masks stuff experts saying best we've got handle virus. That's difference reasonable people president: him, cruelty point. investigations protests - impeachment- grudge spite, guy actively working interests regular people treating federal government like personal slush fund. protests behavior, *him*. impeached small part highly inappropriate phone call. president's base treated masks sign patriotism instead opposite, might crossed 100k total ~200k national strategy, 6 months since *national* emergency declared. See, CAN. don‚Äôt.  hope live see day Facebook burns fuckin ground lot worthless data, stop FOX news spreading data like. ain‚Äôt special can‚Äôt tell far people apart photo. It‚Äôs long, low shot effect flattening Source please? I've said before, u.s never gonna get better. late, many idiots government care. There's noth much except sane people take seriously try follow guidelines.  Cases falling weeks now. world guy living in, I'm living reality.

Someone needs sack Fauci. guy spreads fear mongering everyday. ever prediction made wrong. People like aren‚Äôt playing stupid, are. American, I‚Äôm reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally hoping fellow countrymen aren‚Äôt stupid fear are. track record isn‚Äôt great. 

4 months ago said vaccine 18-24 months would miracle, 3 months ago said mask mandates wouldn‚Äôt last past Memorial Day. mean, it‚Äôs fine wrong, time. pushing something virulently demonstrably wrong multiple times, especially regards health issue, seems dangerous. 

Look, don‚Äôt know shit virology, I‚Äôm trying synthesize read reputable doctors, government policy, human behavior make sense. claims seem extraordinary compared evidence reputable sources don‚Äôt seem backed anything assertions. 

For instance, Mayo Clinic article says NOTHING vaccines. quote fact says 70% would need get sick recover-


‚ÄúEven infection COVID-19 virus creates long-lasting immunity, large number people would become infected reach herd immunity threshold. Experts estimate U.S., 70% population ‚Äî 200 million people ‚Äî would recover COVID-19 halt epidemic.‚Äù 

And 5% mortality might high (maybe it‚Äôs 2-4% real total infection numbers) claiming 1/10 requires form evidence. hate even seeing motherfucker's name 99% time, dictatorial streak over-estimates power. he‚Äôs finally supposed take charge, he‚Äôs impotent MIA.‚Äù US probably already close 20% already infected. state currently virus control mean irresponsibility can't reignite pandemic. Fuck off, dipshit. 4 years supposed max institute husband got PhD. got really lucky selected research assistant dean college (I joked ""fetch boy"" since mostly entailed grunt work) got another 3 years it. 7th year warned going cut off, better wrap dissertation fast.

Humanities PhDs involve long research projects years data gathering like often run clock assistanceships. don‚Äôt see assert that.

You're right. know he's talking about. 

He assert away, thinking place among knowledge situation. Wow, that's really awful. wonder many stories kept quiet. district we've 2 cases in-person students starts Monday, dozen teachers fearing covid retired. 

&amp; biggie never expected downvote saying TX teachers resource report unsafe conditions. There's troll midst. Well doctor, patients collegues getting better. Lots cases chronic shortness breath, fatigue, chest pains otherwise healthy young people. Lots neurologic changes too. Loss taste smell coming back. things worse....chronic organ damage, irreversible changes.
The facebook mom leader person there. 
Take seriously. touch hands? Here‚Äôs good article  idea Yup, 700 new infections reported today we'd 400 - 500 long time. Ontario Quebec 200 cases today BC's looking great either.  Cool take measures help go completely back normal decided time enough? Yah everyone gets Chinese cough automatically die  mask goes nose, too. Idiot. Yeah, go casino. Makes sense. Goddammit. course Ohio. sure mean inflated. logical test cases find confirm?

Politics art turning event matter position advantage. logical upcoming elections USA democrats republicans try use demonstrates wrong side appeal voters hopefully win votes?

Numbers need manipulated themselves, enough modify way present much talk specific interpretation them.  American brain mask, come stay whole thing blows over? I'd argue they're worth considering family that. fact isn‚Äôt tagged ‚ÄúGood News‚Äù tells everything need know sub. Poor Fauci. Maybe lied everyone value masks right ripe pretend hoax. belief spread easily prominent figure espouses publicly. Worst death rate right now? 1200 deaths day per 1 billion lot less 1000 death day 340 million. Deaths probably undercounted everywhere know real counts excess deaths calculated cdc said groups 10 much protests 1000 ok, thing over. one fence going accept straight face. Pope Catholic know article discusses rides, I‚Äôm referring photo posted start thread. got sooooo much shit July said US outbreak would start decline August.  money.

There's way could ""call peak"" without history confirm solid trend downward stay down. Look Spain (and others Europe). decline face another wave.

You deservedly caught shit people correctly sensed can't possible know happen next 6 12 months. Crohn's disease suppressed immune system, yet dad still felt necessary post meme mask wearers 'pussies'. 

Everything fucked. Wait, call ""A Game Changer.""

Am allowed hopeful absence clickbait headline?

Because I'm kinda hopeful. Homeland security pc naming ""secret police""  Yeah really arbitrary date... unless... Mods R/covid19 going get pissed Good you. us don‚Äôt want hide home forever. We‚Äôve got jobs families take care watch video party letting strangers roam house. 

What supposed do? actually fucking quarantining letting randos frat house. 

I hope kids get expelled. They‚Äôre dumb college anyway. ankles, try hard. Go play video game. wondered too. mean fuck guys HIPPA?  Half content sub moaning Trump, can‚Äôt call Netanyahu?

Good job. seems like US needs new corona spokesman. He‚Äôs cutting say -

Being Texan sucks. right? wanna know. XD need shut everything. ""Essential Services"" still run efficiently lock down. 

Almost every country except US able this. 

Canada locked everything except essential services month (restaurants bars two months), drastically reduced effect COVID more-or-less back normal (except everyone wearing face masks). Canada, poor are, even managed give $2000 month 7 months(!) everyone lost income COVID.

If US Canada would bounced back less economic impact, deaths would easily 10 times less. Cool story bro Cue Miley spiking rural areas dodged first wave. Typical trump move...deflect someone‚Äôs actions years ago never even president Cut heart pieces! NZ Island,dude,much easier control spread.

/s hard know people gotten sick died - people dont give fuck others cause, idea?  curve capacity health case system? aggregate, probably 100k people vaccine trials moment. number possible serious adverse events actually absurdly low. saved 2 million lives(let‚Äôs say 1.9 hit 300k deaths) year due lockdowns. Yeah right. One local restaurants upped prices bit tacked take fee. I'm ok that. I'm going go support them, though. 

I hate say it, best businesses going need pivot survive. purely political.. fuck sake algorithm trasg Gasp. God forbid make everyone wear n95s too. Here‚Äôs guideline: Stay fuck home! Im sure meant haha Oh well wonder excess death toll Brazil is. many Latin American countries 2-5 times official deaths, higher first world country. CANADA #1 WOOOHOO ! sure, also speak french poutine ! like got downvoted right,lol 

Salty americans gonna stay salty guess Read action government individuals** slow spread coronavirus suppress new cases, 2.2 million people United States could die.

Think says. Really think. 9/11 worth deaths every 3-4 weeks Florida alone people scoff off, bizarre. Since July? Really? long way go...  Swedes admitted failure protecting elderly. Protecting vulnerable one reasons lockdown many countries. 

But yeah, looks like younger people actually faced establishing herd immunity. bet reddit pissed slowly becomes clear young people essentially boomers. outdoor dining support like served dishes ha.
I hate take away packaging ends house. 
I concerns gift cards cold falls winters (Ma) worry small local places love even survive winter I‚Äôll left useless gift card?

So outdoor dine like week local places love hope get heaters outdoor least fall winter it‚Äôs 25-30f. wear coat means local places survive this.  put value research 

I seen evidence contrary vaccine effort. Went back school Thursday. first case Friday. knew gonna happen seeing chaos halls weird way kind amusing. could say ""did yall see coming??"" Hopefully makes school respect little ""The 86-patient preliminary analysis ‚Äî believed first prospective study tracking lung heart outcomes COVID-19 patients ‚Äî also showed shortness breath common symptom 6 weeks discharge, affecting 47% patients, followed coughing, affecting 15%. 12 weeks, 39% patients still experiencing shortness breath, 15% still coughing.""

So 17% nearly 50% people issues 6 weeks recovered week 12. 40% patients still issues. Still seems pretty bad me. what's goal? Get 0 cases? know that's never going happen. Fatique, schools, winter, loosening rules contribute slow rise cases time, that's way keep control. response nonsense first agrees says opposite. Yeah forgot knowing know people corona.


This guy solved covid! needs increased testing? say ones infected true! That‚Äôs new press secretary saying day. still miraculously go away, don‚Äôt know is. told great job Europeans compared US?

But did. least tried That's good know. caught virus back March breathing properly ever since. People different ways dealing stress lol don‚Äôt think deleting emails government server big deal? Interestingly also ton reporting slight symptom relating covid problems marked covid death. Colorado sorted deaths actually likely caused covid infection saw 25% reduction covid related deaths. challenge Latina? 

I hope one day curse speaking spanish removed Earth, breathe free. average age 2001 30. August vacation lot people went riviera course, even new authority it: MSB, obviously something broken communication somewhere.
My feeling basically one authority telling another ""you need X law says so"" (e.g. regions municipalities) say ""Lol budget even 1/10th that"". That's what's broken. Authorities suggesting laws one afford comply with. whose fault that? authority could. regions small budget could. answer ""this working, better change"". family outdoor dining, noticed see indoor seats, everyone like 55+. young people. 
So feel like types indoor dining types good idea things.
So seems left conversation. 
And think yesterday it‚Äôs different report, distinction indoor outdoor dining vastly different. Take 30ish thousand people. give vaccine. many think medical problems. 1 person issue, isnt uncommon. reaction vaccine? medical problem going happen? bound happen. Honestly considering many people around world ok vs 1 person. I'd completely fine taking vaccine available next couple months. Odd way celebrate vaccine whatever gets going brother It‚Äôs people saying ‚ÄúFuck USA‚Äù. You‚Äôre saying fuck people USA/China, you‚Äôre saying fuck policies/how treat citizens world. Like ‚ÄúFuck APPLE doesn‚Äôt mean Tim works sales assistant, means leaders (Tim cook) stand company (country).

Use you‚Äôre brain you‚Äôll go life. huge European tourist destination

And overrated one shit. call Denny‚Äôs Definitely scour, lying, thanks proving point. decide good myself, thaks thanks ways one see man standing close officer unmasked. Masks effective stopping transmission positive individual stopping getting it. (95% vs 70%), dude still putting officer risk. reasonable concern. Neither man video, know officer co-morbidities, hypertension, asthma, COPD, etc. Universal April: ""We're best ensure guest safety that's we're closed notice.""

Universal Now: Well gonna catch it, might well rollercoaster. nagging feeling testing displayed United States. Tests states gone way tests states gone remained high. made feel like number actual tests longer good number go by. created quick Java utility create graph estimated Covid-19 cases using current positive numbers adjusted using state state testing data mid-July.

\---

**Methodology**

Each data point leading 7 day average positive tests. adjusted numbers took leading 7 day average multiplied ratio 7 day average mid-july total tests 7 day average total tests data point. yellow line assumes positive rate tests reported number 80% reported positive rate. attempt show diminishing returns testing have.

This methodology better simply comparing national numbers compares state itself. Ensuring increased testing New York hide decreased testing Florida.

Why? measles suppresses immune system years get it, makes kids likely get sick thus miss school. 

Infectious diseases mess up. Honestly surprised took long slip able catch it. Sucks wife kids though. directly Trump agree saying there, except really strange virus. part fallen line viral infections initially expected. especially virulent contagious, that's expect novel virus caused pandemic. definitely upper respiratory virus. rate goes organs exceptionally high, however still staying within bounds expect part.

Many virologists epidemiologists alike believe OC43 caused severe disease much like COVID first crossed cows humans. theory OC43 caused Russian Flu Epidemic 1889 mistaken influenza growing support evidence. OC43 causes rather nasty cold.

Given enough time right circumstances human body repair almost non devastating damage (except brain cells). virtually reason covid induced damage different. said, really ever tough case flu kind pneumonia, know well took hell time get back even overcoming illness itself. common cold, norovirus super common cruise ships trapped floating petri dish disease relaxing fun!

Hope shop grocery store. also think it'll take people feel 100% comfortable going public too. People going naturally suspicious while. kind presides-a-dent... could've closed borders early on...

Which would what? [Mid locked regions based infection left open.

I think National Guardsmen actually much quicker.

No, really couldn't. countries shit lock back normal?

Taiwan New Zealand. got others? 

It's going happen large country porous borders. AKA embrace suck bye bye dating! Interesting, I've read lot remdesivir studies I've seen done critical patients pretty much. please send link study gave remdesivir early on, ideally RCT. ""3,000 people many. Wake number worth talking about."" - Pandemic Deniers, guess. 

They seem care many people die, get sick, develop myocarditis, MIS-C, though. personally suffer parents, kids, friends, family got sick died late still enough convince friends. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt said reason us wear mask early on. son rsv young developed asthma.  It‚Äôs scary. believe talking stopping droplet penetrating YOU, mask-wearer. still absolutely correct.

The point public mask wearing prevent droplets spreading turning aerosols/microdroplets easily penetrate people's masks, prevent ingesting virus. go party places, completely deserve this. reason family sick Ohh what? articles making up. I'm serious btw, true that's gonna pretty big gamechanger me. Sadly SAE it‚Äôs going significantly longer 3 4 months many them, guarantee, ""know level"" know fundamentally they're wrong, revel it. Angry Jack asshole, I'm convinced anger always guilt, often spite. know fix gun issues social unrest profitable people, that's thing guides policy. Ahh.. shitposting denier wannabe boomer.. thought died since wrong every turn. need hoppers, like flees.

You mean ""fleas""? state in? Sounds like terrible situation, 5 people it, sounds like outbreak...probably No, Murphy actually consulted astrologers big-cat experts coming lockdown rules. makes sense.

Jeez dude, really dumb. Try harder  Spain's 7-day death avg gone 2 60+. 

The mildly promising element cases mini-wave seemed peaked, changes restrictions behaviour take hold. Belgium/NL also 2nd peaks 4 weeks back.

Also worth noting UK doubled testing numbers last two months (and already highest Europe back then). Inevitably that's going find lot cases - look share positives, quite dramatic increase. dead body  give fuck cockroach, nothing said changes. Stupid yes, predictable. Teens known believing invincibility die like anyone else. lot follow restriction cause understand may live 22, could get many killed. sense opening college dorms forced idea invincibile surrounded peers believe matter none, one due young. 

The part sucks likely take precautions despite infected. nearly bad lived self sufficient ecosystem don't. people buy theatre tickets keep shitting Tim Hortons‚Äôs coffee  honestly shocking.

""Are supposed quarantining?""

""Yeah, that's I'm house.""

What. The. Fuck. gotta open little bird lips. Relax throat. US needs grow pair take note. could see considering mask usage social distancing flu. want actually live life normal times. actually like people. *herd feel like that's better measure ""bad"" things are. would imagine cases hear days asymptomatic, mere possibility many people carriers kinda scary.  USA comparably much larger population also one worst Coronavirus responses still first wave. Canada‚Äôs cases going hopefully won‚Äôt reach USAs level pandemic. Eh that's really true. thing viral infection causing permanent organ damage existed COVID-19 did. whole world hoax making trump look like idiot? Get kool aid bleach w/e ur cult drinking. Calling everyone brainwashed propaganda getting getting info Facebook. probably agree nuking hurricane looking eclipse without glasses  I'm coach. Trump lung out. Viruses deadly tend kill/hospitalize hosts transmit.  block them? Remember health experts oblivious virus back January February known better. Shouting flu shows still stuck 2019 mentality. Yeah stupid seems open bars, fact mostly open around (south florida) whole time anyway, hope really make much difference. Delusional people continue delusional conspiracy theory months ago. busy partying trying earn money. care. I've Canada several times. USA-Lite essentially. research would nicely complimented Nyhan Reifler's work ""backfire effect."" Basically, found people presented evidence conflicted strongly held beliefs, evidence seemed entrench subjects' current set opinions rather leaving doubtful.

Nyham Reifler found group identification important factor determining set beliefs particular person embrace. proposal try make people feel good presenting evidence runs contrary current belief system, contrary evidence stands disrupt sense self. I‚Äôm working class I‚Äôm also mad. America never going vote government things mention make best it.

I empathy others‚Äô situations schools open way working class folks go work pay rent / put food table kids learn. America going pay parents stay home else supposed do... America cut unemployment funding, serving friends quitting jobs they‚Äôre loosing money working it‚Äôs slow. unemployment rate skyrocket. David Bowie right. Australia term type person. Cunt. Well changing subject, better public transit helps lot that. could ban motorcycles too. really wanted solve it, we‚Äôd move towards autonomous cars. moving towards regardless people want. I‚Äôm willing let car drive around rather tired driving.

Back Covid death issue. 38,000 people die per year traffic accidents. We‚Äôre 197,499 year far it‚Äôs 6 months. Let‚Äôs focus problem that‚Äôs 10x worse right now. surprised President too, especially recent medical event. \^\^ Double sarcasm anyone else afraid Halloween could pose bigger risk Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day put together?

Think it. You‚Äôre constant face face interaction dozens different households. Kids spread virus too, numerous recent studies shown.

This became scariest Holliday. flu stuff lot BS. Flu less contagious Covid-19, flu nearly totally disappeared Australia. Social distancing keeps transmission Covid around 1 keeps flu transmission well 1.

No flu year northern hemisphere. Taking flu shot harmless totally unnecessary year. may riskier riding bus COVID-19 pandemic

Really? Even infected? millions lives hands volunteers.  publishing that, increased odds people would head private yachts. nope, late now. Yes, Chinese. first. babies born Corona patients next gen aliens. India, Serum Institute initially done equivalent saying ""Well, _we_ see anything, we're gonna continue"" government asked stop anyway based UK thing. assume UK resuming, it'll resume too.

Hopefully US going resume UK does. Though perfectly honest, feels like US trial Oxford vaccine almost little gratuitous, given fair bit far behind even cases thing help vs, say, Brazil. guess countries want stuff tested populace too. fuel anti vaxxers insignificant. 

Canada done nothing special magically attain day without covid deaths.

Cases increasing. 

Deaths occur tomorrow. blind study get placebo get infected want murder whoever gave said placebo. guess would help photos independent safety review committee . whole BLM, LGBTQ DACA hates guts. get vote too. :) Good news doesn‚Äôt get clicks sell ads Canada... island? Obviously can‚Äôt can‚Äôt see good sense asking people stay home god damn pandemic. excitement absolutely justified Yes, that's see it. keep local places afloat. I‚Äôve drowned rain think people's attitudes may change lot bodies pile winter true Swedes meaning they‚Äôre born Swedish citizenship. reason behavior beats Swedes. mean unlikely get ‚Äúspontaneous ‚Äú MS? else people get MS? Cos takes one selfish shithead make bad time everyone else started Nixon. Anyone thinks Humphrey McGovern losing good thing completely misunderstood latter 20th century history. known long sars-cov-2 mutates roughly twice month. incorrectly attributted two-week mutation cycle fast. I'll correct statement. Thank you. returned home 3yrs secondment there. don‚Äôt give fuck anyone else it, Pfizer Moderna require deep freeze spoil?  hear massive panic surge cases media, check death rates deaths still pretty low across board, Spain Germany UK France.. what‚Äôs deal. beautiful comment section. I‚Äôm good mood morning I‚Äôm gonna let walk away now. I'm sure ever stopped countries. quote me. remember reading stopped India. Sorry Trump bot.... We're buying it. McDonald's? Don‚Äôt give fuck cut arm, bleeding!!! No, stopping testing makes go away like miracle. since ww2 good vaccine murder mask/social distancing/closure mandates. There's potential agenda. WOW! Good job Canada! 

With warmest regards,

An American hopes inspire Idiocracy. say inhaling smoke guys haha government proven lying all**. 

""The government"" monolithic entity. Yes, definitely lies coming federal government, state governors, even local officials, endemic across levels, across country (just like literally everything going crazy...**

See above. saying there's chance immaculate infection? guess that's happened patient zero. people wearing N95 masks less likely infected, can't spread infected. accepted mainstream actually mind-boggling used illegal. Like, mind-bogglingly stupid illegal first place, sometimes forget ever was, *until I'm totally baked* surreal realization people countries sitting jail this. 

It's also funny watching people know extremely anti-weed pre-legalization totally chill now. Way raise child certainly developmental issues worst hate best. one world still pursuing eradication. lockdowns still necessary part keeping virus spiraling control (which *also* fuck economy). vaccine really good news members here, could damage case restrictions continue? Wear mask!!

Just make sure it‚Äôs Halloween! Stay safe! leave house you‚Äôll die.

I read report Covid kill Halloween turn lights bathroom say ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù mirror 3 times. blame till blue face. care. going party campus care university /health department tells Agreed. also believe set covid care centres direct infected hospitals, initial shutdown hospitals potential make covid deadlier needed Medscape accounts free, though. Occupation ceased 1949 (or 1955 latest). may aware fact we're 2020.  USE HERD IMMUNITY PROTOCOL. STOP SAYING THIS. FUCKING OLD. Excuse excitement, ladies gentlemen. 


LET'S 
FUCKING 
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Ask source. Sort controversial. Fuck USA (I mean stupid citizens well) Yah, needs breathable air you‚Äôve got handful shitty, minimum wage jobs selling ice cream fatties trucking around pedicabs? Hah, exactly would republicans go Biden wins? Brazil? also dumbass president, might make feel home. make responsible outbreaks, no? blaming correct. integration

Meaning people vandalises ambulances arent 'true' swedes? think anyone arent human *Immediately eaten meth gator* even bringing HIV compare SARS-CoV-2?

To illustrate point. explain comment replying to. can't smoke weed instead? might help anxiety can't OD. Second wave predicted. would total number death factor it‚Äôs safe lower restrictions today? cruise industry never recovered nothing value would lost. Tbf dumb American jokes around least half decade point. you‚Äôre going cover slavery flowery excuses, it‚Äôs easier shovel everything else. one realistically expects lockdowns eradicate virus. necessary get virus control enough manage non-lockdown methods. 

The anti-lockdown crowd loves complain economy, ones prolonging damage sabotaging efforts get virus control. honestly don‚Äôt know. 

How much traffic deaths ok with?

Over million life-years lost motor vehicle accidents per year US great deal predictability. could get close zero things like dramatically curb speed limits to, say 10mph electronically limit cars that, put ban deem ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù travel, etc. would support that? level traffic deaths ok avoid world?

I wear mask well. wore one recommended, haven‚Äôt stopped. Never ever cite link BILD. 
They paid chat messages 11 years old boy, lost family, mother killed younger siblings. every single person party already tested positive, what's harm letting congregate? sentence queue disposing masks party like it‚Äôs 1999 again. /S Keep covid aged care fatalities stay pretty low Yes, exactly. time visits nobody even eats meal ashore. There's one huge flaw plan: we're learning, around world, far many people *have moral values*.  


I can't count number times last months I've tried (and sadly failed, guess I'm skilled enough get people) explain normal care lives others, okay care others, *should* care lives others.  
It feels like trying explain colour person who's born blind. :( He‚Äôs also 79 number one reason: population. India's population 1.38 billion four times US, caseload like US getting 24,000 new cases day, factoring under-counting countries.

On hand, one wonders whether India's situation needs today. recall, India's Prime Minister announced one strictest lockdowns world four hours notice, caught tens millions migrant workers completely off-guard, crowded get buses, walked hundreds miles villages. mass uncontrolled migration may fact seeded Covid unaffected areas. unknowable number deaths due sudden loss livelihoods starvation. Almost every country tried lock least gave people time opportunity get intended shelter orderly fashion, even arranged extra transport. fact Bangladesh Pakistan, despite similar wealth high population densities India, managed contain Covid far better India. governor Massachusetts literally get PPE smuggled New England Patriots airplane escorted airport state police feds steal it. promise, am. grew playing basketball tournaments Canada. love country. ashamed tariffs closest alliance.

I'm particularly curious heart damage also improves I've told family celebrate Christmas 2022. r/unexpectedpoetry Yeah weve slowly loosening restrictions Ontario, best day like 75 cases, 200+ today. top that, kids going back school here. Everyone work agreed go weeks like start closing things again. shit lol forget original plan two weeks flatten curve hospitals get overwhelmed? good point. It‚Äôs funny National mandates (re: countries) proven effective way get virus control. We're literally 50 different ways. Plus 50 different ways freely cross 49 different ways. 

We topdown application social distancing Federal Government fucked us. Trump fucked us people still like him?! Final destination reddit. Everyone else NPC. 

Hardcore even ... factual point

I conceding correct wrong...? high indeed suspicious change trend data (a sudden suppression certain states aligned one pary) exactly coincided timing data-processing hand-off. Even conclusively prove data somehow fraudulent, still qualifies degree ""credible evidence"" warrant questioning taking closer look.

And indeed still yet offer anything conjecture shouldn‚Äôt trust data seeing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* People need stop selfish ignorant, stay hell home, respect guidelines. virus real fools. Coworker needs wear mask EVERY TIME gets sick. Asian coworkers always wore masks office whenever got sick even covid19. understand protecting people offics seriously hope never meet ""influencer"". I've come hate idea. mean it‚Äôs relative. I‚Äôm sure 10 deaths day means Nebraska. 

New York sitting around 10 deaths day corona well, obviously big difference. Surprise surprise get vaccine, what's point wearing mask? Dang looks much like Steven Pinker took \~100 years laws, cajoling, PSAs, tragedy cut drunk driving today US: 15k deaths per year. drunk driving enforcement treated similarly pandemic hygiene, would probably several hundred thousand DUI related deaths per year too. 4 kids school aged (we 5 total, including newborn) got tested Monday Covid. bet ass 4 Covid first DAY school. first DAY Friday week before, Sunday sick. Newborn also it. Yay us.

Luckily (???), adults (husband I) already December (we go major town medical appointments, got OB town). So, really sick like kids are. went get testing done, kids 1 2 saw many classmates line, too. So, definitely outbreak...and rural. Maybe 100 kids total school system (K-12).

There online options, all. kids get sick, get sick go back school. require masks school, kid 2 overheard one kids saying ""Thank God wearing masks, to!"" later caught spitting kids. think like 6 yr old, nope kid 12. ripped kids school immediately (some teacher complaining today pissed off), told back better precautions online schooling, vaccine. I'm back homeschooling meantime, before. fun trying work take care newborn, especially 5 total kids.

Fuck.

Edit: go town leave property month, nowhere near school started (3 weeks 4 days went). strict regimes comes going public coming home, due baby mostly wanting sick (didn't help much, guess). work home, live near anyone - woods. definitely got kids school (we assume kid 2, kids like girl spitting others since showed symptoms first). shutting tackling pandemic aggressively, country worse state longer period time. 

The willfully ignorant ""living lives"" rest us behaving trying right thing. honestly incredibly frustrating. crackdown leadership. Rule fucking bullies. Wow actually know quite people took it, thanks info. ask though, get doses from? may get horse paste cheapest dose get, makes feel stupid lol.  fuckin bananas like 45% people approve him. Thank you! THIS. people sorry *after* fact, people even death loved one enough make careful, truly feel ""numb"" new normal. Yes, still feel compassion sorrow, distant blurry, makes sense. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean... statement false. Many recovered baseline, ""vast majority"". many survivors long term complications. think hit key point here: local stores make sense since things need fairly fresh delivery someone walk aisles place optimized maximize customer‚Äôs selection completely inefficient, especially coupled customers also competing supply directly. 

Dense cities could warrant different approach scales improves quality. Suburban rural seem much likely hit miss demand however. Also Canadian here, im wondering happens loses? claim election sham?

Like doesnt see dignity office, hes power, dont think hes even money? shit. Anyone brain could forsee this. Everytime hear ""kIdS cAnT gIVe aDuLTs"" laugh. not? Kids catch resp. virus know give adult. would make sense kids catch it, spread it. know catch it. special child cant transfer contagious disease infected with? Nothing. Hospitalization issue island even icu. Kids going back school gonna party up. degree safety important course. 100 percent effective vaccine kills 20 330 million people, deploy immediately. numbers certainly wont work like that, imagine complication rate high thousand severe adverse reactions per 330 mil (using pop US) high efficacy could still worth it, especially depending complications were. 

To point efficacy well, even low efficacy might worth complication rate relatively low. flu vaccine example kinda sucks low complication rate recommendation population large get every year.

But come consensus, suspect agree completely depends numbers are. grandma tested negative COVID last week spite seeing weekly since May partying friends pretty consistently since May. Quit false choice bullshit. social life grandparents, ultimately pass unfortunate part life. sooner recognize reality better. necessarily true. person may diagnosed illness prior trial properly disclose study. think you‚Äôre unaware many people die United States daily due needless causes.

Look south that. Let's face it, human race stupid times.  used think world flat, sun revolved around earth God sky.  even think Trump second coming Christ.   LPT. Mary crazy argue stupid think reality even worse: *want* people die, want lot die. aim 'deplorables' get hit hardest, 'poor white folk' caught crossfire (so speak) seems acceptable collateral damage.  


Or, least, that's looks like Canadian. So, sick disturbing watch happen, *with support citizens!* JFC!  think NJ restaurants pretty good job outdoor dining. places shit job avoid places. Don‚Äôt go every night maybe twice week. It‚Äôs obviously risk go work every fricken day indoors outdoor dining proper distancing much smaller risk. Seems like process approving study getting published slow scientists answer questions people four months ago. almost feels like they're refusing work people actually want know. ‚ÄúSorry grandma, either Applebee‚Äôs.‚Äù monkey trials primarily prevented severe disease prevented retransmission. 

The Pfizer one also one induce larger immune response virus IIRC.

Oxford might easiest get around, doubts effective. 

Keep mind temperature limitations Pfizer probably big deal US/Europe. insurmountable. Sadly could see used excuse keep hands developing nations though. excuse western world horde works. small worry mine. Overall Pfizer top pick vaccines available us. Chinese vaccines look pretty good prevented retransmission monkey trials, trust issues China course. Tourism. Hospitality... Downtown dead.

US, never got baseline people ""doing right"" perpetually isolated home end sight. would much rather months felt like could visit family without fear. confirm rival counterpart Islamabad also reacted positively vaccine. know thing called per capita. takes account population sizes different countries. 

So argument mut PER CAPITA America extremely far worse Canada handling this

Also, let know found Canadian PM saying pandemic hoax telling people wear masks. COVID people would feel victim died. may died something else, sure. wild died this

You fucking look families face tell precious member wasn‚Äôt worth putting restrictions place. You‚Äôre dense

Edit: go ahead remove comment, mods. know that‚Äôs favorite thing idiots get called I‚Äôm sick hate skeptics fly face use massive recession mass unemployment reasons lockdown bad idea? kind stupid argument, virus's fault, lockdowns! know, redheads, *need* lockdown chosen ramp testing tracing instead! like South Korea! Sure mean I‚Äôm denying list many things either patently false grossly exaggerated Nearly everything people going came America. Note said ""social media"" rather facebook. :) services skew younger, others older. Wait.. we‚Äôre allowed travel Germany? Ya seriously get criminal charges this. Florida man I'm sure proud start trying harder elevate Florida Man status. I'd like true smiled moment thought - sadly isn't. well 1,000 people Antarctica. millions active cases North America, millions South America, millions Asia, well million Europe. that's going confirmed cases. well 1/1000 population infected.

Maybe they'd infected Oceania. quarantine setup doesn‚Äôt fancy, what‚Äôs concerning one checks quarantined students several days. know they‚Äôre adults, student gets sick campus, least need staff monitoring make sure (1) don‚Äôt break quarantine (2) aren‚Äôt dead/dying. know...

but town recently water main break. utility company sent texts customer telling us boil water. real surprise there. however, something caught eyes.  said ""keep water boiling least 10 minutes"" disinfect. 10 minutes? kind virus germ survive boiling water 9 minutes 59 seconds? don‚Äôt even need scientist understand ‚Äúresearchers‚Äù deserve title. Exhibit A.  There's one way find out, eh? :) Reading comments reddit still gives hope smart Americans there. sad people believe Fox news like Bible. America one worst responses corona virus, try make look like we've good job. I'm ashamed half American. Also half German, mother never got paperwork done. everything ready go German passport soon consulates open new dual citizen enrollments. ever win lottery, I'm leaving good. Can't take anymore, especially Trump president.  mean UK, Spain, Italy rising case numbers. please stop pretending America place can't control Covid. 

America massive. states done excellent job initially terrible (see northeast), states recently issue already much better (the south general), states still major issues (Wyoming, Dakotas etc). Kind like EU timeline moved month two. varies. I'd say 50/50 I've seen. guy rickrolled Rick Astley? first wave vaccines likely 30-50% effective. low bar, lets make sure least hit that.

Nonsense. 

Also crisis like determine vaccine effective easily. Vaccinate 200 people volunteers , purposefully expose virus. See many get sick two weeks. That's takes. Seems like China Russia sensible countries crisis. rest world extremely inefficient handling pandemic. much red tape nonsense procedures. *crisis*, normal rules apply. seems now. still taste smell. feel ok extremely good projecting issues onto people Blue red stars New Zealand flag.

The white red blue flag cross cross pre-colonial flag. Fringe groups sometimes use mean whatever want mean. 

The red blue flag white stars flag Samoa. Ironic Samoa lost 22% population Spanish Flu. course.

How keep protected ppe restaurant need remove said protection everytime want eat?

I still understand people want eat restaurant this. Order out, better yet, make something home! Ah, yes, *I'm sure* people visiting inmates *never* come contact anyone else, all, leave penitentiary.

&amp;#x200B;

/S average American Facebook 40.5 years old. roughly half (mean vs median blah blah) Facebook users exactly young.  And? guess Secretary Mark Inch think enough inmates/people died yet.  


Sadly, I'm sure move 'success'. symptoms? Taste smell? hope you‚Äôre okay! Thank saying this. someone supposed get married next May (booked pandemic started), really hoping something feel terrified wedding make people sick. I'm prepared reduced guest count, masks dancefloor, socially distanced outdoor dinner, rapid testing guests, etc. hopeful somewhere ""old normal"" then, scary hear black white statements mess. I'm supposed think virus cannot survive Fedex box survive burning earth's atmosphere? disagree extent, would vaccination given massive portion population quickly. Damn well better safe. 

For record know safety issues primary concern much efficacy. starting point safety still important ever. headline. statistics mask use social far changed terms social distancing compared countries, mask use next zero   I‚Äôm constantly dismayed many people want dine restaurant work at. feels like unnecessary game Russian Roulette. Trust me, wait staff appreciate business, they‚Äôd rather dine in. testing vaccine long others though. time period 1/4 fastest produced vaccine ever. blowing trials fast possible without severely compromising safety. 

Also, gotta make sure vaccine actually effective. rushed vaccine low efficacy save many lives erode public's trust vaccination. disaster scenario need avoid. 

This first wave vaccines likely 30-50% effective. low bar, lets make sure least hit that. germany that's wrong arrive high-risk area No, they're not, lives hands people making drug. volunteers test subjects see people making drug correctly. person's illness illuminated misstep process previously unknown side effect, actually feel quite opposite guilt. 2022 probably. can't see could get vaccine general population next summer. Mr. Ms Science then. Delighted make acquaintance! That's coming high risk area. place arrive high risk area required tell local health department get tested, received negative result allowed leave quarantine runs (14 days arrival)

read somewhere another european country, know one could one that's high risk country. arrived USA she'd quarantine Thats said lol. Next time try smug, read comment you‚Äôre replying to. COVID disease. SARS2 virus. hope see too, doubts smooth. behavior warrant prison sentence might well legalize murder. Especially given massive recession mass unemployment created similar problems Americans interested hearing less 1/3 population. Melbourne assure lot angst lockdown article might suggest. Many people questioning ‚Äúroad map‚Äù laid state leader strictness (basically lockdown end October that‚Äôs provision 5 cases day) 

I personally support tough measures time think government going way way far needless measures past usefulness date. least believe remove curfew put place remove 5km radius restriction put place way harsh keep end October. Horific how? way us go back march numbers given way things set now. Garbage What's frightening 12 kids getting infected led one hospitalization.

This bad, may well be. irony comment un-paused trial week, nowhere near enough time properly figure illness vaccine related. Imagine getting Gastroenteritis Covid.

Wait no, remember Event! forbidden! I've asking exact question years neighborhood going candy. worried all. read Rio Grand valley, local divert patients nearby hospitals spare capacity, far know entire area ran much capacity nowhere send people. could wrong that. haven‚Äôt read yet. Given I‚Äôm level education, able discern fucking idiots. Now, part got right government needs strategy communicate strategy effectively, ignoring science calling fear real scientists do....and given one, I‚Äôm qualified make judgement. piece shit. antisocial! part get. college kids likely left older crowd likely right? get politized exact opposite way handle. Like yeah right want masks whatever neither people generally lean left. 

I guess get something like turned politic hot topic sides really seem give rats ass it. Joe Rogan finally right something? I‚Äôm sorry stupid Well, seek another line employment...it's rough unfortunately true. No, virus discussion CCP's cover going make pay letting virus first place. US simply home took fire damage arsonist. said, US fine \_second place\_ topic, largest victim CCP's cover up. like freedom work attend funeral loved one suppose word ""theory"" (especially without ""conspiracy"" front it) implies sort evidence.

This hypothesis. completely untested hypothesis evidence whatsoever, really, like baseless guess. connections making (""a meteor happened brought COVID"") generic could applied anything. That‚Äôs certainly possibility, couldn‚Äôt determine wasn‚Äôt related vaccination, could also cautiously proceed reviewing prior data ensure didn‚Äôt miss cases. It‚Äôs impossible prove negative, can‚Äôt prove *wasn‚Äôt* caused vaccine, trial sponsors regulators know better scrap whole thing. cases, continue watch cases; bet ass there‚Äôs second transverse myelitis case trial, vaccine candidate getting chucked dustbin.

That said, fact they‚Äôre continuing shows didn‚Äôt definitively show adverse effect *was* caused vaccine, nice. Actually, even though NCLEX countries, even try register province (in case BCCNP), first get review organization called NAAS. take long time, case office shut 6 months right finishing review. finally apply BCCNP, need take additional practicum clinical test. . .which course happening right now.

The whole situation sucks, we‚Äôll get it. cases increased whole week! want go sporting event, use tests make sure one  Well, overlooking, reported falsely too. Officials first said member US Armed Forces media reported US tourist. According [this (in German) indeed returned Germany another country recently - country Europe, US. member US Armed Forces working them.  

I'm sure that's actually incredibly important though. still went partying symptoms became superspreader - piece information correct. page linked says Kansas started releasing data clusters form 3 days ago. far, data worth much guys anecdotal evidence. mention can't find says many cases churches responsible for. Yeah, concerned say something like first example. That's thoroughly line patient privacy also allays fears. ""we're restarting trial, everything's fine, nothing happened"" quite cut me. 3rd? Time I've asked say universal mail voting necessary won't, ends discussion. Thanks. Bought 500 bucks worth weekly supplements family 

Smallest pill I‚Äôve ever seen week dosage chance vaccine gets approved one month now. That's really good news. I've read, China conducting vaccine trials countries like Brazil Indonesia, China enough Covid cases. assume they're also rushing vaccine various reasons like: (i) geopolitical - want US beat it, use access US vaccine means coerce countries adopt anti-China policies, Trump probably would do; (ii) countries large numbers cases weigh dilemma saving lives timely manner ensuring vaccine safety, willing approve vaccine emergency use (frontline medical staff, elderly people, etc) benefits outweigh risks? charged bioterrorism. angers see insensitive ppl pandemic. that's it, Northeast California reopen. New York City literally opened dining week numbers astronomically low long time.

Go look curves New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, tell flatten curve. crushed curve.

And considering none southern states heavily criticized death tolls even approach happened Northeast Europe hard argue healthcare systems overwhelmed / prepared.

And would think looking news nobody wears mask America. Well live live southern city tell mask wearing probably 99%, months. Pretty much, unethical purposefully infect people covid wait catch naturally. people catching naturally difficult tell whether vaccine actually works want thank thinking guests! lack selfishness make great spouse! I'm starting think Americans unironically believe *we're* dumb ones.   No, said ‚Äúaccepting deaths illnesses‚Äù. Hopefully eventually safe enough break social distance kids. ;) 2000CAD = 1580USD, ensure apples-to-apples U ok? comes Windows Vista Damn fatalistic view... 

I'm curious change new world then? awful picture is, smile, catching covid.  Since post one ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù ones, thought update lives don‚Äôt matter? would easy start giving $200 fine anyone wearing mask. Instead we've decided containing covid even less important sorts minor infractions like jay-walking staying parking space long.

American Police unions representatives part declared goign enforce covid guidelines. agree well-known politician intentionally downplayed significance disease. 

Anecdotally speaking also never seen police officer actually wear mask pandemic. Glad hear deaths dropping, doubts it. county 7 since yesterday‚Äôs update. Smaller county, hotspot. San Diego here/ opened 25% indoor dining ( 80 ) place. honestly we‚Äôve way busy weekends recently would last year around time. We‚Äôre talking 300-400+ weekends it‚Äôs crazy feel like people think it‚Äôs over. 

Anyways stay safe everyone!! Unfortunately, isn‚Äôt case. ‚Äú[Oxford] signed exclusive vaccine deal AstraZeneca gave pharmaceutical giant sole rights guarantee low prices‚Äîwith less-publicized potential Oxford eventually make millions deal win plenty prestige.‚Äú Since post one ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù ones, thought update Whatever prediction match reality complete trash. Sorry know pessimists love shit, c'mon really? current 7 day average deaths 700 declining, also trailing indicator weeks cases, also declining. nothing indicating going rise tremendously. would average 2000 deaths day reach number, last wave everyone panicking FL TX average 1200 day. need stop pushing stories cause fuel deniers. #ID SAY LIKE 3 5.

I‚Äôve worked retail long time current numbers. Genuinely love question president / antimask , literally know get mainstream  point title misleading supplements shown help already healthy vitamin levels. adding valuable information discussion instead nitpicking namecalling appear add value all. precious snowflake, feel one? want tested virus till running rampant... They're effective whoever's planning them. Lockdowns effective they're used method make COVID disappear permanently, case New Zealand. Lockdowns effective they're used stop large outbreaks get cased manageable level, seen cases China, Italy, Singapore. How? change things? Youre likely get cardiomyopathy covid. want play ball ever stay fuck home stop whining football, get cardiomyopathy guess football you, fun young getting CHF. childish insult fact obviously read link tell man science vote everyone.  really interesting data. general trends make sense, including countries barely affected already returning normal. 

It‚Äôd interesting continue follow trend it‚Äôs great indicator returning ‚Äònormal‚Äô. newsweek site garbage?  think he's making fun obese people. He's probably mentioning many obese people vitamin deficient, hard know vitamin deficiency causing people serious outcomes virus. *shrug*

Been forever. Never damaged coated lenses.

But sure, err side caution doubt. Iowa Nebraska voted it. coach, president wanted play. article fixed says 26-year old German... sunscreen brands foundation makeup, women claim wear sunscreen getting makeup. Even mineral based ones organic brands use mineral sunscreen. 2020 nutshell massive american policy failures.

extrajudicial murder going centuries keep going indefinitely unless stop it. really, border 500 km south Wild hypothesis. Americans learn meaning ‚Äútheory‚Äù applies science? sure wrote article, 
but that's worst German read week üòÇ. American feel like got lumped bad kids they're table group class miss recess stupidity. Yep. point might get high efficacy vaccine takes years. first round vaccines marginal hopefully good enough give us upper hand people, lots people, still get sick even vaccinated still need practice social distancing mask wearing quite time.

It amazes many folks don‚Äôt realize that. dad said ‚Äúwhy corona revealed testing done? aren‚Äôt people reporting themselves? mean, don‚Äôt see people dying streets able breath. don‚Äôt get spread people still somehow ok‚Äù

He thinks corona something almost kills you. since don‚Äôt see people dying streets, means corona spread isn‚Äôt...real.

I tried explaining asymptomatic mild, still covid-19. But, don‚Äôt know enough tell convince that... sigh... isn‚Äôt hoax.

Please educate educate him. fair. 40% us like that. Yes, they're coronaviruses. I'm aware. 

One significantly pathogenic other. might well compare second wave Spanish Flu current seasonal flu. They're influenza! cares one's closed case CFR 20-30 times higher, they're basically identical! Europe: Damn cases rising France UK Spain....we got second wave

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* call bullshit. church took place outside masks, would probably cut transmission acceptable levels.

""Clown"" Link? institutions' fault government doesn‚Äôt hoard money.  used various reasons.  didn‚Äôt get 3 trillion debt year simply government doesn‚Äôt try.  may terrible job. try. either FEEL sorry, sorry. SARS closely related virus humans. scientific name virus causes COVID literally ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"" seems like American/Alberta take measures prevention. It‚Äôs creeping around edges school districts aren‚Äôt even meeting person, too.

Our district football player test positive Wednesday. Rather quarantine team - practiced Thursday scrimmaged neighboring district Friday. Team members also attended in-person district club meetings three days well.

So far district hasn‚Äôt informed relevant potentially exposed parties. point, information secondhand - school official friend. I‚Äôm liberty specific, suffice say - south central school district (or two) learning next week so. I'm right moment trying convince family member that. keep telling order out, they're young think they're invisible. shit?  Yeah, demonize people decided opening colleges good idea. It‚Äôs true. ""conspiracy theorist"". think covid 19 man made. considered could used depopulation tool, control mechanism, political ploy. wear mask public. go eat, shop aside food, pretty much take every logical precaution can. real virus really kills people even though world views readily admit ignorance. Regardless why, happening. Pretty impressive group ""practically immune"". sounds similar measures European countries took. northern hemi countries strict measures summer, eased enter fall expect things slide backwards. coming spring guess next month's might better think travel anywhere next months. 711 day, 30 days? 21330, 2 tens change. Poo poo particles go nose fart, Yes, linked article. know saying. We've definitely found chinese cuisine. po tofu one favorite foods, finding right ingredients key. lost nothing America. 

Get lost Chinese bot!  Another American understand rest world

Lemme guess, still think America best place world live too? Fauci said needs least 70% effective. Safety requirements much higher though. read UK trial 10k US 30k. also larger outbreaks right may provide better comparison stats. hit Costco morning thought. Time replenish anything let run little. hope I'm wrong. also hoped wrong started stocking January. Yeah Canada, government annoyed get 700 day, yet USA 60k day it‚Äôs good  hope happen too, sad survive incompetent country, least sister lives Singapore. Anyways

Might well say ""100% people eat tomatoes end dying!""

This brings back echoes early pandemic, lots pundits US kept saying people die X (flu, car accidents, cancer, etc) covid. took finally stop that.

Neither us able convince other, let's end here.   Thankfully I'm office worker (just care worker here,so worse guess) busier public transport people forced back offices, including clients? good. What's rush people work home safely like government decides worth sacrificing economy save people, rather sacrificing people save economy.

But hey that's me. going great. Yep. Name checks out. virus discussion entirely US. don‚Äôt get shit together it‚Äôs bad us. one two states could wait fourteen days declining cases slowly reopening.  shining example state mental health US.  needs major push deal lack mental health care created thousands upon thousands sociopaths like literally killing people right pandemic. problem can't normal life, someone preventing shit load people dying around you. So, many friends sit everyone someone know dead, whole fanilies whiped off. 

Don't underestimate power fear. People stay inside get scared enough, moarning, would scared drink you.

And conclude, even disturb normal life, people would pissed see untouched virus made lives hell, would happy someone drink you, engry crowd beat selfishness. 700 whole Canada may seem like lot almost 99% population lives cities, albeit super dense ones like Europe still. means lot contact tracing. 

Here BC we‚Äôve around 100+ range province 5 million 2-2.5 living one relatively spread dense area. nothing ever this, unless think pool party medical workers border control staff. BonJURno. Averaging one day seem like lot surface. put way: little 500 people died mass shootings 2019. 330 million people, number miniscule. People died snakebites 10x rate last year, put little better perspective.

Im sorry subreddit american? european see like ‚Äúwhat bring table‚Äù. downgrade 9/11 anything really important subreddit? We've lot infections come aged care facilities Victoria (Australia) second wave, well way deaths first wave. definitely right point number 2. really feel like lost credibility pandemic. Basically whatever say. opposite probably true. Work home, stay schools. countries let Americans ports? Shame least worries sociopaths start getting hit lawsuits recklessly putting others danger. Let‚Äôs agree disagree would possible countries Sweden, UK France. endemic nature spread, constitutions land borders seriously interconnected economies. 

Sweden chose long term strategy aiming level measures throughout pandemic. France used hammer dance. NZ went eradication. USA...well can‚Äôt say US picked.

Countries different conditions going pandemic, strategies somewhat consequence that. 

Let‚Äôs give year two make final analysis. Countries different strategies might actually good thing perspective make us wiser next big pandemic. bit cynical know, still true. WELL! Carry then. Congrats Asymptomatic people organ damage issues. outwardly show symptoms mean damage. 100% would take YOU! Cider costs same, well! early first wave, virus spreading HALF YEAR beforehand life never understand anyone would ever want go cruise Stop comparing infectious diseases fucking car accidents. refuse believe people fucking stupid. Amazing adults cook this. spending 10 times money food. really weird stupid... Yes man, id rather live normal life before.

If gets me, might well fun instead sitting home, making aquariums shit. Ya mention price hard liquor like 3-4x price US people never satisfied pandemic measured number deaths. number infected. deaths start going ( ever) start talking lockdown. pointless. Let's remember virus IFR less 0. 3%. Let's chill f out. Well... Four comments, really.  eventually get can't stay isolated forever. Montreal Monday/Tuesday everyone properly wearing mask saw. Universities opened think trend last. went LCBO tonight flooded students. promise drinking alone 6 feet apart. really think so? mean, think reason sucked much first legit know anything, ever since started saying ""wear masks!"" I've noticed (and others too, noticed) people started pay lot less attention physical distancing requirement, also care much person also wearing mask. 1% actually disruptive society even sounds like ""small"" number head.

Several times 1% need hospital treatment. need keep curve flat nd hospitals functioning things people still need hospital treatment for. let thing run rampant, people dying causes, fragile old people. 9 years, can't bargain virus. ""just old sick"", even though stating even argument sounds psychopatic.

You simply sound like 0.5% small, happen you. So, people even mild sympthoms shown long term effects, virus able attack multiple organ systems means stop it, relying mankind cohesion. Actually, man made, would brilliant way give us chance, but, see example, still pretty confident would spread world. Hahahaha yeah, shock system... Can't buy holidays, can't grab six-pack corner store. thought new Canadian friends pranking explained me. :) Oh economy. Giant corporations fine, this, they'll absolutely everything, forever. :) believe govt seems really anything increasing numbers.

That's completely true, closed night clubs banquet halls days ago. continuing really aggressive contact tracing suppress outbreaks blow up, last month put extra funding this.

My savings runs end October, I'll homeless I'll lose car around time well. tried stretch savings long possible, even started water fasting every week (skipping meals entirely every week consuming water), five months much savings handle. Never wildest dreams expect unemployed long. 


And top off, government ended $600 per week unemployment stimulus went making $860 per week (which slightly less made new job), $260 per week even enough cover rent. I'm fucked. Completely utterly ruined Covid. Build wall ! Bro 9 months gives fuck.

I'm alive ""hunker down"" old people fragile. Yeah ... masks less distancing significantly tolerable even masks full distancing. revealed 22 20,000 9/11 first responders survivors represented ground zero-related illnesses died COVID-19.

20,000 responders. NYC infection rate 2.8%. 571 infected. Assuming average age 30 first responders. That‚Äôs 4.8% mortality rate. we‚Äôd anticipate 27 deaths due COVID. That's good sign. say pandemic end infection ends, ends public ready move on. evidence moving forward, albeit slowly, towards social end pandemic. drove delivery throughout pandemic currently virus. Spare story victimized. know much reason continue work ""healthcare job"" option support yourself. neither business owners actively bankrupt pandemic. personally would wear mask respect others isolated. believing severity virus exclude decent human comes respecting others wishes. said, ""precautions"" half measures taken equal nothing (as case Sweden), instead harming way life further, concerned freedom quarantine, freedom go go daily lives operate businesses normal. virus, without vaccine, least risk going die. best isolate best possible, something want do. nation large going conform rules perfectly, sometimes results loss human life. many individuals way anyway, covid straw broke camel's back, who's say... I'm near Toronto. really rare. pandemic, US averaging mass shooting per day. uncommon, really.

And shootings - whole fascism-curious thing US going right now. Safaris protesters. Latino kids cages. Killer cops.

To answer question - Canada gigantic gun massacre significant gun reform afterwards, yeah, would've felt unsafe well. I‚Äôm Canada Sadly, understand soon. Good job Canada! Let's go night club foam / makeout party celebrate ! losing much talent skilled professionals. Politicians, FUCKING JOBS RAT PIECES SHIT! Yeah, great news BC 132 new cases today. couple months ago 15 new cases per day. Need turn around.  city? note says could ""safely go without getting infected"". ""when mask mandates lifted"". Oh lord lungs good enough that. Last time smoke got bad work like week half. Practice makes perfect - thanks! :) remember 36% Americans believe USA better job handling Covid-19 Canada. fundamentals Canada üá®üá¶ meters apart. Wear mask. Wash hands frequently. kind. **Always apologize**


Ftfy there's lots deaths? small town sucks easy numbers look better many infected people. hard people wrap head around fact get control, life go back normal relatively little risk emphasis control.

I'm sure follow saying. German kids never wore masks, even getting 6-7k new cases per day. 

Germany decided institute mask mandate late April, kids 6-7 (it varies region) exempt mandate. Germany still managed get virus less ""under control"" (though back around 1500 cases day now, dropped 2-300s prior re-opening things). 

I'm certainly trying say clearly extrapolate important masks small kids looking national numbers Germany.

But tend trust German health authorities make sensible decisions things like this. That's suprised see US politician universally derided saying something German health experts also seem saying. Healing skin muscle different healing organ like kidney, liver, lungs. remember watching real time CNN MSNBC around March Early April estimated deaths 2,000,000 2020 COVID. 

Now I‚Äôm sure lockdowns helped bit death toll, let‚Äôs also keep mind many states bungled COVID. literally sent COVID positive people nursing homes. Ventilators deemed necessary realized possibly caused deaths used less now.

I‚Äôm pointing finger anyone, again, knew beginning people certain conditions certain age higher risk. believe personally continue locking majority, placing curfews, nonsense. better informed, protect high risk. 

We cannot live like another year. way vaccines going it‚Äôs promising. COVID stay need learn live it. u/repeatwad right, except lenght hard lockdown proposal.

Wonder real death count can't teach kid?  thinks apocalypse problem bringing kid world right now. really think ""that bad"" idea getting pregnant, work one high risk places ever, scary. Never mind can't afford husband actively said want another one.

But basically, can't leave details. know, interviewing bunch ""reopen schools"" people, think I've come realize differences people's response.

People say things like ""Stop acting like KNOW FACT kids transmit Adults. might make common sense, science ASSUME things. anti-science right now.""

The implication being, since KNOW FACT kids transmit adults, _____.

To people, response ""... cautious, assume worst-case-scenario verify not.""

To people, response ""... everything normally (reopen schools), deviating normal verify bad.""

These different types people can't really communicate since world views different.  reminder deaths lag significantly behind new cases, take couple weeks see outcomes those. weeks ago daily cases France began spike again, naturally current infection rates yet reflect deaths currently reported.

Edit: confused France UK, fixed. Daily new deaths declining since late July. That's gone done 1/3. (1800 1200) Daily new cases declined much.

There doubts accuracy reporting, new cases (fewer tests done) deaths (more deaths ascribed causes)

I'm sure projections pessimistic. without therapeutics won‚Äôt. EKGs, Japan Australia look healthy.

I'm restrictions lighter begin with, damaged economy less, would room keep enforcing them, maybe even imposing lockdown hospitals close overwhelmed. 

The still money room enforce lockdown, even though ""total"" necessary.

At worst like 500 intensive - herd immunity lot countries

There herd immunity anywhere. 

 techniques improve death rate slightly significantly

No - significantly. trillions destroyed world economy justification lockdowns would colossal waste money.

No. Sweden lost money us. help economy let loose. 

It destroys consumption people choice go out. tons sick people, many people simply stay home go spend money, kills economy.

Honestly, stupidity surreal.  Oh fault. brain derped reading comment. Adults tested positive coronavirus twice likely dined restaurant within two-week period prior becoming sick, 

The interesting version would been:

 Adults tested positive coronavirus twice likely dine restaurant within two-week period becoming sick Sure are. could catch manner virus Covid. pay take cruise years , much less day.  No1 cares Republican thoughts Americans quotation marks? Nope, didnt. troll... evidence Swedish strategy ""right""? According Wednesday, first time since spring, higher rates infection registered Norway Sweden. Denmark 2.1 new cases per 100,000 people, Norway 1.5 Sweden 1.1, according TT news agency.

So one day's data vindicates months failure? bad clickbait-y take.

Meanwhile, look deaths per 1M pop., Sweden 578 Denmark 109 Norway 49. feed trolls... That‚Äôs exact reason it‚Äôs going last long. people right thing would lot quicker fair it‚Äôs liberals burning country down.

All points valid though still way less deaths per capita. Moron. it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve heard Dr. Daniel Griffin week virology (twiv) talk doctors believing long haulers. He‚Äôs supportive ling haulers says doctors listen patients. don‚Äôt know way get touch get recommendation doctor help get better. 1 30k people get paralyzed vaccine idiots take vaccine. would need therapeutics implemented proper quarantine testing. fact is, point, dispute.

I mean disparage people enroll trials, commenting must fools. Wei Liozi said ancient military classic: ""Employ stupid wise - **Employ stupid fear death** employ wise skillful."" roll everyone pandemic. Yeah, sooo much better dead, cause deaths others, 'live fear'.

Best programming makes defend paradigm vehemently gusto....even though Donny's cock deep inside them. right. recommending people trick treat instead banning it. It'll interesting see NYC Chicago decide. recent study showed people rode public transportation 4 times likely catch it.

There lot confounding factors could lead result without people actually catching virus public transport. instance, anyone riding bus height lockdown probably worked essential job forced house. people regularly take public transport almost certainly live densely populated area. I‚Äôll probably still iffy masks, I‚Äôll rip soon Tamiflu equivalent Covid comes readily available go back pre-Covid times catch something easily beat medicine found early.

Secondly, growth new cases per day occurring 3 weeks deaths rise turn. gave idea December ""hit America?"" Bad news = good faith, important, accurate

Good news = bad faith, stupid, science

It's simple Setting people work go find work terrible idea

Corporate interests dictate paying little possible labour. options ""get paid minimum wage treated disposable labour, go social assistance"", motivation join workforce?

The entire idea ""people need work"" completely based concept shareholders need maximise ROI. IMO danger Halloween clubs, bars, block parties occurring adults, well everyone house parties. I‚Äôm conservative virus would encourage trick treating, brief 10-20 second interaction hopefully wearing masks outdoors way lower risk pole things happening night. Attacking first responders anytime criminal.


Odds responding something, someone thought emergency. Deaths lag. Morons like spent couple months carpet bombing sub ""Why deaths down?"" US deaths surged cases up. Makes sense since data wildly inaccurate. probably classify ""losers suckers"" too, along veterans. living life. Without fear. US American living Germany works hotel that's run US Armed Forces. recent vacation apparently another European country US.  
So someone living Germany happens US citizen. Ill $24 hour appreciate actually trying support claims shouldn‚Äôt trust data. everything I‚Äôve read seems like small data issue changing systems way taken care now. *Even* better paused middle global pandemic check safety. come every week remind read sub anymore. I‚Äôm starting believe people prefer totalitarianism form leadership. call oven cold food hot eat food right Sweden abandoned herd immunity strategy quite early without acknowledge ever aimed herd immunity (which did).

Now Sweden ten times many dead neighbours lot people Covid persistent problem. LA already cancelled trick treating. I'm guessing major cities follow. 

Honestly, think trick treating biggest risk. outdoors like spend seconds interacting. masks, hand sanitizer, maybe even letting candy sit days, sounds pretty safe.

But Halloween parties going big threat. Drunken people congregating indoors recipe disaster, there's much done stop it. No.

Would 'herd immunity' strategy work HIV? many kilometres 65 miles? No, I‚Äôm not. US government is. care, they've never cared, coming woodwork, speak; conservatives around world making blatantly obvious care NOTHING lives money, specifically money themselves. Like said produce fine still like seeing I'm buying, sorting systems still help that.

Almost million people died *outside* flu season. deadly objectively. 

It means particular virus killing people listen people stop killing more. 

Yes, want save grandpa global pandemic could kill him. economy person, sympathy misplaced. Yeah. want exactly that. Great reading comprehension. I'm impressed. cousin mother went wedding shower 2 pregnant women. social distancing course (I guess outdoors). 

They freaking couple months ago father got covid going die. feeling guilty keep going out. Yeah, know. seems like fitting send-off time country. would support forcing everyone take public transit banning motorcycles autonomous cars developed rolled out? course even public transit fatality involved, would support 10mph speed limits well banning non-essential trips? level acceptable death feel would ok avoid situation?

I arguing people die traffic accidents covid. Although life-years lost actually much closer figure simple count people died. trying find much death find acceptable. Lol probably European Asian, actually take trains form transit instead luxury like north America. said March 2021 back December. thought generous. interesting that

1) interview touting new *home workout* program.

2) got COVID getting hair done, gym. Oh sweaty university 50,000 students, faculty, staff. 30,000 undergraduate students.

Freshmen (first-years) required live dorms, single small room two people share. larger freshmen dorms hold almost 1,000 people. Bathrooms communal shared around 40 people.

Downtown pretty packed maskless weekends despite last-call moved 2am 11:30pm many off-campus parties documented. 

About 25% undergraduates involved sororities fraternities, known huge parties frequent socials, officially events ended socially distanced many people minimizing role organizations spread COVID-19 UGA, there's evidence suggest least holding ""secret socials"" taking socially-distanced pictures IG otherwise continuing normal.

So pieces disaster there, top COVID-19 testing completely voluntary, reporting positive COVID-19 result university ""required"" there's system place enforce consequences (and many testimonies people whose friends gone off-campus get tested avoid reporting positive result bothered get tested want go hassle isolation housing returning home), isolation housing apparently full anyway, lecturers professors allowed inform students classes another student reports positive result classes ""socially-distanced"" UGA operating belief magical barrier exists 6 feet virus can't penetrate.

We 1,400 positives week university's primary concern keeping things normal get away (and they're getting away it) keep $$$ rolling in, even puts entire community danger. No, Reddit doesn‚Äôt tell are. figured it‚Äôs trolls since I‚Äôll end arguing someone trying spread misinformation, I‚Äôll get notification new follower, sometimes they‚Äôre dumb enough go comment argue posts unrelated subreddits, keep coming months.

Gee, wonder there's nurse shortage?/s COVID deaths trending right along excess deaths though. numbers different, that‚Äôs can‚Äôt reasonably call increase suicides substance abuse deaths Covid. overlay excess deaths chart Covid deaths chart see following right step one another. im trapped family nobody cares wearing masks protecting anybody else. terribly scary I'm American, see it, sadly don't.

Strictly speaking go 14 days, realistically there's enforcement mechanism, arriving train probably instructed fill forms like people direct flights restricted list (which believe use text reminders quarantine). get home continue play safe avoid unnecessary activities put close proximity people, especially indoors. go grocery store, try limit number trips take (which anyways), go walk run outside, sit park read want, wear mask stay away others, maybe hold going dinner friends little while, takeaway rather eating (even though eating restaurants safe). need tested, careful. Remember, fear people bringing COVID-19 states great deal virus activity, still risk catching someone NYC still take precautions even expected quarantine. that's thing, infections ""creeping peak first wave"". 

Pretty much everywhere world early ""first wave"" catching higher percentage cases beginning pandemic, due better testing/tracing. comparable flu season.

Yup, climate change here. Time tell. far headed generally right direction many months things opening up. don‚Äôt see reason reverse. course China making shit up, that‚Äôs debate. It‚Äôs rest nonsense thats problem. 

I‚Äôm done, go business, see gets you. Following personal attack mask lack arguments.

Maybe chill rhetoric bit. Whoa. I'm getting downvoted? Lol. Ive totally misunderstood. 

Bolsonaro foolishly called hoax many months beginning. I'm saying I'm glad got calling hoax make vaccine.

I definitely think hoax. all. Ever. since January. Either way, know hospitals going overwhelmed even though silver bullet/magic cure, significant strides treatments made odds dying COVID much slimmer March April.

Also 8 month old infected parents  expect ? lock months, people might avoid Covid instead starve death. Seems like Latin America reeling hard

Also, according article Colombia ended 5 months lockdown beginning Sept. hopefully manage coronavirus accordingly! comical point. Early September cancelling spring break.

But instead stuck zone maximizes death, misery economic crisis. Sept 11  Grow stop stalking people. Says guy get triggered post women. Get therapy bitterness towards women. Maybe life miserable. better france, comparable. 

Economically though much obviously thats comparing sweden countries pretty harsh lockdowns like belgium peru. opinion tape isn‚Äôt reality. Wow üòÑ

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre position questioning people‚Äôs take reality mate. feel sorry though, must horrible, lonely existence believing things do. hope one day come senses, sake people around you. mom tells fault want take accountability. going end great kids. really.

Kids likely die flu Covid, even though vaccinate frail kids flu. lose 12 kids per year flu, we've lost five Covid.

We've already bulk population going get infected well. tail end outbreak now. second wave going fraction original, short-lived.

There's reason media focused cases deaths hospital admissions. barely shifted even though number cases shot up. 

This Covid tests handed bulk now. We're detecting kinds cases we'd missed two months ago. I'm done since sold Amazon. It‚Äôs incredible people cherry-pick one part approach say that.

No doubt bold, really hard move everyone would benefited trying get close (see Australia) single nation, isolated strong health &amp; support programs, relative economic standing mattered getting end result. Preach it! Amen!! Well said!!  makes sound like expect pandemic go Spring, classes ""Spring Semester"" starts January certainly over, headline dramatic may appear. Uh oh, hopefully one tells Skip Bayless confirm. Source: me. Mom, age 40. 3 small kids, home, daycare. Well yes that's kind point. People 25 likely car accident. mean bad drivers go whole lives never accident. insurance company still going charge everyone group higher rate.

When turn 26 magically better driver get lower insurance rate

I guess statistics cool that's kind works. 

What tell walk restaurant full strangers pandemic know people everyone taking risk staying home (including me). risk likely uneccssay. necessary one like going work .

If you‚Äôre single individual starting making $57k year external support (e.g. shared family home etc.) need home. landlords require make 40x rent annually order qualify apartment. means $1400 month - good luck finding decent apartment price (pre-covid). $57k, take home per month probably around $2400. that‚Äôs $1k month left monthly metro card, electric, phone bill, Internet, cable, food, additional basic living expenses, plus banking away savings. teachers know pay pockets supplies. factor obscenely expensive everything NYC is.

**How cell phones spring breakers flouted coronavirus warnings kids wearing masks? hurt you? dismiss women's issues (which post) masculinity fragile pathetic. I'd like point largely result mass testing, spring.

Of look hospital admissions deaths, still around ten deaths day.

The recent estimate IFR UK 0.3%, that's based seroprevalence studies know massively undercount number infected.

Mortality likely 0.2% lower, places thorough testing hitting 0.15%.

If multiply number dead 500 (0.2%), get third population recovered least strongly resistant immune meaningful length time we've seen dozen cases reinfection, cell responses look good.

Sweden locked around nearly number deaths per capita, admissions deaths wanting away.

Sweden 573 per million

UK 625 per million (higher dark skinned population vulnerable Covid).

In fact everyone seems stabilizing high five hundreds low six hundreds, matter did.

Even open back fully second wave minimal compared first. Nowhere near number people carry it, herd immunity could easily significantly lower we'd expect cross immunity coronaviruses, undercount insensitive antibody tests. That's part problem.

It thrills food style magazines monopoly words like _tantalizing_ _surprise_.

So, 23 new proteins total 52. evidence inactivated virus vaccines (like Sinopharm) (I believe) contain multiple proteins work better vaccine based single protein (like Moderna Oxfords focus spike protein)?

Obviously know sure coronavirus vaccines have, general research say? hope realize adrenochrome really thing need scare kill children for. 

 really Wonder hormone. manufactured easily labs pretty cheap. Hell buy Amazon.

The conspiracy going years now, honestly,it makes sense. 

I would really ask kindly think life remove cult Q Anon Alex Jones. rude. never hindsight, I'm happy prepared adequately. Even end going crazy continue doing, hurt keep stocked essentials.

Yeah sometimes wish would selfish people tend present me.  doubt delay results much. probably already good data South Africa Brazil Yes...sarcasm. Scabs, mostly. predict post vaccination mask-burning parties thing. Something commemorate end awful ordeal. seen back house staff doing. Taking masks customers aren‚Äôt watching . well going work COVID positive management tells don‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs business put mask on. yeah reheat food cook home. wear mask. social distance. Drink bars. Masks exist traffic children, left pedos. must really dense understand said. Please google definition per capita clearly know said. 

People make statistics know countries different populations different results different populations. thing called per capita something takes differences population account. Based even take population difference account US still severely preforming. 

If trying say 300 million people lot cant managed properly, that's even worse argument. ever country expected able take care citizens, government cannot even country then. 

The European union China, areas larger populations US successfully brought cases control. right nullifies point again. 

Please read: nothing US 300 million people. Stop saying that. 99% chance death. feels like US trial Oxford vaccine almost little gratuitous

I guess racial diversity might also reason. many Asians Brazil South Africa, always good make sure vaccine react different different races.  consider USA one country? Weird. So, back then, friend Taiwan chatting it. watch youtube channel likes shit China circumvent censorship tell world really going there. distant rumblings stupid contagious sickness going on, working airport thought relevant tell me. people downvoting this? *novel* virus, quite literally don‚Äôt know long-term effects yet. guess based similar viruses, won‚Äôt actually know time passes. Definitely Nov 3rd. Well, team whether trial continues, Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) UK government, they're extremely vigilant. trials validation vaccine open strongly regulated that's standard practice case also build preserve public trust there's much misinformation speculation there. Taiwan international travel China Canada. travel ban people Wuhan, others free travel Taiwan. dispense lower travel claim.

""Most deaths occurred nursing homes"". That's probably true, 3574 people age 60 died Canada. many nursing homes, perhaps none. even compare 7 Taiwan 3500 Canada still even close. talking deaths point, infections. Taiwan infection rate Canada old age people home would statistically probability whether old age home home. fact, controlled entered old age homes would easy way prevent infection entering. late. 

""Any country low nursing home commitment rates would much lower death rates."" need back fact, otherwise speculation. reality compare countries experience Sars related infections see did. Canada report experience Sars recommendations followed. Taiwan reviewed handling Sars follow report recommendations. 

The reality 9000 deaths preventable. know full well populated (highest density) areas infections rates highest. Taiwan's population density makes even highest population density look trivial. compare Taipei Toronto far population density, Taipei twice Toronto total populatoin roughly 2.6 2.9 million people.

So 9000 deaths preventable. god's sake, told masks made difference. That's close criminal. Lol figured much problem! someone who‚Äôs similarly frustrating interactions extremely stubborn dad, lol, I‚Äôm chat pass resources (if he‚Äôs willing) anytime. would ask doctor, would presume get again, get yearly. think mean higher risk getting Covid dine side eat food people eating food leaves open getting Corona virus saliva transmitted air dining out.I eat car never dine wear two cloth masks. 20-30yos would stop dominant group testing positive C19, stop calling it. 

They blame less responsible for. Facts. hair always looks great. probably 45% reason elected exports 45% swedens GDP neighbors locked down. declined 8.9% beats much eurozone second this. don‚Äôt see hard redditors grasp. Covid pretty mild compared shit like Black Death whatnot. moved that, we‚Äôre going move one. loop happened? ones won‚Äôt medical resources handle inevitable COVID outbreak caused American tourists :( I'm signed trial US. I'm waiting call come get shot. I'm excited UK trail resuming hope resumes States soon too.

It pays $150/visit. 2 shots month apart. follow ups blood work next 2 years.

2 3 get vaccine 3rd get placebo.  care?  Worry problems. possible too. I'm hoping feel like looking good EUA high risk workers, going trial breadth general public authorization. looks like targeting safety data different groups vs enrolling types people  subtitles read?  even 500 coronavirus deaths whole country among people 24 younger.  no. don‚Äôt need wait 2-3 weeks.  saying. said 60k people like yay! said 200k Nov. people like boo!

Now they're saying 400k Jan 1st people like boo! 

Their model right appears factor easing restrictions insufficient mask usage. 

We'll see. that‚Äôs case, think everyone forget move lives. Remember millennia plagues pandemics ended without vaccines.  question, traveling quarantine period 2 weeks? Say get exposed flight home. takes 10 days disease incubate. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm asymptomatic, another 2 weeks it‚Äôs still possible spread disease. Wouldn‚Äôt 2 week quarantine useless Millennia human history would suggest otherwise. Trump's fault Wanted compare US second, per capita... remembered 0 times anything still 0.

Nice work, Canada. Keep up. 2023?? you, kind sociopathic grandma-killer? 2030 EARLIEST. take chances? wanna 100% sure SAFE. U.S. deaths related Covid-19 increased 1,215 Friday, making deadliest day since Aug. 26, according data compiled Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg.

I'm saying apocalypse. 

I'm saying things *are going change significant ways* redefine everything consider ""normal."" get it, people downvoting saying Uyghur holocaust happening, big deal? Yes can. ask Ebola survivor. that's like, opinion man bars open month Florida. went got food licenses.  bar drinking going month Florida. bars around got food license wide open. really. He‚Äôs stating herd immunity probably year away. Surely that‚Äôs considered fearmongering. thought things already went back normal Easter? Winter coming ... European country experienced entire autumn / winter season coronavirus. looks like things going get ugly starts get cold ... lockdown completely drained continent autumn came. find study share it, exactly fake news spread got big mess. Everybody heard read something somewhere repeats it. study might peer reviewed valid, posting better idea. Funny thing weekends unemployed mean quite much. quickly things ""return normal"" Flu 1918? Netter versuch okay, admit kiss homies cheek. safe space mum reinfection hospital England. guy Covid admitted March... again, hospital. 

I know anecdotes hard build real picture on, definitely happening seen anything news all. kids school making get tested diarrhea one night. either gets tested waits two weeks go back. There‚Äôs chance it‚Äôs people getting tested things wouldn‚Äôt normally go for. even mind feel people taking less seriously overall. like article clearly states limitations study, help readers interpret results. reported decrease physical activity within two-weeks start stay-at-home orders perceived higher level stress anxiety, expected. surprisingly, many respondents increased physical activity felt way.

Exercise put money bank account. stress stays twin pairs differed perceived change physical activity--when one twin reported decreased activity remained same--did differ perceived stress levels.

Exercise short term solution large problem comes pandemic life. Maybe semi-permanence. Treat permanent know isn‚Äôt forever. think back March we‚Äôre presented issue characters LOST dealt (or Swiss Family Robinson). stay beach keep eye planes ships expense worse shelter less protection heat less fresh water? go deeper island resources plenty, better shelter possible, risk seeing plane/ship lowers chance getting rescued? 

The answer little think. chose go island acclimate. I‚Äôm glad stayed beach. EU got SOOOO lazy. WEE WOO WEE WOO COMES US BAD POLICE

DON'T SCROLL PAST WITHOUT SAYING SOEMTHING US WORST

THANK mean, fair, larger proportion asymptomatic cases country (as far know). actually working us right now, chat friend said friends got covid nothing happened them, he's taking many precautions covid. really think going last forever? Even don‚Äôt get vaccine, permanent state affairs. 

Vaccine not, eventually people tire worrying corona get lives people need eat, socialize, live regular life. one 4,5, 10 years, even absolutely nothing changes today treatments vaccines become available. Everyone breaking point. current rates 1k deaths per day 111 days left year, expect least 300k deaths year really honestly depends. Like, someone sneezes wearing mask vs not, mask still offers protection. 

My state strict mask regulations, supposed wear anytime away home. Honestly surprised though. Paris, far cry used terms safety refugee crisis started. Cannot turn blind eye longer. parts Southern france actually safe. matter nice try be. worth risk given cime actually ""certain areas"". Also, summary end video? put hold US well. (I appointment join study rescheduled) order get average high need something around double peak numbers December. April NYC sending sick people back old folks homes 2,000 deaths per day average...yeah going double that. levels Vitamin high enough, supplements decrease admission rate might dangerous much vitamin toxic. yes title misleading. Right headline misleading previously stated. know what's article.

You could easily say healthy practice XXX reduces COVID chances wrong misleading state like somehow decreases risk used outside normal practice. point based pandemic people like try compare to, surprised going last months. Yes, seems spreading uncontrollably Europe past week. Good thing leaders BC strictly mandating masks

/s title correct!

If levels Vitamin high enough, supplements decrease admission rate might dangerous much vitamin toxic. People sub pay WAY much attention models use reinforce doomsday outlook. also think Fauci gets little much hype little fear-mongery (the man wrong several occasions). that‚Äôs say don‚Äôt think great voice reason people country.

But many great voices best field get drowned out. Dr Osterholm, well several prestigious epidemiologists, shouting rooftops since late spring take models gospel. Osterholm especially skeptical consistently points inherent issues weekly podcasts. hysteria opposite side pandemic coin harmful conspiracy nuts. Great point IHME model predicts 2,308 COVID-19 deaths Alabama   Strange how, fewer people tested, [fewer cases reported pretty sure Florida successfully thwarted instances covid, statewide. Pakistan far better India. place running oxygen. guess too... like OP said: ""you put racism somewhere else "", like, lines.


So conclude: people born Sweden dual nationality throw bricks ambulances.

*China entered chat* Even someone able get sick, vaccines tend reduce severity. 

The real question happens starts mutating like cold Saturday update:

New covid-19 deaths, States: countries above: 420 United States: 328 million That's shitty. Bars near let unless wearing mask, serve come bar without one on, allowed leave table without wearing one. Whatever do, read article links associated within it. might faced empirical evidence contrary beliefs world view, clear may unprepared situation. counts mask? like blue medical ones couple nice mask/necktube/bandana kinda thing outdoor sports thinking using mask.   one community US know 20 percent antibodies New York.

Oregon Vit deficient. rarely need sunscreen. even think house. walk least hour day (sometimes two) woefully deficient since moved 30 years ago. 


So interesting COVID numbers low Oregon. production thing top level comment.

It's storage transport thing.

But think massively overblown issue reddit.

Pfizer requiring -94F initial storage transport. point vaccination, require either -4F refrigerated. 

I high degree confidence able get together transportation capabilities get vaccine hospitals/clinics/etc. 50-60% seems current common estimate. could see accepting lower that. They're going say outright right now, vaccine goal always least 50% effective. could see scenarios accept 30-40% safe work with.

The data okay, determined pretty safe, efficacy determined humans yet. Pfizer vaccine Chinese vaccines look promising ones phase III. appear hitting right goals preventing combo retransmission severe disease. highly doubt first wave vaccines hit 70%. would huge success pace they've working at.

Oxford would actually one would guess falls 50% do. monkey trials prevented severe disease retransmission. seems like ""safe bet"" me, doubts effective frontrunners.

Edit: Oxford also *possible* snafu could occur patients immunity deactivated cold virus they're using. certain, small, minimal chance could prevent vaccine effective people.  probably is... remove mask ride bus, eat. Masks help protect others you. I‚Äôll raise you. Based solely user name, amount lives lost acceptable deal racism US? amount financial social inequality ok with? Obviously rhetorical. Better would start.

Covid wimp average person long avoid crowds, stay away people, wear mask, wash hands. implemented ways stay safe. roommates policy allow friends/family. said, 2/4 roommates aren‚Äôt lucky. go work days. That‚Äôs obviously great, can‚Äôt control risk. trust they‚Äôre trying same.

I don‚Äôt number you. I‚Äôve numb since 50,000. We‚Äôve lower rates (500/day) higher rates (2000/day). get us wear masks we‚Äôre house. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening, least am.

What simple things think reduce car deaths? Drive less one. bonus save gas. walk grocery store exercise. disagree extent, would vaccination given massive portion population quickly. Damn well better safe.

Maybe, be. Emergency authorizations exist limited scope.

We know virus considerably deadly elderly kids, example. elderly, truly terrifying - roughly half nearly 200,000 US deaths happened nursing homes long term care facilities, despite fact facilities house 0.6% population. kids, even bad seasonal flu. There's well 100 deaths.

Logically then, make sense apply degree risk aversion both. example, let's assume vaccine outright kills 1 100 people take (way worse conceivable, assume sake argument). would never give every child. losses close make lives saved. might still give nursing home residents though. 5% already died people saying another 200,000 people die end year. 1% die save 5%. course would that. average 2 deaths day. stand corrected. sucks.  50? wouldn‚Äôt surprised 50,000. Depending definition ‚Äúpopular‚Äù. (I personally avoid chain restaurants.)

In best times, restaurants high rate failure. among worst times.

I know getting hung phrase, bothered read thread see came from. problem context quote? said know, still don't, shed bit light either. also really sad US can't even stop first wave. disagree this.

Schools clearly spread it. Nah, bang. Yeah remember number months ago mentioned September, wonder October realistic timeframe? Curious source it‚Äôs generally advised include source meterics Bunch dip shit people FB demanding NC schools reopen person classes.
I get importance person learning, majority FB nuts get increase cases, reopen would cause.
I feel close vaccine, people self centered wait. turns she‚Äôs German? press always this. moment see change write article. fact weekend reporting usually slowed. Next week, midweek, rebound reporting resumes. Additionally, 3190 cases *up*, *down*. said compared *July*. Another attempt make things look better. Keep eyes numbers 2 weeks. Labor day opening ""in-bar"" drinking cause rise. STAT first reported patient developed symptoms consistent transverse myelitis (TM), that‚Äôs you‚Äôre asking; NYT carried that. First, I'll clarify Sweden disease control agency decides recommendations. opted recommend masks based argument stated. absolutely *nothing* they're saying anything selfish whatever spouting. thus *no* actual opposition masks among people general here. want wear mask that. anti-mask protests.

Seatbelts really comparison scientifically proven work. People need drive, seatbelts really minor issue, comparable.

Masks, though, could lead things like people assuming mask protects better really does, thereby behaving recklessly. going bigger events, relaxed less careful. ü§û Highly doubtful kind test widely available Thanksgiving Christmas 2020. would nice, think already late. Covid can‚Äôt see you‚Äôre invisible. That's another thing forgot mention. Mandatory masks public buildings transit, see people wearing masks lot around city. Everyone taking seriously shows. feel like certain part world slightly south us, there'd even riots masks made mandatory... Canada always kind. (: Let try idea here. spoken moral values. would suggest conscience lack conscience. one strongly developed conscience protect others, likely adhere promote protections covid-19. 

The problem born conscience. develop conscience parents, teachers, education. People conscience feel badly others damaged covid-19 necessary experiences fully formed conscience. think idea? TIA newer articles say opposite: ""Counties higher urban densities far higher percentage COVID-19 really need watch video become bit informed actually works: video digs exact topic, catastrophic release vaccine early. already taking risks wanting us take releasing vaccine make early 2021, already going ""well, slightly risky crapshoot putting soon, worth risk"" putting current time estimates. rushing, right now, already. goal release something 99% sure going kill damaging virus (but could still damaging), least efficacy. 2021 long takes actually get point, max possible speed.

If throw whatever candidates right now, it'd rolling dice could easily kill (yes, kill) many people, more, covid. It'd equivalent trying inject random shit read homeopathy Reddits rid bad karma giving virus. taking vaccine feel better rather actually preventing anything. huge waste limited resources lives would be. I‚Äôm Olive Garden tonight. parents house. I'll put money Fauci random dude Reddit.

No offense, opinions (I'm including here) utterly worthless.  need stop trust trump. common thread. one directing anything said isn‚Äôt valid.

Look familiar. Released quickly geographies paid price. 

The process followed place reason. addition everything said awful enough news broke yesterday: 

The Treasury Department withheld roughly $3.7 million New York City Fire Department‚Äôs (FDNY) fund 9/11 first responders.

The program established James Zadroga 9/11 Health Compensation Act passed Congress 2010. newspaper reported Thursday four years ago Treasury Department began withholding payments FDNY‚Äôs World Trade Center Health Program without giving explicit explanation.¬†

‚ÄúThis disappearing,‚Äù program‚Äôs director, David Prezant, told News. ‚ÄúThis amazing thing. disappearing ‚Äî without absolutely help healthcare program funds removed past four years tune 4 million. money taken past year pretty much Covid-19. That‚Äôs generous. I‚Äôd say 2022 least told several friends family members I'm signing vaccine trials. Every. Single. One. thinks dangerous... say it, half told it.

&amp;#x200B;

I work high risk environment Covid exposure. 2 people saying get immuno-compromised whine moan want things go back normal want scared etc.

&amp;#x200B;

And like.. TF think get there? sitting house crying? Truth is, even need vaccine. I'm confident treatments we've discovered, health, precautions, habits. need it. still riskier things do. scared it. mind-blowingly ignorant inconsistent. I'm sure country live US press refer AstraZeneca vaccine AZ running trials US Oxford involved - unlike UK, Brazil SA studies. Yeah agree shit going stay 2022 sure. Reason went back school Master‚Äôs degree, world going nowhere What‚Äôs conclusion *how much* contribute spread? spread wasn‚Äôt exactly debate, earlier studies e.g Sweden/Finland suggested spread among children schools wasn‚Äôt significant factor overall spread. 1 million day past 2 weeks ah yes. staying put bunch travelers. Brilliant strategy. headline feels misleading Also, 3 days believe reference governor released public. would take longer 3 days gather data also don‚Äôt get rate cases per day.

Edit include statewide data; total 558 outbreaks, 189 considered active, accounting total 11,253 cases 312 death‚Äù loopholes. Indeed, **official election rigging**

- Gerrymandering
- Voter registration
- (SUPER) PAC's
- Electoral College.

Hey fucking Americans **see pattern emerge?**  (moreso when) vaccines effect enough, effect hamper community spread. vaccines for. scared stupid thought parts India literally oxygen CO floating air pockets CO floatin What? Pfizer vaccine created neutralizing antibodies Phase 2 trials levels found patients recovered covid... 
  Based second chart, question number cases. Based fourth chart, though, US quite caught Europe deaths, soon: Germany literally looked US inspiration. Look fanboy thread would rather sign waiver risk 1/1000 chance getting transverse myelitis could take Oxford vaccine, truly comical level brand loyalty.

I would really like one fanboys explain makes Oxford brand vaccine worthy devotion. use secret sauce missing Adenovirus vectors Sputnik V Ad5-nCoV? Phase 1/2 results much impressive vaccines? track record delivering effective vaccines using platform?

Unfortunately, suspect, failures US/UK response manifestation blind nationalism. probably ruined every americans chance travel Germany forseeable future. know people...most doubters bought 'its fake' 'its like flu' hype enough first hand experience believe otherwise.

Pure number increases alone change people's minds stupid that. identified clusters associated religious gatherings Faith Chapel Assembly God Louisburg (21), Faith Tabernacle Apostolic Church Junction City (7), Hannah‚Äôs House Independence (9) Plevna Church Plevna (14). 2021 seems overly optimistic me.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* goes mouth first, yes? thing mucous membranes. cant even read nonsense anymore people. nice weekend im out. Anyone else notice things good smooth headlines Oxford vaccine got little bumpy suddenly AstraZeneca vaccine, makes one wonder. TBH surprised found vaccine happened week lol.  Ron‚Äôa DeathSentence False logic. exceptions hospitals run. all, curves held steady slope magnitude adjusted population population density regardless mandates posted state. pace US going, pandemic begin slow naturally end year US, due fact amount people then. That‚Äôs great. Hopefully something similar occurs states Especially rich hoarding money they'll never spend multiple lifetimes. People like, obviously. widespread transmission highly dangerous virus definitely normal. Yeah... ignore data Sweden entirely! course. fact diseases different make difference behavior. unreasonable different reactions situations different. 

With flu -- flu once, put me, generally healthy person, hospital. would never want give someone vulnerable. major difference -- flu get vaccinated (and do, every year). mitigating factor really big difference changes behavior. could get vaccinated COVID-19, would change things sure. 

Even cold, soon feel sick things I'm right - stay home, avoid public places group gatherings possible, wash sanitize frequently. difference cold last long. feel weather, easy enough stay home go anywhere feel better. half face respirator mask n95 fit way thinking general idea PhD biochemistry buddy. I've grown viruses (lentivirus) plasmid cloned I'm still willing admit I'm expert subject focus epigenetics. really PhD chemistry extremely aware takes expert field defer proper experts Yes, flu season ended abruptly Europe march Covid-19-related measures. kinda/sorta force people wear them, though. Canada super high buy-in rate can't go anywhere without one. like cities business picking/choosing whether necessary come indoors. Everywhere go, wearing god damn mask can't pay taxes, get dog license, go eat. cohesiveness since day one become norm. Ok I‚Äôll mark comment return three weeks see we‚Äôre at. Hint, they‚Äôll continue drop Come everyone, this! Stay home much possible, go out, mask keep distance. *""Let's this, marines!""* getting downvoted telling people handicap favorite vaccines. why. human immune system ultimately gets veto. aliens look like Scarlet Johansson. Incorrect.. 951 new cases per SCDHEC Welp, last high June, Ontario still Phase 1, Phase 3 + back school ""pause"" stay Phase 3

I'll never understand logic behind rolling back measures due said measure working, though they're afraid might accidentally kill virus off. hospitals remotely close overwhelmed... hmm. Looks like lot backlog clearing Richland county counties. things work. 

If ran clinical trial 5 250k serious effects.

If also ran clinical trial competing drug 4 15 serious effects would make sense say ""See drug way dangerous""?

The 2 bad flu pandemics 50s 60s killed 1-4 million. COVID-19 probably reach 1 million October.


That adjusted fact world population much larger. Even counties good lockdown seeing cases rise right now. simple. first surge all. Already reopening US. Shortened hospital stays could positive effect overall mortality though (as staff freed up). Bruh, claimed *time traveller* Trump would *take galaxy*, trying reprimand ""making zero sense""?

Are drunk? Length contact important. Even person shedding, unlikely, likely fine. Would rather bunch sick / dead teachers one teach kids bunch alive teachers delayed classes?? controversial? IMO NY online schooling instead mixed person classes since many schools underfunded crowded. Good teachers standing students. deserve way give them. never know.

Science research may may find answer actually. Yes statistics scientific proof 100% certain, things 'know' world basis numerous studies done 95% better conficence intervals. hard difference small (think weak signal, like something slightly carcinogenic), need many independent studies.

But virus turned patogenic lockdowns border closures made entire populations starve suffer malnurishment answer comes easier/sooner. today see won't. failed contain virus hallmarks genetic markers edited lab every advantage staying around foreseeable future.
Sorry understand that, childish bash someone open-minded enough listen others trained area expertise claim prognosis look good. people elderly moms South Carolina.

Like me. care whole damn lot. hyperbolic. They‚Äôre literal. in, social distancing thing isn‚Äôt going away disease thing getting worse.  want do, give reason care? address points...

1. think draconian enforcement mask laws way go. need availability BETTER masks. people wore N95s, matter Karen mask freedom. still wildly expensive half country believes exist ""for healthcare workers"", virus truly airborne, need.

2. Like right masks, even everyone gets vaccine, ENOUGH people do, spread much less significant. Forcing laws like sow distrust among American people... that's biggest problem right now.

3. address one I'm guessing agree it?

4. this, I'm honestly concerned ""free money"" run out, really something address midst this.

5. I'm pretty sure would next impossible prove, especially time contract tracing seems limited. like said, going get EVERYONE board it, going harsher penalties.

The problem we're we're told, we're told working.  Congrats expecting person capable rational risk analysis.

You real champ. Oh stop it. knew start would peaks troughs multiple waves. Going store mask low risk. things won‚Äôt go back normal long time full capacity stadiums, concerts, International travel vacation, large festivals gatherings. School won‚Äôt fully normal either (still lot online learning going on,) restaurants continue see lesser foot traffic.

Your anecdotes ‚Äúpeople already ignoring virus‚Äù doesn‚Äôt match data. large majority still socially distancing. split hairs marathon race. think mean sprint. throw surgical mask top valves respirator. 

We ‚Äòcoveted‚Äô $2 paper respirators actually protect wearer. That‚Äôs really burn virus out. high tech devices, despite media said avoid hoarding early on. 

In Asia, majority masks public wear particulate filtration protect wearer. North America opted become new 3rd world comes utilizing right tools stomp thing out. mean, personally care health safety others,

Pure, uncut virtue right folks. Muricans hate one simple truth:

Germans smarter less egoistic average. LolüòÇüòÇüòÇ want work, instead want spend time protesting, rioting looting shops waiting next stimulus money. I'm America. American presidents throw toys pram, rest world deal fallout pick pieces.

I'm also great fan Biden, given he's alternative dangerous incompetent incumbent... he'll suffice.

America needs sweeping political reform, country. Ph. chemistry, nobody losers like stop acting like arbiters science? Can't wear cloth mask it? Don‚Äôt forget racists nazis. proudly parading streets that‚Äôs thing. think probably switching groups kids, doesn‚Äôt help kids within class spreading back home. realize think kind fake bullshit

Their entire comment suggests exact opposite. illiterate close-minded lash straw-men? really interesting CDC study comparing covid-positives covid-negatives presented. Restaurants came back really badly survey headlines written. point comparison, [what CNN significant differences tested positive versus negative came shopping, gathering fewer 10 people home, going office, going gym, going salon, using public transportation attending religious gatherings, according study. 

That's fine far goes [CDC also covers home gatherings larger 10 people, point CNN significant differences observed bivariate analysis case-patients control-participants shopping; gatherings ‚â§10 persons home; going office setting; going salon; **gatherings persons home**; going gym; using public transportation; going bar/coffee shop; attending church/religious gathering. 

Also interesting qualitative difference restaurants infected vs control groups.

So, small sample, see spread churches, gyms, salons, household gatherings (any size), offices, public transit.

This part restaurants interesting:

**Restaurant: others following recommendations wearing face covering mask kind social distancing (n = 107)**  

||Sick #/%|Control #/%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|None/A |12 (19.0) |1 (2.3) |
|About half/Most |25 (39.7) |21 (47.7)  |
|Almost |26 (41.3) | 22 (50.0) |

I see questionnaire CDC doc hard say subjects asked. clearly infected group likely restaurants taking precautions. Given blurry lines restaurants bars, wonder many infected eating bars serve food. 1) they‚Äôre still wearing masks 

2) they‚Äôre still six feet apart

3) they‚Äôre literally flying air high speeds outdoors, best airflow imaginable

There absolutely nothing unsafe False. Check CDC tracking site. changed end August. US finds high % positives testing, indicating enough testing done real incidence must higher.  huge surge US cases still running strong. 

Containment outbreaks prevented test result delays. fixed next bottlenecks would rapid contact tracing capability, total test availability outbreaks carpet-bombed. 

Other national infrastructure needed public trust health leadership news media, trusted national leader. 

So, quite lot work do. Appreciate Innuendo Studios quote. Great channel. guess, thanks becoming meme? Idk ACHTUNG, STIELHANDGRANATE! matter? high need start caring?

You really embarrassed acting overtly foolish. changed least month. deaths dropped spread way count Georgia declining deaths take peak literally 8 days ago say less now. That's true, also true right beginning august worst deaths georgia.

in short high death plateau pandemic control Someone told day eventually we're going treat like flu, quick point kills lot people every year exhausting.

I like Josh allen tho we‚Äôve got better Harm reduction techniques now.  watched China numbers go 1000 2000 next day 4000 next day continually double till info stopped January. People thought crazy stocking food ammo late jan early February. Everyone calling crazy going overboard go fuck themselves. proper leadership thing probAbly would okay June. 

I cut one best friends years years wife changed phone number yelling face telling masks stealing freedoms kids can‚Äôt get it.  I‚Äôm nyc area btw. Fucking sick assholrs we'll never get vaccine vaccines carry risk. Even basic common vaccine flu shot millions get every year cause nervous system issues. you‚Äôre smart  know Guillan-Barre possible side effect annual flu vaccine right? Also plenty drugs market hundreds millions people take, drugs come possibility potentially deadly adverse reactions. mind blowing revelation persuasive argument! That‚Äôs interesting. Honestly expected kids culprit, guess staff members blame. Thanks study! OP stated 3 SINCE 1918 2x deadly. entire statement false. 1million dead worldwide end month, ones certified counting countless thousands died from.""comorbidities."" another topic altogether.

Population population, need adjust. people alive got virus died. then, today. Good! gone anywhere work market, double masked. (COV19 testing site). called Mom Jan. 31st broke news. laughed. 2 weeks later understood. ""Honey, scaring me!"" ""Good,"" said I. also detected China later time people saying it‚Äôs then? numbness unspeakable rage. I've careful, wearing masks, avoiding people. kids pissed us (spouse I) extra careful person person interactions, see friends normal things, get mad us. half people around us give crap, see plenty people bothering masks anymore. 

I wanna optimistic, I'm pretty sure many people die year, nothing say make difference. feel defeated. feel hopeless. 

My one kid high anxiety routinely says wishes could go hibernation six months however long shit show go on. try reassure things bad, internally I'm ""yeah, that's good plan any"".  Keep border closed. America paying high price letting Trump, GOP Fox Lies get away lethal lying. would need adjust deaths population growth? # people dead # dead. I'm sorry, probably shouldh careful generalizations Soutern Europe. Italy seems managing corona really well seeing spikes like Southern France, Spain much balkans (even still though, social movements tracked GPS data really great Lombardy locked IIRC). Sweden sure anyway... wonder stopped reddit's favorite country 6 months ago... states fine. It‚Äôs MSM causing fear. Clearly massive power grab follow money üí∞ Stay strong friend. try remember (the people) together. Everyone crazies staying home. pass. 

Either Biden wins done 6 months ago, trump wins virus goes nuts winter kills many nut jobs choice face reality. Credit what? takes responsibility gets credit. 99% people wear masks protect regardless say Totally understand. realise nice people, really, respect can't THINK. walk away. Exactly. vaccine approved enough efficacy take gamble.  issue virus slowly creeping onto older people. mostly 20-30 yo couple weeks ago, went older generations slowly. 10000 cases per day could manageable long protect elderly. 

Hospital capacities still fine. ICUs 6.8% lowest month ago, slowly going 9.4%. Yes white allowed Call black people n word public again, can‚Äôt tell isn‚Äôt real improvement advertised asked for. (Kinda Sarcasm Kinda Not) accurately, entire country see anything wrong. Clearly political system needs improved. Democrats Republicans showing shameful behavior emergency. Yes, would logical taking back she'd put in. that's social security works. Especially author every day worker. We've known wet market well adapted humans. means cryptic spread Wuhan that. wet market event set alarm, virus jumped animals humans.  want eradicate virus. 50% ""soon"" have. That's good first step. guy wrong.

Very broadly speaking, stage 1 establishing safety efficacy ranges humans, stage 2 determining best dose amount least side effects, stage 3 monitoring mid-term safeness general efficacy broad range testing subjects (healthy vs risk, things nature).

Each stage significant overlap stages, focus different one.

There‚Äôs also stage 4 long term safety studies, practice stage 4 often overlaps controlled release (like tens hundred thousand people get it) drug. Stage 4 doesn‚Äôt usually apply vaccines, though always exceptions. RIP -_- COVID worse people think flu spread it. massive anti mask rally Canada? Unlike dumb ass president (US), understand population infection rate guys still better there. American British spelling judgment? dont open large portion parents arent going pay tuition online learning. opening survive. predicting cases rise weather gets shittier US. People becoming complacent, cold weather force people inside. knows it'll follow model states, think least uptick cases winter northern hemisphere. average patient began displaying symptoms virus, false-negative rate 38%. 

My comment: ""we're talking 38% false negative even symptoms""

""After symptoms"" includes ""day symptom onset"" me, either way, numbers would practically thing 20% _three days_ average symptom onset They‚Äôve edited again. She‚Äôs American, ‚Äûtourist‚Äú. She‚Äôs Amis traveled recently.  anti-vaxxers necessarily claim vaccines successful. long-term side-effects (if any). Folks scared shitless, yeah. Taiwan hand 7 deaths population 23 million high population density, Canada 9000 deaths population 38 million second largest land mass world. Oh great. also shutdown economy even ban travel China. gives? 

You know fed propaganda compare country worse country, always someone worse off. Compare best follow example. ""It could worse vs. make better"" watch parking lots lot people refuse wear masks. many cars lot, dont ho God given right refuse read anything! should. remember reading DGCI (Indian regulator) required Serum Inst. provide NOC sort issued UK Govt.  
  
Edit: [It American here, sorry, too. 

However, I've learned anything past four years pandemic, Americans shitty. Honestly, heartbreaking bit comes bit condescending 
I know lot people believe have/had loving, caring, affectionate, devoted parents, wrong. That‚Äôs parents. 

Pump brakes their, pal.

Feel free downvote oblivion.  IHME still stupid curve fitting problems? I'm over-optimist this, mean continue treat IHME gold standard model accurate. you‚Äôre still wrong. says 20% case entire world. COVID contagious eliminated, even spread cases stopped stuff like mask wearing social distancing alone. there‚Äôs effective vaccine try slow spread much possible.

Australia success story Melbourne spiked many daily new cases Canada experiencing today. Fair enough, read commentary implied neither Pfizer AZD would likely provide sterilizing immunity based Phase II implications, would essentially reduce symptoms common cold. macaques cases dosed huge amounts virus fine. inevitable, actually surprising US hasnt lost leading position yet.

Guess know US healthcare actually level India focus saving lives you‚Äôre going enjoy life itself? bad side effects 50% valuable start. Keep working 50% Maybe looks like transmission done asymptomatic carriers look them? know, suppose they'll review data check ok, see evolution, give us new answer. We're still learning virus, hold hard previous study unless new one crappy. article states indeed American, tourist residing Germany among military community.

Among them, less demand fewer people symptomatic disease. Yeah, case growth. city like 6 cases total, last week, added 45 one day, like 80 cases now.  days weren‚Äôt they? Depriving children education/socialization worse potentially giving disease doesn‚Äôt kill statistically significant level. It‚Äôs perfect it‚Äôs definitely best interested Brazilian excess deaths, website. 109,833 August 1st. Well couple weeks ago US four states increasing cases, it‚Äôs back 22 schools colleges re-opening. Less familiar international goings-on though. Sweden much worse similar countries, did. Comparing Italy Spain like comparing New York Nebraska. course New York well traveled high density state much worse pandemic Nebraska. Italy Spain much denser populations much travel destinations Sweden, especially international travelers. Comparing countries similar gives better idea. Delayed maximum one week. likely initial information efficacy end October. Key word cases, tiny minority hospitalisation, many deaths last week...? Zero. reason going back lockdown economic destruction follow kill far people corona ever did. seems depend province in. medical schools virtually impossible get like UBC. Dalhousie much easier get told.

As programs going come many people applying competition like. know fact UBC many foreign students advanced degrees helped parents money (was told students likely true). probably see less Nova Scotia.

Personally put emphasis educating people stay Canada rather giving away seats people leave get MD. Hahajajahaha funny half-assed?? good flu vaccine years, definitely would major impact. Well, understand, saw far trailer movie. Let's hope stays way. study found positive negative cases reported going **gyms, hair salons, shops in-home group gatherings** rate. positive cases twice likely report **dining restaurants** within 14-day period feeling sick. 

So exactly contract ? ate 2x mean restaurant point contagion. indoor dining outdoor dining tested positive likely close contact someone known COVID-19 ‚Äî 42% compared 14% control group. **Of close contacts, 51% family members.**

Lies, damn lies, statistics.

As say, correlation found tested positive nearly three times likely report dining restaurant, **and** nearly four times likely report going **bar** **coffee shop**, 

So maybe going starbucks rather restaurants. part, much reasonably possible, are.

Problem that‚Äôs enough. That‚Äôs case numbers going literally everywhere, Canada, they‚Äôre going Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Europe, India, Brazil, etc. Even get cases 5-10 new cases day overall case numbers dropping lockdown, part Canada, numbers either slowly quickly creep back up. nobody planet rich enough keep lockdown going indefinitely, somebody needs leaving houses keep grocery stores stocked nothing else.

This disease (fortunately) lethal initially feared, extremely contagious, even draconian police state methods utilized China, quarantines people locked inside homes, failed contain it.

We stop kidding using hand sanitizer, wearing mask social distancing going stop it. slow spread. disease isn‚Äôt going anywhere effective vaccine, effective treatment both. People dying lockdown. Someone care explain someone want Vaccine safe ASAP? ootl happens November? finally it, made america great again. 

Now need vote make america great again. /s That's completely normal happens almost every week, regardless overall trend heading. Cases start slow week, build crescendo Friday. Point day even less previous day week. Another way saying 7 day rolling average going down. believe contract tracing general? pretty proven method going back long time. China entered chat. Excess deaths Brazil updated August 1st*. Since 30,000 deaths covid. maybe 10,000 disparity numbers, less 10%. 
I believe 'developed' countries can't say thing. Thank you, great perspective.  Says anti vaxxer üòÇ

What exactly, saying makes less Swedish? pregnancy thing it? Nobody knows long-term effects virus existed long term.

Why challenging innocuous statement? give credit contributing something. can't read it, children recovered say, glad them. can't know yet related problems future. wish best. pondered escape (dual citizen, EU passport), late. likely explanation. statement reads: ""No proof either way, decided continue now. Please ask questions, thin ice. Fingers crossed happen again."" US citizens still dumb af matter live. 

Source: US citizen. dumb. ...yes. case even onset researchers estimated tested SARS-CoV-2 four days infection 67% likely test negative, even virus. average patient began displaying symptoms virus, false-negative rate 38%. test performed best eight days infection (on average, three days symptom onset), even false negative rate 20%, meaning one five people virus negative test result. results important catch possible side effects, get enough statistics preventive effect vaccine.

So ideally would like nobody vaccine group get infected many control group. people test vaccine quicker probabilities pile up.

We're morons. many refuse keep locked somewhere safe. takes least six months to¬†produce¬†large quantities of¬†influenza really need watch video become bit informed actually works: 


You must really stupid think layman video teach anything drug approval procedure. chance completely tested vaccine harmful covid19 infection negligible say least. dumb video said 2/3 vaccines pass phase II trial safe effective. That's good enough. stop wasting time start saving people. public trust vaccines, that's irrelevant. civilized place vaccination mandatory. population x percent achieve herd immunity. Even lowest estimates 20% would mean India needs least 200m cases.  half might needed see slowdown effect. US surge cases even 1% population infected, means possible India 10m+ cases still INCREASE cases, opposite slowdown. understanding substantial number private school parents demanded reopen vs. NTI, (and would) get NTI free public schools. So, private schools reopened prevent mass exodus students keep tuition money flowing. So, yes, money. Yes, exactly. think take months hit heard immunity Holy shit dude, don‚Äôt know. genuine question. problem solution prevent unnecessary deaths pandemic infected spread infection two weeks realizing it?

Do agree know virus spread someone else violated rights?

If someone knows virus spread you, violated rights? know it, result same, got sick potentially crippling deadly disease.

Is contact tracing invasion rights?

Is testing frequently violation rights?

You've already said wearing mask violation.

Is social distancing violation?

What tools government use violate rights control spread fairly lethal virus? let run course? acceptable lose 100's thousands millions lives? don‚Äôt believe ever thought buying food Amazon though. Whole Foods better-than-average grocery store within blocks. Covid hit, haven‚Äôt either one since (I‚Äôm high risk).

Even ended magically tomorrow, I‚Äôd still continue buy lot online. discovered great products love.

My guess settles down, brick-and-mortar grocery stores need feature things like choose person: meat, fresh fish, produce, make worth trip. Anybody ever successfully lost lot weight went obese healthy probably experienced version this, especially family that's also obese. Spend time fitness/weightloss dieting subreddits see lots posts people ranting suddenly relatives people around complain criticize person eating living healthy. want acknowledge could change put work feel judged family member merely improving life.

We (meaning people) like confronting possibility wrong thing failing, feel threatened presence anybody posing reminder that. irrational, suspect human brain wired. don‚Äôt know sterilizing immunity humans yet, that‚Äôs point Phase 3 trials. know monkeys researchers intentionally exposed high doses virus. Challenge trials humans considered unethical. waiting right see people received various vaccines Phase 3 trials become infected. know sterilizing immunity. 
 
What know three leading vaccines produced strong immune responses Phase 2, even stronger people recover covid. People recovered covid seem generally protection reinfection (aside limited edge cases). vaccines produce even stronger immune response, expect confer sterilizing immunity humans. know sure Phase 3 data. true. 

I‚Äôm going back normal soon can. considered seeing friends outdoors? Face face friendship important mental health important

anyone says something like MASSIVE chode edit /s

Gave upvote cuz know sarcasing. Sarcasaming? Patience now. takes months, 2-3 general, nice big spike come opening up. new reporting late Friday revealed Trump political aides reviewing‚Äîand cases altering‚Äîweekly CDC reports

This distressing. institutions need primary target Trump officials' interference, according Politico, CDC's Morbidity Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR), crucial resource 

We can't fully trust information government allows us see. pretty sure tests accompanied database records results contact tracing.

But taking theoretical cheap rapid test buy take sporting events test that‚Äôs nearly instantaneous better solution. something right enter get results minutes.

That would ideal, something realistic? Rapid tests (for things) *sometimes* give pretty quick positive, still take minutes confirm negative.

Honestly, find family gatherings unlikely, possibly *more* unlikely people vigilant, honest, self testing. Part residual evolutionary tribalism, feel safer willing relax guard around family, part fact people either think big deal, outright deny exists, people completely self-centered think convenience enjoyment important people's safety... people family too. can't believe politicized masks lockdowns. can't believe politicized pandemic. you‚Äôre like reside Germany.

*‚ÄûDie Frau sei zwar US-Amerikanerin, wohne aber der Gemeinde und sei keine Urlauberin.‚Äú* Yes numbers fact lie. excess deaths could easily result lockdown restrictions well. word used ""if.""

 WW-II popular phrase: ""If ham, could ham eggs, eggs!""

I sure heck want work use ""in excess caution"" methodology, even certain gov people seem over-enthusiastic thumbs scale. 

But gotta go data ""best practices"" avoid unnecessary harm and/or true debacle. March 16 2020: Pakistan's president visited China amid early phases pandemic China express collaborated China fight COVID, took FULL advantage lessons learned Chinese health community. Temporary hospitals, converting large buildings alternate accomodations, systematic ranking symptomatic severity grouped isolation units, on. Retired medical staff Pakistan asked volunteer. Local committees formed Pakistan monitor residental areas, copy China 28th 2020 - Chinese medical aid sent Pakistan: Pakistan: Laisse tomber, il fait le meme blague depuis pls semaines sur tous les post qui parlent de la France (et mama mia s'il parle de l'Italie).

Il s'amuse le mec college students tested three times week checked news articles corona USA Sweden 10-14 August. see claiming. weren‚Äôt comparisons Sweden US. reporting US numbers infections deaths. objectively. 

Maybe it‚Äôs Reddit thing obsessed comparing countries naming winners losers? City, type work, time day, etc etc etc lots variables fast Chill bruh 'rona superspreaders come every nationality. Remember wealthy Italians fleeing lockdown go skiing, CCP literally welding people homes Japanese dude confirmed case went like four different bars intentionally spreading. 

Ass-hole human trait. safety data provided phase 2 trial looks good, though may rare side effects cannot captured small trials like these. Evidence effectiveness come phase 3 trial results revealed, would happen months. least longer confined cages. curious source didn‚Äôt say source, tell lockdown several countries mentioned never restrictions Hadrian's wall would come useful. main criticism started rolled guess that's happens sturgis pot... K. I'm saying things, longer *as* necessary, still going changed consider ""normal."" 

How quick going kiss hug someone meet bar? fast go packed concert? movies blockbuster opening night? continue excess deaths hospitalizations pre-pandemic levels, Covid transmission controlled, etc. level community risk pre-pandemic. 

I see balanced medium working currently places US, live. Covid spread controlled within nation, could see opening things middle ground. constant game whack-a-mole best see happy middle ground. see complacency irresponsibility. also think look state numbers. There's really US state ""safe"" continually travel states cannot truly controlled (maybe AK HI controlled). US reached ""happy medium"" all. accepted increased human suffering. 

I create excess contacts pandemic continues basically could pose risk asymptomatic carrier contribute sense creating unnecessary contacts normalcy OK (i.e. even antibodies believe I'm immune, want contribute consensus unsafe behavior anyone could claim antibodies etc). 

As said elsewhere, tip contactless takeout do. oppose low contact contactless restaurant operations. oppose irresponsible normalcy. nation's job issues, think need income fix addresses pandemic, rush back prior jobs unsafe etc. patient want take treatment half-assing it. Like stopping taking antibiotics days start working ""it's gone now"".

 Listen scientists doctors, dumbass. They're trying save life. Yeah miss fascist Australian shit. thing fate worse death  earning wage half work? Would love to, he‚Äôs old cat, 15th birthday, he‚Äôs got problem tooth vet recommend eat solid food. afraid put though take care age said long doesn‚Äôt seem affected eat wet foods.

He‚Äôs spry little shit though, seems working! C'est tr√®s inqui√©tant et tout ce que le gouvernement dit, c'est de continuer √† se laver les mains, √† prendre des distances sociales et √† porter un masque. Nous devons faire plus pour l'arr√™ter. renowned world leader said impossible? reason believe wouldn't???? 


Seriously, precedent? virus chunk code, even infected person suffer symptoms, they're still generating new viruses, they? viruses waiting opportunity spread. vaccine isn‚Äôt panacea make virus go away, especially requires seasonal vaccination. need kind powerful therapeutic. Cases rise. Something done bring r rate else end utilise emergency 'hospitals' built long.

Lockdown mean nothing. good start would imposing curfew 10pm bars. seemed good effect Belgium. quite yet, they've almost cracked it. woke 4 every day height pandemic. stage 1,2 July, same. 

The lack business activity downtown Toronto given day feels like lazy Sunday, continues defy logic rising housing costs GTA

Keep mind I've heard Dr Bonnie Henry mandated masks indoors BC??? Really? municipality almost everywhere Southern Ontario indoor face mask/covering policy now. Even remote camping towns, surprising me. 

Although places adhere lot hotels. municipal community centres remain closed. Expecting 100% compliance recommendations foolish. 100% compliance would many ways simply impossible, provincial federal governments know this. know people try best comply, much reasonably possible still living lives, others won‚Äôt care all. aren‚Äôt police state (fortunately) don‚Äôt option getting Big Brother make sure latter group don‚Äôt throw house parties.

That said, you‚Äôre ignoring bigger picture think BC Canada. reality COVID disease contagious human society eradicate stop spread without vaccine cure. It‚Äôs reason haven‚Äôt managed eliminate common cold flu despite fact inconvenience even kill us every year. 

The stuff like masks distancing slow spread, stop it. Without spread would faster cases would higher.

You‚Äôre simply incorrect naively, unrealistically optimistic say ‚Äúwe course hit zero‚Äù would ‚Äúthrough this‚Äù everyone used masks hand sanitizer more. thing actually slowed spread complete lockdown, barely sustainable even couple months going. Said lockdown resulted GDP going 40% 8 million Canadians going CERB, ending shortly. temporary emergency measure absolutely cannot keep indefinitely.

Finally, even magically reached zero cases, New Zealand did, disease would inevitably reintroduced somewhere else...as New Zealand. would lot faster, since aren‚Äôt isolated island small population like NZ. Remember 50% bare minimum acceptance world get effective vaccines we'll switch instead. Seriously like 'rona superspeeders every nationality. Months later: 500 popular restaurants reopen pandemic subsides though? Depends many take it. Well, wonderful. Thank you! years believed ""The Welfare Queen"". Now, don't, despite fact born liberal, fact personal experience individual welfare system. 

I friend met bus. chatted lot. worked keep welfare payments childcare. smoked lot pot, issues getting things like diapers toilet paper, many welfare. gave money, loan...just helping hand. good job IRS came along, got it, elated her. Jobs like came guaranteed retirement, excellent health benefits, hard fired from. would set life. 

A month later, saw her. looked bedraggled. asked wrong, begged judge told truth. agreed, explained rather sheepishly: called sick several times, friend punch timecard. found out. fired. astonished. taken secure future thrown toilet. Perhaps lived welfare long handle actual responsibility. Maybe pot. Either way, learned welfare system help people help themselves. series burning hoops jumped through, stay alive. 

Additionally, argument homosexuality one hit home. lived child teenager completely heterosexual community. never understood violin teacher ""gay"". knew bit strange, but...so Liberace, everyone loved him!

When high school started, happy find enclave writers hang with. One day, discussing friends group, older alumni caringly gently told two matriarchs club bisexual. told jealous friendship them, angry. days kept myself, one day, inexplicably, two jumped front me, locked throat tickling kiss embrace heterosexual would ever conceive of. time ponder it. accepted it, evidence right eyes. 

I think personal experience certainly one effective ways change minds.  That's true, one imminent crises would fine me. Excuse take mask off. Possibly longer depending election goes.  earth would scrap one??? literally furthest comes data. Events like pause happen _all time_ vaccine trials, literally _all time_, never hear trials ever much public eye.

Take step back here. University Oxford vaccine. people spearheading incredibly experienced scientists (feel free google Sarah Gilbert Adrian Hill.) data overseen AstraZeneca lots independent overseers UK government. gets way approved, _entire world_ going want fingers pie comes seeing data.

These vaccines going get away bad data. Everyone going demand maximum transparency, maximum scrutiny. 

IF vaccine proves dangerous that's gets scrapped. reason resumed simple: proven yet. something like 70 million hrc, 67 million djt, 110 million non- voters. U.S. home...actually white supremacy started colonization nvm. U.S. get back *a new* normal late 2021, Fauci says. FTFY NBC...

The new normal likely take path new normal 9/11. checks. supplies hand contingencies. government offices (or re-establishing office Clinton Bush set precisely pandemics.)

But may come this, fundamental change healthcare system. COVID-19 proved delicate piece-meal system is, nothing will. US want resolution pandemic? Why? Many countries open well good. talk people aren‚Äôt managing hypertension well years ago. Less half population manage blood pressure so.

Obesity also epidemic drastically increased time. 

It‚Äôs little complicated discussion pretty interesting. Imagine getting injection ice-fucking-cold purposeful infection post-vaccine stage 2, least Moderna did. limited, ofc, happen. people obviously consented it.

It‚Äôs generally unethical, solving pandemic essential, *some* safety standards dropped.

The reason stage 3 high infection areas stage 3 focuses real world testing, like seeing vaccine effective regardless individual‚Äôs choices habits, rather testing controlled environments. example, stage 2 test subjects expected stay away general public; don‚Äôt make sure vaccine test subject isn‚Äôt infecting public, see effects vaccine relatively clean environment. online shopping, words express much miss shopping person. would totally go back heartbeat, however, pinch I'd probably likely order online there, bulk items before. Oh honey... no, he‚Äôs talking old normal. Mask goes down. eat. talk. Virus airborne. obviously, yeah, risky behavior. new normal arrived. We're pretty similar there. get along brother, parents, siblings, rest extended family feel like strangers. 

Probably we're 'wierdos' family; Twins, LGBTQ+, successful outside family business - mostly really get family support younger, everything own. 

Growing white suburbia whole motherfucking trauma itself. already know answer schadenfreude sub downright foul. must worse trump..... Driving car calculated risk. US, ~100 people per day die car accidents. Sending child daycare/school calculated risk, without Covid. risk/reward trade natural process. I‚Äôm going stop driving may die wreck, take necessary precautions lower risk. Yep back CDC.

Is though? seems may misled. Wall Street Journal publish article headline saying hospital data reporting switching back CDC's system, based (supposedly misinterpreted) statement Dr. Birx, reporting amended update less day later HHS released press statements denying policy reached comment today, HHS denied characterization WSJ article. data collection system reportedly still processed HHS, according agency, CDC‚Äôs involvement said limited creation automated reporting process ease burden daily reporting data made repeated attempts explain Wall Street Journal process COVID-19 data reporting changing. false reporting sow confusion undermines public health response,‚Äùsaid Michael Caputo, HHS assistant secretary public HHS spokesperson directly respond question Birx would said new data-reporting system would ‚Äúmoved back CDC‚Äù indeed  No.

Most people get covid recover. Nobody sit dispute that. Nobody saying incredibly dangerous disease around. 

A fraction develop life long issues.

A fraction die.

All viruses like this. However COVID-19 much larger chance latter two categories diseases. Especially old people. 

This compounded lack prior immunity exponentially. R virus smaller, would probably issue. danger really ability sicken vast quantities people indiscriminately time. Completely overwhelming hospitals services, easily infiltrating vulnerable populations undetected. House Party ~~Attendees~~ \[HOSTS\] Covid Yay, something new look forward to! Honestly accepted republicans went 0 1200. People listen science would continue listen science

LOL, yeah, that's issue, know integrate new information. linked cdc excess deaths without comment.

I wish people deny science could driven away, sadly happens.

This logic. article talks people Covid. That's me. It‚Äôs completely insane. Blows mind every day. Stop. Yeah. needed hang ‚Äúmom‚Äù anyway. Right flu season niceeeeeeeee.. fuck florida hate place Yeah, I'm talking trajectory. Deaths falling rate. Maybe your're smelly. 

jk, I'm german basically same. There's least half opened window living room, even freezing. summer, usually windows half open, balcony door full open. mothers. don‚Äôt forget EU countries ALSO reopen protests government didn‚Äôt cave them. Shush, sub doom gloom. Florida. Check deaths today. Coronavirus 2 worse first well. ever even going attempt writing something substance? Also expand second point, hospitals handle patients different virus infections could mean higher load crossover risks. Based trip summer, never anything begin with. Never saw single mask gas stations I‚Äôve become resigned scenario well. I‚Äôm careful family; don‚Äôt want get sick. societal level, know aren‚Äôt going relief vaccine widely available. We‚Äôre far past point containment.  patient ask sequelae COVID exactly described: really know range fairly benign fairly malignant, want apart statistic. Kids RSV infections likely asthma later life. Bacterial pneumonia lead [nasty lung usually seen elderly. Pathogens usually residual effects last quite awhile. Interesting. Thanks pointing  same. definitely seems much worse winter.

Here Australia, worse southern cities (winter cold).

Meanwhile, north, land right-wing morons wouldnt wear masks, problem all. didn‚Äôt need government mandated ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù achieve it.

Everyone Sweden looks like everyone else Sweden, Swedes lot alike typical handful Americans. Homogenous, might say. Much easier build (or maybe merely observe) consensus kind society, without institutional intervention, behavior ""salad bowl"" like USA U.S. government response one case cases 'Nothing see here""


By time someone decides ask citizens nicely wear masks socially distance, opposition already mobilized, marching streets, demanding restrictions lifted, pretending rights violated. Wow, uses math math? whole world is, US I'm licensed government bureaucrats entire summer prepare chose to.

Cause they‚Äôre either getting way, shoot don‚Äôt like. protest(like masks haircuts) storm government property, fully armed lethal weapons still get pass. It‚Äôs bad don‚Äôt REAL issues protest about.  done quite times myself. COULD GO WRONG CaNt StAy ClOsEd FoReVeR Well clearly right??

More likely Swedes socially distancing effectively sustainably (unlike Spanish, hitting nightclubs summer) - thus keeping lid things. wear mask protect worry spreading others. social pressure protect literally every American, time basically encouraging civil war, incredibly bizarre. trends deaths always lag behind cases? Since love Fauci much must agree assessment safely vote person? POSSIBLE mixture population immunity seasonality cause decline weather becomes ""favorable"" virus population immunity suppressing enough virus return.

That possible. would say certain areas low levels population immunity probable (ie Wisconsin, Minnesota, etc).


That said virus over, worse case scenario, end year. US reached herd immunity.

Places like FL, AZ, etc least 20% probably approaching 30% infected. Even fades getting way soon.

If cases keep falling Sweden enters fall we'll know herd immunity threshold closer 20-30% many projected. far even transition fall Sweden seeing virus fade away.


The outbreak US South though functionally over. done. agree. Good know, thank you. havent looked awhile.  exactly it. It‚Äôs well good upper middle class families say schools stay closed - working class families can‚Äôt stay home supervise kids work can‚Äôt always done remotely.

And, everything, kids going left behind..: kids need education support most. today, 912,212 reasons little reaction. thoughtful, well presented, logical rebuttal. Take bow. Wow people called 0 0 mer saying kids germ factories awful quiet lately. long relatives start getting comfortable absence, wind caring even visit.  use WhatsApp messaging. passive news feed friends though. Pain. least children schools come contact older people daily school lives! 

No, wait... also literally welded people‚Äôs doors shut Wuhan. sure something would strive towards.  Forgive ignorance can't leaders make law wear mask goes away? Like get ticket caught without one. believe would happen lmao *posts logical explanation actually huge deal*

Omg disappointing I‚Äôm anti-mask Covid hoax, I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs since it‚Äôs Jurassic change don‚Äôt want admit it. It‚Äôs kinda like relieve call family member dead sudden, usually first stage disbelief, mask mandate everything closing weird coping mechanism people. guess tho look transmission maps paper, wasn‚Äôt single case child-to-child transmission within childcare facilities. always staff spreading children. It‚Äôs possible teacher spread kid A, kid B later got sick, would link kid B directly teacher rather kid A. could limitation study.

3 12 kids seem infected siblings. 6 12 kids seem infected adult household.  Ahh okay, dr. saw tv last week must uninformed. guess try Kylebutmakeitold. hospitals overwhelmed? No. Never were. Open up. Thank much! ""Liberate Michigan"" social distancing. People aren‚Äôt household group ‚Äúshoulder shoulder‚Äù Canadian living US ...I sadly agree this. Especially seeing Trump 2020 signs yards. symptom American disease, cause. riots/protests unprompted they've come many times change. people pissed want country burn change happens. Stopping spread always goal.

Slowing enough overwhelm hospitals first priority stopping spread FAILED KEEP POPULATION.

Always remember that. could kept even entering population enough problem. didn't. failed Step 1 Pandemic Containment. Thus rapidly move Step 2 - management critical resources (hospitals).

Pandemics end hospitals overrun.

If anyone else thought life would business usual hospitals ok, understand means live pandemic I'm sorry that. I‚Äôve heard stomach acids would kill virus food. forgot /s. No. TM rare side effect vaccines. However examined dismissed cases.

It's unreasonable assume TM first case here.

And MS absolutely vaccine side effect. lovely. kids miss grandma. husband mom. But, yeah, I'm real person care Iove. find mother law nice person. /S takes incredible amount hubris make sweeping policy based total eradication novel virus. become prevailing requirement? ever going go back justifying 60k flu deaths year this? incredibly hypocritical? stopped correcting Americans started shooting stabbing people asking wear masks. population fucking insane. even go outside anymore. thing ever comment intellectually dishonest made set argument that's impossible attack since wrong start with. Hope so, despite political drama. Yup lol usually go ‚Äúoh okay‚Äù everything say political.  according stock market. like explanation mine, let‚Äôs run argument impossible attack there's nothing wrong I'm aware, saw that, I'm side. understand bias bad treatment First People... part meant said Canada perfect.

Live America ita true Americans pretty trash. ICU, possible ventilators switched time instead sort romanticized coincidence? compare sicknesses year.

seriously people fucking dumb? whole non-event full 95 iq takes like yours. people hate us Americans. never blame world sentiment us. Great news. hopefully gives people confidence process since paused, way around. key thing people US deficient. sunny states like Florida, Arizona, etc good chance getting enough sun. I‚Äôm Oregon doctors always told every single person living supplement vitamin it‚Äôs impossible get enough sun. That's one moral stance -- one share -- say people think differently moral values problem. continue lots people worldwide refuse behave. reevaluate point view read moral philosophy. is, care results rather feeling superior. honest I'm american I'm afraid others.... want us hunker home communities,

‚ÄúHey guys 99% Americans discriminated imo lol‚Äù

‚ÄúBro joke‚Äù

I love reddit sometimes. Reddit moment think people realized they‚Äôd rather contract disease significant morbidity mortality rather contract months later. think it‚Äôs also apparent point it‚Äôs impossible get cases zero nearly zero thought one point. Basically accepted failure mass casualties possible outcome that‚Äôs ended with. know survive fedex box. 72 hours box non porous surface. Technically half us voted candidate. Trump lost popular vote electoral vote voting system broken. üôÉ still France Spain lastet European country go back normal situations

However earlier USA likely come times.

1. common UVC germicidal lamp. damage organic material, tend burn flesh.
2. Producing particular waveform easy noone commercially makes these.
3. might produce ozone, good inhale.
4. Limited actual testing humans animals confirm they're safe expose people long periods. Space Force really let us down, huh change wording? ""Frau"" mean ""vacationer"". woman works Germany. say vacationer, says ""woman"". also validates closures schools universities last year. Imagine hadn't. Hospitals would overwhelmed. yep I've tried online phone several times last couple days still can't get test. Sorry hear that.

But also, lol, ""chin masks."" people live besides scientists crew? government? I'm curious way life now. Yep making sure juice worth squeeze. Low efficacy would fine low complications, see another problem arising say 30% effective, public acts 100% effective. cautiously optimistic first round vaccines. lot variables air.

In gut though, think mass vaccination acquired immunity, within year problem minimal comparison now. Way ahead you! I've taking French lessons DuoLingo long lockdown. Still anywhere near fluent, I'm getting there! (Je mange des connaissances!) mean, literally projecting get bad March. Oh. Don‚Äôt forget elevate shitty loud people positions power regular basis act shocked don‚Äôt know hell they‚Äôre doing. Exactly.  political one side. mask political statement. PPE. election decision nothing changing everything changing worst.

God wish Ranked Choice Voting. times like people fucking yearn third fourth option. I'm tired ""symbolic"" votes ""spoiler"" votes whole notion ""throwing vote away."" ballot never feel like hail mary throw. undemocratic. Fuking moron Im allowed smoke weed federally dont listen federal government dont even understand spewing. might sound dickish, really mean best way possible. Try put grandparents shoes think makes feel see falling addiction destroy life worse. 

You‚Äôre right thing staying away protecting them. There‚Äôs nothing situation didn‚Äôt cause it. Don‚Äôt let trump cronies push back dark place. Neither you, grandparents deserve that. see point would say used many day, look great job done Isn‚Äôt technically inbetween first wave second wave? still first wave means steady period ahead us second wave right? Isn‚Äôt waves work? Legit question. Yes, nothing COVID. pandemic apocalypse.  Deaths lagging indicator. Ontario numbers spiking, especially Toronto. BC Quebec also seeing big increases daily case counts.

There‚Äôs chance masks precautions reduce mortality compared first wave, number definitely isn‚Äôt going stay zero :/  Tell sars. actually wonderful (albeit expected) news.  means we'll likely light flu season year due covid-19 prevention methods travel restrictions. 

That really help keep ERs ICUs open covid patients.

It's nice little good news.  

I wonder persistent covid prevention methods even vaccinations going put permanent damper flu. ...wishful thinking maybe.

I also wonder diseases stomped on? STDs? tens thousands? I‚Äôm asking understand stopped testing don‚Äôt know many vaccinated far. 

The adenovirus vaccine never approved use it? 

Sorry don‚Äôt facts.

Edit add: haven‚Äôt able determine many people vaccinated already. found started trial vaccine candidate AZD1222 United States last month, plans enrol 30,000 adults 80 sites across country. Efficacy trials United Kingdom, Brazil South Africa involving total around 17,000 people also way. double-blind trial, roughly 20,000 US trial participants given two doses vaccine, 10,000 would receive placebo. large-scale testing people needed regulators, US Food Drug Administration, approve vaccine widespread use.[A leading coronavirus vaccine trial hold: scientists don‚Äôt really think question ‚Äúworth it.‚Äù It‚Äôs question inevitability. Yes, things lower risk infection. shutdowns could part area‚Äôs healthcare infrastructure gets overwhelmed.

But end day, virus spreading. could hit herd immunity.  Politicians set rules, consultation health experts.

Do link showing state's current rules set approval health experts? 

I asked links, refused provide them, I'm asking obvious questions instead. Would've lot easier link info. That‚Äôs fetish. Death snu-snu. Yeah, Pandemic great lessons Covid. teaches us 4 ways lose every way win, sometimes cards going die despite playing optimally. That's means. wanna cross Atlantic America gonna wait primitives underdeveloped country permitted entry again. decent r/selfawarewolves material. Yes, country less public medical social support poor education quality difficulty achieving policy compliance. Thank captain obvious. argument lockdowns. argument stupid desperate population. Hes gonna declare marshal law Nov. 1st issue national stay home order. obviously know lot history. Tell us Worth reading Stomach bugs school easiest thing contract...like even manage that? Nevermind, know. already know answer question.. Politicians set rules (in consultation health experts), ones legally empowered make rules.

Why acting like dumbass? good look. damage/symptoms it? lives, poorer countries converging richer ones. huge shift. going away ever. might go away severe disease, treatments vaccines. likely light flu season. 

Usually travels southern hemisphere spreads. low travel least moderate prevention methods, we'll probably low flu rates year. ain't lol got voted instantly posted report death r/SanAntonio someone 'knows people administration' buddies. report  worked insurance 30 years, understand risk.

If now, imagine ever will.

Seriously though, imagine better thinking risk 60 years old people want ignore virus see little personal risk damn everyone else different people want drink drive.

with way IFR shoots age, surprise covid positive person thinks issue present much risk drunk driver streets.

Obviously, speculating. microbiologist actuary. I'm lincoln still keeping rules cause mayor bat shit stupid like ole petey ricketts fuck gets person like think ok go tirade much hate Californians someone dared mention they're hard time dealing natural disaster?

That's right toxic fuck one likes you. 

Says guy calling stranger internet names making assumptions someone never met. know nothing me

Right, basis making assumptions truly hope grow nasty disgusting phase life become better person. right toxic fuck one likes you.

Really weird thing say someone never met ASSERTING person know make assumptions still decided needed start ranting much despise me.

I never spoke personally, spoke Californians ruining states. took personally. I've commented behavior, I've used things said thread. Meanwhile seem think read person, life likes me, mental hope get help need.

Got therapy ago moving past shock realizing california leftist mentality destroying life. great job, wife, dog, house, work home, kid coming soon. life great man. Maybe take look life see projecting little here. unlike Californians need take look state bring places, since experience tend flee burning wasteland turned state into, show new place, demand sympathy, start criticizing welcome making 401k account grow. Without California's tech companies retirement date would pushed back 10 years. damn ungrateful.

This weird comment. assets invested home equity, wife real estate overseas, long y'all show burn state, I'll fine. think I'd dependent stocks derive value things run Californians? Smart investors pulled money years ago. I'll never understand people kids can't even afford feed Bible told to.  true well put ‚Äúdied...‚Äù that‚Äôs feels like. know what, yeah, are.

Are rules set politicians health experts? curious. one group expert viral infections, one not. get hyphy ignore response.

Like, what's that? assume happens would come sick? Didn‚Äôt boss offer paid sick leave employees encourage people actually use whenever sick? sick leave though that‚Äôs much tougher choice. follow restrictions moment. complain lot, follow look people following them. I'm talking vaccine would end it, taken enough people, enough people due ignorant right-wing fake news (these people follow restrictions moment).

In situation, would done can: follow restrictions vaccine, taken vaccine, waited enough time reasonable enough uptake vaccine. I'm punished ignorance bet people following restrictions point either.  Shocker. almost like it's.... simple logic and... SCIENCE. Hang there, praying best all! P.S. probably would caved letting hubby house too....

Lincoln finishing version reconstruction left tumours in, LBJ signing Civil Rights Act concentrated one spot, every years there‚Äôs version huckster instead doctor.

If vaccine works well, vaccinate entire city, never *know* worked there's meaningful infection rates compare. Damn, forgot that. We‚Äôre doomed, Except mutate see youre maga troll. Take care. Ill whatever want keep family safe, silly man. France lock hard long enough

I've always known vaccine would useful, *that* mindblowing anything, concern everyone sub oblivious this. perhaps sub dumpster fire all. need actually apply get citizenship vote.

About anything funneling massive amounts government money corporate coffers. It‚Äôs possible know.. wasn‚Äôt newsom la county public health department didn‚Äôt clear anything anyone else. mess county is. It‚Äôs really shame. Pretty much represents America. Everyone wants live city/burb, everyone's leaving middle nowhere want ""freedom spread lethal disease."" disease isn‚Äôt similar flu, total excess deaths US right quite close flu season, total deaths per week thousands lower.

We don‚Äôt know deal yet. Due change behaviors, viral interference, Southern Hemisphere didn‚Äôt much flu season, North might see same. stay strong remember fundamentals along way.

Wear mask.

Most importantly, Kind other! Considering first reported CDC December 31st, even clear novel disease time... yeah no. Where? worried ""lost generation"" elderly. face reality point. elderly time. young sacrificed elderly hang little longer.

So end bunch dead old people far future anyway, combined bunch poorly educated socially stunted children, problems entail years decades line, decided sacrifice young old cling life little longer.

I sincerely doubt children. putting there. seem idea important socialization regular education is. I‚Äôve read several recent posts saying thing, adjusting expectations vaccines, long may take things normal. Even Dr Fauci pushed date said we‚Äôd mostly back normal summer 2021 late 2021 üò£

And discouragement describe. It‚Äôs hard. 

Once safe vaccine available, need persuade Americans get vaccinated soon possible. Reaching 70% rate vaccination coverage make gigantic difference. Yeah, we're woods yet.  know getting downvoted; true. (The rest world share too, seemingly lower concentrations?) Well reddit seem attract introvert fappers hardly leave house normal times. course not, flu anyway, disappear Easter like COVID-19 Twice Likely Eaten Restaurants, CDC Study Reddit..

That doesn‚Äôt mean ignore loss 193,000 rising fellow Americans died due coronavirus far year US. I‚Äôd really rather see total keep climbing.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre number one!‚Äù desirable goal reach country-stat rankings it‚Äôs ranking mostly preventable disease death toll. see. Hopefully make it!
I didn‚Äôt think gift card revenue could ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù used business cards used. 210,000 excess deaths 6 months lot nation 330 million. Especially considering fair share due lockdowns, disease itself.

We might 8% people dying year typical year. Sad? Certainly. worth destroying nation over.  Cool? That's 'socialized' medicine ya'.... know Brazilians say caramba Well coronaviruses NL63 (causes common cold) SARS1 also use ACE2.

So, telling college kids wealthy jobs? news? proof general get antibodies while. People get reinfected flu multiple times season. people weaker less reactive immune systems happen. extremely inconsiderate. Japan East Asia, people wear masks SUSPECT flu.

People severe health problems virus get rid it. 100% selfish. don‚Äôt care getting sick hearing it. It‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs need go party right absolutely zero reason. Theres strong evidence many people cross immunity T/B cells well exposure past coronaviruses. Actually, COVID-19 disease caused virus SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus).

Next time correct someone, try know hell talking about. Especially going incredibly pedantic. setting dunked otherwise, seen. 

However,the correct wording COVID upper respiratory viral infection (not virus). figured frequenting sub would know mean. Well considered experts credentials back situation Germany situation U.S. population Germany 83 million. population U.S. 330 million. currently 40-60,000 confirmed cases daily. number probably high still due different group counting fast testing thing manipulate numbers. Germany around 1,500 2,000 cases daily probably honest number. look per capita basis, situation U.S. least 4 times worst. look positivity rates, Germany 2.54% U.S. 8.18% currently according John Hopkins. comparison done Germany apples apples comparison opinion. New Brunswick pretty much requires nurses bilingual English French.

Maybe way anyway terminal condition want enjoy little time left? one relative similar situation. Can‚Äôt say blame either. take bed await grim reaper? No, no, *should* dick topic!! apologize caring lives others! Holy crap, let anti-maskers make feel bad caring other's lives; experience compassion caring mean shouldn't. 

And we're talking lives line: good enough reason 'be asshole' anti-masker, know is. figure half world got point many people let many assholes get away assholes. say, more!  dunno, uni pretty well.

I feeling it‚Äôs uni‚Äôs attract certain type people... ""Enough enough""...lol. 

Ok, wealthy CEO's. Wonder motivation is. chancellor *no* authority pandemic matters whatsoever, 100% state business. mean, you‚Äôd win put giant board field covering holes. That‚Äôs single cohesive policy is. giant board going country knock down... notice that, least far Europe goes, deaths decreased dramatically point country losing double figures per day. days ago USA overtook Italy deaths per capita. already done. We've reached social death virus. needed taken care right away, carried half measures 7 months expected results. There's always limit people reach comes routine affected. Hell, I'm getting tired point. makes sense enough let run wild, nowhere near enough actually working towards getting rid it. blame them? Look fucking quickly toilet paper sold out. get toilet paper June July. Hell, took Amazon months get shit order package grocery delivery, everything runs Amazon.

Yet even 6 months later, republicans still can't move past ""omg flip flopped."" genuinely absurdly ignorant words Yeah number don‚Äôt match anything reported here! cases going weekly basis stopped watching daily reports together, check week. It‚Äôs fucking embarrassing Iowa right now. home son teaching (state granted waiver 2 weeks thankfully) listening press conference. smiled said zero plan ever make mask mandate. kept getting backed corner questions would rarely answer. Can‚Äôt wait see lose attempts get re-elected two years. know 1 person got go 3 degrees separation someone died it.

That yesterday, found coworker died it. last spoken month ago, thought extended vacation got news. ""vacation"" suffering 10 days hospital, ultimately dying.

There's still plenty time someone closer die pandemic over, advise inviting it. Counties magical barriers around outsiders enter... wait nevermind, that's trump's wall, wait never mind... know going happen. health experts saying fine go groups without social distancing area? Links, please. no, links numbers - specific health experts (not politicians) saying perfectly OK go area groups, social distancing, described. Meanwhile, everyone acting like nothing going live life like normal. know asymptomatic? wtf suppose fauci? Seriously give us plan. whole god damn two week lockdown it‚Äôs 6 months. Whatever work spit out. Imagine capitalist banning customers making money. absolutely agree! 

What don‚Äôt agree though lower deaths due increased testing. makes sense... lot places right like fair weigh risks vs. rewards, keep mind pandemic actions (almost certainly) affect you. Let's say go group 3 friends, decide worth risk, one unknowingly infected. hang out, 4 could infected, raises likelihood virus spreading throughout community 4 go daily lives (whether grocery shopping, work, etc.). Yeah, 4 order groceries food, work home, leave house hang open air space, fine, otherwise running risk contributing greater community spread. struggle depression too, found greatly alleviated hanging friends weekly basis via Zoom. Stay house invite friends neighbors over. kids take thing school, thing traded, lost, borrowed, stolen, accidently thrown away. Clearly restrictions working. Time give completely. /s know caught it? great news fear Canada bad trend. seemed flatten curve look case statistics slowly going day. 

Remember fundamentals Canada üá®üá¶ 

2-3 meters apart. 
Wear mask. 
Wash hands frequently.
Be kind. think spawned nether regions cosmos. Biden trump terrible options Yeah majority died people 80 years old!!!  Well, 4 months second year pandemic, point virus lasted ""years"".

But nitpick words, many countries around world things control. yet know vaccine, know level efficacy said vaccine.

Also, many viruses lasted ""years"" despite vaccines treatments.

I've heard Trump sycophants claiming virus ""fade away"". used wonder filmmakers expected us believe Forrest Gump Bobby Boucher made college! 'conservatives' 'they going die anyway' argument? Kids gross, they're *genetically wired* gross, strengthens immune systems. 

Expecting override natural instincts germ magnets invisible, abstract danger always absurd, always doomed fail. states legally shut boarders? Like straight send state police line turn everyone back?  Almost anything within body heal, many parts do, things generally don't, rarely do, never heal. I'm sure affected covids lung damage heal, not, hundreds factors play outcomes. Yeah. spoken father since March shit, made known ilk welcome life, permanently.

He's always person, deep down; I've seen it. took good enough excuse let shit boil surface. police get database people tested positive Covid? Also, healthcare worker dumb fucks go fuck themselves. even talking about?! mild cause cripples you?! Fake News Bro virus ü¶† isn‚Äôt deadly think. Wake smell coffee Herd immunity thing Want kiss better? Ah yes ago entire world suffering virus help libs beat trump. Back like April May, one coworkers said conference call, ‚ÄúMy county still lockdown drive 30 miles get haircut.‚Äù Like, motherfucker, that‚Äôs shit still going on! People hate trump would purposefully wear one lol Probably airborne, though absolutely aerosolized breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing. reasoning, US numbers would inflated compared European countries. numbers spiked heavily much later pandemic, overall testing capacity increased. There'd still 2.5 months turn country dictatorship. live can‚Äôt leave house? I‚Äôm gonna see family two fucking years. Fuck that. bars &amp; restaurants spent 5 months seeing family. I‚Äôm going see them. Asking people country doesn‚Äôt plan place except wait vaccine absurd. article posted good faith sort comments desired instead discussing ongoing uncertainty.

One health care. cower, since you‚Äôre shit part society Maybe use frog boiling water analogy.....  r/NoShitSherlock Canada tests asymptomatic people could be, Alberta recorded 1 death last 24hr. So,  Mayo Clinic study says would need around 70% reach herd immunity.

This vaccination. 

Because heterogeneity HIT via spread lower.

How much lower?

No idea. Nobody does. insanely hard model.

We know sure months places trying get herd immunity seem reached around 20%. virus fading rapidly Sweden months approaching de facto elimination.

States like Arizona FL probably around 20-30% virus rapidly fading away even without lockdown.

Multiple serosurvey's NYC places around 25% infected April virus rapidly faded million would needed herd immunity, 5% mortality rate would 10million+ dead


5% even general ballpark. factor least 10x. least.

IFR western nations may around 0.5% Spring variety reasons IFR fallen good bit. Possibly falling 0.2%.

Also, IFR varies significantly age. capitalist mouthpiece manipulates people  sense sarcasm irony, hope good rest day. disagree bit here. 

In Italy we've partly open since May 18th completely open since June 3rd, we're averaging 90,000+ tests day, we're seeing numbers, given closed discotheques kind dancing hall, even open air dancing halls, August 16th; know France, rules still much enforced, places still can't enter freely, wait turn, social distancing still enforced everywhere, masks still compulsory everywhere inside public places, whether maintain social distances still wear them, masks compulsory even outside there's risk gatherings. Yeah, big brain time alright Wow grow kid, care someone Mumbai, Minnesota, Moscow, need go proper channels receive certification, especially safety sensitive industries.  None difficult, none make Covid go away either.

Florida might able hide Covid counts, can‚Äôt hide overall death count causes going down. thought going disappear Easter, summer, election, election? I'm paranoid restaurants, people clean. Plus see point paying top dollar crappy microwaved food. narrative politics. talking case fatality ratio point mentioned. referring deaths per population, exceeded Italy today. India extreme challenges population density shockingly good take long. That's credit able damnation country. could said Mexico Brazil. I'm sure say also understating numbers considering population density compared US case rate % population urbanized areas would interesting compare he's selfish dumb asshole right? No, haven‚Äôt been. studies would need prove reinfection possible, actually likely individual level, vaccine induced immunity fades, fades quickly could ever administer vaccine. simply isn‚Äôt evidence support belief, however logical may seem.

There studies showing few, any, places herd immunity likely reached naturally sufficiently quickly, way health systems could cope. doesn‚Äôt defeat concept vaccine induced herd immunity; simply says aiming herd immunity letting virus wash population terrible idea. One thing sure need remove presidential oversight CDC, FDA, NIH, EPA justice department start with. I‚Äôm astounded there‚Äôs checks power regards. I‚Äôll first line (if can) get vaccine long it‚Äôs shoddy half assed influenced tRump one. 

On second thought tRump gets first vaccine random pick first lot. üòÜ He's still warning vaccines coming early, though. even 7-8 months, that's lot corona time. possible he's rounding up, note wording uses... ""been around"" year. Keep repeating message. poeple take longer get it, need see effects around put value message.

There really people Florida still minds changed deal pandemic.

Sadly, people Florida. Canadian neighbors. 2021 might perfect start, it'll way cleaner year. Except really isnt. chicken pox party intent get chicken pox someone already it. party people currently it. think true asymptomatic cases rare. cases symptoms appear within 2 weeks. Yeah could actually figure they've done wrong (cause obviously something least double here). damn privileged everything worked whole life ruined accident illness million dollar medical bill yeah. fucking privileged ration insulin obscene price America die young dirt cheap non shithole countries. non shithole countries event might cost couple hundred dollars max. dammed privileged get ""free"" covid 19 test bill 3000 dollars comes mail!

Should lie instead? read article? guess not. twin study exercise effects stress levels people Covid. not. people exercise level stress/anxiety people didn‚Äôt. 

TLDR: exercise help people pandemic stress/anxiety.

I imagine someone afford spend $3,000 exercise bike doesn‚Äôt level stress people right now. I‚Äôm guessing unemployment, eviction, money issues things worry about. main things causing stress/anxiety right now. That's even funnier then. Someone goes ""I'm cheering whichever vaccine works"", real world context 3-4 promising candidates production deals lined already begun manufacturing risk, walked said, ""There's use works can't produced widely."" wider thread Oxford vaccine too, manufactured risk.

It's equivalent wedding someone congratulates couple go ""Yes, eventually go honeymoon"". given. I'm misquoting mate, comment puzzling. one's talking low-probability vaccines manufacturers can't line production deals. redundant I'm fairly sure guy wrote meant 'whichever one works available enough might get take it"", unless likes dreaming hypotheticals. Yep, biggest issue going face people simply take vaccine.

I really curious see virus numbers play coming years. two demographics also prone prior covid well. Interesting, thanks. date, looking Worldometers, confirmed covid deaths Brazil 93,616, gap 16,000 deaths, much less (percentage wise) Latin American country data (Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia) exception Chile (where excess deaths match confirmed covid deaths almost perfectly). PEEPS!

THIS VIRUS OFFICIALLY GONE FAR! Covid sped death many simple illnesses don‚Äôt kill healthy people also kill previously compromised. 

So yes agree since know risk people likely know risk minority stay home WFH possible. rest us go outside resume normal life fear. going maskless. even told us wear them.

Or going bars pandemic either. 

Do know even less into? government deciding bears cost pandemic, government making risk assessments me. suck it. decided wear mask told to. Damn, sorry. impression international students paid more. going couple international friends told me. God, presumptive entitlement...

In one nation‚Äôs sharpest clashes school reopening, officials Des Moines say Iowa‚Äôs Republican governor pushing risk public safety.

No matter much tension surrounded reopening schools coronavirus pandemic, state local officials found way arrive sort plan first day classes.

But Des Moines, school began week local officials openly defying Iowa‚Äôs governor judge‚Äôs order teaching remotely. decision puts district‚Äôs funding administrators‚Äô jobs risk, leaves students locked athletics parents uncertain whether online classes even count.

The conflict perhaps nation‚Äôs starkest example tension Republican state officials, followed lead President Trump pushing schools reopen classrooms, local administrators, often Democratic-leaning cities, fear in-person instruction put students‚Äô teachers‚Äô health danger.

‚ÄúIt kind feels like science versus politics,‚Äù Des Moines schools superintendent, Thomas Ahart, said. ‚ÄúThe last thing want make political. desperately want able honestly tell staff students families I‚Äôm everything power keep safe.‚Äù


Gov. Kim Reynolds, part, argued Thursday pushing schools open classrooms, prioritizing needs vulnerable students. ‚ÄúWe simply cannot afford let students left behind even challenging times,‚Äù Ms. Reynolds, Republican, said news conference.

The dispute playing Iowa remains hard hit pandemic. past week, state nation‚Äôs third-highest number new coronavirus cases per capita, according New York Times tracking data.

‚ÄúI certainly would feel comfortable sending kids school level,‚Äù said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, advocated opening schools places like Northeast significantly fewer new cases per capita.

Iowa officials said 15 percent county‚Äôs coronavirus tests must positive two-week period schools close doors ‚Äî threshold least triple many public health experts recommended, one Dr. Jha called ‚Äúoutlandishly

Districts counties remain 15 percent test positivity threshold must offer least 50 percent classes person, governor ordered July. Polk County, includes Des Moines, average positivity rate 8 percent past two weeks.
The clash local state officials escalated Tuesday, first day school Des Moines, state judge refused district‚Äôs request block state order two sides fight legal battle, leaving district defiance governor courts continued teach online week.

Early summer, state officials district seemed page. state approved reopening plan Des Moines, superintendent said, 32,000 students could choose learning remotely returning school one two days week.


But things changed Mr. Trump began concerted push in-person learning, tweeting July 6, ‚ÄúSCHOOLS MUST OPEN FALL!!!‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SCHOOLS BRIEFING: It‚Äôs back school ‚Äî it?
Sign Up
Some states led Republican governors began put pressure districts meet Mr. Trump‚Äôs demands. day president‚Äôs tweet, Florida state education commissioner issued order requiring schools open classrooms five days week, limited exceptions, prompting lawsuits teachers‚Äô associations. Arkansas state education commissioner soon followed similar order.

In Iowa, Ms. Reynolds issued proclamation July 17 requiring schools offer primarily in-person instruction.

At time, new daily cases Des Moines rising. district decided longer safe offer in-person instruction, administrators applied state waiver offer virtual classes.

The request denied county‚Äôs test positivity rate state‚Äôs threshold, also requires least 10 percent district‚Äôs students must absent illness unless positivity rate goes 20 percent.

Iowa City, also fighting governor‚Äôs order court, granted waiver teach fully remotely case positivity rate currently 22 percent.

The governor said district offers virtual classes without approval, days count toward required 180 days instruction district must provide year. also said administrators defy state could face discipline licensing body, districts offering virtual instruction must suspend sports teams extracurricular activities.

Ms. Reynolds declined comment, spokesman, Pat Garrett, said governor ‚Äúbelieves getting Iowa‚Äôs students teachers back school safely important part state‚Äôs Covid-19 recovery.‚Äù


The Des Moines district, whose school board nonpartisan city leans Democratic, sued governor August. Tuesday, Judge Jeffrey Farrell Polk County District Court denied school district temporary injunction case worked way courts, saying state officials ‚Äúmade judgment call benefits sending kids back school outweigh increased risks illness death.‚Äù

School officials Des Moines refusing hold in-person classes, despite order Iowa‚Äôs governor judge‚Äôs ruling, risking school funding jobs think it‚Äôs unsafe.
The University Illinois Urbana-Champaign one comprehensive plans major college keep virus control. failed account students partying.
College students using apps shame schools better coronavirus plans.
For families, pandemic meant return native languages.
He added, ‚ÄúWhether right wrong, decision make.‚Äù

District officials continued hold online classes Wednesday Thursday despite judge‚Äôs decision. closed-door meeting school board lawyers Wednesday conversation superintendent state‚Äôs education commissioner Thursday, board met publicly Thursday evening discuss options, resolution.

‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs really changed terms safety virus community last three days,‚Äù Rob X. Barron, Des Moines school board member, said.
The death longtime special education teacher, fell ill out-of-state trip died coronavirus complications last week, school started, ratcheted concerns among district‚Äôs 5,000 employees. 1,500 staff members pre-existing medical conditions, according survey district conducted summer, 34 percent age 50.


Mr. Ahart, superintendent, said six bus drivers quit week concerns contracting virus. Joshua Brown, president local teachers‚Äô union, said several teachers inquired resign district agrees comply governor‚Äôs order.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary hell,‚Äù said Dave O‚ÄôConnor, 58, middle school social studies teacher high blood pressure health issues. added, ‚ÄúI always knew government could march war, didn‚Äôt know could march situation that‚Äôs unsafe.‚Äù

Many district‚Äôs school buildings aging ‚Äî average 65 years old, officials said ‚Äî poor ventilation crowded classrooms. High school classes often 40 students, Mr. Ahart said, even half capacity, students could remain six feet apart. ‚ÄúIt cannot done.‚Äù

Dr. Jha Brown suggested state work county health officials try lower coronavirus caseload community, making safer open schools, rather ‚Äútrying essentially push county something public health experts would agree wise.‚Äù

Parents students divided district‚Äôs resistance. Erin Willey, 48, whose younger daughter junior high school, said thought district overly combative, rather trying work state.

She said agreed high schools crowded, said thought district could find buildings ‚Äî either vacant ones already owned, ones could rent ‚Äî spread students out.
She said see coronavirus different diseases schools deal regularly. ‚ÄúThe fact life people get sick,‚Äù Ms. Willey said. Sweden lost lot citizens due this

Sweden lost lot citizens due failing secure nursing homes; death rate dropped considerably since then. going mention past death rates, may well start shaming Italy, Spain, New York also.

People critizise Sweden based happened several months ago, despite fact currently making great strides fight COVID. Neither 2nd, 3rd, 7th *9th* (US actually 10th) don‚Äôt see nearly many people criticizing countries they‚Äôre European, wrong.  there's difference fighting measles outbreak Jenny McCarthy's kid's school something level. time looking national leadership, acceptable say ""oh, job!"" Government never cared virus, rich pals economy. We're Canon fodder. getting point accepting way we're getting herd immunity matter hard try starting cut corners. family socially separate almost six months now. taking risks letting teenage son play sports letting 3-year-old play dates. Risk management decision putting possibility getting Covid mental health. also started seeing extended family close friends. still avoiding certain situations large crowds, restaurants, etc. still trying distance, right things like wearing masks using hand sanitizer. We're definitely reluctantly widen bubble time goes favor mental health. sucks could past this. thought Virus hit twice? Again, bullshit. Certain government jobs require member party organisation, doctor, dentist, nurse, teacher be. Two collegues mine doctors, members. Proves know nothing China even there. Oh goodness. got nothing else. Yeah, might well random it‚Äôs measuring. [It used show plants could feel really like China. Stop standing dishonesty, systematic cover-up plague CCP unleashed world (either knowingly via incompetence). 






























































 op thread never mentioned lockdown it‚Äôs relevant. What‚Äôs relevant people actually enforcing rules. Actually look medical reddit boards, appears hope placed new administration creation helpful epidemiological tools like national databases either obstructed, created badly compromised current federal gov't. wish I'd bookmarked thread, sorry can't relay details. recent protests incredibly likely least saying forever insane. think putting dates though honestly Fauci extremely poor predicting entire pandemic fact praise really total failure astounding first place.

It's almost like next Trump automatically look good. also go biologists govern society... stay yours. Better watch talking people's kids saying 1134 posted that. American, same. That's crazy.

That's 20% less *total* Norway since march (about 12k - 100-odd today, quite lot) understand physically school still thing. parents trusting anyone kids government proven lying all. going crazy everyone taking chances kid one 100s 1000s. anyone actually believed wasn‚Äôt possible? cannot fathom anyone would actually believe kids can‚Äôt get spread it. knowledge isn‚Äôt virus, disease, sickness etc. age discrimination... albeit manifest little different depending vulnerability sometimes come age see sickness. mention Sweden, never locked first place.

You never actually said anything point. supposed ‚Äúgrandma-killer‚Äù country got yelled at, shamed banned travel using overreaching lockdown like rest literally google Sweden‚Äôs covid strategy, since beginning placed social distancing guidelines.

The one mentioned above, criticized pretty much nothing leaving people die? When‚Äôd change? sub woke facts? Vishnu Krishna several thousands? That‚Äôs true Um Fauci said end 2021 pandemic over. saying give people reason comply. üòÇüòÇüòÇ ok pal  Depressed! That‚Äôs rich. He‚Äôs depressed Americans skeptical vaccine.

Edit: /s. 
States don‚Äôt those. CDC NIH meaningful national institutions, states need somewhere get guidance. good locking down, corona response would‚Äôve couple weeks month wouldn‚Äôt couple dozen cases.    There's way many folks still convinced, based data, ""its flu"" ""not fatal"" alter behaviors way. affects directly case late.

Facts Donald Trump raising bar everyone. Lowest unemployment minorities ever. 

Covid? fault. recall people like called racist xenophobic implementing travel ban China. Even Biden it. Fucking Nancy Pelosi went China town held press conference. 

So start blaming DJT mess it‚Äôs credible. Doesn‚Äôt matter panties get wad. 

Don‚Äôt worry. likely another 4 years anxty beating Hillary  Thats starting wage. start somewhere careers place usually challenging.

The average teacher 8 years experience completed required Masters degree $87,510 NYC.

I started career, masters $52,000. tight budget live San Francisco 30s.

Everyone every career work way - first years life luxury. 1st week school 5 staff members already caught kids school kids need stay campus year. let rip young people dont take back home. Due declining faculties older populations seem rely less wit wisdom benefits, old wisdom easily hacked fresh wit. You‚Äôre loon. social media restrictions states mask orders cases staying 40000 day? would explain preponderance man buns pink hairs storming around destroying things whilst confused gender. ""The study found positive negative cases reported going gyms, hair salons, shops in-home group gatherings rate. positive cases twice likely report dining restaurants within 14-day period feeling sick.""

You read article, right? pneumonia classified upper respiratory disease? go north unfortunately. Even friends nursing Canadian forced northern communities find work hiring freezes etc 400k-700k people die annually influenza, mean halt world economy every year save grandpa? say Uncle please stop? sounds like denial Less 10 deaths per day trivial number. Good opening up. We've open Texas while, bars. think good think good also probably different, since really me, opinion important.  mask mandates fear mask mandates leads less efficient social distancing.

This interesting, personally would still wear one think

But post r/conspiracy probably understand. Aren‚Äôt dumbest confident country? sadly Jan 20, 2025. Wow tested Modi already? entire race deserves discriminated couple hundred 500 million Americans? Gotcha. mean ‚Äúcurrent year‚Äù mean expect we‚Äôre evidently happy elect big orange asshats promise improve life dismantling infrastructure enact change. [If wasn‚Äôt sinking ship 2016, certainly Brazil there's essentially lock-down tho. live one first city ""lock-down"" (about 70% beginning march) honestly everything back normal around here. People simply care. Pubs, restaurants, gym... open. also wish people would stop talking bubbles.  bubbles. ‚Äúcohorts‚Äù. 

Little Jimmy goes school bus one set kids, spends day ‚Äúcohort‚Äù (and let‚Äôs face they‚Äôre socially distancing recess), gets picked school guardian it‚Äôs hockey practice (or insert activity here) team probably ALSO don‚Äôt socially distance hanging parking lot practice, it‚Äôs stop store get food/supplies, back home family may consist older/younger siblings different schools, parents working, family members working, hopefully they‚Äôre right things try catch anything.....

Lather rinse repeat every child slightly different scenarios.  bubbles!!!!!

Source: two kids play hockey. tournaments month. There‚Äôs lot extensive social distancing parking lots in-between games. It‚Äôs becoming lax. place ones still wearing masks outside.  Seriously people :( 30k people 1 developed MS (sounds like could happen naturally) 1 bad reaction. thousands. I'll still take available. immensely stupid enroll one vaccine trials.

Ummm actually immensely courageous them. people fully understand getting yet sign put line society move forward virus.

I guess expect medicine therapeutics magically pulled thin air everything rainbows sunshine. usual NYT decided insert negative propaganda article.

This time best thing come ""But making teachers work extra mandating perform health checks students!""

Conveniently ignoring Texas teachers forced making life death decisions told write will. people taking enough precautions prevent flu spreading, wouldn‚Äôt seeing many cases COVID either. are... CPC fiscal conservatives. left Democrats. want see hundreds thousands people die sake ""research"" ""safer vaccine""? times careful research times action. exactly sort mentality made US worst country world terms handling pandemics. No, sweetie, Exactly. Masters degree Clinical Research, (designing managing Clinical Trials) know lot area. paused abundance caution, able resume investigation. common normal. 

The health authorities hold companies thier reporting highest standards. One example sticks mind possibility ""squirrel bites"" listed potential side effect medical device trial someone got bitten can't PROVE wasnt related. That's extreme get point. Nothing gets swept rug. Yeah, shit. That‚Äôs pretty clear literature already. Pathologically, it‚Äôs pretty stereotypical viral pneumonia without fibrotic organization. guess I'll die Absolutely, lot time talking two different groups. doesnt violate shit, unless infected. general measures allways easier solving problem, decided declare everyone guilty infected without regards thats true punished everyone accordingly. Well, look situation differently. Due SARS, Taiwan blocked travel early wasn‚Äôt much community spread. say Taiwan already 5,000-10,000 cases closed borders, probably would needed stricter social distancing measures. Certain high ranking United States representative begs differ. upcoming election win going far proclaiming certain federal age cy withholding vaccine wants sabotage him. Sounds shape form familiar? depends entirely virus. vaccines beat back, we‚Äôll take masks. community spread remains rampant, what‚Äôs happening continue on. Taiwan shuttle special taxi directly designated quarantine hotel, give phone track check daily.

It's 14 days, worth imo. get it, Americans hate government, sometimes needed. one times. Thank you, sorry, question meant ask was: hasn‚Äôt antibody producing effect evidenced stage 2, we‚Äôre waiting human safety results, reversed? That‚Äôs true feel free provide sources.

This actually thing great job spotting discrepancy. title post adjusted post taken down. violation rule 2 sub. title post exactly article. editing title makes post seem interesting actually misleading. Exactly this! Nova Scotia quite centralized around Halifax, smaller towns dotted around province Halifax major city-like area. say Sydney well still quite small considered city. that, largest city Atlantic provinces see lot pull rural areas NS NB, PEI, NFLD well. know many people across eastern Canada here.

So think worth celebrating city around size London ON, Surrey BC, Quebec City QC, province centralized small, low numbers. mean look active case numbers Canada.ca website, almost every province thousands Atlantic provinces single digits. We're something right.

We can't celebrate YET though. over. look NS NFLD's curve, flattened hardcore. PEI's curve weird cumulative low case number recent cases, NB weird spikes due incidents low cumulative case numbers, NFLD NS really impressively flat curves. Lol how? Trump even spewing propaganda Canada? know even people fly Confederate flags head scratcher. ‚ÄúDuh‚Äù tagline entire fucking sub since March think 30-60 pretty pessimistic based data accompanying primary Phase I/II endpoints. I‚Äôd cautiously wager 60-70% efficacy least, others (Gottlieb, Fauci) said similarly unless I‚Äôm much mistaken. I'm first paragraph. saying need ""learn live virus"" patently absurd statement denegrates devalues lives 190k Americans already died, untold numbers people maimed unpredictable number die maimed try live it.

We need minimize many people die figure eradicate it. economy damned, human lives always take precedence business concerns. ***ALWAYS***. ""When asked many people died soon, Dr Tegnell said, ""Yes, absolutely."" 

From one American another, get yourself. feelings! tell theyre acting irresponsibly feel bad :( Vietnam also small isolated nation, mountainous. extremely cheap you‚Äôre getting return They're MAYBE sending vaccine approval year's end. 

Approval probably take month riot movement begun protest? Honest question 1% admitted hospital. sure percentage admitted hospital reason 15% rings bell. that‚Äôs case .15% overall.

it means also *driving* drinking age, gave plenty opportunity get DUI even went people take cars college even do, still walk. Bars college towns tend parking, drive wanted to.

I guess depends went school. I've large small campuses throughout oklahoma/kansas/arkansas/texas/colorado region (i live oklahoma), went plenty bars day (both school, wasn't, college-going friends), *always* drove.

the bars question almost *always* 2+ miles away, sometimes more.

I've walk home drunk bar (or often house party) 2 miles many occasion.

so act like dumbass Thanks driving point home. isn't, contrary, many scientists said everything know virus genetics indicate virus arose naturally, without signs associated human engineering.
 joke old. Go home.   Along everyone else also increasing cases.  Don‚Äôt even start lol assume PhD biochemistry/molecular biology focus virology, MD focus infectious diseases. Oh don't? Well I'm glad think opinion subject matters!

Stay lane total lack Federal leadership. high cost electing grifting carnival barker top job. Wrong.

There's still zombie horde massing borders. can't silence scientists, probably can't pay pharma companies enough reputation tarnished. Yeah that‚Äôs 60 000 excess deaths reported COVID deaths US back beginning August. 

As far know, it‚Äôs case us Canada, Ontario takes long releasing numbers Quebec surprisingly less excess deaths COVID deaths.

Also come warmer climates, snow terrible reminder every year seasons look like whatever want whatever want obvious Ok. see point now. Good luck! breathing? Oh cool south maybe luck rub us soon imagine sane part global citizens gladly paying it. would expect number heart attacks, strokes, serious infections, unexplained seizures, etc - population 100k. actually seen less one might expect. explanation many volunteers younger/healthy general.

Or perhaps completely shut things happen, instead there's least reason believe related vaccin? Countries took less action us right around death toll. send links gut tells excuse shit away, let's save time agree disagree. Agreed, necrotic leg kills us default. hope end needing two healthy legs escape something trying kill us. restrictions guidelines Sweden people refer ""lockdown"".
Ireland filled restrictions we're lockdown.

 allowed leave house reason except essential services, exercising within 2km house, lockdown. Safe whom, exactly? conveniently forgot Florida Texas fastest growing rate infection. Expected mushroom two weeks Labor Day. Yeah get title. guess term wave surge precisely defined....but looking deaths cases clearly two spikes US currently decline second one. Seems unlikely shut every times someone gets sick. 

There must reason think might related vaccine, that's investigated. wexit nutbars. fear. changing live awhile greater good. give eating restaurant, still getting takeout support them, slow spread disease deadly many, that. That's hard. 
 Folkss like reason many us can't things actually hard. Like able travel visit 85 year old mother law. everyone would make small sacrifices, numbers would lower could feel comfortable going see without risking life ""Task force teams give extra assistance least affected COVID19 ignoring affected."" I‚Äôm sure rules U.K. US would able discussed long personally identifiable info released. hate say it, best businesses going need pivot survive.

To though? Takeout exactly pivot. reality pivot many restaurants fail. big chains existing take joints survive fine local independent sit places hurt badly. Yeah right what? exactly truth. better ten guilty persons escape one innocent suffer.  Germany can't nice things American. ""ITS FUCKING EMBARASSING!!"" *KICKS TRASH CAN* Well wait, symptoms illness? something happened result exposed vaccine unrelated? result combination vaccine underlying condition within patient? overwhelming hospitals BARE FUCKING MINIMUM. Giving high-five people dying COVID orderly fashion we're cautionary tale whole planet. That's entire point. Oh. donate? Ahh fuck moving next week Oregon, too.  ""For comparison, Sweden, lock whose citizens comply mask wearing, death rate 58.0 per 100k""

Incorrect. Society lockdown. Take look universities here, example. offices. (hint: they're online work-from-home)

Masks recommended little proof efficacy. people ""not complying"" mask mandates. mask mandates fear mask mandates leads less efficient social distancing. Maybe instead students turn brains spread virus left right? setting future generations expect everything nothing.

I think many people already there. Yeah, requires selective pressure. virus spreads ahead symptoms takes weeks kill doesn‚Äôt much selecting lower virulence. good back went first cruise. Carnival exact. 

The room alright, destination ports fine. people ship issue. eat factor biggest (pun intended) issue them, one completely unexpected for. aware buffets magnitude behavior saw. Grown adults order 2-3 steaks time, 2-3 lobsters time, drinking oblivion. Whole NYC pizzas available 24/7 saw soooo many half eaten pizzas laying place. remember vividly larger couple ordering one every single dessert ""sampling"" them. Like normal restaurant would ordered twenty desserts $10 apiece? think covid 19 behave conoraviruses? Florida averaging almost 10,000 day times July 3,600 yesterday....so yeah, cases still falling. others psychological risks continuing live abnormally seem high.

Those people wrong then. can‚Äôt magically ‚Äúlive normally‚Äù right now, stuffs normal. virus there, it‚Äôs dangerous.

Most people, kids dependents, take risks. They‚Äôre responsible welfare others take responsibility seriously. one right mind would risk exposing families novel virus that‚Äôs killed almost 200k. Oh wow. I've hearing whole time non profit. 

According Astra's website they're going supply 400 million doses Europe profit. maybe misunderstood non profit case Europe. Man you‚Äôre really hurting feelings here. What‚Äôs wrong? Thank you! think could forgive something happened guest result wedding, want whatever make people feel safe. I've worrying offending people cut guest list, reading comment makes feel like maybe people relieved understanding safety Apology accepted, grandparents there, seen that, done that. Besides that, fine number nutjobs right moment too. thread - 

Article: Dispite media conception parties college students responsible spread coronavirus mostly they're forced work high risk jobs

Reddit: LOL read, fuck college students partying much i‚Äôm pretty sure tests accompanied database records results contact tracing.

no results entry. 

for sporting events test that‚Äôs nearly instantaneous better solution. 

like something right enter get results minutes.

and i‚Äôm worried family gatherings sporting events. let‚Äôs get people comfortable seeing families first. Thank you. curious related. Except me!!! HALP!! There‚Äôs crazy people here! Superpowers worlds best healthcare industry can, yeah rules everyone NA Europe let's compare US Europe developed nations. Still, US (and southern states) fared worse Europe developed nations world.

Just wanted point initial comment southern states much better Europe true. I‚Äôm joking need apologies! I‚Äôm happy all. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised. Canadians met online gaming visiting Las Vegas always kind. Seems simple human kindness play role scenario like one.  That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôve always wondered can‚Äôt see hope comes block option. You‚Äôd think due number stalkers creeps using harass track people they‚Äôd feature already. wedding getting moved around COVID, able go see movies theaters, maybe can‚Äôt travel much usually do, don‚Äôt mind new normal. Wearing mask fine. comfortable one. work home, enjoy. save money things can‚Äôt anymore. improving cooking I‚Äôve read books ever. can‚Äôt change fact COVID exists want continue safe responsible. I‚Äôve made best bad situation think great job. New normal alright.

Edit: forgot reddit hates anyone isn‚Äôt suffering Reading?! thought Amurica!!  comment needs correction. Fauci say it. ""Previous corona patient's lung working 200% capacity vaccine. Doctors shocked."" Kekarinos Wow. Fucked head? really wish you‚Äôd meet actual conservative real life one day. caracature you‚Äôve created leading dark path. Covid achieve self-awareness smoke wild fires truly disappointed 2020. know believe anymore!! like choice actually read article!!! Thanks link  people shit talking government government. Maybe GOP hadn‚Äôt spent infinite energy besmirching anything resembling good governance, people country would faith government. they? Depends material, look filtration studies Two masks totally fine long achieve good fit around face (if gaps face mask, air would go gaps avoid filtration) least students getting education.  Physically seeing picking groceries best, one me. everything closed, closest thing normalcy me, therapeutic. Nope. Build smaller wall around Austin periodically airlift supplies in. people get enough sun. Deficiency extremely high every demographic except white people living near tropics/equator. I'm man job. Here: ""They prove related vaccine, thus vague statement. decided continue now. Another similar adverse event happen vaccine go bin.""

Half joking, hope happen. ‚ÄúBlowing trials fast possible‚Äù ‚Äî how? explain this? Give details? doubt it. It'd great, suddenly make rest year fantastic 28 days later, get 2nd shot.

can make 27 29 days please? know support in-door dining, even social distancing limited capacity. Even outside, surprise likely eating friends family live with. 

Don't get started possibility dirty cups, dishes, utensils recent downsizing. I'm sure that. farily well uni lot peers 4.0'd engineering degrees got rejected med school interviews. I'm saying impossible become doc Canada dating several RNs think even understand grind med school. 4 people know went med, 3 left Canada rejected here. I‚Äôm also planning (totally outdoor) wedding - end July (everything pre COVID booked January 2020). think it‚Äôs important remember ‚Äúold normal‚Äù consists going movie theatres, packing sports stadiums, live concerts, festivals, etc. absolutely see possible end 2021. However, think reasons optimistic smaller gatherings, like weddings, able go forward. 

I‚Äôm planning Plan B case can‚Äôt, similar plan is, plain postpone- make call ~March depending things look. Everyone‚Äôs health top priority.

Sending positive vibes way :) U.S. get back normal late 2021, Fauci says

How possible people still believing 'return normal' concept? normal now.  Yes alcohol takes 30 seconds achieve high kill rate. Anything higher 70% stay surface long enough. Thank ‚Äî much appreciate clarity. even read said? ""You people"" 2x 911 every week... reasons lack cases epidemiological competence practical caution; result much pressure rush things. great factors getting right approval, even limited watching someone else's studies approving someone else's vaccine. just, like, positive little bit? happy? Thx article says false negative comes testing people early late 1990's. Yes this. That‚Äôs idea. last 2031 2020 doesn‚Äôt count. we‚Äôll worry climate change shit partying systems. understanding Pfizer generated high antibody levels sterilising immunity, Oxford slightly lower antibody levels higher T-cell response also sterilising immunity. incorrect? can't find reference sterilising immunity Pfizer. Protection lower respiratory system (no pneumonia), total resistance coronavirus infection upper respiratory system. Still strongest candidate undoubtedly."
