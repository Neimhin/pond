0,2021-09-26,"  Probably never, proof it’s needed.  eat dinner tonight? millions children starving Afghanistan Yemen. Projection part GOP real. Even rich people won’t get ECMO. They’re intensive also risky require 1:1 nursing care ECMO trained nurse, supervision perfusionist, Cardiothoracic surgeon cannulate patient, ECMO center access actual ECMO machine aren’t plentiful supply. don’t things, patient die complication. It’s something short staff consequences. We’re ECMO center waitlist patients 20’s 30’s devices occupied still getting transfer requests states due occupied everywhere. best chance person get ECMO right later term pregnant it’s coming “most good” point back up? Plateau? live high risk people? no, it’s dumb. Go get there! Wait, exactly hospital tells you, get tested contact doctor come case warning signs. think you’re conflating overall vaccination rates eligible vaccination rates US countries mentioned.  Seems consistent thinking conspiracy hoax give 5G go running treatment soon feel little shortness breath. one I’ve waiting for.. really bad data show vaccination safe pregnant women also shown increase miscarriage rates. data Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines. CDC source:  Im glad least noticing...    completely wrong. might 80% cases due asymptotic transmission, almost people wind symptoms point. might number comes from; bulk COVID transmission takes place symptoms show up, generally symptoms *will* show up. IIRC, less 20% people truly asymptotic. [The Diamond Princess study around Dave Blakes end, made prediction see cases hospitalizations continue decline Halloween.     Dollar signs free vaccine? Terrorist attacks vaccination sites, that's already happened. Ivermectin thing probably confusing thing confusing stuff.

How hell convince someone ""these companies trying sell drugs- stick buying *other* drug *other* company!""

I get it. sincerely doubt that, least United States, anyone put time money needed get medical school residency going leave profession.

Anecdotally: best friend roommate doctor. know *lot* young doctors. None burned COVID. However, many come certain ambivalence: wear masks outside, care get unvaccinated people sick. I've heard residents audibly mock unvaccinated patients they've attended ICU. 

I'm *sure* people, though, left medicine, considered leaving. think they're anywhere near representative whole. Man lot mind. It’s 65+, anyone 18-64 underlying condition list (including BMI 25 74% America is, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, 8 others), anyone high risk occupational institutional settings. Probably 90% America qualifies one way another.  I’m thinking like statewide election Governor Senator Wisconsin next year. could easily decided 5,000-10,000 votes, Republicans continue outpace Democrats COVID deaths next year, could deciding factor outcome elections. Hope feel better. unwell feeling short lived, like 1-2 days. Sounds like past worst part it. No, doctor’s office taking Covid patients, go “clinic.” conspiracy theory: Joe Rogan fully vaccinated never Covid. wanted attention faking politicalized infection - one wildly varying degrees severity - easy free way get ton media coverage. Exactly. controversy, takeaway ""great, controversy"" weird. fuckups scream shout made care - want kid vaccinated good news. ...and nothing value lost. God great! Good sure that. thought healthcare workers people 65  ""Why engines keep seizing up?""

- man never changes oil, ignores CHECK ENGINE light Jiffy Libs.   He’s getting ECMO. open machines waitlist 20 30 year olds. facility people waitlist 10 days taken even still consistent one 10-15 people daily. Getting transfer requests several states away well. That’s one really sad parts job lately families ask loved ones considered tell even candidate machines available people already waiting. hope future HCA Good bot first time anyone said ""days"". ""In coming weeks"" recent optimistic time frame Pfizer claimed this. like fluuuuu /s don’t think it’s fair seeing coworkers get paid half day go get tested toil away, let’s hope shakes right way! Coughing side effect vaccine, think nephew probably also ought get covid test right away.

There zero possibility transferring sickness vaccine, except theoretical ""sympathy pain"" kind way, example seeing loved one headache may cause experience headache. vaccine contains even inactivated whole virus (which one way make vaccines, Sinovac made way, 3 approved US). US vaccines cause make one 28 viral proteins, way going replicate sicken contagious.  nice side benefit regular masking winter people would stockpiles production capacity would stay around, next serious airborne pandemic, we'll supplies. scrabbling try make sure COVID doctors wear disposable mask weeks straight due shortages. immediate aftermath (hours days) vaccine, body sending blood, along immune cells blood, deal foreign protein start immune response. causes inflammation, including localized pain, heat, swelling. remember exactly culture was, want say Brazil, interview Orson Scott Card publicist mentioned funeral ritual woman whose husband vile beat praised good husband asked said ultimate revenge erasing actually replacing something better would forgotten. means let's forget Ben Carson actually replace memory something better, deserve remembered. worries. They’re trapped job due exorbitant student loans. dumb plan trip Florida beginning January? theory, delta wave passed lots people would natural immunity.

Obviously new variant would cause problems assuming new variant emerges, dumb idea fully vaccinated person? Let's see Trump feels Oh no. So, anyway. ""whistleblowers"", they're completely nuts, unfortunately convincing anti-vaxxers lives one worst hit parts MT right now. hospital even room anyway. Sorry posted old article, feel like solution pandemic could hiding plain site. Nasal antiseptics, 12 hour protection, virus primarily infects thru nasal passage. Cheap simple, politics involved, perhaps could get R number 1 widespread use.

Studies use bacterial/staph show effective, vitro covid shows effective. (Nozin I'm using...alcohol studies preop use ""Medical Industrial Complex?"" Hate break him, think made horse dewormer? Everybody gangsta primal terror sets in. Went diet year. damn hard. least he’s intellectually consistent? know number Qultists believe humans naturally perfect snd never get sick - illnesses come doctors give disease pharmacists give poison medication. Soros Illuminati, like Hillary, Obama, Gates, Hanks, etc ordered kill portion population... Dentists ate involved well... Also, Qultists claim bathing bad kills germs strengthen immune system, umm, yeah. get sick say drink fruit juice use herbs. mean someone got vaccinated hour ago something? moron actually created pro ivermectin cartoon. fucking guy causes roll eyes aggressively actually hurts. don’t believe science all, need live cave without anything modern.  


Hunter gatherer days 10,000+ years ago. Thanks; I'm sure people situation would agree company make easier bear, though knowing others know feel pain consolation. Gotta wonder thinks Trump fully vaccinated. go get vaccinated, simple costs literally nothing. afraid virus afraid vaccine. can't understand one would test oneself weekly worry possible could TAKE VACCINE. Nolte argued partisan gap vaccination rates part liberal plot. Liberals like Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Anthony Fauci Howard Stern tried hard persuade people get vaccinated, know Republican voters opposite whatever say, 

If politicians etc telling get vaccinated well - seem content let librals win one.... weird   COVID test without insurance Deep South $85. correct getting voted clear people know data well.  Ok... still change fact particular article COVID affected America specifically. Everybody knows global pandemic (aside morons still think hoax) again, what's point?  Groups mentioned earlier:

Chronic lung disease: covered current third shot policy, unless serious immune deficiencies (or live nursing homes). Chronic lung disease covers huge variety diseases, including many little reduction immune system there's reason presume vaccine less effective ""ordinary"" people.

Cancer: third shot already covered cancer types result immune deficiencies, treatments result immune deficiencies. Unless belonging one groups, there's reason presume vaccine less effective ""ordinary"" people.

Multiple sclerosis: One diseases already covered current policy cases considered necessary (which likely depend exact variant, progress disease medication person receives). Unless belonging group, there's reason presume vaccine less effective ""ordinary"" people.

Dysfunctional immune systems: Already covered cases serious and/or necessary. Unless belonging groups, there's reason presume vaccine less effective ""ordinary"" people.

So, groups mentioned either already covered current third-shot policy, reason believe faster reduction vaccine protection people age group. first said couple months ago, Danish authorities keeping eye reduction protection groups national registry positive cases, hospitalizations, deaths, breakthroughs, antibodies blood donors, study initiated February thousands patients (general patients, covid patients) four hospitals monitored long-term (antibodies first shot, second shot, 3, 6, 12, 18 24 months, recent addition 8 10 months). also said page third shot people serious immune deficiencies, authorities expecting vaccine less effective people slight/moderate reduction immune system. begin observe reduction compared age group, data come. Exactly already happened people significantly reduced immune systems nursing home residents. standard Danish system entirely reasonable: presume change, *unless* informed authorities change. this, two examples exact same: healthy 35-year-old expect still receive reasonable protection first two vaccine shots (average similar others age group), unless informed change. 75-year-old slight/moderate reduction immune system expect still receive reasonable protection first two shots (average similar others age group), unless informed change.

The Danish authorities currently making detailed plan initiated if/when boosters remaining groups become necessary. typically ignore Ben Garrison backward ass politics, I've always ignored cartoons suck. good political cartoon need shitload text.

For illustration above, horse seen kicking Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation’s top infectious disease expert. cartoon horse appears “cents” symbol hooves shouts, “get horse sense!” kicks Dr. Fauci, who’s holding droopy needle dollar signs.

Why write point? cartoon keep Trump's attention longest millisecond?

OOH HORSEY doesnt deserve hospital bed.  told covid 19 knew certain, covid mask cover eyes body. Long sleeve shirts gloves otoh cover arms really seem interfere nonverbal communication.

Deaf people able lip read problem, easy adapt such. hard hearing always directly ask people temporarily move masks needed they're totally deaf that's already going make verbal communication difficult. Written language also option. 

Language barriers nearly much concern hospitalization deaths: people difficulty hearing elderly people, many much higher risk serious outcomes. Lots people know different languages language barriers huge issue often. 

Also, masks pretty normal depending activity done, culture, season. Meanwhile, shirts always normal we've adapted normal activities cultures. They're still annoying serve much less purpose wearing masks crowded areas disease outbreaks. Canada, Mexico country middle. Good, man conviction.

In 1700s London, England, 70-80% children died reaching 18 (TB epidemic). Prayer false gods/religions (all btw), didn’t help.

The human species due science. century multi-planetary.  Waves happen conditions change. arrival virus first wave 2020. Weather also one big cause waves, example summer 2020 southern states November February Northern states. Also changes mitigation policies (e.g. ""reopening"") cause waves. think wave going right delta variant arrival wave. Another wave waiting happen weather changes -- northern states cold flu season starting mid November people staying indoors also lower humidity.  yup, CCP decides locking 700M people least economically damaging choice, it’s probably pretty bad. wouldn’t say rn’s scientist. Yeah everyone’s responded pandemic, I’m pretty okay life expectancy shortened this. don’t need endure catastrophic events etc cohort. failed group activity.  reference Covid 4.7M now. I'd dart. Hmmm, wonder there's event history teachers could use future. woman class nurse rehab center people physical disabilities accidents. told third care personnel would quit get vaccinated. really hope covid tests faked, since sit class without masks (you vaxxed, tested recovered). difference make old people die are? regularly discriminate old people?

Not deaths equal...

An 80-year old may 2-5 years left ahead (and likely pleasant years). 30 year old life ahead him, leaving behind children,spouse, parents..

At personal level, would prefer die 80 25? know answer. Or, adjust slightly: given choice flu-of-1918 25 covid19 80 would think twice what's better option?

At social level, would prefer pandemic 100% 30 die pandemic 100% 80 die?

I really see anyone could question that...

PS. Fun fact: medical procedures rationed (e.g transplants) years-of-quality-life-left often becomes main factor who-gets-to-live decision.. countries people living warned months.

Now late get vaccinated, stupidity price.

I follow Romanian news discussion-fora even exponential growth infections deaths, people still yapping fake virus deadly vaccines false statistics are.

The (corrupt) officials countries really interested stopping either, real consequences people unvaccinated, effort shut subversive activities boldness make unpopular decisions combat spread properly. suppose way get jokers actually take vaccine, general demand within EU, regarding travel.

You really cannot win stupid suffer, droves. It’s people, like lot countries, sick taking precautions gone back living normal life. 

This especially true people vaccinated, false belief immune disease altogether whereas recent data shows otherwise. 

I’m seeing feed full graduate school educated persons going back music festivals, indoor weddings, football games, traveling world leisure getting shots. gotten shot. First hydroxochloroquine, ivermectin, gargling *iodine*, it’s hydrogen peroxide? What’s next, ketamine?    don’t know that’s media landed scientific basis. scientific reason think need annual boosters.    recent study specificity Covid-19:      No. let fucken it. sooner better. Well guess aren’t    think lot hesitant folk still specifically worried fact vaccines new. Distrust ""big pharma"" real. 

A focus safety, many people vaccinated (nearing half humanity), data gathered global scale, helped formulate treatments serious side-effects occur (myocarditis, clotting, etc), might help too. doesn’t ebola get really infectious you’re toilet shitting guts out?      Especially Hispanic households multiple generations often live together. case friend, work hospital. friend mine lost 3 family members two weeks. aunt two uncles. large funerals haven’t able grieve properly tiny funeral didn’t even feel like respectful farewell. aren’t even allowed grieving time pandemic, feels like constant tidal wave death. death least problems catch covid.  title probably best way phrase happening.

I've seen conservatives point lack logic firing healthcare workers refuse vaccinated deadly pandemic that's like shooting foot. really, lack logic belongs healthcare workers willing sacrifice jobs duties avoid protected pandemic. think missing point. point consider monkey randomly hitting keys keyboard infinite length time, infinite sequence random key presses eventually type every single permutation characters sequence long enough type Hamlet.

The whole scenario theoretical, theoretically true, it’s probabilities work. guaranteed. Covid terrible things people's bodies, often even mild cases. affecting pregnancies stretch all.       really amazing. Without medical background, pretty easy think through. vapor sort, magically seek Covid19 body eliminate it? Let inhale. Later. Dude dad would make us drink kids got sick lmfao learned recently turn blue it!  person higher chance passing someone around time, often family. number families lost multiple people likely significant.

So far threats panning high percentage eventually get vaccinated keep jobs.

Yet people still use hand sanitisers everywhere, lot shops/restaurants open windows anymore... people clearly wishing person die super fucked up. funniest part ivermectin much part medical industrial complex.

People aren’t used drinking partying perhaps bit enthusiastic time

Point is: Vastly exaggerated.  child left behind massively cut funding education, definitely started that. 

An ignorant public public that’s easy control. 

There’s also idea culture peak high school? seems many people high school believe longer need learn anything read anymore. what’s point? They’ve already passed prime (which apparently acne laden high school awkward faces)

It makes sense, weren’t raised think critically doesn’t get questioned. SARS, Zika, Ebola, aids, west Nile, swine flu. need forgive people thinking would blow over, need hold media accountable creating fuelling pandemic panic 20 years leading covid19. boy cried wolf old story, yet are.

The number media panics subjected last 40 years, lasting effects made painfully clear. suffering consequences now.

I assumed another one too. ignored it, downplayed right Italy went tits up. Well, problem actually authority it, thought step down. Antivaxxx people.  Interesting. honestly idea nurses get paid. field needs attract intelligent candidates, guess wages requisite qualifications would need go up. easy nut crack. [Statistical tendency toward enlarged Good. leave space who've made effort. People like never learn, they? Ebola super gross it’s pretty contagious people taking care sick patients. Hard part patients similar symptoms stomach flus like would hard tell sick something goin go kill you. least wasn’t super contagious unless actively sick. hospitals across US prepared increased contamination training procedures. Even nurse caring one? Patient states actually got it. scary part. would really risking life care patient likely die. interesting ethical situation. cruise ship needed coming dock sick passengers actual Ebola cases would crazy guarantee everyone ship would quarantined eventually died there.   big thing remember better now, isn’t necessarily Covid isn’t bad Spanish flu. medical system much better it’s even comparable. ￼if stuck 1918 medicine we’d much worse off.     Pay nurses gone like crazy. issue lack candidates, lack intelligent candidates. Remember, nursing students common trade apprentices police officers doctors. 

There always exceptions rules, there's reason doctors covid vaccination rate north 95% nurses hovered mid 50s mandates.  Back early 2000s, dated woman nurse wages pretty shitty then, seen sign they've improved, and, based follow social media, lot hospitals trying squeeze work pandemic without much increase pay.

It seems best paying nursing jobs travel jobs, temporary jobs pay well cover housing (and sometimes expenses), also require lot work you, often times night shift, really give whole lot long term security.

Also important remember term ""nurse"" covers range people different credentials educational backgrounds training. also two different viruses different spreading mechanisms. starters, Ebola isn’t known spread asymptomatic cases, requiring symptoms disease mechanism spread it. also isn’t aerially transmitted like COVID is, much easier manage spread sense.    ain’t part yo system, phonies. guess going long Winter northern hemisphere. route Covid appears long lasting immunity result infection. countries likely position around year now. many people possible vaccinated many times necessary protect inevitable infection. problem statistically survive he'll credit ivermectin root juice. Yeah, I’m sure denial right word either, never expected get control last long. happened wages nurses? gone time reflect incredible amount stress hardship brave workers faced pandemic?

Perhaps nursing paid more, would attract candidates, would larger pool choose from. Would funny see brains melt.

The ‘illegals’ wouldn’t able spread Covid anymore vaccinated government also able track using micros chips implanted vaccine. However stealing vaccines made USA hardworking Americans.

I think might explode  actual virus bunch less-common effects, including fertility issues, folks seem started blaming vaccine, quick googling shows l, least far, evidence support this:  It’s combo vax rates, mitigation strategies, luck. Florida relatively highly vaccinated huge delta spike. Maine highly vax’d people may taking precautions. people generally good masking social distancing Maine? nurses awesome job highly skilled do. However take 2 year nursing associate's plus deference patients give sign they've learned know medical science -- therefore start thinking fully qualified understand medical research public health policy. Really think deep understanding basic medical training plus large helping intuition facebook memes.  That's kind point. govt done half assed job along way STILL okay now. go full restrictions... let ignorance disinformation spread... everyone pays price. Accepting illness could prevent doesn’t sound healthy me. friends family come cold, flu, Covid illness don’t to? 

Let’s real. Covid virus keep hitting us face masks likely new normal. Mmmm they’re certain age. vaccine may approved 13+, I’m sure children anti-vax parents get it… I’d hate someone finally turn 18, fo find vaccine costs money now. Delta spreading fast + people tired social distancing.

Now, remaining hope ongoing vaccination campaign would reduce R value. majority 19-49 age group still fully vaccinated yet. kill tho. yucky. Ontario far reactive, implemented form vaccine passport Biolytics Canada. developing them. HIV one already out, covid soon. Pretty sure almost done trials, already exists.

See wouldn’t even say denial since also knew people Wuhan took seriously, way expected last 2+ years. Imagine studies find developing countries. ""The news""? actually incorrect common life expectancy measurement (known ""period life expectancy""), derived age-specific mortality rates measured given time period (typically year): COVID long-term effects totally disappear December 31, 2021, measured life expectancy 2022 would immediately return 2019 levels.

However, cohort life expectancy (which measures average age death people born specific year, say 1950) contains data every year start cohort end (when last member cohort dies). COVID would adversely affect cohort life expectancy permanent way.

One pitfalls ""period life expectancy"" fails account future changes mortality (such decreased mortality due advances healthcare). even period life expectancy given year 75, children born year almost certainly live 75 years average long healthcare continues improve. Yeah, chose attend concert despite fact. idiotic. Mandates social consequences seem effective, non-oppressive way. Hey, choice want not, here's things going work on:  

If vaccinated, following : work earn income, eat restaurant, drink bar, visit people, parties, clubs, concerts, events, sports, shopping, groceries, etc.

If not, here's shorter list do: go walks, camping (one household only).

H1N1 pandemic vaccinated 80 million people 3 months. basic dinner plank fish, baby potatoes, salad. super easy throw fish potatoes pizza stone oven. put olive oil good balsamic salad. various olives sometimes feta it, too.

For breakfast we'll often *little bit* rice, chicken, bunch greens, maybe soup. soup usually broth combination squash, zucchini, potato, spinach, random root veggies. little bit rice, mean like 1/2 cup most. greens: spinach, kale, chard. take entire bunch per person (the size normal bunch get grocery store) put pot cook tiny bit water bottom stick dry out. I'll put variety sauces they're almost done cooking flavor. They've become favorite part meal.

I beans fodmap issues.

We drizzle good olive oil everything. Dairy mostly out, except maybe little feta salad flavor. big thing carbs, moderation. half cup pasta side, instead base whole meal. whole bowl oatmeal. That's straight carbs. Vegetables make bulk everything. Meat mostly fish chicken fried breaded.

The great thing Mediterranean food tastes fantastic tons flavor. ""If vaccinated already, keep good work. vaccinated, might good time start. ""

Makes perfect sense” first world countries be.   cultural differences Black, Latino White Americans American-born families living US generations great cultural differences immigrants raised totally different societies

This subjective, kind offensive. think 150 million people died vaccine America? leave house? Cause traffic would first clue true.

Apparently make lasting impression. there's hospitalization, would agree. However, even vaccinated getting hospital dying virus. greatly reduces chances dying going hospital, invincible. Thus, using logic, wear masks.  Ngl, beginning, think gonna blow over.

Me, too. seen flus come go before, thought blown proportion. one week March sports teams cancelled everything (NBA game moments tipoff), Tom Hanks caught blasted every news channel, road traffic congestion started dropping cliff.

Hmm. again, maybe bad rates would go down. :D Ebola actually incubation period 2-21 days, pretty similar COVID regard, initial symptoms super obvious- aches, pains, fatigue, fever,-generic viral infection symptoms.

Be interesting see many peer-reviewed academic papers used. guessing zero. zero peer-reviewed academic papers supporting idiocy. I'm going human magnet!

No transpantation without reasonable assurance success 59 insane, I'm used like 20 max GP still can't grok 140 *with insurance*

Hell point I'd say would better without almost. Theres this. true. delta variant seems virulent meaning virus amount days prior covid infections… long haulers people covid didn’t die mainly asymptomatic still lost lung function… like 30% something. patients prior delta patients didn’t even show signs covid… Americans overweight big risk factor…. poorer outcomes… combined delta variant virulent that’s great…. ? 75 pretty early, dad 65 can't imagine dead 10 years.

Both grand parents lived 90 last years felt really rough, I'd say 85 good depends person, I'd say time go get severe disease like terminal cancer 
Both grand parents severe disease never really hospitalized intensive care last year  Zydrate comes little glass vial. That's pretty insane, work pretty regular job US, doctor visit 20 bucks long specialist (40 then) also 12k deductible, never even hit kid despite making ton appointments otherwise (for hand, hip, ect)

I call decent job best healthcare offer catastrophic minimum. Like mean *okay* money best I'm dropping 5 bucks 30 day script. entirely, shots except covid ones, parents shots know lot people serious side effects still dealing them. mind getting shot want send message, let people know people vaccinate necessarily stupid know different. would like see world people vaccinated would need so, die, end day, can't force parents anyone else think different already reasons.

If end losing basic human rights take shot wait see happens next, I've corona 3 weeks ago reacted pretty good, lost sense smell, anti-bodies right hopefully I'll safe everything goes back normal.

So yeah, anti-vaxx, anti bullying people opinion, still believe people get basic vaccines long.

I believe science, trust WHO, biggest fear need get one shot every six months keep basic human rights.

No hate, hope get trying say :)  agree 💯. I'm @93! FFS, want around 42 years Water Wars still flying cars. IIRC, kidneys special way. Soemthing well-differentiated nearby tissue obvious connections (nerves, blood vessels, etc) everything (relatively) straight forward. diminish effectiveness vaccine? Getting two time, opposed one. Stop hiring dumb cops respect choice admire continued attempts convince them. I’ve lost patience trying convince people, point. compassion understanding nonexistent people see destruction variant causing still actively choose part problem. Maybe it’s wrong don’t want people life.    getting last unvaccinated people. Also, people vaccinated getting mild infections number people separated overall numbers.  still extremely uncommon, news articles case.
But yes new variants seem agressive young people older variants basically completely harmless young people forget mental illness young people pushing bodies limit get We've tried nice approach. Force that's left Yeah kinda like ""noooo"" going up. clicked would occasionally take pill xanax like 5 years back, maybe every 1-3 months. knocked 9 years  wish half many articles selfless, life saving medical professionals working tirelessly behaving responsibly. Instead constantly platform legitimize people read one many Facebook posts. Well many places country don’t require masks despite CDC recommends. It’s simple me: wear mask places require one. don’t places don’t. also don’t wear mask outdoors. Hum... still think 78% population fully vaccinated might enough that.

I'm Portugal, almost 85% still think we're going fast opening country (new changes applied October 1st, search see).

Anyway, congrats Spain amazing job vaccination considering 4.5 times population have! part essential list

I actually even shared  hate I’m going say isn’t joke. Two cousins live Idaho (they 30 asthma) get vaccine think make infertile. America like this. Nature healing hope asked check you. We're number one, we're number one!!

/s obviously fucking can't stand selfish assholes  Exactly, jobs procedural. well france isn´t case anymore. lets say, still nurses, unpaid leave.  Hey man, calm down. What's reason hate?

I PT working Rehab, get fair share cases.
8 weeks coma means loss basically muscle mass. people still wheelchair 5-6 months catching infection.
Their lungs scarred never recover fully.
Every new “harmless” infection like flu dangerous them.
To recover went would train year.
Some neurological damage making recovery even harder.
Their overall life expectancy easily dropped 5-10 years estimate.
The biggest risk even younger patients falls associated fractures leads complications bodies can’t cope anymore. Key word deadliest, necessarily worst, deadliest meaning killed most, full stop. Ok.

You're exactly type person talking lol, thanks providing example. simplistic incomplete way interpreting number due medical advancement increased resources available try combat disease. 

We live age widely available intensive care units complete modern ventilators, vasopressors, allied health professionals hundred years advances medical science. without even mentioning lower level medical care saved countless lives commodified liquid oxygen, pulse oximeters every antibiotic currently use. 

We also discuss advances epidemiology allowing flattening curve varying degrees well marvel covid vaccine development. 

In 1918 99% ICU level patients would died well substantial portion simply requiring hospitalisation. 

A good comparison would natural disasters. Something like tsunami much worse days lot mortality prevented seismic activity monitoring ability put warnings. 

To honest difficult draw comparison world different absolutely major milestone remember thinking start last year far away 1918 numbers seemed. honest quite surprised see third per capita death rate. 😂😂😂 Sperm vaccinated? That's really loose term using. define ""protection"". talking severe disease? Symptomatic infection? infection? Ability transmit disease?

If assumption made two doses makes safe getting others sick getting sick yes, time matters protection transmitting contracting covid wanes time. need become zero issue. think good analogy would safety inspections car. car going cause potential harm others last year, mean still road safe. ""freedom take vaccine"" exists, although bit controversial middle pandemic.

Still, I'm relieved see many people Brazil willing take vaccine despite president have.

Good luck ""os portuga"" diseases cures thought them? Normalcy.  next one count bad actors making pandemic go longer to.  thought we'd way normalcy vaccines came out.   Everyone shooting summer 2021.   would people got vaccinated  watched wresting PPV Ohio many unmasked people crowds, adults children :( Hopefully least requirements large events like Fire morons ban asses ICU get sick covid. fed fools That´s it. I´m also fed masks I´m looking forward go back normal.

Besides would least maintain everybody vaccinated. Afterwards would wise mask sick least (look flu almost vanished also, it´s good public health measure prevent covid). Dammit. Beat 7 minutes. Take upvote. yes, realise it’s complete solution, thought motivate rebellious anti-authority types get vaccinated. Something paid appears value something pushed free. Lol shocking they’re type people call “healthcare heroes” LOL Irish Times running this... Maybe trust japanese mask public places even slightly sick .

I, based I´ve seen, don´t trust spanish compatriots voluntarily it, masking manadatory least children vaccinated vulnerable ppl get booster, needed. Yeah did, kept cases low scientists refer “the exact opposite Gladys Berejiklian would do”. depends many different things. 

But Ontario 1.5 cases covid per 100,000 people vaccine. 

With vaxx, 11.99 cases per 100,000  Except 65 highest covid vaccination rates....approx 95.6%

Not stats vaccines came out. 65 group driving covid numbers anymore. 

Lowest vax rates u.s. 18-24. 25-39. ( counting 12 age group ) I'm okay that. 

I'm also okay putting fuckers list never find work healthcare again. obviously cannot trusted provide proper care 

Good riddance. Everything's bigger Texas. 🤠 award $500B grant wild, yet intriguing, research. also group discovered cacti spines sharp? Oh, we're going back 80s pretend AIDS exist again? Nice work.

Your entire comment predicated assumption I'm saying infection effective reliable vaccine. I'm saying that. I'm saying natural immunity induced infection better vaccine induced immunity. 

The article linked says natural immunity last 8 months, far recent source published Nov 2020. UK allows NHS Covid passport 6 months positive PCR.

Even true vaccines provide longer lasting immunity, 'longer lasting' mean antibodies remain circulating body longer. still immunity via memory cells regardless.

Obviously natural infection alone can't curb recurrent waves. vaccinate much quicker virus spread. UK we've 7 million cases 44 million vaccinations. absolutely nothing point. Survivorship bias means nothing either, cause I'm saying *given* natural immunity, better (conditional).  year younger looks 15 years older me... Fine, respect it. also conflate vaccines given children several decades study behind adult assessing risks covid three vaccines work well natural immunity, small fraction research efficacy results behind them, ones cited comparison. population lower.  Orlando VA Healthcare System seen sustained decrease COVID-19 hospitalizations past couple weeks decommissioned mobile ICU effective today,” wrote spokesperson Heather Frebe. “We sufficient staff clinical resources manage current hospital operational requirements. continue encourage get COVID-19 vaccine.”  VA seen number active COVID-19 cases cut half 506 two weeks ago 222 Wednesday. Patients occupy 92% ICU beds, 22 24, 72% medical surgical beds, 98 136. Nine ICU patients COVID-19, 10 medical surgical patients COVID-19.

All would take slight uptake cases would right back were. sure dropping guard (again) right approach. Florida. You’re best- thank much!! virus doesn’t get antivaxxers stupidity seems trying finish job. stop expecting listen science won’t get vaccine want everyone to? Injecting vaccine bloodstream instead tissue (easily preventable error cases) lead loss platelets, needed normal blood clotting.  already vaccines mandatory?  Holy fuck. Honestly, think hard choice. truly lose ~15% workforce hospitals, quality care probably decreases far (across board, every health outcome) increased risk patients catching covid unvaccinated workers (half might already natural immunity; could wear masks reduce transmission). Unpopular opinion, think really clearcut patient risk / outcome perspective. aspirate pre-plunge - simple cure. CDC recommends aspirate beyond comprehension. Alaska full uneducated conspiracy theorist type people  Oh lord!! hell idiots NOW? Little kids chowing random paste tablets.

I'm Oregon that's live got shot free got insurance year new job. 

I many uninsured friends got vax free. Oregon.

The covid vaccine free Oregon. words sound nice antimaskers militant stance even attacked people masks, either verbally physically. We're completely free pandemic yet. even propose easing masking rules even know things stand? access special inside information?  There's also way people country. Let's spread misleading statistics, giving fuel anti maskers/vaxers. Minus brain matter changes seeing even mild cases... Probably going want get even mild one possible. Life need go on, need better therapeutics preventative measures asap. everyone got covid let god sort out, would survival fittest. virus missed plenty mentally deficient assholes taking teacher wearing mask social distancing.

Politicians also finger scales epidemic failing implement covid requirements result people getting infected otherwise wouldn't. people down-voting this? NYT pretty bad practice moral relativism masquerading journalism. noted, pattern coverage. probably biggest mystery pandemic.

If can't get tested...  COVID rates Africa example extremely low compared United States, yet vaccination Africa vastly lower.

No one get COVID test many parts Africa. Quiet obedience makes boring people.

Not there's anything wrong that.  Honestly, want treatment health care worker refuses get vaccinated chances catching spreading patients.  Canada entered chat. 

I've never paid vaccine. medical care. 

My tax rate three states US (I'm dual). analysis assumes infection less serious unimportant, don’t data support either.

That's I'm trying say - I'm saying observational studies asymptomatic/mild infections unreliable, people different reasons get tested (mostly, I'd assume someone want vaccine care covid much get tested mild symptoms). hospitalizations, behavioral patterns less important - people go get treatment can't breathe. So, get good idea vaccines, boosters asymptomatic/mild infection, would need experimental study participants get systematically tested, want to. that's yet.

I agree downsides small, US probably see wave later year, due vaccination rates risk age groups remaining low much country. Maybe booster helps you, maybe doesn't. Right? per-capita numbers thing matters comparing something like this

Anti-vax nurses forced new hires option. thinks 15,000 people died COVID vaccine. He's crazy.  COVID's greatest power 80% asymptomatic rate (not equitably distributed age comorbidity). allows infect enormous numbers people silently without carriers taking precautions they're often unaware. person may may symptomatic group may may need hospital care 20%. made news makes likely symptomatic, far guarantee he'll need hospitalization.

EDIT: 80% rate something read long ago keep information improved. studies map asymptomatic rate. Here's one 2021-08-24 (pretty recent) 35.1%: like idea *not* getting infected person trying treat something. cdc says ""Aspiration injection vaccines toxoids (i.e., pulling back syringe plunger needle insertion injection) necessary large blood vessels present recommended injection sites"".

Is scientifically correct reason aspirate? Survival fittest implying Black Latino populations US haven’t retained distinct cultures whitewashed.

I've implied thing. inferred bias. 

I've never said cultural difference Blacks Whites US, Blacks totally assimilated. teach US history social studies, literally job know that. I've spent evening preparing lessons black social movement last decade (I think actually naming movement gets comments banned political here, know one mean). 

I'm arguing degrees cultural difference recent immigrants present greater differences compared older minority communities. original argument NZ homogenous society compared US, clearly not. walk class 30 students least 15 nationalities class several children immigrants. 

If we're arguing country structural racism, yeah US wins one hands down. remember absolute cringy comic trump boner...old fat ass probably can't even get up. NY.   live Ontario region roughly 650k people, daily case count 30. currently 3 people hospital.

Don't ask me, person replying active ""collapse"" subreddit, exactly might think People going keep dying this, ""Normal"" someone go movies die 2 weeks later it.

Nah he's always like this. He's worse others.   think boss work already started preparing us work home. keeping track COVID spreading China started stock piling food. soon first case reported US, assumed silently spreading throughout country despite Trump saying like 18 people go away next week. died result Covid vaccines hundreds thousands others serious side effects.

Even believe falsehood^*, that's still better odds virus killed 600,000 far, put millions hospital. even middle-school level math, 'which number bigger'.

What living? I'm curious.  able Twitter lmao.   Hey good job openings coming!    Goodbye, Ben. effort extend next four weeks. vaccine mandatory requirement attend school, authorities expect parents get informed authorize kids get jab.

In case teenagers 12, Health Ministry said 87% aged 16-17 already first dose, 81% kids aged 14-15 58% kids aged 12-13. 

Also 3 million adults already vaccinated booster dose. yeaaah he's actually horrible let get straight - he's Covid test self-diagnosing? self-medicating? someone else positive Covid test? ass. Oh, gets serious he'll definitely go hospital. there's one thing guys consistent at, giving fuck consistency messaging actions. What’s gunna amazing people try get job even require vaccinations :x Yes. saying comparison isn’t really accurate. numbers also worst year Spanish flu. continued kill people ever since. yet somehow *we're* ones allowed cross border... bad. 25% pf healthcare workers remain unvaccinated don’t always wear PPE especially nursing home settings. still going need play game, hopefully less anxiety. still need help reduce transmission getting tested cold symptoms. reminds 19th century political cartoons, y'know, invention mandatory school Liberals like Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Anthony Fauci Howard Stern tried hard persuade people get vaccinated, know Republican voters opposite whatever say, 

Lmao they're blaming stupidity liberals? course are. vaccination committee country recommended it, would certainly vaccinate too. however would basing whether truly need not. reason, US gives vaccines everyone without prioritising it.  Find new pediatrician. pediatrician takes precautions I’ve asked covid tell worry. There’s priorities kids. I'm siding virus one.  think fatal flaw extend sympathy towards 100% people shouldn’t feel ashamed don’t feel bad anymore happening people. It’s truly tragic…. reading prison deaths categorized “bad” people (like child molesters rapists/murderers above) still going “oh feel bad people passing”? Probably probably don’t sympathy extended would people. 

It truly sucks anti-vax/mask/whatever living Dark Ages 2021  Ok, hopefully realize die + get egregiously sick.

Not gonna bother arguing. going get even complicated ""best booster"" Moderna halving dose boosters, that's probably got lot difference. 

No idea they'd doubling profits. test multiple dosages find best one; tested 50ug. still higher Pfizer much. 

Switched Moderna booster glad got changed 50. whole comment chain train wreck. Surely even see that.  themselves. Well prioritse Africa time clearly need American children, simply high risk. I'm trying sound like Covid-denier, clear data rarely get seriously ill. vaccinate flu many viruses too.   result care semantics.  meant. Remember back discussions available doses, production sites, etc. know efficacy greatly differes, variants. Back could foresee this. small precision. ... original like? Cool cool. know needles already basically painless? fear irrational.... doubt replacing one big needle tons mirco needles change anything even painless. Schizophrenic man.     long deck CDC boosters. Blah blah blah 

I literally don’t give sh*t vaccinating kids first day it’s available. sad statement regarding situation US thought process “Oh, GOT Florida,.. oh good, it’s France!” anyone know studies done people original strain (SARS-CoV-2), recovered, get vaccinated efficacy antibodies new variants? 2.2 year reduction average life expectancy US Men. significant effect reduction deaths working age men (not ""old people going die anyway""). Comparatively, Denmark Norway **zero** reduction life expectancy Men Women.

If want know more, read [full sympathy covid/vax deniers. mean smartest idea get medical advice political commentators Facebook groups, still.

Now people spreading bullshit little sympathy for. wish suffering death people, hope everytime one public figures gets covid come Jesus moment followers come one-step closer facts.   comment gold. Thank incredibly difficult logistically get extra vaccines arms gotten single dose.

No, problem completely disregards rich countries buying supply problem. could easily vaccinate Africa. need vaccines it. horrendous trade make, keep chemo home wipe immune system COVID-19 kills can't fight off. take immune system cope COVID-19 Cancer in. political satire that’s genre cartoon style decades decades. agreed seems overtly labeled point looks cluttered. People think I'm joking tell even 0.1% cases surface transmissions.

Then show CDC's website literally saying still think I'm making lmao nurses short supply, don’t kind need vaccine hesitant ones?

I agree internal inconsistency saying Africa fine are, average, younger continent, also advocating vaccines used 5-11 year olds here. real issue that, said, majority doses go arms kids would otherwise wasted, rather rerouted internationally. logistically feasible go around collecting unused doses wherever U.S. sending abroad. diverting newly manufactured doses internationally, since excess ones sitting around. minimum, think total crap NBA follow NFL make unvaccinated pain ass.

So 0.5% ""US people partake elections"" died COVID, likelihood local hospitals really hold that.  contrarians scientifically proven vaccines fall crazy, mystery treatments like one proof Darwin's theory evolution absolutely true. unfortunate geniuses, many cases, already passed defective genes onto offspring. Pfizer, qualify booster based factors.

Edit: nvm, saw you’re Canada He's causing die misinformation. want people die, want less people die overall. evil people die causing rest society little better less deadly fatal misinformation, win us. saves people end.  Lol what? mean like vigilante vaccinating? hope upsell horse tranquilizers.  probably!

Here's state Oregon website vaccines says going happen. 1200 deaths small local county way high. 0.2% US population died Covid. Even assume every single one voted Republican, 0.2% blue shift barely statistical noise. boosters, arguable old people want protect safe enough. 4500 breakthrough deaths, 3900 . That's much less typical year's flu deaths (30,000-60,000).  


If there's argument masks public, diseases like flu.

Meanwhile, people vulnerable wear medical grade masks (N95) want to. (Medical grade masks protect wearer.). 

So, right now, I'm thinking (less vulnerable) need wear masks, even old people. may exceptions. instance, years flu vaccine matched actual circulating flu (hard predict) assume thing could happen covid. So, see wearing masks situations - exceptions.  Oh would treat, see brainwashed cartoons Won’t go? Good, shouldn’t allowed in.  That’s disagree article. think fear-based campaign showing realities unvaccinated hospitalization death financial ruin made highly visible hold outs.I don’t really care feel offended scared, want feel uncomfortable don’t choice, don’t. draw Trump looking like sexy plumber?  link work, try purposeful consumption silver, known antibiotic, preventative healthcare measure undertaken response fears Y2K problem would make antibiotics unavailable, event occur.

Yeah, want guy U.S. Senate. Medical insurance complex free testing free vaccines? Vegas trip set end October. booked things looking better, mask mandate anymore, CDC said rainbows sunshine.

But boom delta.

I'm fully vaxed plan wearing mask every oh man feel like I'm gonna get it. I've done everything right 18 months see everyone else living lives.

Not sure do. glasses fogging, wearing mask fits correctly. Fix general comfort likely improve well. go bike rides sunglasses fog even I'm wearing well-fitting mask, whereas they'd instantly fog poorly fitting masks. also probably better lungs even without pandemic live near city asthma, air pollution legit concern (especially exercising) n95s help without making hard breathe. symptoms bad enough warrant going hospital? Yeah im trying say there's cabal. people tend give power. Facebook industrial revolutionaries mean change lives much did. did... 
Not saying intention needed. ill keep eyes it. 

Thx let die. one cares point. many idiots like aren’t needed world   bet gets put vent going subscribe ""God works mysterious ways"" narrative That’s big unknown. also case various states recently well—less vaccinated NH though. NE vaccinated countries whose surge much worse. think lot people medical profession cut work medical profession variety reasons. make money, need care people. also need believe doing. believe end product, e.g. scientifically proven medical treatments like vaccines, job, opinion. 

I think disconnect field right now, get something like medicine ""job"" get like career, difference. school district close contacts quarantine.. got call school saying 10 year old close contact (they wont say contact is) wanted keep school could voluntary quarantine would go set number excuse absences.. 

We said well pull out.. next day 103 fever nasty cough starts. Took 4 days fever break another feel good enough get bed play some. daughter symptoms days later (from close contact sister). Wife also symptoms test.. J&amp;J never got even took antibody test last week negative natural.. Pzifer worked me!  Albert Bourla fully vaccinated. greatest risk factor Covid stupidity.   amazing part is

“When tested mice, vaccine patch generated antibody response 20 times higher traditional needle shot three weeks 50 times higher month.” Knowing ebola worked, seeing thing less ""showy"" killed made panic early on, humans love blow stuff ""seem bad"", lot stuff absolutely wrecking internal organs long term. ebola clear dying get isolated fast, die fast. true global end times virus kill slowly, blood gushing eyes days speed. Garrison: can't trust *those* people travelers go hospitals help surge get paid ridiculous amounts money (though well deserved). get guaranteed hours, situations reduce hours regular hospital staff hired travelers term case load dropped want pay part time employees. Sorry, comment incredibly civil respectful. seven continents, Australia smallest, 2,969,976 square miles, 7,692,202 square kilometers. However, considered island, largest world.

Sources say otherwise.  There's non zero chance gets it, guarantee he's vaxxed, prominent anti-vaxxer before.  know someone contemplating five year old use “treatment.” remember people aren’t harming conspiracies. Yep, 50.91% fully vaccinated 64.29% least one dose. Imagine saying 'muh liberte'

Whats wrong lol No, it’s mostly job making risk, plus asthma 50lbs many. 

Currently giving boosters people severe immunosuppressive issues.    Finally! antivaxxer real integrity! I'm sure opioid epidemic fairly large topic since prior drop.   cases mild even prior vax development

The vax changes ""most"" ""all"". Canadian, it’s highly regulated here.  makes science wonderful results repeatable. conclusion needs repeated control group, peer reviewed, held impartial standard. That's gives institutions like CDC FDA gravitas - gatekeepers determine things safe humans.

There science behind using horse medicine treat COVID. carnival barkers like Ben Garrison. shame reality check knock sense him. East Asians mask religiously public places, pandemic ever mutating common flu. Literally survival fittest. boyfriend's brother 40 CF. got double lung transplant four years ago thankfully well. now.

Before transplant, 5% lung capacity. pound fat muscle him. like 50 tubes going him, keeping alive. double lung transplant prolonged life. healthy appears right now, likely much time left.

Awful. haven’t chance ask question yet since boosters announced. think qualify teacher, originally Moderna shots. Pfizer approved booster, people Pfizer would allowed get it? group folks made poorest generations recent history, country health care dependent employment, still costs fucking arm leg.

most people know age 40, even see doctor regularly. ""family doctor"" since 16, I'm 35, now.   family members drink hydrogen peroxide. Colloidal silver too. uncle died heart attack skin grey. know causality, sure making healthy believed would.

They also believed Russia giant mirror space using heat oceans cause hurricanes.

Nothing surprises anymore people willing believe. Yes, stuck 2 years. Good thing I'm capitalist!  It’s pretty normal Tokyo subway trains, example. without pandemic. It’s something that’s common place outside east Asia. Great, people anomalous life-threatening pulmonary conditions compete morons healthy lungs. I'm sorry loss. :( Kidneys matched blood group what’s known human leukocyte antigens. less likely reject. Lungs transplanted within 6 hours typically matched blood group recipient. That’s lung recipients need take transplant meds rest lives. WV problem popping opiods ""pain management"" get vaccine     Seems terrifying live way I'm sorry loss. :( get prescription this? I’ve wanting continuous glucose test… Yup. Sister’s neighbor who’d transplant sort flew Oregon family event. hospital 6-weeks, currently incubated. 

Can imagine Aunt Betty dying cause big-ass wedding pandemic? Oh wait, Oregon. totally oblivious connection. second dose much worse third. didn’t get flu shot though. I’ll get couple weeks.   see. It’s long since statistics class. Anyone else see potential power creep?
 Like. 
The government controls guard military system. Right. government direct control entities working different areas locally. control businesses. Schools. Ect. work in.
 pay want.
 dont take non guard employees. 
And control directly 

""That's order solder...""
Just seems. Kinda like weakness laws allow this...   little glass vial.  doctors getting vaccine (and sma %) nut jobs. 

My fiance doctor, doctor hundreds knows vaccinated shithead religious nutjob. Pandemic over, brawl. Yes, does, it’s child officially going daycare. anxious mess. questions child daycare anyone word advice:

1) child 16 months attending daycare children city (Cheyenne) believe Covid. child gets Covid, would normal, vaccinated, healthy child cope virus? 

2) looking data city, bad Covid here? 

3) alleviate possible exposure alleviate likelihood severe covid? spanking.  Yeah, sounds awful lot like COVID me. results Covid-19 still dataset used produce average. saying post 1776 suppose Native Americans millions die Columbus Plague. Translation: dead next bout Covid. Nothing like making one's self broke (without unemployment comp) homeless responsible people. got booster Friday. first vaccinated feb/March. got sick chills, fever, aches, extreme exhaustion 24 hours second dose. expected booster. Instead achy around arm, tired 8-12 hours later. fever chills. felt well enough things next day. effects much less second shot. Cheryl ""you're supervisor"" Tunt energy. Well, blood, yes! Honestly choice really dead six months maybe dead ten years dozens meds really brutal side effects entire time lungs. vaccinated people also COVID before, likely similar rates, would cancel out. research earlier sperm count stays become less active. also take account meds might need take effect.

Oh yeh covid vaccine lol  Thank you. I'm glad better. I'm hoping hypothesis vaccination, along antibodies infection make super vaxxed. read back guy replacement heart really even beat, continuous flow, like screw drive. heartbeat. sure ever happened though. Hey, 87, shabby... Crap, I'm almost halfway there...

...woah-oh, livin prayer something Even masks perfect, eventually there'll day friends family want go restaurant bar dark, cold rainy/snowy out. can't eat drink mask on.

Why protect others even vaccine? Maybe that's way get action ;)

Next time change answer see end lol seems like multiple Jonestowns per day already Covid victims died dragged average two years. Shouldn’t average snap right back virus turns endemic? little glass vial? told WXIA: ""He wanted wait like 10 years so, kind like lot population wants longer.""

Now that's idiotic.  Oooh. I'm sorry. :( 

I hope recovery quick full. dont live normal life 1 lung. perplexing positivity rate criteria determining whether mask requirement. uncle heart transplant 3 years ago anti-rejection medications killed kidneys he’s dialysis Congrats! :D also got first flu shot last year, though help spread another illness could overwhelm hospitals even COVID-19 about. 

I'll also getting every year like spreading disease innocent people. SHIT Sherlock. 

This I'm getting flu shot October 1st. love vaccines! 3 them. 

But though risk hospitalization cancer patient 2021 2031? practical take drastic measures forever very, small % population likely _many serious risks seasonal illnesses_ risk pushed longer instead actually reduced.

Also boosters seem greatly helping population. say compassion someone lost friend Covid. I'm trying practical. qualify unemployment? honestly know NY. Las Vegas, know qualify diddly. going work? Private antivaccers clinics? wish come this. want people sick jobless. changes DNRA say /s Africa's health system little capacity test people, US least pretty significant ability test people. even hard figure Covid death toll many african countries even keep complete official records deaths, Covid otherwise. Also, US longer advanced far vaccination rate, even though started early we've surpassed dozens countries, even Cambodia significantly higher vax rate. Delta contagious still many people infect.  look malaria... even HIV

You're wrong, least today. COVID may get someday bur got sooooo far go.  Congrats, Spain! :D Outside specific cities masks non existent US. Given scandinavia UK largely mask free matter time (spring 2022 latest) Capitalism rules USA. agree free, even injection forehead. wish could get dad wear seatbelt :( us (me) live places go CDC recommendations Definitely huge era-encapsulating shot! good-Health care severely impacted. Imagine going ER emergency doctor treat turn hindsight covid minks actually *was* bad worried culled? ""being convinced"" fucking matter. numbers lie. Like swapping britta filter. piss  Sounds gross.. see them? Burning fast unvaccinated. US high rate people co morbidities high level vaccine hesitancy (deadly combination).

Regarding Africa -its probably biggest mystery pandemic. median age Africa 19.7 years must possible explanation. friends died waiting lung transplant Cystic Fibrosis. fool got even though made bad choices. Well company around 164 years, must know something mortality. WOW! That's amazing! :D   Holy snot, congratulations thank Brazilians! :D Look trying get argument you. Especially factual info, would stupid.

Please source info list it. Thanks. curious know too. want spend much time searching. topic anyway. Also page look mention increment basically countries. Er, falls leading cause death elderly. Good news? Either way, ill that’s good. I’m better back work. hubby still sick, nothing dangerous, lots congestion bloody noses. wish well. wore mask (in Florida!) followed restrictions. Arguably gone concert, guidance given government time, understandable.

There lot covidiots hate on, guy seem like one them. flu before, pneumonia never issues losing breath. Pneumonia made extremely weak, still breath. 

But March 2020 felt like cold, long move. moment moved - breath immediately. took month recover able simple exercises 2 month back normal. wife similar experience well. never got tested covid. know whether not, tell never ever experienced sickness felt like minor cold, severely affected lung capacity. Flu never anything like it. Well could say pretty much everything they've done whole pandemic.

I agree, doubt would different.  always run medical experts need help, precautionary advice. vast, vast majority kids young kids completely fine even contract covid. There’s always risk, always risk *literally everything*

If vaccine breastfeeding, studies show antibodies/immunity passed baby well. 100%, measurably. Yeah Idaho gave completely ago. majority population it’s 2019. Ah I'm guessing missed part (months ago) Trump asked team doctors disposal research injecting bleach lungs heard bleach kills covid. People weird, predictable. Tell em 2 months US order anymore vaccine anyone wants one needs get now. see lot finally flock it. Japanese wear masks reasons way they’re sick. It’s also pollution, hay fever, even fashion yes, Japanese wear masks even they’re sick. I’ve trouble communicating them, indication scarred life wearing masks everyday they’re public places. guessed number 600k last april 2020. thankfully higher year (at least officially), since passed number. new guess 2 million dead 2022. [this Congrats it!!! /s  scored 100. seems…unlikely. Idiots brainwashed Facebook posts Also, long term effects Long Covid might still affect life expectancy decades. Brazil best time relation pandemic since last year, still 7-day average 500 deaths right now, argue outside vaccination numbers, we're still great, gladly deaths going now. Brazilians pro-vaccination, Brazil also Free Universal Health System good infrastructure that's still able cover everyone here.  


Despite Bolsonaro many attempts discredit, downright refusal buy vaccine, still lot trust vaccines, we're still vaccinating lot Take “collapse” nonsense elsewhere.

Much country essentially back normal, places aren’t normal masks.

This whole time, people telling us things like hugs bars concerts never coming back. people underestimate much people like things. aren’t giving forever. mother told this. I'm loss words.

My aunt uncle took ivermectin Covid.

It's probably better *stop* listening guys. Weird, eh? 

You might want respond ""Not vaxxed, eh? concerned Night Trolls Candyman? go bathroom night!""

On one hand, might seem silly. sillier comment sperm? :)  mexican covid subreddit r/covidmx post yesterday asking think pandemic 2022 lot people predicting.

Most downvoted comments?

""Yes, vast majority vaccine previous infection immunity"", ""yes vaccines heavily reduce mortality""

lmfao mf'ers online want pandemic go forever, they're dreaming living locked everyone else locked well. There's telling. feel like honestly still know enough effects covid, even year later. got third dose. awful time second shot booster wasn’t nearly bad.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ultra conservative parents sharing kinds BS psuedoscience, misinformation, usually easily debunked. going VAERS rabbit hole trying explain VAERS implicitly states data cannot alone used determine safety effectiveness vaccine reports indicate reportee believed adverse effect caused related vaccine.

Today shared study appears peer reviewed journal toxicology conclusions assertions seems like would crumble scrutiny. Examples:

* actual total deaths due COVID19 America around 35,000
* number deaths due COVID19 reported VAERS actually reported factor 10!

Can anyone provide insight sources whether study legit peer reviewed already debunked. searching able find info rebuttals anywhere study sources. bad. previous post (without context) might make seem like saying saying *like* vaccines. main point. :)

I saying **if** rate infection goes **and** hospitalizations go up, masks come back. feel way masks come back people double vaccinated (ie people like me) infection rate hospitalization rate high.

I'm hoping 2022 (let's hope next year!) everyone gets vaxxed rates infection hospitalizations go down. gotta wait darwinism kick in. keep getting vaccines social distance, idiots start dropping hundreds. Little know brains play role survival fittest. Rubbish offensive subjective.

If refused listen medical experts, deserve medical experts save dumb asses. Blood goes in, piss comes out. can’t explain that, never miscommunication. Explain ""return normal life"" me, Albert. 

By ""normal"", we're talking, masks, go back packed bars indoor concerts long fully vaxxed, zero worry catching COVID and, hear out, even ""mild"", meaning feel like Mike Tyson pummeled us, feel way week two, that's ok ""mild"" definitely worry long term effects lungs brains organs, right?

That kind ""return normal"", right, Albert?

That's huge difference every time public indoors 365 days year. doctor writes one year, doctor Doesn’t care it’s drug. insurance doesn’t pay it. he’s hook. definitely thought would kind regional outbreak Asia would contained got us. 

Once exploding Italy South Korea, that's felt like inevitably going hit us hard.   guy eligible vaccination caught covid (March). can't speak Korea, Japanese usually wear masks sick, voluntary action. 

I'm talking mandatory mass making. Japanese wear masks every day school work. big difference ~2 weeks year sick every time indoors public indefinitely. Laughs European.  [He's fine.

Same ones said together pandemic. never sit mansion. study thrombocytopenia clotting/platelet issue seen AZ J&amp;J vaccines.

This entirely separate myocarditis heart issues seen mRNA vaccines. Unemployment, think, changes bit state state. qualify Unemployment state fired vaccinating. Seems like soon enough trick treat expect vaccines effective measure. Approved week, get appointment, get shot 1, wait weeks, get shot 2, wait couple weeks. talking early mid November assuming could get kid appointment immediately. 

Seems like aiming make Thanksgiving possibility.

Those us toddlers hoping Christmas miracle. like saying I'm going diet. easy get hungry. dude gets sick, head hospital. Winter 22 best chance controlling Covid sufficient community immunity prior infection transmission low. meantime one, two, three four vaccinations provided want protect inevitable infection. Well that's truly good thing European countries. governments sane enough drop pointless restrictions fall covid-zero trap Southeast Asia Australia. wear mask school Halloween masks OK? WTF.

America getting dumber hour. Freedum. Protection hospitalization, severe disease death. vaccines clinical efficacy. assumption made two doses makes safe getting others sick getting sick yes, time matters protection transmitting contracting covid wanes time. 

This actually unknown studies suggest opposite, vaccinated individuals, even immunity antibodies wanes, transmit anywhere near rates unvaccinated naive individuals. think good analogy would safety inspections car.

I don’t think analogy needed. you’re vaccinated you’ll mostly likely clear infection you’re contagious. It’s pretty simple doesn’t benefit analogy. makes feel better, deaths COVID-19 right COVID-19 truthers.

Proof natural selection real. Good. Good riddance choose selfish behavior human compassion. Since selfish acceptable societal behavior? Guess what...it never was. recently got argument (thankfully distant) relative thinks American Hospital Association evil controlling doctors nurses. logic reasoning behind think, regurgitate things read social media heard One America News.

Anything ask nurse? crazy thing NBA college basketball etc going keep going empty arenas. two Jazz players tested positive shut sports down.  Honestly, I'm surprised numbers higher. 

Outcomes pregnant women hospitalized COVID-19 good. mother getting enough oxygen, neither fetus. lot medications use treat serious COVID-19 safe use pregnancy, forces doctors families make terrible choices.

so 2.2M die (for reason, want vaccine). Also oily skin hell skin. wonder bad covid would happened 1918.

People appreciate medical advancements today enough.

Imagine bad would vaccine. want believe reading this? remember earlier pandemic Mexico reporting excess death figures, statisticians noticed death certificates numbered sequentially, able work many people died since pandemic began looking serial numbers, compared figures previous years calculate excess mortality. calculated spite government, result. Plenty governments trying conceal extent pandemic. 

These conspiracy theorist people idea world works. imagine telling story someone making figures proof must happened, they're ignoring evidence disproves hypothesis based absolutely nothing.   many epic lines song, like ""give us chance, 'coz fingers hands"" :D Ok.

There value concept, even applied subject meant taken literally literally would happen. old runner's joke every hour run live hour longer. 75-year old parents got third dose. tired day.

You want anecdotes though; random. Third-dose side effects similar second dose trials.  least hosts Fox encouraging it. Steve doocey regularly gets encouraging vaccination. 

I specifically say comment pointing 99% hospitalizations deaths among unvaccinated. received pushback choice gave genuinely human response, typical fox crap ""they want die."" may Delta. haven’t heard stats specifically countries.  even remember specific moments denial beginning! remember reading death whistleblower thinking bad virus citizens China, Canada would able isolate like SARS. also witnessed nurses worked cancelling conference plans March thinking over-reacting...

Hope feeling better! rates actually dropping, tho People like anything want believe. We’re fat.   vaccinated second time. 

I scared though bc second time got actually felt worse first time- much worse. terrified bc I’m daughter’s care taker. It'll good case study years now.  sure overweight counts?  2nd moderna @ May 1st. Got breakthrough covid Sept 2. Recovered 14 days, overall symptoms ""mild"", like bad flu symptoms. fine 10 days. Went light walk 3-4 miles afternoon yesterday. Now, 101 fever, headache, body aches. duck. life now? 30F

I autoimmune disease although mild.  I'm curious, where'd get numbers? Please post 6 month old articles. Interesting got covid roughly 4 months ago totally back normal 4 days later, also unvaccinated. 

Wonder stark difference is? know infinite amount monkeys smashing keyboards write perfect copy Hamlet...

As much like meaning behind this, simply true. infinite amount monkeys smashing keyboards necessarily write everything ever write. repeat gibberish ad-infinitum. Kinda seems like someone's trying get people accidentally kill lol Lies! COVID flu. Also, earth flat never landed moon. Fuck people refuse shots research. Let get sick die, that’s choice. painkiller one three got even less complain ;)  I'll wear seatbelt I've stopped driving. tide pod challenge may [not serious Mask mandates what’s keeping us living normally.

I’m masks, I’m security theater rules sake rules. forcing vaccinated people masks months years end way live. ""Paging doctors Cain Leopard white courtesy phone please."" [Context video know unvaccinated? ever ask get it? thing dominated headlines two years, really understand people decide take chances disease vaccine. Also U.S. women suffered biggest drop life expectancy women countries studied. get test? says cold?  recover say isn’t bad? 

Also I’m glad he’s going. Leave beds open people believe science. believe exactly want texas schools. want critical thinking fucking field day HCA gets one... Kareem NBA Commissioner! policy decision made cancel lot absolutely needed treatments (particularly around cancer) 'non essential' hospitals stood COVID. 

This stupid, evil decision lead numerous unnecessary deaths. 

Note happened covid vaccines available - need ensure malignant stupidity magnitude happen again, blame lack hospital care anti-vaxxers. fault politicians hospital admins. I'm happy hear it! Hopefully people actually *getting* damn things. Omg lol 🤣 money going nurses comes somewhere. insurance companies paying nurses more, companies going raise premiums. end costing consumers somewhere along line. fair first link study article work. thanks actual link! It’ll interesting post hermain cain sub It’s definitely improving! depend bit live prioritised get doses worst outbreaks happening, we’re definitely getting now. I've noticed people physically work pandemic also groups people lowest vaccination rates. Police, Fire, nurses, health care workers, nursing home workers, service workers, etc. lower vaccination rate.


There something said that. heavily exposed well year vaccine came out. constantly exposed something, eventually become used risk risk longer becomes perceived risk every day reality. mental block make justifications want think end day, perceived lack risk due constant exposure.


As people locked homes year, perceived risk huge justified. seen people year feel go outside world unvaccinated, get sick. see vaccine way re-enter world. apposed front line workers, outside world since day 1 without vaccine. vaccine change every day life. protects virus change day day.


With said, I'm trying dig psych people. think everyone vaccinated. past year rough people's mental well-being.


I also think lot resentment front line workers. physically went work people could work home, worked home people work got unemployment stimulus money. much offered front line workers terms hazard pay bonuses. 


Same testing. worked front lines year government offering weekly testing (if vaccinated). First responders weekly testing available soon test created. think he’s greatest, dad says doesn’t work hard enough defense. says lots times, doesn’t even run court. really try except playoffs. feel like cartoons often extremely mean spirited. 

That said, someone truly lives dies quietly home contracting COVID rather going hospital, kind respect stance consistency. goals sincere idea discuss medical aspect Covid devolve flame war politics forums talking easily can.  talking hospital administrator know telling nothing do.  watch hospitalizations. Part country good shape that. hope area gets control.

Hell, unvaccinated players allowed Toronto due carve due national special interest   lawyer talked said asked often lately type case almost chance succeeding.

Use sue-happy American legal system good. Assuming hiring lawyer damage finances much, sue anyway. Make sure gets press they'll happily start spewing articles ""Parent gets sued sending sick child school"" get clicks -- clickworthy pro-covid pro-vax folks.

Maybe publicity discourage people sending sick kids school. Simply Chinese shared research manufacturing information. really hope stick word.  Pfizer hasn’t submitted FDA yet, think three weeks starts end week, today. exact timeline immunity kicks may vary person person vaccine vaccine dosing schedule dosing schedule.

Two weeks final dose primary series long enough every vaccine avoids making ""am fully vaccinated"" test complicated. Nah, they're pretty close other. One gives likely joint pain, headache. think it'll kill little less paranoid. Well one less crazy ti worry about. kids vaccinated, keep called rest wont. Dumb, let thier fate. Time stop jobs going school. part TX, lots elevated ozone levels high amounts pollen quite now. Almost every single person know exhibiting symptoms ""could breakthrough mild Covid, could crap air"". there's easy way get tested here. Stores can't keep home tests stock, places locally get tested delays appointments extended result turnarounds. Primary care providers recommending vaccinated people treat like allergy air quality problems wear masks public. I'm sure fair percentage Covid. realistically, even mean local context? Community clinics, hospitals, urgent care centers, freestanding ERs high capacity. There's way get test results timely manner. People care vaccinated, wearing masks, taking precautions already. People care start caring lots people sniffles. bar much lower expect Personally whatever helps traffic dies. dies. Friday, boosters officially available lot demographics ""immunocompromised"". got two Pfizer shots 6 months ago BMI 25.1, technically eligible receive booster. got two Pfizer shots 6 months ago smoke, technically eligible receive booster. practice, anyone 18+ got two Pfizer shots 6 months ago get booster without provide documentation evidence eligible.  is, AFAIK Fox vaccine mandate.

Irony, innit? LOL made decision that. mandates laws placed covid. can't help want live life. Based what's CDC's website right now:

You fully vaccinated two weeks 2nd dose Pfizer, still considered fully know people must bad reaction mRNA vaccines died

There zero deaths attributed mRNA vaccines wear mask. Yeah. one you’re offered. might conservative Moderna simply protection severe disease waned much less Pfizer. 

Although looking one studies Moderna submitted... compared original trial experimental group trial group vaccinated unblinded Dec/Jan, months July August. calculate overall effectiveness lacked control group, groups significant number cases, later vaccinated group still number cases, substantially better earlier group. So, know Moderna waning, booster ups protection, informally, 7-8 months , would seem justify it, year definitely would.

If want avert major issues instead wait manifest react, they've got evidence, choose use it.  vaccine ...no hospital  Good. Die home. Best part Airplane! bold strategy cotton…

Ebola much aggressive terms symptoms prognosis. even small amount precaution goes long way combating it. trick virus spread much possible, requires perfect storm virulence harm. virulent enough, spread. harmful, chance spread. Balance them, boom. spreads like wildfire. Nearly every post report somebody ""getting booster"". many immunocompromised people posting reddit? Genially confused.  public also acts like it’s rare nurses don’t love work. can’t think 5-10 people I’ve worked nurse actually like it. pays well, work 3 days week hospital setting want, it’s always demand. That’s people job. 

Most know would say hate even liking  Good him. totally agree said workplace. Plus, fired unvaccinated, average intelligence workplace would increase. fully support movement. wish could enforce even, deny vaccine deny medicine stay fuck away hospitals.  days, that's all. Perhaps something else going you? persists, get checked out. say end may accurate people chronic disease. Yeah, drug thing too.

I've tried harder drugs like, times (literally few) life, many, many years ago. never heroin anything like that.

And still knocked 9 years off. caught virus vaccine became available, chose get it; went large concert. believes that's caught covid.

Oh well....  could US reporting well. Exactly. friend mine ended two double transplants 24 29 still died mid thirties. feel ""recreational drug"" thing bit harsh. gradiations.

I clicked yes, I've tried drugs occasionally (molly, xanax, adderall), exactly common thing - last time xanax like 5 years ago, like, one pill every couple months, molly once. calculator knocked 9 years lifespan.  Dustin Hofmanns movie *Little Big Man* featured 'contrarian' native American; washed dirt, dried water, rode horse facing Good. I'll take booster, thanks.  incredibly fucked unlucky would caught COVID again. \*knock wood\* God forbid. Wish best hope lives long-- that's crazy operation. 50% lung transplant patients alive 5 years, mostly rejection. It’s rough. Hearts would easiest believe, blood pump.
All organs lot organic micro biology going see machines able reproduce came 94. would indicate I’ll die younger three four great-grandparents. (or all) pills likely anti-rejection meds make immuno-compromised. He's going need extra vigilant around people now.  Covid pandemic caused biggest decrease life expectancy western Europe since second world war, according study. 
Data 29 countries – spanning Europe, US Chile – analysed scientists recorded reductions life expectancy last year scale wiped years progress. 
The biggest declines life expectancy among males US, decline 2.2 years relative 2019 levels, followed Lithuanian males (1.7 years).

Avoiding vaccine, 'Covid really big deal' level thinking 'the Earth, created 7 days, still flat' Different different organs Id imagine. probably take better transplants other. Double lung bit kidney already live one we're born two. know wife shit crazy complex. aint like changing lightbulb pop old new.  kind idiocy making want revoke organ donor status. would truly hate stupid person get body parts bothered right thing. Jeez. beg cash people actually donate almost $50k, unreal. could think... h2o2 gets blood things... could possibly anything damage inside live organs?!  really sad much civilization virus messed up. Thanks.
 Paraphrasing another quote reddit makes morbid sense zombie movies right people. makes feel fustrated sad. must jaded. grandfather got kidney transplant lived another 34 years. Died year something kidney related.  kids dont wear masks home, see people. thing makes someone autistic. Offensive. Get life.  Thank much! I'm feeling right haha!

Completely agree walking, free anywhere! People unhealthy, less American population vaccinated, delta far infectious seems give bigger viral dose Read nursing sub. bunch walking around medical advice papers now. morons threaten leave, whip paper go let know it’s signed. Several pieces once:

First, mutations. Mutations happen *constantly* viruses. Mutations make fatal also means less opportunity spread kills host quicker. usually *decreases* fatality rate long run.

More contagious, however, means people infected, usually overwhelms medical facilities. technical term is, ""triage,"" deciding people get resources people don't. pandemics epidemics, triage kills people, infected. people heart attacks, strokes, asthma, everything else usually treatable available staff resources.

Second, selective pressure. public usually hears selective pressure breath Survival Fittest, Evolution, and/or Darwin. Modern examples antibiotic-resistant superbugs, like Pressure means bugs survive antibiotics likes get keep living reproduce. body finish killing off, infection spread others. COVID bacteria, process applies, applies pressures. pressures include everything well survives outside body hot/cold, dry/humid, etc environments. includes hosts thrives hosts starves in.

Which brings us third point - hosts. early waves Pandemics Epidemics always hit hardest. fact, early waves usually pretty weak exploit novel-ness. wind killing susceptible hosts first. initial waves contained, subsequent waves able survive healthier hosts selective pressures, infectious vectors typically robust harder kill.

So a, ""well-trained,"" virus spreading supply healthy hosts vast majority people remaining fit category of, ""healthy hosts.""

And still pandemic/epidemic strength half-stepped every step way.


And data seeing akin percentage. want increase percentage, decrease bottom number and/or increase top number. decreased bottom number (total available hosts) weak, immuno-compromised, unhealthy (""pre-existing conditions"") died. we're increasing top (number infections) selective pressure half-stepped measures allowed continue spread healthy hosts (who, oddly enough, go figure, *are* fact susceptible).

So real question is, ""How badly screw every single step managing COVID, including expectations media portrayal, surprising result?"" feels good someone gets wishes fulfilled. X-ray something else? went lot longer February. lie. lived bubble. job pretty much pack kids bubble teach them. 

I hate covid. hate people take serious. 

There fun video Jordan Kepler anti mask rally North Carolina cheered bit. Good lol, literally 10s thousands Filipino Nurses/ Medical Assistance gladly fill spots work harder. 

My fiance doctor favorite Nurses Filipino men women. boat you. me, less side effects 2nd dose. bit sore little tired wasn’t bad all. 12/10 would again. postponed year now. Uncomfortable, indeed. 8%? holy fucking shit got booster, symptoms 3 shots. It’s useful skill people menstruate ? home games okay travel spread around? antivaxxer? rest lives? said fine masking they're vaccinated. wearing rest lives insane. workers went six months community college certificate. getting UI benefits either. Stupid stupid does. That's awesome mate, good making change! young enough make big difference. 

Walking real pleasure too, try year round. Nothing like fresh air seeing outdoors. Start cocaine drinking clear answer here. Yep thing last January well, honest actually believed go past March. Boy wrong. defense thought January, time got February pretty much knew going case.p mean yeah covid becomes like flu background disease doesn’t slam hospitals seasonally see things going back normal. needs mutate worse based social distancing Brazil (spoiler: not), would bet money Delta fooling around awhile causing serious issues. boom 47 years left! aw shit. far, CDC Fluview shows flu US year 1/10 normal year. little international travel, people masking, people working home, people self isolating sick, looks like going lighter usual flu year.  


(I've gotten flu shot every year, except last year I'm going skip year, unless flu starts take off, far, looks like need. Would still recommend elderly risk.)  God Save Dr. Joseph Drop, a.k.a. Joe Little Drop. people go doctor routine exams, 

Because damn expensive still health insurances cover routine exams. pay damn much money every month insurance can't afford actually use. need artificial organs already better real. 2021. Scientists need figure already!  Viking instincts coming out.

So start shaving, manicuring hairstyling impress English women? R P J E Likely. doctor wife brutally disabused notion get transplant good new. dont last forever, they're never good always risk organ rejection even much later. Shits rough. Amazing medical stuff nothing close like getting good new. get this. Never will. 

I remember went college nursing major program them. remember taking biology class professor asked class nursing major class graduate. graduate people. said got lucky. one nursing student class would totally different need make sure know stuff. 

And told nurse vaccinated said worried sperm? like no. misinformation deep real scary. 2 nurses ask worried sperm vaccinated.  insane.   anything National Guard can't do?

Go un-vaccinated  also culture *loving* free stuff. I've done research water wet opportunity gone claimed hoax. Unless kills 1/3rd Europe like black plague, close yeah, BS

&amp;#x200B;

a lot stuff correlation real science Exactly fiance born Brazil, ancestry goes back Italy Germany (before WWI WWII). see issue reason eternal masking evading vaccines. I've worn mask religiously I'm tired it. really harder breathe through. can't exercise mask (gets covered sweat, hard breathe). like going grocery store, eating samples. glasses fog mask.

I care others. I'll keep wearing mask vaccines available everyone (including &lt; 5), that, really want things back normal.  even though get high 90's missing lot stuff important  COVID rates insanely high United States many people vaccinated US? COVID rates Africa example extremely low compared United States, yet vaccination Africa vastly lower.   person. heard January dismissed it. said hit here.  used things Asia. squash it. 

And second part thing. 

It still blows mind conference 1,000 people 3 days everything shut down. People NYC, NJ, Ct, Pa, shaking hands. didn't. few. spoke father month later amazed. Wait, actually? Ok bring sunshine body? /s people care federal government never intended much power. again, probably haven’t witnessed vaccine-induced strokes. FDA admitted to. others, got around 80 years old. COVID really made evaluate myself. turn 32 end year. 300 lbs start COVID 225 lbs walking 5 miles every day complete diet change (with 1-2 cheats week). 

Now mom died 51 dad 60 cancer smokers dad least 3 beers day. I'm head curve.

But yeah, COVID caused change things. I'm grateful too, I'm lucky gotten it, can't imagine would like beginning pandemic gotten it. Aren’t basically waiting FDA? makes think North America won’t approve vaccine 5-12 year olds. mean, asked question answered.  raise generation children borderline autistic can't read faces understand nonverbal communication.

Is everyone masked time anywhere right even family members house? No. use masks public transportation crowded places. That's it. 2 year olds cohort 5-11. earliest (2-4 years) November. latest, assuming Pfizer sticks proposed schedule, would December. youngest group, 6 months - 2 years, probably next year. Kids autism known understanding nuance facial expression nonverbal communication. know correct verbage, sorry.

Kids grow masks every second house deficient skills, much like kids autism. Uh, claim artificial sweeteners cause harm also correlative well lol. think experimental data for

FDA says less sugar better cause lots sugar causes bad things. Sparingly consuming sugar anything you.

I think meant say ""there evidence consuming artificial sweetener bad you"". Obviously consuming sparingly would fine...

What added Vs refined sugar point? I'm basically saying I'm gonna drink Coke, I'd rather drink classic Coke Diet Coke. reasons experts give choose diet Coke classic Coke calorie sugar reasons, good enough reasons high sugar calorie intake first place. Well, they’re Oregon live! attest that. Oh yeah continue listening government Giving candy kids free?! …but European history. want huff Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor go it..

If want take medication somebody Facebook says worked go it.

You free whatever like matter incredibly fucking dumb is.

If somebody stupid enough mind numbingly dumb shit let them, world would much better place let mindless idiots shove whatever random substance throats flavour day social media.  US life expectancy dropping covid.  funerals. ""Line Duty"" deaths basically means family gets would benefits paycheck next 20ish years. We're getting scammed. HCQ, Bleach, horse paste bad enough? update #2 -- wow, okay, thought symptoms waning 24h, they've come new ways 30 hours since injection. significant chills, mild nausea, mild diarrhea, extreme fatigue, foggyness. Maybe yesterday flu shot side effects today covid vaccine? anyway, preferable COVID, worth it, happy boost protection symptomatic infection given occupational risk factors, ouch. turning last longer effects shot #2 (though think ever gotten quite intense like shot #2 did). collateral damage counted COVID?

I'm talking people denied care unvaxxed psychopath taking ICU bed.

Lives lost due lack care. Lives shortened could prolonged cured. Lives crippled disease treatable.

I promise way think. Per capita Spanish flu 3X deadly.

Comparisons absolute numbers make sense 1920 US less 100 million people.  Congratulations, we've Made America Great They're claiming ""Line Duty"" taxpayers like us hook 20+ years paying death benefits families sum seven figures per cop. 

Absolutely outrageous electeds going along madness. Wow antivaxxer yet found another dumbass pseudo-science bullshit kill themselves.

Guess nature, err, finds way... thin herd  It’s horrific death toll exceeded prediction [this Washington Post used bouncing balls show exposure works?

Edit: ah realized already clarified article. dec 2019 family incredibly sick bad cold. 6 yo daughter told us classmate recently visited Japan came back. Barely whispers news covid Jan 2020. sick reading could knew didn’t cold.

By February glued Reddit watching Italy Spain succumb covid, American shelves became barren toilet paper sanitation. March administrations silence issue, already losing sleep come. even worst fears don’t compare we’ve gotten.

I’ve zero medical background even someone like trusting science much, wasn’t anything could magically wake others tidal wave disease coming.

My MIL special Ed teacher, last summer argued would gone last July everything would normal 2020/2021 school year. told prepare online teach retirement 2 years later. Guess right makes difference overall effect pandemic within society... whether virus killing young men world war, mostly babies, mostly women, mostly Asians, mostly seniors, mostly fat people, whoever, longterm effects differ.  

That's fact always factor pandemic compared others. like point places due local culture people took effective precautions regardless whatever half assed directives government issuing.

I saw data bay area 2020 showed public moving rapidly counter covid 2-3 weeks government health departments anything. Gilead, come. think take issue fact hypothetical COVID passport US would issued fully vaccinated. 

In Denmark, issued one vaccinated, previously infected negative test (valid 3 days). reason, many Americans don’t see previous infection good enough. seem like could decent basis lawsuits people undermining mitigation efforts Texas Allowing facts dash zealous beliefs makes feel strong. They're copying confident role models (Alex Jones etc) time uncertainty, trying also appear strong peers. They're playing social game facts bear relevance to. dumb article. people already decided won’t take it. nice isn’t going change fact.  Actually please inform cops, really, exceedingly important shot free. man (and victims) goes home tells buddies shot cost $77, might think, ""nah want spend kind money, i'll take chances covid"". remain unvaccinated.

That scammer endangering community bucks. Please report soon can.    Interesting…

The first study posted actually thrombocytopenia (which associated “rare clotting side-effect” adenoviral vaccines), one myocarditis (the “rare heart complication” mRNA vaccines). Interesting accidental intravenous injection could behind both. Wait…two smallest states names Vermont Wyoming??? Wyoming HUGE, population probably lowest (wouldn’t doubt that) wording awful here.

I'll say more: exactly reason made/makes angry people bang kids likely die covid. That, kids still die parent wants risk that/go that?! :(  also get fact nursing programs super competitive. school, major BSN school area let's 100 candidates per year... Lots really smart people passed barely accepted nursing school.

It may sound counter intuitive expand nursing schools people lower scores, difference students student single B, think argument made smart students turned down.  article mentioned nothing Pfizer best short term. equally effective seemed first, even comparing factors like antibody levels weeks second dose, Moderna seems edge. wish hadn't, super unpleasant vast majority states cannot. fired refusal take vaccine considered firing cause makes someone ineligible UI.

However, states passing new laws specifically allow vaccine refusers collect unemployment. believe Wisconsin first state so, states currently process passing legislation. Agreed, maybe Onion someone fake ones? Aspirational? Olympics even fans present? mean earth would believe fit bot vaccine needles, tech.

Those fucking pills though. big enough. course bots them. So...basically...no different ivermectin Idiots already think Ivermectin Pfizer patenting mean children get hospitalized -- that's metric. pretty significant fraction children still get long term months long symptoms. think much we've taken children's lives -- closed schools immediately March 2020 order stop spread rest society. School closing considered another tool pandemic strategy.

Kids sacrificed ton rest society. vaccine dose 1/3 adult -- we're cusp approval want rethink vaccinating all, take away best chance strange long term effects disease.

Um, exactly. little bit probably hurt (other building turning blue-gray) lot could could cause complications depending rare cases, high doses colloidal silver cause serious side effects, seizures organ damage.
Colloidal silver may also interact prescription medicines, including penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen), quinolone antibiotics, tetracycline levothyroxine (Unithroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid).

Immunity third shot appears least good original claims second shot (i.e. ~95%). Exactly much worry infection depends detail situation medical history. Talk Also, long take booster takes effect? Two weeks?

I can't find third-shot-specific answer question [this says two weeks rule-of-thumb applies Regardless vaccine get, won’t reach full protection two weeks second final dose. That’s long takes immune system mount antibody response vaccines work way. Think terms cold—it takes body good amount time rid what’s making sick. vaccine essentially faking immune system triggering similar response. shot, body work do. Wdym? Ontario well COVID Rn Ye we've known awhile, vitamin D3 deficiency least, makes respiratory illnesses slightly severe long mind-numbingly dumb, unproven, falsified, incorrect, obviously peer-reviewed, plague enthusiasts latch onto anything try make feel like they're ones 'right' information!  


Anything truth guys. :( see line? I've read 3 articles find mention that. total win. They're still running around public spreading disease. Yeah seems like conditioned think wackos reside America. ruling, issued Friday, Ludwig wrote: “Defendants may preferred keep Marquette county residents ignorant possibility Covid-19 community longer, could avoid field calls concerned citizens, preference give authority hunt eradicate inconvenient Instagram posts.”  partially pay insurance premiums based actual costs involved insurance company testing 2,000 per employee per year (high estimate) save million dollar ICU bill come ahead group size 500 (which forget includes families, testing employees impacting savings likely twice three times many premiums).

so redi clinic billed insurance assuming every employer choose send employees redi clinic type places rather free alternatives work deal clinic come work site discount use myriad mail options self testing order bulk antigen tests. sustainability impacted choices addition counterbalance cost savings get prevention medical costs within claim pools work determined cost us $5k per week order test unvaccinated employees. big company. I'd imagine company happy paying $60k year employees afraid needle. ""**Experts** warn""

Did really need experts tell us monoclonal antibody treatment. able try that?  Yes data. 5 1000. idea people get hospital treatment. facts have. agree set covid pumping vit &amp; zinc less helpful doctors still recommending people take sick. So, doctors recommend it, must lower risk. 

These facts deal even though fit feelings. Ah Africa young population, leave them. apply logic American children? ""it's like us wearing two life jackets, others drown.""

I think better analogy flight tell put mask helping others. pandemic US still control, notice. « His body, choice. » Funny works ppl actually get covid. can’t go hospital. county won’t accept unvaccinated covid patients hospitals full operate triage rules. least he’s looking trip immediate area wants medical treatment. think many UK begin I’m glad got vaccinated end February. 3 kids gotten sick since I’m 100% sure vaccine protected cared kids. Now, protection might waning kept safe needed it. look forward booster. ""Why'd tell piss electric fence? *know* I'm dumbshit listen!"" Sure, rainy day out-of-service bus election day also make difference election. point going hundreds competing effects upcoming elections push results slightly one way another - Covid deaths thought much another drop bucket. 

I also emphasize 0.25%-0.3% number *very* generous, assuming literally everyone died one particular affiliation. would hard time believing actual number 0.1%. D3 required proper immune system function general, least understanding. COVID specific. already D3 deficient, taking improve odds. deficient worsten immune system therefore make harder fight virus. called ""horse paste"" appropriate ""so called 'vaccines'"".

Reinfection rare, vaccines perfect, come risks natural immunity comes with. Sure, natural immunity great, *getting* natural immunity sucks. Ask Ted Nugget, Herman Cain, etc.
 
Is measles vaccine ""leaky""? Mumps? Flu HPV?  Well sounds like problem take care itself.   New Irish vaccine stats out!

 18+ year olds fully vaccinated.  
 16+ year olds fully vaccinated. 
 12+ year olds least one dose vaccine.  Sure, vaccines treatments. would loved one many treatments like I've read recent breakthrough case, example. seen studies definitively proving efficacy vitamin zinc. definitely seen studies show reduced fatality taking supplements on-set symptoms. he's taking things necessarily mean risk lowered. confusing correlation causation.

Your link assumes 5/1000 die general population age. take account lack medical treatment hospital refusal. refuses treatment, odds much greater 5/1000. also severe symptoms 2+ weeks lost 15 lbs. would imagine fatality segment much much higher 5/1000. Unfortunately easily accessed data specific condition. know supposed results kids young 2 “shortly after” results 5-11 group. say results 6 month-2 year group October November. I’m guessing means results 2-5 group also October. 

If EUA timeline vaccines/age cohorts, get approval 3 weeks later. hope case.  ask question know answer to? Africa two advantages going it, helped keep Covid deaths down:

* youngest population, far, continents. Given extreme age-dependence Covid severity, helped keep severe infections downs also helped keep transmissions somewhat.
* Africa large proportion rural population (especially compared industrialized/developed countries) population especially mobile. transmission far muted compared rapid spread seen connected populations. think I'm saying anything contrary saying, understand would need edit comment account me.

In case, here's article read months back Pfizer requesting EUA ""September"": I'm talking about.  Every attempt I've made thus far point actions affect people around us completely whooshes heads, met derision, often followed ridiculous comparisons obesity, non-Covid heart disease, AIDS ... in, need passports them, too. maybe deny treatment, well. (Ummm ... none conditions airborne, clog hospitals once.)

Mention little kids families? LOL-fest! *my* problem. Plus, kids can't catch spread Covid. (They can, course, Delta makes worse).

Immunocompromised? Sucks them. need stay home. Forever. Ta-ta! (Like that's fair, even doable.)

Oh, misinformation campaign massive fairly popular. I'm afraid discourse subject irreparably broken. issue clinics locally doctor specifically. Switching primary care doctors viable solution able get care urgent issue like UTI. already patient large family medicine clinic. None doctors practice could squeeze either Friday. 3 urgent cares connected family/general medicine clinics 4th urgent care tried connected pediatric clinic. None could see either.  victim disinformation. People trusted lied purpose killed him.

It's well good disappointed people able see sort thing, techniques, tribalism, distrust authority, echo chambers, exist works.  ""religious exemption"" latest pig-brained crap people come antagonize rest us. disagree? That's schools kept open throughout pandemic like many countries did. really bad child teen loses parent.

Exactly get sooner kids get vaccinated sooner case rates go nothing.

Well still tonnes unvaccinated adults, no. never go nothing. surge every year. bad name NZ?

Question: transfer request anti-vaxx state/municipality, *and* person requesting transferred unvaccinated, guys (officially unofficially) make low priority, deny transfer--or least weighs negative request?

Personally, I'm hoping answer yes.  Feels great Ben Garrison.   finally bi-monthly brunch! good them. US here. anything preventing uncle late 50s comorbidities walking CVS requesting booster?

Edit : hes 60 years old rely thoughts prayers, ivermectin, vitamins beet juice.

Modern medecine cannot help unwilling.     haven’t asked someone bumped I’ve told several times different people specific family member really sick small kids thing supposed make important rest hospital full really sick people also families people need them. think least favorite thing tell “what understand they’re really sick”.

Pending time, I'd tell something like ""Oh they're really sick/have kids/etc? Well sure, put head list, people list ahead little bit sick/have kids/etc - WAIT COURSE IDIOT""

I mean, nurses/RT/doctors/etc like gold right now, like really afford fire you..

Or maybe something like ""What's COVID-19 vaccination status? accept people proof vaccinations.""

I got that. understand they’re really sick think better basically 0% survival point we’ve told several times that’s something don’t seem understand keep telling god plan them, agree plan die, won’t consider withdrawing care. don’t put corpses ECMO, take it

I really feel bad folks. un-ending stupidity... could take it. I'd fucking snap.  difference close elections. 2 states 2020 POTUS election decided 0.25-0.3% spread example. 2017, control Virginia state house decided coin flip decisive district otherwise-split house ended tie. None sarcastic. it. Good. keeps bed free someone responsible enough get vaccine. applaud soon-to-be corpse sacrifice. Good riddance.  conversations folks imagine developed within last 12 18 months,” said. “But reality, soon discovered nucleic acids role biology, people began thinking ways using nucleic acids idea using RNA vaccine something that's around 20 30 years.”

Say louder resisters back. scientists relevant fields knew needed ready fight new viruses. None comes blue. people would wear masks get vaccinated, hospitals capacity. are. Can't flunk freshman high school course never make high school. Disney actually exact place want go…but parks. Literally want go runDisney races  Got jj got breakthrough starting Monday 20. I'm two days row symptom free, sense smell back feel like energy wise. really rough first leveled quick. oldest (vaccinated) pretty much too, two younger unprotected kids not. Day 8 low grade fever them. can't wait approve shot younger kids. Ah yes, proper way applying statistics. would argue Covid impact life expectancy anyone living right now.

You survive live average life span. die it, case pull mathematical average us. real answer idea many cases been. best way view official case deaths counts floor model trying estimate things. 

Basically team trying estimate total number Covid infections TX come formula makes assumptions variables change around try dial result. Well plug data come estimated 3.5 million cases far know something wrong formula inputs since confirmed case count.  It’s bit like Germany 1500’s, even so. one united different histories, religion etc. probably get better claim ivectimin, rather statistically people get better getting Covid. Nothing like sick making shit intestinal lining.  [That’s needs tho.](r/therightcantmeme)  He's dug hole, he'll buried it.

Fuck idiot. They're minority, they're *really goddamn loud* minority. really seeing weeding gene pool? I’m objecting anything, I’m saying… went Florida last year ( Disney ). pretty much followed precautions could felt fairly secure. used masks, practiced hygiene, basically restricted Disney properties ... time practicing strict measures guest safety.

I go rave there, use precautions think could take trip safely. vaccinated, might want add additional day end trip short quarantine rapid test sure bringing anything back friends family. hundreds thousands others serious side effects.

All vaccine victims taking ICU beds right now. It’s outrageous people choose unvaccinated depriving people deserve access machines.  fair, everything labeled Garrison cartoon, never able tell hell trying convey.

And given fact he's spouted every possible falsehood virus treatment, I'm sure we'll get ""tragic"" update next week It’s sad people manipulated extreme sign hospital gravely sick. fair. wasn’t goi something else. He’s better place now
🤷🏻‍♂️ get test. friend though. Even non extremists often go testing government starts calling etc. kinda annoying. [cum (NSFW - language, lol) favorite. Future HCA recipient Doesn’t care—grabs popcorn. know crazy be

Have ever looked couple cartoons? Dude mayor crazytown. shifting age demographs due covid could even make 2022 slightly higher 2019 wave magic wand make covid long-covid disappear. Maybe fewer suicides less air pollution thanks things like people able WFH, etc could also contribute that.

But even reached zero covid end year, long-term effects covid likely still continue kill years. it’s funny helpful. obviously low-effort response.  never made claim fixed, specific.

You claimed likely survive without hospital intervention. sounds like assuming least 50% case fatality rate unhospitalized, correct? Since appear saying Less likely survive not? That's ol' ben nutshell. fans, guess. *just* read.  longer try stay hospital less survival rate probably. Also he's increasing chance long term complications.  describe sounds like pretty damaging consequence: COVID breeds generation jaded physicians, we'll still issues road (I can't blame running low empathy, exhausted anti-vaxxers well) 

On hand, nurses worried about. going see workforce continue strain probably bleed good nurses next year, even thing gets better  though? looks like knock-off Ben Garrison comic. Ben Garrison ain't great artist looks amateur produces.  vaccinated get healthcare? applied janitor hospital, turned afraid needles get vaccines wanted, years covid. Man totally thought cartoons making FUN republicans longest time Willing bet money actually COVID another grift claim later getting whatever (if anything) beat without vaccine hospitalization.

But hey I'd happy find I'm wrong here. US already first world imo   vaccines certainly help.

&amp;#x200B;

Right?

&amp;#x200B;

Right? No. It’s true. It’s impossible!  Everybody plan get punched face.

Hypoxia often cause sense impending doom. Nobody ignores impending doom. bright side, keep beds open patients. 

I don’t wish anyone death sickness (especially it’s painful) it’s getting hard sympathy people. going go full circle injecting bleach aren’t we?    Mortality fixed 1% like seem think is.    guy famous(ish)? There's lots shitty cartoonists world... could also huffing paint seems preference silver gold. Death Watch initiated.   also think worth noting strong individualistic culture helps provide groundwork anti vaccine division. culture puts individuals first, really collectivism pull us together. attack country much lower death toll (still horrifically tragic course) pull us together pandemic ever did, despite much higher death toll. Countries community oriented us better well, even they've resources, citizens adhered public health measures better.  Please post data mortality rate 64 year old man diagnosed Covid following conditions: lost 15 lbs, several weeks, taking ivermectin zinc refusing hospital care.  exist, guarantee lot higher average person.

RIP seems figured 👏👏  ineligible see hesitancy anything it. Something fishy there. Deadliest disease, period. Paranoia. Since person unvaccinated likely fallen conspiracy theory. Give another conspiracy hospital, coerce leaving. Hospitals cannot hold people wills. patient demands discharged relieve hospital liability leave. 

Also, here's something else hospitals/doctors/nurses deal with. person leaves bad review online, makes claims hospital/doctor cannot refute HIPAA even true. Heck Hydrogen Peroxide used rocket fuel. according kff, roughly 74 million doses, im sure take account spoilage. would really good. become convinced cry ""freedom"" really mean ""freedom consequences"".

They want X, zero tradeoff.  Pfizer booster got approved many people. might fall categories. fda cdc haven’t approved mixing brands. grapefruits? don’t give shit posts. Fuck anti-vaxxers awful. bad enough antivaxxers spreading misinformation keeping people getting vaccinated. Now, convincing gravely ill leaving hospital. friend thirty. Healthy. got covid feb right teachers allowed vaccines. got lucky. got pneumonia. walk across living room without using inhaler. eventually recovered. go hospital lung scans, recovered. 

Yesterday texted hospital. Blood clot lungs pneumonia again. said, I'm fairly positive covid effect. healthy thirty year old gets blood clots? bit overweight, anxiety meds. Otherwise though? 

And knows last time it'll happen, it'll happen life. Yeah, anti-vaxxers everyone's problem, that's they're infuriating.

My job involves data non-medical field. thing always say is, data statistics persuade people. Stories do.

If friends, family, coworkers anti-vaxx, show stories unvaccinated people died covid. There's entire subreddit devoted these. Make feel foolish terrified, whatever takes get get shots. two doses Phizer wish travel Thailand 47% vaccination rate. get another dose one?  That's tragic.  started telling people wear mask regardless vaccination status, instantly thought they’re never going go away. Still, merrier! know what? point, it.  exactly asked [this shows rate hospitalisation age group among fully vaccinated vaccinated. Many people don’t money routine exams preventative health. Many people can’t afford feed family healthy food. least you! one. wrong dude? First flat earth this?

Somebody needs block YouTube like child. Apparently got sick eligible vaccination. think take long time. guidance based transmission levels local area isn’t lot pressure change it. transmission falls, masks come (if following guidance). transmission stays low say, “why change guidance, don’t wear masks based anyway.”

The bigger challenge probably state local health departments/politicians make decisions tougher CDC guidance. think rules scaled back eventually may take time tend quite risk averse. Actually, new evidence makes natural origin likely source: dude KKK. Seriously, Google Zê Gotinha see. fair, host dies covid Show me? include those!   Sounds right.  Well, maybe conspiracy folks correct, because, know, die returned hospital.

1) COVID symptoms don’t show 24 hours after
2) Dr. perform COVID test? “professional opinion” cause don’t believe modern science?

Thats whats happening friend mines mom. anti-vaxx, hospital almost 4 weeks now? got slightly better, got blood clot brain, undergo surgery, went well, lungs severe damage well again. right front everyone yet dont want get spite Government 😑 stops 2013, u clearly see starts going last 1/2 years  Took another quick glance Seems pointing increment basically countries. Take look yourself, quote source info prove contrary.

Here graph UK example:  plenty studies found many 1918 deaths would prevented modern medicine. Nothing controversial comment. plenty studies found many 1918 deaths would prevented modern medicine. Nothing controversial comment. Delta spreads faster. Younger people buying anti vax propaganda more. Younger people can't afford sit around like retired people. likely effects Delta better spreader.

Could underlying genetic coagulopathy, birth control smoking contributing case well.

I wish friend well, getting anticoagulation ezpz casual thing Republicans say he's lying Yes came back within week I'm sure asking question gets downvotes.

Because information long time now, question common form used covid deniers, sounded like covid denier.

You're right though fair question - people sick educating others bothered educate yet. what's main reason nurses, etc wanna get vaccinated? nursing school demanding used be? Public Health 101 even pre-requisite anymore? Baffled honestly...  wait there's more! America health insurance tied employment article says nothing 10 years, bit unsure vaccine matter eligible anyways.

It say got it.  Necessity mother invention, number people needing lung/heart/kidney transplants due COVID19 long-term effects near future, possibility.... posted here, let’s get open air Jeeps dart guns tranquilizers COVID serum. Let’s ride like we’re safari! 

Of course, NRA stay silent knock anti-vaxxers pro-gunners confused support. can't nice things. Sheesh. Delta much worse Alpha even funny. We're working it.

Bans things like stem cell research significantly slowing it. vaccination sperm?  Even stevens anything, Bolsonaro made people want _more_ vaccine absolute stupidity. Yes, paying 35 euros gym can't even go test 2 times every week, since last week can't even take bus without negative test. Vaccinated people transfer covid too, need tested, why? checked see unvaccinated, IMO, voluntarily unvaxxed get transplant.

In situation, indeed unvaxxed - eligible vaccine time, gets pass there.

He also wore mask. thing fault attending concert, that's fair enough - followed restrictions time got unlucky.

I wish they'd actually put pictures could see damaged lungs looked like. 6 months someone's second dose, what? Omg! felt comment soul! telling husband. That’s makes sad. many things sooooo screwed pandemic (e.g. tried buy car lately?) take years fix. COVID controlled fallout dealt with.  still couldn’t find somewhere get vaccine March. finally found one April. However wouldn’t caught ass concert.. Yeah problem totally govt overreach. 

None would happen people took upon act self interest get vaccinated. disingenuous cop-out response. address fact criticism applied logic equivalently applied yours, stated first paragraph.

All claims directly benefit overall public health guideline rather rule. keep going studies shown, I'm telling show sugar excess bad. show sugar moderation better artificial sugar moderation. 

The conclusions derived artificial sweeteners better sugar purely try positively benefit public overall, individuals. scientific conclusion, PR conclusion.

If gonna say I'm worth debating can't really anything that. ""PC load liver? hell mean!?"" Tens millions? would like billions now. vaccine 50% mortality rate, would utter chaos none infrastructure functioning including internet. Japanese Koreans seem handle concerns fine? They’ve decades, since pandemic. think depends organ. Livers last lot longer regenerates really well. Kidneys don't. Lungs moving parts really.. take lot early exaggerating. Also he's otherwise healthy takes care body moving forward 10 years life defined limit, especially he's young. Source: treat transplant patients mention transplant associated cancers. it! Thin herd ivermectin safe! think different 80    get real answer thread, bias towards lockdowns strong.

But ordinary brits, seeing pictures police shooting rubber bullets pepper spraying old women utterly disgusted Australia. It’s global pandemic We’re pins needles every time play “Seasonal allergies COVID” game family. 75% us vaccinated, waiting 5-11 group get OK literally breathe easier heading cold flu season. 

We trust science ready fully vaccinated family moment FDA grants approval EUA.  2000 cases per day would equivalent 110,000 cases per day US. aim endemic still trying limit surges. Learning live virus mean ignore it. There's big difference taking action 20 cases 2000 cases. great point, however covid, it’s flawed argument. 

We know covid spread person starts show symptoms illness. Using public transportation example, Let’s assume one person crowded bus covid, doesn’t feel sick yet, aren’t masked. unknowingly spread covid several people bus. mandate place everyone needs wear mask, matter what, one sick person bus masked, far less likely spread covid another person bus. 

Wearing mask sucks everyone. realistically need get put masks pandemic wanes. Flip flop good way earn respect. sure chance better handle it, pinched warring countries want push favorite theories.  People never real job never know hard get everyone work together. Try scheduling meeting 50 employees meet Friday afternoon discuss new corporate procedure, impossible.  real?

Not sure first estimate though?

🤞🤞 estimates stay fairly close reality. “Yes, it’s definitely Covid we’ve symptoms. wife [I] went couple restaurant next day four us sick. One us went see doctor told Covid, clincher”

It don’t work like that, playboy. 

I think dude faking miraculous recovery thanks ivermectin going hospital Young kids masked nurseries/daycare.

And claims seeing 2 faces parents enough normal development complete unscientific speculation. Children need see hundreds faces normal development, used live tribes. Yes, normally 2 faces, sometimes much  mean, know sell 30% counter usually, man, ingest strong oxidizers, folks, bad time.*

I imagine crazy family swiggin' usual 3% concentration available pharmacies, otherwise they'd probably already dead. I've got one sibling whose family antivax, sucks, sound bad situation 😔 believe Biden said cost may passed employee - would assume time aspect could also passed on. Slipped explanation. Fixed you. ""everyone goes hospital dies"" say people avoid going hospital they're going die. USA 50% full vaccinated vs 80% spain nearly 85% Portugal . think same. Children going even less vaccinated US population whole, 5-12 year old vaccinated they're required schools.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: changed 90% nearly 85%.  rich people regular people

remember joe rogan ""threw kitchensink"" caught covid? continues play whole situation Ben Garrison schizo conspiracy theorist never taken seriously moment. think vaccinate kids developed countries, already very, low risk hospitalization/death receive good health care, many at-risk elderly people developing countries yet able vaccinated. No, remember that.

I remember trying crush curve, hospitals stayed open, hang vaccine.

The vaccine always end game. think they've saying ""September"" months. days left October. kids' school (NJ) 5 cases far starting back Sept. 9th. I'm hoping avoid infection, feels like game chance point. plan wear masks flying rest life, many holidays ruined colds caught plane. would even consider public transport 

Also standard mask cold symptoms going forward. way people used go work socialise obvious cold seems crazy looking back. can't stay home least mask up.  What's over/under long backtracks ""wont go hospital"" part?   guy’s almost 65, he’s sure getting put ECMO last life expectancy went much year World War II.  die home  Cynic here, too. guy, like Joe Rogan, gonna ""cured"" ""Covid"" ivermectin whatever bullshit ""cure"" gets peddled Facebook memes. 

100% grifter. well, probably room anyway.  EventuallyTM

Meanwhile we're wishing hoping deadlier variant reap rest us down, start developing long term issues get reinfected year year year.

See, neither us enough information really know what's coming, hope prepare it. turns prepare nothing, would happy pig shit wrong. right good thing here. mean, there's middle ground had. masks outdoors exercising, masks high risk places old people need use like grocery stores public transport. People selfish.  Sending kid school knowing probably covid pathologically selfish.    Says guy trying cite mortality rate numbers describing case fatality rate. going pedantic, make sure well informed first.  contagious Delta strain managed do. 

Seems like bad argument, much time since delta emerged. Delta emerged 6 months alpha, next big bad strain could evolving right mutates even SARS-cov-2 anymore.

Sure, mean dangerous? way prove parent intentionally sent kid school knowing sick may liable

But parent sent kid school exposure supposed home quarantining criminally liable. Enhorabuena! go get it. going turn away. What's next mandatory slave labor. Ohh wait that's way live. That's spirit think witnessing **The Great Darwinnowing** Republican Party.  Buhbye Lmao like 1% places use ecmo lmaoo

It's funny people think get asking it. Really really lolol.  refusing vaccine get sick get immunity way. Eventually, we’ll vaccinated gotten sick (possibly both, possibly multiple times).

But vaccine reduced illness, *for vaccinated*, something live with. something kill vaccinated people things listed, least large numbers.

Once everyone else gets sick maybe dies, hospital system much able handle things last restrictions go away, least time. prioritize education here. definitely issue pay right now. I'm fresh boat LPN regularly get offers work agency making crazy amounts cash travel. I'm also making way work facility ever would before. toxic work environment burn keeps facilities holding competent staffing. That's even new problem, way worse pandemic.   Aw, Ill miss seeing creative edits people comics.

Spoiler: mostly Cum &lt;!&lt; happen NY. Unemployment cover vaccine refusal, try moving another state find job, federal mandates coming directions, likely matter much longer year court battles done they'll need get vaccinated new job. seem think government bluffing, courts rule favor, they're wrong. Yeah let's inflation make money worthless. Especially people actually worked whole time. There’s defending this, it’s blatantly skewed.

(Click “data table” click “7 day case rate”)  fear Covid-19 seen major flashpoint medicine, widely cited reason physicians, particularly high-intensity hospital settings, left profession. Consider number Covid-19 patients community hospital South Carolina grew zero July 1 average 50 past three weeks. vast majority — three — vaccinated Covid-19, surge patients forced hospital, again, delay cancel non-essential surgeries procedures. reason US higher Black population brought slaves. New Zealand never slavery, Blacks. reason US high Latin American population physical proximity, ability cross border. 

New Zealand far higher Asian, Pacific Islander Maori populations US, point America less 1% Pacific Islander proof diverse. 

NZ 70% White, portion population actually one race. Mixed-race relationships socially acceptable NZ longer US. 

NZ homogenous country, impact diversity even greater foreign-born population higher. cultural differences Black, Latino White Americans American-born families living US generations great cultural differences immigrants raised totally different societies. American immigrant NZ speak first-hand experience countries. 4chan. threads people try come next stupid thing convince idiots do. roughly 56% chance living 10 years double lung transplant. Unfortunately basket population dragging us down. understand, outcomes equal better US  know 42 year old back January. far, think anything far. nothing happened yet, he's clear, right? thing weird happened, serious sinus infection back July landed hospital. never one before.  Guess gotten free vaccine shot   Machismo, tienes eso no.  90 years. Looks right. I've 3 4 grandparents live well 90's. 

Just stay healthy. Agreed worry societal adherence.

Flu shot adherence abysmal.  proud it. impossible convince americans negative effects overweight. People make feel bad *not* accepting fatness.

I bet industries make people fat happy, well ones profit fatness. truth, overweight population highly profitable some. vaccinated times second time? personal accounts getting booster? side effects anything? I'm 31 slightly weight one kidney used smoke vape. I'm interested getting one would like first hand accounts side effects problems anyone may had. Yea description said hard drugs like cocaine. smoke ton weed though, click “smoke less 2 packs day” even things out. guess shortage first responders showing emergencies number infected. absolutely thought going blow over. Every ""next big disease"" lifetime has. nothing compare to. 

I remember sometime, probably around April 2020, seeing Reddit front-page post animated rolling balls scaled represent deathes different pandemics. Covid tiny ball. wish could find post.  anxiety meds

A lot medications blood clots side-effect. affordable, quality care, treatment options, facilities? I'm asking know. We're 700,000 Covid deaths now. family friends 100% vaccinated except kids, we've circled wagons protect immunocompromised.

Such sad stupid ""accomplishment"" U.S. many resources. Spain reached 95% vaccinated. Brazil approaching 80%. Countries vaccine access months months half population turning nose racing past us see near end Covid deaths; meanwhile, today another 2000+ Americans died Covid. 2000. Thing easily make something get medical religious exemptions. ticks off. People medical field believing science believing conspiracies still get make decisions patient care. know fact people make shit medical exemptions clearly state exempt reaction covid vaccine, vaccine. antivaxxers somehow getting doc's consent never vaccine before? country like US vanguard pandemic like this. sure wrong leadership worst time. Jesus! That’s incredibly sad!!!! Mask mandates remain good idea winter surge certainly we’ve chance vaccinate 5 11 year olds get vaccine. got march. Regarding asymptomatic symptoms later, links this? heard yet. ""Please this"" seems said much often expect days.

Bleach? Please this.

Horse dewormer? Please this.  “living virus apart daily life”

This see people’s true comprehension skill. recommended trick-or-treating outside, limiting crowds avoiding crowded Halloween CEO Chairman Albert Bourla said vaccine data kids ages 5 11 would go Food Drug Administration soon. “It’s question days, weeks,” Bourla said “This Week.” someone collapsed lung due spontaneous pneumothorax, really appreciate work lungs fail.

I literally Walgreens picking meds yesterday someone told would pay $77 shot uninsured. uhhhhh. yes are. lot. thanks, come again. comfortable playing scary games like this, afraid get vaccine? anti-vaxxers one local group claim VACCINE 50% mortality rate.. get lot likes sharing videos random ""doctors"". faaaaaiir. High concentrate hydrogen peroxide used rocket fuel alcohol (I think alcohol) WW2. High percentage hydrogen peroxide acts oxidizer ignites alcohol. 

Seems like great thing huff... said, social mitigation still best prevention tool covid vaccines. 

And we’ve failed social mitigation. far, large percentage us also failed vaccination. Medicine also advanced 1918, vaccine influenza available, according CNN. control infections century ago, non-pharmaceutical interventions—like isolation, quarantine, use disinfectants, cloth masks limits public gatherings—were enforced, according CDC.

That said, it’s relevant. Could areas mask mandates children also adults vaccinated? thus, less vectors spread covid?  There's vaccine. Deaths 0, yet still are. husband vaccine listens radio shows way work listens me.

Dang. reward behavior? Agreed it’s different. others said restrictions UK. Interesting compare Israel another highly vaccinated country big wave. Also UK 50% vaccinated AZ, different many European countries must effect. Hopefully UK steady slow burn cases works well long run. 

Equally age groups given vaccine. UK people care homes often given AZ since easier transport. Family doctors often responsible this. often cool bag carry Pfizer family doctors work private business / entrepreneurs may incentive invest buying early on. though buying since want paid give boosters need it.

Compare Spain Pfizer vaccines taken care homes early using cool bags. 

Bottom line lots differences countries High risk job defined exactly. come contact handful people job, probably high risk. Also includes smokers former smokers, also defined could possibly mean anyone even smoked little. surprised kills someone significantly better medical knowledge. ECMO rooms, ventilators, monoclonal antibody treatment 1918? No. Try again. Medicine also advanced 1918, vaccine influenza available, according CNN. control infections century ago, non-pharmaceutical interventions—like isolation, quarantine, use disinfectants, cloth masks limits public gatherings—were enforced, according CDC.  

Those still best prevention tools covid vaccines, even 100+ years later. Yeah keep trying save them. Let Darwin thing Dumb fuck believe article saying 1918 flu 1 150. Covid 1 500. Covid 1918.  Never underestimate dumb MF’s    alone. denial beginning well, even though personally know people part Wuhan lockdown back January 2020, call naivety and/or hubris, thought we'd able weather storm U.S. very, wrong.

Ask actuary. Get motorcycle.  COVID vaccines given free charge everywhere US.

The Federal Government owns shots. US three times population compared 1918. i've got long covid, coming 2 years. i'd count i'm prob 20. understand level disease.

In 1955 bad batch caused polio 40,000 200,000 children received it, even recently 90's commonly used polio vaccine caused half dozen cases polio year US.  

Some history here: there's lot institutional memory incidents causes regulators extremely careful. that’s insane said believed got restaurant, did, next day 4 got sick. thing, take 2-5 days symptoms appear? think he's lying blaming restaurant. next day everyone got sick, probably food poisioning virus possibility, covid? least he'll temporarily stop making cringe comics essential patients country (Ireland) either. ""urgent"" surgery prevent getting cancer delayed 12 months due covid. End result, thankfully develop cancer developed complications resulted surgeries one initially needed.   often take oral drug? then, long?  Unlikely better place, done fucked  waiting long time ago, massive milestone see actually happening. enormous step.  if: symptoms aren’t bad doesn’t see need go hospital? Well health experts would agree that. RIP advance... good riddance work hotel lot towners game yesterday difficult mask on. Kept getting dirty looks asked keep mask point need on. Thank much.
Our curve surprisingly flattening even schools starting seem dangerous reopen even me, I'm extremely cautious.
I think due vaccine also extent infections suffered first two waves, many undiagnosed first one, adding inmunity.
You guys kept much better control Portugal much inmunity illness, 85% seems good level reopen.  Booster anything Delta?  I've trying while. I've wanted booster since got vaccinated back April Pfizer (Canadian here) regulating boosters tightly here. need bring signed note doctor vaccine clinic showing qualify, doctor's regulatory agency number listed well.

Honestly, power make every single one drop dead spot, would. moral qualms me. Thats bit paygrade. Seems specially mild sickness dont develop strong immune response anyways, then, time becomes even less. common respiratory diseases. whole thing isnt black white. Many grey areas, depending person, obviously elderly weak immune systems become suspectible quicker. Idk it. I'm vaccinated I'm still super afraid die Covid. healthcare system non COVID patients bearing collateral damage, well family unvaccinated dead patients healthcare workers  expanded trial based new data 12+ group started getting vaccinated larger numbers trial complication seen adults popped up.

While true, myocarditis still determined extremely rare vaccinated boys, much less rare people get COVID infections. One could argue FDA taken actual disease side effects included children beginning, 10% died vaccine, people would've asking large trial group.

Except zero deaths clinical trials far know. Yes, thought too. wreak havoc NBA NFL, absolutely. meant taught. That'd great anti vaxxers really stay hospitals.

Also, people got 2 shots told side effects first one, second one bad. used EMT, differences severity non-fatal injuries really amazed me.

  Charge vaccine
  Charge directly administration fees, copays, coinsurance
  Deny vaccination anyone health insurance coverage, underinsured, network
  Charge office visit fee recipient service provided COVID-19 vaccination
  Require additional services order person receive COVID-19 vaccine; however, additional healthcare services provided time billed appropriate

Sorry, meant say sheer happenstance, eventually one would randomly hit keys precisely right order pump Hamlet.

This misunderstand. possible, means there's something preventing monkeys getting exact sequence (say, person reading infinite amounts gibberish produced stopping lucky monkey right end), eventually it'll come out.

Actually, would require something discouraging monkeys making exact sequences order eventually make something gibberish.   would love able get tamiflu counter, doubt ever happen. see Covid would different. I'm assuming due lobbying drug industry I'm sure.

Also, already pretty good understanding Covid. Sure still tons learn, clueless flailing like spring 2020.

Beyond that, Delta longgggg gone. omega whatever variant then. never-ending cycle variant--vaccine, much like flu. No, given 3 billion people without research done.

Seriously, anti-vaxxers like throw ""nanoparticle"" around sounds scary. means tiny. handled like fat molecules. cells know care came vaccine.   would Canadian healthcare system actually pretty shitty. ICU capacity non-existent compared US Europe. still people claiming everyone vaxxed dead two years time. french youtuber's comment section beliefe widespread. infinity repeating identical gibberish infinitely.

Who would making identical gibberish? saying every monkey would typing thing?

Because be. one would typing own. sheer happenstance, eventually one would randomly hit keys precisely right order pump Hamlet. 

Unless there's something preventing monkeys getting exact sequence (say, person reading infinite amounts gibberish produced stopping lucky monkey right end), eventually it'll come out. nurses

are burn maskes thing fucking obvious vaccines better idea, can't believe Bolsonaro want take credit beggining... he's really plain fucking stupid... even mom took Chinese Coronavac vaccine ofically hided vaccine card public.. sons wife vaccinated too... Spoiler alert: normal taken back shot never coming back. Please ask people experience, get someone anecdote meaningless. Pregnant women high risk severe disease Covid, H1N1 flu 10 years ago. young women end ICU Covid pregnant. Getting vaccinated helps her, provide passive protection baby IgG crosses placenta. Multiple studies show adverse outcomes vaccinating pregnancy. American College Obstetrics Gynecology Society Maternal Fetal Medicine strongly advise pregnant women get Covid vaccine. Surprised OB told this-- maybe has. respiratory virus going around months ago. Weeks later still struggling breathe. told classmate got new inhaler try help told using nebulizer hydrogen peroxide. way talked it, convinced good thing lungs. bought nebulizer try peroxide Googled safe side saw bunch red flags. ended asking doctor prescribe abuterol nebulizer instead.

When desperate help, easy open hippie alternatives. see people falling it, like ivermectin bleach thing.   smell/taste back? wearing masks every year. 

Why not? seem complicated.  OK. Bye! problem wearing mask want. mandating without good reason ok. Covering faces inhibits human communication expression normalized outside pandemic. Well, personally fail deliver promises, entire government (some idiots). 

The anti-nuclear stance something National Labour governments unilaterally agreed past twenty years, that's specific her.

Yeah, cannabis one tricky. Obviously, right keep opinion secret democratic (albeit, non-binding) vote. time, clear Ardern's stance (her party one proposed referendum, Greens) due Mormon upbringing, legitimate chance might said personally disapproves given close margins ended being, actually declared stance anti-cannabis, might deciding factor killing Yes vote.

We're less hurry secure Covid vaccines 26 deaths. countries need urgently do, also given us time watch effectiveness vaccine roll-outs Covid-ravaged countries better design ours.  always get flu shot...  point surprised people start drinking lava. believe iron lung made supply work Diaphragm skeletal muscles breathe. people paralysis caused polio. don’t think iron lung anything damage lungs affects actual gas exchange. common. Maybe news media tends focus more?

From CDC data 557,054 total deaths 12,087 2.17% 40. expect hospitalization numbers also similar.  Dance naked around oak tree midnight bury toad 10 feet north side…this cure clap &amp; Covid… me, wearing mask public great. I’m bus, don’t worry idiot doesn’t know cover dumb mouth  matter, lungs equivalent deflated balloon. Damage done. Ruins oxygen exchange capability. someone explain man got double ling transplant people whose lungs failing get lung transplants? believe that’s Walgreens worker moron breaking law. Walgreens charges anybody vaccine actually puts government payments risk. gentleman complain corporate HQ straighten morons out.  asking really going add whole lot frankly misses point. Looking unadjusted death count context created multiple workable vaccines 1 year start pandemic incorporated social distancing measures performed many people still got numbers did. makes wonder happened 1918 that. yes converting per captia going make covid deaths look alot smaller compared flu, that's point. easy do, dont go hospital. People live bubbles, heads far ass they're recycling.  Wow. I’m sorry experience sure still lot better yellow fever. mist likely vaccinated young child probably minimized reaction vaccinated teen adult. country yellow fever routine young children that’s probably never heard anyone reaction (even though make vaccinated second time adults). maybe I’m lucky… also absolutely reaction Pfizer either (aside arm felt like would fall next day) Without hospital intervention, doubt survival odds strong. Especially 64 year old. Definitely 99% survival antivaxxers cite. That’s absolutely correct, government pay insurer Walgreens tries charge patient they’re risk losing payments government. course many random pharm techs may saying wrong thing people happens patient probably complain Walgreens corporate. wonder breakfast?   Yes rising somewhat compared decline cases Question cant find much information internet. 

My 13 yr old nephew got 2nd shot Friday ended side effects coughing, fever, fatigue ect Sunday night S/O complaining feel well. way could connected? 
The CDC website said vaccine contain actual covid, makes protein fight anyone else experience family members feeling unwell someone side effects shot? 

I'm trolling, I'm concerned family. look 65 70 year old parents want make sure drop groceries I'm going effect them.  ways spread lies, Honestly, wants take horse medication die COVID go right fuck ahead misinformation he's spreading makes people like real villains pandemic.  difference watching videos coming China Italy first part pandemic. Chaos hospitals, people collapsing streets, church's piled high caskets....Iike normal flu season looks like unless I've missed event happening every year  even mean? arguing someone *is already vaccinated* fucking progressive cant accept total stranger legitimate medical concern voiced thier doctor getting vaccinated early on.

Like, even trying achieve arguing medical history? I'm vaccinated already, doctor. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

People vaccinated mild breakthrough case. Personally speaking like cold sleep wake mornings bit sore throat hour never think sore throat bad. course people think bs.  Good taking bed.

Hold line, brother! You’re probably confusing years. I’m 100% certain you’re talking Christmas 2020 Christmas 2019  hasn’t explained well media, “almost hospitalised” mild/moderate case.

Many people seem think mild means “barely symptoms, could easily go work wasn’t quarantined”. cases like that.  “I feel absolutely awful, barely get bed” also counted mild. Easter… Honestly pretty bizarre, waiving CDL requirements?!  never really doubt got it, much easier claim never got (especially admitting serious effects like severe weight loss).

The real danger statistically speaking probably recover do, go speaking tour reason survived made medical regiment. someone check location history guess already hospital. One school board members believes actually said board meeting. 

It’s going make great ad campaign he’s re-election…which sadly year. Many deaths technically preventable—almost since vaccines available. COVID going cause lot death sickness matter what. COVID got wild China, game rest world. surge New York preventable even know COVID spreading. point, COVID already prevalent going spread matter did. Pandemic detection messaging must improve next one happens.   Sure, could mild case fine. people get COVID- even Delta varient- require hospitalization. 

So, yhell miserable weeks say horse meds vitamin C pills saved him. barely distribute vaccine globally something simple refrigerators we’re supposed deploy injection robots work? Yes. Ivermectin made Merck, one largest pharma companies world (who literally come press releases saying ""in case, please give us money). 

It great drug fighting worm infections. (as far current data shows) covid. big pharma product.

It like saying order stick big pharma going take tylenol headache, going take insulin. Um, still giving money ""big pharma"" less effective dangerous way. can't make cum edits dumb comics  Pay nurses exploded overtime basically unlimited. end January 2020, spent week Disney World. remember hearing bit covid time thinking much it, although remember one moment entertained idea ""what actually really bad, someone it?"" around many people week, without care world. weird remember 2020 - brain wants say 2019, 2020 = lockdowns. way could better headline included ""so far"" Also age gender appear factors well. Incorrect injection wouldn’t explain either. Anyone adequate high school education able understand vaccine science. (Noting many people inadequate education.) - ok Byyye!

Travel nurse make 200k. doubt many actually walk away. small amount anti vax nurses (crazies post memes Facebook) surprisingly large amount vaccine hesitant nurses I’ve noticed. Ty!  day asked worried son’s heart permanent damage due vaccine. Ignorant C students ""dumb"" way career whilst continuing put around needless risk.  There's lot critical thinking hospital level.

That said, good riddance.  make good point, sad reality Native Americans counted Americans purpose sort thing. US talks ""American"", mean ""United States"", dumb is.  Sad story, apparently deceased bit skeptic himself:   hope what’s best country happens. work vaccinated tested weekly. first foremost, get yo damn vaccine man. high risk places testing manner track breakthrough cases effectiveness controls circumstances. first, get yo damn vaccine!  know crazy believe every hospital, doctor, nurse care giver every place around world part giant conspiracy

on side note way many areas anti vaxxers :/ unbelievable studied still.  Well, nurses assume risks, that’s left. Allowing unvaccinated family members bedside, don’t wear masks even asked (or become belligerent) hospital wasn’t even testing them. 

Once vaccinate 3 year old, I’ll go back work. then, that’s much risk someone child congenital condition increases risk complications respiratory illnesses. place find live data r0 rate various locations? Someone said nurses quitting mandate, know something. mentioned fact 95% practicing physicians vaccinated. Got hit back ""Lies"". people lost cause. fact reinforce want hear lie. 😕 CUM guy?  Yikes. 

4 9 seats November election. 3 candidates basically Q-Anon, really big money local backers. opponents struggling get shit together, it’s really upsetting see local Democratic groups don’t kind primer run office when, social media tips, etc. 

I’m quite worried November.  Fomites absent wild.   hope keeps word stays hospitals, then.  


More power you, boyo, long keep word stay them. Let's say even 15000 died vaccine. September 26th, 6.13 ***billion*** doses covid vaccine administered. 15,000 dead 6 billion doses.

And covid? 219 ***million*** cases worldwide, 4.55 million deaths.

That's something like 6 billion fewer cases covid vaccine, 4.4 million deaths. According fake math that's like bajillion times likely die covid. fucking stupid. I'd rather take chances vaccine.

Thanks compliment! realize reason like bc subject, truly say think well done. like angry humor like this. Must go that. must trust science *after reverses earlier guidance, evaluating new evidence*.

Best example early masking guidance national equivalents (CDC, Health Canada, etc) basically amounted to: mask, effective. based largely established size threshold aerosol droplet transmission (5 microns), set almost 60 years ago. threshold [an accidental misinterpretation tuberculosis transmission we're understanding actual threshold may closer 20x larger (100 microns), proposed even earlier study.

There's also idea officials may lied save masks healthcare workers early days, given info link above, I'm going give benefit doubt say honestly thought that, based scientific consensus time, larger COVID19 virus ""had be"" droplet-based transmission, kept 1-2m apart (an option possible healthcare workers) sanitized hands surfaces regularly, ok.

Anyway, evidence quickly showed COVID clearly transmitted farther existing knowledge would go, science-backed guidance pivoted 180° yes, mask hell goddammit! kind shift seen ""flip flopping"", ""they're clueless"", ""they're making things go along"" clearly passed grade-school science class.

So, although certainly correct NY hit hard wave many areas US, least local problems medical system COVID. free....flaccid...vaccine full money vaccine job. vaccinated mean never catch COVID. vaccinated means mild symptoms (which did) Hank Aaron died two weeks got vaccine. also 86 probably much it. Finally, one anti-vax people courtesy take space hospital! Hopefully fans follow example!  ""Generalized whole population"" centers around risks people 50s/60s, looking CDC's data. Maybe survival rate bit lower that. dinner someone felt sick next day, probably already covid several days that. ask this? nurses know is?  Best luck Covid I'm fine this. Live stupid, die stupid  That's Ben Garrison sentence I've ever heard lost much weight he’s falling rabbit hole.  People refuse take reason. really vaccinating children still countless vulnerable across world gotten even first dose? data says low risk. Mike Ryan said, ""it's like us wearing two life jackets, others drown.""

I surprised lot countries widespread rollout 12s. He'll still run hospital things get worse. health care system not. Oh, great technical point view, financially? No. researched vetted information medical professionals going stop idiots idiots. Get ready nebulizer shortage.

For us, however, aware things choice, least necessarily. awareness threatening interests. Mostly class interests. obvious anti-vaxx whose interests served. There's nothing stopping getting vaccine telling reporter never get vaccine. [as starship captain clear, want be. exactly anyone however, regardless vaccinated are. thing still circulating much higher rate flu even highly vaccinated areas. Bye. Satan plays big role vaccines too. cant forget  Honestly, bet dude got vaccine tell people snake oil cured him. That's great news actually follow (doubtful most).

Also shame Gizmodo. Half article direct quotes images him, giving platform spread dangerous, debunked medical advice.    Also, Fauci politician all- he's epidemiologist. literally spent entire life working studying for. beyond ridiculous lengths people gone place politics like saying Yeah really get either. vaccine paid tax dollars...and given people ""free."" Whereas literally pay ivermectin. he's trying say something politician's insider trading profit Moderna/Pfizer guess that's one thing, think trying say that.... He's ""treating"" beet juice  Masks also make much harder communicate, especially traveling conversing foreign language/foreign language speakers. They’ve also hell deaf/hard hearing community.

However, point heard that, started grouping 6mo-2 2-5 group. idea changed groupings affects timing 2-5 group.  *worse articles tests hard find. wife personally struggled get tested last week.

Frankly, matters end part:

""The family's ordeal inspired least 60 friends, family colleagues get Covid-19 vaccine, Susan said.""

And that's I'll keep getting every day again. somewhere, sometimes, make difference. went 15k person concert Vegas, went 2 airports flights, walked Strip, hung casinos indoor dining. COVID me, got 2 rapid tests returned. got vaccines February. YMMV, course.  Tldr: mandate included ""if vaccinated, get tested weekly"" clause.  so-called unknown causes grew 30% Brazil first year pandemic. specialists, data shows underreporting Covid-19 deaths. unknown cases include, example, registered home hospital, without assistance unknown cause.  total, 97,436 deaths type country 2020, compared 74,972 2019 — increase 22,464 cases one year. According consortium new outlets, would represent 11.5% 194,976 Brazilians killed Covid last year.

The disparity excess deaths averages largely due gaps covid reporting.   Serious answer - branding marketing learn “ladders mind.” 

Advertisers spend millions importantly “years” create ladders 🪜 minds 🧠 climb place products. 

It’s may associate Medical Leadership say Harvard Medical School Quenching thirst Pepsi. (Note - sometimes ladders get created hear see.)

Rupert Murdoch (FOX News) Republican Party spend decades creating ladders mind conservatives (freedom = acting alone ones interest) (anything democrats say = socialism) (tax hikes rich = bad poor people middle class)…..

When COVID-19 came used existing ladders position covid vaccines.

But sure already knew this. body choice, duh ""experts"" word century. Ok, still sent spare food clothes possessions Afghanistan. Surely poor people need do. Community pretends COVID isn’t real it’ll go away....

How’d work? dumbass get memo, we're done 5g towers, we're shoving ivermectin asses! Apparently not! easier believe conspiracy admit idiots. Ignorance pursued sheriffs ignorant. Karma. Strawman. Seems like you’re assuming things here. Numbers gone sharp objects ward. super strict that. hate people. hate people much. right call. need stop optimizing part population refuses listen reason. Seriously, I've hard time getting info kids 5. anyone know that's supposed happen? thing ever hear ""after 5-11 group"", obvious Theres also ethical issue. adults take decision yes, help family also society. ask 6 year old take risk trade vs side effects? UK looking like barrier set age 12. Either one eats one person eats everyone's coleslaw Fine. Show recent stat portrays differently. percentage going change time soon unless jobs pulled. Sure quick say people age 1000 people infected, 5 die. low. 

Then look studies say people high vit high levels zinc higher rate survival. 

Getting covid death sentence. vac group, choose to. health choice.    Well, get planes, go work (as teacher !!) according HCA posts.

I know family got (2 adults 2 kids) pre vaccine (2020), almost certainly caught *teacher* class *all day coughing*. One kid brought home, three got her.

The kid (7) almost asymptomatic, kid(2) completely asymptomatic, parents shitty couple weeks hospital well enough look kids, thankfully would dodgy much older parents look kids. 

All OK long covid (unlike older neighbours one took 6 months fully recover. Again, pre-vaccine. deny care.  Everythings joke ot isnt. storage requirements mRNA vaccines changed? make entire continent like that. massive cities across Africa infrastructure, yet nearly every country less 1%.

African countries repeatedly said problem supply. Rich medium-income countries simply bought up. bothers me. president would survived. team doctors best, experimental treatment knows else able survive.

Basically means test tube. killed covid quickly. would need tested humans...in noses. people complain knowing long-term effects vaccine using unproven, dangerous treatments. understanding Pfizer said phase 3 clinical trial would September. seems putting together data FDA. seems like hit September timeline. 

If source someone Pfizer saying would submit proposal FDA September happy edit comment (and give kudos).  Ah, ok. joke specific layer ""it's hoax."" Thanks - makes sense. whole thing weird. nearly every African country less 1%? There's also need wasting it. Children vaccinated flu countries there's likely chance Covid. Let clear, vaccinated recommended, approved. think speaking person already mindset existing covid vaccines US legitimate one reason another therefore horrible evil whatever. already mindset, much jump add greed mix. point matter consumer directly pay vaccines, getting one would mean participating evil scheme/scam, could use refusal participate fuel righteous indignation, tell refusing get vaccinated, preventing players financially benefiting evil schemes, increasing smugness 10%.

(Now want know person might think vaccines legitimate, ask extremely drunk person explain talk anything whatsoever. nonsense argument used argue ridiculous point like. Imagine inserting argument here.) Still, ever forget circles. documentaries come 10 years true costs stupidity, fucking forget. Lol same. seen bird flu, swin flu, west nile virus, Ebola really thought week two wouldnt hear again. that's thing. That's knew serious was. really thought we'd okay but...

We've seen 25% decrease hospitalizations since start month. I’m bit hard hearing class mask nightmare. it, gladly, I’m constantly people repeat themselves.  I'm shocked also frustrated vaccine sufficient prevent catching 

Thing is, know many times potentially exposed COVID beforehand time since vaccinated amounted nothing. Yea one time broke got theres good chance least couple times since vaccinated exposed catch due vaccine.

The vaccine never meant end-all-be-all foolproof force field ever catching COVID. meant reduce chances getting (which numbers show clearly has) small chance get it, makes almost surely die, hospitalized, severe symptoms (which case, obviously did). It’s stopping number. pandemic isn’t over. Imagine covid hit 1918. fact deadly treatments available today, can't imagine loss life would back :/ consider way less intrusive masks...a spray two day. safe- worst case dry nose. Lack evidence due lack study covid. Proven staff infections.
Politics...maybe, simply alcohol suspension. Would take real true believers ""something"" issue. big takeaway that, spite every advance modern medicine availability vaccine, healthcare system worse 100 years ago. U.S. managed stagnate ability take people mattered most.

Vaccines never intended stop infection entirely. Vaccines don’t fact efficacy 50% prevention would gotten vaccines denied EUA.

*Clinical* efficacy. criteria EUA prevent disease, infection. It’s actually title EUA. Umm no, plenty studies indicating true delta.

No, aren’t. Studies show always end heavy criticism opaque poor methodologies far know there’s one study directly looks vaccinated shedding. showed reduced vaccinated people. Bottom line ton age underlying conditions dependent. 

That’s we’re discussing though. large scale studies, date, show waning immunity community spread amongst highly vaccinated populations time, face delta.

No don’t. show spread slows within vaccinated portions communities. one proven vaccines two dose regimen basing public policy assumptions already looking false ridiculously unhelpful.

This makes sense. Regimens determined, discovered. don’t prove regimen, accept don’t. data right shows 2 dose mRNA people covered. ive talked Bill Gates Foundation reply post   Cleveland Clinic study vax rate employees Covid previously 59%.

I really expect win hearts minds. Would nice, nope. reasons still respond are:

- help others make fact-based decisions. (Admittedly, fence-sitters remain there. always folks gotten memos.)

- support rational folks among us.

- help prevent misinformers flocks completely taking bandwidth.

That's it. 1. General growth anti-vaccination movement, even within medical/nursing community (you’d surprised many nurses don’t get flu shots year year)

2. Related #1, generations removed seeing actual devastation many vaccine-prevented diseases (yes, COVID deaths, general perception mostly elderly. much might healthcare profession, elderly deaths aren’t important. Nursing dominated younger women mothers, situation would entirely different kids dying children risk).

3. Political persuasion. They’ve convinced particular side political spectrum vaccine a) doesn’t work b) dangerous. think, incorrectly, risk vaccine getting COVID.

4. Related #3, lack understanding safety, efficacy, relative risk. Nurses take science classes, don’t necessarily understand science, method study, mean trained think scientifically (tons love sincerely believe shit like astrology).

5. don’t like told (I’m kidding). work infection prevention, I’ve tell take virus seriously think vaccine works, don’t like told get it. makes sense chose get voluntary, fact it’s starting mandated really shouldn’t make difference. 

6. Religious belief (they claim it, it’s bullshit). religious sects actually vaccination, major religion leaders saying vaccination acceptable since helps save lives. might talk vaccines aborted fetal cells (they don’t, vaccines made immortalized cell lines originally derived fetal tissue 1960s-‘80s, which, them, bad). However, would true J+J vaccine mRNA vaccines, made purely chemical processes. Pointing makes little difference. religious exemption, cite arbitrary biblical verses justify choice already made (I’ve seen 1.5 page passage cited, word word, least 4 individuals, anti-vaccine website convenient copy-paste available non-ironic excuse take care others). I’m religious, although grew church, know lot good religious people live beliefs. people using religion shield selfishness, which, far I’m concerned, makes claim faith worthless. 

I’m sure more, seen dealing specifically tracking infections vaccination rates, providing education COVID, pandemic, vaccines.  that's right. quote Kendrick Lamar's ""For *They say scared, go church; remember, knows Bible too*  could deadly second part headline literally reads…

Douwe Bob announced decision last night. ""I've refused entry movie theater first time QR code,"" said video message Instagram . ""And stories became real: 'You can't get in, code.'""

This autumn would perform various places throughout Netherlands, want start current corona rules. ""This became musician. want give people love bring beauty good time myself. tour. I'm going it. discrimination great.""

Rapper Fresku stops tour: 'I think: together not'
According singer, discriminatory spectators welcome prove QR code tested negative, vaccinated recovered corona. artists therefore decided earlier cancel performances reason.

'Technicians duped'
""It's great artists stand principles way,"" says spokesman Peter van den Bunder Kunstenbond. ""But whose expense happening?"" According him, often underestimated many people, besides artist, involved performance. ""That varies two technicians light sound production thousand employees, Eurovision Song Contest.""

Accompanying musicians, light sound people set designers almost freelancers. ""The pain completely dependent others income hardly absorb risk even canceled performances year half corona,"" says Van den Bunder.

“
If artist feel comfortable something, benefit show.

Sound engineer Casjan Berends artists refuse performances corona passes
Sound engineer Casjan Berends also lost income due closed theaters. ""I 30 percent normally earn spend pots built future. tough, know many colleagues much harder.""

He plenty assignments weeks now. ""It's madhouse"". also lost job artist refuses perform corona passes.

Understanding
Berends much trouble corona passes, understand decision singers comedians. ""If artist feel comfortable something, benefit show. sound engineer, job make connection artist audience. performing artist feel right, try hard can, nothing.""

According sound engineer, part job depend whim artist. ""It's artist without inspiration. normal job still say: bite it. artists something like really gets way.""

Yet Berends says want downplay consequences. ""If canceled performance means difference technician able pay mortgage not, lot suffering involved.""

Kunstenbond: pay technicians anyway
The Kunstenbond concerned performances canceled corona passes calls Douwe Bob artists: ""If really want make statement, delete performances, pay support already have. enabled.""

Sound engineer Casjan Berends calls union's call sympathetic, realistic. ""The margins sector far small that. exception large subsidized companies, nobody afford that.""

He hope rates technicians go up. ""Then would better create buffer next crisis also take decent insurance incapacity work. income joke compared rate average plumber handyman."" can't export doses? else think Africa get from?

I say country see much concern children. data show extremely low risk countries rush vaccinate them. Ireland example wait next year. also wear masks contact tracing schools. mean?

 He'll live.  

Suffer long term health effects absolutely.   
   
Says can't smell taste. lot folks last months longer. Lakers announced would fully vaccinated start season. hospitals get extra money Covid death reports, necessary keep fear ramped up

Um. die outside hospital, death count? wh brain malfunc  amusing, totally awful haha. Jaded physicians good patients. Yeah, people bad remembering things.

First ""we'll starting trials kids days""

Then ""We'll preliminary data kids days""

Then ""We'll data kids days""

Then ""We'll submitting data TLA days""

Now ""We're going ask approval days""

but ""kids get shots days"" yet. that's people think weeks. missing point vaccinating kids, large part mass vaccinations important. matter healthy 2nd grader ""ridiculously small chance developing severe COVID"". That's need vaccinated.

Honestly hole knowledge epidemiology big, discussing subject. Read basic knowledge:  well stop testing wont covid See long anti-vaxxing bullshit lasts start losing millions. unvaxxed person working heathcare right now. Eligible persons willingly remained unvaxxed business allowed type work.  1. Moderna boosters approved anyone yet immunocompromised.

2. Cross-brand boosters approved even really discussed. get vaccine starts costing income. vaccine, can't play.  can't play get paid. injury, suspension. knows Lebron holding out. Otherwise wouldn’t thing.  give week see follow-up article ""yadda yadda... passed away due Covid complications"". Ugh people. Whats definition zero harm? 

2nd kid 5 OC dies covid - kids hospitalized covid suffer brain damage related issues - want vaccine? That's fine. Sit season out. said baseball, too. I'm Mets fan certainly happy watch Nimmo Conforto take field reckless behavior. clarify, 5 cases one elementary school (500-600 kids faculty). whole district way more, nowhere near 3000.    Latin, means “in lab”. people recover Covid without issue... Holy shit dies frame cartoon date death bottom. Fuck Garrison. put stuff pulled pork sandwiches here. man... real MVP real MVP responded yourself, forget switch browsers another account?   exactly reddit get idea nurses underpaid? Healthcare salaries high US across board. RNs require particularly high credentials (you 2 years) still make $75k. Right overtime getting minimum $100k. blame electing become traveling nurse right there's infinite demand get paid lot justify travel/generally spend time between, like getting paid north $200k 2 4 year degree actually fair market rate outside extreme conditions we're right now. Wait, guy willing gamble family's life somehow COVID less damaging ""what stuff do...years now"" explain ""trust science"" exactly (""literally"") ""do research"".  


No false equivalencies here, folks. Move along. Good, save hospital rest us fucking morons. powerful words Yeah one waaay head lol. witty comment brother serious needle phobia hasn’t gotten vaccine. hope pill nasal whatever comes soon. It’s either he’ll get knocked get shot.  can't. People like deny zombies threat wander street. CANT SOSHULIZED MEDICINE CANADAS WAIT TIMES SEEN WAIT TIMES!?

/s 😩 Good sticking beliefs staying hospital! Vaccinated people need beds.   nurses stupid. 


The far educated, smarter doctor‘s vaccinated. rich early country hopping get vaccines. award named man died last year COVID, twitter account continued tweet anti-mask stuff even lay dying hospital. W means ""winner"" nominee accepts award leaving mortal coil. sub that's nice reminder COVID still much real deadly disease. We've one grade school far, month I'm honestly shocked. again, high vaccination rate adults masks required everywhere everyone. Amazing works. Absolutely. dealing people, especially children people act like children, crucial obviate oppositional impulses offering choice. not, ""Sit still!"" It's, ""Would prefer play next room, go outside swingset?"" break Rule 1. break Rule 1. break Rule 1... least he’s consistent. hypocrisy anti-vaxers trusting doctors make safe effective vaccine, trusting treat Covid getting old. thermally agitate add HOC(CH₂CO₂H)₂. day now. Imagine believing every doctors nurse National conspiracy together unable comprehend universal healthcare. Good guy Ben Garrison happens anti vax contacted covid taking place hospital. like Ben anti vax.  multiple masks, they're high quality, including wire nose bend fit tightly, fog.  Maybe nose glasses different yours, maybe I'm heavy breather. (I've worn mask bike riding, actually worked better - think moving air either blows breath away cleans fog. I'm indoors problems.). sometimes put masking tape around mask, work, annoying.   Well, nice knowing him.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hate VAERS system become potent source misinformation. really needs limited healthcare professionals researchers, public can't trusted properly interpret safety surveillance data. I'm 100% favor anyone would look Garrison cartoon life advice guzzle much horse dewormer can. I'm ok  appreciate court opposed it. know US. country's health system embarrassment ""don't tell crowd"" exponentiating problems. Either clogging vital health sources people like article person responding to, nurses burned they're leaving hospitals droves.  
   
Because issues, doubt saw winter deaths last winter. doubt even it, great way proclaim easy get over. honestly wonder if/when Automod flag mere phrase “prayer warrior” uncivil. Still true back Jan/Feb, risk infection/death really high. boosters Pfizer thing basically anyone qualified get Pfizer January, compared 3 doses Pfizer 2 doses Moderna get booster approved. Even 3 doses each, they're effective differences matter much (and take account difference risks side effects, rare make judgement). really vaccinating children still countless vulnerable across world gotten even first dose?

The U.S. [the world's largest donor COVID Clearly, part increasingly ramping help nations around world can't get vaccines themselves.

On hand, within U.S. significant number adults refuse vaccines, well politicians hostile vaccines sort mitigation effects COVID-19. lot parents U.S. see people threat health children frankly short seeing enemies would someone trying harm children means. people also standing way anything close herd immunity, there's way protect children adults get vaccinated.

It's completely logical want vaccination prevent kids getting COVID given high instances long COVID potential chronic health problems reported. Additionally there's much way reporting suffering going globally, U.S. news reports people getting sick locally problems brings. Many Americans believe world outside U.S. chaos times anyway. weighing morals standpoint, countries even really factor majority Americans. I'm saying that's good, explain things.

Personally, I'm group wants kids vaccinated really care happens willfully unvaccinated developed nations point. want see richer countries continue expand donations vaccines also expand vaccine programs within borders well. logistics distributing vaccines globally simple seem believe choice U.S. donating Africa give vaccines kids -- throwing vaccines away unused thousands upon thousands versus giving children. Every individual vaccinated win, continue improving fight pandemic globally, there's nothing wrong starting locally. like thought Onion reason genuine political cartoonist realize parody. Ben Garrison indistinguishable. Except there's actual research done ""trust science"" people trusting rather straight talking ass ""I research"" group looking at. mean, that's big difference.  would take ketamine?? FIRE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.

This also remove lot extremists domestic terrorists ranks. everyone else doing? Children important want keep safe  physician sucks. $200 office visit anything annual physical. guess I'll get Pfizer. People taking horse size doses stuff..not big stretch Ya - SF General allowing bay area understand. really easy get get it.  take *ton* it. guy probably thinking drank 10 ounces per day years. Duh. UV course. far fewer 75 year olds walking around 1918?

No. Even normalized death rates (per 100K) worst 20-40 group. (absolute death counts course much worse)

E.g normalized rates Spanish Flu age group Apparently he’s treating beet juice. Walmart won’t allow that. look got last time insurance. Look, I’m going trust people who’ve made life’s work study immunology mRNA technology lot someone went U Tube confirmation bias.  know, level, really can't anything else. need able live end this. lose family, can't go home thinking ""What tried explain, asked?"" ask. know answer, can't live without trying least much. know they've exhausted options try help someone love. 

It must frustrating able side well. think know could impossible situation. 

Statistically idiots though.   pandemic gone away. takes longer kill Covid, mean less deadly. fact lot deadly COVID chances dying much higher contract it. hope find physician sympathetic giving vaccine want.    education. know people masters decline vaccine. also need dumb. Wow, wow. got Moderna booster J&amp;J vaccine April. Hospital SF allowing it. I'll let know grow 3rd eye somethin  thought sure would taking Invermectin stop lol sucks. Looks like cannot get Moderna all. Oh no! Anyways…  Oh no.... please remove Kyrie Irving.... stop....

Maintains 
Oxygenation Severity side effects ≠ efficacy  make Robotron! Watch Brain Wave. hanging around level case numbers little mini rises falls quite now.

 Schools back little mask wearing teens able get vaccine recently. lot people given wearing masks there's pretty much restrictions. I'm surprised much higher. We're LOT testing good. We'll see winter pans out.... I'm sorry loss. People 65 highest rate COVID hospitalization. Unless government ends Medicare program, Feds pick big part tab COVID treatment.

Several billion per year COVID vaccines save far Medicare fees, Social Security disability people get long COVID etc. Lots unhealthy lifestyles, vaccinated, wearing masks. Yeah guess, could bloated anti rejection something.   got big bottle 3% hydrogen peroxide make surface sanitiser near start pandemic. 3% isn’t strong occasion I’ve got skin making solution cause white marks fair bit irritation (I sensitive skin). 

Don’t dare imagine would feel like inhaled! days say many Well,

Bye may die hards like bet cave experience air hunger. Yes. That's thing decades now. feel bad people insist making sure head unscrewed.  what's disappointing part? he's always fucking asshole enabling even bigger assholes Man, trolling point. mean least 90%+ vaccinated NBA. ones gotten would problematic whether NBA not. CBA NBA really language mandating it, commissioner's hands tied. several city's local ordinances may stop unvaccinated players playing there, face monetary losses. really know else NBA could push players. Yeah folks straight grave dancing that's cool either  Biggest threat 5G adoption:

~~Chinese hackers~~

~~Power outages~~

~~IP laws~~

Antivaxxers Good. Hope holds strong gets severe. Wish would follow lead. Hopefully he's spreading public places either though. know plenty folks are. Good. Keeps room hospitals people need it. Didnt realize r/politics  get one get. third doses, Pfizer like 97% effective. marginal benefit could get Moderna going make much difference terms absolute risk. waiting around hoping get shot meantime much risky. Nurses terribly underpaid (well, assuming reasonable working conditions patient loads)

A lot techs, nursing home workers, aides,etc criminally underpaid  happen know vaccinated?     making stuff creating baseless claims unvaccinated, easily disprovable. need cover massive LeBron hate boner dude Sheriff elected position. That’s good point. polio vaccine issues, remember 1950s. Comparing COVID vaccine like comparing polio vaccine 1880s. actually that, since science generally improves exponentially.

But agree. last thing FDA wants huge amount side effects deaths children improper dose lol true, knows anymore. story posted day. Dr. actually saw news reached get there. happened better nominee. go hospital Covid, place bets whether pneumonia. Many ignorant folks fixin' ""yee last ""haw"". Nobody vaccinated   legitimately, bullshit respect people sticking guns like this. mean exaggeration; disagree someone profoundly, absolutely go shield, respect begrudgingly. Anti maskers antivaxer big problem UK. sounds like trying use tragedy unrelated commentary   Yes, think we’ve also done disservice de-emphasizing humanities. History, Literature, Pholosophy, etc. “useless” classes (in terms grooming specific job) teaching think memorizing know. 

Source: me, semi-disgruntled former Lit major computer scientist got mouths feed. 🤷🏼‍♂️ ""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.""

/r/COVID19/comments/jm18yh/longitudinal_monitoring_of_sarscov2_rna_on/ come hospital lot refuse medications saying they’re “experimental”. makes want take pillows hold faces.  Supplies things like needles staff probably bigger issue places mRNA itself. dosing probably mostly comparing benefits risk. 

If 20 1 million people vaccinated 50ug end hospitalized vs 16 1 million 100ug dose (hypothetical numbers, reasonable guess people 19-29 assuming third dose moderna 50ug slightly effective pfizer), 4 1 million hospitalizations vaccine actually matters. young males using data mix pfizer+modera, risk hospitalization vaccine 20 1 million, difference risk hospitalization 4 1 million age group pretty likely. Especially given got 250ug dose trials much higher rates severe outcomes used that. 

OTOH, 65+ less 1 million chance myocarditis, much gain benefits vaccine (even 3 doses, risk probably still several hundred per million).

It would nice could low high dose version vaccines like flu *IF* studies show statistically significant absolute benefit (given current environment) outweighs additional risks. convinced literally like 1 person this

Have *met* Republican?? Roger Murdock right! ""Keep government medicare"" He's suffering way want to! possible!? 😟 Must faking . That's way. 😤

Nevermind fact control Dr.'s literally tell go hospital can't breathe. Sorry death able celebrate tho 🥺 RIP advance: Ben Garrison Yep, even include typical antisemitism. yeah much better coddle scumbags prolonging deadly pandemic  think sucks knew getting into. information easily/readily available. knowledge Covid kills people. I’m saying dont like “oh yeah people deserve it” saying, don’t try bear weight extending deep sympathy towards 100% humans. unrealistic really creature 100% compassion, hence wars *literally disagreement ever* . 

So people, although extremely tragic falling left right screaming echo chambers, information prevent inevitability death turned noses away form professional advice guidance.

Edit: words England, Denmark, Norway already removed Covid restrictions.  know 100 year old medical orthodoxy took pandemic challenge... hospital worker actually gives hope! wish every anti-vaxer would chose stay home get COVID. zero deaths clinical trials far know. 

Well yeah, judging CEOs remarks, there's apparently deaths serious side effects, that's trials. hindsight, could've skipped trials completely.    simpler analogy then.

two pots water milk heating.

A small pot water left boil, deemed hot spills (flu 0.67%)

A bigger pot milkis taken fire simmering, boils still spilled over, (covid 0.2%) labelled prone spilling (deadlier), spilled way reaching boiling point

Like water milk, will.

What think would happen let covid/the ""milk"" overheat fully?

(edit : sorting analogy, I'm painkillers) cartoon looks like propaganda film Sorry Bother     understand point comic, vaccine free, money? vaccinated covid basically flu. take precautions flu season past? Would consider trying get without insurance? government cover cost able get it. Whether legal health ramifications problem future. bet least 3/4 Automod deletions thread invoke well-known former pizza executive.  Exactly. kids' high middle schools zero in-school transmission they're masked windows open. pretty easy create safe environment. everywhere, search it. can't believe something people think. I've seen people say ""isn't weird virus targeting republicans now? Makes think"". Yeah, makes think think.  Good, deserve hospitals bed.   understand point, easy American Academy Pediatrics say expanded risk trial going poorly rest shoulders. 

I think FDA acted best interest children, extended trial new data became available. think agree would horrible go process something bad happened received type approval. Interesting we're trusting Chinese vaccines Russian. mean, we're really trusting China proxy still feels bit weird.

What's gotten really curious though, happened Sputnik II-IV go Sputnik satellite Sputnik vaccine?

Did Russia hire Yogurt merchandising consultant something? tough remember mobile  (kind morbid) chuckle think back reacted early pandemic. Like airing Amazon packages garage stupid shit like that... understandable really know better.

Now take sheriff. might extreme covid denier, anti-vaxxer, whatever want call it... bet even looking back like ""damn, wtf for."" certainly seemed questionable time, commonplace covid infections eventually became blasé reactions infections? really funny hindsight tried silence one person saying ""I covid"" least they're getting vaccinated guess. I've awarded free award easy minutes earlier... u attitude towards wrecklessly unprotected anal sex catch hiv well? know better right? Nothing gets head, would catch it. sick receive antivirals

Is really ""too sick"" rather late? time virus longer around active. wonder Ben Garrison like Trump get monoclonal antibody injection late? Perfect. tie bed hospital staff. Sounds like win.

Now, could get anti vaxxers behave like this.   Show support mandates, move needle measures failed. part raise awareness collateral damage unvaccinated.  everyone stupid enough think work this! sick stupid people let themselves.  wait. Waiting gets sick. Waiting gets people sick. Children die flu. words, conservative conspiracy believers. Obesity 

Management “conditions” way medication rather exercise healthy eating 

Poverty broad based financial stress 

Lack access affordable health care 

Lack social support 

Institutionalized toxic masculinity, racism, sexism classism ages people 

Childhood trauma None police area worn masks all...throughout entire pandemic. Fuck em expect people think “experts” everything?

No matter much something, world doesn’t play rules. everyone listed COMMON side  Hmmmmmmm. group mental mindset would opposed performing greater good vast majority citizens ? Bingo. amazing news!  Kiiiiinda seems like garbage taking Dang got 95 - sure want around long 😂 Someone willing spread hoghly contagious deadly virus people rather protect community essentially willing murderer. like someone drives drunk. stay friends person.

I've found mask, socially distance, vaccinate, going continue long necessary haven't... continue so.  


I feel lucky things going well around here, considering shit show places experiencing. :( Extra bonus points wear [Plague Doctor work. Fingers crossed nothing bad happens... Lmao jk Australia finished rollout including Czechia Poland since behind iron wall. Wait — news me. miss this?  like ignored poster said. Throwing difficult transport vaccine countries without **logistics distribute it** result vaccines thrown away.  

Who donating 50,000+ refrigeration trucks African countries? running electricity areas without it? building roads refrigeration trucks drive on? COVID-19 vaccines created equal *logistically*.  

Your whole argument boils to: ""Just ship vaccines, problems solve [*somehow*]."" could solve actual problem maybe we’d universal healthcare US al adults vaxxed none would problem. Obviously reality telling us otherwise.

Rest assured, parents leery giving kids vaccine whatever reason. Supply won’t constrained won’t mad rush get vaccine even current shitshow. look number people proudly advertising lied way third dose, them

Well, believed half that, might reluctant get vaccine — especially trump’s winking support conspiracy theories overlapped lousy shit Facebook CDC FDA’s approval vaccine.

Great point It’s constant vigilance us; don’t see much changing youngest get vaccinated, knowing feel lot safer. billions outside US. expect follow minority?

The metric system obvious example here. I've realized greatest threat disease pose long incubation period still contagious high mortality rate.

Well, AIDS fits bill: close 100% mortality treatments, asymptomatic possibly years. HIV's R0 apparently greater 2.5, ballpark original strain SARS-COV-2. cycle time lot lower, obviously, saves us. remember least one link study Israel showing concerning number kids showing symptoms. long COVID thing difficult wrap mind around much data.

I don’t think data 5 months ago referenced.  Yes really.  

Look transport requirements mRNA-based vaccines explain they're getting transported impoverished areas sometimes lack paved roads, electricity, refrigeration vehicles, funding operations (since countries literally cannot afford *logistics*, even $0 vaccines).

When want it? NOW! I'll disappointed dies. Like soooo disappointed.  Basically right now, something like 90%+ players vaccinated. Theres stadiums restrictions say vaccinated in, like players New York LA pretty much required. players teams got yet interesting.

The NBA say cannot play it. think impact low them, many players vaccinated, want make statements like stir controversy. used think epic internet future since everyone stay informed everything could possibly need know, good crowd sourced reliable information. Really elevate humanity higher level, prevent type getting set ways mention.

In reality done make people seek information want hear, participate echo chambers. Also *everyone* impacted whether believe not.   call ACTUAL example violation person's First Amendment rights.   official CDC guidance getting Moderna booster pfizer 1+2 shot? boosters even non-elderly? got mine January lot faith I'm protected 9 months later. Unfortunately live third world shithole (Mexico) vaccinations super slow, lot people taking it. I'm calling across-the-board change, I'm calling willingly unvaccinated become low priority. taken basic steps protect yourself, also carelessly putting others risk. 

These people get care impact others. expecting happen sooner, like two weeks schools opened. There's nothing even treat 99% time. Covid laughable 99% people get it. might even know it.   Like vaccines—they’re effective taken *before* get sick!  problem is, works full protocol

2. Bleach eyes
3. Betadine mouth
4. Horse worm pills gut
5. Hydrogen Peroxide lungs grandchild virus caused spanish flu pandemic hundred years ago still around causes deaths every flu season. theorized covid mutate milder form. Still, vaccination risk groups yearly procedure. Mainly asian countries people voluntarily wear masks flu season. questionable westerners wanna that, countries ease rules already, so, theres definetly going back normal. Still, likely flu covid remain burden healthcare system. flu now. corona viruses mutated harmless common cold viruses. Thank you. explanation solved me. start recommending Cyanide Arsenic treatments people. Seems like easiest solution problem. problem answer, truth hard swallow millions people. fact easily manipulated, identity market construction, much ego ever accept. Yeah know, that's lean it. shit bed act like good thing order save face. Adults every opportunity get vaccinated, significantly helps prevent that. point, accept possibility possibility rest life, illness honestly activity ever. Thanks well wishes! may seem like much really helps.

On re-read feels like trolling sympathy; intention, sorry that. inform disruption covid given medical systems around world far reaching wide impact, ways completely grasp (and certainly includes me). Even countries strong infrastructure lots wealth hardly escaped unscathed. Sadly expect hear stories like poor mother's quite time, hope learning something least two steps forward every step back. Okay know what? bad. Even though said ""the world"" reason thought meant US. Which... dont lot pity willingly unvaccinated. 

However, already doses here, they're here. unfortunate death rate children risen. dont want take risk.

I get saying, dont good options right now. certainly dont want see children die, doesnt mean Im okay adults countries dying either.

It's shit situation right bad options case, go best bad option have. people want protect children here.

Im saying right okay. best right now. That’s ridiculous think whoever listening doesn’t understand Covid spread. Way stick medical industrial complex taking drug made Merck.
