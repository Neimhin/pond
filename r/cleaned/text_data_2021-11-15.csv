Background/objective 
The COVID-19 epidemic particularly serious older adults. symptomatology epidemic profile remain little known population, especially disabled oldest-old people chronic diseases living nursing homes. objective present study comprehensively describe symptoms chronological aspects diffusion SARS-CoV-2 virus nursing home, among residents caregivers. 
 
Design 
Five-week retrospective cohort study. 
 
Setting 
A middle-sized nursing home Maine-et-Loire, west France. 
 
Participants 
Eighty-seven frail older residents (87.9 ¬± 7.2years; 71 % female) 92 staff members (38.3 ¬± 11.7years; 89 % female) included. 
 
Measurements 
Mass screening SARS-CoV-2 performed residents staff. Attack rate, mortality rate, symptoms among residents staff infected SARS-CoV-2 recorded. 
 
Results 
The attack rate COVID-19 47 % residents (case fatality rate, 27 %), 24 % staff. Epidemic curves revealed epidemic started residents spreading caregivers. Residents exhibited general respiratory signs (59 % hyperthermia, 49 % cough, 42 % polypnea) together geriatric syndromes (15 % falls, 10 % altered consciousness). classification tree revealed 100 % COVID-19 probability following groups: i) residents younger 90 dyspnea falls; ii) residents older 90 anorexia; iii) residents older 90 without anorexia altered consciousness. Finally, 41 % staff members diagnosed COVID-19 asymptomatic. 
 
Conclusions 
The pauci-symptomatic expression COVID-19 older residents, together high prevalence asymptomatic forms caregivers, justifies mass screening nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents suggestive combinations clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness.

Restaurants still open quite full (dining common here).

And never big outbreak thanks masks. (Not social distancing. Hard distance single apartment building houses thousand people) Gottleib's outlook:

1. [A fortnightly ONS antibody estimating overall community seropositivity (using representative random sample thousands households), and
2.

Both high, assuming generalises countries suggest seroprevalence quite comfortably higher blood donors general population. Clog hospitals take medical resources away people need it.

If want see covid causes lingering symptoms often diseases hospitalize people, compare others hospitalized (don't believe studies done this, though).

If want see rate lingering symptoms people covid, need representative sample people infected (ie this, since mostly hospitalized people) compare matched cohort non-infected people (meaning match demographic factors like age pre-existing conditions) see much frequent symptoms amongst infected. couple studies done something like this, they've found extremely low rates lingering symptoms (as compared control group).

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Food Drug Administration aiming authorize booster doses Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine adults early Thursday, move would expand number Americans eligible additional shots tens millions, according people familiar agency‚Äôs plans.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention‚Äôs independent committee vaccine experts scheduled meeting Friday discuss data booster dose‚Äôs efficacy safety. F.D.A. C.D.C. sign week, acted strikingly quickly ‚Äî little week Pfizer asked authorization boosters everyone 18 older.

Under scenario, adult received second dose vaccine least six months earlier would officially eligible get booster soon weekend. F.D.A. expected rule without consulting expert panel, met frequently pandemic review vaccine data make recommendation ahead regulatory decision.

Moderna expected soon submit request F.D.A. broaden eligibility booster. now, every adult could get Pfizer booster, according people familiar planning.

The broad booster authorization viewed something fait accompli weeks. state local officials begun rolling similar policies ahead F.D.A. action ‚Äî responding persistent virus case counts eagerness many Americans seek additional protection ahead holiday gatherings.

New York City health officials Monday encouraged adults want boosters seek out. Arkansas, California, Colorado New Mexico already moved expand access.

Many Americans, regardless live, taken matter hands sought extra doses even officially qualify yet.

The F.D.A. September downsized Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs request fully approve booster doses adults, instead signing limited population, including 65 older, well adults underlying medical conditions risk jobs.

At least 30 40 percent vaccinated adults still excluded booster eligibility, according estimates.

More 30 million people gotten additional shots, number often outpacing number first shots given day around country. Booster doses also authorized October everyone received single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, vulnerable groups received Moderna‚Äôs two-dose shot.

The C.D.C.‚Äôs gathering Friday scheduled briefer recent meetings Covid vaccines, three hours, expected straightforward, one federal official familiar planning said, part far nation‚Äôs booster campaign already come. would suggest significant softening opposition among public health experts since President Biden announced August hoped offer booster doses adults.

Mr. Biden wanted start campaign late September, announcement heavily criticized public health experts, said rushing federal scientists regulators decide whether data supported move. Members F.D.A. C.D.C. advisory committees said uncomfortable quickly administration wanted offer booster shots large swath Americans.

Some key regulators outside advisers hesitant endorse sweeping booster campaign early, arguing effectiveness two-dose regimen, especially preventing hospitalization death, held strongly. One large study New York nearly nine million people shown remarkable durability protection gained three federally authorized vaccines.

But recently, federal regulators scientists said evidence increasingly clear reduction vaccine efficacy milder Covid cases, protective antibodies, put Americans ‚Äî especially seniors medical conditions ‚Äî risk harmful breakthrough infections Delta variant virus gradually loosens grip.

‚ÄúAntibodies decay time. That‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine story,‚Äù said Dr. Ofer Levy, director Precision Vaccines Program Harvard‚Äôs Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital member F.D.A. advisory committee. ‚ÄúVaccines vary durability protective response. starting see waning age groups well.‚Äù

An Israeli study published scientific journal Lancet late October compared 730,000 people received booster dose August September individuals received two doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine least five months earlier, finding boosted recipients lower risk hospitalization severe disease. booster shots evaluated one week nearly two months third dose.

‚Äî Noah Weiland Sharon LaFraniere really want get every 6 months forever

There's currently reason believe naturally case.

The initial doses given close together time affinity maturation. Boosters may much durable. Many vaccines given schedule spaced months apart. initial doses compressed due need get approvals phase III quickly get largest number people immunized fast possible. Nope nope nope, I‚Äôm even going ask work company. don‚Äôt wanna know. üòÇ State vaccine laws + federal government mandating things supposed left states = precedent federal government mandatory vaccines.

Sorry dude, don‚Äôt understand well think. one going around saying boosters make impervious infection. I‚Äôve seen anyone suggesting that. 

It lessen overall chances suffering breakthrough, it‚Äôs guaranteed. 

Delta extremely virulent.

There rather large misconception initially original two dose vaccine regimen mRNA vaccines showed strong overall infection protection, original even Alpha strain. Delta + time made high level protective immunity unlikely. 

At stage it‚Äôs reducing severity first foremost, hopefully preventing infection combination booster still using common sense minimize risk contraction it‚Äôs appropriate. pandemic far over.

A highly intelligent jock exception, never rule.

I kinda give fuck thinks. 83 percent blood donors infection-induced vaccine-induced COVID-19 antibodies May 2021, according research published Sept. 2 JAMA Network. would number today, 6 months later? people forget there's decades ""dumb jock"" memes hundreds movies?  LIke that's applicable joke reason.

A highly intelligent jock exception, never rule. 


I kinda give fuck thinks. COMMAS PLEASE know technically coincidence strange mid cycle spotting Covid shots. Lots things cause spotting.

But take lots cycle notes tracking app I'm data nerd instances spotting pandemic. never happened after, say, flu shot vaccine I've recent memory. 

So I'm 100% buying link. think big deal, I'm pro-vaccine, aside cycle regular stayed track. happen, note it, timing little sus, all. Really perpetuating dumb jock stereotype. Good job. would disagree. reason double vaxxed individuals showed good resistance early Delta wave due vaccine new. time passed, infections deaths among vaccinated increased substantially. Minnesota 60% vaccination rate, 40% deaths vaccinated individuals rising. There‚Äôs obviously alternative factors may play significant role, it‚Äôs clear boosters way go initially double vaxxed. 

I‚Äôm one shame unvaccinated. It‚Äôs endemic, live it, there‚Äôs means people substantial risk may protect effectively. But, vaccine immunity wanes people don‚Äôt option fully protect themselves, that‚Äôs serious problem. No. people think this? Republican race, would least vaccinated enormous amount.  I‚Äôm shitty Doctor, guess going medical school mistake. Oh well, I‚Äôll quack on, money‚Äôs good. vast majority antivaxxers Michigan black Hispanic?

I friends super religious completely anti-vax family 3 young kids COVID family (tested positive doctor) twice past year. husband works public business mom makes things sells fairs such. 

That scares know lot people get vaccinated reason, really hoping would immunity already it. family got back January/February (if remember correctly, would look precise, beginning pandemic) recently got again.

I shop tesco though anti vaxx twats could boycotte would great. we're approaching 6 month period post-vax lot protection drops off

people falsely going attend parties thinking they're protected  annoys people complain health safety measures taken claiming we're worrying much virus less 2% death rate. completely ignore surviving mean fine. LIE.     [ourworldindata - 35% fully many got Sputnik V? Light? EpiVacCorona? bought cert without getting vaccinated? Could trust 35% all?  Since 86% 12 county fully vaccinated safe here.

Minnesota Democrats seem think vaccine = cure, precautions longer apply. fact allow full capacity sporting events 5,000 cases day vaccine/mask requirements venues better DeSantis Florida. beyond frustrating. self selecting people empathy, willing put mild risk benefit society whole.

Of course vaccinated people. Probably fit ""agenda"" something site. mild infection? Singapore G7 nation almost 90% + vaccination rate.

The US always strong individualistic culture, things public good caring others tossed aside denigrated recently. make sure non sneak introducing vaccine certification checks üëç Giving selective information way anybody conveys information ever. Heres example: Tom Brady greatest quarterback ever play NFL, proof hes 6 super bowls. see there? left fact also LOST 4 super bowls, didnt help make truth clear people. truth hes great QB, yet leave truthful, misleading, information order convey know truth be

Nobody give perfectly accurate information, always based perceive truth be. people though filter facts story make sense humans. OP did, understood group people associate hate groups, provided factual evidence that. perceived group differently, would provided different factual information, get understanding truth across people.  UK never opened vaccinations everyone initially. key group vulnerable. opened 1st. enough capacity open 40s. need wait 6 months get booster, many us 40 yet eligible. end Dec / early Jan. sure next move 30s etc. Whilst Austraila may opened all, many actually eligible? Bullshit.
Period came whole week early second shot.

I never kind cycle jump happen except weaning child breastfeeding.

There something there. lazy, careless, underfunded make effort.

We see convex function changing concave function. means Rt value slowing down. 


Is possible want sacrifice people natural immunity? certain point amount infections drop (with cost thousand lives probably). Probably much bureaucracy means everything typical day day stuff results chaos, nobody coordinate whole thing.    comment deleted protocols UK, comment here:

There really protocols schools. mum works primary school, ages 5-11. Masks required anyone. Tests done twice week staff sure asked enforced. Ventilation horrendous schools 99% air condition they're going cold unlikely windows open. 

The biggest age group cases UK 10-14 year olds. recommended vaccines 12-15 year olds 3/4 months saying no, we've recommended second doses.

We got lot stuff right UK, vaccine uptake much better anticipated, sold end pandemic get vaccines. 

Data  think numbers 16+ population entire population. Australia's entire population, 69.64% vaccinated. 
It's difficult find rate per entire population reason [this keep date it, amongst stats. ranked list countries near bottom. And? mean exclude calculating percentage total population vaccinated. countries mentioned probably either. Like others said, KNOW body! track periods. first vaccine crazy heavy, irregular periods times months. 

 started back normal got booster days ago we'll see does. people filling restaurants bars? masking one eats drinks. Japan‚Äôs case wasn‚Äôt regulatory issue supply? IIRC Japanese regulators require trail data inside Japan, slowed approval months.  This\^ Magical thinking old fat, whatever. Ignoring fact high blood pressure, etc. think people outside sub could list ""old"" risk factor. local library system mask requirement local UPS. Two safest places area.  definitely feel you‚Äôre talking man, constant shifting goal posts. It‚Äôs shame I‚Äôd like visit Singapore sometime near future. 


I‚Äôve conundrum Japan. originally gonna go Tokyo grad school, Japan doesn‚Äôt wanna open foreign students time soon despite high vaccination rate strict quarantine testing requirements anyone arrives. Government keeps constantly shifting goalposts it‚Äôs frustrating. Interesting thing I've seen UK. England masks mandated anymore uptake experience quite low now. Scotland still mandated. Case rates similar though. could we're close many things politically mandate make difference people's eyes, always argument initially ask people wear use properly. Maybe happening, UK mandated clinical grade masks, cloth. also like many people invested moving on. local small town paper covered local pandemic meaningful way since last spring. several people die last week according state's website. local TV station still report things, covers large rural area necessarily go county county. says area getting worse announcer looking grim, take point.

So, know people intelligent thought could get booster til 8 mos. since last heard going that. (They've gotten vaccinated since.) hairdresser tell fully vaxxed need mask, wears one comfort level. positive get 3rd shot despite obvious co-morbidity. like info level still stuck back last spring CDC said--take masks, vaccinated! next ONE paid attention said put back on.

Detroit woeful vaccination level seeing much coverage pandemic Detroit Free Press--not like used cover it. biggest paper/news source state!

Until hit 90+% vaxxed, doomed continue like Groundhog's Day.

I starting know people breakthrough cases too. CDC never track bc wind hospital.

The 15th opening day deer season. hunting camps friends family state last weekend. even Thanksgiving, yet. December going match April December 2020 sure. second part sounds odd happened germany get killed bureaucracy  antivax aren‚Äôt even anti vax. covid don‚Äôt see point. 94 percent adults, last checked. Weren‚Äôt upset Christmas somehow cancelled? cancelling Christmas themselves. important question is: people put masks hachiko? hard compare Japan's case death numbers since never implemented mass testing strategy. ample supply

We don‚Äôt. Vaccines expiring shelves. Lots places shortages. booster help saves lives.

The clinical efficacy 6 months people without autoimmune disorders 65 held. There‚Äôs evidence boosters save lives. 

People getting booster don‚Äôt qualify CDC guidelines, actually clear, abusing vaccine wasting it. They‚Äôre either selfish ignorant, flat out. Meanwhile, even officially reached 70% mark full vaccinations Germany... Although study claimed actual number 5% higher, many vaccinations properly registered counted.  Well say that... ever experienced Japanese work culture really shouldn't.  Flanders, country; vaccination rate 81% (92% people older 11). 


We still see huge surge big restrictions starting soon. (yet announced mandatory vaccination health workers 4/5 days working home minimum). 


We around 3000 people BElgium hospital 7 december take action. havent allowed 12s vaccinated yet.  Australia relatively small adult population points pandemic Covid hospitalizations 100,000 patients one time amount people admitted discharged large amount people. mean astronomical amount increased spending people taking money care terms Medicare, Medicaid, federally provided healthcare private health insurance. social security system paying lot receiving less people rendered physically disabled disease actively working contributers systems. businesses faced consequences yet another condition causing tighter labor market. huge amount fiscal pain whole lot situations, insignificant portion fiscal pain could avoided people listened everyone president local pharmacist took needed, freely provided, vaccine course. Ireland 75.69% total population fully vaccinated. getting confused 12+ population, 89.6%.   LOL also sure! that's ok... happens reddit. Would love hear voter... 

The point trying get across like... Man! That's fucking awesome! immense respect Japan. One absolute favorite places. much respect Japan I'd probably refrain living I'd probably skirt line side annoying foreigners. want that. go there, cross cross walks appropriate times, I'd eventually end fucking pissing people off. I'd unknowingly walk restaurant know remove shoes. I'd something inadvertently offensive. 

Are ex-pat? Another reason intimidating trying pick Japanese language would (for me, brain really REALLY struggles picking new languages, Japanese language joke) would lead understanding customs, what's appropriate, etc. 

Anyways, again, Japan, (from visitors standpoint, maybe knowing nuances political unrest, etc...) STILL really amazing. one checks restaurants cinemas etc now

I got checked vaccine status Saturday 100% time.

But never checked, actually person ... Syria also recently got 1 million Sinovac doses WHO.
Hopefully 1.5 mil doses speed vaccinations   That's hard believe unless counting children. 16 probably represents least 15-20% (just guesstimate) country. would imply almost 16 older vaccinated near 30-50% 16 also vaccinated mean asking seriously, earth could get anywhere near level considering like 70% germans vaxxed whereas virtually 0% last Christmas?

The Covid-19 variant dominant last year R0 3 (So every case could lead 3 others cases without measures) dominant Delta variant R0 8 9. even 65% poplulation fully vaxxed, get new case ratio last year. Add vaccines 100% effective measures way less strict last year, bad winter coming...   Spaces nothing, commas way go, neither decimal points..  handled better? reward it. government refused open back despite ridiculously high vaccination rate. Things still can‚Äôt go back normal even Singapore everything ‚Äúexperts‚Äù recommended. seems goalposts opening keep shifting. First it‚Äôs get 80% vaccination rate. got even exceeded that. want? seems like people interest keeping restrictions going indefinitely. I'm expert, read several articles long COVID. sounds like something different immune system issue. symptoms people long COVID immune system issues, remember correctly, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, fever, headache, exercise intolerance, etc Ireland 90% 2 doses. herd plan start making vaccines alot expensive 1st world countries soon. think people missing point here. MASKS!! think 9 cases covid Metro Tokyo yesterday, city 12,000,000 people. discussions loosening mask mandate. Everyone wears mask Tokyo. Everyone. rest world hurry ""get back normal"" listen to/heed science. things getting bad again. GEE! wonder why? see news clips TV CNN/BBC etc, people wearing masks. long time Tokyo resident, fully vaccinated since mid July. eagerly awaiting booster shot, wear mask every time leave house. definitely much, much heavier one I've ever second Moderna. And, weirdly, much, much lighter one I've ever booster. got COVID Halloween party hosting karaoke day Halloween, suburb south Cities. vaccinated April guess wore got pretty sick, infected husband, four kids grandkid. feel like ass. let guard guarantee happen again. 

Everyone acting like pandemic over. think they've lulled false sense complacency. (I know was!) care begin with. going get worse gets better. Let correct you. Moderna booster half original doses, Pfizer one first two.  Europeans shambles Spain around 79% 2 doses Portugal even higher. Although G7 countries Probably, realized push people vaccinate, people must recognizing danger. bit late, sincerely, little effect, I'm afraid. stats, also benefit higher vaccination rate. 

It's true less children, also true makes higher vaccination rate easier. Singapore pretty much everything right, US EU treating like plague Covid cases rising bit. country that‚Äôs vaccinated handled pandemic way better EU US. sure got downvoted maybe topic, right. I've 30 years love it, everyone stay long term.

To get back topic though, articles like one another reason I'm glad stayed. need reasons.

But Japan's culture mostly agreeable cooperative time what's getting Covid relatively unscathed. government made share mistakes, big ones, social attitude familiarity wearing masks made it.  South Korea's currently 78% fully vaxxed, though member G7. [Because need actually research making claims rather regurgitating hear liberal sites  Good point. Finally legit reason wearing mask!  Yeah, know ages 12+ UK vaccination rates 88% one dose 80% two doses, example.

I'd guess Japan highest could much comment demographics (relatively old population international standards) vaccine uptake. worst thing Facebook can't point misinformation without promoting shows wall. People miss ""commented on"" part think sharing headline. try correct people spread misinfo. know could've caused happen? remember going hospital sinus infection couple days so. couple months ago. wonder mentioned also related. never got one whole life then. know multiple people gotten multiple times never get bad. Italy 73.5ish Minnesota snowbirds headed Florida. Winter here. 80% 12.. actually 68.5% population, like 75% Japan

I checked sure Italy 80%, 84% 12 fully vaccinated, 73.5% whole population Similar story Australia. Almost one vaccinated time Delta hit shitcunt PM arsed picking phone ordering enough country. actually enough go around, well 83.5% fully vaxxed nationally 91.3% fully vaxxed populous state (NSW). (and people) scared catch virus - probability (healthy, normal weighted athlethic male 35 45) getting serious issues unlikely. problem is: Small probabilities, spread large number, still give large numbers. 1% 10000 still 100.

Currently, Austria ""produces"" 90-150 new ICU covid-patients. 2100 ICU beds (24 ICU beds per 100k population, puts us top 5 Europe). People stay ICU \~20 days, makes approx. 20\*120=2400 ICU beds needed - Covid only. heart attacks, car accidents, cancer surgeries usually require \~1600-2000 ICU beds without covid. means: We'd need min. 2400+1600=4000 ICU beds (plus staff), \~2100.

I‚Äôm impressed china managed vaccinate 76% population 1.4 billion. Guess authoritarian government good something study done using full dose Moderna tho right? Moderna boosters half dose (at least Canada). Pfizer full dose. Curious difference type dosage.  It‚Äôs still **pandemic** unvaccinated: high rates hospitalization death 

But vaccinated, it‚Äôs largely moved *endemic phase*: still circulating, level risk, within generally tolerable levels sans major mitigation efforts 

Problem is, groups interact other, perhaps importantly, share hospital capacity &amp; healthcare resources - unvaxed group shrinking, it‚Äôs still large enough can‚Äôt collectively move endemic phase Gonna need actual enforcement consequences things change. went CVS Walgreens turned away. CVS ask questions gave Moderna booster. Enforcement hardest part covid restrictions. Let‚Äôs hope better time people gets pissy regards government policies social media time. there's substantial opposition hard find went Walgreens today turned away. received J&amp;J back March. made appointment online answered questions. due get Pfizer booster. arrived, asked met Pfizer criteria. not, lie, pointed website CDC say J&amp;J recipients 18 least two months qualify. tech kept showing piece paper fill stating met Pfizer/Moderna criteria ineligible. showed paper said J&amp;J recipients need fill form. refused, able let go. called pharmacy back clarification, told heard J&amp;J booster anywhere. said website, said national site may apply state. called corporate, said mistake mine chosing location offered Pfizer (none locations J&amp;J available). told mix match. wrong? eligible? Donald Trump's legacy, too.

My parents alt-right rabbit-hole fortunate get of, educated mother speaking talking points back vaccines cause allergies. Now, tells Joe Biden minions stole election.

sigh...  boosters looking necessary efficacy seems wane 6 months so. got mine mean you‚Äôre wrong, happens often enough anyway. **Nov. 16, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Also study already dated Moderna boosters tested full dose boosters half dose sizes compared 1/2 shots. immunity based body creates antibodies stop virus, vaccine protects virus, vaccine tricks body thinking infected onto making antibodies fight virus, takes time protected getting vaccinated. way many people know vaccines work know virus actually work. also vaccines limited zero effectiveness strains.

to effective vaccine prevent catching infecting others virus total idiot. dude shut up. Plus he's *super* risk since he's overweight thousand years old supply problem? Australia they‚Äôre open everyone Ok...story time!

I can‚Äôt see possible reason you‚Äôre complaining that. attribution link article. /u/Viewfromthe31stfloor absolute herald throughout pandemic, trying help people stay informed. I've relatively ""mild"" cases flu confirmed flu doctor.

One time, saw doctor going send away office prescription azithromycin, antibiotic. tested flu request. test positive. never saw doctor obvious reasons.

The flu yucky aches pains sickness distinct common cold, experience, even ""mild"" case.  Liquidized computer partsüòÇ live Michigan seems EVERYONE around getting now. fact household got COVID month ago. wife vaccinated boosters. got it, 12 year old (who in-between first dose second dose) got 7 year old ... somehow, avoided it. really isolate wife got pretty sick (not dangerously anything bad flu) deal kids....

This seems situation everywhere. people personally know gotten COVID, aside children, vaccinated. I'm trying find info this. can't go school two weeks coming back US, we're seriously considering taking kids first day Christmas break.. think studies measure efficacy starting two weeks. mean get 0% first 13 days, know much. thinks second helping horse-dewormer. anti-vaxxers switch ""I want control body"" ""I want control body""?

What problem people getting vaxxed? wish simple showing statistical data. simply wave saying: ‚ÄúThe numbers inflated‚Äù I've flu handful times unpleasant, can't recall ever felt like going die.

Extreme fatigue, hair loss, dizzy spells, etc. pre-existing conditions.  effectiveness vaccines depend heavily live lives around you, one get. 

Natural immunity may lasted longer places people vaccinated took measures stoop mitigation. Bc chances breeding running mutations rarer. cdc naively assumed people would get vaxed states would uniformly enact measures. 


TBF vaccines work variants, reevaluate define success. prevented deaths large scale, reduce severity symptoms, decrease likelihood contracting Covid. 

Other counties might vax too. 

Humanity failed us. signed county NY clicked working living high risk situation. one asked question (besides wanted new card since first one ripped).   exactly right. kids school mask mandate prefer act Coronavirus make believe boogeyman. currently home schooling them, seems like choice. live rural Michigan person ever see wearing mask. cannot believe folks want kids unmasked treated pandemic like joke choose vaccinate.

And yet still, despite evidence models clearly showing **cannot** stop catastrophe without nuclear power (reminder **every single** IPCC scenario limit climate change 1.5¬∞ relies increasing nuclear), left vast majority """"""environmentalists"""""" still they're ideologically opposed. ""Follow science"" works like it, huh?

And worst part republicans likely pro-nuclear even *don't* believe climate change, would perfect compromise even politically. no, gotta keep beating renewable drums.

The guidelines purposely vague hell, need get word *anyone get booster shot want one.* Yes that‚Äôs important know! Alright y‚Äôall I‚Äôm happy report received third jabba hut! Stay masked when? German speaking countries utter trash comes vaccinations. Way man Schwurbler. vaccine equity nonsense damned.

Well, nonsense all. *is* crucial get many people vaccinated possible, around world. that's actually boosters make sense--it seems poorest countries constrained distribution, supply, rich countries constrained antivaxxers. Boosters perhaps accessible option increase immunity.

And studies pretty clear waning vaccine efficacy. chance significantly lower vaccinated people's ability spread covid, top protection hospitalization, need take it. risk profile children &lt; 5 astronomically low [1,804 hospitalizations [210 deaths also statistically far less likely involved spread, by-and-large yet school.

So continue hold FDA approves vaccines 0-4 based numbers? two shots year.

We definitely **not** know this. efficacy symptomatic infection wanes 6 months 2nd shot *not* mean necessarily see similar waning 6 months booster shot. Maybe waning happen rate; maybe protection still wane, 12 months, 24 months, longer; maybe protection noticeably wane even multi-year timespans. 

We know yet. Also, lot people ever saw donated pretty old. group large high vaccination rate. Okay vaccine demand low. 

How qualify demand low? significant majority people went get vaccinated. low demand? Compared what? enough expired demand went up. 

You‚Äôve lost me. Demand gone what? Less people going get boosters got first shots causing mass shortage.

Again, according what? saying *lots places*? means also means everywhere. *Mass* would imply majority. *Lots* implies few. So...where it? provided evidence such. fear mongering problem.

Where mass shortage inferred poor comprehension? don‚Äôt know feel obligation entertain.  Believe not, guy listen me. now, basically saying want keep restrictions forever. There's broad agreement among epidemiologists covid never go away never substantially better now.  never comment - also chiming say BULLSHIT. cycle affected (heaviest bleeding I've 5 years). 

I'm worried least. something study many women experiences contrary. medical gaslighting stop. ""The outbreak occurred prior boosters made available."" Smart move. flu cold season starting up, mention there‚Äôs still going pandemic going on. üôÑ ""Dangerous"", case simply means jobs put higher risk exposure virus, person work home interacts multiple people every day honestly say without fib. agreeing me, need ""but"" almost make sound they're different countries different geographies, peoples, histories, cultures, languages, laws, foods, etc. Nearly everything said incorrect.

Vaccines reduce infection substantially. 3rd dose block vast majority transmission.

Masks work take off.

Please spread misinformation. fair bit data suggests longer periods vaccinations, 6 mos, fairs better stronger longer-lasting immune responses. Got jandj booster 2 weeks ago gf got next day. Convincing everyone family quit fucking around go get booster. Figure since convinced get jab initially forceful time around. Yes stats 18 12 up. stupid?
I'm dutch btw read it. really hope open soon. cancel dream trip 2020. Selfish, know. hoping pill put end covid (not virus problems causing). looks like should, one thing realised many predictions around covid completely wrong. Fingers crossed panacea need friends medical field who've gotten boosters last month. tested positive covid two days ago, mild cold-like symptoms thankfully.

By means, everyone get boosters, one think getting booster means they're completely clear potentially contracting virus still. Either way, I'm sure plenty antivaxxers who'll use breakthrough cases braindead outlook this. 77,000 employees do, they‚Äôre exposed fewer people wear masks everyone wearing cloth masks instead protective masks. oh no‚Ä¶the timeline matches üò¨ CDC didn‚Äôt actually anything though. actually read article?

I‚Äôve able schedule flu shot simultaneously. cool. I'm sure yet. [Here study Tufts shows Black White folks similar levels vaccine hesitancy, Black folks lag behind vaccination rates suggesting causal factor. study also finds Hispanic/Latino Asian Americans lower levels vaccine hesitancy White Black folks. 

[Here another study Kaiser shows factors associated vaccine resistance low levels education, younger, Republican. read article, pay close attention discussion differences groups says ""definitely get"" vaccine, group says want ""wait see"" safe effective. ""definitely not"" group predominantly white Republican, ""wait see"" group Black, Latino politically mixed.

But none surprising least people familiar research literature race/ethnicity trust medical industry. well documented history discrimination ethical failure way health care medical research treats people color, poor folks, women, prisoners, etc. would say one thing missing conversation intersection race/ethnicity class. kind hinted use ""educational level,"" think case education poor substitute class. legitimate mistrust medicine (due historical mistreatment) underlies Black Latino resistance vaccines probably plays role lower income working class white resistance. pulling mistrust medicine apart influence political commitments (Republicanism) vaccine misinformation (from left right political spectrum) among lower income White folks difficult. ""Doing research"" new go-to euphemism whenever nature calls.


Hold on, I've got another one-liner.


Aaron Rodgers called ""thinker"" many people, lisp. Kids 4 exist unprotected. yes, want protection children returning normal. almost makes sense somewhere range half unvaccinated Americans exposure Covid-19 six months ago. people never knew Covid-19 (mild cases) likely higher experts estimated.  relevant see metric protection severe outcomes. Otherwise means little. remember UK registered high % well, Delta ravaged them. terms containment already know thing matters right high antibody count is, whether some. truly endemic anywhere world nearly infections still naive adult hosts. means individual severity still high specific age bracket. True endemic hosts exposed unvaccinated kindergartners reinfections available hosts.   really appreciate comment. I've changed anything fundamentally, even gotten booster. sometimes feel like I'm crazy people acting like over. New cases Canada today: 998.

New cases Vienna today: 1,200.

In Austria today: 10,363 counting. Every single day past 10 days 10,000.

It's ridiculous. walked downtown Vienna yesterday evening restaurants full, nobody streets wearing mask. hospitals going overwhelmed soon, though apparently there's still room ICUs many dying. overwhelming majority adults* people, i.e. children included. Also, Delta variant's high rate transmissability would need higher % previously estimated reach herd immunity,   Get third dose stop worrying. understanding even tho vaccinated % may well high CA...california's population damn high almost 10million people arent vaxxed. 

10 million lotta folks. 

(Michigan 10th populated state 9.9 million....40 states 50 populations leas unvaccinated population California) 


is much concern? I'm vaccinated boosted still wear mask around. point think shows form social responsibility, regardless youre vaccinated, mandated not. person walking could become uncomfortable public since pandemic started, immuno-compromised, whatever reason, succeptable virus average person whether know not. Continuing something already past year shouldnt take much effort likely appreciated others. first person call boycott probate lawyer hoping Mrs. Claus becomes widow soon. Santa *huge* toy empire he's leaving behind! Obviously. FDA completely screwed pooch messaging regarding boosters. likely Japanese OP posts Japanese article Japanese achievement... Darn Americans! Lmao 0.00013% 2020 income. must really burning hole pockets hope satire. gave name ""Tesco"" without context, first guess would gas station. Second guess would supermarket. never shortage US, it?  Archive.is usually good job punching paywalls - here's link full article: http://archive.today/5JLmC I'm also wondering race this. read poster needlessly brings race it. MN mask mandate. said multiple times vaccinated safe mask. sure try make sort racist... Guess that's state things days. Aaron went Pat's podcast, said felt personal opinions matter. personally sees it, told people, ""don't listen me, base care did, instead talk doctor, best you. I'm sorry, get said, comprehension level low, imo. also decide one day, ""hey, know what's best better everyone."" anti vaccine/vaccination, broad sense word. past, way Covid-19 even thing, Aaron lightly discussed pretty intense allergies, different things. 

You acting like Aaron Rodgers wanted openly discuss push anti vaccination agenda beginning. didn't. doesn't. come beginning say vaccinated give personal reasons coming decision. knew least speculated, everyone else attacked him, would exactly doing. Every single time anyone belittles him, gets mad him, proving initial speculation, true. enforcing feelings topic.

Let ask this. look vaccines prior taking them? get vaccinated without weighing possible risk? I'm clear. I'm pro vaccine. I've voluntarily getting flu vaccine every year past 22 years. mRNA vaccines came out, excited get vaccinated Covid. also look different studies, consulted, doctor, also friends epidemiology field, better understand science behind them, better weigh risks getting vaccinated versus getting vaccinated getting Covid. looking personal risks, risk associated others, due working hospital, decided willing risk low chance negative side effects getting one mRNA vaccines, got vaccinated. unlike Aaron Rodgers, people, majority people, minority people, I've history allergic ingredients vaccines. certainly made decision get vaccinated Covid much easier.

Humans, whole, extremely similar, biologically speaking, pretty much every human planet, fact different interactions different compounds/elements. people completely allergy free, others highly allergic slew things. family members friends can't handle peanuts latex. hand love good pb&amp;j, issue wearing certain gloves eating bananas. humans, effected different things, differently. inability accept truth, short coming yours, many humans there.

And like the, ""right,"" share disagreement Aaron Rodgers' opinions, understanding position matter. right opinions, right voice understanding believe came opinions.

Have great day. verification NYC already. use cards well apps. show app, also show ID prove name matches.  I'm confused exactly people missing point honest. admit can't read article English, going good ol' ""I read title"", point exactly title suggests. nothing masking.

It seems introducing another reason Japan low case counts, that's fine. regard masking, actual science masking really really difficult nail down. super hot button topic, see completely mixed discussion scientific subs like /r/COVID19 example. angry mob comes downvote hammer, mask times, everywhere. think scientists agree masking important NPI, find single one says even remotely level vaccination. smallest country Europe Cyprus 12 times size Singapore... 

Beside, pretty obvious people refer main European countries, compare Singapore, talking tiny fiscal paradises developing countries like Azerbaijan... Kaiser poll shows basically thing. clear majority (65%) Democrats indicated received definitely receive flu shot. 40% Republicans indicated would. 

Flu shot uptake 25 point partisan divide (68% vs 44%, different poll, results) like Covid vaccines.

In February 2020, divide 4 points. 58% vs 54%, negligible. 2016 nearly identical, 55% vs 53%. Okay vaccine demand low. enough expired demand went up. causing mass shortage. So...where it? provided evidence such. fear mongering problem. click links send dashboard? They‚Äôre nearly laggy deaths, behind days recall correctly wonder percentage eligible voters passed away Republican voters. Based demographics correlations healthcare education quality affect COVID outcomes. age alone points majority R voters among dead. Even flip districts, certainly accelerates inevitable emergence larger, younger block voters want nothing American right. Exactly. Vermont New York everyone 18 get one, New Hampshire work certain job certain illness? CDC came couple weeks ago saying anyone form mental illness like depression anxiety qualifies booster, doctors office pharmacies haven‚Äôt added list. went ahead checked condition, according CDC. Sooo prefer? treatments? Fact is, big Pharma way ever make effective drugs. New drugs cost millions develop, test release. Giving selective information way anybody conveys information ever. Heres example: Tom Brady greatest quarterback ever play NFL, proof hes 6 super bowls. see there? left fact also LOST 4 super bowls, didnt help make truth clear people. truth hes great QB, yet leave truthful, misleading, information order convey know truth be

And, course, statistician, losing four Super Bowls actually helps case, since means led team finished 2nd place years. Losing Super Bowl better going all.

Natasha Frost newsletter writer Europe Edition Morning Briefing. @natashamfrost moment stopped listening them. awful, awful decision. I'd say vaccine choosing safety features installed car. unvaccinated driving around without seatbelt even installed. get accident, still result actions - maybe forgot seatbelt, decided take crazy crowded highway - person safety features installed far likely survive escape less injury.

Car insurance would like healthcare system itself. Public healthcare (focused prevention risk management) tells get safety features installed acute healthcare systems (focused repair recovery indicent occurs) much work likely cost less use needed. couple dozen European countries smaller populations that.

The entire premise vaccine equity nonsense begin with. somewhat relevant discussion boosters first came June back production still bottleneck, time decision made September moot point. Distribution become bottleneck vaccines, production. posted length month ago, even true today last month. Global doses administered risen significantly past month *because* boosters administered EU, US, large developed countries. 

In past several weeks, crossed milestone: half world's adult (18+) population already fully vaccinated. Every incremental percent vaccination point become incrementally harder; example, US peaked vaccine administration long reached 50% eligible population fully vaccinated. 

As much likes pretend world waiting sleeves rolled shot, reality not. large countries still supply bottlenecks, especially second dose delivery, exception rule.

If fine was, say 5 billion dollars Amazon would maybe give shit.  Exactly. know people clearly eligible sure they're eligible they're waiting. need clarify want booster go get one. vast majority antivaxxers Michigan black Hispanic?

Uh no. Roughly half white Michigan residents yet vaccinated least one dose (assuming meant antivaxxers.) Hispanics also roughly half negligible purposes proving wrong. 62% black MI residents yet vaccinated, however percentage total state population, white residents account \~75% population black residents account 14%, (with hispanics \~5%.) 

I'll walk math since apparently bothered prior making hilariously false assumption ""vast majority"" antivaxxers black Hispanic (which apparently monolithic can't possibly support trump according you.)

.5 x 75 = 37.5% state population white antivaxxers. 

.62 x 15 = 9.3% state population black antivaxxers.

Technically, according states dashboard, 25% reporting vaccine coverage list race quite correct list percentage total population, really affect proportional make yet vaccinated point still stands: **The vast majority anti-vaxxers Michigan black hispanic, white.** yes, disproportionally self-identify republicans according KFF. Germany's current wave looks like wall infinitely scaling wave, sort like India's wave back May. plus side, deaths ramped nearly fast still great sign. Especially consider Germany like 67% fully vaxxed low Covid exposure overall. I'm aware that, make society less wrong subject. Yeah...

Not vaccine per se, end everyday stress worrying. know got first shot, especially got second shot felt relieved end dangerous time finally year+ worrying going die get real sick leave kids behind.

NYC don‚Äôt wear masks indoors (except health care, schools transit) prove vaccinated. Unvaccinated people can‚Äôt even go in, even wearing masks.

It sounds like DC dropping mask mandates (except healthcare, schools, transit, businesses require masks) without instituting vaccine required protocol.  billionaire puts $20 bill charity bin way Hamptons it‚Äôs also win/win, right? essence Pfizer arrangement. important takeaway ""87 89 infected residents staff fully vaccinated"" part? Fully vaccinated... 98% infection rate. 

What ridiculous statement make information total number residents staff facility.   Better late never guess, happened weeks ago. never heard anything this... never thought austrian cousins stupid. makes sense. imagine couldn't? sort hillbilly ragtag militia.  would add kids 12 well. two received first doses next week. work home, wife sometimes works school there's noticeable uptick cases area (suburb NJ 15 miles outside Manhattan). 

We're eight months 2nd dose... per CDC, perhaps *shouldn't* get booster thus taking chance getting kids, maybe giving someone else's kids get screw delicate period kids three weeks second shot? 

I mean... really, thought left ""qualifying"" behind walls known Delta drastically slower vaccine uptick. damn absurd needlessly complicated...

The results far seem show booster original vaccine working well, possibly well updated one is. difference effectiveness may significant enough switch.

Another point article raises manufacturing still challenge, switching manufacturing could cause interruptions reduce output, could cause problems updated vaccine would solve.

It's still good thing it, since results could gone way, that's studies.   Shovelling snow always stop mine. flu shot Pfizer booster October cycle skipped itself. 

I personally feel like motivation behind collecting data COVID deaths pressing matter minds involved testing process. also wonder hands may tied they're permitted funds federally assigned them. implying there‚Äôs something wrong arrangement? Seems like win win. Masks help flu colds though, too? Please note- saying mandate anything. However, someone wants wear mask cold flu even better SPREADING cold flu- power them!

Masks easy wear means catching flu winter, trade easily worth imho, flu SUCKS! people boostered like been.

Probably getting mine there‚Äôs sort roadmap lifting restrictions. worth day two sickness I‚Äôm gonna inside day everyday anyway shows vaccine 98% effective!!!"" stuff see daily.

You see daily, certainly seen often since Delta became prominent, absolutely see mentioned regards high risk patients (like elderly immunocompromised).

But means, get stats wrong - 67 89 infected, 56 high risk elderly people recovered.

So comes severe disease death - 1 67 died, 97% effective. probably 5 cent fine scale income over-time working entry-level employees. seems hit everyone differently. I've heard people saying wiped next day people feel anything. FWIW, wife got flu shots time side effects sore arms.

The first shot made sleepy next day, nothing second shot booster. rough time 2nd shot. booster nothing sore arm. I'll check get home, I'm mobile   Eh, think add ""overwhelming"" qualifier considering good chance numbers skewed. Without lot analysis, think saying simple majority pretty safe.

We definitely ""overwhelming"" phase right now, vaccination rates. people decided getting infected easy way. Fortunately true. wrong, they're gonna feel pretty stupid. literally got booster Pfizer CVS yesterday. looking qualifications CDC's website, absurd qualifications are. Like anxiety depression? qualifies probably 50% population lol

Just let anyone everyone wants within timeframe needing get it. going see breakthrough case city holidays decision. could hammering boosters left right seriously curb it. said immunity. mean reliant vaccines forever more. long protection symptomatic infection booster last though? 28 days? What's point? Add aren‚Äôt reopening convenient mass vaccination centers time around. saw friend post couldn‚Äôt find vaccination openings til December 18th Looks like Germany 0.6% CFR - much better US drastically worse European countries (like UK's &lt;0.2%). That's generally determined demographic spread vaccinations.

But deaths actually increasing faster cases. Cases risen 4-fold deaths already done well even though nearly 4-fold case increase recent killed people yet. CFR may rising (which expected cases rise). Another possibility though Germany really fast reporting deaths.

The question end NPI's additional vaccinations. Germany must among lowest immunity rates country world point, worst case could still really bad.  generally 17 donate blood

You also need person chooses donate blood, self-selecting. can't take numbers apply across whole population. People Covid may likely donate blood, knowing bad is.

I'm getting Moderna booster hour, awesome! seen anything side effects booster shot posted around. pretty rough day second shot (chills full body aches), expect similar day tomorrow what? booster easier, rougher, second shot?

Don't really care much tomorrow work want shot, would nice know expect. see there, OP indeed antivax Japan.

However, compliance comes much antivaxness Japan.

But course, main reason sluggish implementation Japan Japan. tons red tape insist procedures correctly designed implemented.  Boosters already helped percentage vaccinated hospitalized drop 5% area (down 30%). essential boost ease hospitalization numbers. CDC took stance weak assumed open less criticism already we're feeling effects continued underwhelming response. Maybe watch video? problem everyone able connect equally. thread dumpster fire. many people using caricature they've created head infer people *like them* donate blood, *other types* people don't. Good lord simplistic, self-aggrandizing logic. wish could read this. I‚Äôm subscribing Atlantic though. OK, we'll need boosters, big deal. Well, cases declining steadily last couple weeks, seems could start upward trend. I'm hoping right though. you‚Äôre expecting folks mask every cold/flu season? That‚Äôs asinine. Define ‚Äúease up‚Äù.  Granted I‚Äôm big crowds sort person anyway I‚Äôve back mostly normal things since fully vaccinated end April. lot patients claim ""flu symptoms.""

it's 7 months since 2nd modern, much protection still have? another repeat things opening up, closing 3 months. know governor trying win abandoning mitigation efforts. People supported actions early pandemic frustrated. People never vote matter what.

Seems politically stupid. Pleases nobody. get CVS something. check eligibility anyone asks (which shouldnt anyways) say diagnosed depression therefor eligible know many days twice daily regimen taken for? Pretty sure Merck‚Äôs 5 days. Safe assume around range? Japan better countries? Considering cramped conditions Japanese cities, would expected greater problems.

If idiots want fuck around Covid let suffer consequences actions. hospital resources become scarce, put unvaccinated bottom triage priority list. Seems like terrible idea 3rd shot modern bad? 2nd shot kicked ass pretty good  Probably. thing. Yes almost certainly do. sure go advisory panel mumbo jumbo commissioner it. Hopefully latter. pulled daughter kindergarten West Oakland County get 2nd Pfizer shot. area worst numbers county according county dashboard everyone around acts like over. literally masked person packed store day. holidays coming numbers already high think we're rough time.  Great timing...

Are seriously dumb? done US yet, probably FDA even granted authorization 12-17. mask mandates, even vaccination requirements place (not people lie this) make sense, especially holiday season approaches

Colorado here.  ""libertarian-democrat"" governor /u/jaredpolis never backed mask mandates, even elementary schools. Kicked road local ordinance sicced crazies/Q-berts local school boards uncomfortable political conversations. case rate insane right - worse last year, pre vaccine, time. deaths higher right last November, that's really saying something. 

Even though vaccination rate US average, hospitals over-full statewide.  We've moved ""crisis"" level care, elective surgeries cancelled, healthcare workers burnt crisp--- we're starting whole holiday indoor gathering cycle.

Failure mask stage pandemic leads bad place. Pfizer's logo looks like could good cola brand check out. even young people recommended get booster timely manner rejected safeguards even make 1st dose, situation really relevant people taken three shots. rejecting science simply hope point, either vaccines effective longer, anti-virals proven effective long-term, and/or majority humans become immune repeated infection, vaxxed not.

I'll going personally every 6 months know necessary, terrible reaction them, booster worst felt three. Obviously, would nice get point yearly shots would that's needed.  Oh cool, thanks info! 

It‚Äôll good GF too, she‚Äôs super anxious knowing vaccine still effective despite booster help calm bit! seems part unresolved issue durable COVID vaccination hypothesis virus replicates quickly respiratory cells body produce antibodies learned quickly enough prevent massive inflammation (which leads pneumonia, etc). thesis right, really see get around problem right without periodically stimulating immune system produce antibodies, unfortunately. least issue effectively undivided attention medical community, though. course. It‚Äôs completely design.  welcome. Happy boosting. =) 1) 12-19 days read, upvote jdorje's answer yesterday: 65 immunocompromised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection deaths among US veterans 2021 30 pills taken 5 days. 20 Paxlovid 10 ritonavir HIV drug. bullshit. Fun fact: Nobody going stop you. Nobody screening patients going ""Hmmm, see documentation saying eligible"". excess shots people giving shots wants give many shots possible. walked right vaccination site, said ""Yeah, Pfizer booster"" got it. asked eligibility all. 

Guess experience may vary depending location. live small southern town, demand pretty low assume. I‚Äôm guessing misstatement misquote intended word ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù instead pandemic. words facility scheduled booster doses November 2nd outbreak began late September ongoing November 2nd forced cancellation boosters.

In article state booster event rescheduled new cases 2 weeks. time holidays! been, nearly 2 years. I'm exhausted. kid never seen inside store. They've seen grandparents handful times person, wear masks everywhere go try socially distance much possible. I'm sick worrying I'm bringing COVID home run errand. worry going get worse people can't bothered wear mask indoors anymore got theirs. 3 zeros 500,000 500,000,000. agree I'd like 4+, $500M fines definitely enough get take notice. two things say that, first hundred thousands people vaccinated like without signals popping secondly hours mrna gone system, remains immune systems response. 
generally speaking long term side effects thing vaccines. side effects occur weeks shot. wanna look studies try search r/covid19 search heterologous dont top mind^ ^ companies got booster, told got second shot full immunization wouldn‚Äôt occur another two weeks five take. similar period booster shot?

Also got second shot end April, weakened original vaccine become? plenty people still wearing masks indoors well NYC. I'll keep long still feel like alive. article Tedros don‚Äôt want read. Thanks! Thank you! Touch√©. Yes, heaven forbid health care workers actually take precautions less likely transmit illnesses people they're supposed help get better, decrease chances getting sick health care system collapse workers sick. would want thing, right? 500,000?

I would note CDC require conditions diagnosed qualify. CDC guidelines learning COVID-19 every day, list include medical conditions place person higher risk severe illness COVID-19.   health mood disorders, *including* depression

(I personally read CDC compiled comprehensive list mood disorders qualify, even comprehensive list *conditions* qualify)

and CDC provided outlink experiencing following signs symptoms day, nearly every day, least two weeks, may suffering Persistent sad, anxious, ‚Äúempty‚Äù  everyone depressed experiences every symptom. people experience symptoms

Other things keep current **or former** cigarette smoker

What ""former"" smoker? CDC purposefully define this.

These qualifiers written *extremely* broadly.

I believe person argue qualify based this, qualify; lying.

Just opinion... thats like half hour profit rivian holding It‚Äôs true vaccinated doesn‚Äôt stop spread. Vaccinated people much less likely get infected infected contagious much shorter period time.

A lot places people wear masks too. [Unvaccinated boy nearly died tetanus. cost care almost $1 Oh know seems like there's least another 30% population could get vaccinated.

A large part problem stupid portion population actually follow recommended even required solution. know they're statistics reliable. numbers put propaganda. estimate based measures take. TIL kids 5 people. I'm guessing lot jobs, like nurses, waiter, cashier you, pay often exactly great, people would likely want make extra bucks donating blood? 

I mean strapped cash could make money donating blood (and actually eligible so, since received blood transfusion 1985 apparently makes sort biological weapon), I'd consider sure! We‚Äôve passed target. NYT says EUA unvaccinated people now. 3? guess really boils greater acceptance masks. wondered masks effective crowded public transport people squeezed together. go supermarket, fortunately everybody wear masks, still try distance people I'm convinced wear masks properly. Canada 75%+ Yes. actually happy drugs,

Antidepressants put mood 4/10.

When depressed 2/10 good.

If regular 7/10 person sucks.

Also come host side effects weight gain, erectile dysfunction, numbness hypo/hypersomni + long term damage taking prescription drugs extended time. Sure lots places say ""masks optional vaccinated"" nobody checks, think antivaxxers going put mask walk in? Smithers, wallet's right front pocket. Seems like Biontech licensed multiple manufacturers instead Pfizer. district longer quarantine students exposure. They‚Äôre trying make health department handle quarantines, also report infections week.  Trumpenfear. Actually Alberta almost tied Ontario, Ontario 2% highest outside Maritime provinces territories. Alberta's makes sense, think current WFH situation means we're even footing terms meeting quality.

It win-win situation That‚Äôs like someone making $50k needing pay $6.50 fine‚Ä¶?! math right? read article. think issues highlighted overblown could easily resolved companies really wanted to. Got Pfizer 3rd yesterday, 100% normal today getting rekt earlier two clear hundred cases lead 10k+... Greed  Yeah like automatic option would change get flu shot it. Weird different experience. Maybe technical bug. questions answered deal excludes large countries suffered devastating coronavirus outbreaks. example, Brazilian drug company could get license make pill export countries, medicine could made generically use Brazil. Doctors Without Borders said ‚Äúdisheartened‚Äù Pfizer deal make drug available entire world, noting agreement announced Tuesday also excludes countries including China, Argentina Thailand. 

I guess 95 countries get might even poorer Brazil Argentina. I've back handful days. Mostly due power outages home.

But HORRIBLE. I'm completly discombobulated utter destruction routine. 

That said get hate video calls people seem have. Nore see ""zoom office"" solution bad.

I left WFH position years pandemic. one 100% WFH, office. Large meetings NIGHTMARE us remote workers, speakerphone really pick going on. everyone equalized call, still feel like I'm equal player. fear enough people going back office &amp; making us stay remote second class citizens again. something I'll never get. Wearing mask, especially customer, trivial inconvenience proven prevent spread disease. vaccinated saves lives, prevent spread. One substitute other. Immune compromised individuals can't rely herd immunity enough people vaccinated, containing spread wearing masks indoors still help them. top vaccines 100% effective. add enough unvaccinated still risk overflowing ICU capacity big surge.

Removing mask mandates, even vaccination requirements place (not people lie this) make sense, especially holiday season approaches. Looking possible answer hold hour clinic...

I booster shot scheduled tomorrow UTI came back. anyone know wait get UTI control get booster since immune system already activated? thinking even worse response Moderna shot due infection. 

I really want booster! actual recommendation *when* get booster? It‚Äôs 8 months since got vaccinated.   reasons come mind:

- CCP leadership can't agree change policy,

- populist pressure political leaders win next election democratic countries,

- China tried show system superior democratic systems stamping Covid. Giving zero-Covid policy would destroy narrative,

- low infection rate means low immunity need higher vaccination rate,

- Chinese economy depend foreign tourists like Western countries. Business contacts goods trade managed electronically time. Really ? tried both, Walgreens kept prompting schedule separately CVS drop menu vaccines could schedule appointment‚Ä¶ worked regard. cool man good luck thanks, would love hear updates any. good day case I‚Äôd rather burning house misery burning house I'm nervous getting third shot, anyone tell vs second shot? felt like straight ass second shot keep hearing worse third time around. still wanna get it. NYC don‚Äôt wear masks indoors (except health care, schools transit)

Someone correct I'm wrong Maryland (maybe Maryland, IDK counties) policy without proof vaccination. people mask, don't. Mainly depends county/region. Relatively highly vaccinated state pretty well.

I think lot people put much stock masks do, say someone still masks everywhere. Masks NPI alone going shape course pandemic. cherry top. Hence make sense (unless consensus population) mandate NPI perpetually. sounds like it‚Äôs good news (Democrats likely get flu shots) bad news (Republicans less likely get flu shots).

Or we‚Äôre seeing changing partisan identity: get flu shots increasingly identifying Democrats don‚Äôt Republicans. Really? heard effective one dose getting one soap company. sorry hear situation there. Germany, summer low cases, upcoming election, restrictions eased

This happened even though scientists could tell vaxx rates low we'd head exactly disaster find right now.

I've seen people say Walgreens acting similarly CVS.  Reporting specific side argument activism, journalism.

You might say ""bUt hE's jOuRnAlIsT,"" he's done past decade journalistic 90% see ""real"" news media.  Boom.

Went pick allergy medication last week. Sweet talked pharmacist giving booster shot. He‚Äôs dumb jock, he‚Äôs smarter poster abo

How could possibly quantify that? Fear needles one thing. I'm disagreeing reasons wanting vaccine - whatever - automatically implies less likely something good like donating blood. know plenty people want vaccines plenty charity community work Lol yea mentioning banned FDA consumption probably given people brilliant ideas. Well said, black white thinking fallacy many us hold to. Many view points true fail properly analyze risk (I‚Äôm ‚Äúyoung‚Äù healthy, even got I‚Äôll fine; vaccine rare rate side effects, I‚Äôd rather take chances virus).

I look vaccine insurance. You‚Äôre necessarily protecting fender bender parking lot. You‚Äôre protecting bone collusion tree falling car storm. Maybe seat belt airbag would better.   implying anything related vaccine hesitancy statement. remembered articles Olympics low compared highly developed countries great see high relatively short time however got there!   Here's thing, Aaron actually went type doctors/surgeons inquiring risks taking J&amp;J vaccine. vaccine could take, since he's allergic 2 4 ingredients, mRNA vaccines, experts, including CDC, say allergy even one means, take mRNA vaccines. either specialists convince risk adverse reaction J&amp;J vaccine super low, saw reports blood clotting, simply decided risk, was, ""too much."" fair, blood clots, even manageable regular people, harder manage top athletes. Especially, play high contact sports.

I wish people would let go. world sports media, blew way proportion, misled interview. course, NFL insiders knew truth moment said, ""I'm immunized,"" decided keep themselves. Oddly enough, deciding wait tested positive. 

And timing reporting matter, may ask? Well, insiders, clearly give shit pressers unmasked. could been? Hmm? Know something, basically stopped hearing about? Gruden/WFT scandal. scandal, NFL insiders discussing reported, Owner Washington Football Team. Interesting coincidence, right? also completely eclipsed guy Vegas driving 156 killing woman, intoxicated.

The sports media world always, ""used,"" Rodgers punching bag, great getting clicks/ad revenue. spent years saying nothing, keeping personal thoughts wide range topics himself. media, basically made shit up, assuming motives/feelings, reporting assumptions. assumptions people either related him, past teammates. Rodgers met Pat McAfee, became friends, started podcast every Tuesday, football season. seemingly, pissed sports media talking heads, even more. now, even though Rodgers shares thoughts public, using Pat's podcast, talking heads still take says, continue make endless assumptions. long history media making assumptions him, led make whole, ""woke mob,"" quote. not, opinion impact voting behavior mortality rate low, think mortality rate big impact factor influences voting behavior. saw mentioned Ben Shapiro. case know, Ben Shapiro grifter hack. find anything he's said compelling, keep mind also says things like nobody seems willing state obvious due cultural sensitivity...

If want smart NFL players take pandemic - talk Fitzpatrick. got fucking 48 (out 50) wonderlic graduated Harvard.
(Not Ben Shapiro Harvaaaard though people!) Yeah take high dose pill I‚Äôve bleeding problems massive headache led finding danger stroke. I‚Äôm getting booster IUD everything kinda stable. I‚Äôve got lot friends period missed second shot.  certainly isn‚Äôt unvaccinated right now. think breakthrough cases climbing. 

But yeah, that‚Äôs point he‚Äôs making. 

I tried checking pressing ‚Äúpost‚Äù, think numbers breakthroughs straightforward. Comparing rates unvaccinated vaccinated misleading vaccinated population vaccinated different times different initial risk. breakthroughs happening. got booster yesterday CVS. asked immunocompromised, think determine would get full third dose versus booster. Also asked see vaccine card. brought hospital badge need show it.   sounds like letting perfect enemy good. Obviously perfect objectivity impossible would require omniscience. One journalist limited perspective, still report events see without injecting personal beliefs. rocket science. I've incredibly lucky One week protect yourself, two weeks see drop positive tests/contagiousness infected first week. purposes public health second one matters.

[Antibody levels second test rate third American, something comforting knowing one deal many idiots home nation.... also absolutely terrifying. one diminishing anything irrelevant point made. People long COVID still vote.  vastly underestimating many people won‚Äôt get vaccine fear needles. far know blood bank uses needles too.   I'm getting vaxxed stuff, left need stop acting like everyone vaccine going 1. Catch Covid 2. Die/be hospitalized catch it.

Remember way back start pandemic fight ""wear mask, people catch Covid even major symptoms might even know still spreading it"".

That changed. people (who younger moderately decent health) going fine catch it. keep beating chests screaming ""YOU'RE 10X LIKELY HOSPITALIZED!"" people aware fact probably going big deal catch shake heads us. makes take even less seriously view overblown.

We really focus end pandemic quicker everyone gets vaxed betterment one's community reduce spread.

Because anti vaxers bad people. see value helping neighbor's. dig heels roll eyes act like gonna die get vaccine.

10x likely low starting point huge number. Yeah. understand saying, get educated people can't see thru bs. Like think government always best interest heart? No. think there's hidden Illuminati agenda behind covid getting us vaccinated? Nope. Sometimes bad shit really happens society individual part keep society functioning. NYTimes vaccination rates, fully vaccinated around 70% population least age.

Sounds like Covid still lot unvaccinated burn through. Give ol' Kapernick treatment distribution shortage, supply shortage. sending millions doses incredibly slow scale vaccination sites. I'm Northern California. Used reside 20ish miles away Rodgers's home town Chico. He's done much good work Northern California field. completely messed everything he's embarrassed past couple weeks asinine anti-vaccine nonsense. used favorite player 49ers, he's ""Throw Rogan"" me. mean poster called dumb jock. He‚Äôs dumb jock, he‚Äôs smarter poster above. anyone explain determine rate among vaccinated? know sure people still contract covid vaccination, seems like experience less symptoms vaccination (and think mostly immune) WAY less likely get tested. 

So absent regular testing, know unvaccinated five times likely contract disease non vaccinated? 

I‚Äôve wondering while.  Probably way get rid immunity go high-dose chemotherapy.   Dumb YouTube videos? american either, getting enlisted transplants hard due shortage organs.

Assuming one rich, put waiting lists, course alcoholics needing new livera even accepted, they'd destroy it.
Instead give people could decent life it.

It sucks, due shortage. wouldnt fair need without faults, die dude decided drinking liver oblivion good idea, since transplants free all...

As always cannot save all, forced make choice, blame willing mask social distance (or getting vaccine) this, doctors. haven‚Äôt heard one. I‚Äôll keep eye news that. News channels aren‚Äôt news channels advertisement channels.

They put whatever bullshit draws media attention sell like hot cakes ad retinue supply shortage,not vaccine hesistancy. supply came vaccination rate rose really fast.  /s may forgotten Thank much protecting child. good hear story, seeing accounts many people taking opposite route. Many times children wind paying parents' misinformed decisions. Brava. lie? 5x likely means still able to?  good interview personal life tried touch rift family years ago can‚Äôt dig Google Covid controversy . let‚Äôs go we‚Äôve got here.

A lot Aaron‚Äôs original central argument original interview deeper understanding (like 500 page paper NFL), deserves special treatment, didn‚Äôt anything wrong, wants accept understanding.

Aaron obviously isn‚Äôt running cult compare Steve Hassan‚Äôs BITE model. watch old LaRouche video. asked question instead answering 
Proceeds give bunch unverifiable stuff couldn‚Äôt fact check fly counts like knows he‚Äôs talking about. controls narriative.

Certainly science.  gets medical advice podcaster. little bit ago shockingly low? Great progress! osteopath - detox bath probably go advice. 

Deluded struck professional licensing body. Yeah we're looking it, people dying like ours... 

Not going lie, really wonder social media platforms much less influenced pandemic would US. People could still text absorbing antivax rhetoric platforms display it. Aaron Rodgers extremely intelligent  double negative   you‚Äôre freaking stupid suspended season? deserve QB team.     think failure think margin. nothing people, instead incremental costs benefits. He's self proclaimed ""free thinker"" LOL 20000 deaths country 120000000 people. 14.51 deaths per 100000 people. donated blood 10 times going on. 

The people donate over. think lack education. Look many nurses medical professionals refusing vaccine. Sure minority still way many. think propaganda really easy use people. Feed people's fears, tell want hear boom, schooling goes right window. credit highschool science classes making much easier take premeds get A's. pay attention school loved science, I'm sure helped well. Nothing, long people claim something doesn't. Cheese replaced brain had. need create bath salt product, natural ingredients, vaccine cleanser.
Hymalaian salt essential oils maybe, ionized therapeutic crystal, secret ingredient like sulfur known cleansing properties.

Or go example. teacher checks homework one person every day, lot people get without teacher noticing it. means fine it. Yes, take bath B L E C H. context that? seems weirdly phrased. smallpox vaccine first vaccine ever available. course people embraced opposed it. embraced ""saw miracle queued hours"", others didn't.

I.e. evidence mandate actually induced fueled skepticism? still need know cases hospitalization/death. Hospitalization thing spreads person person. kid's school 0 people hospitalized Covid, tell much knowing half 2nd grade including teachers tested positive? antivax family wouldn‚Äôt even give dog heartworm meds.

You know they'd horse dewormer COVID, though. Idk know certain health circles advocate drinking borax water too. prob would honestly. It‚Äôs... bizarre. quarantined 21 days, 10 days England! sucks, sorry. reaction vaccine booster. think people reactions bring up. Israel seen several severe cases under-60s third dose, although number 20+ times lower 2-dose vaccinated. immune system perfect.  past smallpox vaccination mandatory

And start anti-vax movement. vaccines seen miracles people would queue hours get. Netherlands small ICU capacity due frequent use euthanasia hospice care. simply cannot let restrictions go without overflowing healthcare sector. Training ICU personnel takes years unfortunately. would surprised need bring nurses elsewhere EU aren‚Äôt already legitimate Delete System 32. That‚Äôs true, vaccination rate could better. Moreover scientists Germany developed one best vaccines world actually effective mix match vaccine types. specifically chose moderna even though j j available order mix them. actual efficacy numbers anything point. best real-world comparison showing positive tests hospitalizations happening certain rate, highly confounded different demographics vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

We know phase 1's J&amp;J initial dose + Pfizer booster least good, probably better than, two-dose pfizer regimen. regimen gives 80%+ initial-but-waning efficacy infection ~90% efficacy-that-doesn't-wane hospitalization infected. know want third dose point, recent dose definitely good shape transmitting Delta far better shape getting severely ill it. I'm surprised. Despite dumb partisan stuff start year, Canadian federal government pretty much knocked park comes vaccines. *most* Canadians didnt hesitate get them. flu brutal. get flu shot every year still contract flu every years. last time it, majority worst symptoms gone within 2-3 days (my fever broke 36 hours), back normal probably close month. country actually started giving out? know authorized Mercks seeing anyplace actually started prescribing see real use data know anyone infection. anecdote wins, right? üòâ Yeah, seems misinformation. posted before.

The study video says Clinical studies indicated patients severe COVID‚Äì19 exhibit delayed weak adaptive immune responses; however, mechanism SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, using vitro cell line, report SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, required effective V(D)J recombination adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, found spike protein localizes nucleus inhibits DNA damage repair impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 53BP1 recruitment damage site.

So, rather people severe Covid, vaccines protect against, bashing mrna vaccines. jump conclusion seems disingenious. Furthermore seem problems study, link recommend reading comment starting TL;DR - findings questionable physiological relevance since use completely irrelevant cell line (kidney cells), rather using lymphocyte progenitors (immune cells actually engage VDJ recombination) airway cell lines. get second booster lol üòÜ Yes, last longer. body keeps blueprints billions antibodies file every pathogen ever encountered allocate resources them. one done encounter never body ramp production ones sees once, however body recognizes something seen knows persistent threat makes extra antibodies stick around longer. boosters seem work better since original shot. clicking link contributed ad money toward death Americans.

there pfizer+ pfizer booster numbers get that. less twice many vaccinated unvaccinated Germany roughly 65% fully vaccinated. Even less, number include ones eligible yet. 

That would imply, risk vaccinated transmission best half low unvaccinated person. can't right numbers seen Baden W√ºrttemberg shared government last week (they stopped reporting split incidences vaccinated unvaccinated people). roughly 10% incidence unvaccinated people.

The sense make twice many vaccinated people also infect unvaccinated people, 10 times higher rates getting disease. again, problem vaccinated, nearly twice many vaccine. people keep thinking monopoly US.  Nope, crazies everywhere. great way get people get vaccinated. ""Get jab, get certificate detox away $100 bath."" Start defining ""the pandemic"" work there. Create criteria calling ""ended.""

Whatever end with, vaccine number one largest contributor towards ""ending"" pandemic, ultimately means Covid still exists spreading around world rapidly. vaccine reduces odds infection speeds recovery times, critical metrics. that‚Äôs exactly point, people vaccinated, especially young people practically zero risk bearing brunt suffering continuing ‚Äúcovid world‚Äù restrictions. Lives businesses destroyed, people missing years high school college. Schools 100% vax rate still requiring nonstop, it‚Äôs madness.

Says who?
 know things changing everyday, right?
 house fire say ""if go back we'll never go back in"" instead letting firefighters put fire? HK also tries implement zero covid strategy. I'd say many things strict quarantine upon entering mass testing contact tracing helped. one (third) dose. mRNA vectored inactivated, difference degree. Uruguay ended pandemic 2 doses inactivated third dose mostly pfizer; know vaccines highly effective multiple doses spread long enough. thought issue shortage, need verify safe everyone qualify. Yes, absolutely take hint asian countries wear masks cold flu season basic courtesy think there's chance we've exposed could carrier cold flu well. Ideally we'd quarantine stay home, sometimes option. mask always is. MIS-C exceedingly rare. hybrid model mainly companies could remote C-Suite misses full buildings people cater them. want conference room full Hands meetings catered lunches. 

Like company wants go hybrid require masks/6 feet social distancing. point even go back, safe without precautions might well stay remote avoid adding extra covid anxiety onto employees. Fair enough. I'm saying children lick doorknobs, overall point suspect many unable conduct level-headed risk assessment based data statistics small part Germany tightening rules. one currently hardest hit (surprise surprise everything largest city vaccination rate 50%). rest Germany still hesitating. politicians promised, now, high vaccination rates (science side note: high, low), need restrictions more... two months ago. forced back-pedal numbers exploding almost country. politicians trying find way safe face blame someone else bad decisions. probably discuss another couple days, numbers climb even higher better justification restrictions, like half year ago, necessary again. &amp;#x200B;

Moronic? Sure....but totally worth shot...no pun intended 76.5% 2 doses Quebec, 69.5% Alberta.  something like treating delivering water, generating transmitting electricity. ""big"" mean needs profit driven solely privately operated.   People vaccinated still catch covid spread it.  Yeah, unfortunately given development Delta likely resistant variants, hope herd immunity vaccination directly/alone seems lost, since we've accepted living lockdown conditions, vaccine lowers transmission rate substantially, lowers hospitalization substantially (10x) prevents vast majority deaths powerful tool getting us this.

I guess follow laws, still sucks - considering anti-vaxxer parents *not* children's best interest mind. hurt? 2nd shot really bad. Ah oops, adults 92%, kids vaccinated.my bad Same, 2nd shot really rough. 

Maybe I'm weird, like idea mixing shots. One buddies got Pfizer booster 0 symptoms also get wrecked Pfizer shots. Idk anyone mixed rough go 2nd jab, I'm sure someone has. Probably pretty similar effectiveness too.

Overview here: &lt;- nice, understandable pics lived Japan 2002-2003 2006. saw plenty masks 2002. 

But like standard thing 2006, either. I'd say maybe 5% people would one Yamanote/Chuo? 

I guess depends describe ""common."" mean considered strange. remember university fine. I'd see enough people JR stopped noteworthy. find hard beleive 90% number, although reported widely. 14% UK 12 UK relatively old country. portugal really less 10% 12? enormous number people go retire what?  avoid paywall: familar Hanage, longer mainstream opinion. look lines link, multiple experts advocating removing restrictions.

The problem ""We‚Äôre woods yet,"" implies waiting bit longer improve conditions. Given transmissible delta is, we're never going less woody part woods this. good gets.

Thankfully, vaccines catching Covid matter crappy week instead losing life.  state absolutely pays them. Oklahoma National Guard. get federal pay title 10 orders (federal funding aside). definitely see targeting leadership though, opposed screwing readiness every unit state. still enough data antivaxers know doctor somewhere disagrees. assume antivax people give blood. brother antivax, yes dumb, he's like reverse vampire. Gives much blood body allow. 

I think assumed antivax people terrible. afraid/dumb. Although, get wrong real arsholes shove far I'm concerned...  Totally!!  Blood donations universally thought good idea, even vaccine hesitant people. wanting vaccine make someone piece shit every facet life. Joe Rogan Cause know bad don‚Äôt want country feeble men broke dicks. types welfare physical though, vaccine mandates directly destroy welfare many 30 obese. 25 overweight. 40 morbidly obese. think technical term 50 Super obese. Friday shots? us work 7 days week... 

If he's infected twice gotten 2 doses, probably immunity someone 3 doses infections. Even gets infected again, mild before. Many would willing go work sick job give PTO feel well enough. saying should, but... Legitimately heard someone say can't experiment horse drugs people could experiment vaccine. Can't even explain already done enough testing know horse drugs fucking work, thats real doctors prescribing it. see doctor online prescribe read script say doctor doctor legally prescribe horse drugs. wish making up. even talk matter factly it. talk like cracked code life everyone else wrong.  people care neighbors family dying ?

The phrasing poor anyway. Neither really great fit, better word choices/phrases altogether. 100% ""leed"". Yea like told would cause massive pms depression would like ok cool explains that‚Ä¶instead thinking actually going deep end NFL quarterbacks say though? That's get trusted medical news from, right? Idk, Singapore 5 million people, we've reporting 3,000 cases month now, 85% total population fully vaccinated, masks mandated everywhere, social gathering limit 2 (regardless vaccination) asymptomatic self-administered ART tests counted official tally. Though probably also cause almost nobody got infected recently. least right seems like wave starting subside. really happened consistency America. dire scenarios various states point. Yes, happened, - often. ""we're beds last resort"".

I honestly would love see situation unvaccinated stopped fully covered insurance et al due it. think big brains? let back wallets. costing us millions continuing burn nurses. 400k quit year alone (per NPR marketplace week).

Not even mad, enough crap life don‚Äôt need Covid I‚Äôm prevention. I‚Äôll gladly accept side effects, let‚Äôs honest true other, right? reflex, thought. they're sick, incapable imagining future might sick - bother getting shot prevent it? suddenly sick, thing matters finding way *not sick anymore*.

If told ""this medicine made distilling Satan's jizz mixing blood HIV positive newborns, cures Covid"", they'd demand double dose immediately. *vaccine*? ridiculous! That's dangerous! don‚Äôt care baths taken bleach dranken long idiots get vaccinated. Yeah blood donors support community empathy charity. Anti-vaxxers probably ones donating blood. /s believe still need fact checkers statement, ""Unvaccinated people susceptible disease vaccine for."" infer significant overlap set people likely donate blood set likely immunize?
