The bad news course time high downward trend still really bad there, especially healthcare workers. Hopefully people hear news think ease masks, etc. anything need double prevention vaccine rollout complete.

Stay safe keep fingers crossed. Agree , every time I’ve measured it’s low. also
Live Oregon rains lot spike. Although vaccine, reach kind herd immunity, caution still urged people weary make sacrifices. And, small nut bar groups copycatting worst Americans.

Both states large reduction mobility. explanation obvious one. virus comes waves. North Dakota South Dakota never really first second wave. first big wave. like states first large wave (e.g. New York, New Jersey, etc), susceptible another wave vaccines rolled quick enough. serology testing North Dakota indicates around 10.7% tested antibodies.

Trump culpable Cuomo brother Fredo idiots. Biden’s team already came said restrictions won’t lifted. know .com American domain right? it’s not. made decision, live it.  Doesn’t hurt take it. lot people deficient it. understanding studies showed vaccinated individuals still got COVID didn’t get severe cases. 34 year old deemed expendable...I mean essential...worker, I’ve already given metric shit ton last 10 months...

I’m essential enough get vaccine though...

So basically want give anything fun well...

Do want people take serious? people don’t take seriously... It’s really symptomatic asymptomatic ratio citing think. 

This one article discusses it. of, many cases mild enough people didn’t bother getting tested? What’s ratio? It’s impossible tell rly need 5 minute testing done airport security line. already know two people who've gotten first dose country thats vaccinated way fewer people America. people getting vaccinated daily getting infected. least US going hard forget.

It's really simple that. people who're bitching moaning lockdowns affecting economic situation never criticized antimaskers conspiracy theorists deserve lick sympathy. article states received vaccine. Thoughts medical whistleblowers lost lives. around time recall non state controlled warnings coming china. also wuhan resident able hack internet service post youtube video wanting warn world bad virus was. january people spoke still didnt take seriously. warned us still let planes till march, crazy. San Diego last week. 10 people independently anaphylactic reactions (albeit huge) vaccine distribution site within hours other. Since supposed 1 100,00 event concerned switched different lot. 

The state investigating lot Moderna vaccine whole. anaphylactic reactions lot. Texas though. Nobody gives shit near tell. Yeah agree. variants probably spreading since October here. Especially look numbers seen they've exploded. Oh, cool. Glad hear it. estimates, 1 3 folks LA County Covid19. that, plus vaccination reaching say 50%, leads think/hope herd immunity far off. Man vitamin research map lol No, least way Pfizer trial offered unblind participants early phase 1A 1B. yup. going administration said ""Not responsibility"" pitted states one another PPE's. give money states ramp testing. help get shit squared away vaccine become available. hey. Seems people attention span freaking goldfish. another days new administrations fault. Reddit actually believes China country world solved Covid 

It’s hilarious sad ~~two weeks~~ two hours Largely depend onhow fast vaccination long takes vaccine resistent variant appear. variants already Search ""athlete heart covid"" google fix problem without paying everyone significantly money?

Why would someone go college learn Quality Engineer something start $50K make job leave door go home actually quite stress free.

Aside fact really room advancement store clerk. took account grown faster expectation. think expectation 20 25% Americans would virus looks like going like 35-40 got second dose last week. mild chill 12 hours later 24 hours back normal. Honestly easier first jab, caused lot arm pain.

That said, know people much significant fever etc it. posted CDC saying this. right someone else posted CDC saying 91 million Americans infected. know believe. r/Europe pro-EU. coming dual US|EU (Croatian) citizen, culturally American. support EU though, believe projects. faith American government, astonishingly. That’s get voting supporting terrorist coup, guess? No, call commenter arrogant selfish, misinterpreting comment. 'you' final sentence reference previous statement individual still wearing mask properly. really work reading comprehension going around calling people human trash. going end pandemic 2 months earlier predicted.

What makes think predictions didn’t take account large number people infected? ""Rather one specific “bug,” term “COVID-19” actually encompasses constantly evolving varying virus changes moves populations time."" 


It's time accept several dozen variations, begin analyze search them, begin finding more. thing evolution time begin finding them, always step behind next. Super, South African strain looks complete vaccine antibody escape UK strain vaccine 3x less effective standard covid. NHS data 18th, faster .gov site still site uses data straight NHS. Honestly would've better vaccinate state state, starting smallest ones. Quickly reach localized herd immunity given location rather taking many months reach everywhere.  know what? literally nothing-nothing listen scientists experts much! epic failure leadership. live Norway death people vaccination als covid last weeks. Michigan first. Whitmer already trying weeks ago. Plus make here. Right everyone know got didn’t turn potato surge dodge. mean virus obviously surging across country, happening regardless holidays. 

Every single epidemiologist predicted specific date period could point say “this happened Christmas” way off. Instead virus continued surge slightly higher pace already surging at, really really high. sucks think there’s much curb community spread individual gatherings, that’s reality.  here. People come back ""The flu really bad""

 Uh No. worked thru ""the flu"" breathe sick Nov 2019 March 2020. EVERY known symptom Covid 19. diagnosed large/old DVT last Nov., hematologist considers unprovoked. here, earliest mutation. give shit WHO, CCP, CDC, arm chair ""I'm scientist but,"" person says. know went thru. still dealing with. Lmao say putting money behind national genomic sequencing surveillance network cannot help identify new variants future, could aid overworked public-health departments giving priority get tested, contact traced, could also used inform vaccine makers “a vaccine escape strain,” strain virus could render currently available vaccines less effective see small cluster new variant come community, react quickly,” Febbo said, “and raise awareness infected make sure best efforts contain also: FDA identifies 3 COVID-19 tests may impacted new genomic sequencing national surveillance isn’t way modernize way U.S. track take action virus. Beyond testing, contact tracing, isolating, could include genomic sequencing, monitoring wastewater, gathering mobility data, using digital sensors, according Topol. get vaccines full tilt, we’re going start seeing containment virus,” said. “And there’s going places like whack-a-mole, virus tends crop again. you’re sequencing, wastewater, digital, mobility, basically real time dashboard country, see that, ‘Oh, wow, Kalamazoo lighting up.’” mostly formality. There's single vaccine world safe use adults, safe use children. **Not single one**. surprised Israel goes ahead approves kids age 3 get with.

But case everyone age 16 vaccinated, IFR COVID drop 0.1% thus big deal even there's ""outbreak"" school. I’m even really sports high school wondering issue Going school 40s enough evidence already? Even reason roll vaccinations asap  misinterpreting comment. 'you' final sentence reference previous statement individual still wearing mask properly. call commenter selfish arrogant. Wait hold on. person got vaccine get covid!? would thought!  states around us shut way higher us. Look graph clearly shows this. 
  Ok that's brutal, quite severe punishment rules rules.

Wonder what's wrong student though.
How get warned multiple times still get message? Sorry, stupid but... chill? feel cold? Mate I'm telling know atleast 2 people australia sick got covid tests free. 
You believe think I'm liar, you. Come back two months see actual peak since fair bit noise reporting making difficult see without linger perspective. 

Remindme! 60days “virtualmoneylover Peak Covid death date” Sadly useless, always saying vague stuff declaring obvious days news already broke rate 7-day average daily new cases crashing United States incredible. predict y'all sub-100K 3–4 weeks.

Kinda lucky President Biden. He's inherited downward trend; keep ship course, solve like 95% problem months take huge credit it. Especially comparison predecessor. fewest number new cases two cases today. anyone says anything. Yes MLK day probably partially reason fact fewer cases today Thanksgiving Christmas still mean something You’re probably jealous don’t job money There's hypothesis would work ""better"" way, means many neutralizing antibodies vector second dose. issue example half dose used none trial participants age 55, comparison group include participants 55+. means mistake meaningless unless reproduce results trial participants comparable demographics. No? It’s open question entire time whether vaccine would prevent vaccinated person carrier virus, even kept safe effects. news suggests addition vaccine protecting vaccinated person, it’ll ALSO prevent transmitting virus others come contact Covid-positive person. math off. 250,000 cases officially day That's got million million officially. movie Tom Hanks google it. lucky raised around medical family. trouble communicating drs. many people lucky. try tell drs condition yet many people peddling theory ""It's flu"" even worse, ""I got covid I'm fine, minor!"" people.

Fuck them. doesnt discount fact smokers average thinner, contributing correlation, may marginal. doesnt explain vegetarian correlation, probably general thinner perhaps healthier. aware ace2 receptors remember hearing early pandemic, although much noise made this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Love said first term dude who’s barely going make one swear comment every reddit thread, matter topic is. Times solid science reporting.

This covers variant detail explains well illustrations. lot states surged time. like surges. Cases go specific areas, reach peak, start declining. Three weeks ago probably article titled ""36 states' covid cases rise"" something similar. happens science. Eventually narrows consensus.

Right now, studies suggest Vitamin worth it. Really? 10-25%? I’ll see people mask nose haven’t seen someone without mask entirely since like October. That’s 1-2 people per 10 people without mask entirely every 1 million counted new cases day, estimated 4-8 cases counted, terrible is, states start seeing slowdown soon haven’t already due fewer fewer available vectors virus. Yep, see spikes early December (Thanksgiving), early Jan (Christmas) mid-Jan (NYE). live Japan? There's absolutely proactive lockdowns, opposite fact (government subsidized national travel campaigns restaurant coupons encourage eating recently) contact tracing efforts effective low percentage people downloaded app. nothing mandatory like writing details enter building.

I see lot people conflate Taiwan, Singapore South Korea Japan consider covid response. Completely different approaches. Japan lucky certain existing habits factors already present prior outbreak (mask wearing, talking random people especially close quarters like trains, everyone BCG vaccine infants etc., low obesity good average health population) Unfortunately recently contagious variants covid caused exponential spike case numbers general public seems reached maximum point corona fatigue. believe case numbers Japan much, much higher, desperation continuing hold Olympics meant testing numbers kept deliberately low government. Check average testing see mean. could sign waiver return able go back normal would heartbeat. Essentially federal government Canada done. They’ve chosen September month every Canadian offered vaccine, 80M doses Pfizer Moderna delivered then. 

September decent ways out, also unrealistically long projection it’s based 2 currently approved vaccines used. timeline well speed AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax, 100% met Pfizer Moderna. speeds up, it’s win. stays (no vaccines get approved), expected. That's exactly happened PM Abe... trying force Olympics Covid. one start eating tobacco leaves? Wait, wrote comment saying Trump lied Covid full year lies killed 400,000+ Americans, mods would delete it. 

How come propaganda articles China allowed subreddit? Statistically, children low risk COVID. Low risk doesn’t mean risk. 0-9 age group age group COVID less dangerous many common infections like influenza RSV. Public policy health measures reflect reality Here, bag M&amp;Ms. 20 bag kill you, another 50 require leg amputated lose job heart problems rest life, indistinguishable rest bag.

Dig in. M&amp;Ms tasty? snack fear rest life. Congrats mild case covid. 1 million people got died millions worse you. Want fucking medal? Durrrrr mild case covid one get vaccine. Shut fuck up. want dang vaccine already 4.5 million Palestinian speaking live rule Palestinian authority (that's probably mean indirect Israeli authority).
The Palestinian leadership want vaccines Israel, prefer get sources. They're denied vaccine leadership guy love commissioned victory poster back June daughters shown pulling covid curve.

I mean, one's less egregious fucking **book**.

I dunno fuckwit comms/PR team greenlit one. incredible own-goal. Biggest failures China shielding China rightfully blamed. ""Raising hopes Well Chaos""

Just add qualifier end negativity. Reminds ""GDP up, Pandemic Rages On"". 

This objectively good development. Geez. Many nurses essential oil hustlers. nurse helps sell even more. That’s true, point surge won’t bad holidays. People get together super bowl it’s usually people they’re already interacting area, whereas Christmas Thanksgiving people fly across country see family. might uptick spread wouldn’t nearly bad Well, vaccine 95% efficacy. recall people contract covid mild disease. possible mild case, spread it, body got rid pretty fast, may even known it. We'll know months vaccine decreases spread, may herd immunity numbers, go 10,20,30% vaccinated above, spread go down. Late spring/early summer, come! YEAAA right... mean, there's none left, there's none left. feel this. experience here. Ah, gotcha. Well don’t know I’d say really need 5-10x bigger, general agree. departments current state configuration aren’t equipped kinds interventions regular basis we’re talking here. That's side effect. wifi microchip cancels 5G, covid can't grow. Science! said heard EU much way large scale vaccination May June means likely done sometime fall that's correct. FCS football lower level (D1AA). FBS D1 comments making optimistic, people starting wake realize living life like bullshit. everyones fed up, politicians cant shit, overthrow bullshit. Cuomo made lot decisions early likely CAUSED New York hit hard. vehemently opposed shutting closing schools way late. live New Jersey saw every day TV downplaying COVID saying outbreak like China Italy ""impossible"". Sure, changed tune eventually get credit that, early actions terrible. Probably so, think enough information say majority (and fact think information contrary). important distinction, people assuming cases symptomatic might lead less careful. Yeah that's true that's unlikely sustainable month two. European countries start paying go ahead line. Yep quit 8 years ago, never really wanted one again. Last week like damn really want cigarette.  completely prevents spread BLM protests, simple science. It’s dumb said Pfizer vaccine isn’t useful 3rd world. Think mandatory testing, destroying education, realize start with. Problem solved. Fear fearrrrrr Pfizer taking away vaccines Europe give Americans. last long several reasons expect disruptions pipeline. point exactly I'm mad I've going online University last year. one wants admit everyone knows online assessments bullshit. feel like degree going meaningless. Cute much faith gov would lost access important source information, especially first months.

China virus sequenced, release data. Two weeks later Au replicated virus first case, sequenced released data world. like China treasure trove shared knowledge. First 3.3 billion according official source, totally look like trying push narrative inflating number.
Second all, much helps Israeli military, 3.3 billion makes less 1% Israel's annual GDP. Israel good economy without US aid. That’s assumption Manaus story ever really well structured study. going unlikely JNJ less ten million doses available end February recall correctly. think they're supposed get 50 million that's going happen end April. ultimately people likely need second dose J&amp;J long run well. single dose designed temporary thing slow pandemic. said, important science find began. get part? expect dust clears, conclude good old-fashioned symptomatic people actually dirty work. supposed 1-2 day period presymptomatic thing said happen much shorter actual time symptoms, thing, us wrote mild cold/flu symptoms take action. Um....women’s basketball isn’t revenue sport. especially isn’t zero tickets sold games. Pretty sure schools would make money shutting women’s team furloughing coaching staff. around 500,000 people loved ones, apocalypse happened. Yeah, real reason smug even worse.  think going uphill battle get done 100 days. We'll see... surprised get close. 1 million day would get 50 million 3 months. given facts places extra doses vaccines concern mostly demand side getting 2 million day 100 days. dont think shame wearing mask Japan, people years.

If anything, Japan's youth older people seems laziness: want inconvenienced extra effort wearing properly. 

Most time could get away wearing properly too, since long face people bother even wrongly put on. 

If condition made formal rule though, get boot like guy. Japanese fuck around written rules. J&amp;J comes alive, may happen. Pfizer Moderna, think so. Haha guess someone feeling little defensive bad news. Maybe complain media outlets report good news China. 😜  one wouldnt even get tested wife tested positive, like what's point? would assume also positive quarantine her? brand 2020 IMO suck. one tested positive. days, zero symptoms, took different test clean. Yeah, people die seasonal flu, whole country forget people die illnesses every day COVID happened? going stay shut one dies anymore?

Fuck stupid bullshit give fucking life back EVERYWHERE Man wish I’d gotten thinness effect smoking. 

I hope due nicotine crap. quit cigs months ago switched vaping. Cuomo incompetent scumbag completely fucked covid-19 vaccine distribution, killed many nursing homes, recently issuing punishments hospitals using vaccine “unqualified” people. 

Like heck, medical personnel refuse get it, give civilians want it! distribute elderly! Vaccinate children reopen schools!

There point vaccines rotting freezers. simple Cuomo gets pass despite first state major outbreak federal gov't every step way harming chances success royal PIA. 
Even stupid shit daily basis, always get pass mainly due NY first state hit, everyone else got data treat disease procedures follow. 
We gotten hint Italy Italy 1-2 weeks ahead NY terms disaster. 
Even learned. Europe learned. Asia learned. Africa learned. Middle East learned, North/Central/South America learned. shocking number. even low estimate 2,000 passing per day right 500,000 death mark. stunned. good chance that. mom lives LA County sister works medical provider OC, able give mom link went public get appointment today. connection, would probably weeks would got shot. I'm saying 50/50 chance getting covid I'm saying test incorrect 50% time. people may get negative result actually positive. thinking covid, would go public, visit friends family, physically go work... Etc TSA program self-test agents try get weapons contraband security. success rate detecting handguns 50% across multiple instances testing various locations.

Incompetent almost doesn’t capture LOT colleges cancelled spring break order prevent this. don’t think it’ll huge issue. Well, let's say right, nice goal, happen 100 days.  dealing highly centralised authoritarian party-state like CCP's China, ""local leaders bad, Beijing good"" defence central government work, body ultimate exclusive authority select local leadership describe incompetent is... central government. system chose build, held accountable, even primarily local-level failure.

By way, though, also [pretty strong Beijing leadership key players initial coverup attempt. One wonders leaders appear held jobs spite apparent incompetence. 1st 2nd dose? I've gotten first shot, cancel 2nd? exactly. achieve effective immunity sterilizing immunity via vaccine. Effective immunity development antibodies prevent infection still transmit others. Sterilizing immunity completely blocks infection, including asymptomatic infection. 10K people nothing compared 6 million traveling Christmas. 

Let's bet.

People selfish feel disconnected one another. Lack sense community uniquely American affliction. Japan habit wearing masks pre-dates Covid feel connected responsible one another. Now, that's neccessarily based humanitarian good will. easy feel connected others ethnicity shame one another expected.

The fact people everywhere, ethnicity aside, perfectly capable taking responsibility others, whether law tells not. Expecting law part problem. go again. States vs States vs Feds.

This like scramble ppe beginning pandemic. agree looking lens locked earlier would keep spreading down. Though defense nyc mayor, recall last year around March, China undergo strict lockdown then, critiquing western countries inhumanity, lots obstacle clear nyc business concerns going hit economic shops hard. actually pressure scrutiny anounced lock down. Chinese restaurants hardly entered country, conservative Prime Minister people visit ""This staying prepared, assuring people got this, prepared it, go footy, go Chinese restaurant - fact **I encourage to**,"" Mr Morrison said.

This message continued _after_ Australia declared pandemic inevitable, eg ""Go Chinese restaurant, go football Grand Prix netball,"" said.

Although general rule, playing racism people angle nearly much US - conservative PM fact says racism [not know comments late March - point, restrictions already introduced _all_ forms gatherings here. State emergency state declared 15th Mar, we'd closed borders rest Australia end month strangely high density outbreaks Democrat ran cities.

There's surprises - vast majority cities _are_ lead Democrats. 50 largest cities US, [just Republican mayors.

This common political phenomena - cities dependent societal structures, infrastructure, degree cooperation, etc. exposed ""other people"", encourages views left.

The move away others, ""just give land stop hassling me"" becomes viable ideology.

_Further_, Republican run cities? They're South, disease know clear environmental factors, winter worse summer, etc.

There's massive narrative pushed right, Fox ""new"" reddit accounts, somehow Democrat run city problem. _narrative_ though, deliberately aiming [mislead pushed top propagandists certainly know doesn’t seem case Australia, seems sides isle pit differences aside times media same?

Although politics increasingly divisive, conservative party charge takes leafs GOP playbook (from open corruption getting-_straight_-in-to-bed media counterpart), like nearly Western world point willing sabotage country get ahead politically.

At least, extent letting pandemic in.

Wrt media, one really helpful things Australia despite incredibly biased private print media (nearly Murdoch), still relatively strong public broadcaster nearly everyone agrees least attempts balance. provides reference point media must contest with, cannot drift far without looking increasingly fringe. like people seen families, concert, prospective careers hold almost year life back.  Gonna side u/Pepperoni_nipps. wisdom matched areolas. Californian, I’m glad u/yo_gi_doh isn’t charge. I’ll wait turn, glad frontline workers taken care of. anyway, degree, supposed feel bit sore weather vaccine works. body learning fight particular bug. Ever thought deadly contagious would without precautions?  remember Democrats communists. something. thought already arrested. Thank much. Hope get better US actually ok right now, state isnt even lockdown, cases still falling. 3k cases today 10k+ weeks ago. Immunity conspiracy theory now. People already becoming less active relying computer social media interaction. need kids outside properly socialize.

People already becoming socially awkward rise smart phones. reasonably expect vaccine 95% effective preventing symptoms reduce transmission extent. extent precisely, I'm waiting eager anticipation find out! wears reading glasses. I've yet find mask cause glasses fog up. solution drop mask nose breath downward mouth works sometimes.  surprising all, fakes Sinovax appearing middle east pretty much 100% identical packaging couple weeks ago. It’s called Aftershock. Set first weekend October Sacramento! turns r/japancirclejerk I'd like say I'm one school enforcing covid safety measures like keeping open window, much everyone's chagrin. also see people wearing mask beneath nose time. 

Nowhere perfect That's it. I'm going movies. Well thought it’s clear prevents symptoms vs able carry it? tested negative that’s pretty good right? Well, works field, family members work office building near 5G cell phone towers. course going get it! :P Hell, even acted tone deaf, neither helped hindered health officials, would’ve far better outcome we’re facing now. It’s paradox, don’t mind line see pans out. take first dibs offered. I’m moderate. People placed vents generally need 2 3 throat lung surgeries year afterwards, vent tears insides. Lots people 30 wearing though (yes, know guy article 40). see plenty people little office wearing them. Lots people also used living virus, giving crap current state emergency place. Life pretty much going without change. Oh sure. spent Xmas parents early 60s, per usual. limited public interactions two weeks leading got Covid test made eight hour drive Operation Warp Speed begin heard supply would distributed based population make things fair. hasn’t — significant variations allocation. example Oklahoma received 10715 doses per 100k South Carolina received 6808 doses per 100k.

The following pages show vaccine allocations broken state vaccines (Moderna Pfizer):

* Moderna: Pfizer: allocations Oklahoma South Carolina seem fair based population. looking amount vaccines actually *received* states (versus *allocated* states) I'd imagine may show discrepancies due scheduling/logistics delivery differences states ordering allocation. Thanks! annoying article tons ads mobile. Also, fuck woman. Good trader joe's. already COVID, antibodies asymptotic? literally describes millions people right now. question want know far none variants proven resistant vaccine.

Plus, mRNA vaccines updated quickly. Pfizer CEO said would take around 6 weeks make new one needed.

Its something need watch lot fear mongering going on.

Try using anonymous web browser window. Experience? Plenty people lived healthy, active lifestyles also got sick. downplay it. That's claim. yesterday head 5% nursing home residents vaccinated. theory. vaccine gave bad side effect destined get virus bad. course acedotal. Doesn’t mean it’s going happen need people like world. :) play devil’s advocate, many viruses spread via asymptomatic transmission like SARS-COV-2 does? I’m though hopeful vaccines also stop transmission well symptoms. perfect way sum 2021 far Sorry, speak Italian  Honestly, I'm problem understanding point trying make.  argue troll ? I've heard, need show say smoker, that's it.

Part thinks way opening everyone pretending follow CDC guidelines evidence hcq zinc anything. really think rest world would sit cure show trump? US place virus - think that. Hcq zinc studied drug far pandemic failed every double blind test. agree rest post.  ...liberal individualism?  Lets government conspiracies like ? 68° F Guangzhou right now. Perfect weather ice cream mean I'm New England could go coffee cookie crumble right now. It’s tough time Californian. weep state people lose everyday horrible virus. However, us starting mass vaccinations, I’m hoping start provide sort silver lining. best way fight viral infection always preventing first place. highly contagious virus, rest world even trying contain it. assertion.  sterilizing vaccines fully prevent infection. It’s 100 years still don’t know many people died Spanish Flu. educated guesses. ""Gaining whole suite mutations quickly uncommon event. virus widespread right now, uncommon events happen—and happen once. usual two-per-month mutation rate may undersell coronavirus mutate unusual situations.""


So mean 'relax covid mutating slow rate likely less dangerous version' hot takes bunch BS like us suspected along. maniac eating icecream January (in northern hemisphere) anyway? virus survives better lower temperatures, store meat lower temperatures.  remember Pelosi [televised early days pandemic, assuring everyone ok come visit. 

I'll take publicity stunts age well 200 dollars, Alex. don’t understand countries haven’t called Tedros resign yet. completely bungled response.

Vegetarian non-smoker type blood. 2 3 ain't bad! people hospitalized. represent small minority people diagnosed Covid.  agree. Society accept masks choice. hope everyone wears outside sick. absolutely mask mandate. That's im saying. isn’t study, it’s opinion piece gynaecologist mean ""JUST FLU"" kind ""forceful attempt""?   old news ... nearly year ago first came out. anti-masker told me: false analogy (with nothing back up)... kind get that, mask protecting others seatbelt mainly protect (although back seat could lot damage someone front crash)... become religion people... crazy numbers people reddit, thought fairly left leaning going masks. really like big deal wear one baffled. mean China new outbreak north? 😂 stabilizing mucus suspending tar.  it’s clear pass virus others even he’s infected counterargument: literally given 15M doses problems. 

Counterargument 2: israel vaccinated 25 percent population problems. 

Do storage problems/random issues batches may issues. Risks exist. mean need amplify without caution. Europe yes likely.  sole ambition covid replicate mutation maximizes capacity one dominates. would succeed became dangerous impacted capacity replicate. Free? mean health insurance pay monthly covers it?

These people intentionally blocking entrance stop mask-wearing shoppers entering, definitely counts causing disturbance. Yeah really scientific answer I'm sure bothered responding lol. Maybe know super spreaders sure yet leave that. Oops bad... Sorry Reddit absolutely rammed anti-mask asshats intrigued read comments here... #gobacktoparler Mainly timing, activity being, everyone different. people superspreaders adhere guidelines cases ramp up. agree program promote healthy school lunches would good step right direction?  random image rate death/inhabitants. higher bar worse rate.

But clearly willing discuss given try discredit something like that. good case national health care provider single payer system effective work.
Here Netherlands we've privatising healthcare system past 10 years we're dead last Europe vaccinating. would've thought cutting costs healthcare would lead bad things? Oh really? lasting effects huh? Thank God confirm. someone situation left apartment entire pandemic except get groceries wearing two masks face shield, fucking sucks /: I'd happily test negative airports quarantine. Uh? concert? open world pandemic? California become one soon talented people GTFO greener pastures ;) looking 3 weeks ahead claiming yesterday's stock.

gotta relax lil' bit expect infrastructure delays.

this normal. sadly lives lost.

keep lockdowns up. Okay ya, see that. Functionally, kinda outcome though, assuming immunity naturally acquired infection similar vaccine acquired immunity. 4,5 doses given per hundred people 0,7.

Blame France please. Denmark also EU already vaccinated 3% population, show what's possible. EU countries vaccinates less blame themselves. don’t like people give medical advice aren’t doctors. debacle every level. federal distribution sucks. live NYS plan sucks state level. implementation local governments, health departments, hospitals sucks.

It's one giant cluster. appointment get first shot week .. cancel it. AMERICA mayor insinuated interview NY getting vaccines rest states infrastructure vaccinate people states.

But really depends bottleneck currently is. production initial delivery (as seems likely) bad argument. However, delivered distributed individual states states slow administer facilities store others run doses... well, makes sense give states vaccinating quickly.

One Pfizer. Two Moderna. arm pain varying degrees. One Moderna tired day after, he's older arm pain keeping up. Pfizer one similar doses. there's 76 year old aunt Moderna. Arm pain, slept like baby, feels great. Can't go solely though, shrugged chemo like water, boss AF. overall, none felt anything like sick, even really beginning stages, sleepless injection site hurt. possible vaccine feel pretty much nothing. would get antibodies covid infection well, control get vaccinated asymptomatic infection would still antibodies. society accepting masking choice default. strongly resent norm thinking something wrong person wearing mask protect others.

So clear: 

You able point specific calculations quotes source substantiate claim “there's correlation lockdown strictness deaths”?

Sometimes proceed like nothing happened hear depending circumstances either walk ask again. I'm wearing N95 interacting couple minutes usually even bother – much work.

thats bingo Both.

There seems different characteristics current outbreak, much infection children young people, yesterday 10 pregnant women hospitalized despite previously risk group, one died earlier - new mutation suspected far confirmation.

The public also tired less cooperative lockdown, probably part due vaccine mostly general malcontent. know get lot positive press vaccination campaign, overall government continue missmanage crisis petty political dealings. please consequences specifically people cover noses wearing mask? headline made feel alive. Moms fine! Thanks asking.

As example it’s hard say since don’t entirely know Pfizer Moderna operate. mothers trial worked early stages. normally would probably early indicator success. 

Moving medical perspective purely data science perspective however brings issues example. Outliers bad data hard spot based one set data alone. case trials multiple places running experiment make sure initial results good results hopefully accurate. 

So example simply wouldn’t enough information say good amount certainty vaccine. Since worked one sample size. could precursor help find success point time rerun additional groups it’s early say it’s definite success.    Freedom travel limited China though, color code app checks temperature checks airports train stations.

Few people going drive way north south car China. Encouraging system transparency first time instead punishing get caught? mean, China put jail quite bit covid whistleblowers ""disturbing public peace"" something. Unlike Pfizer vaccine, HGCO19 could stored around 2 8 degrees Celsius

just bit curious🤔 country implemented health containment measure there's likely case? ... See above, google ADE child cannot stand without legs (wisdom) Guess what, like EU things disliking others.

The EU led decades peace continent ease travel, adds level bureaucracy BS sometimes. people think benefits outweigh cost, others dont. preference matters more.

Question?
I run trial, give 50 people COVID vaccine ..all 50 come contact infected person. know highly unlikely. locked down, wearing masks..washing hands Uk. 50 get COVID vaccine called success? Seems bit vague me.

I hope mother ok. Tested? 

If not, asymptomatic? Headline says vaccine works. Antivaxx: hmmm seems good true. 50 richer nations, get economy back running, poorer countries going lot issues vaccine worry about.

The countries get burning house control, worry burning house. Maybe I’m bit confused, shit? Two friends got vaccinated households get infected didn’t get infected. news? Yes. Xi *expects* governors lie. stupid, know good terms Xi. like federal democracy governors independent movement, like Cuomo vs Trump.

Aldi became Aldi Nord Aldi Sud (Aldi north Aldi south) Karl Theo Albrecht started fighting broke Albrect Discounts (AlDi). decided split territories north south, later split counties entered.

Aldi Nord covers Aldis Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Portugal.

Aldi Sud Austria Slovenia (as Hofer), Italy, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, Switzerland.

But US, Aldi Nord different name:Trader Joe’s. considered actually fairly upscale.

Aldi Sud opens US stores Aldi brand doesn’t use anything related Trader Joe’s.  worth China claims commited vaccinating African continent ""top priority"".

Makes sense, cheaper insurers Aldi's bribe employees get vaccinated pay bills ICU hospitalizations rollout US disaster, rollout countries blazing inferno dumpster fire.

Anyone tries push false narratives online punished. many lives lost anti-mask, anti-lockdown, conspiracy theorists world? 

Jack fine, staying media standard procedure facing inquiries government, would know knew anything China. people close connections Jack, chairman BDA Primavera group, also confirmed laying low. Doubly so. aldi companies (there's two) operate store chains trader joe's aldi, respectively.  Mods happy lol Here’s take potential vaccine escaping COVID mutations-

The Moderna vaccine particular really, really good. Supposedly could adapt fairly easily new strain get doses relatively quickly.

It seems real challenge isn’t getting new version vaccine effective variants, it’s able actually distribute it. That’s delay would be, current rate vaccination good enough avoid scenario takes us half year catch variants, actually evade vaccine all. hope case. It’s I’ve interpreting headlines, however. lot officials seem think masking level distancing norm throughout 2021 even beyond. test positive second time? 

The flu, pneumonia, illnesses stop existing COVID. Young people died virus. Noone vaccinated has. Step 1, avoiding death reason get vaccinated 

An Israeli study yesterday suggested spread drastically reduced outright eliminated vaccinated. Step 2, get vaccinated ( likely) reduce spread 1. There’s still risk you. Young people dying ending long-term health issues. vaccine risk probably drop basically zero. 

2. don’t know sure vaccines also cut transmission experts saying it’s likely. It’s they’re scientists don’t feel right confident anything without data. nursing home patients longer need hospitalization still infectious? Two important things note ***before*** pandemic got here:

1. April 2020, Senate Republicans never confirmed permanent representative U.S. seat WHO's Executive Board. Experts later said surrendered influence China worked cover extent growing epidemic Wuhan. Trump's nomination 2018 sat long White House renominate twice – beginning 2019 March 2020 – administration, Mitch McConnell rest Senate Republican leadership showed urgency filling appointment. seat filled May 2020 pandemic full swing. July 2019, Trump administration axed American epidemiologist embedded within China's CDC 2/3 U.S. CDC staff stationed China. Health experts later pointed departed resources missed early-warning opportunity, would’ve able provide real-time information U.S. officials around world first weeks outbreak – time Chinese government stifled release information provided erroneous assessments.  point ‘the science’ countries, pompous twat internet thinking know best (again directed personally) ridiculous. 

And again...as already said, UK (and countries) agreed masks best way protect yourself. Like cases, “Technical analysis expert redditor” also loves making appearance sarcastic comment vaccinate get economies running money pay free vaccine anyway.  funny, da! says 40% experienced “reduced antibody response.” doesn’t mean much. don’t know effects immunity. remember immunity antibodies concept. Break think concerning otherwise you’re expert experts study provided tangible numbers even breakdown effects immunity all. good source. problem persists goal posts MUST move. 8 months ago variants, vaccine, knowledge now. 

If goal posts stayed regardless progress level straight stupid. don’t say. went buy groceries hofer (austrian name aldi) yesterday cashier mask nose. Yeah, get cautious without official data, messaging seems suggest 50/50 vaccines nearly unique history vaccines affecting transmission. certain point needlessly pessimistic. stomach, intestines colon all, different degrees, express ACE2 protein, SARS-CoV-2 uses enter humans cells. Meaning addition airways, gastrointestinal tract esophagus onward *potential* route infection well (to extent subject research since original SARS, still fully understood). yet list sure I'm imagining scenario Pfizer says ""we start testing new version vaccine modified sequences three weeks""

and Moderna like ""whoops, somehow vaccine sequence too, know how, oh well, already works new variant"". dont even get sick days.. vaccines targetting spike protein Virus. shit point imo  It’s entertainment news website. Outside pandemic affecting industry, really shouldn’t posting COVID stories. Kids likely wear masks school vaccine approved them. main lasting restriction.  Everyone! Look morally superior, righteous guy riding comments sections atop high horse! us access vaccine yet. We're vaccinating high risk patient right now, even senior mom high BP T2D still gotten jab yet. got everything else backwards came Covid, start now...this corrupt incompetent organization. Fire start over. existing data say then? Correct I’m wrong people dying covid old sickly. Sure young presumably healthy people died norm. Saying know active elderly person didn’t contract anecdotal saying know active 25 year old died it. widely available knowledge factors like vitamin etc playing big role, know aren’t trying deny that. someone emphasizing big factor health without knowing million unconfirmed hypotheses doesn’t mean they’re wrong need like silenced something. Maybe think he’s wooky edgelord talking vitamins doesn’t make he’s saying less valid. well, keep getting virus previously infected, there'll thing herd immunity.  year two get real figures US worldwide, it’ll interesting disagree elderly vaccinated first. opinion reduce impact spread COVID first focus preventing group transmits most. rankings would be:
Front line workers ( healthcare groceries/infrastructure), multi-person care facilities prisons. Next ages 20-40 years old group ones needing work/ larger groups etc. Retired individuals opportunity self-quarantine younger age group would able do. spread control next stage would vaccinate people highest risk death severe COVID symptoms.

I know isn’t popular opinion, space limited vaccines, believe priority stopping spread necessarily vaccinating vulnerable. someone familiar CDPH...I shocked Doesn’t completely discredit claim efficacy first vaccine? Really? Well damn Mom going go eat 14 days second dose, oh well guess we’ll eat home. Wake county North Carolina, Bay Area. seriously think meant would end pandemic? never meant somehow think embarrassed. That's incredibly good news! teach Midwest. We’ve person since August. school hybrid schedule, there’s still 2,000 kids school. We’ve red zone, officially, since December. It’s insanity. wonder Cuomo gonna Trump office actually start accept responsibility mistakes. Must hard.  It’s understanding antibodies wear faster virus mutate. vaccinated virus mutates, theoretically still mostly covered new mutation. takes 2 years mutate radically (which figure read one doctor) antibodies probably already waned yeah you’d probably need get updated vaccine. articles read (talking S.A. Mutation) said virus going pop one day 0% effective current vaccine.

As previous comments, I’ll try find sources talking this.  Goes way back parents, I’m sure. issues mental health, substance abuse, general shitty parenting addressed world-wide scale problems like this. makes think politicians eager continue lockdowns indefinitely? Tax revenue disappearing, along businesses jobs, people angry. would want 3 years? would ever hope political future? constituency that?

Maybe, maybe, 400,000 people dead virus rampant. rampant, restrictions go away. misinformation. nothing Phase 3 data suggesting say.  Wearing mask store excessive. example vaccine widespread clinical use selective effect — prevents disease infection — can’t think one!

What flu? necessarily prevent infection, make symptoms bad (like I've heard say covid vaccines 1000 times)? Yes they're sneezing coughing they're spreading less flu. says covid spread asymptomatic - heard before. thought asymptomatic spread superpower made nightmare is. can't control taking temperatures checkpoints?

The numbers gives Moderna - 39 placebo asymptomatic spreading, 15 vaccinated were. That's good news. Vaccinated people 60% less likely spread aysmpomatically.  40% chance ""very unlikely""?

When say people insisting vaccine vastly different other, must referring vaccines like mumps, polio etc., ""one done"" pass/fail type vaccine. one literally different that. See e.g. link posted, 15 people Moderna study asympomatic infected. 10 days followed negative test meets current CDC standards quarantine. He's probably good go. read anything even wrote?

What difference would make? entire thread *still* transmit virus immunocompromised person, regardless you’ve vaccinated yourself. people either never flu, think yearly cold flu.  Exactly. school district parent page, lot “send kinds back, need normalcy” such. throw fit kids sent home due contact tracing lack staff. It’s like stomp feet harder, they’ll get want. people ability realize real thing dealing with. sucks, global. can’t talk manager covid. assume it’s first “big thing” affected us. lived life changing event before, therefore seriously cannot grasp severity it. feel like might one explained concepts reddit.

Like always seeing explanation still amazes bit new people finding reddit. But... [relevant xkcd ""I friends here, I'm part group!""

More lies lies lies... phagocytic cells present spike protein creates scenario autoimmune disease could develop could known present many years.

They're not. making huge leap right touched finish line. cells take mRNA vaccine present basically identically infected cells. potential autoimmune disease mRNA vaccines walking street. knowledge one easy swallow tablet? constantly lying day one pandemic (mask help/we need reserve masks). dumb person would wonder people question advice. media fear mongering deeply unethical. vaccines still effective strains.

Note: this. Thing though South Korean population incredibly densely populated around Seoul, Gyeonggi-do Incheon. Around half country live well connected highly urbanised areas.

The logistical challenge huge, wouldn’t put past government able reach 400K target. Especially time call nearly half million troops lend hand logistical effort. Except consequences administering vaccine obscenely imbalanced personal level: fewer (other) people vaccinated vs losing licence career Everyone looking target dates, gonna know pretty clearly data well things working. 4000 Americans dying everyday current mask-wearing conditions, albeit significant non-compliance. drops 90%, we'll see precautions easing. whatever reason 1000 Americans still dying everyday, won't. got called one study nurses told could unblind me. told phase 1a believe me. supervisor get involved call back hour later. entitled opinion, data exists, peer reviewed not. welcome check original paper dr Feigl qoutes. option 1 herd immunity going work virus keep spreading people vaccinated previously infected? Seems like would never stop spreading want kill someone immunocompromised? Cuomo one that... salary $174,000 per year gets tons benefits. Yes, rich. that's reason dislike her. much news it. article February everything recent seems repeating already said. Instead automatically thinking bad people could take advantage something theory, try thinking good people benefit. 

As long everyone gets asap thats care about. brother got molecular test 10 days possibly infected, today got negative result. walk normally around house need wait more? First all, don’t say shit absolute fact hasn’t scientific study. Second vaccine ever created hasn’t least reduced spread. Third initial data coming Israel disagrees No, manyfacture polyethelene glycol suspend vaccine mixes well vaccine separate snd sink stick sides vials containing vaccine. localized one clinic. dispensed thousands lot Bay Area without negative reactions. Employers states myriad different time systems.

If exempt employee (AKA salaried), likely take doctor's appointments like convenience long get excessive one say anything.

If hourly white collar worker (maybe bank teller low level clerk somewhere), probably get 16 20 hours ""personal time."" That's used doctor's appointments things usually take whole day. still traditional sick days vacation days top that.

If blue collar worker like grocery worker, likely traditional vacation time. also likely need time employer get it. 1st year, get one week. 5 years, get 2 weeks, 10 years, 3 weeks, 20 years 4 weeks something like that. also uncommon take vacation block week.

And breakdowns super perfect. blue collar employee might boss that's legit knows folks cover worry doctor's appointments like. could salaried worker terrible employer use vacation days doctor's appointments. Sorry sources I’ve read said changes slower that. One mutation may 70% effective month new mutation 58% effective. assume point tweak vaccine get back close 100% possible dominant strain, similar flu every year. haven’t heard anything coronavirus mutating fast vaccine efficacy goes 80% 20% instantly. Again, sorry sources. I’ll try find statements read backing up. Make sure working smoke detectors everywhere. secret ingredient Putin’s saliva. I'm 100% sure Dude... one wants come here. emotional intelligence recognize upset deal adult instead level toddler.

Could something leaders teaching years. discussions merge again? “Two weeks slow spread” lasted maybe one weekend, moved goalpost 18 months, incumbent president tried use vaccine re-election switched years.

Then election ended, moved goalpost back sometime 2021. Smoke lettuce!!  vaccinated still contract covid19 still give people.

Real question then: younger, low risk population, *why fuck* care getting vaccinated then? We’ve told “oh herd immunity oh transmission” fucking forever, vaccine it’s like lul jk everyone’s asymptomatic now.

I mean seriously, what’s whole fucking point vaccinated people still spread virus. What’s motivation get vaccinated still mask distance, knowing chance getting covid low chance dying like nil  confirm, Burleson one. issue family. worst. right. Reddit loves firemen see macho heroes that, importantly, police, pretty much demographic. Mostly conservative, mostly white, mostly male, mostly terribly well educated. Sorry, rude.  Probably can't trace exact place someone got infected. number 22 students 5 staff could gotten whatever thanksgiving gathering attended--not school. Well heck yes Michigan vaccinating them. They’d shooting foot else. Wear mask, wash hands social distance possible otherwise good. There’s also good chance eye doctor also already gotten vaccinated well. guess. I've never really amazing quality experience everyone talking about. ranch dressing terrible, example.  Probably not. Umm that's entirely true. People make salary entitled overtime work 40 hours per week, unless management supervisors. Management paid overtime. also specific jobs department labor lists eligible overtime well. completely valid argument, weak one opinion. reasons everybody get vaccine first would benefit them, family member, friend, public figure, celebrity get first lifeline. Richer countries help countries, countries help countries ones world powers exact algorithm sub. sub might seem skewed view hot best comments pretty polarizing. scroll new see every single ""sky falling"" comment appropriately downvoted right away. care people get vaccine time. care people take advantage vaccinated wearing mask. I'm responsible idiots. I'm going virtue signal mask reason. Sorry. mask deemed necessity odd unexpected reason, I'll continue wearing one vaccinated that's going happen. Flu outbreaks havent threatened hospitals turn people away running oxygen? also havent meant health care workers large numbers, caught bad dose flu cannot work. thought? doctor nurse next time want urgent treatment appendicitis something? Doesnt happen flu... Ok, take 2 doses.

You know, like people made thing recommended Holy shit, really sucks.
  
That said,it looks like handled

That's nearly doomsday scenario article implies. “less effective thought” mean? Lower detectable antibodies? Higher infections? Higher severe symptoms?

It doesn’t say They’re “going” anywhere, won’t exist. They’re revamping European manufacturing facility (which Canada gets shipments from) higher output. Xenophobic? really. Aldi Nord doesnt Traders Joe's. owned Markus Foundation, owned son widow son original Aldi North founder. Pretty close though Ok, get sick reason Health Canada isn't? need get it!! biggest issue going many jabs possible instead making sure people get second doses. Even though mutations occur less frequently viruses number infections high almost doesn’t matter. variants discovered/emerging prove point. I'm invested news alters world population following.

If France saying masks useful. nations taking note. represents 12,000 doses. Unfortunate, though knew would distribution hiccups iron out. 

Somewhat silver lining, per MI Although unfortunate vaccine able used, pleased safeguards put place ensure integrity vaccine worked. first report vaccine potentially compromised shipment Michigan working quickly distributor replacement vaccine shipped part deal Pfizer. Remember, deaths hospitalizations lagging indicators. fact curve bent concerning. However, still like month, would concerned. Agree curve start turning day. Smaller infectious dose due higher efficiency invading cells. actually normal Europe, reduces waste. kids going die result isn’t ignorant

Suggesting harm happen death pretty ignorant. plenty discussion past days, mention past several months, regarding long term effects people. want choose ignore that, surprised people call ignoring issues arguments here. thing Lidl Finland. UK USA? really taking account fact countries lockdowns - lockdowns average age might lot younger. average age death also skewed outbreaks elderly homes. see consequences hospital workers nurses sick? whole point lockdowns prevent pressure hospitals. Remember thing allowed spread even rampantly , someone else say 30s 40s needed heart operation might able lack health care staff might catch covid hospital. could affect you. whole ""average age death 80"" another way saying "" doesnt affect fuck everyone else."" Come snake eyes may inquire country in? entirely susceptible population + transmissible variant ticking bomb. Maybe, I’m trying remain optimistic! yes, way many selfish people there. want done.... EXTREMELY well articulated, thank that!!  This. entire household 5 wants vaccine. want go back going out, fun. wear masks everywhere, remote work school since start. 

If idiots refusing, make room us! Meanwhile schools: OPEN ER emailed workplace whether would pay us get vaccine nope. company force people take would responsibility. Bullshit, mostly comes greed, can't even lil stipend 20$ smh Yup. commenter above, however, not. Good, want things go back normal!

No, argument simply know ultimate outcome children getting this. seem like suggest know, even though not. first time *flu* flu, remember hit matter minutes: got walk couch kitchen caught sudden sense cold, forehead got clammy, started shivering uncontrollably (I later learned called 'rigors', also COVID symptom). wrapped blanket took temperature spiked 103.

Thank much! shows much aggravating must brief descriptions provided before. surprise poorer countries better Europe US vaccinating economically active part population increase economic activity tourism follows. people also tend travel most.

African countries hit particularly hard, South Africa exception, typically young populations, honestly think arguable need vaccine less. google interested. find convicted destroying checkpoints disobeying lock orders. vaccine lasts days body. antibodies body makes last many months, changes immune system last years decades. 

At point enough time sure long immunity lasts. immunity lasts 10 years need wait 10 years confirm that. 

So far every indication level immunity lasts several months least still possible lasts years. 

In event immunity fade, give people booster shots. also say nice thing 10+ vaccines late stage development plus another 100 earlier stage even first generate 8-12 months immunity many chances get much longer lasting one. lol Sorry man, parents giving bad advice. Contact testing admin see make accommodations you. not, wait next test also wonder determine allocations. supposed roughly population size lot variance.

Also states vary lot like California 7x population Indiana states centralized health care system making easier distribution others don't. seem shifting model send vaccine places better distributing it. also make sense also exacerbate problems states together.

But key question nobody seems able answer happening doses given. get logistical problems. state send batch vaccine 1000's places distribution sure easy send many one place enough another.

I read every vial tracking chip unique number make sure counterfeit enable tracking. seems like able know every vial assuming scanned whatever. Maybe even that. new York numbers show people following social distance mask guidines  really hope month there’s going many articles successful results Israel noise doubter quiet down. don’t expect monkey chatter vanish happy it’s much smaller number people. It’s like nobody proofread article. hope so. U.K. variant 'escape mutant' strain South Africa, I'm concerned what'll happen get Moderna's vaccine (they say it'll good one year). get sick, develop active antibodies linger even initial Moderna vaccine wears off? works? right? 4,000 variants recorded date, one impact antibody effectiveness, minor one (that variant also likely extinct) empirically speaking odds given variant impact efficacy 1 4,000. impact likely minor. Remember, spike key virus use unlock cells, changed point antibodies work well anymore, would also lose ability infect cells. wear seat belts windshield absorbs impact Thank saying this, headline (and article) flat misinformation. study way touches transmission, literally someone hospital said ""we think since antibodies, able spread"" reported actual scientific study result instead offhand comment yet still need Israeli government approval receive vaccine. 

Not lab rats experimental vaccine 

The one 2.5 mil Israelis got? Jews Arabs?

The Palestinian authority ordered Russian vaccine. ""You you"" still mess.  Thats point are, fact, things besides correct nutrition healthy lifestyle plays role.

Such as??

Please tell me. want know.  aren't. They're literally committing genocide. thing pessimist fear virus would ultimately lead saving lives. Downplaying threat covid inevitably lead people dying could prevented they’d stayed home. That’s personally regard spread downplaying information virus malicious. words influencing people go get sick.

Well technically speaking, half people taking dies half immune afterwards 100% effective. Weekend + holiday reporting substantially depressed numbers, that’s going happen every weekend every holiday. We’ll get good sense today things stand.  Reference: I'm Japan pattern usually followed exams (covid covid) trains antibody

Are really desperate karma next day, Pfizer put statement 2nd doses hand expect supply definitely lack reporting weekend. see 7 day average Saturday Sunday Monday holiday. 

That said rollout complete cluster fuck definitely costing lives. lack planning / organization urgency federal level states local governments well. sad. losses virus profound impacts felt long time.

You see similar dynamic state local level, well.

CORONAVIRUS CHINA [Yesterday, January 18 Vaccination COVID-19 preparation Pfizer / BioNTech causes production antibodies coronavirus infection recovery - said representative Israeli Ministry Health Knesset committee meeting.

📷Israel started vaccinate people age 45 / AHMAD GHARABLI / AFP

""This surprising, know disease vaccine protect better disease itself,"" said Dr. Roi Singer, deputy director department epidemiology ministry, quoted Maariw daily.

Similar data published Sheba Hospital Tel Hashomer near Tel Aviv serological test vaccinated workers. results show around week second dose vaccine, 100 102 subjects showed six- 20-fold increase number antibodies, amount even higher produced patients became seriously ill COVID-19.

The results also show two workers developed low levels antibodies, however, noted, immune systems weakened.

Prof. Gili Regew-Johaj, director hospital's infection prevention unit, said study ""was line Pfizer's, even better expected."" - certainly reason optimistic - added, quoted TV Reszet 13.

Israel world leader vaccination campaign: December 20, 2.1 million people 9.3 million already received vaccine. Vaccination citizens age 45 began Sunday.

Czytaj więcej na possible win game biotag. Maybe swap cloth mask one kn95 available Amazon get vaccine soon can. sit around maskless people live even cave mask pressure. Especially country music concert Okay, would like fries that?  totally blew mind first time looked math. 🤣 wrong necessarily.  Also Spanish Flu worse wave October Mid-January. similar experiencing. Change season lot surge BINGO. don’t give single SHIT anybody else thinks does, received blow back family school. irritated handful us chosen remain virtual. make comments exclude us regularly. give equal amounts blow back. (Meanwhile one 4 virtual student’s parents middle schooler’s class pediatrician, so....) experienced sick child limp flu packed ER alone deployed husband. took hours child basically unresponsive ended flipping taking different ER immediately treated him. PTSD experience, cannot IMAGINE parents go long-term sicker children had. desire find out. don’t know sure kids don’t “pre-existing” conditions. things/diseases go undiagnosed sudden symptoms appear...it worth gamble. So, again, number ONE job ensuring health safety. don’t mean critical way cannot this. defend options, defend ours. whole situation f’ing bananas direct result national failures public health, healthcare, education, lack infrastructure support working families. That's works! Pretty sure intentional choice, malicious one. results stand are. Anecdotal friend hooked guy day showed symptoms tested positive guy never got it. never know. people saying children affected badly virus? Yes, far far higher &lt;10 cases week straight. We're also 2 weeks celebrated holiday time Japan everyone goes home (and Japanese people generally listened government's 'requests' stay home, requests till couple months ago somewhat adhered to. Government can't anything apart saying please. There's also almost testing, proper planned vaccination rollout anyone front line workers, likely Japan one (if most) anti-vac countries world. None? Taiwan? 

South Korea really good job too. Basically East Asia (probably helped climate).

You're saying leadership many countries, WHO, screwed really bad, nobody blamed? Covid doesnt linger. week two. like lyme. it..took medicine, fixed. Neither chronic diseases. Whatsoever. Also note hospitalizations flat/declining. patients die hospital. daily cases travel. quarantined tested good. back normal. Vegetarian ex-smoker type blood here. I’ll take it. Sure...Its also unfair don’t give private security escort bank  Nor... they? monitor quarantine every entrant. back normal. lol, they've moving goalposts least since America declared end history Greenspan said fundamentals changed. Remember Saddam Hussein harboring Al Queda weapons mass destruction? sure fuck do. know better, I'd say capitalism ran ideas *long* time ago they're buying time everything comes completely undone -- America becomes Brazil better roads everyone's refugee adrift sea global capital. article frustrating. makes sound like woman patient zero probable. That’s ridiculous. Based what? Rumors social media? rumors repeated diplomats? People worked getting sick colds august? 

We know one thing. woman missing. Everything else made up. Fiction.  know immune system takes couple weeks build immunity, right?  Maybe add friendly bugs saw article investigators faulted announcing pandemic sooner. had, countries would taken seriously. basically became mouthpiece CCP last year. Wow Im glad 4 questions got answered vaguely 100th time last 11 months. Im even excited people concerned living virus rather focusing responsible taking action.  GISAID tracking vairants. started track influenza tested vaccines become known takes weeks. reading vaccine makers test countries report testing. recall reading UK testing strain found.

Just reminder things reduce spread 'regular' covid19 still reduces spread infectious strains. mask properly worn, hygiene, distancing - remember cold weather aerosols spread 6' minmum outdoors risk like poor meatpackers suffered many super spreaders. Remember aerosols linger air hours take mask break room work bathroom like i've read have. scientists suggest must share vehicle someone household set far apart possible open windows away 3 inches air circulates **away** instead sucking possible virues right past face way open one next you.  answer ""yes"" matter effective vaccines stopping spread. 5% people protected even post-vaccine, anything maintaining masks distancing reach enough vaccinated ill advised. really, supply. Like germany 2/3rds vacination centers active lack vaccine, even active ones running 100%.

Given full supply daily numbers could increased factor 4 5 within week two ramp-up- Indonesia house here. report. interesting depending family dynamic. one person one family taken recommendations seriously even within household live together stayed separate living quarters impressive terms vaccine effect. typical family 1 random person got vaccinated otherwise semi-compliant masks social distancing like good percentage people avoided getting COVID everyone else family did, interesting. got second dose yesterday morning, think must lucky one haven’t felt bad. even scheduled work today expecting feel crappy... moments thought “is chill?” “Am tired normal?”

I took ibuprofen Tylenol every six hours shot possibly helped keep side effects bay tough principles. :p

At least live Germany, every noun capitalized.  blame game investigation things went control resulted current pandemic still raging. learn mistakes, doomed repeat again. seems pretty obvious. know people got second dose perfectly fine sore arm. grim  didn’t wear protection lol, idea. subreddit i'm sad can't participate /r/catsstandingup. even messaged moderators it, like there's truly meaningful discussion i'm missing, completely bother me.

also, washington capitals stanley cup, participate victory thread. okay; celebrated plenty ways :)  girlfriend, sister, _and_ mother nurses working three separate hospitals Japan. 

The one gets tested sister. Anecdotal, also, story hear everybody else, including friends doctors nurses.

Eventually anecdotal evidence becomes proper proof there’s enough it’s widespread enough. already know vaccines reduce symptoms nothing nearly vaccinated. That's truly matters. ability spread alter current course all, 

It affects important people keep wearing masks distancing post-vaccination, long slow vaccination ramp-up. could written this. I'm sorry gone through. People underestimate youth. making covid-positive person pretty much 100% chance getting infected? Good thing kept restaurants open mid-December though. doesn’t kill within hours, infected aren’t dying spread virus, there’s selective pressure forcing virus less lethal.

It kills weeks. kills, people generally well past typical peak shedding. Ok.   covid positive child going concerts? adults parents? even get in? some. significant make impact society tho. Dr. Birx :( argument immune response prevents disease body necessarily prevent enough virus replicating nose potentially exhaled spread others. America. 😭 Basically, ppl FRAIL. medical standpoint negative side effect could tip edge cause body shut down. It’s necessarily vaccine vaccine. frail, anything could cause bodies delicate homeostasis go whack kill you. So, yes, vaccine cause happen individuals. Basically, us healthy ppl need get vaccinated protect vulnerable. doesn’t worry me. worries affect ppl getting vaccinated think isn’t safe. I've read info believe science, believed vaccines safe effective basically now. news... someone who's parents high risk, really confirms me. gives much hope they'll safe receive two doses. feel relief received doses. Viruses sentient. increase likelihood become vaccine resistant use less effective vaccine. agree use two regimen that's tested approved. vaccines get approved we’ll see number increase.

It's like everyone forgot humans immune system. I'm glad sub finally catching onto Cuomo's shiftiness. long ago get downvoted -100 lower criticizing Cuomo, God Covid Response something.  showing samples Dec'20 Nigeria, New Zealand, USA, Israel, Australia Switzerland. like 15 samples listed mutation L452R. 

Also, article:

"" Monday, state’s \[California\] numbers mostly down, good. 30,000 new cases, 201 new deaths, 20,968 virus patients hospitalized 1,113 ICU beds available. last figure lowest number ICU beds available pandemic, worrying. "" 

'Just 30k new cases' population half big Germany. Germany, lockdown since december, tougher rules decided today upcoming weeks, plus, expected one rules everyone needs wear FFP2/N95 stores public transport; new cases like 14k per day so.

Only 1,113 ICU beds available?!? Anyone idea surge capacity, additional beds could create? aweful low number 40mil people 30k infections per day. many idiots spreading lot nurses dont care/numb feel like arent/cant much.

First, useful question. people Cuomo would do? Fess take blame piss poor distribution plan? make bunch speeches blaming Trump hoping everyone follows along likewise? ambitious career politician, choice no-brainer. news? disagree. Spreading every state time based population size states use critical first batches vaccine high risk people makes sense. Sorry keeping thread pretty, bad, good. false dichotomy. look countries locked hard suppressed virus vs ones let covid run free, stronger lockdowns strongly correlated better economic outcomes. would argue immune would fact prevent I’m Iowa too.

Got fix something reduce issues? r/imverybadass  LOS ANGELES (AP) — California's state epidemiologist urging halt 300,000 coronavirus vaccinations using Moderna vaccine version people received medical treatment possible severe allergic reactions.

Dr. Erica S. Pan Sunday recommended providers stop using lot 41L20A Moderna vaccine pending completion investigation state officials, Moderna, U.S. Centers Disease Control federal Food Drug Administration.

""Out extreme abundance caution also recognizing extremely limited supply vaccine, recommending providers use available vaccine inventory,"" Pan said statement.

She said 330,000 doses lot arrived California Jan. 5 Jan. 12 distributed 287 providers.

Fewer 10 people, received vaccine community site, needed medical attention 24-hour period, Pan said. similar clusters found.

Pan specify number cases involved occurred.

However, six San Diego health care workers allergic reactions vaccines received mass vaccination center Jan. 14. site temporarily closed using vaccines, KTGV-TV reported.

The CDC said vaccine cause side effects days include fever, chills, headache, swelling tiredness, ""which normal signs body building protection.""

However, severe reactions extremely rare. Pan said vaccine similar Moderna, rate anaphylaxis — immune system reaction block breathing cause blood pressure drop — 1 100,000.

The announcement came California counties continue plead COVID-19 vaccine state tries reduce rate infection, led record numbers hospitalizations deaths.

California, population 40 million, received 3.5 million vaccine doses administered third them, according CDC.

So far state vaccinated 2,468 people per 100,000 residents, rate falls well national average, according federal data.

Although Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last week said anyone age 65 older would eligible start receiving vaccine, Los Angeles County others said enough doses vaccinate many people concentrating inoculating health care workers vulnerable elderly living care homes first.

On Monday, superintendent Los Angeles Unified School District sent letter state county public health officials asking authorization provide COVID-19 vaccinations schools staff, local community members students vaccine children approved.

""Doing help reopen schools soon possible, safest way possible,"" Superintendent Austin Beutner wrote.

California nearing 3 million coronavirus cases 33,600 people died since start pandemic last year, according figures Johns Hopkins University.

The death rate COVID-19 Los Angeles County — nation's populous epicenter state pandemic — works one person every six minutes.

On Sunday, South Coast Air Quality Management District suspended pollution-control limits number cremations least 10 days order deal backlog bodies hospitals funeral homes.

""The current rate death double pre-pandemic years,"" agency said.

California 500 deaths 40,000 new cases daily past two weeks. Although hospitalizations intensive care unit admissions remained slight downward trend, officials warned could reverse full impact transmissions Christmas New Year's Eve gatherings felt.

""As case numbers continue rise California, total number individuals serious outcomes also increase,"" state Department Public Health said statement Sunday.

Adding concerns, California experiencing new, possibly transmissible forms COVID-19.

The state health department announced Sunday L452R variant virus increasingly showing genetic sequencing COVID-19 test samples several counties.

The variant first identified last year California states countries identified frequently since November several large outbreaks Northern California's Santa Clara County, department said.

Overall, variant found least dozen counties. places. testing found variant quarter samples sequenced, said Dr. Charles Chiu, virologist professor laboratory medicine University California San Francisco.

However, test samples receive genetic sequencing identify variants frequency immediately clear.

However, health officials said linked Christmas-time outbreak Kaiser Permanente San Jose infected least 89 staff members patients, killing receptionist. outbreak blamed employee visited hospital emergency room wearing air-powered inflatable Christmas tree costume.

The variant different another mutation, B117, first reported United Kingdom appears spread much easily, although appear make people sicker.

Just ask yourself: we’re unsure whether block transmission world talking herd immunity point then? would impossible.  
How talking vaccinating 85% Fall kids 12 make least 15%? 

Stop thinking every word comes whatever professional interviewee see unfiltered truth. lot meant manage sometimes even manipulate public. tweet say H2H transmissible. try find it. state's department health website, least couple months ago looked figure hell case fatality rate unreasonably low quote tweet: ""Preliminary investigations conducted Chinese authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified #Wuhan,""

It says China says clear information... Sorry, correct Information. doesnt say information virus doubt human human transmission. ""China... preliminary"" 

The second part comment argument ad hominem. 

Of course tried play down. time rumor deadly pandemic. like 100 years. experts listening said China pretty open virus time (other SARS1), guys week virology, Prof Drosten Germany. even saw hearing congress february expert said didnt see mistake China made wouldnt done country world.  able rest immediate family got it. careful followed guidelines:

-Masks

-Isolating

-Keep air well-circulated, etc.

 also chance false negatives asymptomatic individuals. got tested negative 7 days sibling first tested positive never really symptoms, maybe show. *entire* declaration Exact thing except dared suggest typically vaccines work preventing infection therefore transmission. guess need hand PhD well. means exposed COVID infected cells, possible stage innate immune system dispatches it. antibody response. immunity. However, might still test positive PCR.

There's evidence something happens. PCR sensitive sensitive. test positive one day negative couple days later, scenarios are: 
1) short course asymptomatic COVID immunity

2) infected awhile ago basically recovered, still shedding traces viral debris

3) rare false positive slow-mo Apocalypse feels like guess. far politicians go, finger point came point fingers. Thank you, hope too. must hell hating ethnicity there's nothing it.

also probably feels amazing live amongst poorer people, makes feel superior. Christ! Let kids cheat. know times quite possible US may already peaked terms new cases. 300k cases January 8th 10 days broken record yet. possible darkest day may already behind us. Democrat's first play call Trump racist xenophobe banning travel China, things got real. switched caring logic. Infuriating true. Almost infuriating west's response control virus. concept freedom totally skewed, perhaps healthcare workers bit different opinion freedom.

Freedom ""do want"". ""Do want, long actions remove right others."" covid shown surprisingly high number people take excuse act like animals guess.. virus spread human behavior, nothing else. Let sink in, pretty clear point sunk many individuals. almost pointless blame governments, officials politicians (albeit huge responsibility downplaying this) go parties run around maskless.  didnt arrest raided home. searched it, iirc Also, WHO’s forceful stance border controls. months, claimed measures would make things worse: end, countries successful response virus went hard early border control quarantine measures. enacted properly across-the-board, pandemic would slowed dramatically. anti-mask morons suck goddamn cardboard already?

That way still act like idiot one else affected, really win win Would able non filers form? That's used since I've work years. think able file taxes cause table sort way really know bad covid Africa able testing. I'll bet bad anywhere good question, kind like new flu shot every year go full clinical trial even though whatever strain think predominant. Even then, half sites order advertise Covid-19 safety measures, apologize orders taking longer usual Covid-19. NY. Seriously, point throwing projected death numbers us ? mean,really Ah yes, anecdotal results 2 person sample clearly supercedes existing data. Vitamin lifestyle choices likely play important role body's ability fight virus mitigate risk symptoms all. are, however, far variables play type commitment data metrics would highlight constant goal post moving. would drastic shift current public health strategy. One difference could vaccines currently injected muscle, may difference [antibodies mucous membranes nose probably see next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines focusing intranasal delivery reason, guess.

EDIT: Here's [less science-ey subject. true. providers forget mention still get ""wild pox"" even vaccinated. varicella vaccine make much milder, definitely still happen. 

I get really annoyed people look past try second guess experts' decisions advice year. leading scientists *don't know* reacts, transmits, best treat it, best guesses *beginning pandemic* Informed Choices, still theories proven disproven.  file taxes ASAP. Even income file taxes stating zero income. probably quickest way get stimulus. Yes course know skin tone (I mentioned it, also study people European ancenstry).

My understanding \~100 years ago life really hard Europe, take granted families bad vit systems could survive multiply if, example, undermined immune system. that's whole question. 

BUT, even people bad vit systems alive fine, maybe immune systems found another way work minimal vit D. case, experience generalized people whose bodies built way, whose vit low e.g. they're nursing home.

And main point makes sense bring genetic stuff anyway. test blood levels. get credit card/Amazon records compare % people buy vitamin regularly suddenly stopped buying anything (i.e. died), compare % people overall died. That's direct measure thing trying evaluate. Much better approach bringing genomics assumptions unanswered questions, figuring infinitely complex inter-relations need controled how. authors clever lazy. know see it, *that's MO too*.

But know. Maybe brilliant science I'm dumb see it. think test patient's vitamin levels. numbers lopsided studies suggest.... correlation != causation etc. etc. anomally worth looking into? California Monday became first state record 3 million known coronavirus infections.
The grim milestone, tallied Johns Hopkins University, wasn’t entirely unexpected state 40 million residents speed stunning. state reached 2 million reported cases Dec. 24. Honestly willing *prove* may remedied entire situation Maybe count administered vaccines per 100. around 30 per 100 inhabitants currently (29.43). includes second dose well, one would mistaken say 30% 30 per 100 inhabitants. However would correct, first one administered yet.

Anyway, right, wrong. consistent entire handling pandemic.

Public Health Message:
We know vaccine prevents transmission keep wearing mask.

Scientists:
It likely vaccine reduce transmission virus. Mederna even submitted data FDA showing this. 

Unfortunately public health message science thing. mean “wear mask till then”? thought current orders still wear masks even get vaccinated... Happy Cakeday!

OT: yeah, agree, instead measuring size tiny dicks.  schools NW LA county opened early November shut back last week.

Grades K-3 only. Yea. got arrested again? Austria also 9 million inhabitants. plan vaccinate 500k end March. 

""great socialized healthcare system"" lol beat trump Oh man I’m dumb wanting live somewhere afford house. Damn. sure people spending time Arizona everyone know orbit college educated lives well Arizona. Sorry don’t want pay coastal prices. guess makes soooo dumb! think article picks weird target UK instead countries.

But could sooner new J&amp;J vaccine gets approved.

even third tier cities modern advanced filipino city. 

imagine living country 0 high speed rail 0 national achievements proud of.

imagine actually living country that's named spanish king. 

i cannot imagine. variant could emerge, then, training ground chronic infection, mutations make virus better binding cells thus transmissible. may happened U.K. variant. could also emerge slightly capable reinfection. may what’s happening Brazil, already two documented cases reinfection new variant. place many people already infected COVID-19, variant little better evading preexisting immunity advantage. ""i'll trade covid deaths suicides/violence/hunger/poverty, in?"" - government Japanese parents might mean, unlike Western parents, throw children streets. Well, it’s funny see stray away actual topic start attacking people fact post something, start accussing witchhunt such. CCP bot something?

Is response called completely uneducated different forms government authority lock CDC Wuhan?

Can provide link talking regards CDC? officials Wuhan would definitely authority ""lock CDC Wuhan"" CDC escalated further, exactly know even talking about. know Trump cut like 80% CDC positions China pandemic. Nothings stopping working eating healthy diet. health one else’s responsibility except (unless you’re hospitalized obviously). Herd immunity hard fast number, possible reach herd immunity right things shut many people distancing avoiding contact, people go back normal let guard herd immunity goalpost moves. Herd immunity vary cultures well, lower threshold cultures people ahve larger concepts personal space everyone kisses strangers. 

A good comparison criticality near bomb reactor( reverse) need fuel enriched certain percentage, overall mass, geometry, density matters well effect point reaction Self sustains. hospitalized recover, 2/3 deaths even hospitals. front line Totally you. like coworkers like commute, sleep freedom MUCH better. presidency destroyed way COVID-19 Nah. Never bothered China shills bots here. year here, gotten used it. 🤣 🔥 fine 🔥 us never even given chance fuck spectacularly. late. enacted restrictions two weeks earlier (so early March) something like 80% NY covid deaths first wave could prevented isn’t possible Ferrer consistently awful, completely touch Take closer look article, got things confused.

The vaccinated man, Rick Salvaggio, *retired* pharmacist, there's workplace could've gotten from.

You misread, Thanksgiving never got together large family, never got together holidays, birthdays.”

Rather, man's daughter husband, pilot, got sick week Thanksgiving somewhere week Thanksgiving, daughter husband, pilot, got sick thought cold. Salvaggio wife cared 15-month-old grandson parents recuperated. baby started running fever.

So transmission Thanksgiving party, providing childcare baby sick parents. Obviously grocery shopping essential tasks could introduced virus too, easiest explanation what's given article. I've seen situations, essential worker leaves childcare grandparents there's option, Rona spreads way. Thankfully case, grandpa vaccine.

I think pilot (though mentioned wife daughter do). Even airplanes perfectly safe, agree likely BS, anyone claims *airports* are. haha call incentive!! Education population. virus NYC since November. time March rolled around already late. There's far much international travel coming NYC real difference made locking March. Oh god that’s unbelievable! going able live knowing im going die age 83 instead 84?! There’s much I’m going miss year, like sitting around house day watching tv, well potentially shitting myself.

Um excuse wear masks indefinitely every winter like every single country Asia, even though I've never traveled outside mom's basement, don't, selfish anyway, piece cloth, bother much? Numbers infected much better late fall. According R&lt;1 thirty-five states, compared handful states two three months ago. three states estimates 1.1, compared nearly every state 1.1-1.2 three months ago. put bunch surge hospitals around city, never used, closed down. 

And, hospitals came close overrun, many city hospitals well capacity, nobody bothered coordinate five major NYC hospital systems. Elmhurst war zone IZ patients every spare corner, nurses dying boredom hospitals fifteen minutes away ambulance. 

When thing over, hope 9/11 style commission, Oxiris Barbot Howard Zucker Dan O’Hara Deanne Criswell never allowed show faces public every again. 

Oh, Criswell apparently Biden’s pick head FEMA, apparently great fucking job running Coronavirus shitshow. Smart move, fully support this. single dose far better nothing. Tedros know morality bit ass. FYI smoker states give free vaccine right now. I'm sure smoking weed counts though. might worth shot asking. issue really abvout genetic predisposition thing - people really predisposed vitamin deficient? so, seems really likely part cluster things like obesity, skin tone etc. exclude analysis avoid multi-correlation problems. excluded factors, left with? People randomly Vitamin deficient year (maybe spent summer working office job?) even congenital hypo-vitamin condition, that's factor itself. Maybe people condition need less Vit others, bodies immune systems efficient way, they're deficient, need less ""normal"" people. 

And approach convoluted... measure Vit levels hospital patients? bring complex analysis 1000 assumptions, adjustments possible points failure?

And fact Vit recommended anyway... guess gets outside scope paper. cost/risk/benefit analysis, say supports idea anything. they'll get names cited papers they'll move ladder.

It would interesting know well model predicts actual Vit deficiency. take samples, can't find statistically significant relationship control-hobbled model actual levels paper go straight shredder. far tell Dr Fauci person note received Moderna vaccine. Everyone else gotten Pfizer. live here. confirm Red Bluff shithole That’s rich 😂. nurses felt way left careers, wouldn’t many nurses left haha. 

If people want ignore quarantine guidelines wear masks, that’s decision shouldn’t seek medical care get sick. healthcare workers put increased risk decision? people heart attacks, strokes, serious medical emergencies deal delay care morons ignored guidelines overwhelmed healthcare system catch COVID?? also 7th day straight declining hospitalization. dont think blip, think heading real. question fast low needs get us stop caring it. One big misnomers COVID idea ""have it"" ""don't it."" COVID-19 replicating URT, mean ""have COVID."" means exposed COVID infected cells, possible stage innate immune system dispatches it. antibody response. immunity. However, might still test positive PCR.

Not saying that's happened Musk. Indeed, tests may amazing. Sometimes tests simply great. People forget sensitivity/specificity look great, disease low prevalence, PPV NPV, metrics matter individual, way whack. Herpes stigma 1980’s. Bro think implied getting vaccine...but I'm sure that's lot ppl might read export United States next couple days? Yes, lots early deaths: [NYC Covid February 29–June 1, 2020: 18,679 persons died.  I’d watch movie  That’s good description! saying tastes like melted plastic. Generally, starts like Coke, lingering aftertaste hits me. He’s reasonable thinks that’s going happen guy got vaccine pharmacist interacts different people everyday.

The pharmacist retired article never stated side gig credentials. what's safe? Even Healthcare workers buying now. get important let guard up, vaccine generally available, mask wearing gone. might onto something. Biden? Jesus fucking christ Short sighted, vaccinate population vaccinate everyone else Oxford vaccine cheap easy make store countries. Vegetarian smoker got covid anyways! want refund :( CDC trying quarantine people coming flights, people said ""Nah"" ignored them. 

At point time, think couple countries also blocking direct flights China. People stuck scramble flights get around get back home various countries. 

It made sense, time, block direct flights. virus already US didnt matter hindsight. New York getting hammered first variant Europe. vaccines tested &amp; known stop severe cases covid... there’s data asymptomatic cases, longterm damage, transmission... trial participant negative covid tested great news... hopefully data stuff available February/March. Definitely good timing part. gets focus recovery. difficult decisions, like lockdowns, going past now. Apparently given spousal transmission 50%. makes sense me. No, Southeast Asia too. 

They people dying left right. virus either mitigating enough dies away, climbs climbs. IDIOT!!!!! number people office believe something like ""Covid mostly spread tank wagons carrying virus hotspots government orders"" ""vaccinations plan government Bill Gates chip you""

Ah, yes, left-hand side bell curve. lmao real tho Serious question: vaccine ever stopped transmission virus (for people mount immune response)? ever happened appreciable # example vaccine widespread clinical use selective effect — prevents disease infection — can’t think one!  also see ""I got COVID even though left home twice past ten months, go grocery store N95 mask"" posts. I'm little skeptical stories.  agreed! also trying advise gettinng family friends long hauler many family members front line workers getting talk other...i think also really helps explaining works, giving resources also emphasizing getting vaccine important ur self also others know efficacy delayed 2nd shot, finally given? anything? would thunk!  69420 lakh= 694.20 crore. said Americans can’t maths?

New York allocated 6th doses per 100k residents according CDC data tracker, they’re #18 percent supply used. 

When Operation Warp Speed begin heard supply would distributed based population make things fair. hasn’t — significant variations allocation. example Oklahoma received 10715 doses per 100k South Carolina received 6808 doses per 100k. 

I seen reporting they’re deciding gets week. missed it? seems like important policy topic.

Anyway, wonder states might start receiving bit less supply they’re administering quickly. point sending doses used. Like example, send doses administered last week state they’re already reporting &lt;50% administered. 

If slow state gets system improved catches could get allocation soon hit certain metric. finally good news &lt;3 seen John Candy movie Canadian Bacon good?  canceled first dose Unfortunately crowd majority Reddit. imagine represent second stage intellectual developement completely scientifically illiterate person.

The flu indeed mutate ways makes vaccines work thwy adjusted yearly based mutations well flu strain believe prevalent. 

All said, flu mutation rate 50 mutations per season corona seems less 25 according article below. Further, covid genome almost double size flue. means flu 4x higher mutation rate. 

As now, believed covid doesn’t mutate fast enough evade vaccines. possible, course, one mutation likely flue.  going put former concentration camps. convicted journalist lady btw? comfortable jail cell sleep concrete floor? 30 case Covaxin

Good guy, good vaccine creators, sorry news... That's vaccines work 🤷‍♂️ I'm honestly curious reason concern?

Over Netherlands new UK strain makes headlines 30 percent contagious use talk evening lockdown period. Yesterday papers wrote mutated strains worries people making vaccines.

Genuinely curious OK, think point here, complete lack unbiased, transparent pipeline Chinese news international audience.

For example, beginning pandemic, there's still lot speculations virus, Wuhan authority, later taken Chinese authority, published brief situation daily, including new findings new cases, see media translating information? Since read Chinese, saw lot proceedings appeared ""new discovery"". media then? totally failed, placing blame China, take least half blame. feel core. self-quarantined 10 months time leave apartment buy groceries every 14 days. terrified I’ll somehow become infected 11th hour eligible get vaccinated.

Stay safe, friend!  people think one allowed human. specifically want trial subjects mixing general population. (If worked home even apply ones city.) deliberately infecting people Covid-19 (for obvious reasons), relying catch ""in wild"" not. way know whether vaccines work first place.  Yes, optimists hate feed facts: viruses evolve become less virulent it’s advantageous. r/LostRedditors Wow strain now? cool LIES! Shall careful post Tweet, Dyslexia serious expected. Even year, people still can't distinguish ""not human-to-human transmissible"" ""no clear evidence human-to-human transmission"". UK variant easy remember, everyone uses it. Wow located?  made claim, pointed website supposedly provides data support claim, followed websites, original claim correlation lockdown measures COVID deaths/capita. provide data lockdown measures region associated public health outcomes may verify claim?

I could, I'm you. feel helpful today I'll send couple grabs show what's important overview sample 5 european countries different restrictions second wave (Italy Spain harshest, followed Slovenia, Norway course Sweden). Z-score axis, time Y. Seemingly correlation. Feel free play around euromomo pick match want. ask data - again, I'm sure provide it.

And, even interestingly, aggregate graph shows excess deaths european country, excess deaths axis (note starts around 40k). Deaths second wave line medium-harsh flu season. 

One would jump correlation causation say correlation measures strictness excess deaths measures ineffective. are, means would little difference we're nothing (where nothing something Sweden level). that's true, looking total excess deaths we've experienced (which nothing statistically unusual year year) means we're overreacting big time.

But I'm one jumps correlation causation lightly. I'm done handholding now, *really* want get better idea around what's going need. sort get feeling not, either way I'm done. No, touching food surface packages. call ‘Bavariant?’ think real reason impossible know already vaccinated wasn't. people want vaccinated also ones first wear masks.

Slightly related media talk mutations got vaccine. virus started mutating learned vaccine (note, least mutations heard still covered vaccine, vaccine concentrates spike protein (from name corona originates) spike harder virus mutate) Field Hospitals Army ICU something fishy come super-specialized Personal!

In average 5% US Soldiers Meds. Come Southern California 7-11! got plexiglass protect became free all. It’s like clerks need another reason get shot. I'm curious anyone read article actually lives New York knows what's going on. Cuomo mad federal government made sound like stockpile vaccines saved later waiting released. time, CDC updated guidelines recommend substantially people eligible get vaccine. New York followed suit found they're getting LESS vaccines week national stockpile exist. can't go back cancel appointments revert eligibility, they're stuck position need can't get next impossible find open appointments.

And everyone who's commenting ratio vaccines received vs distributed, I'm fairly certain includes 2nd doses, New York immediately puts side ensure every person gets first dose gets second dose time. necessarily case COVID peak transmission asymptomatic period day symptom onset, words really 'care' whether host dies not. Nah. needs immigrate US blend in. Yes. think one good reason use it. one categories file taxes file normal return 0 income afaik. start maskless time right everyone offered vaccine vaccinated. see goes. see cases start increase, means, mask up. masked society default worn mask. can’t enjoy pizza. eat it, don’t enjoy it. Like said...in colleges schools UK masks worn desks (even sharing desk students). 

In exams though students would considered socially distanced enough, would non-issue. is.... Even different time  People complaining 1A wasn’t working, see loosening include 65 older outside 1A. still seeing vials tossed, need expand 50 put essential workers regardless age phone registries. Guaranteed Apple Samsung already know millions essential workers tracking cells (they know demo, place work, schedules, etc).

This reporting democracy works. Sometimes it’s hysteria; case think it’s appropriate. UK least, decision delayed second dose weighed lives lost unvaccinated people, fewer deaths delayed setting. especially true considering we’re worse situation first peak. everything cut dry. safe everyone, opening everyone fine. 

That's different opening vaccinated. would work point specific calculations quotes source substantiate claim “there's correlation lockdown strictness deaths”? 

Are willing admit may wrong, scientific study concluding “stricter lockdown policies associated fewer COVID-19 deaths” may right? sfgate culture section I’m shocked haven’t already Getting rid masks reopening everything, including bars. *Especially* California. don’t write Republican representative! I’m sure “educate” rights private business tell pound sand. open worldometers already crossed Good point. would gently challenge though say, restrictions, exactly? Last checked, go vacation 95% countries could go pandemic. 45/50 states go eat restaurants, go movie theaters, hang friends. mandatory mask wearing, pretty minor inconvenience, real restrictions unless live California handful similar nanny states. 3 month ? 

That guy stayed airport 20 years technically behavioral nudge avoid vaccinated people wearing masks encouraging unvaccinated people wear masks. perverse consequence messaging causing people refuse vaccine think change nothing. always, nudges never really work well. watch much CNN BBC ken Abbott also said “numerous studies,” Panbio rapid antigen test ID rapid molecular test demonstrated sensitivity 90 per cent used person screen people contagious community, people don’t go around spreading COVID everyone else. probably even get option get vaccinated fall/winter, though... think issue politicians threatening medical licenses. personally think teeth politicians know dick medicine, idea one wants test case. didn’t say wasn’t irrational, surprising. need vaccinated least 60-70% community order virtually eliminate COVID spreading.

But remove restrictions need vaccinate vulnerable groups, point restrictions stop hospitals overwhelmed. need wait ""full herd immunity"" take longer.  booster, fine wait longer. question answered here: Oh no, come Reddit Japan “experts”. indian here, got doctor friends work hospitals, 80% covid wards empty now. India needs case study honesty, come statements like ""indians got high immunity"" ""ayurveda"" something think case study conclusive results would best sub brigaded something. mean Europeans US. millions sharing contrary, Trump lost, particularly know they’re talking about.

Your Trump example would fit example closer “some random guy bar saying they’re testing enough.”

However, many qualified individuals saying Trump lost, also many qualified individuals (doctors nurses actually experiencing this) saying testing isn’t done, relative frequency, even working directly covid patients.

We disagree line regards “anecdotal evidence” becoming “proof,” facts facts. They’re testing much be.

Still better US though. remember 1 million big deal Aka old people pre existing conditions make sure scared people woah said that???

I didnt even say **I** made good choices. injury air force prevents mobile. do, however, take vitamin supplements (as well C NAC immune system support). eat like shit unless gf cooking me. am, otherwise, relatively healthy. come contact many positive people last year, even jan known. symptoms issues. continue wear mask even though dislike it.

So please friend, tell said that?

No one **DESERVES** get sick. Though, surprise people arent good health get sick? unique occurrence? unhealthy people know unhealthy? educate people healthier individuals - starting good diet maybe smallest bit exercise?  seem like sections society actively fighting logical step. fuck point lost respect flu one. One study found 70% people antibodies end flu season yet shot could recall carriers play critical role transmission common infectious diseases typhoid, HIV, C. difficile, influenzas, cholera, tuberculosis COVID-19,[2] people infected other, well-known diseases transmit asymptomatically, too, tends overlooked among scientists studies usually focus seriously 2019 community study tried document underground spread. project tested 214 people weekly multiple locations throughout New York City 18 different respiratory viruses, influenza, slate cold-causing germs including coronaviruses. course year half, researchers found whopping 55 percent positive cases symptom-free, asymptomatic infection rates exceeded 70 percent viruses. actually developed vaccines mere days mapping genome virus. took year test get approval.

The issue COVID asymptomatic people contagious person showing symptoms. take precautions, thinking uninfected, end infecting others lucky.

Not necessarily. think are?  think lot people sub get nails chalkboard noise word herd immunity 70-80% infection rate mind (and associated fatality rate), (at least understanding) isn’t binary on/off switch.

The wife started feeling sick around time daughter.  
All them, aside guy got vaccine, close bubble possible. knows got infected. Probably daughter's husband pilot, although we've told BS story airplanes inmune. maybe 66yr old pharmacist got vaccine brought home.

Here direct link study: Jan 15. wish. live Riverside County, CA. warm almost year round numbers horrible. day... one day... 11k new cases. 82 degrees.  even read article linked lmao. gives extremely conservative estimate 83% protection reinfection, actual number probably higher. opened indoor dining bars two weeks June shutting back humans weak ass immune system. Like seriously people think viruses evade human immune response little tweak? We'd already dead case. it? It’s around long time there’s small chance could make vaccine slightly less effective.

That doesn’t mean vaccines moot covid lasts forever. known now? USA serious COVID! Big Lots day employees masks hanging nose like big deal.

No, still will. Can't dishonor way Samurai lol number possible allergic reactions

This makes lot sense. ""due possible allergic reaction"" phrase title plain stupid. mean makes sense, blatantly improperly wearing mask treated wearing one. heard Portugal since 8th grade social studies class well fair, May 25 28 weekdays ...  Thank needed laugh!! Nah California first, they're underreporting deaths. Florida may sus almost year shit people still arguing. must exhausting year COVID denying ""open-up"" morons. positivity rate within guidelines testing, closer entirety pandemic they're testing covid exposures would skew data towards higher % positive cases lower one.

In past weeks they've breached 10% rate indicative undertesting since gone back 10% mark. That’s still abusive. misplaced authority. Parents allowed stop children thriving due personal fear. would happen able create vaccines Covid?

Honestly we'd mask social distance public decided ""enough enough we're living this"". There's difference avoiding political news like CNN, watching local news general ran group guys vaccinating overpass. kind enough share dose me, report side effects immediate rush warmth, feelings euphoria, mild hallucinations. actually quite pleasant overall. can't wait meet two weeks second dose!!

That's pretty good herd immunity. Also Government websites study. public health information, may may based recent people sounding alarms “may” every day new strain know almost nothing ones giddy possibility social distancing forever. not, April 29th.

Whatever though, close enough. That’s double average flu vaccine. Also remains seen there’s going new data relating reported 90 percent efficacy half first dose. Anaphylactic reactions likely.

*""by protestors mean like. like? rioters."" What’s going happen get end Biden’s “100 Days Masking” Fauci et al. still say need mask

People going throw hands air masks garbage.

Seriously, ""100 Days Masking"" bold claim Biden made, really stupid one that.  we’re back normal second get vaccine Europe lockdown since November. one Exactly, everyone chose attend &amp; know could exposed Corona.

This pandemic going drag portion country taking zero measures stop spread. try stunt, zero clinical evidence side. one knows would happen. would go route proven options available? so?  could done much better, said, lot countries accurate numbers. either hiding them, infrastructure, test sufficiently.

Oh don’t want get vaccinated well here’s new variant might change mind. 

So don’t want wear mask respect lockdowns well here’s aa new variant might help change mind. 

I can’t see shit they’ll come next year!!! hope hyperventilate less revise.. dosages better countries people dying thousands daily even know singer, given song titles..i guarantee "" christian"" sort Also lot times, team sucked, sometimes even fault. pre-season practice, pre-season. Players got sick, knows much fault (I mean obviously is), vs much forced travel, meeting people across nation, going airports, etc.

This season * next many NFL fans. blame anyone.  classic Cuomo. He's setting Biden takes office he'll able say vaccine rollout going spectacular despite literally nothing changing besides occupants White House.  vaccine rollout could end even worse Cuomo would still say everything running smoothly due Biden White House. New York Post would believe vaccine turned blood stone don’t agree. effective vaccines now. idea would vaccines less year. We’ve also learned better treat infected patients.

I think things better 2021 last year. long slog get there. 

Definitely agree next month two difficult times. make sure tell friends internet argument today. they'll impressed.

Take state like Oregon population 4.2 million done relatively good job keeping cases 134K confirmed cases far. That's 3% population. Even quick pace vaccine distribution Oregon might ~20% immunity (cases + vaccines) end March B117 variant becomes dominant. 56% transmissible could seeing big wave come states low case numbers point. States ""earned"" immunity less issue new variant might near 40% immunity mid-March. laws protecting labor (enforced, anyway.)

Oh right, combined nations Europe sat Berlin agreed divide lot land full people enslave resources extract.

Maybe I'm right talking ""the West"" apparently King Leopold II singlehandedly managed enslave 12 million people even born conquer govern whole continent. take numbers calc back much extra death % extra is, get guess number extra death, bit 400k last weeks represented. put numbers perspective, estimated 430 kids 18 younger died 18,000 hospitalized due flu 2019-2020 flu season. Flu cause serious long term impacts kids well.

Despite that, lock close schools due flu. Coronavirus seem dangerous kids flu is, likely spread even less highly vaccinated adult population. see reason school isn’t back normal fall 2020 provided vaccines work. sad say, Dem governors going much willing “re-open” Biden would Trump - regardless vaccine progress. Think country car, central government driver, central government gets nowhere without cooperation parts. central government irresponsible, past, changing oil time, low fluids, etc certainly blame driver example Fuse fails, take old one out, put new one in. inevitable failures mechanisms machine. job fix mistakes, see Wuhan, government made mistakes, moving fast enough information action, outbreak got control, local party secretary removed party, Mayor Wuhan remained seated done everything power admit leadership mistakes make mistakes (the Mayor similar power level party secretary) local congress decided apologies efforts fix thos mistakes enough justify continuing occupation seat. Anytime local congress decides unfit, vote remove office. TIL 4,000 deaths day concerning things getting worse

Why believe things getting worse? aren't. would schedule time show up? decline don’t think need vaccine. Lemme guess piggly wiggly Devine street Columbia? ALDI place felt safest shopping since March. state issue mask mandate July, lot stores mask policies place either, Aldi did. thing people shop ACTUALLY abide rule. One way aisles kinds norm people already used following them. Aldi rarely crowded. friggen love Aldi. I'd open window two, realize might cold live that. dumbasses like Trump said that.

Cases deaths starting drop rapidly US

Not deaths, yet. Cases hospitalizations, yes. deaths always seem lag couple weeks. we're barely week's worth lower cases hospitalizations.

Sorry. thought would restrictions hospitals threatened. thought whole point cleared could resume normalcy.

Then became wait vaccine suggesting wait even longer fair third world countries wait.

People care now. waiting much longer. America Lidl :/ paranoid reason?

It's irrational wary anything new like this, reasonable.

That said, try get contact primary care provider beforehand. Boris slow making decisive decisions keep locking late. However, recent spike high figures partly due transmissible variant. 

Add policy errors, fact old population, high obesity rates low levels vitamin D, recipe high death rate.

You call sick, get paid full salary days work. sick longer couple days need note doctor still get paid. sick longer 16 days employer longer pays salary, government takes paying it. child get sick also get paid sick leave. (Norway) Jonagolds stock? -	Aldi US → Aldi South
-	Trader Joes → Aldi North

Two different companies. People like you’ve saying 10 fucking months. expect stop saying it? I’m honestly asking. want endgame here? want told act think forever it’s easier calming thing, holding life hands, walking around knowing may come next you?

I COVID. whole household got it. fairly bad. took seemed like forever get over. felt fine since getting it. know antibodies pumped me. wife soon fully vaccinated she’s “essential worker.” kids barely got sick it. Aren’t exact type people shouldn’t need wear mask anymore? say someone still wears mask gesture basic courteousness, wore mask months getting it. Even middle summer people looked like drugs. I’m it. medically mentally. need open damn country back let millions people already dealt virus get lives. tired waiting refuse get anything. 

Besides, Democrats got wish. got rid Trump, supposed root cause this. (Bullshit.) take credit open things back up. That’s wanted along anyway. plain day. let’s go. it. Deal consequences. Let people get lives get business going. don’t wanna go business you’re afraid COVID, that’s choice. Let us want that.

How suppose fix be, magically summoning water treatment plants, pulls money human resources thin air, suddenly increasing knowledge populace denied quality education? comments contradictory hurts, want end smoking obesity kill 460k 300k yearly average 400k dead COVID isn’t enough you? kill millions instead? I’m taking position it’s extremely rare suggesting base public policy around bat shit insane. mathematical perspective, enough people vaccinated average infected person infect less 1 person, virus head towards extinction. 

Your risk getting infected get lower lower across time, basically zero. 

If want play around math it, risk catching directly proportional number people currently infected

The change number people infected going proportional number potential infection candidates (number people yet immune) multiplied good virus infecting people area (the R value area)

For example, area R 1.5 initially, generation/cycle would 1.5x many infected people previous generation. 
If 56% people area immune, average infected person infect (0.44*1.5) = 0.66 people. generation 66% many infected people last, means number infected people shrink fast growing R=1.5 Ny 65+, healthcare, teachers, front line workers, etc get/have Lidl I'll super depressed, can't Americans stealing good European stuff claiming months line they're actually American Hot damn love Aldi's. vegetarian selections incredible. Yeah classic reddit, make fun people different beliefs you, even died. be. Trader Joe’s paying employees get vaccinated believe they’re owned Aldi. goes ways right - someone old Covid dies, it’s Covid death. Someone old takes vaccines dies, it’s they’re old. ""she preexisting conditions"" crowd strangely quiet ... Yes, point Aldi since inception. anyone else really getting whiplash headlines lately?

One day, we’re headlines like “New variant detected (yes, another one)! Vaccines useless!” “According experts, darkest days crisis yet come!” “Vaccine rollout disaster!”

Next day, it’s “Finally light end tunnel!” “Cases dropping everywhere!” “Immunity lasts years!” “Normalcy summer!”

I know happening last year, feels like reporting gotten way worse lately. know obvious solution “don’t read news then,” I’m scared I’m going miss something actually important way. anyone boat?

Brazilian Variant kind wax job get done salon. retroactively found tissue samples back then, impossible. real likely either.  really don’t think it’s hard understand immune systems cannot instantly respond vaccine, really shouldn’t hard communicate somehow many people managed mess Yeah seems unfair vaccinated people still hold back due people getting it. hope people get time goes along.

Checks out. Thankfully Moderna looks effective Pfeizer vaccine one shot. Disaster might strong word I've learned anything pandemic slowly poorly react change. never expected good, still 10x worse would imagined possible. Ok countries fucking shit too. government agencies always seem uniquely bad anything requires good grasp logistics really shock. yeah, would get tested. things cause sore throat virus (like post nasal drip allergies), even high risk person asymptomatic. coronavirus great, would want least know.

it sounds like already basically quarantining, got mother would good know it. new strain conveniently saying inside borders AZ? proper break really important work well

I proper break since school. should. TIL weeks ago Lidl, one employees stops me, tells can't shop without cart. Mind like 7:30PM, distancing issue. insists go back grab cart, oblige.

Then goes back stacking produce without mask. know amount things Christian scientists contributed science all? comment ignorant reality. I'm Lidl guy warnings sent January said ""PAHO/WHO recommend screening entry points regarding event, restrictions travel trade.""

They literally told countries need screen limit 23rd, human human transmission considered real possibility still advised limiting day later France found first cases Covid, people travelling straight Wuhan. What’s people want go forever? can’t begin understand minds work. point need put grownup panties acknowledge thing zero risk life. seemed understand Covid, mass amnesia set in. mean. could new strain figured make kids young people sicker earlier strains. dying thing getting sick all. think there's never research sterilizing immunity vaccines? think novel concept? Sorry I'm one actually applying science. Honestly, anyone thinks still fully contagious vaccination far base scientifically, really even know approach them. They're stealing basic worker rights around sickpay!

Edit: reread realised paying employees time getting vaccines work time ... Erm legal America? Also word ""many.""

""Many people ending back hospital!"" ""Many people suffering long covid symptoms!""

Really? *actual* numbers people recovered fine, they're millions. Rich countries going end funding vaccinations poorer ones, can't economies stopped half decade.

I fully agree life worth life - first world hold breath everyone else vaccinated first, much first world go back to. industry hanging skin teeth *for now* - wait another 2 years, instead happily paying support others I'm going need support myself. think vaccinating elderly poor countries going enable countries pay me. find shocking anyone would think someone worked somewhere one year needs one week rest, good go another year. even shocked cashiers joined (the same) union demanding change. imagine cashiers going 2 weeks strike get ball rolling.. Yeah, saying shutting international travel allowing citizens move freely within country nothing, doesn't. Shelter place necessarily involves stopping non-essential travel, favor tactic used appropriate. **Why vaccinate general population anybody wants first?**

Hear out. reading article mentioned Indonesia's approach herd immunity intend vaccinate younger population first think completely makes sense.

If ultimate goal achieve herd immunity ASAP waste time rolling ""phases"" (besides stretching supply). let anyone wants get it, get right away. Also, considering fact general population moves around spreads virus elderly sure.

Regardless frontline/healthcare workers elderly, place virus already raging difference make vaccinate healthcare workers first? understand deserve they're putting risky situations every day us given prevalent virus already is, they're much risk general population.

On flip side, country virus control like New Zealand Australia risk basically difference healthcare workers general population well.

If actually logical reason every country roll vaccine way please let know stand, makes far sense vaccinate anyone wants it. headline overly dramatic, likely worsen thing pretend trying help. 

People comfortable dropping restrictions vaccine active - 2 weeks second dose. Prior carry -wearing masks social distancing. hard complicated. get coming from. Though, it’s contraindicated small portion people. That’s it’s important hard headed people get vaccine protect people can’t. However, people probably wearing masks :/ Thanks done part continue part :) You’re flippant dismissive. We’ll manage risk, won’t completely eliminate risk Covid.

A lot news stories (and Reddit comments) play idea two opposing sides - one loves people hates freedom, loves freedom hates people. doesn’t ring true. seems like people trying find balance two values. We’ll give lot freedom save lot people illness death, little freedom save small group.

People reluctant talk part, seems death panel-y. creepy say it’s reasonable go dinner we’re X grandmas per week dying. think talking X. Instead, “one life many” versus “it’s fake,” neither gets us pragmatic plan. r/whoosh I’m sorry you’ve conditions prevented happy lifestyle past year. 3 months wife didn’t see anyone. didn’t get see parents children didn’t get see grandparents aunts uncles. wife enough talked expanding circle ready far were. comment pat back eye roll. sympathize hope vaccine get back happy healthy lifestyle. hope it’ll give reassurance risk gone.

We midnight 5AM covid-19 curfew. January 6 curfew extended 6PM 6AM thanks President Trump. work home kids school home.

I land boonies. thinking buying mobile home plopping there. figured kids could go outside play. local county board passed anti-masking ordinance covid rates soared. sure want go there. news read April, Trump appointee. seriously need AZ vaccine hope herd immunity summer. Exactly. solution fucking simple too. Start high age lower age requirement appointments become available. allows older higher risk people chance actually get appointment. keeps websites phone lines operational instead breaking due overloaded. always able fill appointments seen lower age enough appointments fill minutes. people going take first appointment get make. would surely better average elderly person. also could spread them, done age.


Source vaccine prevents spread?

I though whole point asking people continue wear masks know does. seem illogical say know therefore must assume one hand saying know assume other. happen. least 30% said refuse vaccination. re-distribute. Think change book. recall anything pull anything. shipment V2 today next shipment goes out, goes people boxes. There's re- anything. use V1 doses start V2. vaccine mutating fast bypasses V1 vaccines.  poor countries younger population obvious, even though may exceptions, believe testing capabilities rich countries. Lol ok bye Thanks clarification, spiteful misleading comments section dismaying (just people celebrating supposed ineffectiveness Sinovac's vaccine, one several countries access right now). look early reporting every new variant, initial headlines stoked flames fear vaccine resistance. Fair impression 0. 0 keep spreading numbers? did! Awesome thanks, makes feel much better getting $100 visit, 7 visits total Yep, together year ago place money guaranteed better people developing countries. absolute racism generalizations made developing world thread astounding. chock full empathy. No. Pfizer.  Twitter bad mental health actually taken medication decades. you? 

Calling names prove point! Waking morning roll dice. Contagious virus = bad think 4 cases control? Honestly goalpost risk people healthcare workers vaccinated deaths nonexistent; I’ll feel comfortable going back normal then. point, cares shed virus?  fine course they're healthier. ones skeptical Covid. early statistics. Looking children's health roll dice. think need show findings. Plenty countries, Namibia instance pseudo lockdown testing many nationals can. That’s really blanket statement make developing world. Oh wow. hadn’t thought “let go” would mean get obligations.

This article heartbreaking. thought well written taking process her. Oh god, book. kind douchebag writes book handled crisis crisis even yet. Ok claiming prevents infection. sure article translation issue clickbait title. Like said threads, advice us different different countries...which ranting people branding idiots wearing masks (that aimed specific person btw) particularly distasteful. 

In uk distancing drilled people important measure far...and government advisors (I think?) made quite clear masks offer much less protection. 

Children 12 wear masks anywhere students older ages take sit class. Thanks, think probably similar Danish mink variant. Keep seeing verified epidemiologists twitter keep talking increased worry ""Vaccine escape"" new varients vaccines going effective previously though them. 

Just mental health needs right now. heard chips activate chew them! Man headline desperately lacking context. percentage change zero timeframe tells skimmers (aka world) fuckall. 

That said, yeah, pandemic sucks. Let’s come bingo game it. guess new variant Russian next week. Russian variant sounds scary.  No. not. I'm fully qualified. new anything. update formula keep shipping. Use even notice changeover. going huge deal. stay ahead virus. Yet CDC guidelines prioritize smokers vaccination, claiming they're risk. sad can't tell whether trust CDC survey, are. say too. would never say people deserved die it’s tragic, govt completely mishandled everything reaping benefits established first world country. pretend isn’t inherent privilege fact govt fuck bad still get first dibs ignorant. understand, even vaxxed, risk virus infects breathing pathways, produce produce IgA - spread others.

So yes, would adding ""germs"". intensive long someone non-vaxxed, would happen still.

We yet know works like this, high chance :/ article claims doesn't, study mentions really disprove way. Sure, usually swallow food though. breathing food you, might want stop that, pandemic least. Last week one state (Alabama). things looking up! Welcome new administration.
 
Trust father government, knows best citizens. mean it’s *or* sufficiently high number people vaccinated.

It’s either or. everyone vaccinated, don’t need mask even might transmit. High risk populations excepted.

What ultimately don’t want *right now* people maskless minimal data minimal vaccine rate. see California's major outbreak related Newson's policies? Death rates going go significantly. Meaning, pretty much people died every day vaccines die vaccines.

The difference, vaccines effective, see less people covid positive test within last 28 days die. vast majority people die covid positive would still die anyway, covid not.

See mortality chart, 2017 2020. Mortality time year pretty much line mortality 2017-2018 flu season. see overview www.euromomo.eu 

The hope enough stop constant stream terror media. media stops hyping it. hype though, I'm sure. spokeswoman identified Guinea.

Guinea grand total 81 covid deaths median age 18 years old country. need vaccine US, UK, Germany, Italy etc deaths piling hour? Oh got now. Get lost going small change current vaccine still rolled out. going black white thing. That's fearmongering getting head. They'll pump vaccines, next batch they'll tweak V2 roll out. going know one they'll update keep shipping it. ""These useless! Throw out! 2 months V2!"" That's hollywood media you. Yeah that’s I’m reading AM, thank sharing. figured pharmacy wouldn’t tell something could hurt shot, wanted sure since I’ve seen people freak say contradicting things. feel like worst flu minus fever + insane arm pain. Science fucking awesome! 😎  Moderna? Well that's point: need tweet this. Yet did. 

It lent authority CCP. transparent, people arrested broke lock laws interfered public health measures. Also China cracks fake news anti mask conspiracy theories even truthful US.  reports coming Israel show vaccine gives people 10 30 times antibodies someone got covid naturally. regular immunity 8 12 months. Vaccine immunity longer. agree, I'm saying fur coats / clothes. 

But german. Wait, translation:

Just clarify: evidence particular mutation. UK mutant found, sequencing completeness. expect surprises moment. ""ZDFHeute"" summarized state information well: reason worry. likely less one one thousand chance dying likely won’t even get sick get Covid. 85 year old like one 10 change dying. Chill wait turn. You’ll fine. also data suggesting reinfection extremely unlikely way back last spring, internet experts still spent another 6 months arguing it.

Another red flag see still even know infectious asymptomatic people are. I've seen conclusions ranging ""Asymptomatic spread extremely unlikely"" ""Asymptomatic carriers 75% infectious symptomatic carriers."" takes one asshole study says, ""Based mathematical models think there's chance vaccinated people spread COVID easily asymptomatic people,"" masks stay forever. Let know find nursing home like sign up. stops transmission

Stops completely reduces greatly? They're expecting problem. (the CDC) said would probably take couple years mutate much vaccine useless. Well companies making vaccine able tweak formula (it'll take month) we're good go awhile. shit ""it's resistant!"" fear porn. say resistant really mean lowers efficacy existing antibodies little bit. completely sneak by. job properly need vaccines right now. Warning nations new epidemic dangers one main jobs, failed terribly beginning pandemic. That’s I’m reading morning, bad take ok after. trying make sure don’t screw up, thought could tough today nope lol thank you! quarantining every single person comes through, normal? Oh please. places world people regularly starve shit death waterborne diseases. we, places happen, hold back every advancement order wait entire world catch up, we'd living 3rd world conditions. Cuomo sent COVID19 positive patients nursing homes directly causing major outbreaks them.

He Italy thing loudly warned world it. strong advice nearly experts.

How possibly excuse reckless devastating decision? original text Эффективность вакцины складывается из ее иммунологической эффективности и профилактической эффективности. По результатам первой-второй фаз клинических исследований, иммунологическая эффективность вакцины «ЭпиВакКорона» составляет 100%. effectiveness vaccine consists immunological effectiveness preventive effectiveness. According results first second phases clinical trials, **immunological efficacy** EpiVacCorona vaccine 100%. Also may sound harsh, due diseases, poverty, famine etc third world much lower average age population. one largest factors risk Covid age, don’t need vaccine bad.

Look Africa, ~60k deaths continent billion people, deaths South Africa one better financially countries. 

1st world needs vaccine elderly, includes vaccinating young mitigate spread. 

Lastly, countries paying vaccine tax money citizens able benefit fact they’re paying it. Exactly. People assume vaccinated form virus bug zapper virus ever escapes. Sterilizing immunity possible, intent first run vaccines. got link?  that's way world supposed work. Stores physically remove assholes property. infectious UK variant makes sense shares certain mutations. don’t think cares likes power Newson kept California strict lockdown rules little spread causing current explosion cases people got sick randomly changing restrictions ignoring now.

He originally championed flatten curve science based approach instead thrown around restrictions devastate small businesses supported evidence significantly reduce spread.

If want deaths low need aggressively protect nursing homes. Newson's strategy better first months tons nursing home outbreaks. ""It's like need wear mask rest life,"" says. ""You need wear mask data, we're trying get answers fast can.""

This saying, ""Wear mask everyone wants vaccine one."" saying, ""Wear mask find empirical proof vaccinated people can't asymptomatically spread virus."" That's absurdly high bar IMO. Americans travel UK right now. subject 10 day isolation period PCR test requirement entry. can’t even roll fucking stimulus pua unemployment correctly, millions still waiting shit. true. take away fact there's absolutely nothing right points 1) potential SARS-CoV-2 increase lethality (the opposite way likely) 2) spike proteins SARS-CoV-2 really potential mutate way make vaccines useless.

So constant panic tv? virus REALLY low lethality mainly dangerous old frail people. best protect keep carrying lives? flu routinely sends hospitals overdrive, stop world 2020.

I'm saying justify we've done covid, justify flu next years. sure people believe acceptable. anyone doubt this, ask - last time felt need take megaphone go grocery shopping?

There huge number issues ""not right"" comes world health issues. Politicizing like statement ineffective way address them.

Of course countries going take care citizens first. like saying ""not right"" afford medical care elderly neighbor can't. 

Of course ""not right"" people access health care, reality. Getting vaccine individually change things lives, mentally safety wise.

Society can't resume hit herd immunity, since can't tell vaccinated person unvaccinayed one veracity.

But still allow freedoms without going back maskless normal. Florida also handing parks similar venues anyone willing wait long lines.

We really distributing vaccines manner. Yeah well go national radio tell us otherwise. that's that's made comment good faith. Agnes Wold, professor clinical bacteriology Sweden, clearly stated get transmitted foods. therefore I've ordering home lots meals since start pandemic. also got infected.. sure what, obviously, would shame actually thing. Capitolism 🎉 Exactly. dispensary Michigan “pot shots”. get free doob vaccine. But, going lock everything absolute essentials weeks get with.

That's march supposed about. great success decided keep next 10 months FML. handled whole thing really shit.

If travelling leisure for? Business? long time solutions that.

What travel ABSOLUTELY unquestionably requires given location? I'm genuinely curious *so* many people think annual cold flu. first time real flu knew would never confuse two again. Flu totally debilitating worst sickness I’ve ever felt. might want go back Biology class man. love store much ""fun fact"" probably ridiculous thing read today... population 9million. 6.3 million people still spread virus quickly. 

If people (non-vaccinated people) ignoring distancing rules vaccine started roll (or reasons), could reason high cases. Plus virus increases exponential growth curve me. Anything less 100 percent wear masks entire year according sub. Two months see picture Florida single person even thinking wearing mask sub going go onto hysteria. 2 4 mRNA - Pfizer Moderna point people double-blind vaccine trials get unblinded? antibodies generated B cells neutralizing... anything post fusion example. yeah antibody S1 RBD binds ACE could throw things wack.

External situations alter pace path evolution way. virus either disappear evolve way makes can't eliminate it, there's PRESSURE so. vaccine still worthwhile reduces number infections, thus limiting opportunities mutation. Hope guys get handle it. variant ripped us UK Christmas period, many hosptials crisis mode NHS knees twice bad first wave.

Cases falling thankfully trail destruction still continuing hospitalizations deaths

We record deaths reported today 1610 equivalent 7808 population size US go higher next week two. Maybe there's middle ground here. Like, rather say ""I've got two shots, fuck everyone else I'm gonna go live life"" maybe there's way sort ease back things. Yeah, absolutely family dinners assuming everyone vaccinated--you know, they're family. Board game night D&amp;D close friends? Absolutely! maybe still avoid super-spreader events another little bit; especially whatever reason one first people get vaccine. Maybe still consider going Irish dive bar St. Patrick's Day. Maybe still consider remote service Easter. people crowds, possibly *working* crowds, who've yet receive vaccine, depending Biden administration salvages botched rollout. put 2 gram piece fabric face fucks sake. Yeah hell rebuilding try move past pandemic. What’s done done. Pack up. 

 Reducing chance everyone getting virus allow things start opening back towards normal, jobs become available, leading people able recover damage done. say everyone job instead whining Read “dead aid” look “the aid trap”
Or confessions economic hitman European countries minimum vacation time starts 20 days year

That's legal minimum EU. Bank holidays top that, mention latter benefit americans. Especially since really strong lockdowns paid people percentage income incentive/protection. 4 years breaking lock laws interfering public health measures. Yes people take things seriously China cases. THANK YOU. want trial participants resemble average people much possible, matter timeline SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. things considered, pretty normal trial. environment controlled mean people sequestered. people potentially receiving vaccine future likely going work, getting groceries, etc... want clinical trial participants things. choice, risking lives people working with. 

The vaccine (Moderna) development since 2019, COVID new virus, COVID19 is, vaccines released today variety previous vaccine adapted new one gone trough pretty tough clinical trials. 

Unfortunately stupidity people massive antivax lunatics spreading fear miss information vaccine harming everyone. world can’t lick doorknobs, isn’t world want live even understand encouraged see statement sub. focus statistics, people focus one I'd prefer latter. 

We still couple months majority people vaccinated. nearly every state spiking danger zones again. Vaccines way hope good, want people ignore real risks next weeks biggest dangers largely preventable, Well California isn’t getting better. People must breaking lockdown. guess we’ll go full China start welding doors shut. Maybe ""jump"" wrong word... ""west"" failed start. making sense details vaccine here: 


It's peptide subunit vaccine targeting three epitopes, hence safer types vaccine especially immunosupressed people. 


Using modern solid-phase peptide synthesis easily produced huge volume, stable 2 8 C making easy transport. 


(So claim)  Herd immunity kick around 650k own. Combined vaccines think America top around 550k. Completely anecdotal attest idea people may come around hear people getting it. 80 year old Grandma eligible completely idea getting vaccinated saying want guinea pig said would need speak doctor friends (my words enough apparently) considering it. appalled frustrated would think way considering alive polio that. father became eligible recently got first shot weekend. relayed expressed fine, shocked said ""maybe I'll need help this"". still little unsure wanted wait dad 2nd shot, that's lot better outright rejection before
  
It really shows stories people around could convince people get vaccinated course going least severely limit spread. vaccinated still contract transmit much shorter time period infectious lesser virus transmitting. possible way true. saying numbers tenth abandon masks....which probably anyways.  mean it’s way complicated could write entire library “poor” nations poor. 
Don’t grossly oversimplify Alternatively, may see countries opt requiring vaccinations order participate various facets life - school, work, travel, concerts, etc.

I would hope within U.S., least terms employment [it's legal require vaccines (obviously exceptions). Testing often expensive vaccine.

Thanks advance! Hope staying safe sub-reddit! People gonna keep downvoting y'all, Japan since March 90-95% mask compliance, we're seeing positivity rate 10-20%+ right now. Yes, asymptomatic mild cases, due lower viral load, means stopped virus. Japan good case we've done lieterally nothing else try slow it. People pretty much going work shopping traveling usual entire time. places closed asked people work home. 


In someone says ""but y'all low numbers""! We've suppressing widespread testing since beginning, soooooo seeing numbers really mostly severe-critical cases. ha beat it.  surges like this, science medicine backing existence severity COVID - people still precautious. Yes, sir, today one lucky ten thousand.

A lot pretty nerdy stuff, enjoyable like nerdy stuff. Also SAT shown pointless, lazy way colleges get students. 
also makes horrible students. every town one kid hospitalized, would hundreds.

Yea every state followed would thousands. we’d way ~100 children dead entire course pandemic die whole nation.

Unless AZ crazy new strain state has, find unlikely, doesn’t add up. Big true  vaccine given shift times people might reluctant go get pay going decrease.

This allow get without worrying that. 

It’s really additional income, it’s cover give time get without losing money. describing called ""human challenge model"". administer experimental vaccine, ""challenge"" recipient targeted virus. process ethically complicated. research HIV, example. We'll never able use human challenge HIV because, vaccine fail, would bunch participants lifelong, incurable HIV. goes viruses unknown treatments, high fatality rates even treatment, complications. Talks SARS-CoV-2 human challenge around since October so, definitely something expected early development novel vaccine, especially novel vaccine emerging virus. see .8% btw. Got link? bringing wrong place dude mean, pretty clear presenting opinion guy. Everything trump involved fraud Haven’t heard xkcd before. Might need check comics. guess I’m one 10,000 ? Israel lockdown since 26.12 government wants increase another 2 weeks till 5.2.

But daily 8K-10K new cases located small amount cities government don’t try enforce, cities everyone mass events gatherings,

The big cities like TLV, Haifa, beer Sheva etc gets 5%-7% confirmed cases tests
While cities like Jerusalem Bnei brak get 20% (1 every 86 confirmed) 

Cities people go rules fine even first dose vaccine, cities without enforcement getting increased numbers new cases one tries anything that, “collective punishment” citizens without going enforce main source it, rate lockdown never end.

We could lockdown weeks government doesn’t care, don’t try enforce cities cases, everything like normal, vaccines won’t going help can’t even control contaminated cities u/tbox homie forgot /s? even people vaccines still getting covid, never mild. still efficacy 95%, 100%. severe cases yet. They'll beat covid cuz they're nothing whiners Seems bit early covid still ravaging country moment... Maybe, maybe not. know three kids (15 below) town hospitalized recently, stay multiple days. Two conditions making worse. every town one kid hospitalized, would hundreds. Hospitalized necessarily mean they're dead. time starts fade away (if does), we'll enough vaccines everyone go get another shot Yeah, US minimum required time off.

Employers fought pretty hard keep Congress/DoL enacting provisions regarding required time off. Even holidays guaranteed time average employee.

Their argument mandating eliminates one ways competitive employees. load horse crap. mandate 20 days vacation 15 vacation days plus 10 holidays, either competitive going beyond paying employees more. Well you....may never lived serious long term medical conditions effing clue.  Yeah, especially I'm sick af. Seriously, journalists live themselves?? never disgusted profession entire life. deliberate terrorizing public trying snatch away little ray hope appears unconscionable. logistic model controlling physical distancing, population demographics, variables found 10% increase self-reported mask-wearing associated increased odds transmission control (odds ratio 3·53, 95% CI 2·03–6·43).

I'm sure interpret this. understand direction, mask-wearing helps increase transmission control, magnitude confusing me.

Is 3.53 large impact, small one? Somebody smarter going tell number really means. Hello Charlie Mullins  late night replied. understand wording confusing problem appeared trolling manner. intent. guess venting frustration whole situation. Whether believe wanted clarify troll.

ALDI Customer Service yeah get old people vaxxed open everything right May bc fuck rest us right? think it’s important counter rising tide misinformation claiming restrictions continue years, tell people need couple months sustained effort, people would otherwise stayed course gonna start giving droves. already shut-ins social anxiety. made feel noble nothing. Smaller class size important, allows distancing organization. Problem becomes room students school bussing, likely require distancing board busses Lidl also exist US? go shop too. I'm EU. Even october I'd say. original comment would downvoted oblivion. Thus, ""so far."" Exactly, NYC HCW covers everything people clean hospital rooms &amp; receptionists heads surgical units. compliance rates hospitals ranged 98% ONE hospital 38%. would buy idea tons doctors nurses declining vaccines. Yeah, maybe several millions doses April, need something like 100 million doses Germany, maybe more. Curevac really important! AstraZeneca would great hopefully available authorized end January, hope Curevac provide better efficacy. sound worse claims hospital staff refusing vaccines. think anyone said 50x more, said 50% more. hypothetically, would gotten infected 30 minute conversation, odds infected 20 minute conversation. compensate risks adding extra distancing, better ventilation, better masks.

The science airborne vs droplet well understood. One model suggest airborne transmission happen artificial air currents carry lot virus fixed direction, therefore rare compared droplets spread, see case study 2 3 different model suggest virus concentration build like smoke therefore airborne transmission quite likely know two models correct, second one *feels* right, first one better supported case study evidence. yet see scientifically verified cases people got infected 6 feet apart absence artificial air currents, know probability it. 

Vaccines: rare cases, vaccines (such de-activated version polio vaccine) known prevent symptoms manifesting person still virus body might infect people. currently think possible unlikely Covid, see Right, every country world island tiny population, easily controlled borders fucking ocean dividing countries.

They well cases outliers, norm. nothing sensationalized? whole pandmic absolute fuckig tragedy, I'm arguing that. can't deny reporters latch anything get clicks.  care patience.   sure wish thing here. :( Also want put Costco paying vaccines employees, free get work there!

Production, testing, trials, testing, production, etc.... time gone. they'll fire drop dime without explaining why. ALDI nice shop at, bad work for. wondering like much. prices? times generic mean lower quality, lot cases, generic name brand product literally exactly same, even came factory admit part due anti-scientific attitudes, part also bad press erosion public trust health authorities, recently paused distributing large batch vaccines due higher expected allergic reactions. might specific California might improve quickly current problems cleared up. We’ll well way herd immunity 2 million people per day getting vaccinated. Everything open masks still required indoors may still capacity limits, especially restaurants bars. redder/southern states may decide drop restrictions. We’ve already number politicians, healthcare leaders, various people difference races, communities step forward get vaccinated promote others. many need? inject vaccine directly face? Would help? pre-print article available? seriously. Pretty soon going Q1 2022 ""just case!"" I'd say keep hospital occupancy sustainable level, means triaging care, it. still know long-term health effects covid, that's something think much concerning deaths even, especially looking QALYs. yes, think limited vaccine supply maybe triage certain frail people it. article actually say people protected there's less virus circulating air — less circulating community — advice restrictions may ease bit still recommended folks who've covid think it'll faster test COVID variant news-cycle. Dammit. Aldi North? mean scapegoat Iran-Contra? employer pay doctor dentist. leave family emergency get guilt trip leaving short-handed (and definitely paid it).

Like Everyone needs vaccinated. Good know thanks! know sum, right? people getting covid still getting covid. Maybe hospital running capacity thought ""he's young, tough home, 18 year olds die Covid"". Triage gone wrong. go dentist yesterday get crown fixed, receptionist I've always friendly announced joy mandating vaccinations office intent get vaccinated.

Too bad, really good dentist. actual arguments going keep attacking people personally, youre really getting anywhere. Thank mate, definitely see light end tunnel fast vaccinating! Nurse gave mine said one every 3 minutes busiest day. Fine, let's raise stakes. 100% get vaccine none attest publicly choice. 

We quickly forget NBA access daily tests average Americans waiting days even symptoms. Don’t forget people aren’t sick either. criteria ask Israel New Zealand take leadership. workers rights fucked. would anyone stay usa?  healthy young restrictions others they're unlikely affected virus last line get vaccinated.

I can't understand little concern virus. knows? Bosses like watch employees suffer something Nah. Merica bad, remember?  Stay classy /r/coronavirus. It’s clearly okay pay get vaccine. However don’t feel good anyone anything paying someone receive it. stupid take vaccine, let next guy line get it. Quit picking winners losers. Nice. far pfizer test variants, right? interesting. say half. tested positive three times since New Year (so false positive swab mix infection) due routine testing working hospital - can't return work there's negative result. shown symptoms. fever. new cough however fatigued. spent whole weekend bed. Sometimes chest pains. fits profile someone would struggle virus well. devastated tested positive thought I'm going cause serious problems. 

She adamant earlier last year (Jan) tested antibodies June there. October though well week (worse ever felt) cough shake since then. Work testing never shown infection point though.

Considering everything learnt there's still lot they've got find virus. Hmm... I'm sorry upset. I'm quite good spelling also quite good. Plz point misspellings. Actually already started lead Stripe engineer: VaccinateCA.com

He wrangled bunch people get better sense actual availability per location basis. fewer children sick COVID-19 compared adults, children infected virus causes COVID-19, get sick COVID-19, spread virus causes COVID-19 others. Children, like adults, COVID-19 symptoms (“asymptomatic”) still spread virus others.

- they're pocket big NYC business wants people back trains buses spending money paying city tax. state city income tax working home NJ CT.  vaccines?  Likely none work county government. wonder way experts volunteer help? Living governor miserably failed protect nursing homes first wave true fraud happen too.

Snagged appointment state ran site later on. figure state going supply places first less chance canceled. Right. That's said ""it simply reduces risk getting severely ill"". Maybe way structured clear. Yeah, welcome live fear long want even there’s solutions available; rest us going back lives robbed last year. I’m kinda glad mild Winter area isn’t lot snow. Dealing constant snowfall along Covid probably would’ve made lot people’s depression worse increased feelings isolation. Well...chances don’t vaccine kids 12 mid 2022. wonder suggestion “normal” doesn’t occur past coming. 
15% US population 12. Kind makes hard hit 85% magic number vaccinations. even 70% really. Interesting point. Continued masking lot people basically means life knew going shredder. 

And people problem potential changes don’t emotional intelligence recognize upset deal adult instead level toddler. Testing much 8 months ago means everyone tested. thousands asymptomatic cases every day go 100% unnoticed countries test much. Israel, testing much te rest per capita bound find much asymptomatic cases would go unnoticed countries add confirmed cases number. Texas = R, NY = D. ratio Trmp supporters / right leaning people / whatever politically anti-mitigation regulars categories keeps getting worse sub. former strong political motivation keep participating threads people patiently waiting vaccine ignoring often depressing covid related daily news sub known (since that's reality, whole lot good news related past 10 months besides vaccine progress). Propaganda lol countries world trade interest China. Chinese government closed border without presenting evidence, entire world would condemned ""economic sabotage"".

Obviously that's extreme example, he's probably right reduces transmission. question whether vaccinated people *can* transmit it.

On 2nd quote, phrasing bit weird... note bold Even immunized people become asymptomatically infected shed virus infect unvaccinated people, unlikely would result transmission another **vaccinated** person.

Try argue without constructing strawman attack points nobody making. gee don’t say EU ordered total 600 million doses 448 million people. month increased total orders 1 billion.

Not disputing main point, numbers off:

[December total, EU booked nearly **1.3 billion** vaccines deals Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Sanofi/GSK CureVac, **options buy another 660 million**.

[January European Commission contracts **2.3 billion** doses various vaccines -- enough entire 450-million EU population basis two-dose regimen per person, plus extra poorer neighbouring countries. I'm us either.

The us worst either problems exist canada individualistic liberal parts europe too.

Arguably COVID worse northern italy southern italy reasons. south sicily far communitarian north country is, culturally speaking. cover failings shift blame federal government.

Also, takes month vaccination body actually immune. that's going add another wrinkle public-health messaging; ""You come business wearing mask vaccinated least month ago."" 3 4 production sites Moderna Switzerland get point. wild keep getting downvoted saying continue wearing mask, hope stay mandatory.

I certainly want mandatory. NYC's subway system crowded, poorly ventilated filled people cover mouths coughing. 

I wear mask before, going forward - next bug may come around; even common flu/cold. 

Regarding downvotes; reddit, picture pretty girl sends posters murderous rage. Everything anything set redditors off. fact, reply get downvotes (as well gnashing teeth spittle inducing rage). Exactly afraid virus vaccine. Stupid stupid  moment first used term ""new normal"" knew long one Everytime someone said article overly dramatic they’ve proven wrong. Denmark. basic necessities without much choice. Nothing said incorrect Keep good work, ""rational"" person reads ""bad news"", trying enter sick panic, ""good news"", becoming delusional either bad news exist anymore ""irrelevant"".

I’m fairly young spoon fed conspiracy theories. kids losing minds I'm ya one. wear mask 8 hours day summer 98 degree humid weather hard labor. It. Was. Fucking.

I swear work home people mask daily trip starbucks. Even winter inside maintenance, masks total pain ass. boggles mind people bothered it. got 75 sixteen euros Lyon, even search hard. I'm betting anti-covid-vax people people take random drug given (illegal) house party right now.

Just...really? put away lines unless disproven can't time. painful needle arm? Seriously? coward are. literally ask nurse sure vaccinated me, that's little felt it. Figure speech. general population gave hysterical corona inch two weeks stop spread, wear masks, social distance, anything fun, blah blah blah. almost year lives taken. think 30% pos. rate may bit bad much different demographic tho....

Young kids primes lives dying war. Covid mostly killing people late lives. agree completely. leaders beginning realize sustainable none continue much longer. People cannot control (for part) get vaccine actionable information. control getting sick reporting data important. way, dont know live state reports both. Honestly US 60% uptake vaccine pretty good right anyone gig work food delivery apps? deliver DoorDash got email days ago working hard make sure drivers get vaccine soon since we’re considered essential workers. Sounds like norovirus. reason commonly called ""stomach flu"", even though completely different virus illness influenza.  would real number least 75k/180k people mean... mix both. absolutely possible get reinfected, cases (going latest data, around 90% cases) protected. 

Keep mind 10% true infection count (which much higher confirmed count, relevant many anecdotal first infections presumptive) still quite large number, accounts thousand people reported experienced reinfection. know decent amount make *above* cutoff work role *not exempt* specific legislation specifically makes non-exempt technical support (so like end user technology support) iirc 80% day day duties even make cutoff threshold. Dr. Walensky used term ""by mid February."" also went school St. Charles, go north east? think majority agree here. want forget masks completely things clear. Masks take away social interactions many aspects life.

Hopefully, emphasis staying home sick though won’t spread germs people. Lidl anf Aldi completely separate companies. New Zealand island tiny population compared rest world. 

They also didn’t anything China didn’t Wuhan. 

Thanks playing. got second dose Johnson Johnson vaccine (or placebo) trial study, get hype. reminder vaccines wait period like one two weeks get second dose fully effective.

So like, literally tear mask vaccine clinic, see aftercare instructions are. ;)

The vaccines available far need two doses, we'll see May/June. J&amp;J one-dose vaccine looks promising, maybe even need second shot! Considering good chance dose would ended trash, selfish. complete waste IKR. I'd seriously consider buying something like frequently air travel enclosed spaces hundreds people hours. horrible thing say... Oh wow that's excellent point. know much them, comments saying seemed like bad deal. Thanks positive answer, looks like one liked question :/ JC! right. article literally 3 hours old.

And I've checked Worldometers page too. smh. I've vaccinated polio tetanus. can't spread diseases either. 

If U.S. another country already eradicated polio, true apparently. vaccine used countries still permits transmission infected. Countries still deal polio get version vaccine prevent spread. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

A variant coronavirus Brazil also popped Japan early January. Evidence also mounting Brazilian South African mutants infect people already COVID-19.

That would mean either immunity new variants, immunity weak. Future research determine whether case. one knows yet implications mutations are.

Experiments underway major biomedical laboratories South Africa, well vaccine manufacturers, determine whether biggest worry justified: vaccines less effective various new variants. experiments include exposing virus blood serum vaccinated patients.

[Roughly 40% COVID-19 infections speaking talking symptomatic cases. read comments, specifically asymptomatic cases.

So said anything incorrect?

**Or misread** saying something issue with?

That actively infected, probably develop symptoms would chance spread household. percent roughly aggregated article linked didnt bother read through. would 16ish% overall. factors things included course. perfect # good sample size (80,000 people 50+ studies). information right side panel. Feel free argue teh drs wrote article issues it. Damn nobody got r/unexpectedoffice lol take weeks get immunity vaccine I'm sorry, commenting based partisan misinformation. Sick elders placed nursing homes alongside elders. Nursing homes separate staff separate sick wards asked take sick elders prevent hospitals overwhelmed increasing death rate illnesses/injuries alongside high death rate unprepared hospitalized cases COVID therapeutics treatments determined. 

Vaccine phasing also extremely important essential reducing deaths much possible vaccines produced distributed. vaccines rotting, stored months. 

And distribution plan roughly happening, rollout rough, important get ahead yourself. Imagine LA. bar needs zero 

This case year. may enough replies I’ll give go. could wrong specifics. 

So take , say, 20,000 people - preferably area virus actively transmitted ( used places like Brazil one point think) - randomly assign 10,000 vaccine/treatment 10,000 placebo - might something harmless similar side effects vaccine shot might ( case obviously) even pre-existing treatment ( think sometimes drugs prove one already licensed nothing). 

It’s important trail *double* blinded doctors don’t know getting active treatment either. wait monitor results, comparing two groups working difference statistically significant. randomisation checking would hoped remove ‘confounding’ factors might made difference instead injection - obviously don’t want older people poorer people one side trail other. 

For ethical reasons difficult allowed deliberately try infect people - though believe it’s completely impossible strict conditions ( probably happened history vaccine development?) - try choose environment exposed transmission. compare results work effective vaccine/treatment various reason it’s probably 100% takes time kick in. 

A second ethical concern arises vaccine/treatment obviously works illness particularly dangerous - happens companies sometimes break protocol continue giving placebo would dangerous participants. Patients treatment continue monitored long run even though might released general public, reporting system practitioners report concerning responses continue use vaccine. 

I don’t know helps confusing? hope got facts correct. 

Purely interest , well placebo effect shown treatments - patient respond positively *think* treated drug, also ‘nocebo’ effect patient negative response think drug *and* might negative side effects. things like ‘subjective’ awareness pain susceptible placebo effects others. placebo effect fascinating different different cultures - colour side pill make difference, injections stronger effect pills, doctor says effect etc. Thank you.

Which precisely I'm now. see vaccinations' effect Israel? Try reading next time. Funny thing travels China, Filipinos living slum areas better behaved Chinese cities. Btw aside starting pandemic, China also proud Tiananmen massacre. Guess proud too. also heard China gotten rid poverty....any bridge trying sell? course can't imagine live here...you live communist, totalitarian country famous poor quality fake products. 😜 Fun fact that's vaccines do, crazy know!  Mid 20s, also favor. reported 5 deaths yesterday though people understand exponential growth works seemed serious. Remember everyone encouraged go Chinatown? banning flights China racist?

No one knew anything. People nuts ventilators docs figured venting people generally bad. novel virus people idea. Plus everyone nuts politics everything gets coded politics latest mental fashions race relations. Yes, does. Without vaccine evolutionary pressure develop resistance. start vaccinating people pressure exists Ethics research something I’m quite passionate about. first started studies, took graduate level ethics course (in psychology) we’d discuss situations like this, often students would come different decisions stop study give placebo group(s) treatment, much information give participants, etc. ethics review boards, review approve research proposals, made collection people - experts field either! make critical decisions based ethical principles standards developed response immoral unethical practices (particularly WWII). See timeline ethics research here: give China pass even wrong. Guess Germans also give Hitler pass right? crazy ass reasoning there. always feels amazing financially well poor. won't. risk individuals get vaccinated well frontline healthstaff easier handle larger outbreaks (less hospitalisations, less deaths).

Reported covid cases also drop due people experiencing symptoms.

Many vaccination trackers predict healthiest least risk society get early 2022,but mean can't return working normal conditions vaccines widespread.

peace stay healthy everyone NJ highest deaths country, let NY take title us.  Especially NYC’s strain came Europe. It’s stupid ban one country leave doors wide open another. tha clickz think states supposed putting doses side second dose. read another post. 

As stockpile, according Reuters, correct, Fed's it, Pfizer started release several days ago order/ok Feds.

But hell knows going . course extent. Someone said believe they've already exposed enough virus immune... Jerry Brown would definitely handled better. Even think Arnold would used common sense learned mistakes quicker. first started. I’m obese. diabetes. Survived stage 3 lung cancer. symptoms, re-tested two weeks later negative. signs anything covid relates 8 months later. young wait September. falls age discrimination. aight march  Yeah mine days ago arm sore that’s it. coworkers didn’t even sore arms. I’ve heard second dose potentially worse first still bad. Hellinois fantastic job rolling vaccines. NY received 670k+ doses last week. Cuomo keeps misleading saying first doses, difference first second dose. Source? Memorial day expect well. People may take longer get back normal, normalish summer agree, apologize came across differently recognize US lot worse. strongly believe system far perfect needs work. I'm 28, keep mind body's reaction vaccine, virus itself. Hs sports resumed?

Texas crowned State Champs football weekend. Gotcha, certainly ironic 😔 This. actually impact spread, would know now. variants already everywhere. NYC NYS. 31 here. covid April 2020. Took 3 weeks recover, brutal, I've lingering issues. Workouts back level pre-covid.

I guess got lucky! long short entitled “Karen” wants buy groceries manager Trader Joe’s said can’t come without mask. Karen says violating Oregon laws. Karen spews idiotic crap back. updated since 17th, per site's dating. Meanwhile local Walmart half people, including clerks walking around noses mask. insane person kind revenge. like brother. entertaining friendly news personality. don’t, pointing irony us do. Covid, Cuomo hated throughout NY. way mayor measured dicks issues nauseating helped one. transit system basically neglected. Trump set bar low anyone strong personality semblance brain became cherished. He’s really nothing special. CDC running mass serological surveys (1.2m samples). NY state currently Wrong.

Biden's Designated-WH team made advice medical team, Administration intend lift restrictions 1/26. fact, plan strengthen public health measures around international travel order mitigate calm down. can’t stick zero covid strategy forever

That's goal. goal avoid shit show happening elsewhere world. vaccine hopefully end problem, need zero starts disappear. never meant forever. buying time. instance, buying time = less people dying. reasonable middle ground one? always empathized since beginning pandemic people's want social recreational activities. plenty people never really took steps make even small changes routines. leave rest us? us made sacrifices try ensure well community neighbors? keep landing answer look countries like New Zealand, even China. problem government problem. problems big individuals solve own, that's swift, effective government policy step head crises. can't expect individuals play central role solving things like climate change pandemics. Sure, play role, none us resources, capability coordinate scale necessary head things off. almost whole year.

I feel like proper planning everyone surgical/n95/FFp2 equivalent agree, sister allergic reaction(swollen red armpit arm pain) Moderna vaccine gone away okay now. makes nervous 2nd dose though, allergic reaction nothing compared possible death long term chronic lung/heart conditions. I'm little nervous girlfriend susceptible allergies. hope approve J&amp;J vaccine soon options allergic people, since RNA vaccines less known commodity mean yeah high school see that! honestly would rather pay small amount money options exorbitant amount money struggle find someone prescribed rx actually help me. yeah mental healthcare think everywhere needs catch tot level physical healthcare Thank you. shouldn’t let truth interfere biases. Going limb say ESH. That's educated opinion.
Edit: say I'm agreeing case came snarky anyone.  worst part I’m 100% convinced Jerry Brown would nailed CA’s COVID response still office. $$$$ J&amp;J market 1 shot = 1 vaccinated person. Could happen within weeks. saw 36 states decline. there’s newly minted highly contagious variant. Ah, wait two weeks. That’s answer everything. That's gross af  something hasn’t happened doesn’t mean wont. sort mentality mess first place. don’t even see ur action effect others ur selfish prick. know anyone field fully optimistic timeline. 

That’s scared death last year. legit experts like “umm yeah 12-18 months...huh...okay lmao...we’ll see...” like 😭 😭 😭 agree tbf, hopefully US trial reads soon bit coherent. medics supposed know 3-6 weeks earlier several cases pneumonia would turn connected caused novel virus? could run tests rule causes pneumonia, obviously wasn’t test Covid yet. Enough cases happen worry doctor sending patient samples Next Generation Sequencing, isn’t routine procedure. Actually that, Li Wenliang sent lab report said something similar SARS detected (I’m still sure diagnostic test was) alerted friends end December. that, unexplained pneumonia.  don’t think intended use protect viruses theoretically, correct. can’t find info seems HEPA filter cartridge looks good. 

I looking price kind absurd little reusability. Glad hear work taking care you, godspeed! also didn’t even read BBC article he’s replying with. Biden reversing Travel Ban Muslim Countries, Covid Travel restrictions put place. Despite article’s disclaimer it’s regularly updated, without specified date it’s worthless. mean still want catch it. would much rather get vaxxed worry much losing three weeks work. thr politicians fault.
build hospitals train people.

If vaccine going something you, happen shortly getting it. Article Text

Another coronavirus variant spreading across California, including Bay Area, linked multiple large outbreaks, public health officials warned Sunday.

 

The variant, labeled L452R, different highly-transmissible B.1.1.7 variant first found United Kingdom. 

&amp;#x200B;

 San Francisco Santa Clara counties among variant found. Scientists first identified L452R Denmark early pandemic, subsequently found California states last year, said Dr. Charles Chiu, virologist professor laboratory medicine UCSF.  


But officials seeing sharp rise variant California. mid-December, COVID-19 researchers detected variant less 4% California samples studied. early January, L452R found 25% specimens examined researchers, Chiu said.

 

Chiu said likely bias sampling, since California truly systemic virus surveillance program. variant appears widespread before, showing urban rural counties alike. 


 

While much remains unknown L452R, Chiu said mutations spike-shaped protein coronavirus uses infect cells. mutations raise possibility variant could reduce effectiveness coronavirus vaccines, although study needed arrive conclusive answer.

 

“The data far preliminary, basically raise concern may impact vaccine,” Chiu told reporters video conference call Sunday.

 

Experts currently believe B.1.1.7 variant, also changes spike protein, harm effectiveness vaccines.

 

In California, researchers public health officials trying figure L452R variant transmissible versions COVID-19 circulated state.

 

Dr. Sara Cody, public health officer Santa Clara County, said county — epicenter Bay Area’s latest COVID-19 surge — particularly aggressive monitoring virus.

 

“We Santa Clara County looking and, thus, finding,” Cody told reporters conference call. “Anytime large outbreak, take subset specimens send sequencing.”

 

Cody confirmed variant identified [massive outbreak Kaiser Permanente emergency San Jose, sickened 90 staff patients people led one death. inflatable Christmas costume, powered air pump, may helped virus spread.

 

Authorities working determine whether presence L452R explains many people infected Kaiser hospital conditions account size outbreak. teachers.... got shot today. 88 cases doesn’t seem much. people didn’t take covid 19 seriously beginning (a lot still aren’t). might get lot worst gets better. One thing sure can’t keep living like else really get hand. get idea ur deranged uncle Facebook. Meh, test worked I’d it. meant getting back normal.

Thanks Captain Obvious. Look around. cite 3 1 asymptomatic symptomatic rate? checked CDC recently suggested many 40% total COVID cases could asymptomatic, another Standford study looking way Diamond Princess showed bit short 20% cases asymptomatic. would pretty far short 3 1 ratio.  really need rely anything digital inform you, walk outside.
There really anywhere remind pandemic. stuff said isn’t smoking gun Taiwan News thinks is. Taking spike protein SARS putting another virus perfectly reasonable approach create vaccine facilitate research. whole point take important characteristic part SARS add innards *much safer* virus. study properties SARS (e.g. antibody neutralisation) normal BSL2 lab, rather handling SARS itself. Creating “pseudovirus” looks like Covid outside common approach e.g. Astrazeneca J&amp;J vaccines adenoviruses carrying DNA spike protein. literally posted 'the latest study indicates prevent transmission'. Go sleep buddy, thinking clearly. got month ago. I’m getting taste smell back I’m still coughing occasion there’s nothing comes worries me. Also I’ve maybe 50 headaches entire life literally half since I’ve COVID. stuff sucks much. obviously don’t work service industry UK flight restrictions lifted...

Edit: Source:   Thank God competent sane WH task force stating January 20th patients admitted hospital. vaccines quickly first place rich countries fund drug manufacturers basically unlimited money.  Easily avoidable methods? Restrictions strictest they've LA. explanation could that?

These possible speculations:

Herd immunity among idiots spreading it. 20% population goes bars despite pandemic wearing mask largely got along restaurant goers like. necessarily herd immunity among general population.

People taking seriously, masking, social distancing, etc.

Closing schools workplaces. So...simulation real life. McDonald's busy selling burgers. military ain't shit hearing sound anti mask karen's voice video may caused permanent erectile dysfunction. almost like.... wait it... everywhere months! what, 400k people dead. think percentage makes many dead citizens look rosy way slice it. Still taking seriously enough, we'll continue rack numbers. Good, nice see people finally catching on. does?

Where????

🤔 got actual data support nonsense? personally know several medical doctors (one ER doc) going take mRNA vaccines waiting J&amp;J approval going get vaccinated all. affirm well-educated (one Ivy League even).

Deciding take vaccine indicative person's education level I’m starting report ones like this. pure alarmism anything like city, call cops cops showed hour people already left. Antimaskers priority them. inflatable Christmas tree, source patient inside unmasked fan spewing viral laden air. missing stockpile second doses federal government misplaced? Actually far worse good student since crappy universities take without test. vaccine gave side effects, no? side effects pushed edge, no? covid itself. also agree covid isn’t killing people underlying condition is? don’t believe that, it’s pretty hypocritical way American media reports vaccine distribution you’d think performing worst world, QUITE far truth. really dense, you? first time I've proud country since 2016. Fredericksburg native, dammit indeed Yeah first time I've seen Snopes ""bend"" something  must live bunch assholes. seen one person without mask store since start.

I've literally hoping find person start shit. point employees get paid enough this.... positive thing manager (who pointed get paid enough) this. men want watch world burn. probably elect guys anymore. Pop bubbles prevent cure. throw school. “Back normal” aka millions people successfully working home, enjoying less commuting time family friends, shoved back office 40hrs week. glad don’t work office job Virginian say god fucking dammit P100 should. tier list 3M. looking 2071/2091 (only ones stock).

Covid definitely much worse, point I'm making even 62% l, makes pretty big impact propagation mortality numbers. last 16 years complained severe digestive symptoms, nausea diarrhea etc, told IBS sent way. Zero suggestions treatments attempt really much anything blame anxiety IBS. So, happens chronic diarrhea many years? Chronic diarrhea causes vitamin deficiencies, example, magnesium, causes anxiety deficient. finally discovered Celiac /gluten intolerance, help nobody, suffering long finally figured own. recovering , thanks none doctors ever made much effort all. Lately, seems mainly UK variant, including one Chicago. joking? 40.7k deaths counting. old post somewhere mixes bats Brazil done for. 50/50 chance false negative. would need multiple tests find truly negative. something like 2% getting false positive. number false negatives though way high risk it. elon musk two positive two negatives time That’s really issue now. it’s gov inability get people vaccinated. heard France got fucked anti-vaxxers give people document review 4 days vaccinated, truth that? not?  Well first comment bring mental illness using excuse person's erratic behavior.  Ive always said like masks identified idiots forgotten countries. Cuomo bares responsibility vaccines sitting around NY NY’s phased distribution flawed? can't expect one other.

This infuriates most. We're simultaneously pandemic dangerous can't gather Thanksgiving, completely non-essential businesses industries allowed carry on. egregious offender IMO professional sports. Dick caught dick nose live Japan would surprised strict people certain things. 

Generally people conflict avoiding things line gets drawn even look like going find plenty people paying close attention you. Even big cities one enforces. said area around Austin good. get trained medical people run them? Making new dr nurses respiratory therapists take years.

that problem put emergency popup hospitals overflow hospitals - staffing. hard time running current hospitals amount patients often staff also sick quarantined awaiting test results new strain 50% contagious. mean? mean likely get virus you? Like viable longer air surfaces? mean every particle get body 50% likely successfully infect you?

And practically speaking, updates general guidance safe outdoor activities? example, dangerous run bike without mask? maybe he’s asshole? without doubt local Wuhan local officials tried cover Covid-19. However, demoted fired incompetence.

A BBC article reported back February Yup, chills life horrible muscle pains. fun better covid. Don’t worry, someday he’ll mutate enough evade vaccine come back stronger ever!  reason think pfizer moderna cannot continue supply 8-12 million doses week. 

The whole first dose vs second dose thing poor way manage supply, doses exact same, reason 50% weeks shipment first 50% second, vary week week.

Cuomo trying shift blame slow roll NY, successful states far intentionally held back doses. 

There already several hundred thousand doses confirmed NY delivery week. AstraZeneca's trials mess, ... Clusterfuck want live delusional world supply exceeds demand. shitty journalism. [The original didn’t even look reinfection. second dose walk park. sick shit couple days. didn’t think one way hun. Calm pay attention ;) I’m vaccinated I’m done, I’m going back normal way that’s control. I’ll go bars friends go dates large gatherings amount please. reading looked it, company non-mandatory extension benefits. I'm entirely sure one fully understand exact details want provide false information.  COVID worse flu unless believe they're same. think love fatigue loss taste definition asymptomatic. even don’t TV NEWS there’s way hell read social media FEED/POSTS this, recent interview CNN mayor, go fuck themselves. 

The mayor insinuated interview NY getting vaccines rest states infrastructure vaccinate people states. 

Sorry, that’s works. Cuomo Deblasio don’t get take away national vaccine production give NY vaccines rest states get. 

I hope nobody allows happen. states get dosages cut vaccinate NY faster would tragedy validates feelings poor, poor state, life doesn’t mean much. behave want get suspended! Idiots likely super bowl parties though Comparing Pfizer Modern trials Oxford trial impossible. incredibly different testing regimes.

The important start 100% prevention severe disease. 30% chance bit cough fatigue cares.

Also UK government reports 70% efficacy single shot significantly 2 doses 3 months apart, though would like see data published. wh taskforce? Calm down, Tweak!

Here, fidget spinner. top ten place overrun zombies Flu vaccines 40-60% effective, still make impact every year. can't access risks know risks. Aside inflammation issue many KNOWN cases kids back school huge groups unmasked, mentioned long term risks can't address conveniently didn't. gonna hunch guessing wrong entire pandemic. Let guess...it flu. work anymore, 99.blah blah. think getting better, variants risk. We'll see. like swedish brigaders ganged anyone questioned ""the science"" models getting herd immunity back may. Hope right. arrogant know all's clearly weren't. really know saying, saying people allergic ingredients vaccine get vaccinated, seriously wrong. potentially dangerous contradicts CDC guidelines. Fuck off, here's country music Yeah. Idk. don’t think telling ppl oh well small decrease cases good. People take oh well don’t care anymore. Literally witnessed eyes am. 4K plus deaths day somehow woods cause it’s decreasing. Watch surge ppl take green light go whatever want take precautions.  headline seem perfect anyone else? needs everyone cheered end. number still sucks. Yeah haha saw stipend. May consider now. Seems like eligible one near me. Yeah. Here, seems like, reports vaccines tossed used, important stick rules vaccinate people.  Home school plus online classes much better education. lot people realizing this. People keep saying reality US literally everything feature enables virus spread. incredibly porous boarders, high amounts autonomy state citizen level, high rates obesity well high rates vitamin deficiency. top political climate anything trump said democrats would discard bad unless said first. Look HCQ example, studies showed promise administered zinc gave patients early infection. dems do? Champion studies administer zinc and/or give super late infection.  


Its simple saying ""the US terribly"" US would allways done worst virus spreads like wild fire well connected, free, densely populated countries. he's filipino. completely understandable coming from. reason filipinos (a country named spanish king) always thinks China wants invade Philippines, anyone wants country per capita income 3000 USD (lower chinese administrative province).

Compare data round explore country, gender age.

Get valid Data Region well global Context! Oh yeah instead signatures use hanko, life you, better lose cause heard hassle get replaced.

Also yeah, tourism Japan amazing, downsides apparent end living here. I've since November short time perception country changed decent amount. Notice states complaining supply vaccine ones super low usage numbers, like NY literally 1 million doses vaccine ready go. right move. medical studies clear now. already CV19 it’s late supplement, even hospital high doses. won’t make difference. However go sick CV19 already high VitD3 levels you’ll likely mild case. go sick CV19 low levels D3 much likely get bad case. lot spread gatherings. know someone right beginning, think March. Well got November family gathering. think immunity bring us point mass death isn’t happening everyday, virus mutating mutations concerning terms previous immunity. Hopefully mutates become less severe deadly point. Maybe I’m pessimist point small decrease cases surge 200k plus cases 4K deaths day doesn’t change much me. never gotten point first place IMO “I coronachino Daryl!”  work go virtual, schools forever

No!

I hope never happen Kids Teens need social Interaction much Adults! I’m trying doomer pedantic natural progression viruses necessarily get less deadly. especially true viruses long incubations. 

The virus pushed wherever pressure there’s reason more/less deadly could go either way. widely known China. Wuhan leaders Hubei provincial leaders fired, Beijing sent army enforce lockdowns. show strength central government Beijing know is. cousin avoided catching Covid entire rest immediate family caught it, definitely vaccinated. people catch despite strong exposure, whatever freakish reason. can't get COVID Moderna/Pfizer vaccines -- they're made virus. (Unlike polio vaccines mentioned.)

The question, though, whether someone vaccinated COVID pass COVID along they're exposed -- even get sick.

As side note, grandfather polio kid -- number muscles back. Lifelong problems it. polio vaccine came bet grandmother kids vaccinated earliest opportunity. said wanted kids, said wanted vasectomy, do? then, said might want kids, sure, vasectomy reversed? said definitely want kids? reversed back? Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap! did! idea physical toll three vasectomies person! manager must've babysat kids before. talking soothing tones trying tire little tyke out. states holding 50% reserve vaccine believed feds thing? work go virtual, schools forever flu vaccine regularly 30-50% effective infection, although it’s usually much better preventing severe illness. makes sense would prevent transmission well vaccine 95% effective preventing infection. turned propaganda. worry, lots people fall it. Initially Wuhan slow report, true. scolded Beijing became aware social media reports. then, wait it, went tried tried true method. what's that? Disappearing veiw, *blaming local regional leaders!""* Exactly said. Here's full story, BBC accept concession. Wuhan everyone tested positive sent quarantine facility.

Take random average person Chad stick Norway, they're almost certainly going deficient.

Ie, Imagine ancestrally place gets plenty sun. Even lighter skin, relatively pretty crap ""Vitamin factory"" would probably still 'good enough' good health. would selection pressure production genetically degraded enough cause problems. gotta always remember, natural selection give shit long reproduction happens. death reproduction negative. problem worries.

Here Tokyo significant part White Collar Workforce “WfH”, create lot new problems challenges! ""central government"" exclusive authority select local leadership. Local leadership voted local government. going pretend understand Chinese governing systems, take fucking moment actually read something. Easily proven false. know much topic, fall CCP propaganda like They’re selling cost. won’t make money round regardless. don’t believe me, check stock prices. Seriously!!!! folks Wuhan now? previously delayed visa beaurautic crap. now. Let us see lab theory supported real evidence rather conjectures made here. taking care sick grandson daughter husband sick. says baby coughed sneezed him, undeniably high risk contact. wife, also helped care sick grandson, vaccinated, get sick. Well they’re going war hands. want noncompliant, forget getting paid countries owe them; seriously, fuck entire world still expect us pay back? Fuck them.

Also, China can’t shit that, need West continue advance civilization, feed ideas. Without US China would nothing. somehow us still got hit harder.. lol. guess 31-6 Saints still hurts :( blind trial work something like this, people receive vaccine expected feel symptoms following days? Heart condition wallet say no. I'll wait line like everyone else 😂 Seven times, took seven times. seen packed rooms get, serious situation Japan. meanwhile, idiots street Tokyo half without mask on, without covering nose.  


Dont misinterpret ""wow japan amazing considerate"" bullshit. It’s crisis here. read today apparently flu transmitted vaccinated people. wired hospital requires masks don’t get flu shot doesn’t do. know “protect” patients. 

Which it? Idk, think it’s pretty dumb. 20% Floridians 65, second highest percentage Maine (and beat us 0.1%, barely). That’s nearly 4.5 million elderly state, vaccines going elderly already live here. Every state getting fair share vaccines reason, wait turn state instead screwing system  literally idea talking about. remarkable little actually know. west can’t say anything nice China. Oh well.  Show us government blamed Wuhan officials keeping beijing dark.

It literally first sentence article sent US intelligence gathered information showing officials Wuhan, China, kept senior officials Beijing dark weeks virus resulted Covid-19 pandemic, according US officials familiar intelligence.

Did even read it? continues Local governance Wuhan includes state officials Chinese Communist Party officials, US intelligence shows even within party, officials freely share information counterparts Beijing, one official said.

This directly disputes claim that, ""everything happened orders central authority."" central authority, Beijing, left dark -- even US intelligence confirms this.

My objective defend CPC, think incredibly important people actually educate they're talking otherwise misinformation spreads like wildfire. I'd much like return normalcy wish government (America) would learn places like China, Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand, etc. terms containment strategies. people like spread bullshit online poison potential that. see stuff like every single day seems thread. favourite guy saying meal could taste fine, bag salt vinegar chips didn’t much taste, something else tasted fine, asked loss taste associated covid could present tastes others. Like dude shitty chips lmao

Another one OP inside window open guy across street coughed asked could exposed covid way. paranoia pandemic given people amazing. Shh racists coming, hide. Sure got wrong January 14th, January 22nd, WTO's mission China issued statement evidence human human transmission. 
Even Dr Fauci got wrong issued statement masks work. Science always evolving new information come light.
However agree initial message Covid-19 chaotic contradictory. ""Cool breakdown, I'm going willfully ignore it""  *The guy got vaccine pharmacist interacts different people everyday.*

Retired pharmacist. forcefully locking whole city? like article quickly switched gears mention allergic reactions. Scary new strain may (or may not) vaccine resistant. Nobody knows we’ll plant little seed doubt scare daylights people. That’ll get clicks. course does. nursing home killer.

More people died NY/NJ anywhere else world thanks psychopath. Thanks

Around time believe likely? Nobody expects Covid walk front door BFF absolutely trust socialize outside bubble, slip HVAC shared housing. mind-body connection huge, expect get symptoms will. Definitely don’t vaccinate children lmao. It’ll probably fine, FDA approved anyone age 16 since trials performed using age range  even bro? replied u/bubowskee alt account talking about? 

Nvm man, I’m done talking children. good one. think reverse. Next time China sends warning, listen it. said authorities knew new year celebrations January would ""accelerate spread virus"". ""People suggested city level shouldn’t go ahead, event would present harmonious prosperous society,"" medic said.

Gotta love business looking good important actually *being* good. doctor/Medical professional Realize it’s giving medical advice. said depends trial protocol. considering signing AstraZeneca trial Utah study coordinator couldn’t confirm would unblinded even dropped out! We’re considering getting pregnant next year want vaccine become pregnant. wouldn’t even unblind drop reason aside SADE ADE. conduct Covid research knew questions ask see possibility getting vaccine post EUA FDA case randomized placebo group and, case, couldn’t guarantee it. course drop point, also weren’t going unblind you. protocol informed consent said would tell 2 year follow up. all, varies clinical trial definitely worth investigating prior enrolling. expect anything more? think everyone kinda expected saints take game lol don’t even know many people covid organ damage, there’s way know anytime soon [It Japan longest life expectancy world, ranking 1 2 consistently. said, health health singling admonition mental health conveniently dodging nations also “accountable” stuff like infant mortality, health bankruptcy etc completely blind bias.

Lots people live within couple hours drive multiple states. fair, it’s gotten bad rap reporting one-sided. Here's key takeaway:

""The **provincial** leaders told hospitals tell truth.""

A lot people like conflate central provincial government. China layers administrative heirarchy likely information accurately getting top. pretty close chinese new year, added pressure downplay virus. similar incident also happened State owned coal firm waited 30 hours inform mine collapse law required matters reported one hour.

A lot people realise China centrally planned locally administered. can't govern large country otherwise. First something probably done student loans. Biden committed canceling $10k federal student loan debt. Second all, federal minimum wage equivalent $22 80s. sandwich equivalent $20. minimum wage going raised $15, that’s valid concern. issue massive bloat corporate profits growth high wage earners average remained flat. final conclusion is, hear teachers, nurses, food service workers sorts workers might earn livable wage longer struggle feed kids first thought that’s unfair you, you’re fundamentally selfish person. developing world going take time recovering increased poverty starvation result global lockdowns. 

Covid always blip radar. went someone Twitter day state. people 25-65 you’re still 5x likely die COVID roads 2019 (the last year posted stats state) agree much covid response “let’s sanitize everything”

It’s hygiene theater. Doesn’t impact outcomes big way. makes people feel better themselves...it’s fucking stupid wife today: “I read today there’s another variant. point, whatever, it’s noise” Thanks, ""Have done research listened podcast anything educate yourself?""

Jesus... Ya us went school understand science ""do research"" reading facebook listening podcasts. stupidity become point pride? Maybe i'd prefer work home large part due really caring socializing work fulfilling socializing needs corworkers, thus would prefer time able socialize friends working home would allow? idea opinion anyway. People different satisfactions ideas approach they'd prefer life. 

It's possible like good liking environment much, that's idea opinion. officials mean BMJ journal, yes, pass peer review published there. Florida openly said vaccinate anyone 65 anywhere. They've vaccinated nearly 36k state. Personally I'm fan means shots arms sooner. woman parked middle aisle, mask sight, phone. said move told ""WAKE UP!"" lol Thing longer circulation likely variant get current vaccine maybe even cause health issues. Yeah now, like 36 states declining cases? Gotta ask...are paid try scare people? Well I’ll vaccinated back normal next month. Meaning I’m still masking, engaging social activities still spread etc. trend continues around another year vaccinated, think going go longer people expect far restrictions go.  Texas give crap, long fat burgers, big trucks, shitty football teams, everything A-ok. Yeehaww 🤠 believe NJ opened access crazy number people last week. It’s chaos get appointment, least people getting vaccine. literally statement put local news Biden already said that's gonna happen. Since order go effect January 26, ain't nothing **EX-President** Trump able it. “Or advertising intellectual issues mask chin” 😂😅 I'm getting pessimistic virus comes closer closer me.

At first, heard someone neighborhood got sick died covid.

Then, one neighbors got sick, died covid.

I found day one best friends parent got covid, waiting get back test results.

So yeah, I'm surprised 2021 2020 part 2: electric boogaloo post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Australia gets Chinese travellers relative population too, go there. agree. Biden-Harris team can't get power soon enough. Even twiddle thumbs, least actively destroying nation.

That said, feel positive make whole lot things great deal better... including getting us vaccine, getting damn disease control.

It frustrating waiting something done long ago. Biden vaccines prevented 2020 turning actual apocalypse.  getting happy end sight mistaking end push end away. Discipline gets us faster.

Some dismal timelines regular Joes like getting vaccine August so. 70-85% heard immunity Yeah it’s strange happened one site makes wonder there’s something else play here. I’m sure sites used lot number.

My clinic hasn’t single anaphylactic reaction almost 4,000 doses given, multiple different lots.  anyone NE ""winter home"" SE.. technically ""qualifies"" (has paperwork) many cities increasing funding police

Because funding placed public services equipped help citizenry. truth, one circumstances police officer ***(in case locally vetted trusted watch)*** right tool problem.

They always. covid perspective it’s smart Biden isn’t going let happen, EU citizen that’s separated American fiancé since February really break heart. Good human. watched crap last Feb said wear masks bad Reddit odds good advice lol  Trump administration nationalize vaccine supply Governors made that. can't cake eat too. rate Pfizer Moderna produce much vaccine there's going supply shortages long time matter anyone does. even, sub may well called /r/maskcirclejerk. help power single handedly stop shit. US already hard problems - enough medical people vaccines even supply. States lletting considering letting everyone eye dr &amp; dentists veterinarians &amp; fire fighters them. getting enough needles vials vaccines, vaccines themselves.


Boris Johnson’s pledge ‘normality’ Easter hit vial supply issues delaying vaccine 100% everyone *can* take it, still know prevents transmission.

I honestly understand what's terrible current restrictions. Viruses smart like terrorists. trying mutate become harmful, rather transmissible less severe immune system reason fight get people sick. also managed beaten back vaccines medicine. Alright. something needs done student loans fact worked ass last decade less deserve.

I want pay $20 sandwich decide eat everyone raise prices pay entry level workers.  Ah, case 99% sub back-of-envelope calculating, possibly-rash assumptions:

There total 23,653,919 recorded cases US ( )

Only 1 7.2 infections recorded cases. (95% CI 6.2 -- 8.5) ( )

Multiplying, estimated 170,308,210 infections occurred US. (95% CI 146,654,297 -- 201,058,311)

The population US presently estimated 330,832,000 . ( ) 

So, estimated number infections 51.47 % total population. 51% slightly half. 

We know epidemics typically follow ""logistic"" curve. (Using assumption past infection confers immunity, least temporarily).  rate new infections increases half population infected, slows vulnerable hosts continue high rate increase. ( )

If estimates true, *the US may passed steepest part curve*. rate-of-increase may already declining, naturally.

And, accounting counts persons vaccinated.  Additional numbers people immune (even partially) would decrease number vulnerable hosts. media can’t report anything complicated “this person said so” shit much travel, normal overlaps spring break. Plus it'll getting warm, get people trying escape snow north. got taste back got jacked ? say win/win assumed trying undermine covid death count based underlying condition argument comparing virus vaccine. that's case, sorry -- argue comparable. One causing deaths backed mountains evidence one, according article, believed causing deaths all. Japan get started vaccination.... looks like face real first major wave. atate also harsh lockdown since Thanksgiving. moment people told cloth masks aren’t good enough months hearing could even better vaccine, nearly everybody trick pretend crank thumb middle finger rolls up. guess Egyptian government exploited ignorance right wing bible thumpers America Americans pay everything them. That’s Israel did. Definitely trying position Presidential run. AZ I'd actually probably working concerts. virus exists continue exist. making anyone lose job extending pandemic way.  Ok point comment? California would've last, biggest state. Wyoming first. Looks like California Governor getting caught breaking rules. liked guy pushing motorized cart. true - look antibody dependent enhancement Volvo Terberg

The ones video perhaps TT 2223-220. Made mistakes...that cost millions lives (and counting) Everyone paid significantly more. Real wages totally flat past 20 years even though corporate profits risen minimum wage substantially lower real dollars years ago. Raising minimum wage net effect raising wages market reacts new competition. Palestinians Palestinian Authority, basically limited government. exercise freedom wear mask like exercise freedom wear pants. freedom ends begins pandemic breath needs contained protect around you. fucking simple. like stay home wear mask. source fearmongering? whole purpose lockdown prevent deaths. immunizing healthcare workers, people 55, immunocompromised people. Attempting stop spread futile... stopping deaths focus get back reality here. [archive link- note entire live update today, 1100 deaths per week. think going 19500 total deaths 24th current going rate.

That's father would've done. Pierre lisping performative like Justy. cant hang there, that's problem. many idiots spreading lot nurses dont care/numb feel like arent/cant much. fiance sister nurses quit go back school over. least 10 nurses know quit leave over. reason would CCP theoretically cremate body researcher hastily? knew created virus, would great help aiding next pandemic destabilize west. releasing concoctions air scramble contain first one. 

Seems fishy knows. soonest people could receive J&amp;J shot? bet final report says it’s Trump’s fault.  great her! different every kid. read posts saying autistic kid thriving home. Coronavirus much infectious (proven flu levels low covid contintues spread

Covid also much deadly. CNN connot control virus mutate could get significant changes milder strains behooves us careful taking action reduce spread variants. longer times variant spread chances mutate. strains one person catches chances share mutations.

It might take estimated month month &amp; 1/2 make new mrna vax bit time test prove safe (even yearly flut tested make sure new vax safe &amp; effective humans) 

Then takes time make enough new vax &amp; get people. get different enough vaccine utterly squandered billions spent current batches vaccines, billions spent getting people worthless mutation one mutation variant makes different vax effect.

After curveballs covid19 thrown humanity think safe rest laurels. Better proactive once, actually track stuff properly areas brakes severe variants take action - finally enforcing mask mandates etc putting place first time. Government would option speed vaccinations areas. There’s little that. CNN task force unanimous recommendation, sent president advance Thanksgiving holiday. sources said Centers Disease Control Prevention strongly opposed reopening travel reckless, especially agency leadership signaling American public domestic holiday travel unsafe.

Crummy. *insert obligatory wait two weeks comment here* Ok, bit background here... forgive simplifications. actually two major types immunity mechanisms: humoral (antibodies) cellular (T cells)

The antibodies, released B cells, major function bind little COVID spikes virus cannot enter cells reproduce. also cellular immunity.

If virus manages enter cell start reproducing, cell spikes poking membrane, point cells react killing cell virus replication happens stimulating immune system.

While variant mutations spikes may somehow reduce binding ability antibodies seriously doubt changed sufficiently prevent recognition cells ability kill cells virus overwhelms immune system.

At worst variant mutations would make vaccinated people contagious suffer mild disease, severe diseases, post infection morbidity (long Covid) hospitalizations/deaths still dramatically decreased

Tl;dr: even antibodies affected mutations still expect vaccines prevent severe disease level.

Once Always much interesting group people chat with. Don’t need take massive amounts prolonged periods time overdose VitD? mean it’s like oops took extra pill today, next day, kidney failure. 

It’s like taking 20 pills everyday months induce type mean? middle schooler trolling around today school? I'm sure people downvoting tbh. 

I making joke username. subreddit linked famously writes posts caps. sure? every time holiday comes along people predicting spike. Im talking Thanksgiving Christmas. Im talking every event takes place calendar: Easter, Memorial Day, 4th July, Labor Day, Halloween etc. Hell claimed increase would happen warmer weather people would want outside colder weather everyone staying inside. Seriously hell last one make sense!? Man, remember late February/early March CDC advised people *not* wear mask unless already coughing sneezing? many stuck people came told masks nothing. needed take plane back home college campuses closed saw one two people wearing mask airport. 

So much misinformation could prevented CDC honest said, ""yeah, masks helpful please hoard need prioritize medical professionals first."" Go U.K. 🇬🇧 I’m sure update vaccine well, can’t get initial hump without adding obstacles it’s exhausting. can’t go another year like marbles. first thought punishment harsh, read told last 7 times. Weeeeellll, play stupid games, win stupid prizes... not.  eradidcated province eradicated everywhere. takes one case suspected appearing province trigger lockdown reached normality anything approximating it. Meh. Even true, I'm sure updated vaccines developed pretty quickly.

The reality COVID probably like flu everyone vaccinated yearly protect new variant.

Covid flu awful. Bullshit medical professionals here, COVID-19 treated hospital? seems promising treatments right now, aside vaccine, determine gets them? I'm scientician seems like is, looked genome data \~2006 figured genetic markers predispose people vitamin deficiency, checked whether markers also predict Covid infection severity.

They actually give anyone vitamin D, test vitamin level anyone. made statistical model try find pattern two things (based genetic data), model show pattern. 

The study title ""Our genetic predisposition vitamin deficiency based model find evidence...."" evidence real world. makes sense. awful strawman argument.

The kinds people partying huge numbers like kinds people equally irresponsible comes precautions. take tests come work next day may infect coworker. take test wait results fly plane. _know_ they're positive straight care still think hoax. ripple effect someone _did_ take precautions getting sick them, infect someone equally reckless on. That's asymptomatic people dangerous right now. 

If taken every possible realistic precaution still got sick, accidentally got others sick, unfortunate, much else could done.

The problem kinds people always either incredibly dumb, give shit, both.  Welcome! case numbers really low. Bingo. Another problem even elderly / at-risk people already vaccinated, return 2019 ways quickly people got vaccine, probably risk virus mutating amongst youth point vaccines work well. vaccines need rolled faster stop distancing/restrictions. Also, talk I've heard far getting vaccines various centres &amp; little part involves people going get individual jabs. going go ZIP code ZIP code basis, alphabetical surname, first come-first serve what? there's marketing convince us (as general public) indeed safe best interest *get vaccine ASAP opposed waiting* till feel comfortable getting it. COVID-19 vaccines sensitize humans antibody-dependent enhanced (ADE) breakthrough infections? unlikely coronavirus diseases humans lack clinical, epidemiological, biological, pathological attributes ADE disease exemplified dengue viruses (DENV). contrast DENV, SARS MERS CoVs predominantly infect respiratory epithelium, macrophages.

Live virus challenge animals given SARS MERS vaccines resulted vaccine hypersensitivity reactions (VAH), similar humans given inactivated measles respiratory syncytial virus vaccines. Safe effective COVID-19 vaccines must avoid they're working blood donation clinic would hope they're handy needle. that's mainly due lack availability, ramp become non-issue move onto next ""phases"" vaccine. feel like going extremely quickly, things considered. It’s pathetic.  well ask haha, nuts fast info covid changed last 8 months. quintessentially NY attitude hate ""we're pretty sure COVID vaccine prevents spreading COVID (or least drastically reduces much spread it), we're sure exact numbers need studies clear picture"" become ""we IDEA COVID vaccine prevents spreading COVID"", became ""the COVID vaccine definitely prevent spreading COVID"". get worst-case scenario dooming lot people past year, regards vaccine, less incentive people actually get it, entirely sure one thing mean opposite said thing true  You’re still cherry picking data.

Trump definitely deserves blame, administration also needs credit setting foundation. Biden almost home; take bit bush whacking, extremely close ending pandemic.

Anyone rough timeline estimate long vaccines widely distributed public gatherings become normal again?

I closely following seems might back ""normal"" around summer? mean...we return normal pretty much 65 age plus people get vaccinated Chicken Pox vaccine! prevents bad case almost cases, even two doses still around 10% develop mild symptoms- considered transmissable. 

Both children fully immunised, daughter caught school friend also immunised, asymptomatic sister (vaccinated) rash. connection otherwise totally different year levels. son caught daughter, luckily came handful spots.

That ""knowingly"" makes huge difference... /r/suspiciouslyspecific Turtles. infinite stack turtles. little old play 'it's you, me' game? awkward thanksgiving.  don't. play. Conjecture without data guessing. It’s better proactive managing risk incomplete information optimistically wrong. US handled pandemic better early instead thinking would “just go away”, less people would died. say so. 🤣 one big issue article me. yo clutch moment there. pretty optimistic. media reports people looking data. 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities concentrated 12-15% population. Estimates 30% population already exposed probably immune. loose ends like long immunity lasts new strains seem completely false worries. already vaccinated 5%, reach 10-15% think things change hurry.

I feel pretty sure Israel turning corner literally like today tomorrow days now. think US UK far behind. Cases continue reported long time hospitalizations fatalities going start dropping. Swiss insist keeping Ski areas open, superspreader locales first wave, drawing whomever wants take risk willing create risk others. US faced two simultaneous crises one pandemic political violence. going conflate two causing many us feel absolutely stressed breaking point simply observing everything happening. That’s little unfair Brits. 

Their surveillance platform enabled us see B117 variant. knowledge accumulated impacts different mutations going make tangible difference.   they’re saying China could acted forcefully? thought people criticizing China forcefulness? China virus sequenced, release data.

Regardless attempt Chinese government control data, US could provided world access genome week earlier chose to. *The report also finds fault countries slow respond evidence COVID-19 cases number countries end January last year.*

""Known cases"" 8% population. would highly surprising US detected 50% cases, likely 25% below, total number infected likely 20% population could well 30%... that's counting vaccinations... haven’t vaccinated yet. Back line me. Idk everyone else, I’m vaccinated I’m gonna stop caring shit. store requires mask I’ll still wear one that’s it. parents really top lockdown stuff, haven’t except go doctors office once, that’s it. even said she’s vaccinated (and she’s high risk hopefully Florida make available soon) shots she’s going finally able relax. I’m happy vulnerable people life besides already gotten first shots, I’m feeling really optimistic I’ll able normal summer year  ThankFul SLAMS rich countries overstocked tests vaccines. hope right. I’ve enough I’m shocked nobody called Tedros step down. World health organizations handling pandemic awful. according 25,000 mutations documented Panic!

Most mutations change anything importance increase decrease severity illness! 

They still useful track spread specific super spreader events

probably important survailance keep eye variants cause problems - infectious changes reduce effectiveness vaccines.

when dangerous variant spotted would know create properly enforce masking measures needed stop spread. would expect authorities would want send vaccine areas possible. Haha, me?? People keep acting like first vaccine ever made. would insane COULD spread covid vaccination one probably many people done couple round trips Europe pandemic, felt pretty comfortable international flights, generally require negative test they're pretty empty.

But domestic flights fucking abomination. Planes every single seat full, test required, much asking feel sick. last flight sat next guy definitely seemed sick heard multiple people trying failing stop coughing. Easy airlines say flights safe way knowing infecting everyone plane. joke. accountability initially trying hide covid start. pound sand make vaccines equitable: make sure mass vaccination sites set places target demographics easy access.

Do throw doses people current priority group present. put people wringer vetting whether deserve priority. Don’t know would exporting enough doses 2% population. Seems best vaccinate first responders, healthcare workers, elderly shipping country. idea do, thank it. Tedros fired replaced someone competent. given vaccines since ask Indian government China wants keep asshole deny Wuhan investigation, I’m going say made damn thing intentionally. 

They clearly hiding something don’t want people make assumptions need confess. CCP bot something? addressing anything said. authority lock CDC Wuhan? local politician sway WHO? answer none. requires central authority. Easier wont result ""disappearance"" dont live totalitarian state. Texanians use Army ICU?

You paid already Army well equipped. missing something? I’m pretty sure it’s proven virus airborn basically survive long enough air went restaurant 2 3 hours last person virus room, likely would catch it. still board. know people keep talking sterilizing immunity. Sterilizing immunity high bar. means virus replicate body all, even little nose. non-sterilizing immunity essentially prevents transmission, example, virus replicates 2 days wiped out, basically never leave incubation period. maybe virus replicates 5 days viral load nose 100x lower unvaccinated case, 100x less infectious. scientists can't say transmission prevented, greatly suppressed. Yes see needed say everyone jump throat downvote you. 

People read original comment thought meant ""no parties theatres events go to"". Usually  think reason seeing kind thought process that, past six nine months, early skepticism severity virus looked back stupidity even maliciousness. far, common people fall heavy social scrutiny assuming virus worse actually is, reverse outstandingly common.

When first Italian study matter indicated half people got virus even display symptoms, lot people saying simply developed symptoms yet. wrong. I'm sure lot examples, would lot controversial, social climate right strongly leaning towards pessimism. Sadly results misinformation unwarranted anxiety.

It's frustrating even understand happening. People like wrong, unless get say ""I hope I'm wrong."" results pessimism seen intelligence. exclusive virus, saddens seems like going become common way simply let past statements, even made context time statement made in, escape individual rest lives. Maybe everyone growing internet, everyone said many stupid things we'll begin accept we're little human make mistakes. It'd nice, even expect it, hey make fun myself- hope I'm wrong. Thank probably good question r/medicine, similar subreddit. hear physicians themselves. Bishops effective long, open diagonals move along. I'm guessing Covid provides effective block movement. Gotta something new afraid of. Can't let go nonstop terror media cash cow. they’re “technically” wrong, dense cases. like I’m looking outside right now, don’t know fact sun isn’t out. considering it’s 11pm east coast US, I’m quite sure it’s not. really hope right tank wagons? Says it’s since May 2020 ...weird couple coworkers literally love clue Guys think vaccine folks might something... One regional politician would terrified inform central power going on.

Every level CPC performs regular, random audits inspections offices lower exactly reason -- regional officers keep things wraps concealed time. known issue there.

All demonstrating slightest idea CPC works regurgitating nonsense read elsewhere. Educate yourself; far better use time instead blindly spreading misinformation online. What? mean won’t cured future versions get today? sorry hear that. can't imagine greece would fair well probably running really low funds bankruptcy, near halt international tourism, something greece heavily relies on. store somebody pushes refusing wear mask refuses leave call police ask remove somebody trespassing. Never problem, it’s private property, different somebody won’t leave house. Well, data would suggest government incorrect. hey, I'm great position pass judgments another country's handling pandemic. country's current government believes massive hoax, either stymie economy rational reason, forcibly implant microchips/nanobots population monitoring and/or mind control. Americans intelligent -- there's 74 million us reeeeally pulling average. Preventative medicine interesting making history.  know fuck reading, everthing I've read far basically calling spade spade spades Cuomo DeBlasio. cpl blaming Trump federal government rightfully elected officials held standards. federal government supposed lead way administrations defense states told responsible individual roll distribution. states failing miserably, NY one them. Vitamin necessary regardless specific research, people (especially winter) deficient. taking anyway. 

Make sure take something fatty since vitamin one four fat soluble vitamins. 

You also try take vitamin D+K supplement vitamin K helps ensure absorb much vitamin D. Hope stays way!!! FDA saying massive surge infecting many many vaccinations happening see things slow around end February based lack easy paths spread. keep much longer agree standard traveller rules like mandatory 2 week quarantine, negative tests. 
Not risk local population also other! Many already exposed suffering covid, eg French president. I've read different antibodies nose ones blood may may created vaccine presence dictates whether exhale virus spread others. 2 months still can’t smell

Took around 6-7 months get sense taste &amp; smell back order. It'll come back. entirely different experiences everyone. friend got mostly back weeks. Well said. people think impossible know *anything* make conjecture without incredibly rigorous expensive scientific research, ""ignoring science"". 

I've calling ""we KNOW"" crew.  poorest countries “low” number bc theyre testing even tracking deaths scale... bc they’re actually better Viruses mutate different rates depending virus may able get new strains faster. helps virus successful infecting people animals increase mutations. Minuscule number people vaccinated far, Covid might resistant it. Seriously? wait MLK Jr.'s Day numbers come in!  Umm quite. vaccine response far robust without memory cell fuckery know covid hamper future antibody response years road. zombies come us? Paywall, fuck shit! recall that. opening act Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. drove old vw bus. thought really old then, little girl. makes sense. I'm glad people work ethics science spent time thinking have. point is, there’s plenty people would downvoted hell suggesting similar “what could done” arguments different letter besides name. know that’s like, though inflammation caused different virus. That’s definitely fun. It’s terrible woken aching pain move. doctor recommended supplements help reduce inflammation well, help little bit addition pharmaceutical anti-inflammatories. inflammation still sucks. 

Again, really hope get sorted start waking feeling good pain. I'm aware. I'm also aware totalitarian state. One regional politician would terrified inform central power going on. I'm also foolish believe local official going sway WHO. top brass CCP peddle ""no human transmission"" nonsnese. also top brass locked CDC refused allow investigations Wuhan. Please try pretend local Governor power. comes top.  look Spanish flu, brought socialized healthcare. Maybe bring personalized healthcare. probably track health closely devices. may choose respect others taking preventative measures sick higher risk area.

 bet 50 years, movie this.  Well hey I’m fan Cuomo supposed do? Order people stay hospital test cleared? enough beds. Put tents outside? takes care them, kind special tent frail nursing home patients? medical cruiser coast wasn’t set population either. menu bad choices given chose one. really don’t see options had. 

Now, go back bit further- deblasio hook downplaying inevitable. never charge. employer absolved responsibility anyone got sick. “If get sick it’s wearing PPE incorrectly,” said management. management team couldn’t last 45 minute meeting without griping masks.

If get sick, see lawyer sue asses next Tuesday. Write date said this, record witnesses. Funny. get flu vaccine every year I've never gotten flu. He’s really blame nyc getting hit hard. It’s type city never going well kind virus. 

But blame nursing home fiasco vaccine rollout. course whole book thing great job gross.  Agreed, another reason me. life without commute every day would nicer me.

That said see, lot people super invested idea coming office hate idea WFH consistent acceptance WFH pandemic. 

But know what, whatever works anyone. people invested idea coming office, good. not, good. Blame shifting. Thank response. think it’s important gather data.  Wtf talking say ""chin diaper"" Japanese? La throwing away thousands day? hitting 5k confirmed cases day state 7M people. starting come saturating vulnerable population. people stay home exposed, people covid fatigue, people limited exposure etc. religious precautions staying protected reach saturation point folks &amp; about, getting unlucky. It’s also genuinely difficult get coronavirus functioning NYC places US article:

“Extraordinary times calls extraordinary efforts ask begin actively manage supply week week basis, let vaccines sit shelves,” Polis wrote letter, adding providers retain enough second doses week Jan. 18-25.

The state said immediately freeing 20,605 doses Pfizer vaccine 19,120 doses Moderna vaccine total 39,726 doses; state would backfill additional second doses needed coming weeks doses expected arrive, Polis wrote. 

News new guidance hospitals vaccine providers come three days Polis said “shocked lied to” [after learning stockpile reserve Health Human Services secretary promised earlier last week would soon released.

The expected shipment around 230,000 doses would likely allowed half people age 70 receive first shot end week, Polis said news conference Friday. ridiculous notion ‘bubble’ USA riddled virus. either isolating practicing social distancing aren’t. Assuming cold weather keeping people home role Wait heart lung disease numbers kick ""mild"" cases. Yes one people. got offered jumped knew scarce going be. Plus watched Dr Fauci get shot confirm safe. really wish important members society would tv.  service industry collapsed. Restaurants part of. small minority.
And still manufacturing, shipping banking. 3 bring money city.  Lmao entire next paragraph pretending suggest things know nothing *actually* work. Colorado Damn wrong. Thank correct information. sorry, tough shit. nations used tax payer money fund development vaccines going shipping overseas populations vaccinated. 

They call ""moral failure"" want, nations require aid charity going last places get vaccine. Man quit smoking.. time start again? Lol Definitely bad luck. 

I devastated. felt like whirlwind nightmare catching covid, watching others party socialise without catching thing. Surge capacity already maxed out. issue much ""beds"" (you always create more) lack trained staff care patients them.

Fortunately, things seem plateaued past week, still early tell we've really turned corner. medical field isn’t government service US. People voting socialized healthcare decades. isn’t enough medical military staff cover missing gaps either. always fan cone ice cream anyway like people want argue vaccine “so rushed” really going endure 3+ years wearing masks, social distancing, mass gatherings, constant lockdowns felt like enough time passed vaccine properly developed 🤣.

I like see solution would end pandemic quicker 🧐 I'm thinking mandated forever, would preferred consistent unified messaging convince enough public choice long time ago instead forcing preferable. rampant spread virus mutations generation virus potential acquiring threatens success vaccine putting end immediate future. need people just... try... spread months. There's many people never even tried, nevermind people tried getting sick it. idea. mind Germany prejudices foreigners skin colour also high people talk much less it. Like corruption high well people like pretend big problem countries, is. people accept talk less less open it, especially foreigners. felt random wrote it, broke tooth biting peanut butter granola bar weeks ago, neighbor got Puerto Rican food delivered yesterday. Subconscious mind action. family except brother tested positive Covid 18 Jan 2021. Exam ( must present exam centre attend) 22nd Jan cannot postpone. 

Is possible attend exams ? stay quarantined? new form diplomacy ... getting goodwill cheaper F16. meaning original comment cannot say - something happen happen shortly vaccine. ADE could take months/years show itself, data sufficiently say problem going forward. Unlikely, still something talking part informed decision making process consenting vaccine. Downvoting something plenty literature seems bit silly? course, ship sailed first charges alloted elsewhere. nothing intentional current slow speed. Honestly, much room improvement two. Interesting, I'd always thought survive long surfaces, suppose applies inorganic surfaces.

Feeling bit safer veggie now! like work shopped comment PMing multiple times sad sad little man.

Enjoy block fucking weasel.  I'm CoNvULsIoNs!!! HeLp CaNt StOp! Stop lying people give cheap Chinese vaccines. survive it, you’re 50% protected! big problem lot time get caught they'll move different accounts, internet's still wild west lot senses Bavarian state pledged provide 2.5 million free charge people need.

If works good financial support students Corona crisis, lot covered already huge financial stress. 100 fucking percent. think much healthy school lunches need happen. schools literally gotten rid recess. Like play time. Active time children. horrible. Though kids may carry virus, chances getting **super sick** low. Extremely low. still good step right direction!! Healthy food options! eat damned vegetables!!

There plenty good steps one get healthy. simple thing would take good supplement blood work done see deficient. *know* vitamin deficient, take supplement. help immune system, take C NAC supplement too. per dietitians recommendations, dr run blood tests tell deficiencies. even avenues get full spectrum blood test done *cheap* dr give recommendations.

Another would walk mins every day. Simple things like little bits exercise go **LONG WAY!!**. nerve damage injury air force limits mobility - bad get worse. try stretch walk bit stairs give bit exercise. cant much, *something*.

You see affect health making good choices? dont **perfect**, dont wanna get sick, dont give body ability get sick. things cant prevents, general health **ALWAYS** good thing!!

There plenty healthy things anyone strengthen immune system. Simple changes - people dont wanna change. wanna able eat like shit, dont get right vitamins, dont sleep rest enough, stress body like crazy, barely exercise **STILL** get sick.

It doesnt work. Gotta take care human body machine. machine, needs good fuel constant care.

Oh according girlfriend registered dietitian - pop tarts, even though say fortified vitamins minerals box, **not** substitute good nutrition. dont get means though, literally strawberries package strawberries fruit.🤷‍♂️ check definition Herd immunity also India population. We've boat San Diego. opened 75 year-olds today enough healthcare workers signing up. agree. guy tremendous job except started talking Civil Rights Act ADA.

It simple as, ""Corporate instructed us deny entry anyone refusing wear mask, legal authority so. also told ask anyone creating disruption either store parking lot vacate premises.""

If refuse leave, say calling police, security cameras recording faces car license plates, refuse leave asked, leave police arrive, store press charges local authorities.

Back old days, retail stores very-public signage warning shoppers trespassers prosecuted -- wanted make clear matter minor theft was, would pursue it, general deterrant. think situations like this, extra step may needed, since police come stores, stores go police provide evidence prosecute people trespassing. Let idiots go actual judge try make nonsensical legal arguments ADA CRA require stores let without masks. Let judge prosecutor disabuse crackpot legal theories learned dumbass Facebook post. blind test group? people scientific setting allowed mix general population trial? get vaccine rushed through, get it’s entirely man made vaccine, get time constraints really do..but isn’t usual clinical trials going background. controlled environments. could data used test subject could effect contract types viruses? Maybe people UK trying cheer distraction terrible mishandling pandemic Anyone know vaccine timeline state state US? mean, google lmao. research ongoing general consensus. he’s making medical advice make claims.
 

But did.  “As goodwill gesture, government planning send Covaxin Mongolia, Oman, Myanmar, Philippines, Bahrain, Maldives Mauritius,” said senior official, part meeting. “Covishield sent Bhutan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Seychelles,” official added.

Very kind. need countries this. good news! use nicotine patches treat narcolepsy I’ve done 7 years (never smoker). still got whacked pretty moderate case covid :( Austria both... ""hard"" lockdown skiing allowed, lifts open, albeit max half capacity. Yes. like flu mutations don’t make flu vaccine useless lockdowns China. complete lack transparency early stages pandemic, that's damage. interest discussing btw. Bye die hospital makes sense. Dude same. Wtf never ending body aches. drives mad Seriously? hospitalized actually recover? Idk really thought didn’t. Hoooooo boy. There’s lot unpack here...but let’s burn whole suitcase instead.

All depends vaccines. 7 day averages. looks like may starting go down. 

It's chart right middle page Collapse? Doubt it. Nah, city vaccine drives now, literally anyone wants get poked. I'm stuck 2 week quarantine, bet ass I'll next one do. least areas handling vaccine rollout well see major surges.

Also, area seen major surge since August. GF works Heart Hospital, hospital system send patients months. I'm wondering earlier surges bad enough slow spread considerably here. Right takes couple weeks kick in. get 2nd dose like 50%, next two weeks go 95%. could still get guess unlucky, probably milder case get it. Nice. Dammit! (I live Richmond.) 

This kind positive reinforcement need life.

Breweries ""Shots Shots"" show commitment assisting helping community get back normalcy. article say new variants making vaccines ineffective.


It says something scientists keeping eye could theoretically happen. It’s likely not.

You willfully interpreting read way severely distorts said way justify depressive worldview.  Yes, I’m agreeing you, vaccines past take longer. bearing ones, circumstances wildly different. Things moved on. infinite money available time, well high incidence target virus testing completed (to standards previous vaccines meet) fast.

Stop spreading disinformation. One day (for - GMT+1) loose inspiration gave us stuff like this..

This garbage. piss jars save drinking water smell farts don’t escape atmosphere. EXACTLY Uh, April (Or maybe early May?), mass Serology showed NYC reached 20% population infected first wave.

Most early Serology studies shitty cause done people places virus prevalent. government give shit health. I’ve said threads basically: things aren’t going back 2019 normal things net positive people dont disrupt lives: work home flexibility despite definite return (think bosses would’ve made someone use sick time allowing work home sick), better hygiene practices. think people think using sanitizer washing hands using bathroom. think countries like US build better sick time jobs rather force people come work sick, time spent outside, eating areas outside, engagement outdoor activities outdoor vacations, better ventilation homes businesses (opening windows doors leaving open more) things don’t disrupt society.

What’s going stay gone events, gatherings, parties, full stadiums, weddings, funerals, live theater, concerts. things humans crave, work for, save for, live for. Banning things like live entertainment gatherings social creatures like humans leads humans seeking outlets events bring. Ultimately you’d end backyard hidden theater performances live music. can’t stop things taking place goal get back open. certain point hospitals aren’t risk overflow, personal risk assessment back table decide don’t want participate again. Kinda weird Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland listed separately. Especially UK also listed. Especially they've ""all"" approved vaccines anyway (can one even approved individually anyway?) Exactly. It’s political stunt. April complaining federal govt needs coordinate buying individual states. wants buy own. trump told sky blue would disagree. citizen resident Australia? No? talking things clearly clue about. literally island international boarders. worry issues rather made ones you’ve created That's great. one chain area pick-up, hard get slot, also stores open in-person shopping. Irresponsible headline. They’re saying it’s possibility haven’t proved hasn’t. That’s science works. chances requiring new vaccine extremely low. Like &lt;.01% chance low.

Work wants two consecutive negatives 24 hours apart

I say mild cough week so. Lost taste middle last week. 

Zero symptoms. Vaccines Comparison data, derived US trial would enough allow original regimen approved. really slowed insane delay getting Phase 3 US trial ground.   Says lunatic wants entire world quarantine rest time. ""Everyone selfish going way avoid getting sick!""  jumpsuit makes look fat. That's says here. God can’t fucking stand every single new variant reported it’ll change course pandemic. blatant fearmongering media I’ve lost much respect lot news outlets loved past. think mostly supply issue. FFP2 mask available everywhere weeks ago. getting common available many shops. seems like deja-vu me. Like governments EU states (say Hungary, Poland, Italy sometimes) shifting entire blame failures/shortcomings Brussels. Best way run responsibility find perfect scapegoat. There's surprising number Japanese folks pro-Trump, they're also usually ones pro-Abe since LDP pretty right-wing lot US would consider neo-con. What's S-dropout mean?  important wrong people get getting herd immunity quickly possible. everyone knows that.  Seems like kidding vaccine cure many getting vaccinated every day infected. provide single source that? find one Thank you. Thank kindness caring. ❤ It’s called providing source. think less 1,000 people going walk away without long-term damage, that’s pretty ignorant. Damn, imagined people leaving prison 2020 finding covid measures etc don’t roll joints blunts, that’s inefficient use weed, can’t say sure. Probably 1 blunt. 8th 3.5 grams usually lasts month nearly daily toking. gram get high maybe 5-10 times depending well ration it. also easily use once. Sure, bird jump cliff wing healing, yet healed, still fall death.

Rejoice, inside, people live wear mask go beyond wall. lot mental health issues myself, excuse, shit even regret saying it. No... wouldnt call unlikely. would rather tend towards probable

I often blunt - 

The statement wrong matter angle look it. wrong wrong.

Take look compare numbers EU US example: 

 [List killings law enforcement officers country - 

I think guys need rethink gun laws bit. You’re angry reason. lot groups don’t submit vaccination numbers holidays, doesn’t mean don’t vaccinate all.  Maybe mixte people natural immunity + vaccines + vulnerable died isolated. numbers still horrendous . It’s absolutely politician thing. That’s letter made public. doubt would buy let knows won’t. March 2020: federal government lets states sort PPE. Cuomo: bullshit. can't let states buy supplies.

January 2021: federal government coordinates vaccine distribution. Cuomo: bullshit. Let states buy supplies.

At point political posturing.  Israel also population smaller London. Sure Israel done fantastic job give UK credit. amazing done government have. Yet people sub still praise China lockdowns. fair want trust US' COVID counts, trust China's need educated world. fucking bizarre right man. Perhaps straight bad luck? dunno. Personal anecdote I’ve known people shitheads since beginning numerous exposures close calls somehow haven’t caught it. It’s weird. meanwhile non EU country (UK) sitting near 5% vaccinates fuck sakes. EU killing us here, forcing lockdowns even bothering keep vaccinations. Hope correct, although wife (KY health dept RN), read article well Comments. first thing noted ‘wonder folks longer wanting get tested’. observation makes sense degree many people traveling reasons. great hopeful note make! Legit sat car crying last Monday 6 code day. 10% survival rate ICU right now. patient yesterday birthday. FaceTimed wife intubated him, knew he’s never coming tube. he’s 3 weeks in, full-on bilateral pneumonia, he’s literally dying already. I’m far past burnt point. Easter school force come in? online lessons account got hacked said rude stuff. telling i'm allowed work home, go in. refuse? allowed to? Good.

How people get this? fully believe kids vaccinated fall. probably better define mean “great shape” schools. There’s good chance kids still distanced inside schools, maybe still wearing masks, definitely still using lots hand sanitizer hand washing. bigger risk schools always danger presented teachers, aides, bus drivers, lunch ladies, etc. worry kids spreading school taking home elderly immunocompromised family members. people vaccinated know kids less likely spread Covid, schools continue follow protocols say, quarantine classroom positive cases, overwhelmingly school would look much better right now. hopefully virtual hybrid would distant memory (or used aforementioned quarantine periods). ordered enough Pfizer vaccines half population June. (Set approved February) However, want vaccinate 80 percent population July definitely need approve another vaccine. may june 2030 maybe. US pretty clearly capable anything close saying. we're getting hoping anything good happening. don't. know lot areas give shots Sundays and/or holidays. mean get day fucking pandemic.

It make feel little better 23 states given least half shots 40 given least 40%. already said supply constrained couple said they've booked appointments entire supply. one two soft days probably matter. Soon we're going need big uptick supply.  Yeah

The idea get vaccines readily available get suppressed enough threat average person negligible go back normal largely ignore like flu 

Not completely wipe much this. annoyed sitting around France looking Americans bitching vaccine distribution abysmal - 4,5 doses given per hundred people 0,7.  Tbh, live AZ much pause I’m glad someone balls kick people out.  many stores “require” masks enforcement policies. believe you. Many post factually incorrect, giving false sense hope leading people naive ignorant pandemic  Could expand obesity part? control group study. don’t want bet. want follow data aggregate understanding virus killing hundreds thousands affecting millions. want listen scientists heed advice public health officials. Understanding it’s perfect work progress, one goal keeping safe possible. I’m one poorest countries Europe although bordering countries EU started vaccination still haven’t received single vaccine. Sucks poor. got second dose last week. mild headache fatigued 18 hours later lasting 10 hours. Symptoms coworkers ranged nothing 48 hour fevers chills. Seems like sort symptom roulette. What...

I said I’ll going without mask June...  Yeah gyms *feel* wrong need sacrifice people's well-being livelihoods theater. 10% Iowa already infected that's half-assed testing knows about

So entirely possible there's enough immunity general population hastening vaccines pushing pandemic LOL. strict lockdown measures California. happens entirely unrelated a, let's say Spanish, real lockdown. called prejudice. Whiteness social construct, opposite blackness put context, several studies post ICU stroke patients showed similar rates rehospitalization death:

1) looked study particular match controls, good. problem describe severity disease study participants, ICU vs. non-ICU. appears hospitalized general, bearing prognosis based study. Years? I'm hoping vacinated June clear sarcastic?..since two states every old person goes winter... reports says cases declining 36 states past week. don’t care lol don’t follow hockey fuck team want play, play. number schools including Duke's women's team (but men's team) already cancelled seasons.

If think risk high, one forcing compete. force people willing accept risk want play sit you. I’m weed smoker. much gram many joints roll that? I’m sorry genuinely believe that, might wanna look resources area could help you. Oh, look... assholes who've assholing since start pandemic! Surprise, suprise!!! felt little tired next day first dose you’ll fine, unless lot manual labor. Wow 😂 hope helped release pressure inside skull. data answer conclusively quite people side expect significant reduction “If vaccine that’s 95 percent effective reducing symptoms, universe wouldn’t also reduce likelihood transmission. It’s possible,” said. “So we’re talking whether reduces transmission not, want get extent virus hits immunized host, dead end. Even immunized people become asymptomatically infected shed virus infect unvaccinated people, unlikely would result transmission another vaccinated person. typical virus behavior.  prediction one last bad winter surge, start slowly getting better Spring Summer Fall we're almost back normal. There's also 3 vaccines coming Johnson Johnson, Oxford, Novavax. said reach Pfizer buy vaccine directly. Long shot knows.  say think vaccinate many people fast possible, think least start see pretty significant drop deaths strong coverage nursing homes + elderly. Herd immunity? people taking care now? think largely selfish fault, suppose there's one good thing massive social media documentation. go sort testing see Japan exceptionally bad testing. can't get test unless confirmed Covid-19 interaction creates catch-22 due random testing. Well, UK little bit densely packed US. Poland currently trajectory vaccinate everyone 5 years. Eat Oklahoma!  Would go far say unlikely?
(I going say inaccurate; given context seemed poor taste. poor taste mention tho.) would surprise hear announcements literally Thursday morning. think good staff they've planning months. Sounds like touch pharma companies, ""warp speed"" people, state governors, CDC, already. know everyone's top issue.

The ""vaccinate 100M people 100 days"" really kind soft ball target hope that.

The hold vaccines really state local level. Biden limited ask Congress money. probably influence CDC involved there, say CDC holding back. Simply communicating consistent high level strategy help itself. Well said.. sire must saddle horses head holy land Back threats prayers death. delusions said say. people think like paragons rationality?

You're tearing apart nothing. feel free pretend are. What's one delusion add pile? speak Sweden get significantly vaccine doses week march forward. Like 5x now. Something like 500k week, 2 million month. population 10 million words, next time pandemic hits, we're getting lockdowns nothing else. related masks, airborne spread. So, I've looked various articles airborne spread, I'm looking small indoor aerosolized covid particulates become they've reached stage. thing I've found smaller 5 microns. virus usually .125 microns, always carried larger vessel. general consensus small respiratory aerosols become completely evaporate, mask protect smallest form ?

I've found masks, surgical masks, N95s, KN95s electrostatically charged, aiding filtering. question regarding P100 cartridges(for half-face respirator) electrostatic aforementioned types masks? Thanks, anyone answer. would greatly appreciate it. could make backyard care, there’s backlog orders, getting actual vials stock won’t happen time ones *already ordered* state distributed. sound like mental issues. can't imagine anybody sane FuN! 

I’m sure fun someone stay inside house another years lmao.  think even 100 days tough sell. Jan 20 May 1. point out, past 10 months one long 30 day lockdown.

I think real question happen order start let restrictions. hope decline hospitalizations fatalities necessarily decline cases. Illnesses concentrated elderly vaccinated illnesses drop way even still cases. like 2 kids farting x# kids sit piles shit make colossal deal 2 kids. thought meant actual drug class known immunosuppressants. type drug transplant patients need take order prevent organ rejections. thought may missed something new weight lifting world! moving across country. 76 yr old husband get first shot Saturday. (And hopefully following week.)

Do need get second shot flying new state? soon first shot consider safe go? Biden reversing Trump's UK travel restrictions lifted.

&amp;#x200B;

 first patient patient one. Ordinals start one.    Shit doesn’t even work more, stains shirts. Like permanently ruins pits. 

Deodorant way. Lol federal cosmetics law updated since 1938 would get freedom trampled spitting stick? Also people generally property pay taxes contribute local economy 6 months spend year. don’t really much issue those. People travel get shot don’t connection state much controversial. Also snowbirds, living Florida winter isn’t reasonable expect travel back state residence get shot 3-4 weeks later.

The main issue would snowbird population factored distribution allotment state receives federal government. last updated December (looks like two different December dates cdc site). Could easily 100m point. Israel got 3.8 billion aid last year they're vastly wealthy country. 35th richest GDP per capita. really seen biden effect covid plan vaccinate 100 million 100 days...he really office. responsible, take covid seriously, also live life fun. doom gloom like sub makes be.

You can. problem still really know virus spreads, there's objective level ""taking COVID seriously"" that's ""enough"". example, California instead Florida, able go Universal Studios eat restaurant. Many people allow travel around druthers. 

By definition, think responsible. that's deep I’d curious see video article could provide showing encouragement. President Trump ( I’m fan ) ( dislike politicians ). suck. Closed borders US day guys Feb 1st believe. maybe wrong. March 11th, Politicians New York California go TV encourage Dinning out. Also weeks publicly saying shut downs China “racist “. Shortly later hundreds thousands taking streets protest civil rights simultaneously running articles evidence spreading transmission.  Around time Trump holding rallies ( stupid ) media tearing apart transmission possibilities. switched outdoor gatherings didn’t stop criticism. point is, maybe shed clarity this- America crazy divided politically. Politics sadly drove many people believe one way other. left believed science fit narrative. right disregarded it. strangely high density outbreaks Democrat ran cities. doesn’t seem case Australia, seems sides isle pit differences aside times media same? early data israel seems confirm drop hospitalizations transmission vaccinated groups. flu heart disease. win. comment deleted sure replying to, try nice possible (and report rule-breaking comments). Thanks! 100%- best friend also medical student intents purposes, doesn’t seem different classmates. It’s spend ungodly amount time studying I’ve started pick “I’m okay right now” cues. 

As society, really need re-imagine illness looks like often pain conditions ignored people look “normal.” AFAIK, even 50,000 units/day hurt you. sure long term.  truth there. - September 1993 That's 33.7 100,000 infected, that's total population. would normalize rate pediatric infection study period understand true risk. Hear, hear! want ship Pfizer vaccine Mali, South Sudan Eritrea? countries cold storage fully control chomping bits? Whaaaaaa?!?  smell rock cooking See, that's actually really funny, public good might want save couple months. Yes, basically tested whether deficiency negative effect rather whether surplus positive effect. indirect since based genetic predisposition, might indicate actual vitamin levels. you! complain Who? Baba O’Riley kind Wizard? transfer student America Palestinian Authority want vaccines Israel, prefer buying Russian vaccines. 
Palestinians living Israeli authority vaccinated like everyone else. guns zygotes? /s personal anecdote =/= data DP also skewed older population too! Asymptomatics tend younger, especially children hope tomorrow like ""CASES SPIKING!!"" Cause eventual backlog. Pretty sure sustainable downswing tho! talking implementing long-term lockdown measures? US never comprehensive lockdown anyway. 50% lockdown couple months. never know 75% lockdown period would achieved never happened.   Trump terrible mean give politicians pass mistakes. 

PS: Also, maybe rational, fact many people think Cuomo handled well makes annoying me. Everyone knows Trump fucked royally, somehow Cuomo became hero despite much better. basically got pass speak complete sentences unlike Trump. Click article  Maybe was. 

Plan implementation date : April 1992 Interesting post. know, country don’t wear mask exercising presumably oxygen, didn’t think hyperventilating rebreathers remedy though. seems government (Queensland, Australia) thinks masks cause issues oxygen levels  bunch non believers...more vaccines actually used good eyes. Coca khat chewers same, socially stimulated. What's left TBD prevents spread. definitely effective preventing serious illness. probably often effective preventing infection entirely (hard tell infection asymptomatic). know helps people pass person person. Hopefully so, though! Based even basic understanding grammar, ""they"" context would referring two individuals referenced original post (NYS govener Cuomo NYC mayor Deblasio).

The daily death count higher ever want everything back normal again? Dude I'm sorry dumb. Also pretty dick thing give fuck people dying realizing people like we've prolonging quarantine. 
Here's science, virus really good evading immune system, know effective immune response preventing infections capacity spread others (basically know long antibodies last). they're asking still infected still get vaccinated, know vaccine induce strong enough immune response. Therefore, infected, mean can't spread it. take type guy call BS, think help further. Likewise, we're tired dumbfucks social distancing attacks FrEeDoMz.

Lidl good shit tho. sources lacking information. causal link established vaccine deaths. Please read detailed easy virtue signal internet. Vaccines cost money. Lots money. biggest economic players world, ones capable bankrolling astronomical task, paid it. think reality exists would've done promised doses? Stop living idealistic fantasy come reality. Yes, world unjust place. I'm sure want anyone it, give vaccines countries (a monumental task, especially countries extensive supply lines like US) let economy crumble permanently vaccinate every old person every third world country? potato soup plastic microwavable cup unreasonably good. Yeah. cool China initially tried hide little bit, still told world early enough still plenty could've done. countries chose jack shit. criticized Cuomo NYC sub, called right wing troll. think that’s eased bit lately, impossible even conversation it. People vaccinated long enough make claim.

Cases generally start coming two weeks vaccination, hospitalisations deaths would take month.

Israel terrible outbreak last month (at worst point, equivalent 300,000 cases per day US), surprise lots people testing positive getting vaccinated. people would infected vaccine chance give protection, even got vaccination (remember there's delay week catching virus showing symptoms).

You could one-shot vaccine produced 100% immunity, stop people testing positive caught virus chance induce immune response. Sure may reduce transmission mean can't spread virus, assume enough data. time, easily reached herd immunity vaccination, irrelevant. Literally talking months difference first vaccinated vs last vaccinated given country part. 

Point since confirmed, really hard keep masking couple months vaccinated give everyone chance? conclude study misleading, even whole world. least experience kinda shitty supermarkets ones people wear better ones cashiers wearing even behind plastic windows. knew last year...but thanks same. norm really. Saves company money long run good PR. Antibodies component immunity  Man.

Edit: Woops! pill-based vaccine, anti-viral pill continue take like PrEP. case entire pandemic, reason smaller gatherings larger driver spread random healthy dude walking past supermarket ten seconds without wearing mask.

Nursing homes usually high turnover rates typically understaffed. would create new problem.  kind wonder though could also partially biased loss smell obvious would immediately go get tested. far know, common signs covid fever, cough, sore throat, shortness breath. symptoms common every cold, flu whatever virus, symptoms slight form might go get tested. 
But loss smell quite unique Covid, people experiencing symptom get tested lots people also mild Covid, without loss smell get tested lost statistics? EU chooses display timelines based ordered vaccines approved, Canada, UK, EU countries like Germany based timelines approved vaccines, ones haven’t proven work yet plain haven’t received regulatory aporoval. pfizer, first vaccine used israel Oh yeah. peak cringe right there.

Hospitalizations? one brain saying US would herd immunity mid 2020 tf u asking  ""hug Chinese"" campaign Italy happened February?  


I'm ethnically Chinese, still think pretty dumb. know federal health authorities never bothered set national surveillance system detect variants spread. 

The absence evidence evidence absence case, mean spread Arizona, there's surge 3k per day second wave, think reinfections cases. There's lot going on, way 60% 2,4 million population Manaus gotten first wave, second wave entire families getting time. anyone gone one vaccine trials, actual experience like? chance get novavax one. 

If participated trial, wait lot others generally exposed lot people process? sounds silly I’m worried vaccine, I’m afraid catching covid environment I’d go order participate. think less issue sub issue type headlines news putting out. would sub issue saw one type headlines excluded. news media issue mostly publish two types headlines know generate clicks. click read article even dire hopeful headline made sound Feigl nutritionist much business making claims determining implications paper doctor internal medicine. authors regarding findings paper Fiegel cites:

""But biggest priority vaccinate! Despite above, I'm confident current vaccines useful quite while. Reasons: (a) even worst mutations (ie, E484) erode neut activity sera, eliminate any, (b) current vaccines elicit strong immunity (c) evidence animals (&amp; humans 1st vaccine dose) modest immunity blunt disease, (d) natural immunity seasonal CoV provides homologous protection 3+ years even though evolve too.""

So Feigl wrong. states, yes. states system amount paid sick leave based amount hours work. example, state, Vermont, entitled 1 hour sick leave per 52 hours work (this lowest ratio states heard of, give 1 hour per 30 hours). amount caps 40 hours Vermont, though.

Lots room improvement, better absolutely laws place.

Unions also lot pull industries well, generally protect average cashier trying get by. course alone , polio vaccine absolutely captain ship. 10% population infected. Health workers already working hard, right even worse. Everybody describing war-like scenario. enough ventilators go around they're forced decide gets live doesn't.

Plus people probably likely expose risk. mean Manaus immunity study reported Nature, let’s hope wildly wrong we’re seeing first infections surging now. confusing hypothesis fact.

**Hypothesis**: hypothesize vaccinated people cannot spread covid.

**Fact**: currently unknown vaccinated people still spread covid.

In case, acting untested unproven hypothesis potentially maim kill people.

Scientists attempt substitute ad hominems scientific debate. Yep weird tingling tongue tastes smoke randomly. Pfizer claiming 50.7% efficacy dose 1, hence reason 2 dose vaccine. Whereas Moderna's closer 80% dose 1. ""reduced efficacy"" possibly explained behavior individuals post disease 1. Exactly. great news moves people list, expense idiots vaccine program goes well we’re lockdowns sooner mainland Europe I’ll consider win.

As withdrawal agreement. haven’t read I’m assuming it’s one page saying “everything stays trade deal”. think I’m arguing semantics, I’m not. end January 2020 stopped EU members. Could that’s benefit able procure vaccines faster still EU.

Oh program nothing getting better prices negotiated block. France wanting action Sanofi vaccine. Unfortunately shit bed one. And?? spoke white people? I'm talking western nations wealthy ones happen ones profited centuries genocide, enslavement colonialism nations (including mostly white nations like Poland Ukraine). can't wear mask cold?

you can! want mandates. this, people would look funny millenia human evolution hard-wired us wary someone whose face cannot see. Even China committing vaccine African continent related business ties. They've funding projects Africa many years build relationships governments there. constitution China, clarifying misunderstanding local government structure. http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/englishnpc/Constitution/2007-11/15/content_1372989.htm trying say it’s pretty clear point COVID-19 cause ADE  expect reopening May barring loss immunity significant way new strains(even 50 percent get reinfected, largely mild that's short term issue). mean again, going historically illiterate don’t try argue position contemporary morality.

King L2 private individual never stepped foot Congo personally, modern state Nigeria isn’t responsible individual actions mercenary’s “west” isn’t responsible actions private enterprise Congo free state. Yeah thankfully guessed correctly placebo made sure stay safe. never got sick got benefits trial without actually tested haha Lol they’re gonna slowly drive past us we’re bars cars alone masks seething rage, go back home type anger sub try upvote themselves.

Taiwan part China, currently occupied ROC government considered part China 99% world's governments. ROC always enemy PRC, know, civil war claiming rightful rulers China? 15 countries recognize ROC government actual ruling government China list *not* filled countries significant global power.

Imagine, will, Confederacy occupied Hawaii claimed rightful government United States actively tried pursue overthrowing United States Government. would US react? would country react? Likely defensive offensive posturing medium long term plans reunification. 


 China done help global south last 10 years west done 300 years. fact China helped numerous African countries build infrastructure, US STILL insisted regime change, militancy corporate imperialism Continent. Xi fact accountable Chinese people Congress, would removed power tried become tyrannical. final statement completely fallacious absolutely evidence support claim. What? doesn’t matter test country, far cases. It’s still absolutely case don’t diagnose vast majority covid infections. That’s blame anyone, it’s fact level community spread US. true time throughout pandemic, especially April May like mistakenly reference. sub feels like damn yo-yo. ""It's still over, even vaccine!"" articles ""This gamechanger!"" articles. kind annoying, tbh. Yeah people striving see optimisim none. Israel lockdown vaccinated people per capita get cases ever, pessimistic news rest world. number add up, covid beats vaccination rate even vaccination rate high. math. models Israel going see 7,000 8,000 infections per day MARCH.

I saying vaccinations effective, it'll take long deadly months serious effect. Mmm ones dying offsprings ones survived war.  Instead hoping bad things happen me, provide evidence? I'm wide open it, seen any. Danish study showed masks significant impact spread covid. another study showing something else? Unbelievable. Definitely validates worry mental state healthcare workers. We’re living pretty shitty chapter future history books.  doesn't. I'm saying maybe great president due covid future. They're stealing supermarkets! Oh covid sick leave. talking sick leave part PTO (vacation) case worked Wal-Mart, decision eating going work sick. 

But itll nice people able take care families get time so. America, you’re guaranteed time laws protecting labor (enforced, anyway.) 


One year worked every single holiday. finished college. best job ever had. Seriously. Whatever say. change fact wrong. people getting infected doses? vaccine taken full effect? surprise? Wasn’t like 52% effective first dose take week begin giving immunity? Phase 1 2 check safety. Phase 3 checks efficacy. Based results phase 1 2, interm report phase 3, historical data attenuated virus vaccines, Covaxin determined approved emergency use. Okay, didn’t approve untested vaccine approve one side-effects beyond usual found EVERY vaccine (injection site rash, allergic reaction ingredients vaccine, soreness). stop parading anti-vaxx propaganda don’t know crap you’re talking. It’s easy firing people won’t vaccinated. LPNs CNAs nursing homes physically emotionally difficult jobs pay little. fire 37% decline vaccines, find people replace them, make sense, people agree vaccinated.

For now, we’re better focusing education incentives firing people. Hopefully people’s first-hand experiences people vaccinated reduce skepticism. maybe Emergency Use Authorizations replaced full FDA approval make difference. Young people dying ending

Yeah quite rare cases young people die flu really concern anyone pre-Covid. 

BAsically vaccine widespread enough Covid less deadly flu, prevalence similar flu, basically fully opened normal. little reason continue lockdown stage eyes. They're dropping stupid SJW nonsense, work. thought estimates put 1:2 1:4 days. 1:10 true, states like AL pretty close herd immunity. Good you, it’s outdated. Time get rid like colleges Actually strong evidence FDR may actually Autoimmune disease called Guilliane-Barre syndrome, symptoms fall line with. It’s good news it’s UK. Never see kinds articles US. Gonna honest ya, Chief. get weeks pass 2nd dose, masks tossed garbage. dumb even waste time on. Reinfection ADE concern 650k deaths (for sake argument) 0.7% case fatality rate, would imply 98.9 million Americans contracted coronavirus. Assuming 11 million vaccinated least partially now, Biden hits 100m doses 100 days pledge, 4K deaths per day hold bit would US hitting 650k deaths 3/23. point 48.5m Americans received 2 doses vaccine, per Biden plan. 

I think we’re gonna blow past 650k. Assuming herd immunity 70 percent country, we’re pace (coincidentally) achieve herd immunity 4th July. vaccination death totals obviously won’t hold 6.5 months, number deaths current rates would 1.064 million 94m vaccinated.

I haven’t time add seasonal decline death rate decay due vaccination equation, it’s safe say 650k deaths going low number. Another spike seems inevitable then, judging people's reaction here. UK longer EU rules regime completion transition. extremely simple brain dead leavers forever play dumb ever understand it. disagreeing you. Apologies gave impression, even neutralizing antibodies, specially severe disease, something seems happening can't imagine many general population going same.

[The numbers there, willing willing take now. 22% take others do.

18% still saying no. drop 20% December.

78% population vaccinated great number. gotten point allow slow simmer continued cases, nothing extent what's going unlikely even level saw back summer 2020. that's rather minimal interventions (for instance, continued large scale testing precautions regarding symptoms masks retail outlets, little else) Genuine question: 14 here. adults get shots, what’s risk catching this? really don’t want wait another year shot help it.

Sorry turning life mere existence acceptable. interesting given saying first dose effective Pfizer (if true I'm sceptical) throws strategies like UK bad light. added injection-site reactions (those onset day 8) noted 244 participants (0.8%) first dose 68 participants (0.2%) second dose. Africas low numbers also result simply able accurately get numbers low access test kits, inability perform autopsies everyone dies? Journalists continue abuse words like “could” “may” “might.”

It’s fearmongering clicks.

When scientist says “this might happen,” don’t mean “eh, it’s 50/50, either equally likely.” could mean anything “this almost certainly happen haven’t specifically designed study eliminate possibility” “there’s every reason believe happen maybe meteor hits earth tomorrow chance.”

You could write following headlines would technically true give people different takeaways:

“New variant may make vaccines less effective”

“No evidence new variant covered vaccines”

“No evidence new variant evades vaccines”

“New variant unlikely make vaccines less effective”

“Vaccines expected show efficacy new variant”

“Scientists monitoring new variant could make vaccines moot”


All headlines literally true time everyone else present, apparently. cases dropping since December.

It makes think enter March vaccines still taking time, numbers fall, I'm going think virus seasonal. Really good news around PA, today saw 5300 cases covid, last Tuesday saw 7200 cases covid, weekly average dropping like crazy.

Also today start vaccinating everyone 65+, 16-64 serious medical condition. may saved lives showing it! 

The technology really cool potentially massive game changer. take DNA virus put process called Translation. takes double helix DNA RNA single helix structure. put RNA another process called Transcription, makes mRNA, messenger RNA live outside nucleus lives cytoplasm cell starts create proteins mRNA.

This process potentiality used cancer well. Hell, hard describe vast amount work done this, you... YES YOU... laid immune system line prove it. Puff chest know term ""hero"" laid you, today tomorrow. [You first use mRNA vaccine. test subject may create future without cancer many diseases. really selling vaccine there.

Every shot goes bad defeat. meteorite may graze right hand. think slow vaccinations slow data reporting weekend. know vaccinations would slow weekends holidays areas. I'd reserve judgment today's numbers come in. Yet homegrown morons city still claim “fake news” “the flu different”  I’m extrapolating vaccination rate first month rollout, imo one be. first stages always going hardest—working kinks distribution storage, needing vaccinate many disparate sites (nursing homes hospitals) instead centralized mass vaccination sites, dealing current administration’s failures, etc. Much like tests super hard come back April easy get states, I’m expecting vaccination rates skyrocket coming weeks months. May June may optimistic, I’d honestly surprised every adult US wants one isn’t vaccinated end summer/start fall. think it, think social distancing like artificial (and temporary) herd immunity. 

Did figure herd immunity function social interaction? OMG know whether laugh cry fuck? Free Statistically, lie. want obsess rare, absolute worst case scenarios, enjoy. state let vaxx next week, answer someone who's vaxxed handle future exposure/quarantine requests, particularly employers? Seriously going take happy rollout? We’ve two vaccines approved within past month, happened biggest holiday season year. expect us get 330 million us done within week?

Have things perfect? No. things continue ramp go? course will. 

To hear tell it, US government sitting 609 million doses rotting away it’s simply case. question: vaccine ever stopped transmission virus (for people mount immune response)?

A lot actually. Someone already mentioned polio, there’s also hepatitis B, rotavirus, pertussis flu. 

The reason intramuscular injection doesn’t good job creating local mucosal immune response likely need most. doctor but, antibodies produced immune system blood stream. virus gets blood stream one way another attacked antibodies white blood cells.

The virus get blood stream inhaling also eyes, nose mouth, like touch surface touch eyes. respiratory illness mean way gets body lungs. symptoms typically show up.

The virus multiply lot order make sick. immune multiplies body fights become sick. immune killed chance multiply get sick. Useless  go again, doom gloom week, consensus might beyond vaccine capabilities don’t vaccinate quickly enough. Next week: don’t worry vaccines cover mutations thus far Yep. That's getting said ""some pockets society"". good distancing, mask wearing, etc. going see things improve whole heck lot faster don't. Yes, would fine Sun primary source? selfish. put restrictions every disease that's third world country, would never leave homes.

COVID different. vaccine available anyone wants it, masks social distancing going away. not, point this?

The goalposts moved halfway moon. Mass vaccinations need line sand, never going end. article written Africa somehow ploy help Democrats? I’m really curious, people dumb you, ever think stuff posting it? experimental COVID-19 vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson produced protective antibodies novel coronavirus 90% 805 volunteers 29 days, **that increased 100%** day 57, according data ongoing mid-stage study. Fascinating, I'd never heard before. Going go find sources take board (for reasons days) that's really neat know. Surely. I'd also point I'm possible vector children hospitals LTC facilities, I'm sure actually care. already vaccine guilt, worry. Anybody deliberately spreading virus others may get killed severely punished. Serious question: vaccine ever stopped transmission virus (for people mount immune response)?

Rabies. OK, completely besides point, technically true. Rabies vaccine good save lives bitten since human human transmission extremely rare... Rabies vaccine also relatively high percentage people dead it, since usually given (or mostly given) somebody bitten suspected animal might late anyway.

Cali knows smoke Florida even Sun. Thank providing top source! /s People given vaccine, nobody died day... 100% effective. honestly reading sources vaccines 2020. damn well know vaccine prevents transmission literally every case. polio one every one we’ve ever made. Hell I’m willing bet getting Covid probably keeps protected longer 90 days people MERs whole back ago still form immunity years later. 

BUT understand caution. can’t tell people there’s 

1. don’t know true extent 
2. May case everyone 
3. even 1% don’t follow rules you’ll Fox News talking stuff ruining case vaccines undermining research. 

So doctors overly cautious say. 

But mods wants make slight prediction history sake public statement. engineer doctor don’t take run it. Covid like MERs you’re gonna immunity you’re lucky part certain percentage (MERs 86%). vaccine however you’re jumping immunity (which means lack spread) like 99%. Toss portion population get asymptotic (and they’ll probably side immunity right after). 

Basically we’re downhill virus couple points true. world gonna fine. wear masks get vaccine comes summer good fall. Sometimes think positivity needed doom gloom. 


MERs source: would hope so. I’m nursing home want palliative care morphine drip shit fine, admit it. 

It’s funny reading thread now, remembering apoplectic sub got early December *speculation* rich Americans “would definitely” jump vaccine line. People going nuts, don’t give fuck.

How antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 reach virus common infection sites?

As respiratory virus, enter body airways reach interior throat lungs.

Although parts body “inside” us, understanding act like exterior parts body. example there’s fluid filling airways lungs. least, don’t believe is.

The virus seems hit “external facing cells” droplets entering airways, outside cells cavity filled air... correct assessment?

So antibodies reach neutralize virus “outside infection?” lung cells saturate antibodies you’re breathing lungs coating interior lungs them? blood delivering near outer surface tissue neutralizes virus it’s able “dig little” interior layer cells?

Every ELI5 explanation antibodies I’ve ever seen says virus antibodies floating around fluid like either blood something else. case virus sort “outside” body work case?

I've never understood alternative was. nursing homes homes. read today apparently flu transmitted vaccinated people.

Of course cannot. prevalent flu one actually vaccinated against. flue vaccine 50% efficacy bad, half time virus season one vaccinated against. I’m expert last time checked, airways share portion digestive system. (Correct I’m wrong.) freaking tired goal posts moving, variant headlines, vaccine shortages, appointments canceled NY. I'm 24, turning 25 end March. I've lost lot year. career stopped dead tracks. I've stopped seeing friends, I've seen dad year, wear masks, distance. got vaccinated Friday get next dose next month. see light still. Everything botched I'm beginning feel like giving life never worth it. must better way. one judging everyone much seeing friends masked summer, eating indoors...so much judgement. I'm wondering: ways could happened? could get better? Yeah question feds stayed completely actual vaccine administration. federal resources, national guard, military, logistics, funding could helped. basically dumped vaccine state governor laps deal it. Well looks obvious time NYC first area hit US tough call. idea shutting streets NYC pretty radical. disagree would better move time first crisis easy. 100% people get vaccine die point. 😉 think real reason impossible know already vaccinated wasn't. people want vaccinated also ones first wear masks.

It's obvious everyone keep wearing masks reach daily new infection rate 1. sure Uighurs would agree you. needs human rights anyways, right? vitamine much better risk! live norway last weeks deaths vaccination covid. 

Source:  believe read far vaccine goes, relevant. sure witchcraft allows that, eh...Science. Ok, experts think do? 

How effect mortality?

I'm going year all, like people, following guidelines beyond. got vaccinated first dose last week. 

I'm indefinitely worrying. anxiety kill me. *I* kill me. 

No, flu. flu kill elderly like virus, mutate new vaccines needed. 

I'm sick all. Either going stop constant doom define end going lose generation mental illness. lockdowns working great apparently. Even so, case doesnt equate hospitalization. small percentage people infected require hospitalization, even smaller percentage require ICU care.

Only 3 states 90 percent capacity ICU beds.

Oh thank god there's least one sane person reddit. Like can't stand anymore. People think who're vaccinated measles still infect others?

Like literally everyone walking around spreading measles daily basis? everyone vaccinated get measles second leave home? ludicrous. no! it? Younger people life ahead them. Older people don't. know need put much attention much older people who'll pass away minute without covid.  read that? know that. 

People expecting spike due perceived correlation temperature cases elsewhere. Lol worry making new vaccines. worry make distribute new vaccine would take year especially two dose method Maskless bishops took photo together time ago Poland, close peak cases: - think dead. smaller cities, Texas standards. assume Walmarts areas would mix people wearing masks people wearing masks. bet, I'd say Abilene would people wearing masks.

I'm Houston even Walmart since March. places go groceries, medicine, go food, everyone I've seen wearing masks. course tend go early, close opening time, places busy. there's also 31 states worse could well get more.

But policy ever go affect Trump. OWS said age speed related adjustments would implemented 2 weeks, Biden actually follow not. Bullshit! G20 initiative, EU. EU even biggest donor, they're bottom list. funded UK ($706M), Canada ($246M), Bill &amp; Melinda Gates ($156M), Saudi Arabia ($153M), Norway ($134M), Japan ($130M), EU ($117), France ($117M), Germany ($117M). Yes, communist system, governors supposed look good paper.

The shit Soviet Union, shit Poland communist rule. There's herd immunity there's sterilizing immunization. Big difference. Herd immunity everyone ability fight virus get severely sick, bring infection level low enough less threat. Sterilizing immunity body kills completely spread all. believe case vaccines, least evidence would be. mean know better them. feel like need it, take it. heard important take get vaccine. fine take afterwards. moderna (small data) mobile, basically summarize Moderna Israel preliminary data showing reduction transmission 68% lie? Thought that? got clarification NM. Nearly 50% doses feds allocated us yet shipped, trackers everywhere showing huge unused stockpiles...but state them.

Trackers feds showed 200k, received hand 140k, given like 110k run rate 10k day, close running out. imagine NY seeing similar problems. probably similar Danish mink variant since H69/V70 deletion. apologize complete lack evidence-based answer partner got 2nd vaccine told taking something like Tylenol/Advil fine treating fever, frowned upon preemptively trying treat symptoms (aka shot anything happened).

Again though told person gave vaccine. don’t think it’s drastic according scientists. even said modify vaccine account change month so. issue re-distributing vaccine everyone US, without due process. ""Breaking rules"" license forcibly remove people homes. Florida basically better staying open. That's bad Cuomo failed. worst state nothing. It’s impression, it’s also people ready go back normal. Like transmission yes even level deaths going acceptable soon. people vaccinated you’ll start seeing concerts large sports events, bars nightclubs packed, etc. bet states hold longer eventually cave well due economic/voter pressure. problem store managers way physically remove violaters. call police remove person private property, usually gone then. Sure police follow warning / ticket store ban, cycle starts new idiots. I'm sick dealing this.

Nowhere really reporting ""received"" though. state (NM) reported like 238k received 101k given, federal tracker showed 200k distributed NM, one two days away running supply.

But feds done print shipping label, many even shipped yet, counted us as-if laying around. feds start showing tracking delivered states, they're planning thinking shipping soon. numbers would show lot states running 90+% supply. difference assuming one thing without proper evidence end wrong significant. guessing whether SPF-30 enough prevent getting sunburn beach today. whether still contagious cause additional severe illness death. suspect anything different considering half USA still goes lives like thing even exist first place. Welcome US politics rules made points matter! 2% got Vitamin C?

Religion culture faith; science culture doubt. - Feynman

It's honestly scary what's happening days. Expert scientists new priests, science new religion.

If look article published (you haven't) see base analisys ""projections"" cite different article, turn seem make projections based pretty much nothing all.

By way, ""projections"" predicting 150k deaths Sweden level measures applied. They're around 9k.

Trust, verify. I'm verifying. Data add up. ""projections"", ex-post data. Can't really fake make-pretend that.

You believe science almighty experts save us all. Good you. hope thread spark doubt mind someone reads it. Even one single individual worth it. Wait thought control there? would drastic change. think scientists said likely. get wrong. I'm blind appeal argument, particularly people take long view history countries much poorer West developing countries. fact matter aside price vaccines limited nature supply (there nonprofits NGOs could appeal money buy vaccines developing countries issue), there's bigger issue many developing countries simply cannot deliver kind vaccines currently approved, least outside major urban areas. need servicable roads distribution services handle getting vaccines need go hospitals equipment store vaccine doses, mention electrical grid reliably run refrigeration equipment enough doctors nurses get doses patients. Good luck place like Haiti.

&amp;#x200B;

In meantime, elderly need vaccine. need vaccinate clinical doctors nurses, United States probably Europe, people elderly typically getting vaccine doctors nurses. side note, we’ve trying vapotherm 100% nonrebreather lately. meant? seems buy time, short Bipaps. misread? add this, already found data stating ditch masks vaccination already CDC's excess death (number deaths expected average) page shows 470,000 dead since Feb 1, 2020. week ago. seem update week.  use dead guys reddit thread start shit. see disgusting is? really herd immunity herd. said, artificial (and temporary). Herd immunity discussed is, seemingly, always assumption life back normal.

There way doctor would attribute downturn cases possible herd immunity, even combination vaccinated + infected + distance reducing spread dramatically LIKE would happen real herd immunity. fuck California doing? According Bloomberg, six states lower percentage shots used. That's basic virus knowledge. mutations random effect negative. species dies out. Beneficial mutations conquers world first time I’m hearing antibodies vaccine way different antibodies natural body immune system response virus. whole point vaccine simulate virus let immune system recognize develop corresponding antibodies. poor guy dying, 99% sure genetic testing initial ‘subsequent’ infection performed identify strain. Except Trump racist xenophobe ""banned"" travel China.

Look much slower ""ban"" travel Europe things got bad there. Look much travel ""ban"" actually stop. US Citizen? Come right in, 14 day quarantine, test, nothing. 

So, yes, travel restriction prevents foreigners entering country providing absolutely protection Americans returning abroad carrying virus something called racist xenophobe for.

I'd also like note party line explicitly calling Trump racist xenophobe China ban. call racist xenophobe general avoiding explicit criticism China travel restrictions. Thanks reply..wow reply! think need read finished work. Thank explanation, plenty people Reddit would rather abuse take time reply detail. given home work Nocebo..I never heard look forward investigating thanks flu vaccine essentially protecting educated guess strain going circulating come flu season. influenza virus markedly different coronavirus mutates rapidly, much vaccine needs re-tooled every year. leads fluctuating efficacy rates, outright stop transmissions. really works correct strains chosen tailor vaccine for, otherwise much. comparing COVID vaccine flu vaccine pretty useless analog. know, Im sure. sick tired well. Barely house since march.

Hopefully current vaccines give protection e484 mutation variants, severity mortality reduced.  see tighter restrictions going away quickly (but let’s honest, people refuse wear mask second get vaccine ones following restrictions anyway) public social distancing masks certain indoor/crowded spaces lingering still. 

I’m happy continue simple measures public see numbers cases deaths drop manageable level stay (it’s hard say amount death “manageable”, I’m sure else say it) experts say don’t need anymore, know many won’t. coded 43 year old yesterday. huge guy 45 mins CPR. Everybody walking room either tears 1000 yard stare. One nurses stayed night shift help 11, even though working night. walked crying hard wasn’t safe.

I'm you. everyone reasonable chance get vaccinated social circle vaccinated, done restrictions. problem hosting indoor events, going maskless public, traveling, going movies etc.  Thank (embarrassed blush) Reinfection rare. “reinfected” within week two? 

Highly unlikely. 

There’s proof reinfection here, honestly, facts sort disprove reinfection case. 

So, like cases virus subreddit, “stupid friend Facebook” likely much closer accurate “the silly poster Reddit” making fun them.  Mr. Trump made sure make difficult! Michigan factory Toronto it’s 5 hour drive believe, yet doses come across ocean risk Trump prevent export like 3M N95s. can't wait start deleting comments criticizing China mods bed them. Covax initiated funded rich countries EU. 

Russia, US China participate international vaccine cooperation want expand hegemony means vaccine policies. Nobody saying otherwise. 

Right less 5% population vaccinated, thus still risk. We'll need keep precautions like mask wearing place much larger number vaccinated, determined level vaccine reduces asymptomatic spread. quote ""It's like need wear mask rest life,"" says. ""You need wear mask data, we're trying get answers fast can."" ??? Yh every factor different Ehh I'd take restrictions half assed restrictions indefinitely. significant amount population care self isolating finding venues socialize. also enforcement rules people, businesses failing ""lockdowns"". God plan...until ones suffering. Population density extremely high urban East Asia. quite easy small cluster infections spread like wildfire (cough Tokyo cough). personally think see literally day now. first shot vaccine reportedly 50% effective 10-12 days. hospitalizations fatalities generally 12-15% population. point probably almost everyone at-risk population Israel least one shot. weeks that, illnesses group fall 90%+ 80-90% overall illnesses.  vaccine 100% effective? what's called, Windowfreefallvax ?  exact proportional basis, it’s 158K US. Poorer countries generally worse hygiene education still done better real terms country spends $700 billion war alone.

They ""done better"". fewer reported deaths younger population many people die without Covid tests. know deaths linked, media want cover it. Plenty states allowing 20-40 year olds current pool. 

In extreme NJ allowing anyone claims smoker, even 21 barely smoked. 

Many states also allow people health conditions even health conditions moderately increase risk. Age far biggest predictor, yes may 20-50 year olds particular conditions make truly high risk risk average 64 year old 20-25 times 20-30 year old. mild increase 20-30 year olds risk due condition almost never increasing risk 25 times.

These young people better dealing cumbersome scheduling websites extent crowding 70-90 year olds less able check site 5 times day.   second vaccine, EpiVacCorona, peptide vaccine (contains parts coronavirus proteins).

Sputnik V adenovirus vector vaccine, similar Astra Zeneca J&amp;J vaccines.

Interesting results, reporting accurate. peptide vaccines less effective mRNA adenovirus vector ones. GSK/Sanofi apparently restarted clinical trials peptide vaccine, testing different formulations, initial trials show good efficacy. average age across entire African continent barely adult.

They're going low rate matter what. Smart Investment  don’t Oh, see mean now. talking Wage subsidy close contact, right?

Under current law, still entitled pay government either directly employer.

They might change studies show vaccines stop reduce transmission, probably months away, considering debating whether even allow vaccinated people freedoms.  sent us home work “two weeks” back March thought bright. “Two weeks?” said. “More like two months!”

Obviously things little worse anticipated. ""Skeptics"", Deniers Worldometers.info us past 400k days ago. checkout comments post something good done government. literally find excuses hate government even that. Go self-hate circle-jerk somewhere else. one iota good. wanted read paywall. actually true? get it, get mild symptoms? passed 400.000 days ago. around 409.000 moment. Yes, technically they're heavy lifting. people know Pfizer vaccine, that's easiest way refer without confusion. Cool

Let's revisit convincing people 120 million gotten vaccine trying say? man picture modi supporter hate that. would delete post? Well end case would people going back normal lives even vaccines effective - Americans already doing.

Do people sub seriously expect people live like forever? fire nurses declined, problem solved. 1 10 say pandemic controlled? owe anyone anything 

The west owes Congo 15 million lives including billions made exporting rubber 1885 1908. much lives worth you? west totally owes Africa lot, let's act like giving million every year cleans blood-stained hands. say mink variant, said probably similar mink version.

We'll know certain result sequencing made public.  benefits farrrrrrrrr weighed cost. Even completely ignored health benefits economic benefits returned economic activity would say use whatever vaccine now. Pfizer changed tune recently. NY governor also said accept Trump vaccine delayed rollout could review are. priority, payment. companies programs giving employees extra hours and/or cash incentive. jabs cost anything. TJs employee - correct customers time this. owned different Aldi, one runs Aldi stores U.S. already unblinded Chattanooga site. think unblinded earlier. day 8 Novavax. First 7 days mild reactions, I'm immune compromised.  Here's lovely Western ideology work.

We care people world inconveniences us. ones matter. goodwill self-gratifying bullshit. feel better exploited rest world. tell we're good guys.

It's selfishness disgusts me. hypocrisy. people still delude whatever bullshit justifications think of. never admit important thing lives freedom, justice, equality, comfort. over, look rest world can't afford even fraction comforts liberties say ""how could value freedom/justice/equality little"", still believing champion good. I? Israel proved Pfizer recipients cannot spread virus.  us still time even spread Italy, still going ""oh terrible poor souls countries, problem though"". based logic mom eating inside forever.

have fun! Six San Diego health care workers allergic reactions vaccines received mass vaccination center Jan. 14. site temporarily closed using vaccines UK advised that?? told offer limited protection distancing far important measure. 

And I, like many think children (or students age) sit wearing mask lessons limited benefit. 

Not risk eliminated sometimes pros outweigh cons. counting collateral deaths suicides overdoses went I’m pandemic covid? needs snappy expression describe nose waggers - common occurrence.

something witty - anyone anything? strongly urge Biden reconsider. least open essential businesses relationships (e.g. \#loveisnottourism).

I say someone diligent wearing masks even answer door, leaving house every weeks supplies, etc.

CDC recommended testing travel bans. promotes testing (more data better), proven bans help much first place.

Believe not, us travel leisure. important listen scientists choose logic politics.

In opinion Trump trolling Biden he's taking bait. 

But, going lock everything absolute essentials weeks get with. Breaking news: Old people sometimes die. things help them, wear mask, don’t go often, educate others instead spreading ignorance western country free cost matter. 

It's still good think public spending. ""Our polonium tea vaccine 100% success rate catching Covid-19."" Even though prevents disease reduces severity get sick?That’s zero benefit? Well I’m honest, mostly could gave confidence slightly vaccine-skeptic mom friends lot questions. better way know actually part it?

From understand, mRNA vaccines Pfizer Moderna produced built potentially game-changing technology might able quickly make vaccines pandemic epidemic future. Yeah, whenever anybody Reddit (or anywhere) absolutely obnoxiously sure something, sure know jack, possess unbearable compulsion shut information align worldview. And/or dominate, however can. 

They can't separate thoughts emotions miss learning moment.  others feel way egg on.   

I take learning moment, people.....lol  Yeah, think every local community leader make big presentation getting available. biggest problem needs distanced, without food, probably ""the TV"". guess, still good see desired results replicated public administration vaccine rather controlled trial. help strengthen public confidence vaccine, also reducing likelihood anything design trials selection participants accounted results rather strength vaccine itself. That's decision infamous cake case about. Supreme Court issue opinion whatsoever whether business could deny servies people grounds religious beliefs. people say baker ""won"" case, Court agreeing Colorado Civil Rights Commission neutral pursuit baker, baker could refuse make cake. Imagine many early we’re never tested. Grandma's grandpa's what? rollout slow already. would slow more. Plus eventually want everyone get could cause confusion.  vague estimates CDC (which constantly failed literally anything whole pandemic beyond useless, trust word anymore),

This much bigger, far untold story come pandemic. public's trust government overall, public health orders completely eroded due massive amounts misinformation peddled Trump administration. Thinking competent administration quickly rebuild trust would misguided.

Honestly, political end administration upon us can't believe quickly incompetence mixed dose malice destroy institutions keeping country afloat. yes, I'm US we've watched happen throughout world whole lives never here. yes, I'm definitely little naïve whole topic. hardwired, I’m pretty sure moving would violation lease agreement possibly insurance Quit BS. Nothing quote says spread get sick outside 5.9% US Government offered $50 people get vaccinated, would probably save paying far stimulus packages. mean he's kinda right. Wyoming Kansas whatever can't get vaccines distributed would silly prevent states taking doses could get Americans vaccinated.

I know there's evidence situation actually occuring though. We’re definitely living history here. vaccines best achievement we’ve decades. antibody test see needs vaccine? Surely good percentage need it.. - cheaper give vaccine even need it? “There’s going lot intense demand even younger cohorts, think get 100 million, maybe 120 million vaccines, demand going get soft,” Gottlieb said, basing forecast number U.S. **adults received flu shot** past year. 

I think assumption valid. flu stop millions people seeing loved ones travelling world. Also flu vaccine(s) close efficacy mRNA vaccines COVID people keen a) protect b) get back normal life.

For cautious getting COVID vaccine (rather completely antivaxx), reassured family, friends, neighbours, co-workers, etc. get shots. Even antivaxxers come around embrace self-preservation aspect. Utah. people self-involved, self-important, religious-fanatical, science-rejecting twits understand mask designed hang around CHIN (seriously) needs cover minimum mouth bonus nose. 

HATE here.

Curious live?  antibodies produced B cells severe cases neutralizing, though. virus may infect macrophages directly there's evidence express ACE2. ADE side things, may happening antibodies directed ACE2 itself, basically caught complex S1.

There autoantibodies generated severe COVID-19 due hyperinflammation, though. So, may seeing ADE, rather autoimmunity. instance, autoantibodies phospholipid associated proteins leading antiphospholipid syndrome results clots. valid points, still doesn’t give right dick. Damn, reading makes feel like caught Covid couple weeks ago issue vaccinations slow since people get reinfected. also means mist vaccinates already despite great immunity normal strains - shame, since vaccinating right away would save vaccines. Go job-shadow coroner report back. Yeah, I'll keep skepticism high one. praised first one too, Putin refused take shot, came restrictions regarding age, etc. There's nothing magical crossing international border vs non-international border makes virus spread more. proposing would Europe wide shelter place order experts, including WHO, saying needed beginning. Smart move. Israel would probably use poison. right point all,  really blows mind. We've home since March last year. kinds still school remotely. I'd almost kill vaccine, expect get least another month two... half country might bother getting it?  know died out. Overall hospitalizations peaked last week ICU admissions highly correlated those. truly ""hump"" - least sense absolute peak. We're still shockingly elevated levels hospitalizations cases overall trajectory pretty clear here. least nation-wide basis we've gotten worst (with asterisk individual states may still worst come). 

Even deaths started turn corner, although they'll last show sustained decline given lag cases hospitalizations. agree... lot chatter among medical &amp; scientific community past infection may provide immunity new variants, yet folks thread assuming herd immunity... strongly condemn everyone went strong consensus experts.

Cuomo crowd idiots excuse decisions. London's lockdown idea what's parked near downing street. Besides shellfish exported. Either way going chance eat it.

Okay, let's open everything March 1st. knows things look like, we'll use deadline. happens things worst terms # cases, even X amount people vaccinated? Fuck it, stick plan?

The choice lockdowns forever vs 5% increase mortality. lockdowns months vs increase mortality + increase # cases thus leading overwhelmed hospitals. fallout much greater 400,000 people dead COVID.

Edit: Realistically, March last year locked set deadline would 6 months away. Check back September #'s would sucked. suppose could argue set hard deadline lockdown people may actually tried harder, would enforced much more...but doubt it.

Also, want return normal much anyone else, I'm frontline worker. I'm doctor nurse. overwhelmed work, crying people dying shift. like USA U.K.  Humanity developed vaccine record-smashing time using relatively new technology got efficacy vaccines decades development ever see. 

This news breh. Lol Arizona getting expensive don’t know you’re real estate prices aren’t cheap anymore get expensive. 

You though, it’s life. need take strangers comment seriously get butthurt. think : somewhere history, enough people thrown windows create word it. believe average time positive test death 16 days?

So even people re-isolated starting Jan 2, lot deaths early Feb already baked in.

Sure pulled severe Lockdown starting yesterday deaths might start fall mid February. Gains vaccine returning non holiday activities small slow growing. likely 500,000 deaths Feb according incoming CDC head Dr. Rochelle Walensky. Hey that’s awesome! strong suspicion received placebo, we’ll see happens!

It feels bit weird us “jumping line”, That’s way saying “thank you” suppose. addition giving people study, since told would start whole phase 3 process placebo originally choose vaccinated. also good PR, i'd rather go store encourages workers get vaccinated one doesn't. Haha linked someone discussion thread It’s optional section think understand argument made think recommendation eat healthy, make meals eat much fresh produce possible universal advice regardless ongoing pandemic - like active lifestyle limiting harmful substances much possible. 
 
And since direct evidence yet foodborne transmission urgent issue (unlike airborne fomite/surface transmission), might overkill make big fuss specifically this. mean, we're already constantly bombarded, almost point oversaturation, health safety information is, piling even top may actually counter-productive. I'd say case ""pick battles"" public health point view, focus issues information urgent make biggest difference.   they’re concerned safety vaccine? think it’s pretty reasonable concerned potential side effects vaccine developed year..

There's vaccine well-reviewed data suitable much developing world. Maintaining chain refrigeration Pfizer vaccine would impossible Moderna vaccine would also extremely difficult impossible.

The Sinovac vaccine (the Chinese government backed vaccine) disappointing data 50% efficacy ongoing large trials. Certainly better nothing, still good Pfizer Moderna vaccines.

Russia claims sputnik 5 vaccine 91% effective, I'm skeptical they've given 1.5M doses despite first vaccine start administered worldwide. Either massive manufacturing issues lack efficacy means want massive vaccination campaign.

The Oxford/Astrazeneca's vaccine probably first available poorer countries. J&amp;Js vaccine high efficacy young middle aged adults, glaringly released data 65 population yet. One became one best Presidents (FDR). Displaying ignorance: hit got TDR department TX government. I’m pretty sure that’s meant. What, pray tell, TDR?

Mask wearing isn’t “stringent” Ghana/Togo early October that’s false romanticised notion. it? secret? announced he’s going try buy directly Pfizer instead federal govt sent us 53k entire week. That’s even 2 days worth. Get facts straight.  Another deliberate mongering title 70% population still spread virus quickly. lady group 100% trying start shit, fuck I'm glad TJ let fools in.  BeTtEr sAfE It’s scary people don’t realize this. hear Florida open they’re fucked, meanwhile they’re okay compared places like NYC locked well. feel sorry family guy thinks wearing masks indoors public place isn’t essential. I'm even discussing long bureaucratic procedures, none us knows what's period time required testing would need.

These vaccines body produce new proteins, proven safe spike protein. doubt would wing new type protein without testing.

Even needs 3 months, long time.

My point is: countries rely vaccines, stall much possible virus spread reduce chance mutations. Hi! I'm trying reply questions individually, broken up. wrong media outlets can, theory, publish whatever want. clinical trial data gets published and, cases much publicity vaccine, \*combed\* scientists. errors identified, erratum process official corrections.

Typically, worth, remotely reputable media outlet knows numbers either already available become imminently available there's much point fabricating them. Media outlets also really stand benefit lying figures, there's nothing them.  Moderna 18, Pfizer 16. literally replied comment talking obesity smoking deaths. topic hand.  Here’s look it- RNA vaccines way effective expected, variants would probably lower efficacy around level expected originally (low 70% range) Hard times So, fun fact: people **never get COVID**, even live households everyone *else* got COVID would never able avoid it.

There’s evidence suggests MMR vaccine, specifically titers Thank saving evidence money spend covid bailouts west could “cured” malaria TB child malnutrition infant mortality.

I’m really tired Olympic crap. athletes aren’t vaccinated long then, something went terribly wrong. Also, best athletes world.

But daily 8K-10K new cases located small amount cities government don’t try enforce, cities everyone mass events gatherings,

The big cities like TLV, Haifa, beer Sheva etc gets 5%-7% confirmed cases tests
While cities like Jerusalem Bnei brak get 20% (1 every 86 confirmed) 

Cities people go rules fine even first dose vaccine, cities without enforcement getting increased numbers new cases one tries anything that, “collective punishment” citizens without going enforce main source it, rate lockdown never end.

We could lockdown weeks government doesn’t care, don’t try enforce cities cases, everything like normal, vaccines won’t going help can’t even control contaminated cities, 

The link number cities % cases Yeah well, I'll need source - find strange cells produce new proteins goes without testing.

Uh, fear mongering.

So please share info require trials.

I already said would rather wait corona would nice evidence could done without much risk. expect thing though.  Yeah, like giving credence anti-maskers. people charge honest shit, they’d nothing go on.  Seems like good idea influential politicians sportsmen setting example communities. Agree. 

I think Fauci rest PC (and optimistic) aiming full re-opening herd immunity achieved something might happen year (or next one).

The reality groups people simply accept vaccinated delay herd immunity they're problem.  

IMO sensible time fully reopen vaccine available regardless herd immunity reached.

Thanks laysplaining science scientist though. senator state working improve paid sick leave? I've presented facts case lot, neither addressed. Quite amusing level projection said lot, lowest denom accusations always straight confessions. know, point don’t remember pre covid even felt like. don’t remember it’s like see friends, hobbies involving people, enter store without fear. 

At point doesn’t even matter anymore. current hell exists, least that’s feels like. dates feel equally like never study period May November 15 22 states. May U.S averaging ~20K cases per day, November risen ~150k cases per day. Obviously cases increase much per day, children also infected. Funnily enough, going 20K 150K cases per day increase 750%. study says: ""At beginning study, average cumulative hospitalization rate per 100 000 children 2.0, increasing 17.2 end study,"" 

Which 760% increase written table. Wow coincidence.

Yeah thing good aldi chicken tends little better bread good, go absolutely to. like getting brand everything. “Personally, I'm keeping mask around flu season. Everyone lives someone else should...”

Cool, you. Personally, I’ll going back pre-covid mask-free life. trying de-legitimize pandemic bc know affects everyone differently even Covid, worse 48ish hour bug get every year. I’ll continue trusting immune system gives reason stop. include trader joes? Pretty sure set vaccine sites rather give hospitals everybody go there. know thats happening now, wasnt start.

Colleges would good place. Make rural people drive rather send vaccine out, least start.

Then registration system start. Go online. Put info. Get places appropriate tier get notified go. Make honor system people put jobs/conditions subject big penalty lying.

Give employers specific industries way get people signed up.

I think supposed putting something week Cal, reason place ready go December.

Its logistics. Yeah first dose kept couple nights. Every time I'd roll onto I'd wake up. second dose much less arm pain. Well - didn’t merge pretty much since creators gone?

Not use title clickbait. spread potential misinformation. needs replicated go stating fact. 106,300 excess deaths country since mid-March.  Somewhere future: ""We reach herd immunity 2077""

Then 2077 comes, indeed reach herd immunity... world glitchy. can't think comparable situation tbh. I'm guessing places take two different routes:

1. give damn get vaccine not.
2.

Scroll replies see abundance people calling dumbass saying day 9 months covid restrictions got shitty economy. 400,000 deaths. proof sensationalism? Obviously reinfections. recent studies suggesting \~90 percent immunity natural infection. 10 percent lot people may susceptible, course people catching again. vaccines. thing, would widespread guy even need collect articles prove point. basically, think it, fact collect articles alone like ""LOOK HERE, SEE GUYS"", shows still relatively rare, point least. reminder salaried stop OT pay. That's shitty. already fairly big incentive. Avoiding costly law suits. Workplaces probably face lawsuits they’re requiring employees vaccinated (or Dr. note) vaccine readily available emergency authorization transitions normal FDA approval. 

The dems blocked Covid liability protection businesses GOP trying sneak weeks ago. Employees still sue employer isn’t providing safest workplace possible pandemic. It’s wild read lol Sad ask another country's leader, are... Jesus, remeber hearing '' *Hopefully* we'll see deaths coming soon '' like year ago. Cuomo DeBlasio hand waving numbers making adjustments make look better. That's basically what's going here. 

For example, strip LTCF doses, update doses received end week, surprised adjustments.

But even according NYC's data 400k unused doses, best day far 35k. I'm personally favor eradication reason mentioned -- unless literally everyone eradicates zero-covid policy may require permanently closed borders. 

But true countries keep virus successfully tame vaccination going think whether want avoid new mutations coming elsewhere. Hard know what's best. Hm well like customer cheap. germany use purchasing power heavily burden food manufacturing. influential pushing small farmers. routinly change ingredients without notice make cheaper produce mainting retail price. Like reduce basicilum content pesto, swap olive oil cheap plant oil increase sugar content.

Theyre evil, pretty much big groceries stores germany extent shady. also buy stuff every then. would never make cult ""loving Aldi"", despite marketing trying hard so. Trader Joe's existing American company Aldi Nord bought them. tested. forget count people know sick hid economic reasons  Or, hear out, could give vaccines millions risk people already bought waiting give healthiest group people country marketing ploy? matter?! Come back lost loved one gross negligence. people DIRECT contact vulnerable. 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities 12-15% population specifically aged 65+ pre-existing conditions. vaccinated, hospitalizations fatalities drop 80-90%. lot bang buck focus people first. Stick licking windows, like do. Like Israel, share human rights skeletons credit due vaccination front. No. average age Africa 19. Covid non factor. hard wear mask go shopping case? still hang people live normally time. wear mask go store. It’s really hard.  Yep also say ""thousands vaccine doses wasted"" ""0.01% distributed vaccine doses wasted"". statements equally true, first sounds bad, second sounds good. Tell Tedros, we’ll give vaccines figure virus came from. Good luck. It’s speculation dude. average age Africa like 19. 

Covid complete non factor compared malaria. vaccines tested properly determine people could spread virus even vaccinated. admire optimism point personally don’t see happening. ever interviewed hired anybody? desirable jobs. fire refusers they'll go deliver packages Amazon make pay rate. left staff shrinks 40-50% overnight. still data long immunity lasts for. like coronaviruses, sterilizing immunity last 3-6 months... think hospitalizations drop first, since at-risk population vaccinated. cases among young healthy illnesses among elderly. elderly vaccinated first think indicator drop first.  they're going lecture us ""moral failing"". Fucking idiot. saying strain comes that’s highly contagious completely bypassed V1? That’s possible according scientists said modify vaccine easily accommodate that. issue becomes getting everyone V2 considering slow V1 rollout is. would basically re-vaccinate everyone V2 starting square one Lol yep.

""The rest family recovered, though effects linger. daughter still can’t smell taste. wife gets tired easily lingering headaches.""

Oh, keep told virus really bad old people, survival rate metric matters. FEAR!!!! that, it’s completely reasonable expect someone vaccine clears virus faster someone without. 

Increased antibodies cell memory = faster response. didn’t, vaccines wouldn’t work. stands reason clear virus faster, since response faster.

If: clear virus faster *and* asymptomatic vaccinated person sheds virus rate (or slower) asymptomatic non-vaccinated person **then** person less contagious overall.

It’s simple line. Total infectiousness = avg infectiousness * Time.

I've biological fieldwork Madagascar years now. say absolutely correct, effective delivery outside major metro areas. infrastructure there. enough refrigerated trucks maintain temps etc. proper delivery rural areas. enough local clinics rural areas freezer capacity etc. roads good enough shape ensure delivery time. needed countries like less-temperature sensitive, one-shot vaccine. right ok Need see paper - replicated - would rather serious need new vaccine. Agreed. everyone actually opportunity vaccine, need slowly remove restrictions monitor.

But goalposts moved much all, anything due lack compliance anti-maskers enough restrictions, slow rollout vaccines. least vaccines *are* rolling out. long there's significant setbacks along way we'll likely see semblance normal summer.

Agree, disagree, doesn’t matter. perception. 
The fact we’ve never addressed concern directly much resistance. Anytime hear “when life normal” it’s nearly always coupled “but continued masking may necessary” 
Continued masking lot people basically means life knew going shredder people imposing dismissive it, sometimes downright giddy. 
We never tried dealing behavioral side it’s virus transmission time.  still don’t get know least 2 husband wives one got virus didn’t despite sleeping bed. virus bizarre seems pick people random lol making shit up. exactly.

First, we'd need see effective (or ineffective) vaccines new strains. Lockdowns might actually occur resistant cause health crisis equal current one.

If vaccines fight well enough sufficient death count warrant lockdowns, delayed all.

If chance extremely resistant, yeah, may see months trials try get another vaccine working. even lock varient, chances last one. virus suppressed vaccine reduced chance mutating.

So I'd take position everyone gets vaccinated prominent strains, ones going effective. most, social distancing mask wearing still warranted, lockdowns. said federal pharmacy program, partnered Walgreens CVS administer doses long-term care facilities, appears over-allocated based number individuals actually going take vaccine. noted somewhere 75% 85% nursing home residents opting take vaccine 33% employees opting receive it.  Sounds like never got invited party. =/ mean, I'd rather cold go anaphylactic shock. banned entering America March (Europeans) time, racism claim based 3 4 week period it’s shaky shitting dog Something feels slightly letting random people track individual vaccine deliveries can't quite put finger :)

Further, patients intentionally told would receive cancer cells researchers felt would unnecessarily frighten them. Researchers asserted good cause predict cancer cells going rejected.
In subsequent review proceedings conducted Board Regents State University New York, found study presented hospital’s research committee physicians responsible patients’ care consulted. researchers found guilty fraud, deceit, unprofessional conduct.

I'm saying reason wear masks want to. people treated like weirdos even adults pick anything looks ""different"". bet people whine politicized, morally opposed it. true. lot comments saying “nothing much changed quarantine” speaks volumes. diseases vaccinate mild COVID young healthy people. probably get hospitalized flu, sure hell take flu shot heck lot better getting actual flu.

Hopefully come soon :) Holy shit, maybe virus real /s  Considering violent riots United States past year past ten years, I'd say pretty accurate. entire country gotten cabin fever. younger people singlehandedly overwhelm healthcare system. 20% definitely false estimate literally means 1 every 5 non elderly people get coronavirus go hospital that’s objectively false (as in, I’m willing guess selective estimate worst-case scenario group young adults). case, 20% factors younger people at-risk factors vaccinated factored “at-risk groups”. Life needs resumes deaths gone that’s what’s happening. Idk. Maybe news J&amp;Js production problems, US even getting AZ till April already slow rollout. even know J&amp;J effective yet either Dunno America however UK salaried aldi hours back

So work extra 30 hours. owed 30 hours. Sadly need kind important information write article. conservative 3x amount. know 80% people asymptomatic - I’m pretty sure hiker much higher. I’m Texas it’s pretty insane here. wouldn’t know though. Same! miss faces see it’s already beginning. “Young adults live restrictions next 2-3 years old people poor countries get vaccinated” Interesting way walk back rules. Sorry, US. hang ups words do. like poke fun. Herd immunity stupid goal nearly impossible achieve.

Not less 70-85 percent population would willing take vaccine moment, 70-85 percent population even vaccine eligible (e.g., 16). 

""Herd immunity"" can't goal able normal a) literally possible tools available now, b) one even knows true herd immunity value even is. metric that's nebulous difficult accurately measure. know.

It may April/May easy get appointment though. Yes, set targets number deaths, number hospitalizations, number cases, number vaccinations want hit order reopen. specific targets really vague goals like “reduce spread”. specific goals/targets want hit? idea, least state, zero plan. sadly dont get point Full lockdown since last week lighter spring 2020.

It’s wild keep getting downvoted saying continue wearing mask, hope stay mandatory. also read that

Do reliable source spreading misinformation?  Trump said would go 15 cases 0. also said would less 50000 deaths less 100k would done great job. hospitals US

The Mayo Clinic included generalized phrase last time checked definitions words ""same people""? mean British, I've seen anyone say anything like that. mean, they'll happened previous pandemics: accept keep going stops. History shows norm living lot death; we've done past year that's unusual. 

I.e. economy schools staying open Spanish Flu killed millions (and probably mutated become deadly) normal deciding live death toll uncontrolled pandemic. think probably speaks well modern world decided that.

So pessimism country keep restrictions place semi-permanently trying control virus, work, we'll worst worlds.

There many different ways pessimist days. Bring quarter you. Trust Pfizer like Moderna first serve US market. Even GSK/Sanofi declared summer would first serve US market. Europe needs vaccine production. means Biontech, Janssen Curevac Moderna. sure ur downvoted, u said right mean, make norm, sure. everyone else? snowbirds 2nd home state, possibly pay taxes there, live part year.

It equivalant allowing state students college town access vaccines peers.

What think covid tourism. Keep living basement, troll. raised wolves? think intention negative, think there's lot merit understanding dollar amount potential recipients, versus something ambiguous. absolutely right countries funded, developed, distributing vaccines get priority access citizens. objectively one weirdest fucking comments / opinions I've ever seen Reddit.

Not magically. decrease gradual, drastic. Cope getting mad. isn’t fault. It’s government’s. lacking information! problem mainstream media publish real truth covid, medications vaccin problem. Yes! Fingers crossed. Really surprised lot people thread disagreeing saying don’t really care countries. sub pushing flatten curve, wearing masks year, two measures help protect people. 
For context, fully support older higher risk individuals poorer countries vaccinated myself. don’t need vaccine badly, I’m happy wait turn. indeed stepped game up. grew access both, Nord Süd Nord products used inferior generally speaking. Süd stores nicer too. never chose go Nord store pretty bummed moved go university.

But stuff become better since. hope right, agree may be! depends cases rise drop healthcare/older population vaccinated social distancing eliminated; right now, evidence around that, though sounds like UK may soon based statements. Think through. 50% people want get vaccine, means we're going dealing covid mutated versions years, could easily eradicate 2021. Either give (and everyone) incentive get vaccinated tax break, give companies incentive make sure employees vaccinated. Even though interpretation communism wrong point makes absolutely zero sense, cares optics public health stake? Tax incentives work get things done, whether like not. Uhh.. science data suggests vast, VAST majority people get either asymptomatic entirely, mild symptoms worst. Saying otherwise actually ignoring scientists sensationalizing.  EU ordered CureVac additional Biontech/Pfizer vaccines GSK/Sanofi AZ problems became clear. 

Initially EU relied AZ (400m), GSK/Sanofi (300m), Janssen (400m), Biontech/Pfizer (100m), Moderna (80m).

With hindsight easy say would better order Biontech Moderna less Sanofi AZ; however, small start-ups without track-record, everybody considered AZ frontrunner GSK/Sanofi big enough deliver driven national politics

Which try everything make safer. example, let young children drive, require car safety inspections, require seatbelts. 

Getting struck lightning significantly less likely (and happens far fewer people) dying car accident. 

So would say good idea (or reasonable cars technically kill people) climb tall tree really cared children's health, advocating close schools every winter flu.

I follow, since vaccine flu approved recommended children, makes full school closure unnecessary proper vaccinations recieved. 

I think reasonable person would advocate stronger enforcement flu vaccination children easier access flu vaccines students. However, *if vaccine hypothetically exist*, yes course would prefer school closure winter meant fewer children would suffer (and potentially die) flu. Firefighters get paid really really well california least. Go transparentcalifornia.com see need approve AstraZeneca I'm pretty torn this. Yes, would good way increase trust vaccine, especially among African Americans.

(sry, make fun strangely ambiguously worded headline) Nonsense, nobody knew responsible countries still ordered bulk. best case get working vaccine asap, worst case lose little money. Every week lockdown costs much vaccines everyone. mention cost lives lost. dont understand incentives. vaccine even available general public? kinda feels like PR stunt they're offering pay something employees can't even do. Also, trust British newspaper (even Guardian) claims “EU debacle”. Right now, *do* vaccine able inject (at least France, injected 30% available stocks...).

And think 2s alternative would been: 27 countries competing vaccines... mess. Two thirds isn’t enough herd immunity, it? think remember reading 70% needed that. Don’t draw conclusions get CDC data. It’ll complete Bloomberg. come within hour want chime think hilarious wrote diatribe begging people accept things fact there's evidence, yet one comments, including easily verifiable oft-repeated claims, wrote this:

How spread amongst school?? 

Now know, kids barely symptoms. However, family members teachers also got 3 family members ended hospital.. weird science math works like that. man, gets it! shit. China’s fault hiding covid world silencing “press” doctors telling world nothing wrong. tell get new job, putting people level risk danger. 

just Hell yeah never ever go salary. least industry hourly pay way clearly positioned suggestion

Where get matter decided what, end, chancellor, resposible.

That's weird view make someone responsible something power. want believe shitshow situation, likely get worse. probably starting see deaths days hitting 55-60k cases day. makes sick stomach think ahead. dont understand thought all. Best case scenario, wont spread it.

But even second waiting period, 5-6% still got current vaccines. doesnt count people caught first dose 2 weeks second. doesnt include vaccines less successful.

If get covid, absolutely spread it. Since dont know hat group get/spread it, continue wearing masks even majority vaccinated cant spread sufficient people vaccinated jo linger matters. open secrets best there, catch all. I've searched donations never seen them. 

So least 8, likely much more. Still democrat conducting study would nice see conflict interest. Yeah I've always wondered much could happen go SC people first phase slow get vaccine Governor got annoyed said, “Get get scheduled January 15th move on”. sudden vaccine doses given booked. excited would next phase (SC teachers 1B), they’re saying months. point making ""look shut big dangerous thing!"" single dose appeared “less effective thought”, also lower Pfizer suggested.  contrast, received second dose Pfizer vaccine six- 12-fold increase antibodies post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Well man one powerful world delegate competent people get shit done, that's another story. couple dozen people know got second vaccine, I'd say less half took day work, none anything worse feeling icky half day (usually day shot; worked day day got second shot). Interestingly, nearly women icky feeling. males seem hardly reaction.

Your experience outside norm, fact talking pre-taking anti-inflammatories leads think history things like happening maybe? BIG TRUE /s kind hard 90% violent riots one side yet one media labels a, ""riot"" one side. fact they're even stopping at, ""riot"". They're basically tripping use even stronger terms like, ""insurrection"", ""rebellion"", ""coup"" etc spending whole year ranting terms racist helping conversation. media US absurdly biased something needs said even admittedly best place say it. rate bias one biggest drivers polarization radicalization today certainly belong conversation. people get invited movie/bar/restaurant/club/game/etc. Never said wasn't.

But saying February means...well, February.  mention supply average person.

A request wear masks needed hospital staff.

It basically reads cloth masks work. ""For new variant"" ...

So variant smaller? travel way? Yes, don’t let routine health go shit covid. plan follow state local laws, including mask mandate.

I will, however, hanging vaccinated people going gym without worry well going restaurants establishments open.

I also plan going movies spending fuck-ton time family, also vaccinated. sound almost giddy talking it. 

You finally feel justified talk little care everyone huh! Yay! legal stipulations it, generally study unblinded offer vaccine placebo group. Why? seriously have?

We're home arrest Italy since October.

We sacrificing untold amount resources keep 82 years old alive another year. think take seriously taking currently, would require literally welding people homes like China.  Keep mind, still test things increase variety ALDI Finds, functions trial runs.

If find something that's really good, make sure let know, there's decent chance they'll keep inventory, long sells decently. doesn’t look like they’re applying approval US late March/early April. couple extra months

You really expect anyone buy crap ""two weeks stop spread""? gave inch took mile. point enough enough. We've patient compliant, I'm sorry masks going new normal however much want be. Yup... wait kids vaccine ready 2022... changing anything 14 days second dose (Moderna). I've pretty strict distancing. I'm planning going totally back normal, I'm definitely going bit relaxed. I'll go grocery store instead getting deliveries, see non-elderly friends, get haircut finally, go person doctors visits, etc. biggest thing encouraging non-vaccinated friends risky things. want encourage friends go restaurants me, example. I'm also going put traveling visit family, since there's still risk could catch/spread virus plane. refreshing see downvoted hell once. Maybe sanity prevail all.  article scientific study. article says thing people saying since variant identified; might reason concern. might get struck lightning tomorrow. I’m going concern might happen  could potentially change vaccine open everyone it’s enough time gotten it. know least right requiring vaccine fly would wholly unfair certain segment vaccinated.   Heart attack deaths due COVID, known hemodynamic complications (it thickens blood). Aaahhh.....so. mod.

Okay then. Noted. need study.Simple stuff.How many teachers died year compared last year.Also teachers higher percentage catching virus compared workers dont share room 30 children/teens 5 hours day.I wonder one conducted studies like these. MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. Results efficacy study Epivaccorona anti-coronavirus vaccine developed Vector State Research Center Virology Biotechnology ***will made public February***, center’s director, Rinat Maksyutov, said Tuesday.

""Epivaccorona’s efficiency results made public February. vaccine’s efficacy made immunologic efficacy protective efficacy,"" quoted saying press service Russian sanitary media widely-reported statistics. One statistic leads hospitalizations deaths, reminds people importance protecting getting vaccinated. Yes. get 6 months full pay another 6 months half pay. lucky work public sector job good stuff like this. I'd say majority people situation even close good. 

I'm almost certain though everyone gets 5 days full pay statutory sick pay government pays pittance. really good news most. Doubt many willing continue lockdown restrictions Spring/Summer...  Merkel really messed last months.

No lockdown call. Germany lockdowns decided states, federal government. Merkel would likely strict lockdown September waited November implement semi-lockdown. Buy expensive reuseable mask like B2 mask...all need replace filters Thank voice reason. 

I feel like masks become fashion accessory people also makes feel superior others want let go. personally can't wait mask burning parties summer! old r u? Agreed! Isn’t whole point vaccination “herd immunity” (via vaccination) stop spread disease? Isn’t disagree anti-vaccine people? increase spread disease since they’re vaccinated? Lol. definitely die! relatively mild case, actually (lingered month though). What's scary this? western countries nearly racist hateful israel/israelis are. relatively common belief cities laws prevent non-jews moving them.   dramatic family 😆   soon get vaccinated I’m going summer holiday Israel ... problem wife family think I’m idiot wanting get done.  please tell Cuomo botched it. seems like t_d here. Ireland, apart stupid 2 weeks December we've constant lockdown since late September Well... He's right... Pretty depressing world live AOC rich? idiot. wpuld done ot start wpuldnt mes.
plus healthcare shortages years  is, definition, pandemic. different chicken pox running class, be? somewhat related [Betteridge's law Bravo....and wait shmuck country provide enough doses vaccination willing it.   Virtual Olympics, every athlete competes clock isolation can’t actually deport them, unfortunately. ""catastrophic moral failure"" always there, exposed times crisis.

There's much talk racism days. Racism subset tribalism fundamental human survival trait. times tough, advantageous hoard resources. Resources = survival. resources plentiful, *suppress* racist tendencies share resources others.

But racism always there. *Everyone's* racist, hide better others. racist deep down, human.

Who help shit hits fan?

1) family.

2) tribe.

3) Rest world.

In case, EU prides great healthcare system. Yet, evil US healthcare system produced double number administered vaccines compared EU, despite US smaller population size. Lock up. Fuck em selfish entitled mouth breathers 😭😭😭😭 objectives order priority UK vaccination programme are:

1. Avoid deaths giving protection vulnerable.
2. Reduce critical care pressure NHS reducing hospitalisations.
3. End community transmission achieving national herd immunity

The first two objectives prioritised current vaccine strategy. strong evidence first vaccine dose provides good (near complete) protection severe cases leading hospitalisation/death even stop infection completely. 

The second dose necessary end community transmission mild infections, first two objectives take priority urgency current situation.  Probly not, unless governor NY makes superspreader events nursing homes mandatory don’t take advice?

Generally: hardcore measures like lockdowns shown success. many months lockdowns come end - society economy collapsing western countries - may visible yet time come soon.

Democracy danger supressing critical skeptical professionals.  sociopath huge ego Either crushed curve, cases explode like crazy sometime future. Weirdly enough stay place mostly every person wears mask, around 7/10 people.  useless fact phone? Well yeah, right.

I 30 weeks pregnant doctor advised would fine isolate together small child wouldn’t understand couldn’t together/may infected live small house. basically said level exposure already had/lack risk factors, wasn’t much point putting child much stress. 

I actually never ended testing positive virus continued sharing king sized bed. precaution took distancing other’s faces, kissing, sharing food drinks, etc. I’m sure already gotten pretty big exposure either way knew positive.

Oh btw 100% support lockdowns restrictions still. Businesses fail everyday. Human lives important property. shown 90% effective too! That's really great news! Apparently people downvote hear someone something agree with. Good them, what’s strategy reopening borders? can’t stick zero covid strategy forever. Even require vaccination enter country, people inevitably bring virus since there’s always 5% people vaccine isn’t effective for. can’t public health messaging sane? Lolol epyc racism funy XD XD  exactly line would expect someone Watertown. Doubly wife soldier. No, 400k *reported*.

You use favorite categorization system define technology. depends count. around 24 take 9 million people. exclude 2 million people 16 years old people already infected, around 30 percent It’s funny assume anyone obviously staged pandemic automatically American. Sounds like 2nd dose important

I think say based data. Rise antibodies suggests first dose worked immune system responding second dose would virus. (Getting infected also causes rise antibodies since created needed.)

Delaying reasonable. explanation RNA virologist: know Pfizer's Global Research Development Center Vaccines is?

they manufacturing capability too. Well start fatality rate much different, within 6% US whole.

Open bars clubs increases transmission virus necessarily deaths. everyone gets dies, deaths very, heavily concentrated elderly pre-existing conditions. probably people going bars clubs.

Also find cases matters. testing bunch young healthy people going find bunch positive cases turn fatalities. test people nursing homes it'll opposite.

This good article shows skewed risk population, literally thousands times higher high-risk group low-risk know. I'm saying report shows 0 signs improvement. Hopefully tomorrow Wednesday do. I'm surprised. letting people know posted No, lack empathy. say ""I'm sorry"" feel good yourself, failing use words properly. look apology used, well condolence. 
Your ignorance ludacris. understand that. I'm saying roll going bad report report shows signs improvement. expected well. also people saying stuff like ""once get 60s vulnerable done, covid over!"" stupid, see lot sub, though everyone 60 happy get infected, think nothing huge sections society suddenly long-term health issues.   husband knew CPR implanted defibrillator!

The fact charge tests moronic. That’s fucked like look San Francisco shut even nyc Florida 100% open, restrictions they’re 19%? Viruses mutate replicate, deadliness doesn’t much unless impacts replication. Look post history posted links another thread.  used know, 8th vaccine injection last week, seem forgetting stuff.

Obligatory: / s. think business putting money need (getting people vaccinated) solid group. also vaccinated yet I'm eligible yet. Likewise remote villages worry getting infected, like Tristan Da Cunha optimism well-founded. numbers science speak themselves- truly homestretch. Granted, nothing guaranteed, suppose, based purely facts evidence, going seeing normalcy soon spring goes according plan. It’s exciting, definitely something optimistic about! understand cautiously optimistic though, virus truly unpredictable times. But, ask me, I’m feeling pretty sweet coming months :) Sorry UN, countries improve local economies want afford modern medicine. Poor countries can’t really expect charity given ahead taking care families communities. yeah, that's thing well. I'll go friends house go friends small breweries make lost time, patient going bigger events get vaccinated. miss going sounders games, able hang freely friends need pretty much time. maybe screaming local state officials hurry get shots arms.

Let's realistic. many states police said flat enforce masking ordinances. said public health problem involve criminal intent. No? restrict travel places active community spread. somewhere active spread vaccinated, sorry travel without quarantine. 


Its simple. Several countries eradicated domestic case load. hard, vaccines get much easier. countries decide even bare minimum _should_ feel excluded normal travel disgusting petri dishes pandemic continue. thought Trump administration's plan dole vaccine states vaccinating efficiently? This. actually impact spread, would know now.

No, wouldn't. variants still make small proportion total particles sequenced. prevalent, expect see majority sequences made new variants.

Whether they're 50-60% transmissible little impact overall case numbers. 2 billion dollars help poor countries get covid vaccine... happened? hope vaccine approved children, understand come conclusion. Even highest hospitalization rate mentioned, 33.7 per 100,000 quite rare. Oof! heard many coworkers side effects like day. long til felt back normal? yes!!! I’d take 24-48 hours immune response covid hands That’s I’m bloody glad participated trial. either got shots fall getting March (depending got placebo fall). 

I’ve taking seriously, I’ll continue considerate, also want start dating see family. Ain’t seen face face year. Knowing I’m protected make much comfortable that. 

I pray Biden’s administration figure shit out. make polio eradication campaign look like child’s play. guns blazing, shots arms, go go go. sooner get critical mass vaccinated sooner safely get back normal. They’ve studied South African variant enough dramatic, it’s definitely looking good right initial assessment. There’s lot transmission lot chances virus respond pressures evolve vaccine effectiveness. one enjoys structural racism, loot stores burn buildings? least 30% infected far according CDC (91 million December 2020): Honestly, hope so. Fauci consistent saying people US likely keep wearing masks social distancing herd immunity reached. zero evidence variants exist render vaccines useless. 

Have noticed “new variants” headlines didn’t start getting published immediately vaccines approved first administered?

Many mild (“probably allergies”) asymptomatic (kids especially) complete failure test NY,New Orleans, early outbreaks etc. screwed true case count permanently. basically around 30% population exposure get nearly 30 million vaccinated month things keep going. That’s 40% immunity (obviously overlap, people right vaccine well) overall creeping there. States like ND,WV, canaries coal mine actually true. far, there’s reason doubt it.  Yeah. news article makes seem never got virus. upon reading further, less affirms yet still ask got virus one, time, interaction strangers daily basis guy got vaccine.
Either way, fingers crossed. average 17/100,000 children hospitalized. rare. par odds child aged 0-14 dying given year cause.

Damn spring summer gonna looking real nice 😉 USA hospital census, usually affected holidays, 5% week week, last days.  


123,848 people hospitalized covid 7% peak Jan. 6 lowest number since Jan. 2. 


I hopeful vaccines targeting vulnerable populations begin see effect, hospitalizations drop even faster cases. Actually, time due get second dose (about month in) already probably 80-90% protection. second dose booster mainly longevity. first dose pretty damn effective wait month. That’s one reasons considered saving second doses people vaccines always coming. It’s Pfizer Moderna tested two doses, that’s protocol stick two. 

They’re damn good vaccines.

Edited add: yes still get Covid right get first dose. need wait it’s still really effective first dose month. suspend vaccine miralax? What? Go one one states. state population going ones 50th line going break news them? backwards. EU country wants close borders (or anything really), that. example Poland Hungary busily dismantling democracy rule law - going take lot effort EU level put stop that.  Tuscaloosa already fucked up. surprise. It'll least 40k summer, way things going. news necessary, many think ensure cannot stop infecting others Covid, least try infect others absurd ideas.

Cases declining week they’re nowhere near time highs. want say you’ve fantastic comments here. Agree 100%. less severe influenza aged 0-9. age group statement true. progress age groups, COVID becomes significantly dangerous influenza. boat

hhmmmm.... workaround?  Hopefully leaders west don’t give China benefit doubt next time.. less severe flu children. question point. Hospitalization death rates COVID lower flu. how?  story Sun blocked moderators said essentially thing, details, concurred Swiss TV report today. 12 cases including hotel staff 300 quarantined. Ski lifts still open. work eat healthy diet, shouldn’t worry statistic reasonable genetics. 

But nah, people want lazy demand healthcare take care health-related problems instead putting work avoid situation first place. Apparently actually supposed better delay bit so, China report WTO December 31st? continue keep lid it? make sense report it. shut Wuhan Hubei province quarantine 50 million people January April? could done nothing. means people care less trying avoid getting sick pre-pandemic times.

I'm little confused. see 330,000 doses distributed, many administered? Concerning nonetheless. suggesting tourism industry international travel restricted banned decades? Thats totally unfeasible Mind link post staying positive good news vaccines? It’s also worth noting risk immunocompromised drops dramatically people vaccinated. virus can’t propagate community easily people vaccinated. 

This literally point concept herd immunity it’s infuriating antivax dipshits caused outbreaks stuff like measles.  massive Type 2 error. False negative. countries want believe could happen, looking at. 

Normally institutions worried Type 1 error - false positive, false alarm. However, pandemic threat viruses rare. six serious threats *we know about* since 2003. One suppressed (SARS 2003), three become efficient enough (H5N1, H7N9, MERS), two went worldwide (2009 H1N1, COVID). many potential threats tier down.

2009 H1N1 happened mild real takeaway fast pandemic flu-like illness move. 

There substantial chance alarm real. way that’s control.

This key part makes seem much reasonable people make posts sentiment. seems like asymptomatic spread mostly thing, presymptomatic spread much thing. case masks &amp; restrictions sick still strong. I'm social fuck, use go every weekend. Ever since started ONCE.. why? I'm selfish piece shit jeopardizes around him. That's good reason, good explanation deserves sympathy. However respect still valid excuse trying live life make receptors meet.. Yea. mean watching Cuomo’s daily press conferences spring summer fall seem morphed trump bashings actually informative press conferences. believe trying make case trump perfect this. definitely issues too. Suit quite side effects second dose. Headache, 101 degree fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, racing heartbeat. Still better covid though! vaccine wouldn’t cause symptoms like right? Sorry, babies, ""didn't know drive limit"" get speeding ticket either. gonna weird take.

People apocalypse-posting Christmas/New Year surge gonna obliterate us all.

Cases dropping can't help feel slightly smug apocalypse *hasn't* happened. county says every adult wants get July 15th. People forgives George’s Floyd. man, sir? two biggest missteps every single country cutting international travel together immediately mass testing WITHOUT symptoms start. would much smaller problem far data occurred. subreddit fear! Fearrrrrrr! I'm WI strange. Spike started labor day, little bump Thanksgiving decline since. Thing definitely got bad large gatherings like labor day, protests motorcycle rally's/events. cold there's none activities happening... Way less cases. see things going back weather gets warmer vaccination continues failure. Sounds like can't handle politicians side criticized. remember chatting coworkers January it. recall wondering countries take seriously. Granted-countries outside Asia treated like SARS claimed could never happen home countries. Boy we're wrong. /s cowards afraid imaginary internet points. Interesting see sub turned /r/The_Donald_Coronavirus. Open country, NOW!

He right said disappear like miracle. liwenliang (he eye doctor) spread unconfirmed information friends. first doctor report analysis Zhang jixian, head Respiratory ICU department. Yeah. know. I’m saying astmptomatic / symptomatic conversation isn’t user replying actually trying refer to. It’s rate immunity infection. know dramatically reduces symptoms, least healthy enough trials. problem is, policies based fear asymptomatic spread, studies indicate mostly thing, **admitting** obviously wipes entire case masks &amp; restrictions us aren’t sick. So, left confusing spot. mean honestly appointments second doses made first administered doubt happening.

Regardless least record many first shots administered 21 days ago vaccination sites. trivial project many doses need 2nd doses weeks advance.

The problem Cuomo good making threats stiff penalties circumvent distribution protocols, see enforce anything distribution network expanding.

A local K-mart pharmacy vaccines according vaccination finder portal, never answered phone trying get appointment elderly parent. Appointment dates ""filled"" appointment websites even go public. 100% I'm convinced many distribution sites whatever want. 

It point average person resign waiting everyone ""hook-up"" get doses maaaaybe get vaccine. rate spring move past 65+, education workers, firefighters, first responders, police, transit workers anyone else lucky enough job union political clout.

Oh well. get sick guess. think well handling pandemic side things, vaccine rollout great. reason appointments made vaccines even shipped out. reason all. 

Otherwise begging people crooked incompetent. going now. find picture thumbnail curious. bunch tables seat 5. put one end one table. one middle next table. back sides, etc. makes sense.

I'm usually optimistic, noticed Illinois, hospitalizations dropping pace number deaths day. Someone tried reason body bags leaving hospital, clearly they're right, damn, moment realization pretty harsh.

Imagine black gym owner. Would still say this? Chill. People time get bent shape research studies. 

You know research studies wrong right? fact research studies tend wrong right time. 

Studies need verified put weight them. study needs repeated several times least one group prove study correct. 

Most time studies fail verification process skipped important step original study therefore invalidating study. 

The point study says XYZ mean true littered false claims.

Ummm that's simply cannot case freaking all. fatality rate, would mean deaths really 1 million now.

Not vague estimates CDC (which constantly failed literally anything whole pandemic beyond useless, trust word anymore), even says data September. 20 lakh = 2 million  someone lives japan. No, strict all. government wisdom thought 2020 great time start big tourism campaign, constantly downplayed covid. Surprising one covid back force (especially tokyo), alot Japanese people care much covid Caus government suga downplaying much.

We state emergency mainly involves asking businesses close bit earlier, pathetic. Yall forgetting Chinese new year lunar new years. bunch people gonna traveling early middle February. matters daily deaths, cause globally thousands new cases, deaths drops govs stop caring Israel, lockdown joke... people continue gathering usual, that's main reason increased infections byproduct tribalism echo chambers.  Around level Hong Kong Flu 50 years ago: obviously much higher population. Maybe divide world two distinct societies: want keep going indefinitely want move on. assign three continents group. way would get want. EU must see terribly America handled virus lol entitlement disgusts me. lot..... That's I'm concerned lack uptake vaccine. Figure asymptomatic take symptomatic won't.

This exactly think pandemic much sooner projections indicate right now. Different Aldi's. Trader Joe's connected American Aldi chain. Wow I'd assume would HEB everywhere like San Antonio.

I love WinCo, here. resources effectiveness ratings 7 vs 10 vs 14 day quarantines, following guidelines length? Give vaccine time take effect. people got first dose couple weeks ago.

You could give people hundred doses help one bit got infected within couple days, already infected (and pre-symptomatic) vaccinated all.

Israel one worst outbreaks world New Year period, cases start come 12 days getting vaccinated (bear mind incubation period here). inevitable lot people going turn positive soon getting first dose. going problem world tho, people think it’s magic bullet cease taking precautions. everyone adhered advice, pandemic would quicker, won’t. treat vaccine magic bullet forget shit that’s kept safe till now!  line work employer actually forced treat like human in-demand it’s pretty great. leave run errand middle day worry clocking out. Basically widespread profession that’s like America software engineering though. previous employer eventually put call rotation laughed, collected last wave stock said bye Felicia. pretty much work anywhere skill set make good wage salary actually becomes benefit instead detriment co-worker whose mom tested positive summer around Christmas.

I think reinfection rate low widespread thing going tons cases people get twice. also underwears laying around. I'll send some. ""Taxing corporations based profits instead revenues form communism""

That's new take heard before. And? Force Publique owned Leopold II, actions individual Nigerians preferred mercenaries contracted foreign nations die starvation British controlled Nigeria equiparable systematic genocide enslavement dozen nations west greatly profited it. low risk kids 

You honestly know this. Stop saying this. idea future ramifications may body. Simply asymptomatic mildly symptomatic primary infection means nothing overall effect person. number whites Leopold’s Congo never around 3000 get claimed number every white man would personally kill like four half thousand Africans ppl declining, wonder percentage already virus. increasing reports this, never anything mentions kind intersection. downvoted including lot ifs, pros heavily outweighs cons.

No one risking vaccinating people reducing shit storm comes (economics, hospitals, panic, lockdown, etc) chance new strain contained vaccine imported deadly first waves. 1-2 year time frame.


So want massively vaccine everyone country open back ""normal"" 2-4 months, share vaccines world hope job done within year best. 

Plus screenings continue long time, get harder already halfway ending pandemic turf. Smh. TBH, speculated US intelligence agencies knew circulating virus China Beijing did? struggle imagine central government Beijing could would want act sufficient speed bureaucratic agility coverup tiny novel outbreak time look much different countless common diseases (like flu). likely provincial government calling shots, experience local governments country anything go by, local governments tend hide things would otherwise central government come like sack bricks.

Still really know travel ban implemented earlier though. said, I'm sure travel lockdown would well accepted means foreigners Wuhan able leave... Yes, Aldi good easy propaganda campaign.  act moving essential? wrote book beat COVID crisis, middle said crisis. One week? That's lot people profession passing away month, ONE WEEK. wonder profession makes particularly stricken virus? Could constant gatherings strangers indoors? going easy answer here. mean, basically same. Government money magic free money.  Hahaha, EU rules apply. withdrawal agreement applied. 

The withdrawal agreement literally says EU rules applied transition. Thanks demonstrating honesty/character sure, may well optional program. it’s unusual member states broken ranks protect populations don’t think? it’s optional.

The program gets better prices negotiating block, etc. Quite reflective shit deals UK getting internationally. say tits, Eric.  Chiefs game packed could Sunday too. Would love see pikachufaces.jpg see we're India lol

Well 200K active cases we're halfway normal saying ""by summer"" tomorrow

Then probably 2022 Friday virus issues environment protective gene another thing risk gene COVID? one city, extrapolating cause hard without data virus infected huuuuuge gut feeling, anti-maskers take offensively probably deface Memorial. thought previously herd immunity "" real thing"". would they? Force Publique consisted mostly African mercenaries 
Notably Hausa warriors northern Nigeria.
Read history book. Deaths follow hospitalizations, drive them. First new cases peak, hospitalizations, deaths. western baby Thats pretty bullshit. surging everywhere people dying faster rate course vaccination number focus right now. stops surging completely logical saying ""hey people dying faster good news vaccinations!""

More people dying bigger important story one needs keep hammered people stay fuck home. I'm trying defend WHO, I'm simply pointing proposal stop travel *between* European countries Feb 2020

a) Never would happened

b) done anything anyway absent mitigations, *many still done Europe January 2021* (like centralized quarantine cross border contact tracing).

This Europe saw infections falling summer used time nothing except encourage citizens travel surprised pikachu face infections shot fall.

There's magical words could said direction would made Europe's COVID response less shitshow certainly advocating intra-Europe travel bans.  expert really believe vaccinated people would able spread virus.

The logic makes perfect sense. I've vaccinated measles. can't spread measles. I've vaccinated polio tetanus. can't spread diseases either. Given immune response know invoked covid vaccine seems logical covid vaccine would prevent spread well. leaders step job? US issues deal with. reading comments feel incredibly blessed work city do. paying fully vaccine get ton PTO point stupid stuff like even cross mind more, took day second round work day. leave go take shot come back, issue. said running fever following days take work, paid city using PTO. center positive case dropped essential personnel could distance people sent home days still paid here. kids keep rising Seems first dose "" first dose Pfizer vaccine offers less protection COVID-19 US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer originally claimed, Israel's coronavirus czar told Hebrew media Tuesday.

Imo Gottlieb cueing financial markets lower expectations back financial positions Pfizer Moderna. spent quarters 3 &amp; 4 2020 ICE podcast (ICE financial industry platform works NYSE) talking stocks indirectly. board Pfizer. He’s former FDA chief quit May 2020 take lucrative position. (Think btw ). 

Now, IMO, he’s going held accountable financial industry likely relied him, big shot former FDA chief, he’s indirectly telling everyone cut losses.  People going lose money Gottlieb likely covering himself. 

Imo Gottlieb, fellow Pfizer board members, Wall Street investors markets podcast, grossly underestimated intelligence many people.  

I think show Interest Pfizer Moderna vaccines vaccines, general. given gravity Covid relative flu, there’s comparing data. Many take risk flu, opt vaccines, eagerly accept safe, effective proven vaccine Covid.  certainly will! question. It’s vaccine fear, it’s mRNA. 

Safe effective keys. last thing need another health problem 2021. think many delaying vaccination Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines mRNA vaccines Without proven record safety reliability. Many willing continue isolate wait safe, effective alternative Johnson &amp; Johnson Oxford/az. 

And frankly data they’ve released missing vital information would give people confidence. It’s marketing proper assuming we’d trust unsupported conclusions mislead agencies like CDC spent months even discouraging mask use, questioned airborne nature, etc. safe effective could’ve establish publishing detailed data reassure people. 

For instance, didn’t conduct weekly Covid-19 tests subjects Oxford? test symptomatic subjects determine efficacy rate mRNA ? determine someone symptomatic? Also, count neutralizing antibodies, geometric mean titer, day 29? Day 57? second dose ? J&amp;J provided data. can’t find Pfizer. Moderna. unsupported adjectives describing numbers like “substantial” data find. ? go much. Rarely go another store something small. felt like spokes person talking parents Aldi's love going. Herd immunity achievable via vaccination. look traditional herd immunity developed livestock, you’d know form herd immunity requires everything die die. can’t human beings. way see us getting herd immunity US government companies pay people get vaccine. many people even pro vax said skip vaccine. financial incentive. Yup that's need, less nurses Aldi shit. love store  Good, least info it. even know phase 3 is? phase 1 2 for? rationale approving Covaxin? SAT predictive measure future success anything used college admissions. far useless. Grades meaningless since different schools use drastically different grading schemes. standardized test absolutely required students different schools compared objectively. Depends... sit behind glasses wear masks... Sometimes. explains covid sense smell: heard people retraining server smell, I'm sure technique. Worth Google? Nobody said definitively less effective... say least less effective fully effective.

The one thing say rendered useless.   2 develop enough antibodies- one immunocompromised young healthy explanation high levels antibodies mean, get it. say that? It’s lot better purposely callous low key racist human beings suffering pandemic worse conditions us. It’s honestly heartless disgusting. 

I impatient get vaccine too, recognize extremely privileged even ten months countries world may never recover Covid. Deaths lagging indicator, cases dropping since December. reason think daily deaths keep climbing.  also shows could happen nature enhanced lab - must also change.  Otherwise, like Maginot Line protecting part threat.   appears understand human psychology better 95% world governments. 

I don’t know work, almost certainly making enough. 😂 seriousness, relieved see posted sub, certainly hope “the powers be” (eventually? Seriously f*cking long need??!) figure out.  made mistakes masks immunity. We’re now. distort information try scare people compliance, misinformation undermines us future ways didn’t expect. vaccine widely **available** total right say fuck everyone else I'm gonna go live life.

People **refuse** take vaccine still die COVID herd immunity reached that's **our** problem. 

Everyone responsible health, family member friend refuses take vaccine want hang w/o masks, refuse get 2 shots. sure actually watch/read news much seen reported every major online cable news source I've seen lately. focus relevant important, bad news.

Focus also important part journalism. news stories matter equally.

Perhaps getting news algorithmically driven sources sources think like angry? see articles bashing California time, remember lot articles talking Cuomo botching early days.

Can’t shitty? Desantis also says lot callus bs seems justified call pos. shoe fits, speak. 14 day quarantine, say get test want safe it’s negative, good go. Presumably amount 300k used batch pulled. Maybe even it. categorically false, based reddit history posting Alex Jones conspiracies, think willing accept sort facts rebuke claim. vaccine approved.

I Pfizer placebo group. week got EUA, called asked wanted unblinded... said yes... Siblings partner got call (3/4 us got placebo!).

They scheduled us come in, day. L452R affects spike proteins virus - mechanism used mRNA vaccines. strategy keep chatter ensures blissfulness. bleak announcement comes amid pressure NHS complete vaccinations among care home staff residents, government’s intended goal Sunday, deaths care facilities jumped 46 per cent last week. ""Spector serving 19-year sentence prison murder Lana Clarkson passed away."" Remember people screaming “once hits India it’s game over”. Lol, wonder decency humility admit wrong.  hope pray properly get vaccinated return normal. vaccines role quickly get point immunized. 

I hope pray leadership takes right steps ensure proper measures place lower exposure COVID, get immunized. folks think illegal speech considered free speech. Go figure. president actually acknowledges people died Covid. Wait, what? wtf rubbish spouting? I'd regard fairly optimistic person grounded reality. found number internet myths going around even among educated people. downplaying possibility coronavirus pandemic could echo events 1918 Influenza pandemic virus mutating harmful form. I'm sorry wealthy countries first number reasons:

1. helped develop vaccine

2. Older population higher obesity rate risk younger, healthier populations developing countries

3. Second-order effects shutdowns developed countries hurts developing countries. Commerce aid developing countries slowed wealthy countries able resume activity

Saying Americans Europeans send vaccines developing countries helping people something sounds nice theory, absolutely idiotic practice. ""This article preprint certified peer review [what mean?]. reports new medical research yet evaluated used guide clinical practice."" also going research “We’re delighted provided generous support program,” said Barouch, added lab’s $2.5 million fund research immune responses COVID-19 diseases. think people would reacted number given beginning outbreak. Instead got lies. Well maybe that's country can't deal covid well China can? simple concept can't believe get it. Yes please!! Agree disagree :) 50% response variant kind big deal, dr Feigl, respected epidemiologist, agrees. weeks, 4000 people dying day. comparison, around 7,100 americans die everyday due variety causes. Germany cashiers sit behind plastic windows register wear mask all... really understnding.

Wealthier countries going hoarding ton vaccine production. That's point article. countries bought supplies send countries. reason overbought cause want guarantee largest amount quickest. that, they've taken away vaccines smaller countries purchase wait larger countries finish vaccinations send supplies smaller countries.

&amp;nbsp;

I see merits both. buying regular allotment everyone everyone gets vaccinated pace, less. buy lot assure ""*your*"" people get vaccine first send others. leaders help country sideeffect. 

&amp;nbsp;

for example, who's truly getting vaccinated now? THere's many countries vaccinations others wait march/april/may/june start. reason wealthier countries purchased allotments instead leaving amounts countries. thatt woulld mean less vaccines wealthy country.

&amp;nbsp;

Kind see wealthy people countries start get vaccines first rest population. happening country scale vaccine distribution. 1610 deaths. Equivalent 7808 US.

Its going get worse least next week, expect broken times absolute shit show here.

R.I.P souls, ones ones sadly come.  Standing outside helping people load groceries quarters pays great too.  Please tell selfish irresponsible I’ll retract said. I’m anti-masker, however haven’t seen legitimate scientific studies said wearing mask / socially distancing even gotten vaccine going kill / infect others. yes, things getting better sure.

the deaths always follow cases though, we're rough couple weeks Cool I'm pretty sure enough money thrown covid globally. severely underfunded diseases like tuberculosis... Currently friendly countries hostile neighbouring countries. Every country would that. cases reducing deaths increasing :( Gtfo anti-vaxx conspiracy theories. Getting mine Bellevue Friday!!!  think I'll ever stop wearing mask this. use subway system NYC. And, setting foot public transport unless wear mask. Even well everyone vaccinated COVID surges thing past. 

Also, I'll avoiding crowded places well good while; busy bars, movie theaters, packed restaurants, etc. I'll social go out, crowds - thanks. 

COVID proved can't handle clean... like all. Imagine cooperated virus 1st broke out? would done with. And, talking lock downs. initial attempts limiting spacing seating public places like restaurants bars. Nope - one listened cases COVID surged. 

People want cooperate. So, I'll whatever best health. Good news tag? Hey listen say want standardized testing, got top 20th percentile got state school. say sure GPA. seem indicate general aptitude specific knowledge. make arguments grades, they’re entirely subjective aren’t good comparison tool students different schools. lol that's said all, fuckwit.

The damage done. take year two get back were.

Getting people vaccinated magically speed year two process.

Jesus, people like blow mind reactive generally ignorant are. Except realize articles sourcing FL based right?

Here's try use ""whataboutism"" much want. Difference beliefs based factless opinions, locally sourced articles talking DeSantis real piece shit, response pandemic equally shitty. budget $4.4B 2019 less hospitals US.

12 mill budget day single hospital? what? Even average person get's 100$ hour, 24/7 1000 people working hospital , still 2,4 million day ... f missing here? hospital like big city, 500000 patients what? What's sad depressing actually preventable people idiots selfish. generally true. might case shops go masked cashiers. Hold beer! -WWIII  Sure would nice articles contained actual data. Southern CA. fuckton people. work someone who's twice. People call anecdotal much want think reinfections unlikely say are. That's got vaccine soon could even though I've already covid. Okay... fuck kids position taking? Wish could upvote 100 times. china well Yep major player Twitter might reasonable concerned. also time find new job. I'm honestly surprised nursing homes forcing liability reasons. idea although deaths suicides, ODs, etc up, deaths things like car accidents down. time causes like cancer likely stay same. 

Other causes like maybe heart attack victim couldn’t get adequate/timely care covid strain may added death toll look back study pandemic. 

Either way it’s estimate shows quite clearly undercounting covid deaths, one time, doesn’t give perfect number far exactly are. Exactly. First dose you’re supposed act like never got it. People think they’re invincible instant first dose vaccine injected arm. fun finally talk topics without mentioning ""But UK got exemption ..."". 120% figure speech said reporters convey safe. exactly official report Phase 1 2 crap say Reactogenicity absent majority participants, mild events. majority adverse events mild resolved. One serious adverse event reported, found unrelated vaccination. three vaccine formulations resulted robust immune responses comparable panel convalescent serum. 


Once again, please shut hell don’t talk things clue about. People like blood hands, convincing people get vaccinated. ashamed. Pfizer vaccine. Tried get oldest clinic trial, filled less day. Testing done 12-16 March. sick days? get sick days something I've heard US. take whenever want even sick? sample small extremely fucking fortunate. 

Once again. don’t clue. Dude, takes 12 days develop antibodies. Stop dramatic it. haven’t offered vaccine. Good questions... would provided link could done. distinctly recall reading paper within past couple days, longer find it. cohort 80 strong immune response infection, 80 7/15 failed provide response days tested. first injection, clearly numbers small.

I mention surprised response bad, seem common knowledge - maybe plain wrong, I've seen many results roll vaccines, course quite references people unfortunately died, apparently research showing connection actual vaccine, people frail immune response vaccine tipped edge. Yeah that's big question vaccine effectiveness calculation. Trial blinded participants going way careful vaccinated general public seems likely effectiveness # drop covid becomes less prevalent. boat.

Waited got vaxxed... got second shot, plan starting gum 2 weeks don’t worry anymore. 

I’m already significantly calm without existential dred. quit going work, know it! China still power either way. Without actual numbers, really hard make heads tails this.  aMeRiCuN eXcPsHUnAliZm Yeah. ‘Get vaccine you’re fired’. That’s incentive many companies seems like great one. meant limit spread virus hospitals get overwhelmed, meant contain virus. honest answer really sure. less now, much, know. fast. indoors ever now. lot states lifting tighter restrictions. Probably best ask daily discussion thread. appropriate place know place till moved South grandma told lol loves it... need get? There's one street. :D also limit average work time 40 h week EU, law. can't speak behalf every state, Midwest, every state peaked Thanksgiving decline since.  Week Virology Clinical Update #45. Dr Griffin talks increase deaths coming increasing numbers (i.e. 200,000+ positive cases day). daily deaths americans pretty easily googled. know Aldi global chain still little bit weird hear they're America well. people dumping links reinfection stories like kind gotcha wild we've known months reinfection *rare* never said impossible get twice. 

when 100 million probable cases US lead quite them. 

then people swearing got twice ""got really sick"" last February tested positive fall. everything covid!! hostile country Pakistan though. Vaccines sent Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Myanmmar, Oman, Phillipines, Srilanka. would classify every type death higher mean covid death. going hit record number Suicides, Overdoses, etc.

I'm fully board counting covid deaths since directly caused pandemic, restrictions thier effects numbers tenth now, over-55 crowd largely vaccinated, there's reason go back normal. going doc even time many cases, least doc time clock, fully payed long work least 2 hours day. 
In full day care cases, rely one unlimited sick days :-) Sorry mean changing standpoint, lawmakers, hear tv, news, etc. fiancée works hospital got second Pfizer shot 11 days ago. behavior work definitely changed terms comfortable worried walks room Covid positive. 

I tell home she’s less stressed almost back normal. course there’s still chance pass me, least half battle won. need wait bit longer get shot (30, healthy male) maybe get sense normalcy again. would like give data. FDR great despite disability, Yeah, vaccines pretty fast vaccine reduce transmission, anybody 55 get it?

.... almost certainly reduce transmission, fact there's [a front page sub right says does.

It's time put away line reduce transmission, feeding antivaxer sentiment, cost lives. Yes Let's remember politicians promised normal Christmas guts backtrack. determined 52% effective single dose trial. Cool, get vaccinated? appointments high-risk individuals. Last week usually 130 ET. went hospital brother get tested, tested positive tested negative.  grandma got first dose yesterday! People need wait 2 weeks 2nd shot going out. 80, odds die two week period unless critically ill minimal. 

Can go ahead provide average life expectancy someone ~80 one comorbidity? deaths COVID. There's debate outside moonbat conspiracy theories.

That's CDC says.

~94% deaths one comorbidity, meaning something else wrong addition positive covid test. 

~6% covid single source traditional Valentine's day orgies?

What? Maybe that's me. Especially UK. They’ve done outstanding job! Im high covid areas people dying due substandard care, optimal methods less important reducing hospitalkzation even little bit.

Getting peak key right much world, get infections months ahead result, big deal we'll hopefully medical capacity deal better.


And need revaccinate months, that's fine we'll getting way doses. That's lame Go away!  companies found yet another route getting name front consumers. 

“Hey remember us? reason think we’re good guys come buy stuff ya know?” true. 

Here policy advice 24 February:

""Recommendations international traffic

WHO continues advise application travel trade restrictions countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.

In general, evidence shows restricting movement people goods public health emergencies ineffective situations may divert resources interventions.""

And advice never actually changed. June, ""reopening international transport"". 

Sorry, consistently behind events. mostly ignored sidelined, advice mostly useless, retrospect, plain wrong. country told restaurants hotels open May, expect european countries Fuck yeah aldi disagree. like they're putting huge ""Mission Accomplished"" banner. They're pausing normally happy/exciting times recognize incredible scale agony country gone thus far, without really reflecting it. 

It done hopefully help return feeling numbed numbers cannot visualize hundreds thousands (which most) help combat Covid fatigue, hopefully saves encouraging thoughtful behavior. Someone enjoy Flintstones vitamins Shut dumb bot Monday's low numbers probably due holidays. Look Tuesday Weds unusually high numbers. shut November 2019 ""first case found"" /s would happening trial well? Considering much airlines want travel volume go ASAP, probably domestic flights. International another story would country/airline basis. Gosh, better. It. Better. Vaccinated people know work? made money worked lol  new strain affecting kids more? surprise would finding it’s less 52% effective(or whatever was). Whether that’s isn’t effective thought people way careless 1st dose treating like immediate full immunity question.

The good news 2nd dose far appear effective it’s supposed be. Things probably open certain rate vaccinations Yup. Regular flu heavy hitter almost regardless age. Parents can’t admit children hospitals. Doctors admit patients, make sense. first point exaggerated reporting might correct. I'm watching studies closely, definitely plausible could approval children get ""Whoever wants it"" phase. release vaccination stats today? ground BIGGEST issue. That’s feeling like. shit  Hmmm...67+16= 83%...what remaining 17%? say Rt 1.25 .4, bit complex? Yeah, Rogen’s podcast among things said 7,000 employees China none died knew wasn’t serious. Meanwhile like hate China keep lot people getting Covid. 

I love point friend Shanghai knows like 3 people Covid since start pandemic. living suburb Pittsburgh know least 60 Covid past month (and crap ton since beginning) found kids represent less 2% hospitalization cases. underrepresented relative make population, safe say little risk group. Thousands population hundreds millions significant. I’d rather poor Norway 500 covid deaths one year vaccination started 2 weeks ago view days back already 23 deaths it. vaccine injected lungs.   say hypocritical people made big fuss ""Wuhan Virus"" refer variants location, still use ""Spanish Flu"". Aw, quite unkind comment. actually didn’t even leave apartment two months still got sick. groceries delivered. places husband went hall garbage chute laundry room (our apartment doesn’t spot connect washing machine). hey, judging others imaginary bad decisions don’t confront harsh reality people everything right still get sick... wait, no, it’s still shitty :) know that? know different strain won’t work current vaccines? It’s likely given bad transmission US right have, sorry post course news newspapers. nobody bothered test something that's **highly** unlikely. fucking back place highest risk population? Kinda like started realized murdering elderly. though? Look dr Eric Feigl's Twitter. tested e484 variant recovered people's sera. 50% response variant 90% great reduction neutralization b117 variant also found. way understand virus “sticky” sticks ACE2 receptors near it. extremely rare breathe virus in, exhale back like cigarette smoke. shed virus like it’s replicating cells would probably create bunch virus also expel way it’s caught droplets heading body.

Disclaimer: personal uninformed opinion meant taken fact. I’m scientific medical field. death rates going already yet?

I think death rates trailing indicator. I'm guessing see infection rates decrease first, hospitalizations decrease, death rates decrease.

I looking forward seeing noticable improvement metrics, feel good see progress, anything really. She’s quoting researchers Duke Human Vaccine Institute. Yes, antibody hang around while, studied first batch volunteers received vaccines early last year antibody levels still good months in, levels eventually drop, would still B cells respond new infections, B cells manufacture antibodies needed. expected effective current future mutations. Remember, spike key virus use unlock cells, changed point antibodies work well anymore, would also lose ability infect cells. reads like bullet. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Theyre laugh leave alone ffs. exactly idea fun either understand it. Yeah basically finger pointing. Cuomo says enough supply suppliers point New York given half doses.

Nobody seems able answer question happening doses given. sitting somewhere? sent place without enough demand? thrown trash? answer question able pick strategy better have. Togo Walmart one three areas, would people still wear masks? Btw seems you'vr argument trying deflect. shows never really ""transparency"".  actually think hospitalizations fatalities drop first elderly vaccinated. cases among young illnesses among elderly. high concentration like 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities 65+ health conditions something like 12-15% population.

There time lag think at-risk population vaccinated, serious illnesses drop significantly. Meanwhile cases continue spread young healthy population vaccinated. live EU confirm lot people getting vaccine, included. 70% vaccinated never happen, especially country 70% people refuse well. ^^ want medical system collapse pushed beyond limits 9 hours ambulance bull shit rabies vaccine ~100% effective started immediately post-exposure. Except covid vaccines vials individual doses. vials vary 5-7 doses. Pfizer atleast. family lives Val Verde county... Shit like makes mad. know science says could care less schmuck sats lie get shamed. completely unethical. 

If lie get fault system broken would get back normal faster went aged based system. Possibly, also likely statistics Africa lacking cases big time.

Most western countries ordered 200% excess jabs. jabs probably go somewhere. little tired ""experts worry"" articles. Sure we're worried think wait facts reporting something.

The early reports vaccines work variants they're studying now. Given number variants found, likely around since beginning never checked. specifically sequence virus found order figure variant while. herd immunity strategy always worst strategy. Lmao live New York City man , still want argue me? I’m crying write comment... words express thankful people like you. Thank hate CCP, one WORLD over. Every country earth tries look good good. Yep. Basically retail stores need bouncers. poll article already subjective, loaded question.

Many people critical lockdowns argue lockdowns work *because* COVID control, restrictions anything.

Meanwhile there's another group people argue need tighter restrictions COVID control.

Both people answer ""yes"" question ""Do think COVID control,"" people looking survey interpret saying, ""70% Americans want government get COVID control.""

It's dishonest, people knew making survey.  No, referring convalescent sera, VACCINES. New York Times came article called ""Underselling Vaccine"" criticized messaging vaccines, well earlier BS health orgs masks. worth, quoted expert really believe vaccinated people would able spread virus. many variants, one transmissible U.K. variant recent months? thought dropped essay like 6 years ago? number vaccines administered per day steadily increasing, assuming would stagnate current rate, especially vaccines approved coming months. weather.com COVID tracker. News me.

What offer others quite comprehensive? use two pretty frequently, along Google's numbers quick I'm always open new sources. Damn. Understandable guess case case - wanted make sure income effected I'm vaccinated need convince people it, campaigns, power example political leaders prominent figures, etc. give up.  Yeah, that's works. insulting media audacity praise Cuomo condemn DeStantis latter handled virus better every possible metric. Oh, didn’t realize swallowed food completely bypassed airway. *Blame train!* think main point lot people sort vaccine indifferent. opposed, going go way way get it. 

Basically time April comes around need make process extremely easy many access points anyone interested go way get it. 

We still achieve high uptake require work pushing vaccine instead relying people come you. agree, another message N95 help might hurt backfired. anybody know restaurant workers fall “food agriculture” phase 1b la county? percentage Democrat senators pro paid sick leave? guess? (Or way find out? list different senators work towards changing..) Poorer countries generally worse hygiene 

This hard fix. blame. Washing one's hands shitting one eats hard task. radically reduces cases symptomatic COVID19, thus far completely eliminated severe cases deaths virus. 

You wear mask social distance population vaccinated although chances getting severely ill dying low, mean give die.   Would Europe acted differently declared pandemic earlier state? personally think so. sun gets old awhile. I’ve lived Arizona 27 years, summers get depressing awhile it’s hot stay outside day go hikes swimming.

110 degree days miserable that’s I’m leaving moving somewhere actual seasons beautiful summers don’t feel like killing self. air quality absolutely horrible now, yes even “nice” months. 

I don’t think AZ habitable couple decades due water shortage climate change summers going get miserable. I’ve seen better nature PNW that’s me. though, think know everything know AZ born raised so. frail enough vaccine reaction causes death, think COVID infection would do? 

* Covid vaccination efforts U.S. need contend Americans don’t want receive shot, Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC.
* “I think get 100 million, maybe 120 million vaccines, demand going get soft,” former FDA chief said.
* “We can’t lose sight take granted everyone wants vaccine,” said.  go ahead get right that, then. Meanwhile, world moving on. extremely old news, brushed idiots think still best hope world pandemic. I'd love hear chief propose way make things equitable (sarcasm).

This impossible task. always inequities. everything. Fighting futile. attached kitchen one fridge instead normal door. way easily reached cooking silence/removal return. Based number flu shots. forgets many health care jobs require flu shots going lot intense demand even younger cohorts, think get 100 million, maybe 120 million vaccines, demand going get soft,” Gottlieb said, basing forecast number U.S. adults received flu shot past year. moderna trial unblinded received first dose last Friday! hard detect clear geopolitical line erratic decisions still president; however, clear g policy means regard.

In classical sense, primarily Russia China use vaccine policy expand influence.

It's likely backfire. Maybe people robots strong feelings losing people. worried something like happening recovered COVID. sense taste smell returned sense smell messed up. almost week, constant smell smoke burning wood. I'm sure would able tell actually smelling smoke not. frustrating read. live New York appointment health clinic get vaccine canceled low supply.  last line article:

"" Therefore, efficacy vaccination seem affected appearance new variants. ""

Compare contrast closing statement headline.

Can come agreement balance pessimism versus honesty while? in, wait peer reviewed study vaccine's efficacy post variant emergence region, scaremongering stories go public less training reading sort things?

Edit : read comment realized discusses herd immunity, vaccination, however, maybe lead that? something little neutral like ' Vaccination, prior infection, may needed curb spread emerging variants'. Little accurate less fear based. show poll asked leading questions? mean? Like years """"""""""""picking quarrels provoking trouble""""""""""""? Well whole point opinion. Scientists US, UK, France, Belgium, South Korea, China, New Zealand, australia, AGREE masks **single** best thing protect worn time around people outside household. literally can't hurt proven incredibly helpful. Deplatform disinformation would good start. 

""Based reports cannot rule common adverse reactions, fever nausea, may contribute serious course fatal outcome frail patients severe underlying diseases,"" said Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician Norwegian Medicines Agency.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s true all, neither Moderna Pfizer trials tested asymptotic patients treatment group. tested prior vaccination participant symptoms. types trials capable delineating asymptotic infection complete protection. industry though strongly believe we’ll eventually able show vaccination either mRNA vaccines confers robust immunity infection, symptomatic infection.  certain point inevitably shift “live risk” model. vaccine available want it. not, that’s you.

So long older at-risk populations sufficiently vaccinated, deaths hospitalizations remain lowered.

Alternatively, may see countries opt requiring vaccinations order participate various facets life - school, work, travel, concerts, etc. sure many countries political appetite though (rightly wrongly). problem persists, certain point damage lockdowns detrimental damage coronavirus. We've already given year lives. 330M years life we'll never get back. 400,000 dead Americans unsustainable, enough cause end society. choose lockdowns forever 5% increase mortality rate, increased mortality rate better. Yeah thanks, getting vaccine allow return normal life personally see benifit taking Here's text:

Early pandemic, many health experts — U.S. around world — decided public could trusted hear truth masks. Instead, experts spread misleading message, discouraging use masks.

Their motivation mostly good. sprung concern people would rush buy high-grade medical masks, leaving doctors nurses. experts also unsure much ordinary masks would help.

But message still mistake.

It confused people. (If masks weren’t effective, doctors nurses need them?) delayed widespread use masks (even though good reason believe could help). damaged credibility public health experts.

“When people feel though may getting full truth authorities, snake-oil sellers price gougers easier time,” sociologist Zeynep Tufekci wrote early last year.

Now version mask story repeating — time involving vaccines. again, experts don’t seem trust public hear full truth.

This issue important complex enough I’m going make today’s newsletter bit longer usual. still questions, don’t hesitate email themorning@nytimes.com.

‘Ridiculously encouraging’
Right now, public discussion vaccines full warnings limitations: They’re 100 percent effective. Even vaccinated people may able spread virus. people shouldn’t change behavior get shots.

These warnings basis truth, it’s true masks imperfect. sum total warnings misleading, heard multiple doctors epidemiologists last week.

“It’s driving little bit crazy,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown School Public Health, told me.

“We’re underselling vaccine,” Dr. Aaron Richterman, infectious-disease specialist University Pennsylvania, said.

“It’s going save life — that’s emphasis right now,” Dr. Peter Hotez Baylor College Medicine said.

The Moderna Pfizer vaccines “essentially 100 percent effective serious disease,” Dr. Paul Offit, director Vaccine Education Center Children’s Hospital Philadelphia, said. “It’s ridiculously encouraging.”

The details
Here’s best attempt summarizing know:

The Moderna Pfizer vaccines — two approved U.S. — among best vaccines ever created, effectiveness rates 95 percent two doses. That’s par vaccines chickenpox measles. vaccine doesn’t even need effective reduce cases sharply crush pandemic.

If anything, 95 percent number understates effectiveness, counts anyone came mild case Covid-19 failure. turning Covid typical flu — vaccines evidently remaining 5 percent — actually success. 32,000 people received Moderna Pfizer vaccine research trial, want guess many contracted severe Covid case? One.

Although rigorous study yet analyzed whether vaccinated people spread virus, would surprising did. “If example vaccine widespread clinical use selective effect — prevents disease infection — can’t think one!” Dr. Paul Sax Harvard written New England Journal Medicine. (And, no, exclamation points common medical journals.) Twitter, Dr. Monica Gandhi University California, San Francisco, argued: “Please assured SAFE vaccine matters — disease spreading.”

The risks vaccinated people still zero, almost nothing real world zero risk. tiny percentage people may allergic reactions. I’ll eager see studies post-vaccination spread eventually show. evidence far suggests vaccines akin cure.

Offit told greeting enthusiasm greeted polio vaccine: “It rallying cry.”

The costs negativity
Why many experts conveying negative message?

Again, motivations mostly good. academic researchers, instinctively cautious, prone emphasizing uncertainty. Many may also nervous vaccinated people stop wearing masks social distancing, turn could cause unvaccinated people stop well. happens, deaths would soar even higher.

But best way persuade people behave safely usually involves telling truth. “Not completely open want achieve sort behavioral public health goal — people see eventually,” Richterman said. current approach also feeds anti-vaccine skepticism conspiracy theories.

After asking Richterman others better public message might sound like, left thinking something like this:

We immediately aggressive mask-wearing social distancing new virus variants. vaccinate people rapidly possible — require approving Covid vaccines data justifies it.

People received vaccine shots, waited take effect, able things unvaccinated people cannot — like meals together hugging grandchildren. pandemic defeated, Americans wear masks public, help unvaccinated people stay safe contribute shared national project saving every possible life.

they literally cannot wrap head around it, personal experience it. Well also depends state in. Democrats Republicans within state generally united workers rights, whether better worse. There's least 11 States require paid sick leave even smaller localities laws it. also heavily dependent industry, size organization, employer.

There's also Senators Representatives national level work tirelessly get cooperation things going, slow process tends get interrupted by, ""more pressing matters.""

Wealthy countries already committed that, ***after*** people get taken care first. stay daily discussion thread lol never said goal needed 100%. Thoseb refusing due misinformed going help situation though.  Yeah since kids can’t get vaccine high infection rates among lot unnecessary hospitalizations even deaths. Same, got appointment state site late March. would gotten first shot tomorrow wasn’t cancelled. 🥲 said vaccines still effective reduced capacity mutations?

So may even need second vaccine cause many deaths elderly dominant covid mutation causes. this? literally said director best hospital india Sounds like definitely depends trial part of, Pfizer trial get paid $150 every office visit, pay missed work gas/travel expenses (I live fairly close one research facilities, actually able pocket that, rather need supplement lost wages)

It's severe enough hospitalized. 

Public health authorities really screwed saying dumb shit like kids immune, can't transmit virus months could keep schools open. keep screwing insisting schools safe way hell level uncontrolled infection country. Ah q crowd it’s ‘super obvius’ Well, really think would simple this? There's experts advising every contentious thing since first outbreak.

If we're good one thing, widespread disagreement. 1st year, get one week. 5 years, get 2 weeks, 10 years, 3 weeks, 20 years 4 weeks something like that.

This -- contract USA -- think Europe either socialist humanist.

In European countries minimum vacation time starts 20 days year, usually around 25 average age person 30-35 French. WTF 33% nursing home employees opted in? Pure selfishness. endangering residents supposed care 😡  wearing mask social distancing help reduce obesity smoking rates? portal hospital system randomly let make appt vaccine, im eligible gave option. booked figuring worth shot(pun intended) worst thing they'll turn away. went there, questions asked got first dose pfizer... make bad person? lol Yeah, I'd say go motions vaccinated yet. reports Israel first dose Pfizer vaccine strong initially predicted, everyone's safety would still self isolate.

It's shame study transmission well, know much pressure whole world would meant faster reopening us all. study sucks. understand correctly. 
They tested 10,427 people covid antibodies. 10,000 found 1,058 antibodies. later date checked antibody levels 346 people. later 35 people. 
Of 35 people, ones higher antibody levels either smoker, type blood vegetarian. 

I’m gonna need 35 people trust study. way, making point person. young people uncertain vaccine rushed extent pandemic repeatedly told ""but still get sick spread it"", ones want save Iives might also thinking own. Now, particularly agree that, logic sound. could also argued person want get vaccinated feel like might slip get comfortable even KNOWING they're infected. young person might say, ""hey, still get it, even know probably less likely get tested may inadvertantly pass on.""

The messaging inarguably terrible far. OMG comments crazy!! average american do? asshat commenters make bad problem worse..x10 Young people can’t get major infections didn’t know?  TDR favors either vaccine becomes readily available everyone, could care less gets doesn't. feel criticism, heavily really do, judt say mean itll pass. question ask , 1 million doses, country vaccinated 50% population, sell vaccinate young adults, or, sell another country vaccinated anyone yet, willing pay .

I get comments one-sided, everyone wants jab end thing, everyone get eventually, example, Africa 74 million people 65 older, getting vaccinated would go long way without disturbing vaccination much. wear mask go out, avoid going need to, maintain distance wherever possible....

You know, ask things recommended year important bother with. many times wanted wear mask socially unacceptable.

Remember even though comment upvoted, outlier. People sub tend far paranoid sensationalist normal people.

Masks become commonplace western society, period. second mandates go away, mine going garbage. Ok well glaze extra limb people growing foreheads vaccine 😁 VS ending nowhere. isn’t uncommon, way back last year antibodies generally last 4-6 months. friend lost antibodies 6 months got Northeast got hit early know treat well. headline feel like anecdotal cases don’t actually change stats meaningful way. talking deaths half million territory, instances don’t exactly skew numbers. Nano tech destroyed chewing. read people take day two vaccinated. common, sometimes side effects exhaust person bit unable work well.

So would vaccinating workers also get 2 days off? Yes sadly I've seeing many people using Norway example vaccine dangerous. shame already several standard oral vaccinations. Polio rotavirus among them.  let cashiers sit worth least 0.50/hr pay - it’s insane seen huge positive obvs STANDARD. Gekoloniseerd, anybody? biggest fuckup buying 80 million Moderna doses. ordered another 80 delivery Q4... still use apple sauce horse pills give surgery... Keep convincing lies, that's fine. Go walk COVID ward think theater. Sounds risky unless New Zealand. Certainly government recommending. Everyone needs stay home, stay safe, stay alive vaccine fully distributed area, pay employees well, treat well, good quality groceries, affordable prices, etc.

Aldi's America needs. Walmarts pinching employee pennies destroying local businesses. Yeah, guess that’s Reddit posting links discussion. contribution literal text articles.

r/wallstreet bets even read calling clear trend. realistic.

Until everyone population opportunity vaccinated, including kids, masks social distancing going need continue.

What unrealistic expect believe everyone going return normal within months; person's social responsibility ends 10 days second vaccination dose. going happen.

Masks social distancing going continue least end year.  second shot, started develop direct mental link bill gates.  can't reported simultaneously? Viruses almost always evolve contagious less deadly could evade antibodies   start now, happening reality think reason vaccinating essential personal first would went back lock down, stricter lock reasonable proportion still vital activities society would protected hopefully transmit virus. That’s company. Trader Joe’s Aldi north outside Europe. isn’t Europe solving issues. It’s global leadership.

It’s obvious want American President involved. Yeah, think real issue. article focused temporary issue, vaccine 50% effective 2 weeks first shot 95% effective 2 weeks 2nd. Ie, putting high risk suddenly go maskless hang crowded spots maskless people immediate first shot. 

The real reason expect take many months longer mask requirements, restricted capacity, expected keep distance, etc. easy anti-mitigation people lie claim vaccine, putting others risk. Ish.

Great friend works children’s hospital city live says there’s never covid kids hospitalized. Guess we're going find out. also concerns too. trying hopeful terrible times like new horror book series, every media outlet trying outdo hyping random ""variant"" country. yep, 1301 cases 38 deaths America. Worth remembering, National Health Commission history corruption. E.g. retired official worked China’s National Health Family Planning Commission investigation alleged corruption, according media report. Thanks sharing experience! sort comments best top shows nightmarish experiences. kind comments need represented top well! No, young patients overwhelming health systems. approach laid precisely UK doing, example. hearing young patients overwhelming care systems across country, it’s rare so. Expecting school stay virtual unrealistic too...

Also... expecting cases drop 0 unrealistic well. deaths drop done that’s really think /shrug flu flu vaccine. several studies found asymptomatics driving spread- presymptomatics can. even said it. 

I’m sure you’re using stats article way are. Yes, 15 40% 39, really seem picking stats article without looking whole context said. Among negative baseline without symptoms, 39 (0.3%) placebo group 15 (0.1%) mRNA-1273 group nasopharyngeal swabs positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR week 4. data suggest even one dose, vaccine protective effect preventing asymptomatic infection. 

Why turn .1% negative news?

This vaccinated people- 10s 1,000s study, .1% found Positive PCR- whole different question whether PCR tests even meant diagnose. Could spread infection? much COVID live virus dead (PCR pick dead)? statements state could infect even positive test. 

And hate whole appeal authority thing, I’m going trust Harvard MD Infectious Disease Specialist says it’s unlikely, news media even Reddit. though. entirety population either willingly won’t cases can’t take vaccine. don’t even one approved kids yet. 

It’s realistic. vaccinated 25% population, gotten 1 shot. Obviously that's going incredibly visible effect cases. hopefully impacting coming weeks deaths vulnerable people getting vaccinated first. Gosh that’s BS ask me.

There patients people vulnerable charge. Simply irresponsible.

Maybe point ought find new job would like continue unnecessarily endangering people.

I'm participant, curious, got antibody test, results confirmed unblinded me. get right antibody test, absolutely done. concern lies fact might steadfast belief antibody resistance; there's always possibility antibody resistance may waned enough possibly contract COVID again.

With potentially 30% Americans covid plus vaccination vulnerable segments population well underway I’d flabbergasted weren’t *mostly* back normal April.

By mean normal life +masks -concerts music festivals. It’s free marketing way cheaper advertising 


There aren’t enough shots everyone anyway. Many employees won’t get paid time bonus, even clamoring shot.  learn something new every day Woopdeedoo think I'm *solely* framing issue that. take exception suggestion poor countries access vaccines simply corporate greed specter colonialism. recognize there's factors play keep poor countries poor. change fact find WHO's paid scold chastising wealthy countries vaccinating middle-aged doctors elderly villagers remotest Bangladesh gotten sub-zero mRNA vaccines yet disingenuous completely unsurprising. Negative 21 downvotes. Serves right. getting shots important. want solid, long lasting immunity, need booster shot. Wasn’t 18 months always optimistic timeline? That’s September. Seems like could track best case scenario (safe) thing without vaccination. Herd immunity vaccination actual goal CDC first dose vaccine data since Friday. clue numbers could be? 😂😂😂 Seriously EU?

What last thirteen months makes think (the US) one take global leadership this? 50% covid related death Norway occur long term care facilities 95% death 70+ population. groups ones filling hospitals causing restrictions Norway. would make absolutely sense start vaccination program groups. Countless studies showcased Brand X good name brand products

These studies flawed and/or incomplete.

When Walmart tells company carry product manufacture 3 cents cheaper already margins razor-thin, 3 cents come from?

Well, cheaper ingredients. tomatoes same, wheat same, etc. grow season's crops, turns really great, so-so, sludge barely sellable.

And essentially auctioned off, though participants think auction.

So trying make deficit 3 cents per unit, maybe buy sludge stuff. definitely buy great stuff.

And heads Walmart, maybe even put different SKU keeping labeling.

Maybe, long ago, generic good name brand. times changed. tell orgy!

I'm starting lose hope honest. Cases apparently dropping much southeast. Wonder was? Someone needs thorough investigation, must something different .. dare lie Unless new strain different enough make current vaccines useless comes nowhere, governors won’t political capital necessary another lockdown ensure mostly complied with.

The governors practical public opinion deciding measures would effective measures would waste political capital, since nobody would listen there’s way enforce it. Also, I'm still confused things. worried airborne droplet spread? know several people got infected even wearing mask office building. crazy virus spread, feel like airborne mainly. Even wearing n95 mask feel unprotected.

2. say 2 new variants 50x + contagious. How? contagious? mean handwashing masks less effective? mean spreads stays air longer?
.
3. vaccine prevent getting covid, spreading it? covid, spread it?

I know, really understand viruses stuff all. genuine questions, trying conspiracy nut. Variety overrated, Aldi (at least Germany) often repackages brand items budget versions. difference, get pick choice one quality decent.

Id rather endless isles mediocre cornflakes different face front. Wait, American cashiers stand? Why? use won’t even get opportunity take vaccine months years, don’t get bonus?

Give sources give break two weeks now. likely spike Michigan started poorer areas. know cheaper real estate/rent get started ""no frills"" (no bags, shopping cart 25c deposit, baggers, reduced payment options, etc).

Nobody anywhere knew vaccines would work.

What UK assume might one worked, ordered shedloads different types, even six seven work, enough vaccinate entire population.

So British govt ordered total 357 million doses vaccines 7 different developers. UK population 65 million.

So US company beat Aldi it. sure Aldi lead article. Timing? Yes. Also get bill already  ""A lot people saying US deaths World War Two really big deal! mean lot. top people saying that. That's hear.""

Donald J. Trump (Almost certainly.) suspect lot people subreddit, it’s knock - reclusive many years. finally feel though way life valid don’t want everyone go back way things were. That’s them. Doesn’t reflect real world. morning NPR mentioned went 300,000 deaths nationwide almost 400,000 deaths roughly one month. insane past several weeks been. feel optimistic, two vaccines approved come. they’re effective accounts preventing severe disease, indications may prevent transmission.

But cases fallen there’s still plenty time come back force vaccines widely distributed enough make difference.

It’s likely even everything goes plan we’re looking 100k deaths US many globally. friend full shit literally letting happen since think benefits them. get vaccine unless give money, make world better place others unless becomes better you. 

Remember polio blankets back know airborne. biological warfare side.  That’s great....if vaccines give  Actually no, definitely makes people attractive ""hard wired"" level.

Either way, would hospital send home saying serious lung infection? Tragic young. whole response pandemic infurating. seconded reason question? Genuinely curious one? Source? seems plausible. Yes, UK hasn’t vaccinated significant amount people risk yet. coming months see watch deaths drop substantially normal life returns. collecting news articles it?

Good luck you, thanks part making happen. virus China. make logic limit / ban travel February / March from, say, Romania Argentina Tanzania. far I’m concerned, they’ve BEST strawberry preserve. PERIOD. took roughly 10 months state reach 1 million confirmed cases, happened mid-November. California went hit 2 million cumulative infections shortly Christmas.  four weeks later, state added another million cases total. state top 10 deaths literally zero covid deaths 21 tells need know , anyone recall post came 4chan last year virus predicted severe Italy reached Brazil going bad indeed? prevalent teenagers. part US doesn’t Trader Joe’s I’ve always assumed little upscale grocery stores. really marketing thing? MIS-C prevalent teenagers. 14% cases occur 15-20 year old group. rest younger. average age 8. Incentives get vaccinated? Yeah weird all... mask really impact life much? Based flair you’re medic... much setting good example lol. results Moderna, Pfizer Oxford, one trial participant got vaccines (Pfizer) ended severe disease really technicality blood oxygen level briefly dipped 93%. hospitalisation needed. therefore thought efficacy severe infections higher headline efficacy figures, symptoms. media, seems like UK hospitals still overwhelmed even though folks still fairly tight lockdown (for example, first relevant articles popped Googled). course, would great hospitals stop overwhelmed based vaccinations only, even end social distancing restrictions, moment I'm seeing evidence UK accomplished that.

I mentioned ""essentially zero""; literal zero, small number cases population. Florida Texas still better many smaller states. ""more people makes harder"".

Hell, Texas given vaccinations California despite 2/3rds population.

Texas also, what, 11th? 12th? terms vaccinations per capita. 

You're right early days, let's pretend California stumbled right starting block. race begun there's time catch admitting mistakes first step correcting them. Yes, overall, young population. still high vaccination rates among 60+. Yeah bunch people said Covid would disappear November 5 political fabrication. think that's really case. Arent people poor? grocery shopping there, go normal grocery store fill anything need meals find there.

It's 1 specific thing need get there, save literally hundreds month, quality everything really high (especially compared cheap generics.) normally spend ~150-200 week groceries. Aldi knocks 100. fill cart brim shit thinking ""damn gonna expensive trip"" cashier like ""that's $76.32.""

Also things cut operating costs actually really nice me. Like baggers (or bags, bring own) means get people checkout like 20 seconds instead 5 minutes. 20 brands every item one sitting examining ingredients prices blocking way, everyone sorta power shops. Ends way faster trip normal grocery store. I'm sure sarcasm getting bit late night, already oral vaccine Polio researched Sabin. think many people getting vaccinated different times, CDC doesn’t wanna like “yeah take mask second you’re vaccinated!” make joke too. guess thing original thought. also need use terms industry paid people use. ""anti-union"" ""fired anytime"" states need frame issue. up, constant? No, can't. can't prove either. 

Would say COVID-19 like common cold like SARS? Source point? true. Exactly. I’ve seen fair quota “rage quit” people hired spot 30 min interview. labour freedom goes ways come cost, ya know?!? people realize professor get then? I’ll gladly take stead. I’m already seeing resurgence “lOnG tErM eFfEcTs MiLd cAsEs!!!” keep young people line. Long term effects happen, sure, they’re common enough warrant losing another year over. Enough enough right. vaccine, job, simple. Thats true. engineer exempt categorized correctly, would get paid working OT middle night.

But flip side, employment agreement probably stipulates working hours 8-5 such. woudlnt get paid also couldnt forced to. again, you’re free that. I’m going to. Hell, roughly half state (SC) gives maybe handful fucks is. 0 fucks given vaccine readily available general population. Guarantee late spring I’ll house parties, going bars, going sporting events, etc. choose live inside rest life means it, you’re gonna stop rest us. work department that’s part nursing home. It’s good job overall, pays well, hours flexible gives good experience. Unfortunately like nursing homes United States, hit hard covid (2-3-3/4 facility 120 residents + staff positive) one first state get vaccination (first dose January 3rd.)

As autoimmune disorders, I’m 100% sure true, guess that’s something watch for. It’s fair comparison, either way, since New York, etc. also degree natural immunity second waves hit.

There’s completely fair comparison. know South Dakota basically little mitigate Covid society actually collapse like many predicted. I’m sure people died would’ve stringent lockdown measures, that’s trade off. Whether benefits lockdown worth cost subjective moral absolute. tend mind lockdowns point aren’t worth it, though that’s personal opinion (though March/April virus new, unknowns, less prepared, would’ve favor lockdowns). Even Chicago, there's pretty big difference Aldi rich areas poorer areas city. unpopular message agree you.

The risk virus heavily focused people nursing homes elderly pre-existing conditions. never set foot nursing home within 100 feet anyone 65+ months, maybe twice grocery store.

As healthy person 55 personally little risk supposed lock restrict behavior behalf people might get sick. get society pull together etc. way contribute problem inadvertently become link transmission chain someone someone risk. Yes, happen, extremely unlikely.

Meanwhile people risk 1000 times careful including people take care nursing homes such. 90% risk concentrated 15% people people protected. Instead guidelines given everyone equally. Aldi great. give cashiers chairs sit in. wanted add brings total 17 FL counties offering vaccines Publix pharmacies. average age death covid UK 82. It’s remotely comparable. asking prove something one point.

And asking people halt entire lives based proof admitted have. *looks around*

Not sure fuck live, EVERYONE near (DFW, fucking huge dense place) back work, back school, going stores, going vacation, acting like everything okay.

That process certainly start without vaccine. fucking dumb? vaccine help, yes, certainly panacea. Holy fuck Sounds right. Promising preliminary results Pfizer Moderna vaccines already available Commission negotiating purchases. Like others stated, know vaccinated, may engage risky behavior. trial know got covid shot meningitis vaccine know, may cautious. could explain dip trial reality. would tell you’re severely disappointed her, tbh. There’s zero excuse anti-science healthcare worker.  let cashiers sit last shift.  “This New Zealand Variant cures cancer!”

The way New Zealand would happen guess ""distributed"" ""received"", maybe transit somehow

Correct. ""Doses distributed"" reported CDC shipped may still transit. guy master screwing COVID responses media eat hand 

He’s probably writing book leadership vaccine distribution speak 

Average past two weeks mostly flat decreasing slightly.  It’s Reddit thing ever post link say one understands get upvoted like crazy link clearly explains point made wrong. clicked links expecting see something Aldi Nord comparison, instead Trader Joe's I'm already familiar American, lol. Aldi Nord like? Yep also Bynum year well? It’s nothing. Schools open indoor mega concerts. ready start relaxing restrictions indoor dining (50% capacity first maybe) eventually eliminating allowing pure bars open. 

But ultimately think it’s futile bit silly start talking relaxing restrictions 3-4k deaths day. Let’s see progress react accordingly. settled? Supreme court ruled similar cases judged store managers exempt.

The restaurant industry also unique beast compared retailers. Meh, they’re ~150 miles away. never really made friends current local due nature work (partner works home, work two people, bit dads age), it’s logistically difficult. Maybe go camping spring, although partner isn’t hiking shape anymore kind sucks, since I’m sit around camp type. Since post deleted fact based information you:

Like not, continue need restrictions like masks social distancing, even receiving vaccine.   really makes basically sense ban travel foreigners absolutely nothing stop transmission Americans abroad.

And I'm arguing travel stopped everywhere Early February. situation X level one country ban travel wait exceeds X level another country, obvious bias play. sensationalism.

Anyways, keeps claiming I've seen 5 countries developed vaccines exporting many much they're using themselves. **About 147,000 people vaccinated covid-19 Sweden, according Swedish Public Health Agency.**

*Published 13:52 (The text updated, case changes update translation too)*

About 147,000 people vaccinated covid-19 Sweden, according information regions reported Public Health Agency. Later Tuesday, figures per region published.

To date, nearly 90 million cases covid-19 detected around world. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell describes situation still serious.

\- slightly lower figures Christmas holidays, rise continues roughly line before. unfortunately probably diminishing effect pandemic far, says Tegnell.

In Sweden, ""cautious decline"", Tegnell emphasizes one careful drawing early conclusions. spread infection appears decreased younger age groups.

\- seem rise quickly also fall back fast pace, says Tegnell.

Since Friday, 9,770 new covid cases registered Sweden. total 533,265 people confirmed infected covid-19 country since start pandemic.

268 deaths registered since last Friday total 10,591 people died suites covid-19 country.

4,597 people confirmed covid-19 far cared ICU.

\- ICU bit behind development spread infection society, says Tegnell.

The state epidemiologist reports situation certain regions. Skåne region worst affected right terms spread infection Stockholm clearer decline since weeks ago.

The feared increase infection worried connection ski trips regions Jämtland-Härjedalen Dalarna seems absent.

\- look like extensive spread infection connection (skiing ed. Note).

To date, approximately 147,000 people vaccinated covid-19 Sweden, Tegnell emphasizes reporting various regions yet complete.

\- want continue emphasize important regions continue use doses get rapid protection, says Tegnell.

Taha Alexandersson, deputy head emergency preparedness National Board Health Welfare, says reduction number patients covid-19 need intensive care compared previous week.

She emphasizes healthcare affected southern parts country great variation country's regions regarding capacity intensive care.

\- need utilize capacity, says. Listen, I'm freaking twenty something make study vaccines living. 

I'm repeating government state said. 

I think know science done. thought lower viral load lower risk spread. people vaccinated better less. 

I eligible. 

I told take it. 

I did. family completely vaccinated soon, friends(healthcare workers). worries bringing Covid home longer play, longer wearing N95 public. shocking, surprising. updated data Johns Hopkins University, additional 1,400 coronavirus deaths nationwide Monday -- significantly lower figure month lowest daily toll since Jan. 3. CNN reported Tuesday researcher University Arizona says coronavirus variant identified Britain may actually circulated first United States. Masked residents seen Sunday waiting line outside Abyssinian Baptist Church New York City receive dose coronavirus vaccine. Dude broke quarantine such. WTF deadline? website looks 100% TV Film save one little article Covid. BioNtech's vaccine, Pfizer really helped manufacturing logistics clinical trails. stock shot super high approved.

I rode Moderna's wave everyone saying fraud. I'm pretty well now. Sucks suck. Yeah, sure reporters taking comments scientists context trying get clicks really helpful. variants single mutation spike protein really impact vaccine efficacy. one I'm aware could South African one several. Even highly unlikely would completely vaccine resistant. black hole may consume earth.

God stupid fear mongering headlines articles, I'm even going click article dont want clicks. live NY Cuomo done well times (April) poorly others (earlier March, vaccine rollout policies). He's probably gotten disproportionate national attention stuff he's done well. sent sick people back nursing homes refused send vaccines area follow exact plan vaccinating EMTs. F? want truly thank participated vaccine trials. real heroes along healthcare workers, never able repay done us. Sincerely, human race Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, get argument otherwise. Vaccines like, work, follow prescribed schedule. worst, get two shots later. People acting like getting second dose time means never get it. say natural immunity. believe vaccine [effective strains.  don’t think data transmission vaccination take long find. However, Israel, despite country vaccination rollouts, country infections per day, showing vaccine alone enough control spread disease. Another research showed first shot, people disappointing level body antidotes lower Pfiser reported, meaning one month lag time people get first shot actually vaccinated, might slow mutations becoming infective. place constantly telling us badly west handled covid well places like Africa handled it.

By sub's logic west needs vaccine most, why's selfish? good thing scientists found new strain since infection already researched (L452R). vaccines need updated... it. 

In current form, doubt variant big deal lacks N501Y mutation Brazilian, SA, UK strains have. L452R mutation thought behave similarly 484K mutation. Yeah wondering data. Like mean ""distributed"" exactly? Like physically state? Sent way point dispensing? like allocated/reserved?

It's logistical problem really hard. state could everyone tabulate doses report it. frustrating. actually blood test im clinical trial woth scanwell  Yeah, pointed elsewhere thread got bunch downvotes. check lot accounts, post right wing subs, yeah. thread seems *a lot* worse usual (there always right leaning people thread hardly dominant here) guess linked elsewhere target odd coincidence. 

For record, Cuomo fan voted primary challenger last election. record bit right leaning uncooperative NYC mayors, often attacking city blaming mayor stuff responsibility benefit upstate voters. lot NYC residents fans goes back covid mindless partisan opposition like people thread. ones kill cannot get due number medical issues.

Read 1918 pandemic. See went people denial. confused, mean? intelligently fine. one training partner one entire year obviously roll lockdowns occurred. point stop people dying. one cares another type cold running around. Also, notice, likely lot spread last quarter 2020 happened workplace schools. media ever mention work place people contracted COVID? I've seen ranking bottom five places, utter bullshit. longer spend around people breathing air indoors, likely contract one infected. majority infections happen right home. people spend significant chunk time, wonder??? yet narrative they're getting BBQ's, parties, hanging friends. possibly getting work, right? U.S. media (tv especially) epic failure comes virus spreads where. They're giving 4 hours paid time get vaccinated (more less). paying vaccines, they're paying get vaccinated. nuanced, two things different. far less worth depends local weather. Ontario even less worth mild winter been. Flu season = cold dry season. AZ always fuck attitude covid. never actually shut down, even “please stay home want k thanks” order Ducey far reaching “essential” positions basically everyone qualified essential nobody questioned it. Closest got actual shutdown curfew Fashion Square got trashed wasn’t even related covid enforced outside downtown. 

Hopefully stadium getting converted 24/7 vaccine site new one Gilbert help move things positive direction. department health booking site confusing hell, people getting vaccine Heard things Reuters governments debating whether allow vaccinated people free movements partake banned activities. Particularly EU what's holding us refusal agree use vaccine passes cards identify safe individuals, since equal would discriminate can't vaccinated.

So may consensus people nursing homes get vaccines demand start living normally again.  Fair follow-up wouldnt mean vaccines would go whole new trial delaying doses like half year? “fall ill”, mean allergic reaction. “some” mean six wearing seat belt became law people went apeshit. Cut cars, endangered lives loved ones make ridiculous point freedom.  It’s perfect data means, don’t need double blind clinical trial determine pattern lasting effects COVID 19. Science isn’t perfect, thinking need perfect conditions order study something helpful anyone. wouldn’t publish anything based unless verified elsewhere person looking good enough. show pattern, get idea effects common others, learn roughly long effects last. second

Hope mean 2 weeks get last shot. Give another month know. vaccine doesn’t work immediately people vaccinated 2-3 weeks ago could well exposed presenting infections. Well, no, also kind of.

The American supermarket chain Aldi owned German parent company Aldi Sued.

Trader Joe's parent company German Aldi Nord.

Aldi Nord Aldi Sued separate companies since 1960. Aldi Nord purchase Trader Joe's 1979.

So context Aldi refers American supermarket chain, Aldi Trader Joe's.   one first people state participate clinical trials. Since holidays every member family got sick, none severely thank god, person stayed healthy Yes, thanks check in, I'm work read post 15 consecutive minutes devote it. Use drugs West use Prophylaxis. seen kits given people take. West mostly relying vaccines. 

Plus high vitamin populance. They're going vaccinating? vaccinated? COVID-19 vaccines effective B.1.1.7, that’s point. infections mean hospitalizations higher mortality rates, puts strain already strained-to-the-hilt health care system.  Got 2nd shot yesterday.

Clinician said it’s ok take Advil even said it’s fine take before.

I took late last night started getting headache probably take today I’m feeling little run down. person speaking politely obvious poorer nations testing capabilities richer ones. make opposite claim requires proof.

The US, example, spent $25 billion testing, greater entire GDP nearly half countries world. workers working free. Lives stake many months regarding covid. apparently decided care. Well, least enough anything.  BS, wanted microchip local 5G tower could tase easier. Placebos unethical anyways, glad least get actual vaccine eventually. normal quarantine people exposed contagious dangerous diseases. know certain amount time passed, unlikely it'll fade away soon assholes like move less dangerous subject troll about? Perfect, thanks! see message yet? transmission yes even level deaths going acceptable soon

That's way becomes every virus. deaths transmission lessen flu 4x that, folks care much. Citations needed alarmed. sources talk resistant strains also highlight fact vaccines less efficient, completely useless.

As well this, mRNA vaccines altered combat new strains easily make whole new vaccine combat it. shelter place announced ny pause. extreme idea wasnt needed It’s due quantity. Imagine certain percent chance single virus mutating quite small. millions infections globally increases chance exponentially virus mutation ends beneficial (to virus). Damn got Funny controlled virus unlike US. agree it’s terrible many people completely overlook importance healthy, it’s insane empathy people literally dying, regardless feel lifestyle. live mom. state's dashboard am. generally notified shipments exact amounts shipments got thing annoys clear realization hang small groups unmasked everyone vaccinated group going completely radar. emphasis needs wearing mask public spaces vaccinated show least positives get TASS В Роспотребнадзоре заявили о 100%-ной иммунологической эффективности ""Эпиваккороны""  Rospotrebnadzor announced 100% immunological effectiveness Epivakkorona    Ah ok. Thank you. Smart idea. assume identified strain different markers first, otherwise massive oversight.

Thanks much insight. testing see strain patients infected severe cases, would possible tell infected either new variants Brazil? [I virologists concerned strain resistant antibodies people develop first infection. mention fact two dose regimens would need processes place track needs second dose when. J&amp;J vaccine would work best developing world. Pfizer Moderna never going countries better rich countries rely donate J&amp;J doses.  upset? Lol state live in?

This, anything. think TJ's breaking law, hire lawyer sue think especially egregious, call police. Harassing store employees get followers pathetic. Japan, bro, please Olympics go. 

I think feasibly happen year. Even force through, people stay away, people people generally try stay away Covid making country huge soup Covid.

Why plan next year try year failed last year?  Cuomo literally *denied* de Blasio's shelter-in-place (ie, lockdown) orders back New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said won’t approve “shelter-in-place” order New York City, day Mayor Bill de Blasio told residents prepare “That going happen, shelter place, New York City,” Cuomo said Daily podcast New York Times. “For city county take emergency action, state approve it. wouldn’t approve shelter Cuomo said drastic policies would create fear amid COVID-19 outbreak, infected 6,500 people across U.S. killed least 115, according Johns Hopkins University. US participating want expand hegemony vaccine policies, Trump wanted shift blame onto thus pulled everything involving WHO? Arabs less interested getting vaccinated, far anti vaxxers among them. 

Jews often go Arab towns get vaccinated vaccines thrown out, since getting equal amount doses, adjusted population. second Pfizer dose last week expect keep precautions public awhile population gets vaccinated I’m 100% okay that. 

But won’t lie pretend vaccine hasn’t already affected behavior, don’t mean I’m going parties/licking doorknobs etc. I’m much likely make unnecessary trip mall Target 3 months ago. Right wrong, think that’s mentality lot people have. 

The rest friends/family aren’t vaccinated yet haven’t seen anyone indoors, get vaccinated I’ll too. I'm sure mean, ""mink variant"" one know thought extinct, ones still flourishing, afaik.  Middle February beginning. Deaths would triple hit 2/1 got first dose last night. Arm feels like someone hit baseball bat. many people may gene vitamin deficiency genetics living different climate. Black people genes weren’t meant living places like Minnesota likely going vitamin deficient. think studies shown third US population vitamin deficient going way number people genes cause deficiency assume. would really able compare controls without gene? vaccine spurs creation antibodies?

I wish joking. end here, bye.  Well, we're 400k averaged 2850/day January things getting worse. would miracle hit 500k Feb, I'd say hit Feb 19th. consent form study protocol provided early November said may unblind participants, guarantee. Given want get pregnant, wanted sure would tell me. asked specifically situation pregnancy, study recruiter told uncertain terms no, tell would want keep updated outcomes pregnancy. hard pass me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It could also site specific Contract Research Organization specific (CRO; i.e., actually running study behalf company). Or, entirely possible that, given EUA Pfizer &amp; Moderna, consent/protocol AZ trials changed since going enroll. time, study coordinator said would agree unblinded unless 2-year follow-up post-EUA AZ, company decided (so guarantee). also surprised since seems like, ethically, company would provide vaccine placebo group if/when gets EUA. also entirely possible study coordinator/recruiter talked misinformed, since likely poorly paid recent college grad (speaking past personal experience). Wrong flair. East Asia SE Asia Good news decreasing majority states. re-vaccinate everybody new vaccine. Starting elderly healthcare workers general population again. would take time especially it’s two doses Vaccine takes 2 weeks kick in. one takes two shots. might take another week booster effect kick in. So, 3 week delay.

If people act like virus exist because, ""Vaccine,"" could explain higher numbers.

Worse case scenario creating hotbed canvas virus mutate vaccine. Lowering efficacy, long term. keep inventory transporting, preparing shipment, shift changing multiple use-cases. done manually.  also received second dose. never stop going gym pandemic, I'm even less worried before. 

The gym absolutely done safely proper procedures. Strict cleaning before/after using machine, closing equipment achieve social distancing, limiting number occupants, mandatory mask wearing, moving outside, etc. flu +_+

Just kidding. Stay well. Nope. way round. South cigarettes. split happened 1961. sell cigarettes since 70s think.

South considered ""premium"" Aldi here. current status quo China outsized power buy coerce votes small developing countries debt colonialism aka ""belt road"". probably much would change balance power. Also thing worse tyranny majority tyranny minority. Fauci known giving conservative estimates. disagree prediction? countries, especially so-called superior universal healthcare, really fairing better? Going deaths per million, US top ten behind nine European countries. twenty countries, excluding micronations, 1,000 deaths per million, sixteen European countries. WHO: Go fuck self Yes does, far superior Aldi. Although I'll happily shop Aldi store Lidl available, they're fantastic. Lidl fantastic. enough, partially obesity epidemic hugely benefits certain sectors economy, serious attempt get people eat less/less junk would harm companies lobby government.

There's also separate intertwined issue makes complicated, massive mental health crisis too, body image big part that, even exclusively overweight people (think people suffering anorexia example). got able balance public messaging discourages unhealthy weight drive bunch people, obese non-obese alike, hate fall depressive spirals.

Ultimately, straightforward solution first thing mentioned, limiting/regulating junk food manufactures purposely flood world addictive cheap snacks. solve problem would dent significant public cost. hard pull money involved Guess we’ll see goes? hope long term damage kids. I've noticed small county %s seemed hit peak, everyone would died ... already did. Lol aged like milk. tell exactly vaccine would speed ECONOMIC recovery

Well considering live country still lockdown may different perspective. America country world get families' jobs back. Tell get friend's house back. Tell get uncle back.

Jesus. Beg sympathy someone else way, I'm computer, can't see stupid fucking emojies.

Calm dude, fucking hell. worked this? said vaccine would help. Take deep breath maybe step away computer awhile relax. ever wanna read fun story, read Walmart trying enter German market. tried anti-workers' rights shtick well fell flat faces. even 10 years leave country losing lot money.  Well that's good. white people get already something?  stupid. scenario US would get Pfizer vaccine. Don’t listen people saying purely transmissible variant. plays part don’t think it’s everything. UKs cases gone back last weeks similar measures previous lockdown. nature variant effect similar measures working not. 

Instead think you’d better served understand virus hits one person, disseminates, dissipates periods time. cycle driven complicated forces that, short convincing people everything safely nothing all, don’t think could point one thing useful way stop it. 

Masks one way something safely, don’t account myriad ways virus spreads. Wearing masks isn’t everything safely. long shot. masks maybe stop individual spread less helpful ensuring dissipates. Lockdowns like UK one blunt instrument ensures everyone nothing instead trying make sure people everything safely. Pathetic groveling. Can't believe come this. well means whats point taking leadership one really say good position hear recall vote governor. must one worst time periods politician would someone earning well concerned holidays? minimum entitlement 5.6 weeks/year UK. people still insist American news publications reliable despite intentionally misleading coverage story. We're new era yellow press. applauding corporations government should. Since virus disproportionately affects older people, older people get vaccines younger people unless doses expire used immediately, period end story. happens vaccinated people asymptomatically spread virus? happens can't find develop vaccine ""cleanses"" COVID-19? 

Do wear masks lockdown rest time human civilization exists? we, like past pathogens, go back normal accepting people die it. Like case TB, seasonal influenza, chickenpox, etc. you, second mask mandates dropped, I’m throwing mine giant bonfire. Amen People 55 magically immune it. Many still die many, many develop long term health issues it. T

The death rate low enough it’s risk worth taking. plan never sit home 3 years. Damn fr 

I caught flu earlier Dec Where? thought salary American dream got started working 80 hours week. making money hourly overtime Next year split anymore, Aldi's going fuse back together. second reunification Germany needs Good info.

Up North Dakota, governor ended state mask mandate, think every city(all 3 them) city mandate. forcing, except instead guns steel throwing around money politicians. 
Having lived travelled back visit, Chinese influence stark! think i'll ever go back never wearing masks. Living NYC, taking subway time, get 4 BAD fevered colds per winter. Minimum. 

I sick year. I'll keep masks i'm tight public places, along antibacterial gel, seems small thing stay healthy. said would happen inauguration. Sucks right. still unfair argument say young people overwhelming hospitals today UK, therefore would overwhelm system social distancing masking removed equation. Even though deaths may go due younger adults lower risk death, cases may go unvaccinated younger folks give social distancing. According CDC, [up young adults would require hospitalization. point deaths metric looking at.

Again, society might agree, lot society trouble looking bigger picture. certainly hope vaccinations healthcare workers older adults would enough knock spread enough reduce hospitalizations, moment seen happen seen modeling predicting it. True. irony Aldi German company. Rome... I’m going go well placed source Twitter post. agree, issue vaccine hesitancy among African American community rightly bit skeptical Tuskegee major problem. African American community country CRUSHED pandemic, many community still vulnerable vaccine skeptical.

If time comes get vaccinated they’re still saying no, that’s huge group vulnerable country desperately need safety vaccine scared. Vaccinating NBA help fight vaccine hesitancy.

The question is, one individuals answer, giving let’s say 5k vaccines inspire millions vaccine skeptical individuals get vaccinated worth jumping 5k line? applied Aldi. didn’t want guys think anyone wants (excluding minors) able vaccinated? know Fauci saying April seems overly optimistic me. Thanks! mean, entire industries shut food bank lines miles long. I'm fairly sure able find someone looking job. No. jobs US, yes, take sick days time even sick, risk fired get caught often.

Many employers US afraid breaking (strict, complicated) rules regarding personal health information, ask medical information call sicj. also easy fire people without repercussions. quite employers made sign paperwork right ask doctor's notes called sick, even three weeks surgery HR person declined take copy doctor's note offered them.

I salary jobs USA sick time limited, employer would find reasons fire staff suspected abusing system using ill. done even direct supervisor happy employee believe anything wrong, employee getting work done home simply staying office due illness.

My current job state government, state's employees get 2 hours sick added personal bank leave per week. call sick, uses hours sick leave equal many scheduled work. sick leave used negative three times, fired. supposed chronic illness need surgery etc anticipate run sick leave request long term leave (which allows use vacation time sick leave runs out) request unpaid leave, always approved legitimate illnesses. Bots never good humans. interpret said. bought mom cutting knife set Christmas. think didn’t think Crofton good cut &amp; cut frozen jowl meat they’re like, great knives! show us wait patiently, keeping social distance protocols example? would good PSA. think want free go party. Except that’s scientists speak. “Suggests” means “we’ve found decent evidence support this” “ehh think” I’ve doing. parents watching entertainment news last night made seem like plague coming reaffirm numbers actually looking good variants aren’t much concern. Lol Well, kinda duty governments assure health people first. 

Let's assume government country vaccinates old people helps get vaccine countries. 

That might ethical thing people wont forget next government likely ultra-right, probably antisemitic racist one that's government something like again. Okay, send crap publix let handle it, again, take month start, get going !! know long term effects covid theres chance shaving years otherwise healthy 30 year old would gained giving nursing-home bound 80 year old.

We aim reducing infections bring deaths. Otherwise gaming stats tricking others false sense security, giving virus chances mutate. can't wear mask cold?

Who told can’t? You’re making scenarios feel oppressed. Honest question - trust numbers Florida? arrest someone willing fudge numbers? February? Sooo 100,000 deaths next two weeks? 

Yeah no. Let's spread unnecessary fear here. enough legitimate panic going around is. That's normal Aldi. way ensure people return carts, means pay somebody pick carts parking lots, results lower prices. founders Aldi real penny-pinchers. Huh. TIL Global leadership country without universal healthcare, paying part salaries unemployed, protecting small businesses? Entitled yes. get probably not. think Aldi Nord Süd very, similar selection (in Germany is), fact think products identical. still pretty basic, things like goat cheese salmon considered essentials, guess (just expect variety brands choose from) That's natural, no. especially culture eye contact crucial. Every key facial expression seen around eyes.

Sunglasses much suspicious, annoying I'm talking someone. made logical thoughtful points--you simply wrote figures expected make horseshit associations head put together string fucking thumbtacks.

I agree lot people dying. many. Trump/Republican administration made mockery country made mockery people supported country. fucking travesty.

Yes, vaccine slow deaths. Please, tell exactly vaccine speed ECONOMIC recovery can't even deliver fucking vials vaccine time. Tell get families' jobs back. Tell get friend's house back. Tell get uncle back.

Play play. Tell me. Please. would magically recover economy?

Olympics postponed next year (which hope case), dates overlap World's Cup? would interesting handle it, probably many people attend would attending one (and that's ignoring covid economy, going lower numbers attendance), guess that's Japan keeps pushing Olympics year. Best reaction troll statement. Cudos. Well thats issue rules. They're generally enforced ones make them, spirit sorta get lost transit. fair people waiting story like come out... matter would happened Pfizer never keen taking data interpretation bank, period. Aldi really split us Aldi Nord Aldi south? Lmao Gov. Cuomo upset Trump. news, Earth round. going catch every case testing. Actual infections 3x 5x official tallies estimates posted sub. 

For example, personally know several families everyone got sick time one person got tested (and came back positive). meant tax breaks state intervention like communism intervenes economy. go. Either lower taxes high, give part society break others carry burden later. Without universal healthcare, one reasons pandemic terrible. Yeah that's going happen. numbers get low enough people already vaccinated stop wearing masks grocery store unless super strictly enforced. inevitable, point forward people see others wearing mask stop themselves. Yes total bullshit fuckup delivered. EU loves throw money problems. one problem could solved throwing money it, getting greedy. politicans begging people stay home, harden restrictions wonder people comply anymore time can't get vaccinated almost vaccine.

This bad situation. can't say hey people need stay home dont vaccinate, vaccines way pandemic. really wonder long CA government going try keep everything locked even past vaccines rolled en masse. People FED here, especially dont live anywhere near SoCal. ""anti-vaxxer"" something rules completely arbitrary point obviously we've got worst numbers despite strictest rules. know people whose taste still pretty bad, different everyone going anything scientists incentive prove / disprove, percentage overly paranoid population continued harvested type media fear mongering. According Worldometer passed 400k Friday. never issue time, location Banner AZ? I'm aware that, store closes 8PM. empty time, that's go then. lose taste aswell week People always die. bizarre all. safest society least deaths would one travel home work via mass transportation, everything else remote, locked home otherwise. 

Do want society like that? culture, physical connections beyond maybe immediate family, travel, hobbies outside home. 

At point good many outweighs good 7,000,000,000 vs 500,000. may like it, cannot held hostage extremely small amount people problems create problems EVERYONE result trying save small minority. trade million vaccines healthcare system.   saying need photo shoot kim kardashian taking shot butt everyone get vaccinated?  bright side, least stupids proudly announcing themselves. yes one year!! 10 week! 15 deaths week vaccination mean literally Slave castles West Africa literally trade Europeans African chiefs.
You historically illiterate entire conversation proven Jails, refused let non violent offenders even though there's supposed bail requirements charges, prosecutors still asking it.

Boomers oppressing us far longer pandemic, doesn’t really matter. What’s another 6 months youth point older people sacrificed younger generations? probably bad idea although unfortunately could also motived cancel many games using cover Nah health insurers life policies quickly clauses covid.

Pfizer data controlled study. cannot compare results study giving vaccine people large. check swab every single person got jabbed rule prior infection? read Pfizer said 'after 12 days' make sure looking infections 12 days? actually PCR's every single vaccine participant see onset is, symptoms actual infection? behaviors people recently jabbed aligning behaviors individuals trial \*know\* 50-50 vaccine? discussing persons presenting \*any\* symptoms specifically persons presenting \*severe\* symptoms. 

It even apples oranges. Comparing blinded trial colloquial outcome at-large vaccination like comparing apples concept indemnity. See said makes sense? Exactly. 

I can't teach math hard enough job. try get next generation engineers think, however.

In limited social circle half people tested positive symptoms knew work required testing surgery get test. One family member 5 contracted - household- never developed symptoms tested positive. It’s common. They're Southern Hemisphere?  evidence completely touch average person economics works.  work meatpacking plant, employer gave us notice we're 1B iirc, us want vaccine opportunity get around beginning February  like Canada, giving vaccines another country **not** placing needs citizens? know elderly people grew world war II. blackouts, ration stamps, draft fathers overseas etc. helped seems inspiring leader feeling we're together we're going make work. Biden need come something along lines. problem putting proper face enemy ( virus ). seem recall reading somewhere President Roosevelt something, maybe subsidized, inspiring patriotic music, know that's true. read somewhere 300,000 WW II vets alive US. Maybe around time commemorating 75th anniversary Japanese surrender? many plans Hawaii got cancelled. Apologies, mentioned another person - worded poorly. I'm low risk catching COVID flu, I'm low risk category (statistically speaking). agree more. understand argument need wear masks grocery stories public places little longer wait everyone get vaccinated. social settings like resteraunts bars, house parties wearing mask fine 17-21 days. I’m getting 2nd next week day 17. big ask. 2nd dosers i'd inclined help fewer get wasted long run Congrats! know three people it. One still feeling horribly two weeks later going onto week three. two others can't even get coming onto second week. Everyone willfully ignoring CDC hypothesized Friday. Hospitalizations continue fall go back previous levels March-May new variant. Hope wrong cautiously optimistic. Ha. Haha. Hahahahahahahaha. 

No hourly employees don’t get paid go medical appointments Lol right. I’m taking soon can. got life live. Don’t care that’s selfish Wth about? never implied said anything stating. Go reply someone else. Spooky vaccine! saw deleted comment.

You're right though, need vaccine ""my odds dying trivially low?"" line thinking, bother wearing mask chances dying trivially low? bother refraining going out? bother seeing friends? I've best stay always wearing mask absolutely go out, making really good point here... city 2 aldis built maybe 5-8 years ago. wouldn’t say people shop it’s poor mans store. personally don’t like store. selection small it’s weird brand stuff. thing. haven’t overlooked anything Imo.  Gottlieb vested financial interest Pfizer. That’s fact. went FDA straight board directors.  resume publicly available. I’ve heard podcast. I’ve heard Sirius radio. He’s indirectly selling Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA months.  blames distribution issues foreseen, governmental inefficiency standard ages, shifted tone subtly say “sell! It’s fault”. ? Imo it’s he’s going held accountable hedge fund managers lose massive amounts positions took premised information. 

And right. I’m assuming Johnson &amp; Johnson Oxford /az COVID-19 vaccines safer unlike Moderna Pfizer, publicized detailed data. tested every subject weekly regardless whether reports symptoms. types vaccines developing proven. aren’t experimental. aren’t like Moderna prior Covid ZERO products market. Literally single vaccine ever passed trials despite ample funding, valuations billions decade time. 

Ftr - I’m investing pharmaceuticals. I’m investing health life. isn’t money me. It’s vaccine creating neutralizing antibodies measured high 588 day 59! second J&amp;J dose, doubled tripled amount ! That’s goal. think “long hard” that. risks unproven mRNA vaccines unsubstantiated evidence efficacy. agree you, playful mood trying joke.  Go eeoc equal employment opportunity commission It’s like r/apple shitting apple. fans hate :) completely false. wrong people? look long term data SARS. 


You better hope don’t get long COVID. Then, you’ll understand wrong were. then, stop part problem listen scientists.  🤪🤪🤪 got twice? First responders get exposed orders magnitude times higher viral load risk complications.  crazy thing still asking us jobs risk infection many retirees. yes, say boomers control policy messaging America exceptions. 

My proposal would program vaccinates healthcare workers, grocery store essential workers. that, first come first serve. Anyone retired unemployed 65, would use state resources deliver groceries quarantine. dad &amp; stepmom live Southwest Florida. friends work hospitals medical facilities around state. They’ve said volumes normal levels time year. aren’t kinds doctors could sitting around beer 7pm things crisis levels hospitals. It’s happening. month gotta move past front lines dont want it. big true Yea I'm afraid I'll die I'm scared long term health effects. People know want get vaccine think dangerous, plus would still wear mask think worth it. risk long-term health effects vaccine probably 100x even 1000x lower chances suffering long term health effects virus. Yet everyone thinks I'm crazy wanting vaccine.... luck we'll able hold B117 variant bay continued vaccine rollout last major wave. Agreed. find interesting thing schools then, thing aren’t closing schools. right basically. schools area open case gone full remote learning. luckily option full remote learning elementary schools full time, little accommodation virus. Yet people tell spreading lies fear here. Thats fair. Within immediate family coworkers would day 1/4 already covid. one third shot covid apparently difference vaccines deployed. Aldi Lidl area. love Aldi’s, lot cheap, healthy food often even beat Walmart’s prices. like bag cart policies well. Same, same. scary feel like I'm verge losing it. aren’t new strains around every “mutation” single strain dozens new headline, “new” strain LA discovered year ago. surveillance poor new strains developing today won’t seen become dominant I'll say think places eradicate matter hard tried, leave that.

Someday someone come eradication plan convinces even people like possible, though. different ballgame. actual quote? Lol

Post link so, I’ve gotta see it! US Aldi pay bad grocers employees tend better jobs. still think paid little intense job is. keep watching videos people refuse wear mask respond bullying threats violence. It’s like, dude, actual hell wrong you? ""Non obese people tend care health non obese people."" -Spidermen pointing meme players take it. needs *immediate* effort get vaccine ready kids. 

The idea right seems we'll send kids back school ""say fuck 'em, they'll get eventually we'll hope long-term impacts bad"". 

Fuck. That. Yet tons people saying extremely rare. people reinfected going around spreading lies fear. wrong people? get mad people take virus seriously. don’t doesn’t mean to. guess none type people COVID. us know seriously needs taken.  cops show up..... maskless Flu worse Covid. don’t mean way downplay Covid all. flu joke whatsoever 

My nursing school made go clinical rotation flu passed like 3 hours Were? actually study posted /r/covid19 basically concluded 90% immunity 7 months infection. People got second time tended less severe infection. neurocardiogenic syncope?  Kinda meant. said better lol one point says going ""Vaccine Vacations/Tourism"" lie like that? EXACTLY giving VACATIONERS NON FULL TIME residents ""essential workers"" G.O.S. changed spawn behavior. German here, yes. need doctor's note (most commonly third day absent), that's issue. Wait...what?
You can't get overtime paid salary?
What shitty country this? yeah say get ""bad colds"" like bedridden least 3 days... go keep wearing mask keeping hands clean? 

also... enough Vodka get stomach viruses /s mean yes no. quite level USA.

For USA like ""I've never heard poor man's brand sells cheap crap.""

In Germany? like REWE Aldi next door, consider Aldi cheaper, sensible option know want know get there, REWE one better assortment goods offer. Like want buy lightbulbs, COVID masks, shampoo food, I'm going REWE, want food I'm going Aldis.

I would use stores depending situation Germany, attitude American looking Walmart Aldi's, they'd shun Aldi's universally cause familiar brand. Aldi South known US Trader Joe’s, simply they’ve bought chain. It’s superior supermarket chain equal surpassing best supermarket chain Netherlands known Albert Heijn. company operates UK generic ALDI name. 
So yeah understand confusion. Aldi UK Aldi NL sound worlds apart. successful profitable way segment nevertheless, it’s confusing really. They've multiple lawsuits process changing management structure, getting overtime. Salaried exempt managers specific duties Aldi store managers fulfill, paid overtime. fight though, tell keep log hours possibly go money leaves. ya go. believe site goes live tomorrow Misinformation continue occur, well decades now. 

People know COVID deadly. And, people want harm us use means necessary fool lead us believing vaccinate. 

Anti-vax campaigns intended cause harm - and, successful. Look measles outbreaks we've prior COVID19. 40 year old locked bathroom cops show up. That’s definition mentally well dad 77. smoked 50 years quit 10 years ago. scares shit me. Yeah people downvote want, standard consideration deciding treatment offer people. number quality adjusted life years lost 20 year old dies like 20 times higher 85 year old dies. can’t count bodies call day. prices biggest thing quality big bonus. couple produce went bad quickly, probably stored right me, complaints. 

Back prices though. I've cut grocery bill roughly 400 month around 200 month. $50 usd goes long way Aldi's. 

I get excited Wednesday check online deals lol. need sacrifice thing right life health. Sounds like you’ve never Grocery Outlet. think hurt summer nobody wants outside long florida summer (spent summers there, pretty miserable). people inside AC. weather's better, easier outside there, (melbourne), mask wearing better expected, twice see someone store without one. Wtf hate coronavirus now? Unfortunately Astrazeneca made mess trials. can't blame one government. Yeah Fauci said one point humans would stop shaking hands forever. Okay well. super easy. know people hit hard. Lots debates fast reopen. activities allowed, masking still encouraged stating wane True! bonus benefit: masks strange scents Ok. How's related this? wife broke leg months ago. went urgent care, wore masks, hand sanitizer partitions set up, everyone saw us wore lots PPE.

Friends battery die car gave guy ride auto parts store, wore masks hug anything.  people know age (late 20s) show Aldi Trader Joe's. 95% grocery shopping Aldi love it. quality keeps improving prices remain unbeatable. see kinds people compared 10 years ago. No, didn't. fake news. didn’t need anything Really? thought vast majority Americans willing take it. need bribes? likely bribe 40$ so.  bags? Germany every supermarket, including Aldi, bags, gotta pay Oh that’ll true countries, going absolutely absurd US too. know politicians going want give control easily.  wrong, we'll probably open things around may-june  1) variant doesn’t appear fitness advantage, it’s spreading like UK variant 

2) showing reduced (but zero) reaction antibodies one set convalescent serum *long* way complicated immune system reacting living human person 

There’s small chance could turn something serious warrants continued monitoring, it’s something I’m wildly worried US needs quickly review approve oxford vaccine. going strong UK That's actually true dumb didn’t react second wave  that? state they're seen one best places work for. pay several $/hr cashier positions, let sit. Maybe standards low around 2 things make company look good. last April remember picking sack potatoes find starting rot. smell. Never back since. dad's friend took demotion could go back hourly rather salaried. made money way better hours hourly. amazon anything ? workers parents days much better. need teach critical thinking schools people ages days simply able parse fact fiction anymore. fair getting lot harder Billions dollars spent every year making distributing propaganda (much high production quality). want like bc live Cleveland area, making kind hard me. people inside summer Florida. reason Texas Arizona surges then. one talking bailing economy. talking absolute best path opening economy.

And bringing pandemic control, getting people vaccinated, walking path normalcy. people comply, going happen, crisis drag longer, economic damage greater. It’s little week since first dose, level protection, though high eventually.

Same before, I’ve significantly lowered risk profile normal behavior I’m shutting house Ugg. Thanks warning! get Pfizer Moderna? Feel better soon! Trader Joe’s better don’t @ soon enough. Absolutely :) know people got fine. Sounds like worst it’ll probably fever days. handle that! I’m hopefully getting shot within couple weeks! Golly. getting second shot day 20. little data getting second shot tricky Los Angeles, locations would second shot, first shot.  big cities mask mandates. unenforceable businesses also made mask mandates enforceable they're private companies. continue take vaccinations. Cool. anti-vaxxer ex-wife Poland, nurse, forced get vaccinated. either get shot get fired. clearly much useless liberty America. People dumb give choice everything. Poland many vaccinations mandatory. went beach yesterday played recreational ice hockey days ago

It’s “wide open” it’s nothing like March TIL. always kind confused people often sounded excited Aldi. years, fair enough new study referencing? Well UK strict lockdown Christmas. Yeah, imagine bad it'd *without* them.

California highly urban two largest cities Earth. Comparing methods places like Wyoming would fucking stupid. Honestly seeing someone hiking trail freaks much it’s probably time speak someone mental health. may bad yet USA Europe, Japan could easily next dumpster fire. Biden would get crucified US reaches herd immunity... knew would much medicine - there’s many manufacturing plants. That’s tiers. risk go first there’s enough medicine. next risk. Least risk go last takes months hopefully shots come online. Well, raised conservatives could kinda close. federal government revealed last week Pfizer reducing COVID-19 vaccine deliveries Canada temporarily bid ramp production capacity European customers.  Pfizer told government make shortfall weeks come meet previous guarantee 4 million doses delivered country end March. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Agreed. lies perpetuated adults should, theory anyway, know better. Yes, know teachers get infected school right? Germany closed school months make dent numbers.

r/coronavirus studies agree me- trust science

r/coronavirus studies disagree views- study terrible Oops! Yeah, work retail read either, hypocritical. mainly responding idea ""American"" thing plenty workers exempt, workplace, people know that. Fauci said would 60,000 deaths back April, 100,000 earlier. revised said 100-240,000. He's map things Roughly 8 grand doctor course 18 years? Whew boy, someone wake Soros. second this. cold Chicago. easy homeless person anonymous sleep airport Yep, plus, Pfizer mass producing facilities. Pfizer produces Belgium; however, juggle international production capacity serve home market first. see means vaccine production Biden evokes defense production act. believe it'll favor Europe.

And even Lonza produces Moderna vaccines Switzerland US, say distribution since works Moderna, headquartered US. know. It’s total apples oranges comparison. I’m sick tired people ranting daily Covid deaths like 9/11. man enough plate.  start smoking? I'm getting worried enough get it, includes overseas, matter time virus evolves vax's efficacy cost analysis concluded cheaper pay get vaccine. would help balance sheets pay it.

That happening here. letting see anything, say? surge way optimistic  [A link actual estimate able see effects vaccines UK (afaik risk people already getting second shot, right?)? death rates going already yet? [We found evidence SARS-CoV-2 infection contacts people **asymptomatic infection less likely** contacts people symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI study too. Asymptomatic. seems similar paper linked. Crazy world.   found Denmark variant L.A. county think resistant vaccines.

/derp Western good. /s one feels like never go back pre-Covid world? Either we'll accept social distancing masking long time, we'll accept living world Covid one among many hazards life.

And since see governments accepting second scenario, feel we'll living crowd-less, masked world least years. glad read since it’s completely different set safety precautions current. /s

I’m idiot fell clickbait title. vehemently disagree.

They press ""send"" tweet.

Yet did. could've let PRC's health service send it, could've let reported one Chinese knock-off services, no: chose Twitter. Twitter become messaging app record lately, fully knew it.

Don't forget: ""Dr. Tedros"" appointed lobbying PRC, presided mass casualty incident country happened hit minority power hardest, he's even medical doctor -- he's got sort Ph.D. public safety obscure university nobody outside country ever heard of.

The appeasing CCP's efforts minimize danger new virus. deaths hands. simply question this. one enjoys restrictions, divisive? Well excessive. restrictions far beyond pre-pandemic planning disease control severe pandemics. I've read CDC 2017 Guidance 2019 NPI guidance. guides reference Spanish flu. 1.4 Million dead adjusted population, 675,000 time. 

The fact cannot criticize restrictions without accused thinking COVID-19 fake insane. Where’s video democrat governors telling everyone go eat “ come China town” ? happened every major US city. someone voted remain... see UK leave EU surprisingly amazing job vaccine front whilst EU lags behind surprising say least. lot hospitals vaccinating patients yet. given may actually need more.

Very likely similar what's happening US- relatives friends given heads ""extra"" doses ahead time know lot areas give shots Sundays and/or holidays. mean get day fucking pandemic.

I really think case. likely bodies report vaccinations today. Tomorrow big number people sub like ""Whoa! must've given many vaccinations yesterday/this morning!"" correct either. They'll reported completely. California update all, know least Disneyland site giving jabs today, probably almost sites are. yesterday too. reporting lag.  Apparently complicated, match current advice. yet know whether vaccine stops infecting others. do, advice vaccinated people continue distancing unvaccinated people wearing masks around them. tricky. guy needs stop talking media. He's good it, make promises without anything back up, since like states roll vaccines faster. much orgy you. Seriously, f\*\*\* WHO, one many excuses anti-vaxers use feel morally superior justify BS.

*""I'm taking vaccine elderly people developing countries gotten it, I'm good person, see. taking vaccine selfless taking selfish"".*

Oh, aware that. workers states eligible paid sick leave law? Ugh. Gotta love Reddit.  still refuse quit try force unpaid OT. job several employees threatening quit implemented OT asked wanted work it. opted time time half. legally required to, plastic shielding customers.... ASMs hourly Aldi. 70 hours per week? Doubtful. Sounds made up. article specify category workers declining vaccine. Based experience mom, far fewer nurses working skilled nursing facilities aides, sanitation workers, administrators, etc. Maybe. nice addition boost AZ Johnson &amp; Johnson arrives. True re: puking less often others. severe GERD/gastritis due hiatal hernia know people degree GERD would puking often, lol. doctor amazed I'm sicker. 

Anyway, thanks reassuring words. Would LOVE hear goes you. heard anyone know bad reaction probably overreacting. EU wide mandate vaccine procurement would include UK would implemented UK left EU.

It matter anyway since optional program mentioned. long since informed this, reality &amp; truth evidently meant lowest possible getting this? UK ceased member EU end January 2020.

And yet, EU rules applied due transition. simple yet evidently impossible dumbest people alive grasp. glad working company Every time see “article” claiming still need distance mask vaccinated, grow stronger stance that. much social shutins want us live like forever, it’s happening. Sorry. gave whole year life protect extremely risk people virus gave fever day. Enough enough. imagine year-end hackathon helped Russians lot speeding ""research"".  realize masks don’t filter air coming in, right? It’s protecting others?

Give us 2 weeks. we'll 450,000 people least two weeks post second vaccine, giving time exposed potentially infected full seven days second shot, already protected. Omg! going literally curbstomp logic d00mers.  Declining cases hospitalizations deaths falling even faster. states keep mask mandates business closures stay-at-home orders won’t thing anymore. Except maybe Cali. People wondering new variants come from? Well stop give virus new human host god damn it. shit job controlling pandemic cases roof, wonder new variation one another. hate articles rely anecdotal evidence. still remember Italian doctors summer noticing milder illness older patients. Yeah... people quit giving little shit vulnerable people get jab deaths hospitalizations start drop. arent going many holdouts full herd immunity.

Also, good luck getting estimated 70-85% vaccination rate US. Ok should. theres problem speak  Well recent news certain variants (everything's technically variant, original like long lost artifact now, emphasize certain variants variants) may different enough immune system recognize thing, is, again, Science magazine article above. Researchers studying city Brazil assumed already reached threshold herd immunity (75% population infected!), believe infections took December. And, indeed, found presence new lineage Covid area. Herd immunity stupid goal. Evidence coming vaccinated individuals likely asymptomatic spreaders. We'll know sure soon. vaccine available everyone wants time Q2 2021, reason can't return normal.

The reason currently insisting people vaccinated continue wearing masks social distancing keep people lying vaccinated. read masks good vaccine?  disease expert Anthony Fauci said Tuesday coronavirus vaccine rollout incoming Biden administration goes planned, U.S. could start see effects herd immunity normalcy early-to-mid fall. Fauci currently director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases Biden's chief medical adviser working coronavirus pandemic. watch: Fauci cited President-elect Biden's goal vaccine 100 million people 100 days good start. better chance get 2022 biden trump pcr came back negative 7 days exposed. mean don’t it?

How dream BS? sure trolling hyperventilation happens unconsciously. guys predict US look like March?  You’re pro capitalist fuckwit. There’s middle ground. We’re shutdowns again. mask mandates? Yeah not? wouldn’t call ruining life. probably high risk events like concerts would need postponed. may advances like at-home testing better treatments may necessary. think could high degree normalcy mid June.

That's pretty long way away.

We're 1M first doses day right now. May 15th (so 2nd shot could done mid June), that's 120M people vaccinated.

If get 50% increase vaccine initializations mid February 165M mid May. that's make improvements takes entire month hit 1.5M first doses. bet exceed those. think going gym example ? high risk place transmission.  shortages ever happen? 

I mean production increasing vaccines coming up, availability. course take year, different wait line turn fighting last batches. 50% news consumers read past headline still problem actually Maybe Norway vaccinated frail people first place. Personnel healthier residents, yes, end waste limited supply. nice joke Frankly, even serious. can't believe genuinly believe put 4 years someone jail ""breaking quarantine"". hope realize noone outside China take joke seriously all.

This. anti vax brother won’t change mind money. He’d come conspiracy theory/bribe/micro chip story instead. let parents get vaccines screw dumb decisions.

If see air quality drop I’m going know I’m breathing increased amount human remains. 

What fuck. Yeah US capitalist country. Good analysis.  Ah we’ve heard months “herd immunity fall” least 15% US population 12. 
So, goes chance that. 
Is bullshit lied to? Again. Aren’t things actually getting much better?

Half country free fall cases. main hotspots look like they’re peak. probably dystopian headline I've read long time. 

The positive hospitalizations clearly inflected California, take long time work morbid ""backlog"". lot people without IDs fee ID, getting necessary paperwork ID. 

Oh lost birth certificate homeless? Okay there's hoops jump get another one, utility bill form proof again, homeless. Basically someone chronically homeless massive hole get of. want send Europe 😂. body programmed recognize strain, whereas, protein spike use vaccine present current strains.

The protein spike thing mutating many strains. Currently lot concern mutations able escape vaccines much might escape antibodies. far, though, believed vaccines continue vaccines ""simulate"" virus way traditional vaccines it.

That's exactly do. temporarily make body create spike proteins, immune system learns fight. entire shell, currently believe important part virus. 16 bed PICU closed taking adult covid ICU patients now. keeping 4 PICU beds general peds ward. cancelling heart surgeries left right allowed 4 PICU beds. Even took adults moved PICU, policy changed one parent only. all. they’re allowed go home, must stay hospital. covid outbreak come parents that’s - can’t imagine alone critically ill child without partner. much cruelty suffering covid. 

(We allow parents child dying.) country cannot afford store transport vaccine, buy it. limitations quickly get people vaccinated due cost handling, people die. people need travel facilities equipped proper freezers (rather local clinic), less people choose get vaccinated. mention, money printer going brrrr last 10 months countries. Let's make overheat choose option many upsides 20x cheaper still effective flu shot GOOD YEAR. Thanks. always love articles bashing DeSantis even though Florida much better New York California. Jesus Christ sub loves sensationalize. point know dozens people COVID. 90% obviously fine within 2-3 days, symptoms all. 

10% symptoms linger weeks, back 100% eventually.

If scares dying, then, again, mental health problem. experience Catholic Church included required sorts things preferred do. parishioners impression mass place exercise freedom make independent decisions what’s best family?? do. need end pandemic get economy back track.  Worldometers said last week. Thats official source pay workers conditions sound appalling. police enforce greater Accra even police don’t wear wear around chin, compliance around 5 - 10% unless government building bank airport it’s 100% 

People know meant wear west Africans always enthusiastic embrace ideas like this. one panic anyway. Everyone cautious take precautions, gather information, adjust based that.

Panic never helps anyone. ethical journalist genuine interest truth fact reporting would report statistics let people policymakers decide themselves. 

The unethical politically motivated journalists consume entire media America reporting one side story maximum doomsday panic.  Can’t make people work free, lol.

But imagine *can* refuse schedule altogether (and fire them) aren’t vaccinated don’t medical condition precludes vaccination.

ADA protects *actually* condition, “ignorant, selfish fuckwit” isn’t recognized condition. be, though.

Should recognized condition, mean, something worthy exemption – something worthy treatment.

Preferably exact wording diagnosis. talking deaths directly caused covid weren’t categorized such. 

Essentially simple math shows avg US x deaths per year 2020 y. 

Subtracting x give excess deaths compared normal years. 

This excess death number higher total reported death significant amount. 

This method perfect, estimate. idea teeth curling makes brain curl expecting another 53,000 doses coming today, de Blasio said. 

Today  way I'm sending food Africa children going hungry. see different, especially since tax dollars contributed it. stop posting articles Companies like Trader Joe Aldi offered financial incentives employees get vaccine. think legal problem. think thing countries ordered WAAAAY needed. US needed around 320 million. ordered around 600-800 million. lot extra doses would delivered countries earlier, everyone benefits.

&amp;nbsp;

The US (and countries) get vaccines early possible, hogging ensure people vaccinated first leaving rest world ""waiting"" start ""giving"" away.

&amp;nbsp;

Its understandable argument ways. ones money want ensure get quickest amounts first. side argument hoard vaccines, lot smaller countries 4-15 million population would vaccinated alongside ""regular"" amount wealthier countries. 

Both sides merit unfortunately, ""borders"" everywhere fight anyone elses. thinking simply wrong. wearing mask even CHANCE prevent spread something way deadlier flu... Everyone volunteer personal responsibility. 

Also. Perhaps government given liitle bit leeway getting things wrong early parts pandemic, zero chance study yet? said 94% substantial, change fact thst vaccinated persons need continue wear mask social distance still get covid19, still pass others. logic it’s distancing forever. Really nothing 100%. light match life right?  There’s brilliant idea: tax write offs companies vaccinate employees. simply commented raise awareness virus discriminate comes age

Of course massively so. look ages deaths etc. - single important factor far.

That mean cases yours. Hope get better. correct. fast food workers 29 years old+. also essential workers. make least amount money it’s exception benefits. excellent news. fully support policy. However pure Aldi style, workers need bring bandaid pay 7¢ one checkout. answer sell ones actually able pay it. unfortunate truth even though vaccines cheap rich nations somewhat expensive poorer nations. least expensive vaccines bought someone else poorest nations.   1st year, get one week.

I feel panicky behalf fresh cashiers. One week even enough wind down, yet alone relax.  would tested phase three environment May 2020 might they're insinuating, nothing suggest true. Ok, I'm one them. Bring on. fancy lot number essentially. see they'd instantly know used someone scanned it, unless scanning equipment hooked centralized system. Yes. Actual scientific analysis says wait make decision stop mask wearing research definitively says can't spread even vaccinated.

Assuming unknown whatever desire, particularly others' lives stake, selfish, narcissistic, unscientific. Welcome sub; congratulations one actual critical thinkers.  know couple old friends spoken “come out” via DM say waiting till post-covid come parents want escape plan. asked March, would’ve predicted Fall restrictions would lifted, wouldn’t waiting till vaccine, could take years far knew back then. 

I never would’ve imagined US still panic mode 10 months.  would explain surge time last year to, say, March 2020? went cases (because obviously learning it) tens thousands within months everything got shut down.

Holiday travel over, entering period northern hemisphere great portion inhabitants confined indoor spaces. Like last year. last year tens thousands people infected. year millions. know already infected considered immune currently, still far infected.

I'm rambling. Sorry. I'm glad seemingly good news add head really great news like think be. I'm trying understand. one I’ve seen actual test results confirming it. approved ones work similarly enough theory one works variant should. Ok, that's true, supposed do? stay closed forever, feel like running options dont get good percentage people vaccinated. government paying vaccine supplies administer. paying administration fee. 
If private insurance, pay fee. medicare part B, pay fee. insurance, site paid fee (the patient charged). Exactly. That’s messaging absurd. course infected getting vaccine greatly reduce transmission. It’s thing makes sense Really downvotes

This sub really weird comes gets downvoted. Given Chinese study found confirmed reinfection 2.5% cases within 60 days initial infection sad, trend see of.  absolutely variants 8 months ago. difference became convenient media outlets start reporting new, exciting headline clickbait last month vaccinations approved many places started immunizing people. Minor caveat, asymptomatic contagious, often shorter hard determine timespan. Symptomatic people semi-definable point highest infectivity risk days. quote article says ""by middle February."" I'm sorry hear that. Maybe something Biden change? (We hope..) new narrative skeptic hangout? Oh hey, young ideologue appears!

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I'm debate merits capitalism vs. economic systems, whether United States effectively enforces laws. I'm speaking practically. hold back vaccinating people others cannot, nations cannot not, vaccinate now?  completely discredits interestingengineering.com media outlet. clicked Reuters report see phase 1/2 100 participants ""effective"" means immunogenic. mean, go anaphylactic shock cashews. always able eat them, one day, eating cashew chicken, went anaphylaxis. going avoid cashews forever people developed severe reaction cashews? China - travel across Europe. know would hard sell, better happened without. Every day since distribution campaign number vaccinations dramatically outpaced number infections. 

Of course, media would rather focus latter statistic. Yes - read that. screen symptomatic COVID validate via PCR test. see 94% reduction symptomatic COVID vaccine. vaccinated group, also likely vaccine prevented asymptomatic infection extent based know levels neutralizing antibodies cell-based immunity, studies powered detect that. think hilarious quick justify selfishness lack care help others expect otherwise. I'm really sorry gone that. brain fog extremely common people long covid. Question... taste smell come back? continue put face mask get vaccinated help someone else cannot take alive. coworker immunocompromised whole team everything keep safe. protect him. means masked 9 straight hours. means get vaccinated available. would nice work needs eat pay rent. best can. need others like part say fuck might die know people like coworker will. Lmao youre stupid jerk aint you. baised sites entirely true. 

There plenty time vaccine efficacy reduced small steps virus evolves, go 95 % zero matter months. 

Klaus Cichutek, head German Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, government agency charge vaccine distribution, said extensive testing updated vaccine required.

If Germany countries skip prolonged bureaucratic procedures, everyone else.

Also, Moderna's CEO said something similar, though I'll admit take grain salt, sells stuff. I'm say matter anyone thinks scenario, young man died, sad family. need vaccines roll ASAP relying herd-immunity getting people killed. lost two friends, myself, utterly sad lonely now. I'm worn out.

I know child got second case Covid symptoms randomly returned killed him, know vaccines legitimate way forward right now. Covid May ruined personally. I'm still nearly same. even remote chance getting virus ADE seriously issue virus, would like stay inside little hermetically sealed box vaccine available area. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Yes That's whole mess people dying disease. people died accident related symptom disease count dead disease ? 

What someone feeling weak due covid falling stairs ? doesn't. 

The data Israel suggests exactly found trial data; persons vaccinated still contract COVID19 still give people. 

Transmission maybe reduced, eliminated. Masks social distancing still required vaccinated persons reasons. say getting vaccine greatly reduce transmission? ensures get sick, likely spread it.

Does make sense get sick infected also able spread virus vaccinated? Maybe. there's proof yet. really tested much difficult track whether vaccine prevents person received getting sick.

I'm really hard time understanding part messaging absurd? Maybe misunderstanding us. come one recommending cooking food? mean sounds legit. incentive. wearing mask avoiding others reduce obesity smoking rates? Ireland advise people 2-3 weeks back get tested unless close contact confirmed case much strain testing labs. working suspected case need test tested positive, takes 4-5 days.

Putting strain would ill advised, though know coming from. would speed process reopening, considering larger antibody response vaccine, would better everyone get vaccine within months year instead relying antibodies last March. Lol think important things argue random moron. Imma get covaxin only. like it. take it, spread fucking misinfo all. damage economy done.

I think get ""anyone wants get stage"" we'll let opted suffer consequences. doesn’t confer immunity though, reduce transmissibility enough R0&lt;1. 

When people aren’t walking germ fountains 2+weeks end, happen. guess teachers strike get de blasio close schools, definitely best interest nyc citizens mind. /s read trial data continues grow - need continue control group thought we’d back outside two three weeks, possible exception handshakes/hugs taboo large gatherings while. situation blew fast. 

Lol young naive back then. subreddit really hurting mental health... every post bad news making seem like never end. think I'm going take week looking subreddit. Lol. First tell countries sharia law Sorry, let restate concern: plan getting vaccinated wondering vaxxed person approaches situations workplace: A) exposed B) vaxxed enough 'proof' stay working?

Ultimately think like said still talked undecided.  Since respiratory, people tend forget it. there's reason fit ideas flu/coronavirus pandemics: understand transmission, (hypothetically) easy control spread harm reduction available. state would backfill additional second doses needed coming weeks doses expected arrive, Polis wrote
 
Does add up? give X first doses week, need 2X week 4 give first second doses week. Unless there's doubling doses point seems like they'll delay second doses pull back first doses 1/25. Assuming talking United States, that's unfortunately true. capture 1/5th 1/10th actual infections country due poor testing. 

According Youyang Gu's estimates, [we hit inflection point days Kids track vaccinated long time anyway (current vaccines even tested, therefore approved, 18 maybe 16). — Today, Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC) announced host memorial remember honor lives lost COVID-19 cities towns across country January 19, 2021, 5:30 p.m. ET. Washington, D.C. ceremony feature lighting around Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. first-ever lighting around Reflecting Pool memorialize American lives lost.

They put date time headline. Misguided anger stupid/mentally ill folks.  think trust anything claims 100% effectiveness. unbelievably stupid irresponsible. hell wrong people. 

Get rid get people care others take jobs. surprised 146%. better worse (I'm kidding, exclusively worse) social understanding jobs like cashiering they're supposed short-term, holdover jobs someone takes little accepting ""real job.""

This bleeds lot things - hourly wage work often times come things like health benefits retirement plans, minimum wage US unconscionably low, etc. 

The social understanding reflect reality, businesses prefer way means hourly workers cheaper.  Idk share post mention vaccinations already pretty much pace next 100 days right anyway, even takes office. literally step tell keep they’re already they’ll reach goal he’ll get credit. It’s good question. think issue virus stay wide circulation. look like horseshoes hand grenades me. ;D People SARS got the, ""brain fog"" never improved. IQ points gone forever. scary hell. Post-COVID get nearly attention should. going end like post-polio entire class permanently disabled people. Nope live America cant nice things. Yup! Money powerful motivator! Article quotes virologist saying ""We compelling data..."". Link original source including data, please. Also, link live thread whenever updated people see referring to. That's human nature, mate. Nothing East West.

We're tribal creatures. plenty, outsiders welcome. we're fucked, mine first. like story Steven King horror books! 

So lucky kid could smell wake up! unbelievable! They're completely wrong - spikes associated holidays - overshadowed general trend virus.

If look case counts states Midwest (see tell exactly Thanksgiving Christmas fall. obvious spikes case counts around holidays. severity spikes massively overstated though. spikes come close reversing general negative trend case counts increase cases lasts couple weeks spike gone downward progression case counts resumed.

We've lot coverage recently spikes, mostly either people ignorant lying generate clicks/inspire fear/whatever. increase saw Thanksgiving almost entirely due increasing cases warm weather states already happening (particularly California) almost nothing holiday. pay close 40% taxes Canada expect give vaccine someone poorer country gets it.

Nobody wants admit reason lot poorer countries poor crooked leaders. want sure haste getting vaccines out, don’t unintentionally create barriers access. hope shared goal dismantle barriers access, unnecessary identification patient affiliation requirements Cuomo changing criteria since early summer make things easier easier open up. criticizes others playing politics he’s nonstop lately Ok let’s try second time. 

**If** vaccine doesn’t prevent spread covid (so vaccinated unvaccinated pass covid rate), young person vaccinated decrease risk immunocompromised person compared unvaccinated person? 

This initial question. seem think can. Please respond something I’m heartless being, really isn’t part discussion Please, tell bad things Canada. Seems like really bad basis.

I mean, he's given lot wiggle room wording ""demand get soft,"" think much trouble getting COVID vaccines flu vaccines.

[56% Americans already willing take soon available another 22% waiting others 56% number already eclipses Gottlieb's high end prediction ~140M american adults. 22% pop ~195M. 

I guess, summary, think he's base would interested seeing would respond numbers presented him. close. Blasphemy reinfections never occur! get downvoted anytime bring subs evidence, celebrity gets sick twice say well it’s one case peed Cheerios?  Deaths care homes England hit highest level since mid-May, according latest official figures, revealed 46% jump coronavirus-related deaths last week transmissible variant Covid-19 breaches care homes defences.

Didn't vaccinate care homes? fuck old people? saying?

Hey 70 year old geezer diabetes. Possibly live 85 5 kids grandkids props local bookies holidays locally every year. Fuck jonny43 said so. unnecessary complete distraction, waste air. 

That's psychotic stuff Jonny. investigated first published. Remindme! February 14, 2021 thing? literally insulted religion. Muslim, know Muslims Charlie hebdo simply publishing fucking cartoon. Right? advocate ""line sand"". public health officials would honest say ""Once vaccinate hell everyone vulnerable large portion less vulnerable population vaccinated, believe spread severity virus controlled, health outcomes better, healthcare system overloaded, mitigation measures restrictions dropped.""

The ""herd immunity option"" messaging harmful dangerous lot people say ""if still wear masks distance forever, point getting vaccine"". year think people smart enough know mom dad (experts governments) telling us full story.  Well get corona mouth either Nope, different company. hop plane get vaccine US...

you mean Colorado. Authorities recommended doctors consider overall health frail patients carrying inoculations, analysis found advanced age serious illness major factors deaths. 

In meanwhile anti-vaccination propaganda used clickbait hysteric articles ''proof'' vaccine lethal trusted. Interesting first thing close schools lmao intelligence profounds  said health issues don’t want get sick Covid even health issues top create vaccine next time. could decide give to. worry, narrative change two days - they'll start touting successful Wednesday. probably hard convince people wear masks hospitalizations people vaccinated Sorry, nonsense. 

It's widely accepted virus endemic. Furthermore Pfizer Moderna efficacy 90% is. really much improved upon. Currently vaccines easily storable dosable (nasal, pill, etc.) looked into. get much better 94-95% efficacy. Remember polio measles still endemic despite highly effective vaccines.

Either way, need completely stop spread within people order end pandemic. case though? Talking Italy here.

Before summer, ""critical"" ICU occupancy set 50%. changed silently 40% around October. changed around Christmas 30%.

The color zone system established around end October, backed set rules questionable say least. They've updated Rt region 1, region get ""orange"" status. Orange means pretty much hard lockdown. Given Rt really cause concern (if 10 cases Rt 1.2, 12 cases day after) Rt [way good period summer, would expect regions like Lombardy basically never go back something resembles normal.

Right Lombardy ""Red"". Means noone gets house except specific cases. Hospitals empty, cases stable 3 weeks. lockdowns then?

In this, people fought back. talk people regular overwhelmingly support lockdowns. even offered exit plan, say ""you stay home decide so"". ""virologists"" tv calling hard lockdown one month whole country hospitals empty cases lowest since October.

I see way this. Yeah. useful comparison look second waves. Pfizer bankrolled testing manufacturing, think pretty applicable.

Or think drug companies come everything house? still care lol  tell ship ID. Oh right... always find odd people keep pretending world magically get better given generation power. always cop avoid thinking hard work making people less ignorant. Lol guarantee don’t give fuck obesity deaths. Thats way bigger problem 1 year covid asked made research bit shared article

 [4 Covid vaccines different stages trial: Serum Institute India : Coronavirus 

This SII though - Oxford Astra Zeneca Sputnik V, though adenovirus based, use different delivery mechanisms introduce COVID protein body. consider two different types vaccine differences quite significant.

- Sinovac vaccines currently development use deactivated virus

- Moderna Phiizer use mRNA “As Espinoza, says knows exactly newborn got exposed COVID-19. Christmas Day, relative stopped gotten tested virus without telling anyone, later found test came back positive.

Now, issuing word caution others, especially parents, take virus seriously.

""If think might COVID, stay home, quarantine yourself. 'Cause son could died one person came over,"" said.

Espinoza says also got COVID-19 relative, two kids. One says symptoms, not.” article, says family thought twice tested positive twice, doctors saying reinfected (which would make think might looked strains). me, assume probably still infection (since many people reported cyclical pattern start feeling better start feeling sick again). definitely think reinfection happens, seems unlikely quickly unless underlying immune issues.  Israel Scotland aren’t. ""X people vaccinated deadly illness"" ""the side"" ""the deadly illness killed X people yesterday."" offering life, then? Would die me?

Or would prefer partner dies caretakers people interact lockdown allowed freely mingle anyone like meeting her?

Which life planning trade trip Applebees? actually think tied COVID hospitalizations deaths. get 65+ people vaccinated, restrictions go window sans maybe masks public spaces.

Personally deal wearing mask public means 20s/30s friends house maybe hit restaurant hand. No. need relearn live reasonable level risk. within 5 mins house. It’s pretty amazing. remember earlier pandemic medical professional posted Discord server suggested COVID-19 likely caused ADE based saw.

Moral story, need see studies types things, can’t jump conclusions based anecdotes. practice again. easier time leading right shoulder left last time it. 400,000 reported cases. unreported cases added total amount make number well 500,000 probably know Publix basically owns Florida government right?

Deaths/day similar story much stark much worse things January December. 

Yes, 7-day averages (new cases deaths per day) slight downward trend past couple days, nothing noise level. similar downward trend couple weeks ago turned around reach new heights awful. looking daily numbers weekend, don't, they're always absurdly reported find Wednesday Tuesday numbers reported crazy high make it.

There simply credible metric shows things improving either case rate death rate. best case, first couple days downturn, would pure speculation. Bloomberg isn’t prediction. It’s adding available state numbers. news article blog called give fuck covid opinions NPR Schools open Oregon new UK variant found populous county multnomah. county consistently cases daily. requirement share medical records would included, otherwise everyone could say got it. Hospital census less half dropping. Big debates opening immediately waiting two months should. they? Cause really, really see happening moment.

Additionally, virus really took Europe mutation made contagious February. mutation would also responsible cases increasing Brazil. Even antibodies longer present system, still immunity cells. Antibodies fade faster, cell memory provides longer lasting immunity. Please sweet baby Jesus, let happen.

Saying definitely reduces transmission based entirely speculation. optimistic hear continue wearing mask socially distance even vaccinated?

Pretty sure talking about.  tried whole lot luck it. governor breaking rules really help things whole lot kids school since last March. live Alabama everything's pretty much wide open here. Thankfully schools online option opted into. 8 year old 2nd grader school taking advantage (though small school 20 kids per grade). follow schools' social media accounts they'll play lip service social distancing masking requirements turn around post pictures maskless kids enclosed classrooms.  I'm also baffled pictures ""friends"" post facebook scout groups getting together maskless, book clubs gathering homes, holiday gatherings, birthday parties, etc. mind boggling.

So kids home summer. Hopefully world normal fall.

Right I'm clinging hope I'll vaccine within next three months beach vacay I've planned June. condo thoroughly wipe relaxing social distancing outside beach. We're going take groceries us eat condo sit balcony. thing keeping going rn.  Going again. mean, know sick days sense time ill. question people talk specific amount sick days. 

If I'm ill, go work, I'm allocated certain amount days annually. Wait Aldi US?? thought exclusivity German/EU thing. president getting vaccinated convince people, know will. California hospitalizations slowly dropping, 9 percent peak January 6th.  it. debts Mortgages different, affected state laws well. yes, majority. Whats point blaming China? doubt effed up, cares?

This point. Even colossal failure Wuhan - rest world plenty warning nothing. I'm speaking specifically U.S.

China warning. U.S. months. United States never implemented robust contact tracing infrastructure robust testing. America even educate citizenry properly NPIs. 

Nobody able convince virus started United States, virus response would dealt better proof pudding. difference hyperbole actually believing conviction middle ground. didn’t enslave 12 million people brought 

Oh see, even denying Atlantic Slave Trade. Thank letting know kind person I'm talking waste time trying explain things someone deny history anyway. good day.  knows? Mild winters? Cold flu season usually peak time southeast, too. always use world peace test think asking people cooperate. World peace far proven impossible, goal would least difficult achieving world peace, unrealistic. It’s weird comment censored incivility, comments breaking sub’s rules wishing harm others allowed stay. seems like you’re trying moderate toward particular opinion, actually encourage discussion. Yeah, I'd say comes necessary facilities personnel produce vaccine necessary regulations standards, trusting third party use company's name. 

That's viruses do, continue keep getting new strains, hopefully within response. never understood “take leadership” meme. Kinda hard us take leadership taken seriously situation. Usually leadership means know show example right? Well, best example here. Vaccine leadership maybe countries well. bad depending ask.

Anyways, sounds like scapegoat snub. Probably since it’s EU. It’s literally WHO’s job warn people. various aunts, uncles etc receive vaccine. not. fucking school indefinitely adults want vaccine asinine. time next three hours. past usually right around 430 Ah, see. thought counting Moderna Pfizer two separate types - including one mRNA type makes sense. say thought Sputnik AZ similar mechanisms, paying much attention mRNA vaccines.

The positivity rate always lower US (even 9-10%). false argument scientific data prove 99% vasectomies successful. data whether covid vaccines stop transmission yet, soon. can't wear cloth face 10 minutes week meantime, pure selfishness. widespread school business closures.
