0,2020-10-27," think technological advancements going forward large population may determinant benefit. advances automation A.I. loads low skill mid skill level jobs disappear. population ready capable preforming higher end types jobs, large labor capable population might detriment. consumers sure, cant buy anything broke. 

I could completely wrong assumptions, think current tech affect population growths affects society? guaranteed. rest Australia NZ managed keep cases control. appear, good contact tracing isolation get dealt quickly. saying another outbreak isn’t possible, things looking pretty good rest country super stoked Victoria join us. sounds brutal damn effective. What? No, chance. locked Trump good.  saw article expensive race KS history. think raised 25 million vs 6 million?! hell going world? 40% Americans get Flu Vaccines normal year, found surprisingly high. Last year, closer 50%. 

Imagine vaccination rates required go school, go work, visit grandma, eat restaurant, travel, etc. 

Even (very low) 40% inoculate, that's enough virus reduce reproduction herd immunity levels. enough people travel to. It'll 'die out' within months. 

The bigger issue mutations. Mutations would less deadly, longer lasting nature. may another vaccine take yearly, science needs keep up. know. wtf. never got shit reading headlines years ago. Oh get wrong - places like New York governor (and city mayor) really helped, people great job spite horrific situation ended in, official government line always much nothing.

Given bad leadership US I'm surprised worse (see UK example bad leadership individuals managing pick slack, managed extremely high death rate given well set handle NCBW situations). like climate change since mid 90s. exact dipshits denying obvious.  ones drag us down. Also, Thanksgiving probably didn’t help, people getting COVID fatigue letting guard boom, 2 weeks later...

I imagine it’s going look like 4 weeks neighbours Thanksgiving Black Friday. Big Turkey doesn’t fuck around. Yep, reddit ""cult masks"".

Like masks magic weapon. reddit, people around.

Limiting number people bus? need that, long wear mask, packed safe - say.

Close schools? need that, make children wear masks protect!  Shit man, like people know reddit works think aren’t following scientific advice?? Yes united States? stupid? Even monthly unemployment was. incorrectly classifying pandemic stimulus check. finish taxes time get mine definitely got his. 

Jfc people pay attention country live ffs Island virus took hold, uncontrolled, untraceable community transmission August 700 cases per day. would grown exponentially now. took control completed elimination lock successfully. turd is. See, deflecting something called ""straw man"". Let break you:

Straw man: building fake, oversimplified position someone attacking instead addressing argument hand. 

Im people saying *feel*, never said that, made question easier attack. also called ""loaded question"". Look too. 

What *am* something entirely different. I'll address reread comments rephrase question productive way healthy argument like mature, intellectual people. 

Or don't. really care. Also according prime minister, we've defeated covid june&lt;&lt;

This lie. said virus ""was retreat"" July, disappeared. time opposition leader Borys Budka said coving going disappaer September.... Amazing public policy following scientific advice? pretty clear now? much able catch ‘rona airplane. hell watching insane Wuhan videos January thinking wouldn’t happen elsewhere? China totalitarian greatly helps, hurts, pandemic response. steamroll right individual rights quarantine neighborhoods, etc. turkey hill gas station hours ago rural pennsylvania berks county, nobody wearing masks. 
Local school districts pics facebook kids huddled together wearing masks, sports teams wearing masks. 
Everyone thinks joke, Trump signs everywhere, etc.

I think north philly going get slammed. Wow live there’s 6 people given grocery store? I’d take honestly hate say Europe well opened fucking schools. I'm blaming children course dont want (I assume lol) stupid everyone hole appartment nothing 3 months state needs next round workers bees ready harvest. Hopefully get celebrate mother's 100th birthday August,had miss 99th... Ny/NJ first hit indeed manage flatten infections massively same. I'm sick Fauci giving softest possible response. since Feb, back telling public buy masks. Try read something situation Czechia example... Wouldn’t high death rates NY CT due fact brand new doctors hadn’t figured treatments well now? mean it’s still terrifying deadly, least doctors experience now. people? Instead leaving rude ass sarcastic remark, try fully understanding question. theme parks reckless, “according science”, open? Nj going peak soon. already starting. Infections went massively since start virus what? exactly mean. Can't even look context. said contact tracing, one main aspects helped early also Japanese notorious discipline adhered guidance mask usage. narcissistic responses self-indulgent perceived knowledge blind coherent conversation anyone might even slightly differ opinion. never said Japan continuing lockdown country tests daily amazing everything do. said excelled example country fantastic job. death rate fantastic population, try convince completely normal. difference US far gone implement initial aspects Japan did. said Japan great job say ""nuh uh, suck even take serious"" Okay now, goodbye. They’ve tried restricting abortion past too. last time years ago. Fauci can't make masks mandatory - that's leaders' jobs... 

And say ""leaders"" very, loosely. Yeah, there's lot superstition paper burning like ""superstitious"" things people halloween. NZ great job handling covid, I'm mainly talking world whole Fwiw everyone wears mask NJ part covid still gone. helps smoking gun. 

Especially combination poor control legislation Florida compared Andrew Marr’s interviews annoying shit. It’s tabloid journalism, others like sides pond significant contributing factor shitshow find now. Weak questioning government officials important issues, lack meaningful fact-checking. Argh. used quality reporter bullshit chat show joke. Pity, seems we're maybe months away vaccine, infections exploding several European countries, people can't wait months.

Here Ireland level 3 level 5 lockdown, seems halted rise cases, backdrop impatience, conspiracy theories increasing protests.

Czech republic, Poland Italy warning us fast things spiral control. could ended delaying restrictions weeks. Fauci dick. That's can't tell anything good news. Right now, number covid deaths Poland (adjusted population) still much lower Sweden. field study specifically targets spread control infectious diseases. Macron screwed worse Trump isn’t. either lying repeating lies. see lot America ""do nothing""

Even Florida something far late far little

The new York Philly metro ""do nothing"". case numbers would NEVER dropped dramatically . 

Stop thinking Florida Texas, etc whole country
 there's going total solar eclipse US April 2024.  Religious exemptions allowed. strictly (legitimate) medical issues. ""gut feeling"" says ""Emergency Room"" casually, and/or hints part patients see, ""Emergency Department"" used formally (cf. [Official NYC gov denote whole department including many ""cogwheels"" support frontline workers background.

I may wrong, though, English first language teachers mixed AE school. article even mention test trace! Nothing whatsoever, despite critical successful strategy. It’s gonna take maybe even three years get outta mess. usually get one wave per year per country.  Australia skipped year bc covid measures. Nah, White House staffer I'm convinced McConnell cronies already shorting market shady back channels like way Loeffler traded early inside info work field disagree. new York metro light years ahead country though winter tough density okay, expect countries (especially Americans) know much information us. 

We're aware rest world barely aware exist probably think live outback hunt crocodiles, ride kangaroos throw shrimp barbie.

We're also aware people overseas probably think Sydney capital (if they've given thought subject). never been, however largest well known city. They'll probably use palestinian children ginneapigs   read handling covid pandemic US, situation Poland still better, now. That's hit first densest area country. 

If nyc Florida deaths wouldve astronimical. 

Also poor quality senior care institutions problem across country. get fixed NJ law(and presumably NY) hundreds thousands died greatly improve protection wearer need mask it. beginning days COVID used surgical mask facesheild protection. \\

Now get PAPR best.. fair criticism seem several times. new guidance came area maintain physical distance reduce social contacts 3 cohorts bubbles - example, work, family gym class. Wait week. incredibly important deciding emergency regulations needed, resource allocation. arbitrary metrics set matter? They're literally made up. fucking cares learn algebra year next year? Isnt still centred Kelown?. medium sized city. seems whole lot young people close geographical area driving numbers.

And I'm going surpised numbers Vancouver spike another week anti mask protest attracted 1000 people alowed occur. Scott AtlAss said herd immunity would work! Sorry clearly covid 19. contaminates uses available chlorine slightly faster. It’s naturally formed contaminates like rainwater, algae, body contaminates keeps water clean. old pool always fight bunch rain washing dirt algae screen roof it, switched salt water. indoor pool smell? That’s chloramine. smell always good indicator time shock pool. Oh yay, that's exciting! look upside-down, looks decreasing tho. thing US lot state local leaders tried. There’s significant variability states measures taken severity outbreaks. example, San Francisco Bay Area better European metropoles size Koi? Wasn’t enforced, lot people Denver community cared enough neighbors stay home much could. 2,211 cases today... Yeah, need make change! ... fuck big future republican politics, bud. banning guns schools Federal level constitutional, mask mandate. Commerce Clause gives Federal government unlimited power. Technical epidemiological wave requires something like 90% reduction cases peak lasts specific number several weeks? like recessions depressions. 2008 GFC devastated world economy government deficits almost decade, many people never recovered job financially, never technically Depression. Perhaps there's social cohesion homogeneous societies? cares Keebler elf dork thinks Tourists come Ohio? shocked many people can't stand him.

They plain ignorant. people listened AF beginning numbers would way lower now.

*“Now, we're getting cold weather, came back worst we've ever had, 80,000 per day,” Fauci said.*

Just wait till gets closer winter watch 80k hit 6 figures.

*""We this,” said. “I'm absolutely convinced nation, pull together, fundamental common-denominator public health measures, get this....*

Good luck that... sides blame. Republicans proposed smaller stimulus package, Dems refused vote Congress. want get point safely go public without wear masks time vaccine mandates chance happen anytime soon. agree cases clearly good spot vaccine yet, masks best intervention time thus mask mandates make sense. China pay parts wages lost like countries? doubt it. always two months behind Europe Italy , France Spain went 2nd lockdown. 2nd wave coming, time new year seems problem countries follow advice. Sweden shit now. one really knows. Oh fucks sake. everything Trump.   There's good chance could end March, we'll see. Right wing politics literally rise internationally, isn’t America. What’s Europeans always bringing America No, people work places do, people meet couple friends, go work places, on. can't believe explain lmfao. /r/lockdowncriticalleft good sub want edge  realize cases won’t drop zero day vaccine comes out, right? one thing get shot typically takes around 2 weeks body reach peak antibody production actually immunize you. also take weeks months distribute give everyone. Depending vaccine ends may need 2nd booster shot 30 days, means you’d continue wearing mask socially distancing 30 days get 2nd shot. didn’t follow directions could actually catch spread others vaccine fully kicks in. 23 year old hospitalized, yet Reddit PhD's tell like mild cold anyone thats nursing home. Um currently things? live shitty area also work provided healthcare. fucking sick stupid people like you. Please fuck off. shockingly stupid man. puts anal log pool. dying guaranteed white?

More white people die per year US group that's largest single group. I'm actually working Google Sheets, I've finished Trump's events August- October (so far) I'm loss Biden's seem held hardly in-person campaign events certainly nothing large scale without masking social distancing 🤷‍♀️ local districts offer mix mainly hybrid remote. selected remote, set special teachers would remote. remaining kids split groups hybrid. school lessons get work following day(s). school models could somewhat float numbers. couple remote rest went hybrid. think hybrid working decently well older kids (7-12). Harder younger ones. ""how make American politics?"" think it’s pretty decent country Central Europe antibody headlines misinforming ones. horrible.

Worried reinfection? studied, depth, countries deep pockets find out. study demonstrated reinfection .01% prevalent **forced** environment (where reinfection decline time nearly viruses.

But antibodies products innate immune response. 

Ask yourself, better yet, ask Google - body produce antibodies?

It's really fun learn antibodies deal misinformation news organizations. Bro need talk therapist something even fellow anti lockdown crowd seem think youre bit deep end. Youre upset current personal situation cant see making act completely paranoid fashion. letting emotions trump rationale. Schools super surfs up, bitches. UK in?  argument, feel strongly ""liberty"" issue you, perhaps actually experience yourself. antibody headlines misinforming ones. horrible.

It’s like neighbor two houses pyromaniac likes play matches. sets house fire, next door neighbors house goes smoke. Finally, fire reaches you.

While fire came next door neighbor’s house, they’re fault starting fire.

The blame squarely China disgusting eating habits failure contain virus spread overseas. Good maybe see another stimulus (but doubt it) Found American. long Donny's vaccine - shit deadly. lmao. fucking nutter we've consistently average 40k cases per day since start testing. never went down, hence never left first wave. fault uneducated dolt. amount people movies depends what's showing movies, what's showing fuckall moment. think bars/stadiums/nightclubs better barometer since requires desire socialize saying we're still first wave visually implies never significantly lowered spread

Not necessarily true. dramatically lower infection rates first wave, first peak passes. second wave comes there's another peak. think riles people federal response.

So country can't third wave never really gone back much lower level.

Calling first wave still acknowledges failures. Yep seeing 0 positive 20k tests brilliant. Let's hope people keep getting tested. outsider looking in, numbers every day drawfed nations monthly covid numbers... pause drop... dropped USA standards, anywhere else would LV5 leaving house, army rolled lockdown. 

Your wave 1. Totally. mean plateaued best. 

My small country thousands cases 6 plus month now. graph steady. yep. Absolutely. sake ill-informed, newspeak implemented. Especially calls news source. Accuracy logos paramount dealing information. change definition word mean literal opposite truly means, foolish result confusion. go hospital. Practically whole healthcare system collapsing   Lmao, couple weeks ago, people ""yEs cAsEs rIsInG DeAtHs dOwN!!""

Dumb fucks. imagery disturbing. I'd say we're 99% mask usage major cities overall. August before-March levels ""re-opening"" fast opinion, started 2nd wave. 

Masks work perfect opened indoor restaurants gyms etc are. many people started act ""normal"" party private without masks too. 

We blame that's fair, vaccine approvals coming another month distribution time get shots kill pandemic. 

PS- Canada 240 deaths per million. Better western europe (except Germany) 500-600+. think US 600 330 million population going big numbers. top /u/skadsh said also delayed expected we're easing restrictions announcement 2 (maybe 1) days waited results testing blitz part metro Melbourne seen cases comfortable with. results came back negative announcement went ahead. lack testing particular concern here. arrogance saving lives. Period. advantage human intelligence learn others. Also maths make predictions. Poland voted spreading Covid, Poland got spread Covid.

Seems like system working intended? people die COVID. WTF about?  Pray harder? agree. It’s never ended. got

This getting ridiculous. yet. Give months quarantine drinking alone home we’ll see... Look, know difficult understand, death rate one dimension. goal always prevent overwhelming hospitals. actually happening different parts country, others well along way. But, dumbasses like *only* look one statistic heard fox news one time. precautions enforced. gym opened two months. Everyone wears mask times, rarely get within 10 feet someone. issues. also puts log analogy. don’t live country I’m also teacher. It’s impossible teacher one method brilliantly. would rather half-arsed job multiple options?? 

I don’t need lecture sacrifice social cohesion. country sacrificed, stuck together made restrictions activity. virus freely circulating. People often shit Redditors armchair warriors... try harder enlighten people? Ive pressured dad vote Democratic, he's still ""both parties same"" camp. 

In neighborhood? live orthodox Jewish neighborhood NYC; yesterday caravan ""Jews Trump"" honking block 15 minutes. convince people anything.

Am supposed touch business owners whose businesses failed? I'm representing business owners Melbourne, I'm guy Reddit telling experience lockdown.

 know people lost jobs, company revenue 50% severe pay cuts, know people high school people aged care, generally sharing sentiment, bad. harder others, never denied that.

Just businesses failed invalidate feelings others. Look number business failed US without lockdown.

 right answer. lockdown, would people side mourning loss parents people furious people died.

As aside, suicides Melbourne increased compared last year. Italy significant communist party. much Russian agitation? Flying bad, bad idea matter what.

I definitely agree getting cold already, snow, fires created poor air quality. Basically already reason stay home. order that, order paper. Yeah, ego. million people died this. 


Show compassion lost going lost. Musicians high totem pole this. It’s nice vaccine don’t ever forget what’s important something serious thing choosing locked v choice matter. hate hearing kind comment people outside Melbourne honest. comparable experience. stupid word use anyway. single wave equation SEIR model. purely public communications term. public communications term gets misinterpreted public, good term begin with.  I’m waiting 3080 finally enjoy rdr2 properly, Cyberport/Nvidia really screwed deliveries know one completely brain washed think either one good .both straight activist larping journalist don’t understand laws wearing clothes public, wearing mask that’s critical public health unconstitutional. I'm sitting pretending cavities go away couple years that's totally works. They'll wait better. (Thankfully, hurt, like afford fillings anyway. even know appointment preggers spring.)

 
Not looking forward little one getting first teeth day head holiday season, though. infringe right exposed fake flu. /s think it, waves could even meaning actually. would divide US(or area) grids take discrete time steps one day, assign grid height based either corona deaths infections day grid, would literally see wave propagating 2D space like water real world.....

A travel group report says flying safe. doctor whose research cited says link WaPo non-paywalled article lives pretty much nowhere place.

RIP lost lives it. talk gf respectful manner random strangers internet... 49 passengers onboard tested positive novel coronavirus, even though flight 17 percent full, according report released last week Irish Department Public Health. 13 passengers went infect 46 people throughout Ireland, report says, “demonstrates potential spread SARS-COV-2 linked air travel.”

god dam. 

the seating chart infections place. We'll find retrospect only. hard say right now. exact thought. soon we're one major step (e.g. vaccine approved US, even distributed etc), LOTS people take ""it's over, let's move on"" rather recognising world different place post covid. No, it’s like snowstorm northern US winter, never opening schools businesses back even though roads plowed “we shut anyway people could hit black ice die”

I realize never agree, try see perspective. shoes March April. terrified virus seriously concerned. kept scientific releases data time changed view based that. everyone health anxiety worried getting cold. wearing fucking mask longer too. want that's perfectly fine expect everyone else too. deep economic depression 1920 1921 though. True. You’re right. thanks misinformation lies coming Trump, half population paranoid vaccine. It’s going long bumpy ride, unfortunately.    It’s healthcare system also reaction state, country state social welfare system.

My country (Australia) locked pretty quickly start.

Western Australia Queensland locked borders fast hard every state international realised serious. Northern Territory Tasmania South Australia followed soon after.

The difference state leaders basically said F* this, no, decisively despite opposition slammed borders shut even playing hardball refusing open despite entire country nearly completely beaten covid - cautious, aren’t willing risk it.

Contact tracing states pretty good. went various stages lockdown start, Western Australia put homeless people hotels get streets hotels go lockdown customers. government paid hotels house hotels wouldn’t go bust people vulnerable safe.

Canberra good contact tracing able avoid much lockdown border closing.

In NSW Victoria (Sydney Melbourne) didn’t close borders. 

In NSW nearly got control - F* contact tracing cruises docking - Victoria got hand contact tracing went rails. 

Victoria nearly became like rest world. control climbing fast everywhere else.

The difference that, rest country okay support states behind basically one last push get line covid safe country went extreme.

They went complete police lockdown. Curfew. Regional city suburb style border closures. could home certain period time, certain reasons. majority businesses close. 

If didn’t adhere rules, police would fine resisted, they’d arrest you. simple.

But saying - didn’t leave people nothing.

Our government paying $1100 couple every two weeks (so two person family would get $2200 every fortnight plus could take $20,000 retirement fund every working Australian - employers pay 9%-11% extra part contract super fund access emergencies turn 60.) 

They frozen rental evictions, gave relief banks utility companies could pass homeowners renters - could get leases easier, could negotiate temporary rent decrease mortgage stop.

They scheme businesses would paid $1500 fortnight per employee kept employeed too. goal this, example Target Kmart could close doors go bankrupt keep paying employees - stay home. opened again, hadn’t lost employees, save jobs big corporations.

They gave bailout funds industries needed it. stop collapsing. huge lockdown massive pain ass. Big companies still pay massive rents people rent store space, amusement parks zoos still bills pay animals feed. 

But point - Victoria went total lockdown - lasted three months hell earth end show pain?

Lockdown eased them. zero cases day. 400-700 climbing.... zero new. Low mortality. it.

The whole country low cases now. either control people returning home overseas point forcefully quarantined hotels two weeks.

Is harsh? Yeah. Very. got paid stay home everybody agree government obviously didn’t totally leave us nothing. 

It worth country feel safe, bittersweet terrifying know friends around world world general suffering wishing could same. I'm also okay that, please tank get dividends December FFP2s FFP3 ideal 8 hours. personally use mine 16 hours two separate intervals. I’ve using shitty offbrand ones (because it’s impossible get Drager/3M ones country) far I’ve problems. got contact 50+ Covid patients. Ahahahahahahahahahahahahagaha people listened AF beginning numbers would way lower now.

I distinctly remember clip saying masks useless people East Asia countries ""can want"" seemed dismissive efficacy. changed mind later. 

So mind hurts credibility bit arguing favor masks government telling people wear them. Unfortunately, we've taken American exceptionalism seriously, tend think anything outside USA backwards. makes hard Americans accept countries better way. 

Americans also ideologically driven, requires degree belief makes difficult reconcile reality belief. 

You end mass denial, belief nobody could done better us. travel industry written report reposted every 2 hours past couple days might entirely correct??? people willing take vaccines :( It’s okay. Life feel far vibrant time inside. One day!! true lol. misguided appreciation Fountainhead good 3 month period, dont think I'll rereading anytime soon, I'm blind (repressing?) many flaws. woman really rationalized loner-ness (and probable rape fantasies) January 22nd: ""Well _obviously_ make go away immediately - it'd give away."" also bad news vaccine hopes. Trump claim managed get us first wave. Actually maybe not. 

In France, places hit first wave places less hit second. 

Since large part population places caught immune, spread significantly slowed.

As America first wave never really stopped lot people caught it, spread second wave probably slower wave flatter. Source? good news longer-lasting IgG antibodies persisted patients four months, long researchers able look. Levels IgG antibodies also served indicator presence protective antibodies capable neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 lab. Even better, ability didn’t decline 75 days onset symptoms. longer-term study needed, findings lend support evidence protective antibody responses novel virus found 6 months immunity lost, thats plenty time. Giving shot health care workers risk groups every 6 months would fairly minor problem. Yes.

The masses confuse personal FREEDOM, national FREEDOM.

Totally different.

This existed even pandemic, reason mess, compared perception less FREE countries.

With seriousness, still see people smoke, vape, drink, make kinds poor lifestyle decisions.

Which affect us contagion, healthcare costs, much more. Thailand Vietnam islands. UK island.

This good game, it? Peeping Tom patrols. guessing here, public relations seems likeliest suggestible people be. Hitting third wave - bad - could cause infer we're going ""later"" wave, ipso facto nearing end pandemic (or least, Churchill would say, end beginning)..

Whereas merely first wave, sounds like we're middle long-term pandemic could go forever. agree. ""blatant disregard"" key phrase me. truly frightening. Can't second wave never leave first one *taps forehead* people refusing simple shit Got it! Fear is! 2020 nutshell.

Probably 2021 since there's 60+ million idiots country. thought that. God bless y'all. Absolutely US worse human rights record China, especially regarding foreign policies. naive? sounds like eugenics, ok Also regional Victoria (Bendigo) couldn’t prouder Victorian. it’s terrible see many businesses hurting Melbourne, measures put place Andrews government saved many lives put us great position open Christmas second concurrence. titlegore definitely would be, maybe positive way. confirm antibodies change behavior, may show effectiveness vaccine clearly get checked up. test positive antibodies change behavior get ill, may prove vaccine doesn’t work something they’re looking prove. question asking is, 'What's making sick?'""

""We answered it."" sounds like skit horrible B movie, happy ending vaccine arrives Christmas, everyone celibrate again. Enjoy happy feelings go back normal land, took little get used again. Wishful thinking finest. 

We're gonna learn hard way true third wave like. let's see, that's... 24 reinfections... 43 million cases. veritable fucking explosion them. sorry, guess right! doctors learned coronavirus treatment methods improved, death rate U.S. also dropped. May, 6% diagnosed cases proved fatal, less 3% today. improvement reduce perceived severity.

People look trends like let lulled believing they’re less susceptible COVID-19 disease’s severity isn’t bad. all, one might reason, it’s eight months haven’t gotten sick. think clear United States handled situation badly, many European countries: gross understatement.

It true per capita United States actually done better, despite people say measure matter without relative comparitors sense spreading. think United States good fortune massive country terms land mass fewer bodies infect close quarters. New York good indicator happen densely populated areas. hand, lot people United States go work otherwise they'll destitute one right mind going risk families homeless almost anything - respect people United States afforded bit leeway commenting.

I can't say happening United States daily basis every day interaction, England would never guessed many people would blatant disregard well-being country people within it. certainly led re-evaluating country sickening watch really. There's cost wearing mask though. data death rate age second wave ? heard aggressive toward young people first one data backing ? Nope, I'm millionaire compared vs given parents I'm way successful, goes people. swim shit-pool, Randy Nope, I'm millionaire compared vs given parents I'm way successful, goes people. kind difficult pin US lesser extent, UK.
Certain European countries well defined graph indicates success systems put place deal COVID. Covid needs end sooner rather later sake many people vulnerable dying.

The thing worry relation economy mess millions fallen poverty.

If stimulus package able passed worry vaccine starts rolling people say, ""Oh covid over. There's vaccine now. There's need stimulus."" idea means practice. 

Boosters every year basically vaccine terms logistic societal challenges involved. Victoria Australian State, named British monarch, Queen Victoria, US States named honour British kings queens e.g. North South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia Maryland. government previously plan. administration dismantled plan proceeded tell everyone pretend danger didn’t exist. can’t say it’s government’s fault responsibility lies corruption certain souls. Agreed. wish could ""fail"" bad life. Chinese, would like say widely reported health QR code played little role China's fight virus. really effective large-scale strict quarantine contact tracing, well widespread use masks. Large-scale strict quarantine effectively interrupted spread virus; masks reduced infection rate people make necessary interpersonal contact quarantine period; contact tracking quickly identify potential infected persons prevent continuing infect people. Although strict blockade caused great inconvenience people, also produce best blocking effect. society withstand long-term blockade isolation, contrary intuition, strict blockade harmful mild blockade. Since virus spreads quickly, best implement measures early enough. addition, ability detect virus large scale essential quickly find infected person. vaccine 70% effective good enough. We're waiting 9th generation vaccine go back normal. also mandatory euthanasia scientifically illiterate idiots threaten collective survival stupidity, either. Even then, think people still refuse take seriously would make excuses.... he/she old, underlying conditions, rare, got fine, can’t stay locked forever, “mental health” Even 1/3 won’t take vaccine 66% will. vaccination rate actually better rate regular influenza shot. 50% Americans got flu shot last year. CDC’s national goal always 70%. clearly see two peaks followed period declining daily new cases. right we're third period rising cases. 

The daily cases always keeping comparatively high baseline US never decline number could consider ""it contained""

Unlike German, they've daily case number reduced 200 even below, compare historical peak (about 5000per day), could say ""they've got controlled"". recently daily cases sharped 15,000, call ""the second wave"" Hoping best you, Australia rest world. Glad life getting back normal you. lack better one, one works too. Thanks! Doin’ bit happy dance here. 🎶 inb4 cOroNaVIruS hOAx might case. one thing understand risks involved civil discussion hard could close schools strategies might put place reduce risks.

Another thing done across europe: start principle schools functioning regardless risks involved cases rose close shops take measures, wasting even time. Proud Victorian embarrassed related many dAn tYrAnT idiots. Thing Sweden functioning state apparat good professionals working government, mostly choices got right 70s, current crop politicians self serving, arrogant spinners everywhere else. FHM tried address issues month ago, government sat issue delayed it. culture minister 40 year old teenager dreadlocks married shaman (this joke). Everytime culture industry artists tried bring attention points failed. (Ok arguing here, but.) 

You could something. 

I think scary real-worldsign immunity doesnt last Belgium example one worst hit countries spring. cases though roof again.

Shouldnt immunity stop that, atleat partially. ""Work began Oxford vaccine January. Called AZD1222 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, viral-vector vaccine made weakened version common cold virus causes infections chimpanzees.""

Even better news: rDNA-based vaccine easier get across ""it's conspiracy alter human DNA"" crowd :) point wave become tsunami? vaccines prevent infection. Yes people poor immune responses still get symptomatic infection, also ones likely get seriously ill. Ya I'm news, grass green Face palm. world happening. Immunity given natural infection immunity given vaccination likely differ well btw. Alaska Air also blocking middle seats (through January 6, 2021) vast majority infections, Covid everything else, happen home work. Sharing train wagon stranger 20 minutes probably got covid legalise marijuana emergency law Well masks subject human behavior. cannot relied on. Neither lockdowns. Humans gonna human.

The could said seatbelts. Almost everyone know wears cops ticket catch without one. Unfortunately America police want enforce mask mandate, did, we'd closer control. First wave, we've also three regional waves virus rolled across country. IMO think 8 months solid. think realistically year 8 months enough vaccinate lot people. Calm jamal. Yoi got told stay inside fight war. reason went long due quite population ignoring restrictions.. Italy US though, people get paid lockdown working? it, “really not”? Well firstly, March/April probably better given documented cases February, even tells us immunity appears likely 8 months say.

That mean cannot start wane coming months, waning entirely line plausible current scientific understanding virus virus's. exactly scenario we're trying avoid: swiss couple invited 200 guests wedding, several infected SARS-COV-2 showing symptoms; two weeks later village celebrates Oktoberfest, Thanksgiving new cases infections showing symptoms COVID-19 popping around village.
The initial wedding guest agreed keep silence avoid quarantines, local people agreed keep silence avoid economic issues related village uncontained uncontainable outbreak.
Only national Minister Health Affairs intervened, couple celebrating wedding agreed disclose who's attending wedding; way trace Oktoberfest.

F*cked majorly.  Great discipline. Good people keep vigilance! never issue seat belts...

I always put on... folks stupid, now, them, even need buckle move car parking space since wont run without belt all...

I still find anology better others (esp. Anti maskers side...) well yeah

did numbers ever go significantly stabilize shoot up?

ofc they're still first wave Actually, seat belts protect others. prevents secured person becoming projectile vehicle. knew someone killed backseat passenger refused wear one. passenger lived paraplegic. selfish moron online anti-mask crusader. brags refusing masks says hopes infect anyone enforcing wearing them. definitely candidate personality disorder. confident vaccine approved, ""might-harm-me"" scenario discarded. risk occidental governments willing accept risk moderate effectiveness. absolutely worth hurt like hell time. Went ups downs lockdown. big periods hopelessness, especially salary slashed wife went jobseeker, held on. 

Tomorrow (first day lessened restrictions metropolitan area) magical.

That's entirely dependent long immunity lasts for, article says immunity may beginning wane, know yet.

Hope helps. Masks work. Thank saying thing American it’s ridiculous really rest Australia already achieved this. NZ also COVID normal months, swiftly contained second outbreak. articles anything that? people downvote you?  know either, although guessed right context.  Dude, science tell you. scientist might wrong observations telling you. still seeing reinfections whether test Oh fancy that, coincidence. speedy recovery!

Can please explain 'objectively wrong', I'm practicing scientist seem misrepresenting science actually say can't. agree everything wrote. Reinfections probably lot higher know.

But, 6 confirmed reinfections, 43 million cases. even 100 000 times reinfections hidden. 

There still 1,5 % chance reinfections.

And take account lot 43 million cases reality.

Hower say immunity likely dissapear se cases reinfections. still atleat 8 months immunity, statistically.

Seems lot people confused use ""bottomed out"", Meriam Webster reach lowest worst point usually beginning rise improve Yeah, lockdown probably solution want close schools, need force companies let people home. diagnosable! No, different parts country different waves. know what. I'm probably introverted extroverted. social situations make fucking effort. go out, host parties, work hard socialisation important. fucking hate self-described introverts use excuse fulfill social responsibilities. okay hide basement entire life, okay make friends responsibility arrange social events, constantly one reaches out. also okay poor social hygiene affects mental health.

But flip side, fucking pandemic okay like ""I'm extrovert, go party"".

I look science dude. Part science making observations. observations tell you? Ken oath mate really understand point this. There's set behaviors call ""Antisocial Personality Disorder"" there's set people clearly give shit protecting people germs... seems obvious set would significantly overlap. I'm missing something here- reason even bother studying first place. FYI stand ""fucking yelling information,"" JSYK Best move minimize travel matter state live in. people could stopped selfish assholes couple weeks could beaten back March. no. 7 months later still getting butts kicked. 

I 100% understand want life resume able play see friends. Hell, I'd hug every stranger passed since miss touching much...but idea might inadvertently kill someone...

Just stay home. go out, wear GD mask correctly keep distance.  Ok guys? study Brazil though. results would probably different elsewhere, still. Ok dont surprised scientific studies valued ""how feel"" Yep worth  seat map suggests 4 groups traveling together infected, 1 (or possibly 2) individual passengers becoming infected.

If infections actually result traveling airplane, passengers spreading among group family/business associates, would expect single/non-group passengers become infected. That’s T-Cells edited thought needed explanation. Source what? make point. Obesity likely kill covid. BUT, 99.6% still means .4% chance death. 

If wearing mask they’re isn’t ruining life cares. That’d like telling “hey gun there’s .4% chance bullet it. try shoot you?”

If options “mild/no inconvenience” “.4% chance getting shot head”, I’ll take first one day. literally wear mask large groups. I’m already never large groups wearing mask isn’t hard bothersome like bunch idiots claim. not? we, young healthy non-frontline essential workers, aren’t vaccinated next year meant colossal failure distribution.

It looks like expert field, since absolutely certain long distributing vaccine entire world take. Please enlighten us then. 

Do know anything manufacturing process vaccine? know anything refrigeration needs transport storing affects whole supply chain? maybe tell us know actual vaccine administration capacity constraints, unlimited vaccine supply? long take administer vaccine, trained people be? 

With current setup, country live performs ~59000 tests day, 1% country's population. people working test stations administer vaccine, tomorrow? doubt it. 


So please enlighten us knowledge, stop talking ass, enough misinformation is. know answers questions, listen experts say young people probably wait 2021. policy goes: schools entertainment venues (bars, restaurants, clubs). Getting r0 1 sustained period time refer ""suppressing virus"". Many countries achieved couple months therefore considered second wave now. plz roll vaccine (with cherry top) feel like you’re fucking me, I’m sure. I'm definitely going call bad news, there's enough data (at least west) suggest good actually is. dont want one people using valuable societal resources, yeah maybe ill write ill see. know atleast one credible journalist looking it. 

Totally agree youre last paragraph. Yeah, back spring remember Swiss hospitals taking French patients overwhelmed regions. makes sense try every resource available. cling particles air hours, requires airborne precautions. Agreed. aren’t basic steps prevent spread virus. US closed asylums 60s. We're seeing consequences now. Ahhh is. shows every thread. equally clever ""water wet"" guy? did, add info already knew. right (and getting downvoted anyway), guess would OK response locking travel states.

The federal government seized redistributed medical materials states tried anyway, regardless official line 'let states handle it'. think way pass much responsibility possible. take upside-downvote yup agree Distraction fallacy Yea, no. kind studies obviously cannot filter myriad confounding factors. going harsh... hope somewhat swing We're still drowning one big tidal wave coronavirus brought us ocean. Yes is, needs cured I'm proud tinfoil hatter, new rabbit hole! thank  Ummm. superior. kind Fucking moron wear piece fabric face pandemic? 

The type lunatics filmed screaming ranting supermarket employees.  question

A question response statement: ""*For personally happy coexist bipedal gas bags get confirmation elderly vulnerable longer considered risk.*""

I think reasonable ask demographics (elderly one) ever elevated risk compared rest population. 

In words, ever point ""t*he elderly vulnerable longer considered risk.*"" ? Melbourne, Australia, we’ve come lockdown can’t yet visit other’s houses large groups. Reason being, likely time transmission. Given apartment (marginally) bigger aircraft width, would stand reason planes dangerous AF too. COVID vaccine required shot eye I'd still first one line. 14k cases per day

more like 17.000 confirmed cases per day. weakly average 14.000 per 600 days current rate. 

you're conting linear significant under-testing 

Not anymore, 40,000+ test day good ""under-testing. Could improved sure far ""significant under-testing"" One day people reject spin double speak, longer tolerating ideas like 2nd 3rd wave holding puppet masters accountable...one day. Crazy idea...eat flight? could even eat after, too! ate decent sized meal, 6 hour flight without eating problem. Even 12 hour flight doable large meal beforehand, 18 hour flight without food cause die unless certain medical conditions. Maybe dumb question, first wave big enough avoid second one? second one inevitable? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article death rate anyone 50 low. fearmongering media removing Trump office.

I won’t lie you, due rushed nature vaccines amount vaccines promising failed, honest say might wait little bit. See causes shit illness side effects, even works.

Kunts? fair it´s mandatory wear masks there. remember AF saying masks early later admitted lying due shortage PPE Healthcare workers stopped trusting him. listen says take grain salt. can't fathom expert field hired protect health public could lie reason. wonder regrets telling us wear damn homemade cotton mask exactly many us did. Number deaths. Exactly. still don´t think happen, RKI keeps saying restaurants bars main reason rise infections, prime ministers don´t wanna close anything, except Bavaria. don’t understand schools open anywhere. thought also R number, less 1 means longer spreading, 1 means spreading. ass-hats people aren’t wearing masks taking responsibility safety. family (in America) saw coming January started preparing then. matter first second wave kills you?

Goooo Sports! surprising, spousal infection rate 20%, husband true asymptomatic risk infected anyone including even lower. Damn. global superpower epidemic research team stationed China prevent exactly that. 

Guess we’ll never know. honestly believed that, would problem lifting restrictions. said 'fake news' drive home OPs point. think accounts difference, additional dangers living third world country?

South Asia, smaller similarly poor region almost 3 times population Latin America though. Fox News social media correct however FDA relies company selling product safety checks talc products - J&amp;J dropped ball tried covering up. Makes sense - thank you! Belgian : hospitals, 30% personnel show work moment. Either sick, tired vacation Spain. 
There enough doctors afford letting others stay home. Failed educational system ... making pandemic worse linger-lasting rest us. Netherlands consider one reasons amount conspiracy karens grew large lack transparency / clearness. (Karens may kind word some)

They'd us reversed. average Canadian spoiled, entitled, elitist would rather double-double give single shit rain forest. Masks supporting evidence. People still don’t wear them.

Well, partly places politicians refuse put meaningful measures.

I think focused actual data presumably got, anti-maskers tend less empathy etc, rather trying tie extreme sociopathy. 2% relatively accurate, yeah. 2% seems small insignificant, think many people is. 350 million people US. 2% population dies end this, that’d 7 million people dead.

When Morgan says “...have time included...” “... every situation...” really sounds like measures since beginning pandemic specific measures asked summer imply.  


In interview answering question specifically number participants public events. seems hard argue limits public gatherings part FoHMs strategy even though within direct jurisdiction. elements strategy directly jurisdiction FoHM advice recommendations authorities. article see scientists conducting study say it. Idk, came thought process, know believe retarded. Good day. Easter 🙄 sigh Social distancing seems plan. leaders failed us. seems like different source says different numbers. list official (not something) seems. newspaper keeping track?

Anyway doesnt matter really, 6, 24 even hundred doesnt change that, currently, according known cases known reinfections. Immunity lasting 8 months anomaly.

British curries brought immigrants Bangladesh adapted local palate. Still good though.

Best admitting countries complex mix cuisines. 

'Traditional British food' generally nice cooked good ingredients- spicy super exciting.. many people picture bad British food comes post-WW2 era. worries. I'm conservation biologist papers virology. I'm doctor means, well within scope expertise - extensive experience dealing aspergillosis outbreaks birds, example. US's new supreme court justice covid summer (something hid outbreak near). Hopefully suffering cognitive issues. study 6 months yes, guess that’s longest know. Obviously countries outbreaks lasted longer 7 months. don’t know published immunity studies. Lack testing- know reinfections. apparently many anecdotal reports- doctors well patients. remember long took info/data virus develop? didn’t even change covid symptom list halfway pandemic. virus around since Dec-that’s barely 10 months. Seeing studies show antibody levels fall roughly 8. 

I claimed possible- certain. 

OP pondered explanation this. Here’s one. still even remotely enough evidence support herd immunity. It’s literally assumption. It’s even implication. proanti, except comes antif_ascists, antianti. Opinions US:

2016 - need everything help 1% !

This trials. waiting. one waiting, they'd begun vaccinating last spring. Brain bones mmmm Aaaw.... Fair game. Looking South Dakota Someone actually downvoted self-awareness. 🤦‍♂️ Take upvote. Airlines dont decide often recycle air. plane built matter flying it. * confirmed reinfection requires positive test first time, positive test second time, samples kept times, two strains different allow confirmation. first two independent 10% average person worldwide. Combining others may, I'd guess, 100,000x reinfections confirmed ones. still tiny number. 

* Anecdotes reinfection everywhere numerous. 25% people could reinfected within timeframe think far common. Keep mind though still exposed twice. estimate 10-20% US caught COVID 2.5-5% eligible reinfection 0.25-1% would actually exposed again. 800,000-3.3m people US. possible?

* reinfection even close severe would see deaths cases decline places herd immunity, like Sao Paolo, Manaus, Delhi. But, least Brazilian cities mortality tracked, deaths spiked dropped back baseline. 

* Antibodies may wane number yet still provide immunity. study linked give distribution antibody titer counts, red flag me. 

* Antibodies may even important cells protective immunity.  Unfortunately cells several orders magnitude expensive study. seems like need breakthrough cell detection advance science them. moment still first wave, yikes Dicknoses everywhere. Good point. Counterpoint: lived experience says ""no LOL thats got infected still don't"" Yep! live Chicago. Talked GF happened kid school, would anything could make sure go germ pool. lucky able work home. definitely felt like giving us ""delayed flight"" treatment. know, airlines continually tell flight delayed another 30min 6 hours flight cancelled? Diagnostically speaking, antisocial personality generally coincides poor impulse control poor risk assessment. See we've delved talking topic hand throwing insults me. Every move made away original topic made tried inch us back towards it. 

But right. I'm one know argue. Look ad hominem, cutie pants. Every day another news article panic people. 

We swedish report found three months everyone antibodies built up. also found real dimished response three months terms antibodies. However cases refined detection system needed find antibodies. actually wasn't. Back Skåne lower levels infection Copenhagen. day five hour long queue formed border Danes coming back holidaying Sweden. imagine, nothing happened this.

Border closures Danish national sport. love finding excuse Reminds weird leadership training course.

You way better. fact personal opinion people worse. 

I'll block now. Can't deal morons like right now. \*Only\* 2%. Would get bus knowing one passengers get alive?

On hand, 2% positive tested cases, many identified testing. oh right, .04 percent..my bad

Either way, bad people making pretty much everything except schools closed, makes think closing schools would make much difference? Looks like valved still higher surgical. I'm annoyed did6 test fitted half full face respirator. I’d like apply grant study wetness water.

How far get groups molecules lose property wetness?  say article virus spread flight? 

It shouldnt surprising anyone asymptomatic people flying around subsequently spreading virus, still believe actual transmission flight rare. Rightwing loonies terrified, reason, octogenarian women

ok, women generally I'm sorry people feel scam beat Trump.

I hope countrymen stay home, can, believe seriousness.

I'm Japan. government lying people serious. anti-social society. Without big parties, can't spread easily. So, I'm lucky way. think hope sickness ends soon. You’re still underwater, doesn’t really matter many waves you. Many countries Europe elsewhere brief moment head water least even dry feet. 

The US still waves, looking graph anyone see that. It’s complicated it’s also bit irrelevant.

It’s likely cares rocket winter months, things going get lot worse.

I currently live spain, numbers fairly awful new restrictions. wear mask accept make changes good all. pretty well fucked time come. Shitty politics don’t really help. 

It baffles got point argue don’t follow sound scientific advice. gone backwards. Fix abortion laws. Problem solved. 1. math sucks.
2. risks getting virus 2% - hard say US average 100k cases next four months, identifying 40% those, that's 10% population infected winter.
3. said, even pre-existing condition, young person probably 2% chance death; older person would though.
4. 2% 2%, it'd 0.04% chance dying. accept gun point

I know people believing wacky conspiracy theories *exist*, somewhere, never quite hit like this. Protest signs containing antivax ridiculous conspiracy theory stuff: example, one reads ""Chip - sign beast; right hand, NEVER"". fuck's sake.

Also, demands. ridiculous one *stop testing*. WTF.

I think generally respects science experts. us going problem. they’re 50 taking immunosuppressant corticosteroids rheumatoid arthritis? they’re 30’s taking chemotherapy cancer? it’s it’s CHILD born cystic fibrosis ?

Oh come Florida isn’t seeing rise didn’t ban wearing masks lol predicted months ago nerds. they're nerds know.

Alphas afraid virus.

/s case obvious. Depends hyper-polarization America continues Republicans generally oppose lockdowns. Yeah, probably right. looks like jump cases last week (yet) seem followed expected exponential daily increase cases.

Let's hide pretend happening. Uhh obviously... straight propaganda dehumanize conscious humans even sick humans.

we KNOW, facial- /surgical masks 0 effect virus based infection spread:

 Face Masks  systematic review, identified 10 RCTs reported estimates effectiveness face masks reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections community literature published 1946–July 27, 2018. **In pooled analysis, found significant reduction influenza transmission use face masks** (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; *I*2 = 30%, p = 0.25) ([Figure also KNOW, face- /surgical masks harmful. includes reduced blood oxygen saturation increased blood co2 levels. dangerous lead death:

 

we even got osha (**Occupational Safety Health Administration**) whistleblowers coming forth insanity harm forcing masks onto broad public:

 

and also already got studies showing MASSIVE psychological psycho-vegetative harm coming forcing facial masks onto public:

 

this garbage article trying demonize people, actually stand everyone also standing children fight slave muzzles, harm 0 good. opinion, scientific fact.

what actually antisocial try attack people, wear masks. anti social also create hit piece try demonize them.

the facts clear every day people waking up.

who still falling propaganda independent? Florida’s numbers accurate, may part problem. Yeah, exactly. tragic around. Yes, stable weeks dry ice, distribution issue developed world. Dry ice dirty cheap. completely reckless selfish.. bribe groom knew guests COVID symptoms proceeded special day anyways.. hope worth assure not. Another take virus started stories patients waiting get seen hospital would spit nurses spite. Similar stories states. call 'spiteful transmission' infected try spread sick around they're ones suffering. Weird stuff captivating human behavior. Average urban hospital bed occupancy rate sits around 63%, give take bit based year. That's awful hopefully recover. prayers him. understand many long term Heath problems this. Agreed,whilst think lot people wear masks relatively selfish reasons idea could ""scientifically proven"" short period time seems absurd me. Oh gator po-boy New Orleans.. I'm saying American food bad all. favourite (Spain/Italy/France win that).

So many stereotypes Americans UK come WW2 GIs living war-torn county great climate growing interesting fruit veg. Modern British cooking world apart.. still different USA. kidding me? need close EVERYTHING least 3 years even consider step houses. gives fuck businesses people's jobs?! Bored tech workers think lockdown easy.

How touch people? Yes. Yes are. Unless know better, would make negligent ignorant. still wish hope infected deadly virus. I'm pretty anti social still wear mask...  Actually urban average hospital bed occupancy rate varies year year, usually 60-65%, although may improved past several years. 
 
So no, wrong. salt tastes salty, study finds. Lies slander! antibodies!  Europe right behind us per capita.  Yeah. Wanting selfishly put others' health lives risk seems pretty anti-social me.

I'm saying I'd wear mask two years everything cool. 

I'll wear mask needed keep people safe.


And seeing half face weirdest anti mask reason I've seen. think together, honestly I'm sure. Ah okay. Yeah mean kinda unavoidable yeah it’s hard convey bleak US right That's tempting idea, want give incentive move there. Build suburban neighborhoods, put sales brochures, offer free one-way transportation luxury liner. 

It would cost money, would profitable investment humanity's future. warm wine melted cheese

Like nacho Sangria. Ouch. I'm Vic Aus 0 state wide two days running. Canada could go aggressive surpression route cared enough. seems like Swedish strategy bit slow follow science. took acknowledge asymptomatic spread (hence nursing home deaths), Sweden starting quarantine family members positive cases (although attack rate highest family settings) Sweden probably country recommendation mask usage. Nah, one alts skeptic shit way back trolling sub scrub. He's trying create target skeptics attack/start circlejerk over.  doubt it, I'm super healthy tho :P Yep. That's exactly situation. Private education like Trump university? Lol complain educated immigrants taking jobs away. 

Also ironic talk sense entitlement realize underprivileged children hit worse lack schools. withstanding fact entitled expect teachers literally die beliefs. 'complaining', using valid rights state valid needs. Given problem beyond public's ability solve, politicians solved hectoring public bit more. Europe's experience proves this. criticism politicians policy response, messaging.

I think told want hear: certain (predominantly conservative) segments American population blame (predominantly liberal) expert class bears responsibility except extent crack public enough. blame game pointless, also touches best way forward: try push public more, demand experts start thinking box? two opposition think emphasis latter. Good you! managed keep US continuous peak high fatalities ever since April. quite astounding. Europe could barely match achievement back spring. second try even close. make 1/3 capacity, since already enforce masks airliner. would raise prices substantially. see it. year packing concerts, sporting events amusement parks people mask wearing norm. still see people masks (you occasionally saw pre-covid too) get back level normalcy even exactly same. 

I'm anti-masker also intend wear one rest life. 2^20 = 1,048,576 rows.

Uh oh... brain hasn’t lost much per decade far, large number decades. Lol think would stand reason, unless apartment crazy expensive HVAC system filtering air? Ah. Got ya.

Yeah, proper mask donning/doffing key. I’m sure get looks drive short distances mask, typically leave stops I’m running multiple errands.

Hopefully mask bind virus particles droplets enough make “pocket masks” useful ways, least cut exhaled virus. I’m masks, think worn, idea propagated wear masks hours day everything would fine silly, science back up.  There's big difference caring, talking outside masks neighbor bit. 

The risk profile activity incredibly low, even separated 6'. wear mask religiously, isolate, on. I'm taking trash curb without mask on, stop say hi neighbor five minutes outside, really risk, IMHO, seeing transfer way. Nah, going away soon. fake news hoax. something. 

Dear Leader told us. worrying preview fight climate change look like.  dont live Ontario really seen damage Ford caused. HATED pretty much everyone right now, totally different summer. fact latest fk one maverick MPPs illegal gathering almost 60 people, masks, distancing instead punishing Ford said kid made mistake. it.
And went lecture everyone else going much shorter gatherings thanskgiving.. Wear gasketed glasses (e.g. motorcyclists) goggles (lab tactical, vent holes). Goggles shown decrease incidence infection 8-16%. There's evidence plain old glasses help - glasses + face shield may help more. Exactly. close friend mine caught early April. practices MMA works every day. doesn’t smoke drink. Didn’t know seven months later fainted. (for first time life) Went doctor see wrong blood clots lungs. He’s 34 years old. Didn’t realize doctor explained symptoms early April. didn’t realize causing much damage. simply told tired going stairs could walk run mile, problem. Doctor said, he’s lucky didn’t get heart. blood thinners year. 

If narcissistic people initially barley symptoms get infected, rude awakening. Except continue wearing mask want. Free will. people want properly socialize interact humans without seeing half person’s face, they’re “extra year two” mask wearing. Especially vaccinated. That's quite stat wrt ischemic strokes. link supporting that? personal experience totally unrepresentative reality. experience points direction. 

IME people wearing mask around tend like narcissist type lot social skills resources. Antisocial solitary type wearing mask religious way.

Yes hundreds better days today, leads sense “tried nothing it’s late” still 2nd inning thing. airline this? also jaywalk eat best part nachos Since day 1 Kanye I've like ""well there's shameless self promoter room"". thing that's changed opinion went White House. system built....based companies short term profit shareholders gains. pandemic human lives damned! okay, US wait another 3-4 weeks take action, starts getting really bad. tradition. thing weakens heart, lungs, lot organs.

Nah, constant effort help encourage unrest.

All’s fair love war, plenty Americans dumb enough fall propaganda, it’s myth Russia uses social media influence useful idiots. I'm sure understand what's happening - New Zealand locked now, free. I'm middle Melbourne going pub Friday, safely. Actually got time work going 5 days row, like people want help economy support hospitality get back. reason safe to.

From understanding places lockdown economically suffering anyway, noone wants go safe, forced lockdown government support affected people. get paid stay home need self isolate. still get paid can't go work lockdown. 

If look rest Aus NZ going last 6 months, virtually lockdowns since original, see sustainable cases low enough. Even Sweden locking bit going herd immunity. Iowa locked economy still fucked. 

It definitely sacrifice, things worth are. need Jesus..

...I heard Stockholm last week bringing back covid victims, go there. There's lot going here, think easily come conclusion. think would see something like march/april number deaths would way bigger now.  


We facing new wave hospitals healthcare professionals prepared deal it, maybe second wave wont letal first. Best luck millions guinea pigs. crap, cannot dense.

Look, would also frustrated ashamed country handled badly Sweden, there's need incivility.

Being critical Sweden's strategy rooting Sweden fail.

And says lockdowns countries mentioned effect?

You need understand countries different Sweden.
They large European countries much higher population much bigger cities.
They different social structures common multiple generations live together lot fewer single person house holds.
They less developed social security net, opportunities home office, on.

In way Sweden island similar NZ considering well Sweden's neighbors handled far.

But still Sweden failed hard compared neighbors usually compare (and also compared world).

Something right. guaranteed 3 waves something, us they're prolongated. vaccine change everything, matter many waves hit us way there. Lol white guys kill people American soil want reason, racists like can't see difference. comment referring part planned employment figure reason hire  ""cooking books"" ... essentially Winston Smith's job 1984, going back changing information past.

Is generally something expect want hear first world country. Positive percentage 1.5%. Raw case numbers really mean much without context.  true.

Apparently planes better air circulation filters many indoor spaces, clearly still risk, shown article. Tell protesters lol

To downvoters . Protesters go suck big fat one . think everyone else lol fuck u losers get house like everyone else mean really! idiot wouldn't. Sweden's decentralized hospital system, advantages certainly optimal crisis pandemic.

Each Sweden's 21 regions responsible health care, regions responsible reporting covid numbers FHM (Sweden's health agency), compiles numbers. happened one region discovered reported 31 deaths counted according FHM's guidelines (probably 30 days passed covid test death date, must've missed first), corrected numbers.

There also parallell statistic made Socialstyrelsen looks death certificates instead. bit reliable, updated quite often (only week). majority US vaccinated.

I fear many get family members vaccinated. they'll see COVID disappear claim victory without vaccine even though survived impacted everyone else got shot. know rural areas homogenous blocs all. wish anything bad people right thing really, last 40 (yes, 40) years, matter live. We're living time absolute mass brainwashing. Turning people enemies other. know whites (I'm white, btw) *hate* people they're black/brown/foreign/refugee, told blame them, even though truth. want easy target hit.

All need death levels get level slightly higher flu we’ll done restrictions. level already deemed acceptable society.  like general population then? helping put brexit context, thank Kind like COVID lol! 😂 irony said deadly communicable airborne diseases. I’m comparing two terms severity cover 3 criteria? Where’s cutoff? world would disagree.

I mean come on, alternative US superpower Russia China filling role, that’s awful thing. Let's hope death rate keeps going down. Hell, maybe people even start wearing masks respecting physical distancing bend curve again. Well, could also ask many extra cases would Sweden find, tested 4-5 times more? Vitamin also requires fat intake well. 

Thank that. turn factoid wife concerned heart. none.  remotely mask mandates *everywhere*. anything eaten daily caloric needs. body can’t use, stores. Humans eaten fat/carbs centuries, recently time scale started seeing issues obesity. 

Before go me, know whole “nutrients/macros” thing. Yes. get it. need balanced diet - need certain nutrients, certain level fats/carbs/proteins really excel physical health. end day - doesn’t matter eat comes weight gain/loss. eat 3000 calories lettuce day, need 2000, going gain weight. 

If need 2000 calories day, eat 1000 calories chocolate, loose weight. Granted, health crap, wont much energy, physique junky. loose weight.

Sir Ma’am, clue talking about. Seems bit excessive idk  older are, likely get seriously ill hospitalized COVID. 

The older are, likely Vitamin deficient.

This little bit spurious connection. One region Poland today 98%positivity rate... Putin smart, KGB agent. reading story, doesn’t sound like conservatives taking stand masks.

As someone lives antimask moron, good luck City level... maaaaaaaaayyybeeeee dire (which doubt). otherwise, no. state afford it. places would think people would want wear mask sick people likely be. God. People stupid. There's people can't take vaccine period. There's people vaccine weirdly never produces immune response (the missing 10% case 90% efficacy). people depend rest country immunized make country incapable supporting community spread COVID. anti-vaxxers fuck whole idea.  Lockdown deniers say lockdowns useless that, lockdown extremists say country opened anything. They're wrong. Lockdowns work, they're meant long term solution obvious reasons.

Once curve flattened cases detectable, mass testing, contact tracing universal mask wearing measures keep curve flattened. European countries failed taking measures. That's they're seeing second wave. also doubt Argentina take measures lockdown.  I'm building utter piece shit, own. one literally admitted bully tries physically prevent people using elevator pay narcissism provides weird fucking superiority complex. 

You bouncer, employed elevator company hoa. dr. Fauci's personal elevator monitor, chosen God. loser god complex gets idea authority.

If physically prevent someone accessing elevator zero authority piece shit. Revaluate life. End discussion. didn’t admit wrong think that’s it’s going play out

I don’t think world would cool living like longer regardless it’s right thing do

It’s going odd transition YMMV comes people deem socially acceptable things. get saying, right think rural communities giant homogenous political bloc, also wish outcome rural folks vote interests wound minority. guyyyyys!! They're heroessss

&amp;#x200B;

/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/s/ess/s/s/s  I’m really never visiting state   Clubs closed since march France curfew isn’t stopping private parties. *known cases Holy fuck assumed much right there.

I'm proponent masking social distancing long needed. want discount struggles people time

I know focused specifically plastic surgery drinking bars I've done neither life hardly make life it.

I'm also quite worried potential boot kick door things keep going like trying avoid politics sub. fda gave guidance wanted EUA far media pressure. Nothing line emergency approvals given.  majority population wanted cautious restriction approach they'd already without government mandate. majority population care wants live lives. Assuming Biden voters support lockdowns quite leap. made mistake. general believe, hard fast rule.

That said, post likely saying likely higher percentage criminals court room, there's that. add stipulation lends assholes, get higher % said asshole. like testing live. test symptoms contact someone Covid. moved open testing aforementioned constraints, % positive tests go up. change total positive cases per capita, tested.

I also agree see someone outside likely asshole. Today walk dog twice stop grocery store get milk daughter. put public, public mean I'm likely asshole. uptick would marginal.

If said people ignore guidelines (masks, wash hands often, social distancing, avoiding groups people indoors, avoiding large groups general etc.) We're likely assholes would 100% correct. Holy crap, cannot dense. reading weirdly obsessed users sub rooting Sweden fail, hailing every country forced lockdown.

Weirdly enough, we're boat now.

Why Frances, Spains, Italys lockdown work? Swedens resurgence cases means Swedens strategy ""failed"" (whatever means middle pandemic), strict lockdowns rest Europe failure?

&amp;#x200B;

Why did'nt France/Spain/Italy like New Zealand? Well, did, work them. almost disease control complicated issue can't carbon-copy measure areas completely different conditions. calling peer reviewed studies propaganda.

then trying focus supposed emotional state distract facts.

then claiming, linking peer reviewed studies false narrative.

the research speaks clearly agree refuse comment actual research comments also refused link even 1 reference.

none working clearly pointing out.

not matters course, research speaks itself. It'd good start simply tax likes Amazon, Apple , Google, Facebook etc way be, instead letting get away basically amounts tax evasion. really want state go around micro managing everybody lives lives individual daily level?

The size police force you’d need would staggering countries going shit handled lot better (some worse course) overall government policy. Like Eastern Asia’s back normal despite higher population density since April everyone understood consequences politicians weren’t encouraging people go maskless drink bleach.

It’s also SIMILAR AIDS ALL. onset AIDS, one knew fucking AIDS didn’t know contracting giving lol. remember living NYC hearing first case thinking oh shit. one else cared, state borders weren’t closed, preventative action taken government people despite KNOWING effects transmission rates COVID. SARS 2000s pandemic team already place, disbanded.. dunno, seems like policy failure people inconsiderate me. Sure, old people getting infected nursing homes prisoners getting COVID unfairly, why’s virus spreading first place? half country can’t stay fuck home meet people. would’ve went immediate lockdown soon knew COVID wearing masks, testing, healthcare weren’t bipartisan issues, would’ve good.

People can’t stay home want see friends don’t wear masks it’s inconvenient absolute dickheads there’s victim blaming there. Like actually inconsiderate shit put family’s roommates’ health risk can’t stay fuck home. Keep mind, I’m talking people need go work survive, I’m talking assholes go bars Saturday maskless. know rest California, county hit hard summer probably one worst country (I remember articles central valley). we've pretty steady. graph interesting. I'm sure what's going on, still see people wearing masks etc, Bakersfield pretty wild town lots young people whatever want.  Biden wins, feeling dumpster fire last year, probably settle would think around May June ‘21, people would feel safe. Current Best Estimate IFR per CDC:

0-19 years: 0.00003%  
20-49 years: 0.0002%  
50-69 years: 0.005%  
70+ years: think restrictions required. Obviously we're good enough

Edit: fucks voting facts CDC: keep laughing. fun games one 0.00003% Trump, three weeks ago: afraid virus, let control life.

Now: Record surge new cases, rationed health care. Yep, third spike first wave. went grocery shopping I'd say 95% shoppers wearing mask, half people masks pulled nose uncovered. gonna Einstein conservation matter

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s even political issue anymore. 

I sense blame starting fall back governments whole, regardless leader/commander chief, puppets power are.

Edit: Global Public Health Crisis aka Pandemic politicized weapon political power gains fueled greed. people social distanced properly, wore masks properly stayed home. no. Immediately following many experts encouraged results data see, comfortable children not, fact, driving transmission, especially school settings,” said Brooke Nichols, infectious disease modeler Boston University School Public Health. True, check Burnham’s song brings point home lyrics as:
A dirt road,
A cold beer,
A blue jeans,
A red pickup,
A rural noun, simple adjective  we'll clearer picture month two get readout data vaccine trials, clarity January see long/bad fall wave gonna get/if starts tapering then. 

March April things really start getting better, although we'll still likely masks distancing spring. 

i'm getting concert tickets early August feeling good that, October totally fine you. might normal tourist experience used things likely closed/canceled. Genuine questions downvoted. base current daily cases adjust population, many countries Europe worse US. two sinking ships. stance word taken vernacular it’s abused decades. someone cognitively/emotionally/otherwise challenged, plenty ways say acceptable way.

For anti-maskers, there’s plenty descriptors actual actions (anti-masker readily available, creative terms like “maskholes” get point across) also plenty historical precedent draw terms, like “rat licker” (from bubonic plague era Middle Ages).

Appreciate apology introspection; everyone Reddit would take step. Thank you!!  Dai, lo sanno pure muri che contagi avvengono sui mezzi di trasporto e non scuola. Bisognava lavorare sui trasporti, non ci si può permettere di chiudere tutto
 Yeah he's working pay rent bills. live separately really close work online tutor could offer help well. 

Apart helping financially, would recommend convince take pandemic seriously? know he's exhausted whole thing lot us still thinks showing symptoms sick. could educate right way? Yeah. destroyed American exceptionalism. Blows mind guys allowed travel states. Australia state borders closed months we’re getting 0 1 new infections wild day moment. 

We also isolate everyone special quarantine hotels two weeks arrival country we’re even allowed leave country without special exemption. didn’t say went knowingly, might’ve gotten test think actually covid went party got results afterwards. went party got test weekend reason came back positive means would’ve positive party. Still reckless article wasn’t clear aware test results party got test party. 

Some guy boyfriends work this, got tested didn’t think positive didn’t symptoms went work next day got results back 🙃🙃 Better treatments alot younger people catching covid recently compared earlier year. younger people getting infected death toll lower. also important note US cases rising dramatically totally fair compare March/Aprils figures due little US testing back March. we're likely getting alot cases back compared official numbers due difficult even get test missed alot cases would epidemiologist know? Dolt 45 says we're ""turning corner"" that's good enough 40% Americans. 🤪 like 80% people Vitamin deficient. Almost one gets enough sun naturally produce enough modern age. also control South America/Mexico, too.  absolutely correct. entire point post bash people wearing mask. label ""selfish"". total bullshit. I’m curious southwest handing it. really stick long time, takes time body synthesize vitamin receptors accommodate increased intake. Long Covid may actually turn Lifetime Covid.

That jumping conclusions. evidence Long Covid persists lifetime, treatments autoimmune may make less likely.

The science gives us one first clear pictures possible mechanism Long Covid, Good News people Long Covid who've told they're imagining symptoms.  today reported 235 nursing home deaths. Worrying. don’t source you’re talking ass

Yes question. provide actual credible backing? less send 7 million students school everyday 5 hours closed space 20 people even wearing mask.

Yes exactly reason hundreds dying everyday issues. Schools. haha yeah read yesterday, part inspiration comment  That's lot cases.  That's true. worse states. 43 states locked down, 24 states lower unemployment rates Florida. would place around 40th percentile lowest unemployment rate.

Bureau Labor - State Unemployment Rates: always good innocent people dying. Fuck. benefit doubt here. Trust me. Agenda extreme special interest. invented University Michigan thought winters yea, it’d awesome couple months year even there. 

In south would probably turn humidity fog, you’d walk around fog blasting face! :) Can't wait see T-cell brigade one well.

Quick review though Memory B-cells ones responsible neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies chemicals responsible sterilizing immunity, immunity people think ""immunity"". T-cells split CD4+ helper T-cells (which responsible activating immune responses) cytotoxic killer CD8+ lymphocytes. CD8+ T-cells attack virus particles like neutralizing antibodies, attack infected cells pumping virions. important T-cells line defense responds already-infected cells, means there's active infection. Neutralizing antibodies prevent infection first place.

So, widely mentioned study SARS-CoV-2 infected patients detectable T-cell immune responses 17 years later contradict headline study UK, mean patients would sterilizing immunity would immune reinfection.

We expect coronavirus, coronaviruses memory B-cells ""forget"" time 12-24 month timeframe people become prone reinfection. seasonal coronavirus sterilizing immunity begins wane 6 months, 12 months 50% people lost immunity 24 months nearly everyone lost immunity. COVID-19 severe disease may produce lasting immune responses people hospitalized.

We expect vaccines produce initially strong B-cell responses similar convalescent ICU patients strong initial sterilizing immunity, expect lost time, experts always stated vaccines SARS-CoV-2 would need yearly booster shots. least T-cell responses produced vaccine, vaccines expected produce B-cell T-cell responses, another reason booster shots necessary. know vaccines produce strong T-cell responses since month data vaccines humans can't say long initial T-cell responses persist.

The CD4+/CD8+ responses virus persist eventually turn disease common cold. prevent reinfection, blunt disease. CD8+ T-cells get jumpstart killing infected cells CD4+ helpers spin immune response start stimulate production B-cells neutralizing antibodies again, course disease look like common cold less like COVID-19.  2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza good example cross-reactive T-cells pre-1957 H1 envelope protein (from 1918 H1N1 pandemic, became seasonal influenza 1957 displaced H2N2) protected older people 2009 H1N1 nowhere near severe. Older people still got infected, still got sick, still could transmit disease, wind hospital/ICU dying thousands.

BUT immunity binary on/off switch there's levels immunity. Sterilizing immunity necessary herd immunity, sterilizing immunity somewhat fleeting virus, get T-cells. stereotyping not. good news. 

This people end heart failure, diabetes, etc., viruses. yeah love wearing mask emotionless fake smile strangers infection rates school population DOUBLE general population data 2 weeks ago.
Considering students asymptomatic understimation real public health hazard schools are. Thats reassuring. Im thinking going universal studios late october, well. add that, think could get clearer picture whole hassle next march, april? course we're callous, hostile, deceitful. We're fighting system that's taking away liberty.

Watch comment get ton downvotes, bots people genuinely think COVID-19 virus that's killing us all, reality not.

The fatality statistics proven hyper-inflated. Why? generate fear. PCR tests highly innacurate. Media talking cases, generate fear.

It's obvious take step back see really is, great big scam. Drugs 90% failure rate. would disagree, fauci stated Vaccine widely available March/April, well summer. summer, everyone vaccinated. We're meantioning huge desert middle? Probably restrictions actually something Lets hope! Deaths per capita almost major EU countries overtaken US now. Last checked, anti-masker protected category, jerk.

That, masks political. IQ test. hire people lack intelligence frankly empathy wear them. Canadian home town, almost smaller private restaurants closed down

Well that's obviously terrible, directly referring **1 hour** restaurants close early really dismissive people seriously affected lockdowns.

Again, directly stating people got upset wear mask. people concerned lockdown issues, able work. Well Australia continent, island, that's really relevant. What's relevant Australia urbanised - urbanised fact UK USA. That's big number.

Deaths rising 50% per week France (7-day rolling average per worldmeters). think means delay testing death dropping - France used 30-day delay (higher better, basically), cases 30 days ago rising 20% per week. Absofuckinglutely. interpretation good news? even good news virus. italy bars restaurants reopened may 18th.
Schools reopened sept 17th 24th.

This enough show driving second wave. someone seated outside eating beer.

In addition brusaferro others admitting finally schools played major role government closing high schools universities? obviously part problem. force 7 million students go school dangerous. Expecially use public transportation rush hours mostly asymptomatic.

So yes italian finally people speaking up. Reopening schools like government huge mistake. RIP economy. equivalent United States hitting following:
 
 
299,000 cases per day 
 
3,636 deaths per day could called Murder. Nah. they're women typically, previously heavily Red-held state. Maryland pretty stringent mask policies earlier states opened 3 phase basis. Hogan never got terrorist plots. But, he's also republican deep democratic state. He's type republican toes Trump line politician matter. really feel different vitamin used bone creation also immune system really means less likely fall break something easily (such osteoporosis), also get ass laid bugs much people deficient (which may case COVID). 

[Some people found anxiety also decreased significantly brought vitamin levels healthy may also link low vitamin skin conditions like vitamin like silent helper ""oh man feel amazing I'm taking vitamin d"". Good good levels of, feel feel negative impact *not* makes sense. absolutely pathetic state like WI cases dense populated neighbor. take way. think downvotes might reflect generalized disgust recent comments Mark Meadows, White House Chief Staff, said they're even trying control spread anymore focussing vaccines therapeutics. animosity aimed karma likely current context anything said. I'm going reign spread, also appreciate vaccine would really nice have. media started concerted effort making approval date issue - NPR, WaPo, NBC/ABC/CBS making story time. FDA put new rule place couple weeks that, rule arbitrary number accomplished pushing approval past Nov 3.

Now, looking memo FDA saying ""we made decision based political pressure"", yeah happen. chain events obvious.

If looking Unfortunately, wrong. 

The people getting sick dying sacrificing people like go Applebee's get haircuts. That's hard truth this. 

It's still hard wear mask. really, really easy. detriment. sacrifice. change anything. majority redditors getting vaccine next summer earliest. college student, wont happening. take advantage subsidized lunches. But, yes, agree completely you. moved week last lockdown eaten inside 3 times since last lockdown ended off-peak times places doors/windows open good breezes. catch eating restaurant people clue personal space. I'm thankful every day. Yeah Pfizer said investigating stored higher temperatures. think they're currently citing handle normal laboratory conditions possible requirements less stringent, know yet taking chances.

Also already said kept normal refrigeration temps 5 days. storage needs cold. point rambling?  New Zealand? not.. give false sense security idiots think work riskier things. face shield alone worse useless. plenty things less crowded movie theatre. got summer without feeling stifled. article today Yahoo Finance, Richard Hughes, managing director vaccines leader Avalere, DC-based health care consultancy weighed legality mandate. Hughes cited political challenge state federal mandate asserts laws provide freedom employers schools require employees students vaccinated. According article, Farley Cleghorn, physician global health practice head consultancy Palladium, “Countries legally mandate vaccination cross borders, yellow fever, schools kindergarten universities legally require vaccination entry, much world expanded program immunization limited medical exemptions....If vaccine developed, employers may able require employees become vaccinated evaluate accommodations religious beliefs and/or disabilities,""

It similar masks mandated now, businesses schools deny entry vaccinated. federal state level dicey issue i'm sure challenged court. place it, y'all. press release sent Monday says volunteer soldiers help operational assistance like mail distribution, laundry, inmate counts delivering meals. Business “friends” yeah, future ventures done without them. Obviously weren’t clear getting points across. explain essentially every single medical (or legal, employment, housing, etc) outcome practically every single type disease ailment worse Black Americans White ones then?

This part trend, COVID specific things.  agree. know September. know late October. know late November. Come already!! movie yesterday, gotta get Russel Crowe well. [B-but governor says 😬 basis claim tell. Made sticky comment link freely-available study question. first time we've problems outlet. Probably subreddit coronavirus? politics/news yea, got foot stand on. would say 

Womp... Womp😑 lockdown week testing. negative ones allowed leave homes, still following measures (mask, distance, hygiene...), big majority attends testing, smaller chance catch it. Im sure first believe seen utah, mass vermont past week so. Conservative Americans love blame foreigners everything. That’s nice Corruption like Latinamerica.. :( accepted likely coming all. slowly stocking things prices temporarily lowered peaks. America's government care. Socialism. Make double, doc! Yup, agree you. parents definitely like Asian Canadian, see ways. pros cons obviously. Yes read article. can’t distinguish asymptomatic presymptomatic first.My feeling home resting anyway.

Belgium terrible position. enough beds, nowhere send patients country asking infected health care workers work. Completely agree without federal support can't happen. Normal people afraid losing everything can't pay bills another lockdown.

That stimulus *really* needs happen shutdown feasible. draconian measures Victoria brought far less compare welding gates China. rare events. Yet one (Australia) brought far less (China). trying make things fair. Go home, nerd. We’re American way. monotonous relationships painful monogamous well can't escape. Made sticky comment. figure appears pulled thin air. concern vaccines need two doses work, work best second given certain point first.

That's good point forgotten, considered. Wendover really good video logistics would work. Something like work open many times day (say 3) plan exactly many vaccines need. places like africa extremely difficult going village village right amount vaccines available . know explanation justice pretty eye opening difficult would vaccinate globally. Whatever. Fuck ""civility"". I've got freedom /s Made sticky comment. Within actual study basis claim whatsoever. top virologist state obvious...  PiS trying kill electorate 😐  plan avoid crowds 2021? seems kind crazy tbh. way takes long get vaccine you’re “major” country. actual study.

1. claim 70% young coronavirus patients one damaged organs four months infection appears nowhere within scope study.
2. Mentions actual figure reference ""COVID-19 deaths among young people comparable due AIDS peak"".
3. Number deaths due COVID-19 age group does, technically exceed number deaths due unintentional opioid overdoses........... *by five cases*. did. Wish spell summon ambulance. 

Level 4? Divine? loved John backyard songs family stay home order. sounded great teachers always get way Chicago. strike drop hat. Nobody ever thought would 0 liberties mean? vast vast vast majority Americans completely doable... crime US hugely regional problem. Small areas major cities inflate averages huge amounts. per capita GDP US citizens TEN FUCKING TIMES higher China 92% citizens health care coverage. 3% higher China quality healthcare pales comparison. highest 5 year cancer survival rate world significant buffer, best medical devices, best medicine available anywhere, shit year we've sent thousands ventilator world year able produce excess never turned single person need one away... LOL, Japan shit. people back office packing bars restaurants months. ""lockdown,"" along government's facade contact tracing, half-assed pantomime.

It's less issue people less inclined towards physical contact Westerners are, importantly, eat far healthier diets much much less likely comorbidities drive chances serious infections death. Certainly due ""leadership,"" something exist here. People care here. mostly go way pretend others exist way government leadership doesn't.

NZ absurd basis comparison innumerable reasons.

Note mentioning countries, mostly Europe, sub lavishing praise months ago everything right, cases started skyrocketing soon restrictions eased. Exactly lockdown skeptics predicted. gap care &amp; education poor parents provide compared rich parents smallest it’s last 30 years. Covid hitting less fortunate people harder rich gap care parents provide widening again. think wishful thinking unfounded soothing refers CDC others downplaying risk, saying thought significant issue, etc. ... notice open fast food drive-thrus closed dining areas... there's real science (so far) know food safe, guesses. thought 3rd reported elsewhere? 2nd? back 1st? 

I dont care anymore. confusing. quit pandemic going back normal life. health ministers conference sweating. Tested positive next day, Feb. 25[Iran minister positive naive expectations US government back then. higher percentage black people get shot white people. Yes looking purely numbers correct adjust appropriate percent population statistically black people shot higher numbers. Faust colleagues examined data released US Centres Disease Control Prevention (CDC) found 2020 number deaths causes among young people end July year quarter higher period last year.
The 14,155 excessive deaths peak rise May, small fraction attributed directly coronavirus.
This implies “the mortality Covid-19 substantially underdetected younger adult population,” said.

Does researcher believe undercounting US covid deaths young adults 100%? certainly think things would imply that. Would nice article bothered link research discussed. didn't. would front page news w even 5% yes TTI, stupid get around that.

It's never late. 

It's amusing see, like said, people fighting masks lockdowns, isolation ways solve simple things like outbreak. problem people wanting single magic silver bullet solve problems, governments communicating clearly possible instead Swiss cheese defense needed, side believe either magic bullet virus real. next battleground vaccines. next year over. here. hate expensive concerts become paid $350 5th row Detroit Dang that's crazy somebody warned us last year distance learning absolute mess

first all, I'm teacher tell mess. Now, *not* replace teaching child room them.

&amp;nbsp;

And yes, difficult help students, especially ones need. 

&amp;nbsp;

Every day, there's new things implemented try reach kids (and kids). quality education distance learning. NOT. make seem one learning ones need extra help completely bottom out...nah. Kids learn. Many lower levels in-school. higher levels (I've really kids completely blast time). stuck. kids barely anything school even less. kids, reach much possible. someone disengaged, reach parents. Set many ways communication possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

At end day, there's much do, in-school distance learning. Trump said, is. **Everyone living pandemic foreseeable future**. effective vaccines 2021, it'll come time decide method sustainable long-term. However, emergency pandemic, think distance learning sustainable year so. I'd give whole school year, depending vaccines medications come out. meds (like one president got) vaccines pass trials super effective, maybe February March start filling back in. takes little longer, Maybe next school year.


&amp;nbsp;

It kids losing situation. fault theirs, parents, teacher, schools, city, country. reality. pandemic. highly infectious virus kills people older, anyone tip top shape, might pre-existing condition like diabetes anything put body 100%. top that, leaves lingering effects possibly years (obviously can't proven yet, damage done scientists doctors already labeling certain effects body take years repair, all). situation.

Government help isn’t coming administration people gotten fed up. It’s “MUH FREEDOMS” thing. It’s human nature thing combined American societal norms. Asians countries quick believe trust government wearing masks years. American citizens are, better worse, different.

Past research attributed income-based inequalities young children’s academic achievement educational attainment part differences home environment; is, differences parents goals drive behavior. However, studies using data parenting behavior parental goals past 30 years, found income-based differences parenting steadily decreasing. instance, since mid-1980s, low income parents greatly increased time they spend enrichment with young children, reading them, telling stories, taking library. And, look parents’ goals children, see complete convergence trends over time, high low income parents today equally likely value children’s ‘thinking themselves’ ‘working hard’ ‘being obedient,’ trait low-income parents consistently rated important higher income parents throughout 20th.

The COVID-19 crisis, economic social restrictions followed it, threaten progress. pandemic exacerbated inequalities families’ economic, health educational resources tax low-income parents’ ability pursue realize goals. Decades research describes the toll taken job loss, income instability, material hardship parent mental health, parent-child interaction, and children’s development and see emerging data pandemic phenomena remain true today.

Our respective research teams following hundreds low-income families young children onset pandemic spring onset. One longitudinal studies 272 predominantly Latinx families elementary school children rural Pennsylvania, 314 predominantly Black Latinx families preschoolers in Chicago. Despite differences demographics, emerging evidence families surveyed April June year shows striking similarities ways three pillars parenting – economic stability, parental mental health, support children’s learning – shaken. rural Pennsylvania, example, found substantial increase share parents worried would run food could afford buy more, parents’ reports daily worry depression increased steadily February May 2020. Chicago, similarly found share families reported struggling make ends meet nearly doubled, 13% 23% last fall spring. surprisingly, parents reported substantial increase levels stress. Disruptions parent-child interaction also apparent: Among parents Pennsylvania, share parents reported losing temper children given day increased 60 percent February May. Chicago, share parents agreed statement “I feel overwhelmed responsibility parent” rose significantly 8.9% last fall 14.3% spring. Stocks almost 30% late March lows. current recession/depression worse 2008 end sight, neither US Europe look like beating Covid time soon, without fixing health issue, economic recovery. reason think stocks high trillions stimulus that's injected prop zombie economy remain dead Covid over. 4 6 months. *long term effects renamed ""unsubstantiated fearmongering""* already revealed guy died placebo? Presumably able check individuals status, wonder might someone gets virus (rather die) got grant run study topic, likely reports surface transmission frozen food packaging. 

i'm sure fuck ""wishful thinking unfounded soothing"" Trump issue executive order allowing fire Fauci disloyalty? timeliness Fauci's statement vaccine going ready soon sounds suspicious now. He's trying keep job. like read it. time moment would love hear thoughts. SCMP's science reporting historically............. lackluster.

Edit add: Including (maybe) intentionally never directly linking sources. According figures worldometer US 230k deaths vs 250k Europe. whole Europe bigger population. North America less populated Europe, ~345k deaths better comparison. Exactly. People criticize giving government power major benefits. government controlling crime drops significantly. need vote Trumps rest fascists out. GOP wants much control lives. need give control people trust like Democrats instead outlaw GOP. Priorities It’s fallacy political appointees jobs reasons competency. Asian countries achieved success level government control would almost laughably implausible freedom-loving USA.

Heck, even Australia protest basic policies social distancing mandatory mask wearing; fortunately small affect response whole. I'm replying guy got 100+ upvotes implying vaccine trial involves checking people get infected. work education truly awful students can't seem find attend school get work done. necessarily parental problem go work child stays home. communicated father (who live son) take away son's Xbox playing class.

It great time students learn self control self motivation, students truly get work done teacher next them, class, nagging front them.

On top that, already push give homework useful metric go home half class (in certain areas).

That said, successful students. takes attend class assignments. get think lol, Fauci's decades many presidents, red blue.

But apparently advocating masks staying safe pandemic immediately politically controversial Thank putting health others comfort. Selflessness seems pretty hard come days. feel second mask much second rubber, I'll say much Holy fuck, time right now? really care people they... work healthcare among first get vaccine. throwing masks away get vaccine. always thought Greg Gary bruh fr, too. Watching people backwards cultures fling poo always funny. [Yeah know gather talking duck sort, quite impressive. Hope swift recovery.  control restrictions. agree want to. Majority allows use app still (most games anyway). read carefully even allows restrict specific things. Like contacts, location etc... - *this android only*, sure iOS Victorian here. Fucken oath.

I live regional Vic shire 1 case ever. still pretty strict lockdown close Melbourne brothers sisters endured.

Our leader backed science refused swayed aggressive conservative media look that, worked!

It looks likely I'll able see family xmas (they live another state) relatively normal summer. business booming fast making losses made lockdown.

Its almost like back start March except know truckload tracing systems place top notch.

Very proud.  vaccines won’t work? world achieved herd immunity, imagine night clubbers make random strangers packed night clubs celebrate end pandemic. Also, COVID Tracking Project’s Hospitalization information:

[Total currently hospitalized broken broken data along OP's article provides compelling alarming picture headed, especially onset winter soon. I’m pretty sure in-person learning going strong Ballard school district. Think tours entertainment. People absolutely miss live music. probably still need precautions like social distancing masks even vaccine distributed vaccine may super effective (like flu shot 60ish percent effective). Aussie here. think underestimating Canadian winter. Even if, say, increase winter spread due people spending time indoors, find Canadians spend winter indoors. Australians, even Victorians Tasmanians, spend time outdoors winter Canadians do. Australian school kids eat lunch sitting ground jumper winter. could kill kid Canada. Surprised GOOD NEWS post wasn’t upvoted sub went movies Friday. Global warming helping greatly well. It’s also something open secret phase III trials going swimmingly.

I wish people understood this! fact world governments placing orders vaccine &amp; trials expanding AMAZING news. They're taking stab dark throw money, multiple first world governments pouring Oxford's (and Moderna's Pfizer's) data really like they're seeing. (french bad English)
School reopen one purpose: allow parents go work again.
Too many small medium business definitely closed.
And partial un-employement aid costly government. forget freedom buy organs stolen critize government pooh bear! I've always wanted visit, I've heard great stories! know geography.

Also, wreck dreams Crocodile Dundee!!!!! Great minds think alike.  athletes signing big contracts go huge battery medical tests contract contingent upon

You require physical can't ask medical history. Professional athletes hired contractual basis based large list disqualifying medical conditions

They get cleared doctor, cases conditions well controlled. doctor certifies employer ask conditions. looks one that's well controlled. cost 1800 bucks each. There's gonna random weekend 2023 traveling Europe I'll arguing sales lady Sephora guy freely strolling bookstore, COVID restrictions randomly pop heads we'll like ""damn nightmare, thank god over"" continue lives. confused, trying put area down. know lot people medicine, none say overwhelmed can’t handle patients. going here? Well that’s fracking wonderful... Thanks. really hope _death_ count dependent amount testing though. Clearly number _cases_ is, deaths usually receive scrutiny. Cant multiple waves onehuge wave *tips head* point distinction first second wave, second wave always way worse.

The point saying still first wave, actually fauci saying "" aint seen nothing yet"" people really scared covid anymore. looking stats (99.6% recovery rate people 30-40) data, anyone reads little probably go back normal life much possible. TTI consequence strategy 1. cant achieve 1 without TTI. implied.  [this count anything ones cost thousands? calling second wave Canada. Why? experience SARS definitely helped. mom front line SARS hit China. vividly remember days stay family job dad's recently travelling home dangerous me. Also hospital started work sort procedures separate patients fever patients. school kids, wear facemasks (the old cotton fabric) report temperature everyday. time covid-19, see (or like hear) adopting nearly 20 year old protocols quickly stuff like mom still fairly fresh memory (and fear) SARS.
Although add many medical workers actually criticising hospitals CDCs reacting prompt enough already experience SARS. happens CDC re-form establish emergency system provide fast detection reaction future. 20%, Covid would gone already. one hour exercise one example honor system. Another ""bubble"" contacts choose. allowed one person bubble. even applies parents. happen know many people following contacts incredibly surprising. video people welding one door, know one several entrances Fauci shown know he's talking about. refused criticize Democratic governors encouraging people go BLM protests summer. listening anymore. Musicians athletes? ask why? Hope guy dies alone shunned loved ones strong enough beat virus like Donnie Fat Fuck I've found one since pandemic started business wore n95 mask take entire flight. international flight meal service offered would no-go. idea 90% Hong Kong cases reported imported cases. makes feel lot better state things HK. understand still getting numbers everyday. wrong, elect leaders elect multifaceted thing think racism major driver politics I'd recommend serious reading hard thinking.

Every time tough crime president essentially promising keep ""scary black people away"". social reform strips social safety nets ok ""those lazy Blacks sponging government."" Hell lot restrictions first amendment specifically keeping Black people protesting 1960s. restrictions weaken individual citizenry give government way much power large segment population ok anything long keeps Black people parity.

And confront we're never going able achieve things like universal healthcare, enriching social infrastructure. finish taxes time get mine

Canada signing online quickly easily. questions asked $1400 dollars month (more family) hoops nothing, completely independent employer. Also better healthcare coming check, important pandemic.


Stimulus packages around world:

UK: 80% workers' salaries

Denmark: 75% workers' salaries

S Korea: 70% workers' salaries

US: One time $1200 check may take months coronavirus epidemic, U.S. average unemployment benefits $378 week, although amount duration actual benefits vary state state. illustration: Mississippi, state lowest unemployment benefits, offered citizens average $213 week, Massachusetts, state highest, provided average $555 CARES Act added $600 week existing state benefits end July, significantly boosting unemployment benefits every state. Americans may waiting receive benefits many states trouble quickly processing hundreds thousands unemployment claims coming international numbers provide insight countries helping soften economic blow newly unemployed workers, quite accurate say American workers simply receiving less international counterparts. full death report year released CDC available next year. reports widely used various statistical models policies, cannot hidden even reshuffling cause death another category. person dies, goes many records SSA, master death index, county courts, paper trail sufficient enough see full impact mortality rate due covid everything else 2020. Good, dumb motherfuckers need die. Die die die old racist fucks Yes Shame it’s affecting Black people much. Hope tide turns racist hicks start dropping like flies. evidence California’s first subsequent lockdown caliber detailed. Movement people relatively constrained. enough tests carried out. Results take long get. Contact tracing untimely mess quarantines comprehensively monitored enforced. Jersey, probably show contract ""sanitation"" company, worry bout it, capice? especially easy run hospital capacity. think cases turn into? It’s repeated pattern - cases, hospitalizations deaths. takes die COVID.

If care hospitalizations, several articles hospitals Utah, Texas, Wisconsin overrun. cases/hospitalizations continue efforts control virus haven’t put place. 

Don’t worry. deaths care about, increasing too. Rand Paul fucking beheaded skull fucked bad didn’t die. Could’ve taken care two dumbass Hicks one fell swoop looks it, political concerns pissing Trump US. would look like one top US allies decide use Chinese vaccine. think make new game

""Dr Fauci says..."" That's step right direction America riots get lockdowns. Think it.. government saying allowed work refuse give money. think gonna happen.. Meanwhile richest people America becoming wealthy. Meanwhile rest us getting poor.  wave trump first wake March? 450,000 per day take consideration current outbreak Czech Republic average 14,500 infections per day country 10.7 millions. real. kept reading thinking someone speaking United States, code. Eerily similar. Fresh declining slowly couple weeks ago. Uh, great question. 

Where hell, go there?

Seriously, believe me. hope it’s mostly dumb motherfuckers Certainly, sir.



Right away, sir. hope dozens lose loved ones. piss graves pandemic negative empathy point significantly reduces death rate, done job. hope one dies. they’ll forgotten cast aside loser deity president they’ve worshiping years seen posts reddit. know much him. surely shitting though context different. I've flown times pandemic treat I'm treating Covid patients. N95+surgical mask+ glasses+ shield personal hand sanitizer second enter airport , second get destination. I'll fly delta jet blue since block middle seat.  wipe surfaces seat well create little barrier air vents. take mask eat drink. fun, I'm used since work EMS.  I'll also get tested landing. “Even harmful”. you’re actively placing lives risk covid death higher risk harmful preventative measures speak of? Right long we’re saving everyone covid doesn’t matter else could possibly die whatever terrible effects may experience right? 7 day average bottom happened 1st week July.  died direct result American government people fucking badly. Yea, since know people won’t that... New York okay. feel like person group project work, discover presentstion day *what mean slides prepared, Arizona Texas? Florida even today??* states Puerto Rico hospitalized covid-19 patients end September, 22 states seen increases excess 50 percent, according health data analyzed Washington Post. Yes Trump said said like meant insult. thought joke first. governor South Dakota, Kristi Noem, said ""We not—and not—be subjects elite class so-called experts."" Scientists doubted alarmingly large portion US. God reading article really reinforces fact good thing Reagan ever die. 

Fuck GOP flight 17% full too

🤦‍♀️ always knew bullshit honor system, we're way selfish that. laws heavy fines place rules, honor system used least important hardest enforce rules like one hour exercise. wearing masks would help. always loved going school friends faculty

I remember school well enough know vast majority middle/high school age kids love going school, to. really think kids actually enjoy getting ungodly hour commuting dark go sit desk day? large proportion students probably thrilled either school virtually right now. choosing focus woman’s reproductive rights instead COVID? America 2.0. WW2 people died fighting facism protect democracy. Something worthwhile. 

You happy hundreds thousands die protecting inconveniences you.

I think look tenents facism, especially Goebbels work publicising it. might see parallels modern day USA. health care workers elderly get it, hospitals less crisis get easier everyone. 
If we, first line workers, get Christmas, would huge thank you. exhausted. Christians one crazy cult? lot Korean Christians, Korean American friends church going. Schools open months much europe. major cause outbreaks would know. That’s opened comments too. 🤣 it'll truly new Roaring Twenties. Spit cereal laughing “poo-cannon” lmao. google ""US coronavirus cases"" look graph comes up, clearly see two peaks followed period declining daily new cases. right we're third period rising cases.

Fauci makes clear he's semantic mainly worried distraction taking covid ""You want call third wave, extended first wave, matter look good news,"" said.  hate United States America burning passion. country ""I would rather watch every person around die told anyone."" Oh trust me, tourism industry suffering heavily New Zealand. without sacrifice. Also, phase III matter waiting certain percentage trial subjects get infected, that's going LOT faster disease that's causing million *recorded* cases every three days worldwide (or every two days now? Looks like we're approaching half million recorded cases day). Well say kids aren’t dying dude. Try without fear mongering bubble boyfriend. asthma body stupid, he’s overweight. would rather overly cautious regretful. He's mistaken PA require quarantine California since lead covid-19 state count. become part people's identity, fervent denial. 

I stop reading threads people start making outlandish claims whether Fauci, masks, flu, etc. going random tangents. discussion someone earlier experimental treatments, used youtube link research back claim. Ummm, yeah no. spiked June/July declined, skyrocketed even higher first spike mid-September school started back up. last week super fun!  proud America, think vast majority fucking idiots, proud American proud Americans, even good ones. Love y'all think way. fucking important cling humanity times like this.

It's easy fall thinking us vs them, protect no1 first. still think realize 

People understand subject well do, disagree you. say curb good. curbed well enough reasonable conversation distinct waves. talk shit US government much want one come snatch jail? Again, weather matter much directly, matter cold Canada virus mostly transmitted indoors whether 7 degrees -15 people spend time indoors together. COVID?!  COVID-19 prevention Idaho joke. population armed unhinged places say anything restrictions. Stage 3 mean anything going get worse here. Sad watch. need go back school. could literally mean America idiots idiot set empty. 

The meaning America idiots, I'm aware studies back up. think lockdown necessary regardless. Every country anything resembling effective response lockdown, exception Korea, unique infrastructure handle this.  Jesus, go hug friends. It’s bad it’s damn apocalypse. You’re gonna die walking street Yeah easy make statement like Reddit Americans lazy, obnoxious, pieces shit guns IQ. hope saying karma Americans nice people, like rest us. think simply born America means even newborn, can't good person?

What's worse guy actual common sense downvoted, summed point perfectly without long-ass rant  Jesus fuck ""But want to, can't tell to."" - Americans Proper r/ELI5 right here. Fuck them. I’m peaceful, provocative and/or disruptive protests (and participated plenty), directly threatens safety individuals communities, piss right off.  Ah yes, gotta love regional variations ""birds n' bees"" talks dad... spelled extrovert wrong. Googled, many people died Flu last year. LITERALLY first result showed NYC alone 80,000 people died 2017.

Where get figure [per _CDC estimates influenza associated 45 million illnesses, 21 million medical visits, 810,000 hospitalizations, 61,000 deaths 2017–2018 influenza season. burden higher season since 2009 pandemic serves reminder severe seasonal influenza be._

Can least provide link talking about? honestly think politicians trying ease us concept lockdowns. told us country would shut ~2 years back March, can’t even imagine badly would received Plus people stepped volunteered trials, especially phase trials. remember seeing picture one first volunteers get vaccine candidate feeling hopeful proud. There's much darkness this, many failings species writ large inability deal well could have, sheer human effort, courage, ingenuity display fighting really something hope future generations look back important moment science medicine. Well reddit told bad sniffles. Sounds like good news get faster bother saying pee contains *chemicals*?! I'm natural, baby! late enough? Waiting week long may mean close everything order effect keep L3 much longer. Well they're obese people world average. Studies shown Sweden, took US approach, hit economy Euro countries does.

It turns people scared getting life-long disabilities dying novel disease, go spend much money regardless government inaction. think forgot /s end rant. Which, incidentally, named one Victoria. know less testing means less corona, said president himself! Maybe quotations finger pointing unsubstantiated claims, powerful enough speak behalf entire country 130+ million people narcissistically attempting. I'm basing multiple reports overall factors look proving true time. Lock downs work cut virus immediately. US currently poor situation lockdowns make impact, past chapter unless healthcare systems dire situations. Healthy habits help think vast majority Americans sudden become Japan level healthy winter months? No, keys discipline habits regular mask wearing social distancing regularly. Although live there, social media news pictures/videos new day age technology. Compare America Japan see children able wear masks properly adults US. Contact tracing also long gone, hope left country based ability wear piece fabric face fucking minutes save elderly 1/3 Americans co-morbidities. Stop projecting attempt helpful. Smug attitude blind unity. I've watched political statements leaders country although I'm sure problems, see grown man cry one death beg citizens part nothing happened even I've watched 7 months. American leaders saying ""everything fine"" part instead exercising intelligent caution. want get back normal quickly, drunk driving sober faster. - were. say ""governments"" much ""some/many guvernments"". governments took seriously populations benefitted. Atlantic Canada we've back normal basically since May/June, exception wear mask indoors. Last spring Connecticut, gov. Lamont said 130,000 students log distance learning. Parents work, kids home themselves. kids educations destroyed pandemic. recover missing is, point, nearly year school? It’s actually bad comparison. *don’t* know total number infected, like example don’t know number total drunk driving incidents per year go unreported. mentioned total deaths per population, compared another cause death per population. Neither tell clear story.

The point I’m trying make bad ought taken seriously. Moving goalposts cherry picking meaningless stats helpful meaningful discussions it.

But anyway, yes, IFR, CFR, positivity rate, hospitalization rate, metrics play within demographics useful capacity. BC done relatively well, go shit quickly. 

What's interesting driven big cities much think. Every time Trump rally, there's Sturgis festival, like gigantic ham planet cannonballing pool directly center poop cloud. don’t blame you, vaccines super important something fucked around with. want take even slightly smells political tool instead bonafide vaccine . trump dolls hesitant , multiple reputable sources recommend gladly take vaccine. sure we’re even halfway done first Fake news brother. sniffles right? 3-4 weeks lockdown early without whining economy masks political statement, would back semi-normal.

Why Argentina back normal then? locked early never got control, suggest worked small countries land borders, (with exceptions like uruguay) That’s I’ve saying months It’s called ‘Tsunami’, Tony. Stay lane let surfers explain shit. Fucken ‘experts’. course are. swear I've never seen level absolute sheer stupidity general public 43 years life planet. see many people daily basis without care world, masks, social distancing (btw live FloriDUH), young teens elderly. like morons trying absolute best make sure thing sticks around long possible. completely infuriating. Sad explain to, be, functional adults.  What, never heard sit up? push up? running place? jumping jacks? Surely device posted also YouTube access - countless legions histrionic narcissists would delighted educate us proper positioning squat thrust, lift couch proper gains. giving easily relatable example comedic effect, I'm sure well aware. screw Kathryn  best spreading everyone know love. Really sniffles I'd take 78 years old Biden heartbeat. idea idiot like Trump got elected first place. I'm still baffled 4 years. No! need spend 24B$ today! ever gonna save EcOnOmY delays Hospitalizations reflect going significance community. Positivity numbers mixed pcr testing antibody testing. genuine slight increase number hospitalizations current growth .88%. Texas Medical Center admissions numbers trustworthy. soon hospitals consistently capacity, could theoretically happen without vaccine via herd immunity. place MASSIVE. Got chance check conference year, wow. Shiii Seeing family friends able travel 3 miles away house important you? content live rest life Zoom? Honestly Poorly worded. mean United States pool fulfills [Olympic standard tried type olympic-sized, preferred term, spell check wanted Olympics. Yeah, listen Noem blind followers. China months full lockdown. Can't say students parents, certainly pleasant teachers. friends family members who're school teachers professors. told effective offline learning certainly much work course instructors switch systems. exactly incivil said??? 


&amp; political discussion????? Better remove original comment too



I realize I’m talking bot come man lol guys better position us, Dallas us 14.4% refuses anything. Honestly keep seeing anti-maskers city cropping up. think we're long haul, guys! evidence far conclusive, much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis. School reopenings much work progress. Still, many experts encouraged results date.

Also, one cares 1 redditor(myself) thinks here. I'm spreading misinformation all. common sense here. Large gatherings people shown spread virus. schools different? 2 months since opened too. Give time see outbreaks.

My state PA multiple school closings already due covid-19 outbreaks. sure hope so! CNA, asthma work immunosuppressed patients. first line start vaccination. MUH FREEDOMS BROTHER dead.

Repeating number mean anything, make look smart knowledgeable this. makes look like fool think majority country wearing masks.

* [Here Pew August **85% Americans** reported regularly wearing mask face covering stores businesses, including 92% Democrats 76% Republicans.
* recent [USC mask wearing behavior **91% recent weeks**.
* [This NatGeo October 5 writes: ""Despite noisy no-mask protests, **92 percent 2,200 Americans polled say wear face mask leaving home**, **74 percent saying “always” do**.

One us listens data. makes baseless, sensationalist claims. tell fool is. top comments thread saying stupid shit like flu seasonal. never changing. Many islands nations done great jobs. they're islands. make every nation every state island, problem solved! Good guys. much lock it? Schools told hide cases. Basically tell people quarantine come back 10 days later/14 high end. However, people test results low numbers. 

Not mention parents actively hiding kids symptoms hopes kid scores well SAT/ACT well extra curriculars enough get scholarship. guys new wave every morning people get bed.

Canada 2nd wave now. worse first far. lot covid frustrated people started negligent now. Slavery freedom. Scomo also actively harmful especially environmental matters. fake news. everyong knows DOH owned libtards Obama deep state lizard people sex eats babies /s That’s funny ! moron people want another four years seems think it’s . scary times . Clocks changing too, less vit D. Hard false every republican. one I’m mask mandate family also. Yeah conservative hate high reddit don’t dick. quit senate first-in-line! Move ND, I’m one things. Simply: covid still existed since came America, still first wave. Places like New Zealand, probably ones allowed say there's next wave idiots charge running country. saw it. Thank you. Who?

and care her? Maybe money left pay businesses second time. stimulus, Trump McConnell got someone three years experience judge confirmed Supreme Court Justice.

So... There's that, guess THANK YOU!! look up! barely taught geography, let alone countries. teach 50 states. 🙄 turning rant. 

We thing social media people Canada thinking we're losing freedoms fascist communists taking over, hard. Even version Trump told people stay home would rather listen Trump gang rather politicians.

Fucksake, work government. competent enough organize hoax. can't idiots create deep state level actions.

Anyway, we're bending political pressure government workers asked return office. We're taking transit, visiting others, cramming offices. numbers keep going keep opening things up. also supposed limit gatherings 6 people.

We working home fine show we're offices proved working. wrote policies 2 brand new laws 6 months year. work I've done 3 years. due home focus working research. none accounts damaging racism souls spirits people. Trump would elected people mad President Obama largely driven racism. hand washing, seat belts, helmets, vaccinations, car seats, etc.... required law? never proper leadership, ever? No. monsoon. also winter summer. Rainy season distinct season India.

Roughly summer March June. Monsoon June September. Winter November February.

We short spring fall seasons call that. forget protests riots Oh trust me. couple years later back square one. Well fair, teach 50 states. That's reason know them. 😂 remember Trying learn Canada's, deciding worth it. capitals, never taught Capitals, decided important things school teach me. Get anger translator like Obama had. Follow science... even fit narrative.. celebrating everyone’s birthday. One big day. proper leadership need enforcement. important, also, permanent. yet Zoom. phone, drop baked goods people love/can, hung (outside, masked, socially distant), still work outside home part time, take drives, etc. failure lock 2 weeks (in area) meaningful way part reason many people dead. okay that? far happen 😂 That’s there’s vaccine yet, people willing wait one. We’ve known since around May/June vaccine way out. can’t suddenly say “nah, still even vaccine” expect people still comply. People miss packed festivals, concerts, sporting events, etc. know, things actually make life worth living.

Masking distancing sustainable lifestyle people need stop pretending is. Ayn Rand. easier Australia? state borders closed months. baseball game we're longest first inning ever.  think entire world lying pandemic order hurt reputation US president? incredibly self centered. axe! response pandemic, gov decided forbid gatherings (sounds reasonable, wait it...) change existing abortion law way restrictive. yeah, ppl protesting, good reason. 

And numbers keep climbing. 

Stay safe &lt;3 thank everyone protesting! dont think sane person issue. live america fwiw, im hesitant getting vaccine soon comes dont trust trump. 

I wouldnt surprised pushes something totally safe. antivaxxer, every shot. dont trust guy believe hed push something sake optics 

That said, fauci approves, id lot less hesitant

ETA: obviously, isnt one making vaccine one appoints leader fda etc Oh no!



Anyway. There's inoculation cure. wear mask, least indoors, wash/sanitize hands, take vitamin D, get flu shot distance others. 

*Try stay alive vaccine arrives.* Let’s herd mentality round turn Seriously great job SK. presumed contact tracing ? St. Fauci (praise upon him) never wrong. job really draining, feel like need time away it, people interact with. getting it. mods get reports within 24 hours, absolutely good enough they're paid. (Nothing) right, serious. 😂 American school system garbage. taught mom internet. mom busy teaching important things school get geography. 😅 Ignorant memes dumb fucks never able sort out. Thanks taking time explain already replied branched thread. Check answer there. mitigation efforts still keep propogating uncontrolled community. Unless Trump says Democratic hoax lost election, we're fucked. Also compared countries. America huge. states size countries, don’t quarantine socially distance all. also states size countries almost completely shut down.

How many people protesting dying? I'm turning right wrong, Left vs Right, Republican vs Democrat thing, virus really dangerous claim, protesting allowed? I'm talking rioting Police force reacting, I'm talking actual peaceful protests. allowed? virus dangerous spreads like wildfire, protesting allowed all? BL really M, thing say? mattered would stop prevent ""large gatherings"" right? 

I heartless say 200k+ people died acceptable loss, issue less 3% contracted virus actually died worldwide, yet encourage allow protests blame certain people white house virus control. 

The Governor's allow states city's host large gatherings call riots call peaceful protests states also dealing increased numbers cases. California example. LA showed shots protests major streets flooded sea people protesting, currently accumulatively not, sure which, 914,000 cases Governor California trying tell people can't gather holidays. government problem protests, turkey dinner family not? 

One last thing urge consider. virus actually severe led believe, hearing extermination homeless population. absolute first effected virus?

Since collective nation decide protesting streets important working supporting families?  think correctly expressed saying Venn diagram idiots Americans, circle Americans nearly eclipsed. absolutely semantics, waves surges [not Urghh bull them.

Yes great lock ur pop, enforce them, great alternatives one cant achieve via testing social distancing. follow social distancing bet numbers ain't bad globally speaking.

Edit: social distancing one reasons economy still functioning, cant believe npr put . people need drowned. Extra stimulus cheques businesses self enforce. randomized anonymous audits. I’d make argument may help avoid touching face, better nothing all. want good laugh? Read comments lack mention TTI, bunch people circlejerk around whether locking good idea. mean leading infectious disease expert global pandemic? Oof, really hoped Move Canada Dr Fauci since fired. use expertise. dead serious. 

I want required take geography. needed credits places, even though straight student. kept expecting taught history, never was! Never time learn own, study time filled useless things.

My mom taught know, never focused geology busy trying teach things school never taught me. 😕  could possibly go wrong creating financial incentive people contract deadly infectious disease. Fauci desperately trying stay relevant.  Wow Brody looking wave Yeah opinion. It’s simple formula, r0 1? Imo, masks acheive that. would masks alone policy anyway? Oh no, someone demanding back claims!!! *Clearly* they're narcissist! talking ass can't support yourself.

Your link five months date essentially puff piece leaning heavily Abe (please) government advisor obviously wants tout low numbers signs suggested policy course worked. clearly didn't. had, Japan gone double-digit cases article published shy [2,000 summer.

They contain shit. article bears I've saying along:

*Meanwhile, government never made testing priority became countries. Japan conducted 2.2 tests per 1000 people. comparison, rate neighboring South Korea 16; United States, 43.*

Nor [changed time:

*But highly bureaucratic approval process means Japan one lowest testing regimes among major economies, carrying 14 tests per 1,000 people, compared 36 South Korea 246 United States.*

*Patients wanting tested must go telephone consultations, demonstrate symptoms show touch infected person. Health ministry authorities must approve test cases refused authorize them.*

The government keeping numbers artificially low discouraging testing. Given hospitals overloaded even Western countries rampant spread, better overall health Japanese people makes even less likely. That's that's going here. Mate. persistence, living island got us this. started masks please-stay-home, reducing size increase, soooo slowly. end lockdown pain worth it. unruly neighbours....Ours Kiwis, body water away. covid. science equivocal. /s Thank alot, autoimmune disease, yet hope affect much.. Good post Simple: agree mass protesting either, context pandemic. However, protests cause bad outbreaks participants wear masks physically distance, unlike gatherings different political nature, practice prevention measures. Protesting people wear masks distance much lower risk smaller gathering without measures all.

Homeless people getting infected. Depending are, differences handling homeless people tracking infections. example, Ecuador months ago, people already dying streets virus control. happen. Agreed. Also thought second wave time related well. Like summer get hit rise. It’s semantics it’s awareness. people understand lack mask-weeding actually makes everyone’s lives worse, better. turns domestic tourism Australians can't travel overseas made absent foreign tourists.  We're tourism boom. 

Wouldn't work poor nations though. Yet people already revolting, despite impression people saying April they'd revolting now. Strange. suppose we're resilient think. Wow crazy! CDC come say 6 feet magic number? kid 6.5 feet away? ventilation system? hope great ppe. Thanks teacher. Take care 5 paragraphs ""strategies"" single mention TTI

Lmfao  Vote serve putin dick Vote make sure everyone know votes, too. Everyone. Old cretins mud. move  really like blowhard idiot, might also like caring kill neighbor's grandma. Hm...Checks out. shit, morons smart enough realize covid hoax thought first wave.....

Then set morons still think fake

Tldr: many morons You’re idiot actually patient without family's consent? that's extremely scary true. I'm talking patient signed DNR order for. I've exhibiting long-lasting symptoms potentially covid related 3 months. got antibody test provider suggested probably show long since initial symptoms. true? read Mayo Clinic CDC's page antibody test say take 1-3 weeks antibodies show test, really specifically long *won't* show test. Well, Mayo say ""Antibodies may detected blood several weeks recover COVID-19."". *several* sort vague, 3 weeks? 6 weeks? More? precise information I'm missing?

*edit*: found input topic healthcare provider's network portal--**Can results change time?**
Yes, tested blood early, process body learning make antibody, could test negative. takes 6 weeks bodies learn make antibody. know long positive antibodies stay similar antibodies typically remain body years. Except billionaires. America diarrhea filled wave pool. becoming obvious every passing day. 

At rate US going, I'm sure ever fully eradicate this. I'm even sure get things manageable levels today's resistance mask tomorrow's resistance vaccine. got told yesterday handing tickets mask wearing better use law enforcement things like human trafficking, get it. 2020 taught us anything, it’s ignore house burning around us mock run call fire department. also false overstating truth T-cells. effectiveness immunological mechanisms referring dependent body's individual immune system. Older individuals may greater risk immune responses less adaptive, fits empirical evidence people think he's trying take away freedom rights capitalist economy. mention nutjobs follow Trump think he's enemy USA. 

The guy trying keep everyone healthy people want take vaccine instantly get labeled demonized ""anti-vaxxers""? necessarily. Depending person's immune response immune system, challenged infection (and therefore test positive) spread via sterilizing immunity. Nope, thought link may relevant. can't speak foreigners I'm cackling glee secret lair right second! defensive gaps identify strike... Downvoted paywall actual sociopath? makes see comment someone excited things return normal, decide mock it? 

I genuinely understand people like seem side virus. Plague Inc, buddy. real life, going leave Mom's basement eventually. *Ohhh*, realize lived experience entire time ""personal opinion."" Clearly, completely unsourced totally unsubstantiated claims Japan's superlative leadership socially ingrained compassion hold weight. Thanks setting straight, bud. really. already far better comparisons - county county. Masks work. *do* studies proving help prevent spread. Helembad simply Well look chart clearly see three distinct waves. least normal definition wave looks like.

It’s waves growing magnitude.

Furthermore separate distinct events: wave 1 comes measures place. lockdown cases drop two months. Wave 2 - open places locked places minimal lockdowns outbreaks. mask mandates basically everywhere cases drop month two, it’s cold people aren’t compliant seeing spikes third time....

Welcome wave 3 said people, slow waves down, please. That's funny. searched thing, went CDC website, got following numbers US influenza deaths:

2018-2019 season: 34,200 season: 61,000 season: 38,000 season: 23,000 that, Mr. liar? Thank you. And, quote source. even know Analogy Project. (I seem dimly recall another one along lines animals different.) FDA delay month reviewing one unexplained illness countries swiftly moved forward... 17th worst measure. Cases, positivity rate? measure worst? want get that, likely true. proper shutdown careful reopening would mitigated massive amount cases rolling around now, likely low unemployment rate strong economy kids probably even school in-person learning little concern everyone's well being. Go back r/nonewnormal friend.  Oh Zeus came mountaintop enlighten us again.. really gives fuck wave, wave spike whatever? cares? Contact tracing fascist garbage

Never gonna happen America, full stop fire burnt building ashes Easter, fire go away own! Almost magic! live near baltimore maryland, dont know ever heard anyone ever covid. recently hospital speaking old jamaican nurse lady, literally told "" yea covid patients here, ship southern MD, covid baltimore, farce"" I'm sure think anymore. wave moves. wave peak one location given time, later peak another place. That's waves work. 

If look infection rates state, see state one peak. wave, peaking different states different times.  teachers/musicians/athletes. thought struggling incompetence florida. Whats going there? point everyone seems missing every argument opening schools arguments BASIC LIVABLE WAGE EVERYONE. That's comes to.

What giving kids quality education? proper social development? identifying cases abuse? Surges yes, nowhere near cases per capita US has.

If competent leader, would much less concern. want blame Trump completely, actions (or moreso inactions) help situation much. cases, places high confidence government (that implemented reasonable containment plans) fared better this. Wow, nice catch. even notice that. Schools even included this. hell there? ""But we've beaten 18 covids""---Kellyanne Conway, probably. know her. might many reasons they're overly cautious. Haha afraid time Americans I'll happy kids go back school, won't. can't stand school would love home school out. I'll take scientists think should. first go need most, though, front-line health workers, immunocompromised, elderly. 🤣🤣🤣who ever said third wave wrong. Like hello first wave never came it’s obvious we’re still first wave!!!!!! everything. Rewatched movie Outbreak, deadly virus. military took control put infected ppl camp, gonna kill all. COVID-19 deadly enough. ""Using poo cannon propulsion"" Trump campaign nutshell. agree completely. dont know political discourse past hundred years separated individualism collectivism. Unless literally living middle nowhere yourself, part group people. ability excel individual talents valued, exchange talents people's talents. ever encounter second wave never make first wave. Big brain time years experience public health Fauci has, agree one.

I 0 years, 0 seconds matter, experience anything medical lol winners here. I’m really political blame game don’t see pro aspect argument. can’t groups work together get children teachers back classrooms safely? Let’s stop childish bickering side side. It’s ridiculous. sides it, people like independent.

And statistics death age groups school campuses? don’t states try specific strategy? student teacher group don’t want come back, continue online. student teacher likely safe want go person, go person. need sustainable plan limiting everyone like we’ve past seven months isn’t working. statistics saying risk protect them? Limiting everything, including education young people need world education important advance society, answer. You’re saying need balance, there’s balance argument.

We don’t know vaccine treatments available. they’ll even come all, though believe will. excuse let people fall behind, I’m talking education. economically, mentally, etc. You’re telling people wait things get better (if ever will) privilege that. everyone shares privilege you. Sounds effective. Trump said week ago everyone ripping apart Many good vaccine news lately. poetic, poetic !! Europeans ruining planet usual naah. crowd source Can't second wave first never ends  death cases always 2 weeks behind infection rate Experts know almost exactly need act. Trump fucking moron refuses take seriously. better mask squad. We’ll need evidence vaccine effective ages 65+ arent even close US numbers. 52k cases France equivalent 263k cases US adjusted population differences

Can read? ❄️ compare doubling condoms? 420th weed

Nice Yes. You’re right. good graphic explaining basic concepts creative way.  Please keep going thoughts pandemic stop everyone agreed meet one two people time. hilarious. 

Have ever heard office, school, funeral, factory, shop, homeless shelter, gym, hotel, repair shop, science lab, bus, dating, food processing plant, house cleaning, hospital surgery? imagine would happen society economy stopped social interactions? medical training ""don't explode lung"", ""get sheet dead tree"".

On first aid training, started blowing air doll massaging heart, almost destroyed it. Real humans much delicate, think might crushed ribs, heart spine. talking somewhat healthy unconscious people, corona cases. many 100's people saved day, treatment hospitals. ones dying soon hospitals overwhelmed. 

COVID patients, car accident victims, complications labour government enforced births; capacity people die, regardless age. Lol data back claim fox news talking points? actually read? can’t get second wave never get first. *taps temple* can't close pool. We're much better getting poo-water ignoring stench. We've never closed pool before, knows happen. fair, think many assholes got us would harm good. yoy wear 30% mask covered. lucky enough kid couple buddies parents would everyone lot. want getting trouble. lot great times. necessarily correlation state's response state's outcome (so far) states like New York Connecticut great responses also high death rates high rates infection. doubt change events studied decades. numbers absolute joke post, implying well. Indian healthcare system terrible begin killed it. least 10 people died covid India many struggled find hospital help. people financially well off. family Gujarat, Mumbai Bangalore. lost shit got percolating diarrhoea part. guy WWI’s 3-4 week lockdown possibly even necessary U.S. Pandemic early warning response programs cut current president. care voters think science public health. Christ fucking live following coronavirus really closely never seen footage like described, remain skeptical much misinformation going on, google search, find anything, reference video?

Edit:
Accidentally, found this, video falsely claims show bodies virus victims waiting picked referring to?  Oh talking original rugged individualism. kind absolute ownership behavior. working shape world betterment life. 

Nowadays boiled ""I dont give single fuck anyone long needs met. taking care needs met? know dont care come top."" good article summarizes recent research. Thanks posting OP. Gonna skyrocket cases arent tied known infections - 150 kids UNE tested etc. likely need mask. Nobody knows sure thougj. Seems like every day there’s new case amongst
Arkansas lawmakers. trying play smart act condescending internet probably corniest shit ive ever seen I’ll ask again: decline compare decline viruses? Take pants. Lulz hell would someone want that?

So better isolate infectious ones. Right now, lot countries given proper isolation controls tell stay 10-14 days home without bothering much, that's way many positives isolate. imagine instead concentrated isolating superspreaders proper expense less infectious people isolated hard. agree, know they’ll make bullshit. parents forge medical records, vaccine records, medical paperwork literally time every school I’ve worked at. 

But gladly get Covid vaccine keep proof. want able travel Canada. Guys line work saved mom’s life two years ago. Emergency transport rural hospital city minutes. made difference get treatment needed.

I figured wouldn’t mind hearing success story every work appreciated. connected http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa288

Blatantly  makeshift hospitals deaths waiting room in: Death starvation bad business. 11. Tried, tried, tried. level hand-in-sand-edness high. topic comparisons, unfortunate situation real world complicated, comparisons done laymen always matter comparing apples oranges.

Ahahahahaha. say comparisons done laymen? understand top scientists world making comparisons, right? Everyone trying understand works doesn’t, Scandinavia literally best example world comparable countries. Literally Sweden Norway perfect candidates different strategies outcomes. side have... you. Saying “I don’t think comparing apples apples”. evidence. data. articles supporting point. even talking point Swedish state paper. Just... nothing. collapse, mean. sent sources, show example mine. field hospital built accommodate corona patients, never needed later demolished numbers improved. mean, know it. Here’s evidence. look forward providing links saying evidence wrong. can’t that, well you’ve lost. ""They try save lives. scared intensive care units would overwhelmed take care young people,” says Anders Vahlne, professor virology Karolinska Institute. “And selecting [patients], bit harshly ""They told us send anyone hospital, even may 65 many years live. told send in,"" says Latifa Löfvenberg, nurse worked several care homes around Gävle, north Stockholm, beginning Healthcare staff Stockholm previously warned unclear guidelines patients needing intensive care receiving despite still several hospital beds available region.

There’s doubt Swedish government let people die received care would easily lived, one cause ten times higher death rate. course suffered, crash. export-oriented economy always suffer times crisis collapse prevented. was.

Wrong. It’s funny want assert things absolutely without comparison anywhere else. “Crashing” scientific term, can’t subjectively say “Well don’t want crash, wasn’t”. economy suffered much rest Scandinavia. That’s data point matters unless you’re fucking mongrel. think comparison valid, not. difficult understand?

I know don’t think. Unfortunately you, **your opinion absolutely irrelevant**. keep surprising though - actually think opinion form value? actually think I’ll go “Oh well doesn’t think it’s valid, guess argument isn’t true”? Here’s trick - scientists everywhere world consider Scandinavia best possible comparison, especially exact case. understand? **Do realize “Well don’t think so” counter argument want criticise Sweden use actual figures, ~6000 deaths. last months around 2 day average. Majority deaths 80+, less thousand total 70.

No dimwit. comparing countries, use per capita rates. Otherwise would ever look China, Russia US. Sweden 12th worst outcome world. absolute terms, 5400 people died needlessly. said, “We extremely concerned Swedish model may given credence,” said. “We believe ineffective. Sweden enormous amount deaths per head population, 5880 deaths representing 581 deaths per million population. Compared neighbours unsuccessful preventing deaths—Finland, example, 343 deaths, equals 62 deaths per million population.”

Please explain ten times higher per capita death rate Norway Finland failure. also help many stories media people died pre existing conditions, really old, super morbidly obese. Healthy people read articles think COVID going hurt them. media sold public idea perfectly healthy people lose battle COVID. also hard keep social distancing many people give fuck health. frustrating go millions able bodied take care health. forget surveys US indicated around 1/3 population refuse take vaccine, matter what. turn named Lord Melbourne, British Prime Minister 1830s, got title town Melbourne Derby, whose name originally ""Milleburn"" Anglo-Saxon ""mill stream"". get negative covid test flying 72, hours prior flight. false-positive tests costs, particularly vital employee (doctor, ambulance staff, air-traffic controller - whatever) ends staying home unnecessarily two weeks. makes perfect sense consider appropriate balance risk false positives risk false negatives, adjust appropriate.

This critical people realise, example Belgium telling positive doctors keep working many isolation. Imagine instead this, concentrate improving sensitivity measures allow less afflicted doctors work, risk lower capacity and/or potentially infectious doctors working. problem might good actually gotten vaccinated, tons douchebags get vaccinated won’t wear mask say “I’m vaccinated”. 

It much better overall society everyone wears damn masks nobody needs to, might quite get vaccines unfortunately. would save many lives. r/coronavirus punching air Lol also country reached herd immunity yet, despite trying. doesnt seem work covid Let's stop pretending New York anything kill thousands people reason. death rate still double Illinois, plenty incredibly stupid obviously incredibly stupid policies happening time. one really stuck putting covid patients back nursing homes. death rate also fact another major wave mean much. Basically nowhere true second wave. separate outbreaks different parts states/countries may look like second wave glance, yet see city get whalloped get whalloped 4 months. Countries hit earlier similarly hard like Italy fared much, much better New York did. ""It early"" real excuse.

There pandemic response getting TV pretending really mad everything people ignore election platform reducing healthcare spending made good middle pandemic. add suicides count. Coronavirus isn’t way die. Yes, NY/NJ first wave, NJ looks like may starting second wave, NY less so, still pretty flat. even eating drinking. That's hardcore, kudos used shop night store almost empty reduced hours always packed go. choice everyone flood places reduce hours. There’s thing, people tend confuse moderation reasonableness, absolutely thing. message sent way mark “somewhere middle” two perceived extremes doesn’t always mean sensible, mean people afraid seen “extremist” (by whose standards?) - that’s polarization many. It’s exactly reasonable meet social purposes share meal people middle pandemic that’s devastating world, yet considered extreme (in part there’s many people fervently preaching exact opposite). 

Granted, locking basement going outside even walk way top, really never heard anyone (though definitely don’t doubt existence people). single infected person set chain transmission causes dozens, hundreds, thousands secondary cases ultimately big outbreak, keeping distance people instead giving frivolous wants/needs actually sensible thing do. nearly 8 billion people planet transmissible potentially deadly virus, everyone takes precautions moderation still lot infections deaths going on. See [this model] showing meeting one friend maintains level connectivity lot higher network essential worker network lot connected one essential workers.
Visiting friend means reach almost households community, reach you! includes lots people don’t even know. virus easily travel far beyond many others. even know you’re infected. It’s connected, effective, network transmission.

One consider lot essential workers, perfect isolation importantly loads people meeting way one contact, it’s extreme say everyone isolate definitely strive rather staying somewhere middle. Trouble is, never solid unified message serious pandemic situation importance really following preventive measures. Lots contradicting messages government, experts also groups individuals dedicated downplaying pandemic. people lost, fatigued many settled choosing easier path actually adhering infection control guidelines. yet rebelling rich public health attempts stop virus... missing basics airborne transmission isn’t obvious airplanes aren’t much worse grocery stores. 

Traveling frowned upon that’s disease moves new areas. people travel sick asymptomatic cause big outbreak region didn’t big outbreak. know actually spoken Swedes, they're back living normal lives, ever really stopped

As Norwegian living close border Sweden, straight lying B-cells seems forget coronaviruses neutralizing antibodies disappear sterilizing immunity lost time. CD4+ CD8+ T-cells better memory become activated reinfection, reduce severity disease.

Vaccines may predominantly create B-cells responses yearly booster shots may necessary, certainly necessary prevent infection transmission (some vaccines may produce better CD4+/CD8+ responses others, nobody knows approaches winners there).

Which really less said day #1. Vaccines possible, need boosters, immunity reinfection 12-24 months like coronaviruses. alarmist. waiting outside take today, fellow customer started telling theory I've never heard. waiting credit card returned stuck listening him. kinda funny started asking worked.

His theory Iran spraying chemical roof tops pay back US assassination Irani general. Trump never infected staged. virus even deadlier said, Trump nothing stop it. 

 surprised anti-trump conspiracy. know floating around there. made think someone write coffee table book conspiracies origin. ""months away vaccine"", that's wishful thinking Imagine millions people US furloughed. AGAIN. Without stimulus. bad news antibodies seem stick around long - vaccine might well much use fart thunderstorm.  that's biggest tragedy -- propaganda campaign successful people rebel trying stop virus. rich literally murder millions wealth redistribution (which taking care unemployed prolonged lockdown mobilizing society deal virus would required) organized propaganda campaign.

And normalized mass death next virus shows kills 5% people, 1-1.5%, much easier say ""too expensive anything, die"" idiot. Go back Q cult. stops unacceptably high. corona news isn’t going change depending leader unless results different actions warrant it. 

If media starts focusing good news... ever consider might actually reflect reality?  Dude, Sweden stricter measures us Norway since June. Sweden lax measures first months realized wrong approach. Sweden *not* example looking prove lax measures way go business owner called Jim Wilson 2GB. personally knew seven business owners, men, taken lives they’re livelihood failed.

Saying “wasn’t bad” makes sound like touch moron. Leaders must held accountable preventable horror. hope well being. Would whole state? Can't counties declared disaster areas Texas?  Lol exactly, even much 2021 kind ridiculous seen latest AZ data? That’s pretty negative takeaway quick comment. myth describe comes 
31% US voting population. selfless wear proper PPE public, protect OP, also prevents spread vulnerable.  way save lives everyone adheres strict precautions. u/studentdoctor563 taking precautions (when many people not) it’s commendable. pissed cornflakes? 1. one talking US. 
2. US 200 million people. fact require yearly booster shots confirms it’s never going away, no? eradicated, wouldn’t need keep giving vaccines. might cure one day haven’t managed cure virus existence. think it’s stay become much less deadly figure effective treatments good vaccines.  Actually, Singapore reported 0 cases recently, October 3 days without local much community transmission Singapore; cases linked migrant worker dormitories quarantined. Good job Victoria! entire world conspiracy influence US election? can't possibly delusional Theoretically, yes. let's realists. masks leak. People spending 7h head head. can't shoot person decides obey mid flight can't breath ease.

Flying bad, bad idea matter what. everybody takes lockdown seriously 60 days, virus would gone already No, locking hard needed crime civilized society. 🤦‍♀️ 🤣 read depends variables. old person. sick get. health person's immune system beyond normal reduction due age. many flu deaths day last year Utah? bet ya nobody gives shit know/find fit narrative spreading fear Congratulations! I’m happy guys handled pandemic well you’ll way normalcy time. Yes, ploy enable supplies healthcare workers global shortage. difference happened supply became available, governments quickly changed tune said masks required important. US refused change messaging still politicizing it, even now. cares, it’s relevant wave in. got tickets see Bring Horizon next September really that's want. Maybe two festivals UK, next September finally actually go trip partner, we've around Ireland there's much Uhhh ok??? Stroke needs anti stroke medicine administered within specific time period.... wanna go cheesy tourist traps manhattan, like wax museum ripley’s believe attraction  least ones built Apple Google designed specifically prevent that, dumb people still fear use them. would forced software update effective. also important remember viral load (how much virus gets inside you) big effect death rate nurses 4%!!! old, got exposed lot viral particles immune system reacted. people confirmed infected groups families together. Sooo it’s scary, it’s also, said, unclear. crap. everyone dressed nurse Halloween actual nurse... issue company lied covered asbestos decades.

Why anyone trust company showed willing deliberately poison consumers, lose profits? yes  Whatever happened capacity limits place stores? Seems would help bit. head PiS probably engineered brother's death plane crash, admit weakness now. anything swine flu made things worse, turned lot less deadlier hyped up. made people less likely prepare think. Ayn Rand used ten words one would sufficed.

And eight ten words whiny self-important. big difference b/w going restaurant sleeping next diseased corpse. beds ventilators, enough ICU nurses take care patients.

And Herr Streeck like ""don't worry, big deal, look case numbers long still ICU beds available! perfectly okay case numbers go up! fact, hoping numbers would go lot summer!"". Probably still successful anyone know ever be. MUCH different situation thoroughly discussed Reddit $1000 cash every resident might make things interesting. 🤑 doubling jobseeker, implementation jobkeeper introduction free childcare earlier year would libs scomo branded radical socialists USA. Lol someone sat Infront someone covid confirmed, absolutely get plane catch covid.

Willing bet people wearing masks/properly taking necessary precautions.

Or dumb ass got whilst coughing lungs woulda blatantly sick.

We thousands people fly New Zealand believe there's many cases people catching covid someone else planes. can’t ask people give year lives.

See back years. already restricted, exceptions rape/incest, threat life mother, congenital disorders. Supreme Court equivalent struck last one unconstitutional.

So theory women still get abortion birth would kill them. baby going die shortly birth, carry term watch die.

In practice already sort hard find good doctor it. many catholic gynecologists would order unnecessary tests referring right doctor, hoping run clock get women time frame longer legal.

My *prediction* protests carve limited exception lethal birth defects pass court. women forced give birth dead babies, really disabled ones. Deaths 10% hospitalizations. death rate spikes reach hospital capacity sound like fucking sociopath. get this. ""Yeah undocumented workers, farms would stop producing food."" 

If require illegal labour uphold food production channels, essential sector matter, tell system broken? 

Similarly, paying livable wage service industries because, ""the tips get line."" (Or whatever variation excuse.) pretty much every western country pay staff without requiring customer add charity top, surely tells system also broken (or least, needs looked at?) even about? Russia communist 30 years time region experiencing lockdown fatigue Lombardy going almost impossible get pandemic control anywhere. done island nations far, that's strict travel restrictions unlikely persist long term. US unique failure control virus. slightly hand western countries, many European countries bad US always been. get testing online quickly. Hypoglycemia, pregnancy, weight loss diets, overactive thyroid, don’t have/ don’t access balanced diet valid reasons someone would need eat drink something frequently. can’t tell people can’t eat, it’s immoral. 

There many people isn’t case for, like treat hospital. doesn’t mean it’s applicable everyone though. doctors visit today. doctor told compare death past years covid hasn’t contributed excess death. live NYC, one hardest hit locations world motherfker said what, doctor????? Hold beer. Florida guess based observation current realities. public health officials (experts) tend focus recommendations science suggests, minimizing political economic areas areas focus outside expertise. 

The political economic infrastructure required effectively implement strict lockdowns place.

It’s irony reflected people ‘Red States’ tend realize much transfer funds goes Blue Red. 

So social ‘safety net’ is, stands, attack people benefit most. 

To implement kind targeted financial support requires bare minimum infrastructure. built takes time don’t have. 

An example Florida Republicans deliberately crippled unemployment system. became needed conduit aid Feds broke down. 

Another example direct financial support Feds provided citizens. people lost income payments pittance. political reality required funds sent huge numbers people don’t need provided usual interface well resourced corporate grifters manipulation advantage. absolute terms massive federal expenditure. 

I yet hear single person give concrete proposals protect people join ranks already destitute hard shutdown broadly mandated. Good know possible month-to-month variance. really see point testing earlier staying inside since felt sick anything anyway. Now, I'm lasting problems constant fatigue getting winded easy like I've never experienced, it'd nice confirmation case need treatment. Madrid. 3?  say that? hope true experts like say q4 2020 going hardest part pandemic think already past us Lack personality IMO hanging Chad. would riot government wanted put cork ass tho. Vaccines produced type reply ur post full shit incredibly arrogant I've seen data, various spikes result first wave hitting different states different points. Coachella PiS people can't understand virus magically dissapears Christmas? NO! NO! WHY! Everyone go back going outside! Damn it! though would least three years this! Whether first wave protect fight pandemic. ""essential"" fast food/grocery workers seem top vaccine lists. Shocker. work PCP. I’d say it’s medium risk don’t invasive procedures (unless it’s absolute emergency) don’t patients CPAPs ventilators.

All patients wear masks (regular ones, nothing fancy). personally use faceshield masks (questionable quality FFP2s KN95s earloops instead headbands). I’ve tested 3 times turned negative.

I think comes combination patients wearing masks remember reading CDC guidelines HCWs back March mentioned two wearing surgical masks it’s equivalent worker wearing properly sealed N95s.

But comes intubating dealing ventilated patients? wouldn’t trust anybuthing genuine 3M Dragër FFP2/FFP3s. get hands one mask properly sealed face (i.e. facial hair regular masks underneath) goggle/faceshield, I’d say chances catching Covid anywhere low. I’m covered diarrhea Jesus! still first wave. --Faucci. rest easy. expect massive surge antivaxxers Covid-19 vaccines. next battle stupid truth lose. Ncov2 linger maybe decade that.

Humankind handling ""information age"" well Truth told really doubt get answers, I'm unsure countries New Zealand isolating strain people got. NZ know lot confidence cases linked cases particular strains originated from. Unless information provided can't really come conclusions.

If people plane strain makes likely guarantee. mixture strains know bullshit got one flight. get made t-shirt? people getting tested numbers accurate anyone wondering lazy google it, $1000 USD. port worker us immense solid. Immediately got tested second got sick. start yes, dont think strategies right help countries COVID-19 pervasive.

Contact tracing makes sense small number cases. way France actual lockdown. We’ve free west long, black Americans notwithstanding, us confuse cooperation sacrifice losing freedoms. 

There many dictatorships West stretching 1980s. Nice link Russia usually agitates right wing crowds Italy (and arguably elsewhere well), Communist party. lmao, simple fuckin muppet. wave according epidemiology pandemic experts. That's wave graph one talking waves. bf thinks safe fly visit casinos :-/ saying we're headed right direction  Ah famous study sponsored airlines. Poland outlawed abortion? 

This religious zealots shouldn’t power. completely ignore science - choosing human death suffering. best soap drama world! Tapping temple right now. 4k strategy is, get people fucking wearing masks. Trump free excuse mandate Fauci advise such. Trump said much debate two. follows ""his advisors, including Fauci"".  Fauci literally, record, vague mandatory masks. 
 
&amp;nbsp;  
 
It would another thing altogether Fauci saying ""I told Trump make masks mandatory"". 
 
Look way Fauci talks media own. Needs fucking man up. want look back think: ""what direct outspoken?"" 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
Strategy? strategy saying things giving advice saves lives. saying ""Maybe masks mandatory day soon"". 
 
It ""how avoid fired orange idiot? Oh, job utmost ability"". 
 
Fuck that. guess right states enough done. even live USA. Im sick seeing stupidity play out. actually stroke? find what's wrong? 

Sorry, mieszam Polski z Angielskim, ale bardzo trudno mi pisać po Polsku:/ keep riding first wave there's vaccine, possible they'll never get second? submission removed because

Wish luck. war also comes refugees. 

This disease going hurt lot people already hurting. study limited time good sir. exciting drag race ever. warns 'vaccine nationalism' - ""Nations must work spirit cooperation rather selfishness fight coronavirus""

That's kinda ironic. surprising country believes el susto.. def wear masks. lies Thanks 🙂 stick first wave foes mean get second third? Incorrect. make people NPO (nothing mouth) hospital time. hydrate flight 2-3 hours nothing. People like though. opposite would better. miss grocery shopping 3am walmart. Place empty. again, whats proposal? like S.Korea, works there? exactly do? SK nearly outbreak like Europe US see now. numbers pale comparission. evidently lax meassures like SK work Western countries.

Lockdowns neccessary. much dont want them. Sad thing is, people like reason force early get away softer shorter Lockdowns (like SEA countries). argue something else, havn't seen propose anything substantial yet. cry Lockdown harsh. Yet exactly lead Lockdown neccessary. Numbers rising like crazy, wont stop half hearted meassures like now. topic trainwreck sub. make sound like obvious idiots want open schools, similar antimaskers. However, truly believe science need know science point toward children main driver nothing conspiratorial nothing like mask debate. comment calling children ""plague rats"" one highest upvoted sad. Hey! I've seen one before.  Hahaha, no, appreciate concern literally zero chance influencing me. They're very... educated, I'll say, constantly talking latest thing ""heard about"" - think last time something anti-christ - generally change subject. see maybe week. appreciate concern, though, I'd probably give somebody advice too. heading straight inevitable complete lockdown anyway 

According Interior Minister Jan Hamáček, there's simply majority cabinet complete lockdown - we'll also see new Health Minister want proceed. 

In event, think lockdown sorts; spontaneous lockdown, people afraid leave homes, factory warehouse/distribution centers workers calling sick *en masse*, supermarkets working skeleton crews (granted, self-serve checkouts help great deal regard, wish smaller supermarkets - typically see mostly hypermarkets like Tesco, Globus Albert). 

And arguably, spontaneous lockdown scenario could even economically devastating planned lockdown...a managed disaster vs. slow-rolling, control disaster. believe sceptical optimism, November December date coming quick. Well, really surprising find. \s Yeh mate, pandemic. million people, including thousands healthcare workers, lost lives, idiot. friends course choice - personally, would distance two quickly. far likely influence influence them. spent last 25 years Mars, fact know “both sides” issue. conservative Ideology fundamentally anti-handout; Republicans office wanted robust stimulus package, would Democrats. ""months away vaccine"". Maybe healthcare workers elderly general population likely year away looks 25% US population infected March. Based seasonality see likely virus transmission rate collapse summer. course cruises... much 1/3 would willing take vaccine 4-5 years enough testing done? Still believe China they've less 5,000 deaths? guy corrupt! He’s making millions called pandemic go again! mean numbers infectet people...I'm astonished undpreparedness healthcaresystem.

PPE problem germany, ICU Beds problem yet, Berlin Corona Zentrum hundreds ofs beds still empty. Germany seems prepared stupidity people, will! 2-5 times better europe. Hi mate, meaning dismiss people done harder. presenting opinion (which know opinion many age bracket), disagree hard lot people appreciate situation tough.

Mine work home holiday, stating nice work home. company revenue shredded unfortunately bought intl Company, job keeper wasnt available us, hence got pay cuts. People job keeper earning good portion last 6 months still worked 50 hour weeks high stress job. 

Of time lose job, best. Try dole without corona support. tough I've done it. 

That's life though. people win people lose. time business owners employees, countries old people dying. Unfortunately really seem middle ground.

Hopefully get back feet flights resume mean time maintain financial support people like you! Pre planning longer term fault, covid short term cause. Well yeah big cities like Paris (especially social distanciation tons place) obviously lot spreading. anything i'm actually surprised lot cases there. believe science. Yes, simple. one pro-active governments back March, possibly knew healthcare system verge collapse best times could cope increased load. cases 10s-100s throughout spring summer exploded autumn wave. What's going rest Europe (complacency developed summer combined people going back indoors) amplified fact Poland never real first wave everyone bought 'it's problem here' fallacy. everyone wearing masks (at least Europe true), still happening? Can't second wave first one never stops.

*taps temple* was, get tested. Seemed like normal work day (life completely normal everywhere Poland). nobody waiting parking lot, nobody distress (except little boy appeared broken arm). 

I say obviously didn’t go Polish hospitals, may case people waiting halls. However, there’s one hospital Poland...

Another thing consider; COVID positive patients segregated everyone else? 


Go narrative, get downvoted. thought actors.. /s seem making sweeping statements grounded scientific fact.

The simple fact know long immunity last anyone claims beyond 6 months scientific basis claim.

Perhaps COVID 19 similar SARS found immune response decades later (an immune response necessarily mean protective/sterilising immunity though) although due small number people actually got infected know much. perhaps behave like Coronavirus's circulated human populations much longer.

We simply know yet. Yes short term (6 months so) immunity form seems likely, longer that, talking arse.  righty, misled unsustainable thrust article. Here's need know:
""""Exposure possibilities flight cases include in-flight, overnight transfer/pre-flight unknown acquisition flight. incubation period COVID-19 may short 2 days, potential in-flight/airport transmission exists outbreak [4,5]. In-flight transmission plausible exposure cases Group 1 Group 2 given seating arrangements onset dates. One case could hypothetically acquired virus close household contact previous positive case, confirmed case onset date less two incubation periods flight, symptom onset flight case 48 h flight. In-flight transmission common exposure four cases (Flight Groups 3 4) date onset within four days flight possible tertiary case. case Group 3 developed symptoms nine days flight may acquired infection in-flight possibly flight transmission within household. ""
So, actually duration flight 17% occupancy might might anything 13 people infected. may infected boarding. careful conclusions draw article. still careful plane wear N95 Studentdoctor563 does. think we're dealing will-definitely-kill-me virus though. difference happened supply became available, governments quickly changed tune said masks required important.

I think ploy wrong start. contrary , China since day 1(the day Wuhan locked-down) telling truth masks --- important everyone must wear one. Yes , shortages 2-3 weeks, since price went fast, production picked really fast thousands factories switched making masks overnight. that, friend, called force free market work. 

If American CDC done thing truthful mask beginning, pretty sure thing would happened here. Instead, trust power free market, ruined people's trust them. killed happen probably raised murdered. people can't think rationally government's responsibility think make follow restrictions. bad destroying country fighting women lgbtq important people's health. Yes, like boast Covid death rate ten times Norway. layman, think anyone knows B cell memory fast enough even capable preventing severe disease. Hey guys made though! Waves double edged sword mean point kinda Agreed, big difference choosing locked forced upon you.  

Unless lived idea doesnt. numerous anecdotal reports reinfection clinicians. Problem media scientific lit. discount til genomic evidence. Gene sequencing limited Western countries. public nasty surprise. still pretty bad. back March rates time. Portland area already seeing record high cases deaths. I've never happier live isolated capital city world year. played large part keeping infections west low. 

Well done Victoria! Nah man meme's Good Guy Greg reason. Even everyone susceptible immediately, reinfections rare many countries.
It depends two thing: 

1. reinfection info even collected? Germany admitted that, example. saw hundreds people claiming reinfection social media, one listens officially. Also, collecting sequencing-confirmed cases miss almost every case.

2. infections testing random heavily depending individual character?

If fully random, Israel data, example, would suggest everyone susceptible recovering. fact, assume that's improper usage word ""asymptomatic"" (for Chinese gov.)

they like ""people truly asymptomatic &amp; people still incubation period therefore show symptoms yet"".

so good sign, caught outbreak early stage. fair share though.

[Bunnings particularly juicy morsel Compare covid twin brother SARS immune response 17 years later, common cold. Also, would still seeing hundreds even thousands reinfections even hard test for. reliable tests? think key reducing risk travel. mean main driver pandemic. conflating things. Look bigger picture listen science instead gut feeling. hard track verify reinfection clear cut claim. Particularly lack testing first wave.

'we're seeing ton reinfections seven months later think kind good.'

Not really 7 months long, article says coronavirus's give 6 12 months immunity, entirely possible COVID 19 towards latter half scale come winter proportion got exposed initial March wave end susceptible again. There's also Wszystkich Świętych. Shit's hit fan couple days. Triage started Netherlands early.  I'd love to, hopefully concert back make way end world.

I'd pick SxSW Coachella. Austin amazing city. Coachella really stopped music saying there. line quality really gone down. First wave, third wave? stop getting conflicting reports? body continuously produce antibodies every pathogen ever come contact with, that'd ridiculously inefficient.

The real indicator long term immunity would B cells, tests expensive difficult scale we're going see many reports them. actually quite hard track verify reinfections, many people get tested wave 1 usually need negative test 2 prove longer (which countries wave 1) getting positive test again. 


It's quite likely true number reinfections higher immunity wane time (we know timescale). 


Yes correct reinfection far appears rare, say there's 30 odd millions cases likely overstating it. time goes on, immunity initial March wave may start waning reinfections become common. Poland banned abortion recently, longer democracy. veto Poland-Hungary anti-democratic friendship, Europe can't take action.
I think Germany would happy help political context. remember. wrote ""seems"" ""?"" im claiming immunity definately lasts. looks like though forgot Hitler Healthcare professionals thinking maybe enough money say f walk away...for good.

Unless they're talking covering goggle vents. /r/blursed normal conditions, agree. actual high viral conditions, think good enough would want full protection P100. arguably, spontaneous lockdown scenario could even economically devastating planned lockdown.

Yeah, well that's sort exactly meant previous comment. Shame see it, worse know deliberately ignore it. honestly seems like approaching dead-end slowly surely, instead slamming brakes still time left hurt much more. 

In either case, depends people anyway. November still people denying, bypassing restrictions, ignoring anything epidemiologists say, might well let roll see takes us.

No, get PPE. gave us bullshit cloth masks full well knowing science favoring airborne version virus indoor setting poor ventilation. kids affluent families class every day private school they're pandemic pod private tutor - they're learning algebra time.  

Anyone believes OK close schools year two kids equally affected ignorant existing educational inequalities, pandemic response made far worse. Zero cases unrealistic goal. think might literally impossible. 
I dont really answers ideas think riots hands even tried hope logic changes post-election, since nothing getting approved Nov 3rd. least us say fitst wave.

We europe complacent ward second wave... Would independent rise Europe? True. need several symptoms tested :/ 
And worst thing is, rises infection rates blamed protesters... :/ cooperation looks like. away adversary work together, people. 3% people died thought? Prawns. What’s sounds??? Oh sounds avalanche tax dollars leaving schools kids pulled homeschool private schools somehow public schools can’t. open secret phase III trials going swimmingly

How know this? I'd love right I've really seen anything. researchers blinded too? freedom, none responsibility. Wow lmaoooo personally knew seven business owners, men, taken lives they’re livelihood failed.

I believe true. cooperation looks like. away adversary work together, people. dont go much health, im scarred vaccine going become available, gonna many people line get it, im afraid getting virus waiting prevent virus every landing? Impressive. Maybe could wear masks!

I'll show out. also expects social distancing masks needed 2022. see. Thanks COVID HOAX DOU :(((( mean really want actually adopt proper strategy zero cases like New Zealand Australia, mainly lots people won’t follow rules second full lockdown can’t see feasibly police whole country 🤷‍♂️ Well, would never actually fully suppress virus low point wave.

All viral wave means rise fall infection. real scientific definition. something people use casually refer basic large-scale path reversed. First hits younger (schools, bars, etc) spreads older family members. means increase cases like see extremely likely younger population might primary vehicle infection. numbers increase might late.

Yes, data now, that's taking measures now, question reason government took preemptive measure know enough One thing must said right many classes forced online lessons outbreaks. law everyone quarantined kid 14 must work home possible stay home get state relief. reality already 

True, working really well, companies everything get around this, want people home. something like 5 100 people 14 days, imagine leave 30 40 100 people home whole semester. Yes try contain best can.

Says lot capabilities know anyone expected anything different  😜 agree seeming pointless. Plus Antisocial Personality Disorder could swing ways. serves agenda, they're fine wearing mask. mother fully diagnosed ASPD wears mask. 

This study looking traits associated ASPD, looking confirmed diagnosed people, makes even confusing. N95 equivalent. FFP3 P100 are. Yay! still look forward second wave! I’m excited Well, one particular American is. leakage North Safety 7700-30. block exhaust, I'll pop ears air gets out. 3M might problem, don't. ""Quite bit leakage"" exaggeration case. Considering we’ve even come close period isn’t new cases day, think count year first wave next year second wave. LOL, defined stupidity.

This culture, able understand doctors scientists say, able understand happening France, England Spain, happen country too. them, politician, incompetent lazy fucks. pompous moron. mean immunity suddenly short 6 months? Slight hyperbole. low number. covid reinfection second hit 'more ""Our findings signal previous infection may necessarily protect future infection,"" said Dr Mark Pandori, University Nevada. average Monday Tuesday, take monday Tuesday divide number hours, comparable. Well duh still compatible happened read article. Also expect extreme rise cases soon vaccine approved people let desire socialize get better use vaccine excuse follow social distancing guidelines wear masks. There's real definition viral waves context. kind opinion right answer. Good luck man odds actually fine! Covid hard time transmitting surfaces. Flush turd November 3rd! mean ""circling drain""? Play politics instead taking care civilians.

Should like that. Thanks making clear. politicians really stupid. 

Greetings Italy. Yes, today, Tuesday, numbers 20 hours. late people now. Ireland, Spain, Italy, France.

What now? I'm exhausted. Poland closed next two weeks. open places like hotels, available guests currently accommodated closing 9PM. inb4 coROnAVIruS hOAx dOUuUu!!11!!!11111!!11 I'm getting little concerned re. Vaccine. Reports people becoming reinfected infection, constant news ""vaccine coming soon"" 
Supposedly China Russia working vaccine, yet people russia getting infected media blackouts China keeping count neg 1,000,000,000
To top off, even climbing numbers, leaders think time reopen restaurants, bard gyms. 
Like guy sang end Lorax.
Let die, let shrivel die issue us step-families, inlaws. like wouldnt fair us go one, other. pleasing everyone increases spread, visiting families may solution.  Worst case US get herd immunity next year. many people virus infect. Let's consider 0.1% number second: 328 million people US. 0.1% die flu would 328,000 deaths. 

The reality: 12,000 60,000 deaths annually since 2010.

By way, pandemic already resulted 300,000 (excess) deaths US. Covid FAR worse flu. assume lots people already wrote them, including media. dont think nice write aswell.

Ah, worry job all, worst thing could happen reply. mean numbers ad world news? 


Yes, believe world news. would help create nuanced approach deal Coronavirus. Making sure always extra capacity ICU's, people conditions medical attention need. waning immunity confirmed. 😧 hope second infection milder first, even immunity decline, body ""immune memory"" first encounter know fight back.

That's unmentioned elephant room whole thread rainbows sunshine. First one add something really highlighted ... reason populace Melbourne Victoria (largely) adherent measures, small part, due massive amount financial support provided infected, isolated quarantine, keep home. Businesses supported smaller way grants emergency funds .. course, universal health care. 


Tests free, readily available drive-through sites thankfully, get result back 24 hours (so quarantine longer waiting negative result). 


Without insubstantial amount ""socialist medicine"" support .. oh fund small matter able stop people arriving state, would fucked. Kudos China! Couldn’t proud PR currently hiding virus China. truly proves less-draconian, more-humanitarian measures also work contain it. (In comparison China.) Looking forward returning good ol’ Oz! course 14-day quarantine, is! Thank reminder. history reflect upon powerful. looking 4 month immunity actually covid mew study UK came out. welded people inside homes Wuhan first outbreak. yes, people go out. looks like super cautious, 

Somewhat ok measures + absolutely minimal tasting huge positive turnout = low number official infections.

The real numbers probably France, meaning worse France, since population 50% larger. reason huge 20~25% rate positive tests. almost 100% one region. you’re college age dealing underlying health condition you’ll probably one last people get vaccine, get one ! Well outbreak march/april extrenely limited geographical point view. hospitals became main source infections virus following opposite path compared today.

Let explain.

You overlap flu season covid. Limited testing. entered hospitals. first infected belong elderly age group. lockdown spread also continue home move younger age groups less symptoms. became quite hard understand kids would affected lockdown symptoms.

Now path reversed. First hits younger (schools, bars, etc) spreads older family members. means increase cases like see extremely likely younger population might primary vehicle infection. numbers increase might late.

I agree say. allowed primary kindergarten first monitor situation.

One thing must said right many classes forced online lessons outbreaks. law everyone quarantined kid 14 must work home possible stay home get state relief. reality already here. really. think best numbers I've seen suggest well half population must immune disease, quite possibly even around three quarters population. based estimated infectiousness disease, thought normal conditions one person maybe passes 2-3 people. case, well majority must immune disease starves get passed 1 people sick person.

The answer complicated questions length immunity granted vaccination recovering disease. immunity vaccination short-lived, say around 1 year only, vaccinations must periodically refreshed perpetuity keep disease check.  agree- he’s gentle understated! makes sense. 

Just clear, think signs immunity lastning atleast 8 months strongly outweigh signs immunity lasting. sucks youre getting voted cause youre right...masks effective vaccines theyre making covid19, ive read effectivity rate like 25-50% max vs masks two ppl wearing 75% effectivity 90 social distancing theyre right kinda masks.


Everyone lot places actijg like vaccine magically make everything go back normal see theyre burying head sand avoid reality. 

This isnt polio chickenpox. cant get vaccine whatever. sucls cant start acting like anti-maskers covid denyers ppl fed started going out. 

It sucks still part saving fucking lives. bars restaurants still open? S.Korea actually quick reaction: Instant lockdown major cities + massive test + population detain. 

They made successful scale country &amp; population, along pandemic(was Feb.) comparatively controllable. 

The ""Shinchoji Church Jesus"" organization acclaimed &amp; instigate people wearing masks &amp; ignorant social distance publically. Church instantly suppressed. 

Japan, somehow taking way milder action Covid, suffers longer Korea I'm sorry happened lost cafe. 

I commented elsewhere tough. Personally I've kept job home. Mental health so-so getting there. really, felt small business owners like yourself, jobless mortgage stress. would day day stress long period time. can't imagine.

Hopefully recovery comes quickly! 

All best business. suburb thinking restaurant? talk know topic never claimed anything.
I asked. Throw away nasty falling apart. Leave paper bag week want kill everything rotation. 

Masks improve filtration get clogged, use becomes harder breathe through. could daily working extremely dusty environments, basically never pandemic use. 

Sounds like steak disinfect clean n95 without damaging like washing ways easily can. 

Steam steak. Lol autocorrect. sounds like variance based “under control” (very deaths low positivity rate far 1%) end wave vs. end spike. America end wave never got virus control enough less certain percentage positivity. likely work outdoors vitamin deficiency

More likely killed diseases weak immune system

A high birth rate thus low mean age. 

Genetics, Africans active immune system, since live Humans pathogens co-evolved thus higher disease burden environment. also much higher genetic diversity. Chill epidemic. Proof lunatics support trump. This. Buckle up, cuz going absolutely fucking brutal winter. ain't one... NY left lockdown cases tracing set up.

Most country, however, using ""I believe WET PAINT sign, I'm gonna touch find out"" method. Schools kindergartens remain open, however bars restaurants closed events canceled. I’ve often heard anti-maskers claim don’t know anyone who’s it, thus must hoax like Trump either know means Douchbagery mandatory mask orders? heads could prepared... Facebook. Yeah. can't keep saying something like people start thinking immunity guaranteed short. worth, people know really think covid think possible get infected multiple times. probably getting different strain every time fly. Poland detecting much lower % infections. Poland 13291 people hospitalized 1078 people ventilator 5613 hospitalized (1 day outdated data) 461 ventilator (current data). Yet Poland lower 7-day average new cases. per capita terms Czechia worse situation, detect larger % infections soft-lockdown, situation Poland likely worse Poland week two.

If Poland near 100% detection rate would likely 30k-40k daily average cases week ago, would likely 13k-17k. I'm sure trying subvert democracy install theocracy demonizing citizens. Time plan human sacrifices God Sun. point.... ""Come think it, demographics....""

You know paragraph? That's taken I've said claimed something stated.

So address move on. two things, right? Completely harmless, 100% certain kill you. Got it.  too! May 😫 Cafe? come ...

Again, impossible unaffected, Sweden among least. tied denmark ending 3rd 0.1% difference. comparison *Europe* far trick - scientists everywhere world consider Scandinavia best possible comparison, especially exact case. understand? realize “Well don’t think so” counter argument that?


If actual scientific analysis have, use instead. layman analysis absolutely worthless me. saying consistently said due major differences societies 1:1 comparison explain ten times higher per capita death rate Norway Finland failure.


Because failure success purely based rest world.

For example, Finland 12 times amount deaths New Zealand, make Finland failure? person got reinfected got worse second time. knows many dang unknowns. Watch Europe. Whatever do, we’ll 2-3 weeks behind. Curfews started Europe major metropolitan cities 2-3 weeks ago.

A lot kind stuff, feels like politicians something “take action” regardless whether it’s effective. Sounds like American brand kkkhristianity me. shit. long last looks like Americans getting root coronavirus agenda. ""deadly"" virus kills small percentage old already sick people.

Watch say vaccine works small limited amount time. vaccines cheap countries buy plenty them. Vaccines meant drive economy even more.

Philantropy money/power never go together. year best weather lifetime. real winter year saved many tourism operators helped suppress colds flus. People sometimes get sick die. fact we’ve accepted literally humanity. attitudes didn’t change Spanish Flu, certainly won’t change virus. already coronavirus? not, extremely stupid plan. vaccine gone though standard safety trials. 

Coronavirus unknown here. possible coronavirus causing permanent heart damage 70% people. 0 evidence suggest vaccine risks. 

You're choosing likely risks unlikely risks. anything matter? aren’t risky, societal cost school astronomical. Perfect match COT (Cult Trump). That's hit first densest area country.

Yes, that's used example. 2 major causes lead death virus. able breath, ventilator long causing infection leading death.

That true. lot time attacking heart makes lung function diminish. Also cytokine found septic shock multi organ failure common immediate cause death, often due suppurative pulmonary cytokine storm, levels certain cytokines soar far beyond what’s needed, immune cells start attack healthy tissues. Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, catastrophic organ failure ensue.

Can't find data moment believe fraction covid deaths even patients went ventilator point. patients deathbed already approved covid drugs still getting worse able return families within days.

Absolutely false. Probably it¡s incredibly difficult get non bias information I'd also predict younger students would likely comply sort distancing regulations might imposed.

What's quite strange people predicted older students would likely comply. Passed covid relief twice. senate refused pass bill own. [Low-cost measurement face mask efficacy filtering expelled droplets range valved n95s vs. range cotton masks Everyone wants use poor people reason open school. Everything brought normal Tuesday poor minority students. overwhelmly segregated schools lower funding white counterparts. access tutoring fall behind, test prep, advanced courses. Paying college pipe dream. go go on.

Black people already vastly likely catch Covid die white people. find many students want go back school know, effected it. 

The gap already getting wider would continue without Covid. already know security people getting killed told people put mask go store? That's confront anyone wear mask. probably I've seen managers stop telling people cover mouth nose. stupid. unforeseen side effect leads scenario? It’s valid concern. hear ya man. It’s weird. post gets upvoted say reinfection rare could back normal sooner think. Odd get downvoted something like that...

Then idc bc it’s reddit still want message mRNA scary spelled House Representatives wrong. taskforce says even Switzerland increased hospital beds 50%, would give us reprieve 4-5 days. 

Do agree opinions flawed dangerous?? makes FDA approved vaccines unsafe? unapproved vaccines available? not. 

It doesn’t matter Trump says. job go Rah! Rah! Let’s go team! FDAs approve safe drugs. make good attempts looking similar vaccines good data understanding mechanisms specific chemicals interact body. vaccine approved scientists evidence something vaccine may cause long term effects. 


However, know sure observed said timescale. vaccines planning released based upon Emergency Authorisation based risk reward assessment. guy parties! prioritized getting back person classes. Honestly, think nationwide push get go. Get elementary school students back campus, keep middle high school students home. important emotional development, I'd also predict younger students would likely comply sort distancing regulations might imposed.

If parents good enough parents raise kid (bar sort physical handicap learning disability) stay home complete work age eleven, that's problem, society's. others thread mentioned, lot what's highlighted negative consequence going remote happening schools pandemic. open everyone see.  Since passage Child Left Behind, students able little work get moved along high school graduation anyhow. course did. hate Americans care power. ??? Seriously, know? 

I mean, part cuisine decent one imported India. Coronaviruses may different viruses this. may learning new things know before. second wave New Jersey - happens, people think happen ""soon"". Like flu? 

Ok, get combo flu/Covid shot fact we’re nearly 7 1/2 months we’re seeing widespread reports reinfection good thing. KN95s got eBay fit way better duckbill N95s friend brought hospital February. fog glasses, fail leak test, slide talk (unlike N95S tried).

It must depend face specific brands comparing. Except *money*. Since people everywhere pop claim ""But yet, need spread it!"", yes. transitioning back old normal puts lives risk, ain’t worth it.

The truth people aren’t mentally tough, self centered, don’t deal well change.

What fuck hard wearing mask go out? It’s clear could save lives beyond covid. example, wearing masks plus vaccine could seriously make influenza deaths almost non issue year. Lol, love ""but side effects!"" Crowd.

Like, yea I'm sure getting hooked ventilator ICU way better right? get downvoted constantly states coronovirus sub people dont like since different opinion things. Even I'm even talking opinion, people downvote soon see username. Fot instance, originally got downvoted saying Target gives $5 coupon getting flu shot there.

It extremely odd, agree. let roll back cares. Tell news subs reddit. again, bring point stupid hypocrisy left continues show world. Covid brings sorts questions. biggest ""open everything up"" person know says families care facilities people dying covid. Seems would drive liability insurance greatly.  think we'll dealing questions years. someone says sick tired something, annoyed something, telling feel. 

You sophomoric understanding logic rhetoric. come across someone spends hour websites studying logical fallacies constructing argument quite work. Kind feel like ass forgetting really tough time, smh. Probably explains lot reactions forum. I’ve share tough shit life guess that’s caused desensitized one greatest crises century it’s affecting people 60 Australian dollars 3m 6000 series half mask goes Aus major brick mortar retailer without risk buying fake. I've seen low 45 online, $15 worth get today respectable seller.

Full face around 260aud. I'm looking forward buying used bargain basement priced full face. Wearing safety goggles glasses mask kinda annoying woodworking. “band aid ripped off” exposes person really doesn’t apply Trump Jane. Jane political cult zealot revealed... again. Basically told people saved (category 3 guess, especially radiation sickness nuclear exchange) would euthanized police going given guns (which would big deal England). 

We asked allowed bash people's heads rock something euthanize them, guns. answer like ""officially allowed."" course that.

I think Sovjets expected thrust tanks Poland Germany towards Hamburg. 

And would get heavily bombed, ports big cities command centres. avoid reinforcement tropps send ship Denmark Germany, Sovjets would occupy us like beginning.

Saw actual Red Army plan part first attack plan fire 20 nukes South Denmark, doubt we'd even alive anything :) that's interfering God's plan trust God, get sick. 

fayth choice. Let teachers families would like in-person in-person, let would like online online. Mods frown edited titles.. Sounds like poor fella died broken heart honest. agree written wearing mask wilfully exposing others deadly virus. fact think shows propaganda working. acting like wearing mask throwing around vials Ebola. record wear mask public spaces asked so.  I'm surprised anyone ever listened ... Goodness dummy. reversed said even 5th grader tell mask works. People stubborn holding onto one thing said. hand, trump repeatedly lies, yet he's angel order come Yeah. ""Students dropping dead they're exposed COVID"" obvious tell-tale sign looks like form strawmanning genuine attempt argument. They're news, they're entertainment. Population density seem linked graphics) What? Whose got kinda heat? It’s 0 live right that’s sun came up... mask deniers know meet criteria perfectly. also always really stupid people grasp even basic science. absolutely true. 

If Trump shouted need wear masks order fight ""China virus"", American right would LOVE masks.  

But Republican approach sell Worry? attitude, consistent Trump's MO con man. Con men never acknowledge problems accept responsibility. They've printed Im talking already year. clearly hyperbole original commenters part... She’s wrong. covid didn’t happen trump would landslide. It’s still going close. Americans outside big tech/finance areas don’t want shutdown Exponential? mean like viral? definitely kill virus? like 2 percent chance get virus another 2 percent chance die virus...so .4 percent chance get virus die it... Get vaccine sure, little realistic. Maybe change title make consistent. agree think us getting kind loopy, trying times. also think reinfection anything rare viruses, would seeing spike time. get meals school, physical activity, health care

I don’t care anyone says. depend schools healthcare meals, you’ve failed country. coming doctor, too. boggles mind worried plague, yet we’ve let slip point decades. Hey look, President passes law making us longer trust appointees sudden start saying bunch shit different said past longer trust good news manipulation get support unsafe drugs going fast track meet political agendas. seemed quite extreme line compared I've heard infectious disease doctor family, wanted check sources could discuss her. Thank links! True however amazon basics Echo + Fire Tv stuff + warehouse hubs + (small) delivery service. guess basically want lot smart people talking. Hard government involved. get first vaccine subsequent ones become easier. like getting flu shot According science done mis-represented headlines, *net* gain new cases protests people stayed home time protests going on. That's thing ""protests contribute spread"" Maybe doesn’t realize it, giving ammunition right saying this. real, release damn thing  problem closing schools across board number children living poverty rely school much education. 

I careful covid, travel, dining out, bars, etc since March. Instacart groceries. think bars indoor dining closed, yes feel restaurant owners small businesses. We're world's richest nation, social safety net businesses forced open right now. 

Yet, real harm children keeping school. Children living margins marginalized. gap poor rich get greater, could affect entire generation. sad keeping schools open one America's top priorities yet not. intentionally misleading poorly designed study. 

The study asked people *views* certain measures like masks social distancing. that, drew conclusions *actions.* Three questions assessed adherence: 

- “Do think necessary avoid approaching people much possible coronavirus situation controlled?” (social distancing),

- “Do think necessary wash hands and/or use alcohol gel many times day coronavirus situation controlled?” (hygiene), 

- “Do think necessary use facemask (that protects nose mouth) Brazil?” (facemask).

These questions ask **opinions,** actions. warrant conclusion whatsoever individual’s actions. 

For example, there’s local road 25 mph speed limit. Based size road intersections buildings around it, etc, think unnecessary drive 25 mph - think stupid 40 mph appropriate speed conditions. 

However, still drive 25 mph road. 

If asked me, think necessary drive 25 mph road? 

My answer would vehement no. tells *nothing* actions, used opinion whether necessary guess actions, you’d absolutely wrong. 

This junk “science.” get stimulus thanks useless senate. hate country. ""We trust called experts.""

Kristi Noem confirm, brother tripple shifts doctor needs respond need someone. (dokter van wacht) fact, trend average age infections going way age. graph simply show assuming should. Maybe district, things fine. *every* district! What? No.

Is propaganda using emotionally manipulated framing. study trite - end mask wearing would expect find anti-social people compared overly social? follow everyone resists masks tendencies care others.

It's extrapolation propaganda, implied assertion anyone going along current dystopian measures bad person rather someone different opinion. way getting fall line. Whether correct thing masks.

 Propaganda technique necessarily mean purpose bad. reason say bad people clapping back bad person TM unable see type emotional manipulation could bad thing. hard act like give shit give shit. Hahaha, guys support help vast protests tens thousands people neighbour country ""We trust called experts.""

Kristi Noem last long. Cases going especially high schools opened. wife first Covid patient ICU week. Agreed. That's think offering virtual person depending family's needs good thing. 35 40% person right county rest virtual, yet they're also talking ending virtual December, seems like massively bad idea. problem is, we're east Asia. *want* become east Asia. things became bad. really pay attention covid idea heard, we're ""rounding corner.""

It's corner hell repubs find exciting. think sustainable locked economy indefinitely? virus never going away, realize that, right? bad person wear mask willingly expose others deadly virus Interesting timing, isn’t it? patient transferred last week. says surprised high quality care.

This article literally single person also first person entire facility? so? bottomed out? Lmao. TIL 900-1000 people dying per day pandemic ""bottoming out"". cannot work home kids (and kids old enough home alone) kids put school social distancing, mask times, limited capacity location, zero chance around kids would break prior (aka recess, etc).

The problem is, Chicago union even allow *that*. said that? ridiculous claim. agree. study necessarily mean much. answer simple I'd seen study saying wrong entire time measures taken?

Because moot argument. There's real world data would show ""what if"". Every simulation run showed restricting physical contact best course action. large number middle aged, old, old people US Europe makes ripe massive mortality. Similar province. large cluster accounted majority cases far. Initial spread wake happened mid-march. mainly spread workplaces family members. 8 280ish cases traced (we've travel related cases since may) made calculations numbers, Sweden 400 ICU beds total.

At peak 550 people Covid ICU probably possible scale massively.

The question going done seems strange infection rate increasing.  I’m sure people hope accomplish saying things like that. agree normal life doesn’t return within week vaccines going out, within 3-6 months? 

The fact people think life never return normal truly incredible. probably enjoyed quarantine aspect don’t want go away. Coronavirus impacts higher rate minorities,

So take think POC dumb? Well winter already forcing people indoors unfortunately, cases going high, least Canada right now. Nope, lift mask face clogged, effective. Also masks catch small particles electrostatic force, e.g. washing might reduce effect.

This flown one time, wore N95, bandana covering rest face, safety glasses gasket

I sleep well, though Same. certain gallows humor it. Again, schools closed India study. already made agreements produce 3 billion doses - include numerous vaccines across world production already. Lol ""highest single day increase"" reported 5-7 days earlier on. 

I actually said ""highest single day **total**"", ""fastest **rate** increase"".

Both obvious graph posted.

The second highest single day total June 24 1,698. October 23 10% higher June 24 total 1,870.

The seven day rolling average October 26 1,331 making highest seven day average entire epidemic. previous high June 18 1,089. seven day average October 26 22.22% higher June 18 average.

These literally worst reported numbers Sweden entire epidemic.

Keep laughing pal... don’t think BLM protests reduced rates. didn’t cause significant increase cases. They’ve pleading people aren’t listening. information -31 correction? corrected?

We've heard Sweden best world counting deaths, wonder possible... literally watched one neighbors walk another neighbor talk less 6 ft away masks. neighbors pretending doesn’t exist live Boomer neighborhood. Meanwhile, I’m simmering resentment self isolated home since March. Wonder odds becoming new normal long-haul and/or international air travel. health aspect, probably worthwhile. However, comes cost personal freedom convenience. everything life, tradeoff. Time tell whether governments / airlines require measures long-term; public accepting not.

On aside, drinking liquids flight, especially long-haul, may unhealthy due low air cabin humidly. able, try find way drink least little flights remain hydrated. minimum, bringing water snacks along case flight extended due traffic and/or storms. really care get get vaccine third surge first wave! Oh wow must changed !! That's good:( answer simple. Immunity generally lasts longer 8-9 months. less would know. shitty articles suggesting otherwise fear-mongering unfortunately gets clicks. 

We throwing every available resource thing. scientist already tried tested shitty idea might think up. picture group kids throwing handfuls gravel pool, lots ripples happening different times. Bottom line sucks pool matter are. thought could release prove conclusively 60% effective, minimum 2 months 30,000th person receives second dose minimum (something like) 53 covid cases among study population.

However, restricting may cause app longer function. many cases, reddit, information tracking server side app itself. prefer install reddit app use web interfaces even designed try get either use app login account. many layers dealing data collection people technical savvy deal all. avoid apps whenever choice app web versions. lock permissions. run pihole script block traffic places approve. Unfortunately, lot work maintain all. never ending game whack mole. initial theory move take blame them. Blame protesters blowing-up number cases.

Through compelling one US alliance thing. Trump PIS sign declaration (along Hungary, Belarus several third-world countries) they're pro-life, Trump (soon) appoints catholic fanatic Supreme Court. (nearly) outlaw abortion.

It's quite uncanny parallel PiS also stuffed Constitutional Tribunal cronies (like disgusting piece shit), invalidated exception leglslation allowed aborting fatally-damaged fetuses, legal anymore.

As Constitutional Tribunal, here's en-Wiki 2016 Julia Przyłębska, ally Law Justice, appointed President Constitutional Tribunal. **Her appointment open challenge unconstitutional appointed directly President Republic rather elected judges Tribunal, required Poland's Constitution**. controversial appointment brought total women fifteen person Tribunal two.

Yeah, organ responsible interpreting constitution made unconstitutional. That's one things EU means tell ""rule law"" violated here. joke.

Arguably *previous* government started it, trying elect new judges old judges term expired. *that* invalidated, not... whole ridiculous clusterfuck: 22 December 2015, Sejm passed law reorganised Constitutional Court. new law introduced **two-thirds majority mandatory participation least 13, instead 9, 15 judges. Art. 190 (5) Polish Constitution requires majority Furthermore, pending constitutional proceedings previously wait docket[clarification needed] six months, exceptional circumstances three months. Court bound handle cases according date receipt. Judges Constitutional Court dismissed request Sejm, President Department bill approved Polish Senate 24 December 2015 overnight session, signed President Duda 28 December 2015. said result, decision-making capacity court **On 9 March 2016, Constitutional Court ruled amendments non-compliant Polish constitution. Polish government regards verdict binding, based rules introduced amendment, refused publish verdict, binding condition legal validity.**

So... **they tried change institution enforcing constitution works - defined constitution, making obviously unconstitutional, institution said change unconstitutional, government claims institution's complaint invalid work according new rules. unconstitutional. reject changes must, according government, accept changes**.

Truly mind-boggling. Ok, maybe wording caught guard. 

Obviously one person controls this, head FHM held responsible choices end. Unless believe accountability. Say again. Every hospital near full capacity given day. That's hospitals make money. news. hospital 110% capacity, problem. get logic reason here! mental health. Humans aren’t meant isolated know politicized stay indoors. curious things change election comparing estimated deaths confirmed deaths I’m antisocial, ass hole times, still wear mask go out. seldom go out, mask on!  F LIVES GO PACKERS!! Nah, I’d rather change within piss choices risk. non-zero number children die every year go school. die infectious disease contracted schools, car accidents going school. Fewer students teachers would die kept schools 100% virtual forever. However, socialization learning important, virtual learning especially younger children substitute person learning. COVID, sent kids school even though risk associated benefits outweighed risk.

dude...Yeah, kid get something die. chances slim. I've teacher 16 years never death student. It'll happen, something common. 

With Covid19, least 2 deaths one year. 

&amp;nbsp;

As getting ""COVID flue season numbers""...and problem. We're not, far. Hence want kids teachers going back. 8 months Dovid19 total 4 years ""flu season"". 

When numbers Flu-season levels? vaccine (I'm honestly pessimistic long term vaccine) treatments available (like administered Trump). 

&amp;nbsp;

We're ready yet. still 27% available beds, expect prepared scenario start seeing increase ICU beds regions start pause elective surgeries - since post-op beds think easily converted ICU ones. Lotta stupid people world don’t think America could ever quashed thing unless rest countries also quashed it. would inevitably come back. could better, yes, rampant spread anywhere threat everywhere globally connected are. “Lockdown cases opening never going work. aren’t going eradicate virus way (or way).”

It depends lockdown for.

You right: lockdowns won’t/can’t eradicate Covid. (In fact, virus animal reservoir eradicated means.)

OTOH, lockdown prevent hospitals overrun, yes, work. last resort else failed. hospitals overrun, means else ***has*** failed, affected region needs lock down.

If hospitals overrun viral levels region drop, lockdown worked.

That mean another lockdown won’t needed future community / region cannot manage control virus public health measures. Literally recommendations last 5 6 months, outside much possible.  probably don’t actually want that! you’re trial, 50/50 shot getting placebo ;) situation country whole complicated categorize like that. ebbs flows nationally speaking low case counts since March. 
 
Drill individual states/regions though get clearer picture. example, live Ohio. cases pretty low throughout spring, rose mid-summer (Wave 1). cases dropped months, August September pretty quiet here. we're heavy increase (Wave 2) Republicans accusing Democrat's this. end. 2021 might fuck right arse though. Time tell. Even adjusting population differences, U.S. faired better response pandemic 1950s 2020s. It’s Rated-G vaccine. Nah dude, Americas approaching Third Reich got confused. Really interesting American perspective. exactly type propaganda would see U.S. Fox parties switched. flew states work, uncomfortability valid. 0/10 would recommend.

My coworker (same flight) came Covid week afterwards, hospitalized. quarantined trip, we're confident that's picked up. come Poland construction workers. voluntary tests borders.

If people tested borders, *know* driven construction workers Poland? Herd immunity could still beat vaccines. I'm actually saving money going anywhere. perhaps importantly statins steroids limit absorption vitamin d. even nowhere near ""definitely kill you."" That's misinformation. got moving, right direction.  GOP mission statement. That’s semantically invalid imperative It'll turn Boris Johnston starve children. used call “the party no,” seems kind days people post things paywall provide copy relevant portions article? Sigh. never said like said, genuinely curious. know Atlanta, Austin, Dallas pretty progressive cities south. know anything Alabama. I’d love see study mask usage general intelligence, though could imagine results pretty easily. would conducted? Maybe questionnaire “general knowledge” problem solving type questions? probably better us is. Experts say real daily numbers infected people may 6-10x higher number positive tests. average 20% tests positive (AFAIK means epidemic way control). doctor send testing SEVERAL symptoms. personally know people lost smell taste qualify testing. Also, sister works company 50-100 people infected (employees + families, included), yet one person tested. cours positive result. 1 infected person statistics. Can't 2nd wave never really got 1st. methodology study pretty limited. accurate summary people thought covid never positive test lower cognitive scores would expect. leaves door open multiple interpretations.

That said, like studies refute this, incredibly worrisome. spent summer knowing long-term damage healthy people possibility concerned spent nearly nothing trying actually determine risk. knowing nothing fall. go eBay order legit

Oh man gave good laugh.

N95s widely available US since March. N95s eBay year I'd strongly encourage check them, may actually counterfeit, KN95s.

Even Amazon, somewhat reputable eBay, KN95s mislabeled N95s available public (it's possible changed recently, even couple months ago legit N95s available consumers). One easy way tell ear loops-- mask ear loops, KN95 (or less), N95 masks require full head elastic spec. Interesting multi- vitamin 1000 IU supplement bought taken yet 5000 IU. Thanks this. mean Mensa need federal bailout lose many members? Lockdowns work, done lockdown ends.

This common sense stuff, virus disappear took 2 weeks shelter place. Countries controlled spread locking need take control gained use it. 

Contact tracing strict crowd control key phase 2. rocket science, plenty examples around world throughout history correctly. makes sense. wondered stress acute illnesses part Imagine reaction government said this:  

""OK, truth. virus easily spread. 20% people get virus require hospitalization.  hospitals overwhelmed reject new patients.  

**EVERY PATIENT NEEDS HOSPITALIZED HOSPITALIZED DIE.**   

Hospitals run supplies remain overwhelmed weeks time. means even hospitals able save patients.  

We could easily see Case Fatality Rate increase much 18%. means 1 Million people get infected 180,00 die minimum. 10 Million get infected means 1.8 Million die. 

If think economy bad shape wait almost 2 people every 10 get infected dies. entire country come complete standstill, food, medicine, clean water become scarce supply.   

Imagine water company enough trained staff run water plant, electric company enough trained staff man electric plants. can't run without support safe thing shut break."" 

Freedom free, price always paid. like facts change depending needs moment... Need justify nationwide restrictions? ""The regions different"" ... Need justify domestic travel restrictions? ""The regions same""...

Again missing context even though sentences cut out. 

Because situation different different regions place nationwide ban elderly visitations yet working local authorities place local bans needed instead - elderly people Västerbotten still get visits cases Stockholm Skåne increasing. 

And second part... literally cut parts paragraph gives context ... like them. 

1. \- discussion having. 
2. think important General advice avoid many contacts. 
3. fact, also quite clear advice traveling almost always means new contacts people, says Anders Tegnell. regions (Skåne least) reached maximum testing capacity though. increase less expected, may contributing factor. whos going give people lost jobs money go get supplements? diagnosed low levels vitamin past. matter much time spend outside (in South Carolina). pale skin save me. must something genetic kids too. tested terribly low levels without supplements. Sorry, didn’t mean question fact. asking people think cause is. Especially since many things factor illnesses Haha. pretty confused there. 

I’m gonna claim hypothesis try present definitive something. another *possible* explanation interesting take heard. would’ve ruled well- I’ve seen info thing go anecdotal experiences covid characteristic many times point I’m gonna rule either. Maybe weather? got much warmer week Maybe create happy Covid news sub. Sort like nightly network news broadcasts devote last segment night ""feel good stories"" instead actual new news information.

Already happening industry's behest without government mandate. get butts seats gearing holiday travel. Albeit certain destinations - like tourism stops. People wear masks hiking crazy One thing... positive rate week 26 (the week containing previous single day high) 10.18% - positive rate week 42 3.86% - that's big difference.

It’s not? Lies fake news Corporate Finance department. Quit bullshit. Either form sign says o.k placed behind mask wearers/people socially distancing medical care,and socialize similar belief.That could realistic middle ground (much hate trying find middle ground crazy,but future one.)  I’m sure figure something out. ""**As President** [**Donald **battles coronavirus, researchers reveal concerning new findings: Neurological symptoms occur 8 10 hospitalized** **patients.**

I've always assumed muscle pain goes hand hand fever chills, first time I've seen classed neurological symptom. Difference back local, spread bound get infected kinds things. new study, researchers analyzed charts 500 patients hospitalized COVID-19 within Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine health system. investigators identified neurological symptoms 42% patients COVID-19 symptoms surfaced, 63% patients hospitalized, 82% patients time course patients reported muscle pain -- 45% -- headaches -- 38%.

California's lockdown nowhere near strict cited: e.g. State Victoria Australia. latest lockdown (in response 671 cases day) included:

The night-time curfew implemented across Melbourne 20:00 05:00.

The valid reasons leaving home hours work, medical care care-giving.

Melbourne residents allowed shop exercise within 5km (three miles) home. Exercise outside home allowed one hour time.

Only one person per household allowed shop essentials 

A element lockdown state's domestic international borders sealed.

Nothing California - U.S. state done comes even close. lockdowns used China Vietnam tougher Victoria's.

I completely get coming from, I'm worried lot people would ignore it. UK introduced _£10000_ fines parties. insane amount money pay beers. None us would ever even consider party right? Yet police keep handing fines morons.

I read stat huge chunk (most?) lockdown-related fines issued UK police forces paid. That's think criminalise/penalise way it, least Western democracies. guess everyone going get plan lesser evil hoping celebrating suffering ""greater evil"", might bad guys here. want hope political side loses power things get done, fine. want people get sick die, piece shit. understanding lockdowns reducing case growth sustainable level, “hoping goes away”. case? Yes I'm asking daily deaths fully reopened Florida dropping restricted Minnesota rising? difference two states cases deaths per capita, articles state we're close enough herd immunity make impact. paper, Florida worse Minnesota, they? I'm thinking this, get 100k day soon much 100k due smaller population places like midwest compared places like TX, FL, NY, CA etc. 

Or least hope much 100k day. Ideally would far less, close zero possible, Yeah, mean get it. pretty satisfying see Trump half cabinet catch virus. every time someone dies, friends family lose forever. happened 225,000 Americans counting. consider news coverage they're getting FOX, telling shutdowns ruining country, *president* telling big deal, course they're going take seriously.

If 90% population deficiency 80% hospitalized patients do, deficiency might protective effect.

Almost everyone vitamin deficient outside summer period  Swiss healthcare mix private public insurance argument really work there. Haha! would least cut travelers covid, though catch all. would also cut knowingly travelling covid, unfortunately happening cases.

NYC good reason want this- they're huge flight hub. Orlando alone got rid like 30k tourism jobs like 3 weeks ago. people going jobs foreign tourists come back, happening long tourists trust florida keep virus control. example tho. 

But i'm saying director Pasteur-TheraVectys laboratory said TV long ago. Lot places hit hard first wave slower spread even far herd immunity, 20% population immune still large effect. Yeah right, point thing trump wants mandate another term live Key West, small community hospital.

Dr. Fauci said people health community concerned worried mask shortages health then, separate interview later, ""I regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people,"" Fauci told O'Donnell. yes. confused.  Fauci run information ""task force"" told to?  bad way look it.

Or Fauci CDC decide PPE shortages would occur therefore American public misled hoard it, even good?

Regardless anything. government official allowed give misleading statements public. give fucking statement. st Louis good example here? imagine much harder lockdown did. questions ridiculous! Personally, whilst conscientious washing hands etc. even though pretty good before, washing hands many times day complete overkill. work CRO people working microbiology even issue people overwashing hands much detriment skin health.

Its whole distancing thing. going avoid people much possible I'd grab 300 tins beans hibernate away foreseeable future. complete overkill. limit adjust social interactions appropriately without completely hiding away. hope put hands together help ~ people won’t wear mask stay home then. all. Better stop modifying exhausts don’t expect understand wanted flip little condescension back him. 

And he’s probably even American even worse gets see country get driven ground afar judge people resentful others enabled FDA, independent group analyze data time EUA requested. True, considering small village likely people participated wedding trying hide also there. Anyways, matter. wanted point out, primarily participant wedding reckless whole village. Yeah, thinking that. read thay 3rd well. I'm thrilled district going 100% remote January 28, possibly beyond.

But students? 

If position student living school district that's going online, I'd definitely get *very* beaten hopeless school's reopening date pushed farther farther back every time approaches. mental health, addition academic performance, would suffer considerably, would take *lot* counseling struggling get going again.

It's like Greek myth Sisyphus. Every time approaching liberation suffering, getting close finish line, boulder slips hands comes tumbling bottom hill again. exactly death found hospitalisations, see [this first column current hospitalisation age distribution, second column current ICU, third age distribution released hospital since beginning (ie, survivors), fourth death since beggining. virus agressive towards younger generations, show data : 45% hospitals 80, 85% 60.

Everyone them. also defending ACB based ""experience"" even though issue experience extremism. tells lot believe. scientist. political beliefs seem center-right. concerned factual knowable, seem think things win they're hard rules - barriers ideological project run against. wrong. 

But hey - we're going convince one another. I'm hardcore pro-union. able change opinion fundamentally different views unions. I'm socialist believes unions working class exercises power. Chicago Teachers Union refusing even discuss going back in-person classes workers (teachers) decided, they're fighting for. is, view, good itself. 

You, however, believe bad. Things done Facts^tm Logic^tm. take guess, believe there's responsible ways teachers students go back school, there's still risk. people involved need take risk that's is. 

I believe teachers, exercise power union. Simple as. didn’t pretend representing researchers claim. presenting reasonable conclusion could drawn data. strong, still conclusion doesn’t look great anti-maskers. it, time announce lockdown, late already. One, using anecdotal evidence prove point, rather utilizing scientific evidence one demanding first place. know right is...

1) Kids ages 10-18 likely good drivers infection young adults are. Lots theories this, studies (particularly Korean study) demonstrate likely true statement.

2) know COVID-19 likely airborne special circumstances, enclosed spaces prolonged exposure, there's inadequate ventilation air handling. circumstances present schools. 

3) schools New York Times focuses schools areas low community transmission. areas high community transmission, state refuses allow schools release data, pressuring heavily release data. school admins areas pressuring parents go test simply quarantine. 

To say authority schools drivers pandemic false; drivers community transmission low, Isreal showed high community transmission virus explode control school settings. Also, Texas session months now, multiple outbreaks here, numbers continue climb you, state local governments actively suppressing numbers way possible can, school districts also desperately attempting keep numbers shut lose funding. 

And no, I'm insulting you. I'm stating person touts believe science works field virology know better use anecdotal evidence make sweeping general statements. Another thing worth noting people anti-social care others obviously going gravitate toward anti-mask, automatically mean anti-mask people anti-social. 

I'm opposed mask mandates due mental side effects come them. I'm opposed lockdowns I'm sympathetic working class people disproportionately affected them. people oppose purely selfish reasons mean do.

Likewise there's lot people support mask mandates lockdowns purely selfless reason preventing COVID deaths, people support selfish reasons (Masks coping mechanism body image issues, lockdowns collect unemployment checks stay inside without FOMO, moral superiority, etc). mean everyone supports lockdowns selfish. They're toast. nice knowing you, England Really interesting piece history. However, covid isn’t yet. symptoms have? got sore arm. marking territory? needs resign. failed leadership covered blood covid im germany hospitals capacity covid.

Actually, week 26 tested 75,151 people (PCR) week 42 tested 148,267 (PCR)- that's 50.7%, 40%.

Also, positive rate 10.2% 12% week 22, week 42 3.86%. don’t like people still wear mask. paying it? 1st threshold 32 cases? more? No, understand.

Trumps base pro-fascism. wish worst. you’re putting unnecessary obstacles way happiness, make anti-lock point. Get roommate, move family. Everyone sacrificing special. don’t think so. mom ER nurse doesn’t get it. doesn’t wear face mask face shield times. they’re anyway.

The face mask shield pre-COVID policy people didn’t get flu shot. hasn’t changed COVID. people can’t get vaccine.  socially distancing anti-social. doublespeak real. think key issue (as many people pointing out) many cases governments providing people support need stay home, saying ""stay home deal it"". work long-term many people without help pay rent, buy food, etc., particularly people things like service-related industries either/or cannot work home/have seen entire industry evaporate. think lot people cost-benefit analysis point, ""do end poor house family"" ""do risk maybe keep income coming in""... I'm going pass judgement philosophies best way go, understand people desperate. Im pretty callous, sometimes hostile, occasionally flat deceitful, always wear mask right, I've exaggerating little claimed ""everyone"" (in 1,400-people-village, swiss-style democracy, that's everyone ;)) Equity. Private schools opened SF one month. think depends lot culture region question, regions people live cities drive economy stay home cases spike even required might helped little even without travel restrictions, travel regions still limited Sweden. anything, problem summer holidays.

Also community spread almost Sweden, like infected traveler going introduce virus previously untouched region. Sweden aiming flatten curve rather trying eliminate virus completely. That’s good know. wonder common people get sick traveling then...??? wonder keeps maintaining filtration system..seems like many planes I’ve flown pretty old. Hampshire et al, 2020.

Ohio’s rising cases lot rural counties taking enough (if any) preventative measures stop it. Simple that. saying it’s propaganda implication took away head means everyone wearing mask “bad person”

No, I'm saying propaganda part intented takeaway. propaganda far would designed elicit emotional response either side. study trite - let's think - people antisocial less likely things others. paper published study showing mask wearing correlated lower testosterone I'm sure would agree that1 whilst might true still basically saying can’t discuss legitimate findings plain language

No I'm not. I'm talking it. I'm talking used make people controlled. actually done demonstrated thread meant people unable talk civilly someone like perceive conforming therefore Bad Person. thing facts caring feelings?

 clear, change anything I'm sure will, wear mask public locations I'm asked do. use sunscreen? Never late change! I'll keep saying it: best become comfortable ensuring protection (and care about, already lost Orange Infant messiah already), that's got rely sure. Get solid mask **your** protection -not shit cloth one, eyeware bulky still foam surround such. People want self destruct, that's choice. Probably get stares occasional comment; problem making effort bankrupt family medical bills contributing chances dying alone hospital bed gasping air. 
Might well keep bear spray handy too, since matter time run next psycho defecating store, coughing / spitting you. people masks finally got pealed away ugly there. pisses end, like media wanting best getting clicks inciting panic things never get better they'd never get clicks-

Oh yea forgot that's pretty much it. didn’t, choose live alone. Hey, flu bro. Best day start mask usage 23rd January, second best day start mask usage today. Well sure bodes well vaccine. thanks friend😁👍🏻

This counting death negative outcome.  I've started wearing p100 half-face respirator (gvs elipse) store. see many noses sticking masks lately figure folks wear mask properly care respirator makes feel uncomfortable? clearly prioritize safety. (Naturally, wear cloth mask top, cover exhale valve).

I definitely felt awkward wearing mask early March traveling. way destination one. way back week later, feel silly. reporters blanket applying new Oct 9 guidelines Thanksgiving.

Eating outside one thing restaurant surrounded strangers sounds like would meet barn, get close one another leave right eating. Restrictions gradually end people get vaccinated. Especially since high risk older people risk hospitalization death, they’re receiving vaccine first. group vaccinated alone bring cases deaths.

It doesn’t make sense vaccinated people wear masks social distance six months year getting vaccine. scientific point view, even know vaccine effective you’re still making people wear mask social distance? social point view, point vaccine get back normal. would people get vaccine there’s reward, continue sacrificing, year waiting vaccine get back sacrificed? 7 years mentally older Biden now.

The initial blame China. I’m arguing that. Nobody is. it’s stupid keep harping point ignoring every major country continuously fucking situation up, ten months later. 

For fuck’s sake, US made wearing masks vaccines political ploy. senate adjourned laughing economic support. president telling people it’s big deal let control life, meanwhile US 20% global deaths 5% population. 

Damn near countries anything stem outbreak.

The thing find interesting ones post loopy posts extreme sides political divide. also interesting see similarities posts clearly they're agenda's driven sew discord.

And yes sanity I've removed blocked loops feeds. always hear stories, actually go airport get plane, 100% people barely anything. 

Most nothing. 

Don’t notice that? Like don’t feel like odd guy out? Doesn’t frustrate little?

Literally everybody’s barely wearing cloth mask hanging face. It’s joke. 

And American Airlines literally hands water crackers people get plane. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

And drink service twice first class economy. 

I mean entire thing makes fucking sense whatsoever. Encouraging people remove masks multiple times flight. don’t understand humanity anymore.

So, wear mask hope vaccine?

As people evicted desperation grows required work large groups, see sensationalist media, villainizing anyone ready return work. got source that?

There's also small clear increase number Covid-19 patients admitted intensive total 55 people treated Covid-19 intensive care Monday – 15 percent patients intensive care, according latest official ""We're starting approach critical point Sweden well,"" said number intensive care patients still low compared spring, 500 Covid-19 patients ventilators peak, doubled past week majority Sweden's regions expect current situation deteriorate.

 So, 500 spring, went 25 50 recently.  bad.. great.

 I'm sure I'd call near ""critical point"". eat lot paint chips kid? working CBS broadcasting teams COVID control would test 48hrs landing every new location. 

While education topic would correlate saying, turn plenty positives within 48hrs transportation, practice, may less time. virus arrived January. secret officials. much ignorance intense denial. People terrified dying, white Americans particular used whatever want whenever want. thought relinquishing entitlement help people unbearable some. even freedom point, actively endangering others. I'm sick death (lol) COVID I'm still wearing masks distancing. do, however, handful friends see person without mask (I live alone) live low transmission city, people even find *that* atrocious. odd seeing cities people straight give fuck. No. science back masks panacea everything.

Masks help. won’t solve everything.

The fact discussion proves point. People taken science masks help masks solve everything. love Halloween candy pumpkin bucket wearing mask. also like statues wear masks. helps normalise universal masking!  Friday Yet look downvotes adding one wants hear it.  scientists stop playing god

Do know doctors? know doctors. fucking *grim*. Completely irrelevant issue hand. cannot say one thing past wrong, therefore, everything wrong. evaluate policy's merit own, dismiss hand something wrong before. appear dismiss policy wrong without evaluating evidence science behind it.

Also, US FDA. AABB also supports deferral. countries advanced LGBT rights still similar restrictions too. that? LGBT rights, patient safety. Blood banks cannot, not, sacrifice patient safety make LGBT group feel better themselves. pretty interesting trial published late August suggests treatment Vitamin megadose led improved study used metabolite Vitamin bioavailable. Either way results impressive terms suggesting Vitamin direct effect COVID outcomes. see two extreme possibilities? Nothing middle, world we're going die, might long road ahead us life goes back way was, need strong, cautious, considerate others?

Saying might need wear masks practice social distancing another year doom gloom, risk-averse wanting people die unnecessarily. hope change presidency mask mandate nationwide day one. state defying receive federal funding. individual cooperating fined first two times jailed. past point putting petulant infants serious measures need taken. USA much freedom. Ah no, actually Florida. Look, know Americans hate educated people, seriously, dawg, get clue. They're hired babysitters, hence Ameriduhs around country demanded even threatened school boards open schools. Ya wants strive better. wants properly running society long make dollars. 

I personally take yearly income country one best world nearly metrics. Yep that. Although sanitizing hands touching straps prolly fine. back full normal? Federally no, could see shutdowns happening state/city level fucking hate motherfuckers still wear mask. going take year vaccine make real significant difference.

Anyone real world business experience knows this. 1..Our government fucked..
2.. states trying.. can't beat people refuse listen. system exactly? lot things together.

Virus spread rampant summer amongst youngsters. going back school/business September. Somehow trying go back kind half normal life (but masks everywhere). Well, take public transportation, eat colleagues office, perhaps work meetings see customers, one point gonna see friends family, youngsters go high school, etc. shit starts spreading more, government says hey guys take care. incomfortable level: wave cold humidity. Appears virus loves it. second wave. Technically, lot pharmaceutical companies trying first market since make ton money. ""The medical field"" entity.

There's absolutely nothing wrong cautious vaccine rushed market emergency authorization. Bullshit. careful otherwise Trump fire him. Fauci walking thin line behind protecting American people (with hands behind back) passing Trump. I’ve learned hear message behind message. means “this shit ridiculous” kind people scheduled surgery surgeon told eat anything eat giant meal right before. 

Only throw anesthesia aspirate lots vomit goes unnoticed long nearly die possibly admit error part. 

They'll probably still sue doctors though. still wont get flu vaccine.  thought Sweden model response covid according Trump fucks? Ha, yet.

Also, gets real complex control keep controlling consider people work / support NYC actually live, goods come from, things go to. wife’s grandmother died nursing home (Michigan). unexpected covid. didn’t get see family last several months life. Really crappy way go out. extent 86ing people refuse comply. Agreed No. Sent repair, took 4 days got back today. 

They changed whole top case feels 100% new also changed battery perfectly fine quite cycles it. speakers blasted therefore also changed sound good again! 

If go days without it, it! free since known problem specific models. Make sure covered.

I'm still disappointed Apple issues first place, first Macbook held 7 years without single issue, given second chance. mean salon? Closing saloons good idea they're inside. That's true, he'll definitely bunch shit make worse Biden may turning point American Coronavirus response! kissed? :) Lol what? Deaths state vs total population come number similar closer IFR. Deaths population vs number infected = CFR. CFR base accurately reflect number people actually infected, large number people wont get tested, cant get tested, experience little symptoms. people arent listed CFR, tout claim like 5100 people state 11.7 million, thats true number. number people need concerned with.

CFR IFR. Thats it. metric **should** fall within 2 numbers number (positive cases, hospitalizations, etc) doesnt matter. Case Fatality Ratio Infected Fatality Rate. far, CFR bad, really look IFR, even less that.

So look raw numbers, sensationalist fearmongering headlines like EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND NEW CASES OMG. ignoring reality logistics manufacturing distributing vaccine.

You tell folks actual business experience. Strangely enough, also essence modern Conservatism. inability empathise anyone like them. someone’s who’s married retail worker, stories like scare shit make lose sleep night. 

I hope go jail rest lives looking seem sharpest tools shed. immune, close harmless transmit much. Here's another, immediate thought too. walks park friends? know people said allowed one bubble person look Paris city limits, tiny

If compare Manhattan, much similar population, much denser sub comprised many people. kindly leave. lil babby mean, supposed stay home, right? Fuck dodgers everyone knows someone that’s dead

Not even remotely true. live major metropolitan area don’t even know anyone who’s it. America bad though right? science back up

Perhaps word differently? see public health measures continuing maybe month two vaccine released public

You're thinking remotely big enough. Esp. 2 shots needed, ""released"" public near end next summer. 

Public health measures us summer '22. Thank fuck im farmer Yeah, NYers Californistas crapped COVID-19. See Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, New Jersey, Ohio..... Every year progressively worse since 2013 lol went first place income taxes.    'Well, duh' - marge simpson reading B-D posting. B-D wrong, answers correlate point.

They saying compare Florida US states open up, Florida CURRENTLY better economically. understand correctly, point money moving around FL economy state locked down.

I agree contend B-D wrong boost they've seeing temporary best. long term damage done opening dramatically cut long term growth. like sprinter distance runner competing 5k. sprinter takes couple laps opens lead, lap 4-5, sprinter struggling continue distance runner cruises right past top speed. I'm antisocial wear mask. guard's job.  said opposite guy said. wear masks = real life alignment table? get someone this? ""We're gonna sell time share never go back.""

Boo hoo lady, try telling guy ventilator. Sounded entitled, kinda glad allowed though think lol. not. Shocking teaching hazard pay profession, especially since sign trial covid fire. goes show little huge swath public values public education. think teachers little shift working-baby sitters expendable replaceable. state public education US 2020, reflects sad sociopolitical psyche worst. like visiting Paris, could never imagine living there. know people put it. many big cities Europe would much prefer live in.

The south spectacular, though — many people told go Marseille, personally loved it. heart, however, always stayed Dordogne, favorite region country.  also somewhat precaution - one knew bad going get. plateaued did, would've run beds April. early April definitely looked like field hospital going necessary. guard, don’t talk unless gun. Even look wages first. buying either. 

From article: ""Jessica Hill allegedly pulled knife back pocket began stabbing man, Jayla Hill held place hair.""

I know you, physically restraining someone sibling stabs *definitly* sounds like self-defense.

Enough places test 12 (or late 11) shouldn’t issue. book one Canada $300 Florida ~~a~~ hotile ~~workplace~~ Glad live place assholes like fined shitty attitude. work visa revoked repeat offence.  Guess that’s new COVID cases 1’s 2’s vs stupidly high numbers US. true story. friends live got kicked car dealership service centre requesting person dealing wear mask, banned store result. 

these aggressive people - older Americans trying stay safe. 

Shame every person contributing fiasco. watched Netflix documentary say Newsweek. know mods blocked yet. stabbing TWENTY SEVEN TIMES REASONABLE reaction grabbing phone PRIVATE property asked abide property’s rules?

I mean, technically guard shouldn’t grab phone, going completely bat-shit trying kill man reasonable response way. Yeah, that’s something wrote somewhere else. article makes sound like started stabbing requested put masks, sounds like escalated violent tried stop filming grabbing phone.

I’m saying excuses anything course, paints little bit complete picture. Jesus, man... Tissues, sock! “If there's 90% effective vaccine 30% people take it, net result barely better crappy assed 50.1% vaccine.”

Technically true society, 90% effective vaccine still 90% effective choose take individual level. don’t accepting risks serious COVID-19 infections. I’m keeping lifestyle hillbilly doesn’t believe science.

“The idiots really going fuck us one.”

No, going fuck themselves. 2020 20/20. Ah, see. Thanks. Hey now. thought firefighters sitting asses playing cards day /s like stupid shot lies past line. That's leadership looks like. wonder it’s moms blamed this... Yea, extremely serious. Hospitals overflowing deadly consequences.

But ""everyone die"" strong statement like virus hates racism won’t get infected protests? eck wrong people? horrifying. suppose would better NYC economically implementing 14 day quarantine arrival states countries require. Except masks proven stop droplets, really false sense. goes herd immunity method ‘People Going Die Virus. That’s Truth’ - Andrew Cuomo real problem hospitalizations areas hardest hit. El Paso literally run beds ordered curfew. DFW also averaging anywhere 11 15% given day, really matter time DFW reaches level El Paso. bad cases, ICU resources starting stretch thin. Omg finally admitted you’re wrong. It’s damn miracle. til point refusing read/acknowledge evidence instead twist one particular statement Fauci made. Point is; anyone doesn’t comply selfish. dude (whom blocked toxicity/harassment) admitted he’d rather see one hundred people die could go sporting event. word selfish Toronto-area hospitals nearing 100 per cent capacity grapple COVID-19 cases patients. guess would since prepared pandemic physically impossible scale testing resources. job done lol well one way shut up, reckon. 4 cases schools Montgomery township School district NJ. due superintendent calls effective contact tracing, elementary school case staying open hybrid learning, high school going virtual many teachers contact individual.

And am, paraprofessional kindergarten struggles staying six feet away kindergartner trouble masks always needing help.

The teachers edge here. really want go virtual would perfect scenario group testing. Swab passengers flight one group, virus detected deploy rapid tests individual passengers figure is.

It's weird people use inconvenience excuse literal life death situation. may get creative things, still **need** done **save lives**. complete fucking willfully ignorant, inconsiderate, rude idiot, boot! u/FlameBoyantYT Rounding turn.. [soon use lot seemingly legal terms without understanding them. may want hire people heart conditions still lawful pre-employment blood tests FDA approved statin drugs regardless reason given. That's insane. people thing told do. I'm sorry people. happy see grandma grandpa. course are, USA fucking stupid right thing. 

Well good portion USA is. wave Oceana. appalled response sides atlantic. least fulfilled dream seeing world series pandemic hotspot.

That's living life FullesT. Deaths take surpass March April. US would need ~150k cases day see kinds numbers. trend happen mid December. haven’t seen phone book 15 years Holding steady boys. Ain't sad truth. logistics alone make pointless. Unless get tests give accurate result minutes, prevent anything. data showing influenza suppress voting. sick, less likely wait line vote. imagine Republicans sick right now. may real impact. arbitrary discrimination illegal?

Lol. Meaningless phrase.  wearing mask isn’t protected class. There’s arbitrary discrimination work here. see weird hardon phrase “find reason” OPs comment doesn’t make less legal hire person. Sorry. You’re wrong. Posting 20 times doesn’t make different. Yes sir. one per shift thing isn’t everyone (and it’s every shift either, depends doing), sure beats April running rooms full people infected brand new disease didn’t understand wearing week old N-95.... lucky. ""false sense security"" /s mean folks screamed ""The Bars Open!"" Ever's stay home order overturned spring? I've said saying again: Number cases cannot compared spring numbers, due huge differences testing. Back then, hospitals critical jobs (e.g. medical staff) tested, adults symptoms easily get tested.

As example misleading graph is: metrics (hospitalizations, ICU admission, reported deaths, excess mortality) clear peak actually April, steadily decreasing least August. 

Your graph makes look like peak June, actually June testing finally ramped somewhat decent levels.

So, cases probably rising lot faster back March/April, data back nowhere near enough testing. Exactly point. always suggest right wing friends move somewhere truly right wing. even offer pay find way get there. Surprisingly, *one* taken offer! I'm like ""you're right-wing paradise right there, plane ride away! want go?""
 
Turns no, none actually want live like get pretend do. 

Also, helpful resources depict spike hospitalizations facing:

[Total currently hospitalized broken region - broken region - per provides alarming picture headed (Midwest especially look per capita). especially concerning considering haven’t hit full winter yet. mean that's straight-up even true. He's certainly benefited Saudi Arabia lot say benefited Russia totally crazy. one example Congress passed massive economic sanctions Russia refused enforce them. Post partum abortionists likely avoid whatever shit bird, Trump, Putin, bolsonaro, etc want end day they’re saying happen yes. agree maybe mask distance vaccine? Yeah probably that’s happen you’re directly trying confront covid. general sense, think secondary issues it’s causing plunge mental health across globe etc, wont play like that. Oh Shit! afraid losing job? 

I feel like he's high could get position wanted idiot fired talking science.

Or quiet knows he's one standing trump disinformation. seriously?! talk clickbait, article ridiculous Businesses open, mean I’m shutdown hospitals overwhelmed time reopen Europe! thing though everyone follows rules. businesses/stores/shops lenient mask usage. top people violating social distance private gathering rules taking things extreme. College schools also reopened also factor truth universal mask usage social distancing would lead Europe’s especially Frances numbers, people fucking up, en masse. People think anymore? we're sheep? Lol Still taking it. want thought go heads “Maybe I’m selfish asshole, people hate me?” We've got 250 Million people go (I really know numbers, lot people left go). “bUt dOnT wAnT tO” Europe 27 countries EU alone country different rules guidelines. incredibly absurd. year makes feel like I'm living twilight zone. Yep, that's GF started spike flu, taking risks now. solve lawyer problem: lose case share penalty accused. 

You’d make damn sure truly innocent instead spinning BS fatten wallet. sister's friend high school told March 14-year old stepbrother (living florida) died COVID. internet shouted 14 year olds died COVID Florida.

Well, officially guess. Lol. I’m wrong agree experts. Makes sense /s true. 50% flu cases asymptomatic. may well spread it.  nothing gain it. oops. things looking swell. used gun feel terrible people right thing. say stay safe, try isolate, work home possible, wash hands good old strong bar soap (not bottle gel perfume crap), stay away people much possible right now. think vaccine coming soon, I'm going listen Fauci. says safe effective, I'll take it. Hes bully like that. Idaho, deny children medical care, point death, charged absolutely nothing, long claim religion made it.

Many states same.

So no, probably child abuse case.

And yes, child abuse.

But end, children chattel property parents USA, fact Americans seem perfectly fine that.

Americans care much child abuse care culturally inappropriate child abuse. fine types. Dang old alt? ""We listen called experts.""

Kristi Noem Give em Mississippi Exactly.  Store guards cattle prod selfish deplorables. going answer... people going believe him...

- army never deployed enforce people staying home. deployed build temporal hospitals clean areas.

- Spanish growing ratio among lowest Europe. sounds like miracle considering guys statements check 2nd wave started early July Spain. almost 5 months running. 

If things guy suggesting, Spain would already imploded.

Growth linear (which means infection badly controlled completely control) almost European countries exponential growth... big 1.5 months (since 2nd wave started there) much worse numbers Spain.

- speaking region region. Almost Spanish regions able contain previous outbreaks implementing mild measures. check region region historical data actually suggest Spain certain experience lowering numbers without dramatic measures.

I'm saying Spain performing awesomely well. not.

They performing bad. currently performing better European countries. don’t need 100% compliance improve situation, - it’s less effective, OP saying 100% compliance would virtually erase virus country. What? pretending schools biggest source transmission? researchers found 82 per cent hospitalized COVID-19 patients (who taking supplements) vitamin deficient, 47 per cent control group deficiency. Lol interesting response something never said. okay. Surveys accepted, certainly, although also recognized fairly weak subject tremendous limitations. 

However, never objected use survey.

The stated objective question **assess adherence** various measures. 

If we’re going use survey assessment, ask something fact reveals something respondent’s adherence various measures, right? 

So want know someone *adheres* requirement/law/best practice X, makes sense ask: X? 

And similar questions directed toward individuals actions regarding X. 

If objective assess **opinions** requirement/law/best practice X, makes sense ask: think important X? 

Do see distinction? 

If stated goal assess action, ask questions actions. 

If stated goal assess opinion, ask questions opinion. 

If stated goal assess actions, ask questions opinions, you’re practicing junk science. Anti-social behavior defined hostility towards others, open otherwise. asocial means adverse social situations, tend avoid them. Though anxiety panic attacks public could also something else. Says European American website, using American operating system, American internet. depends 100% is, supplements often treat 400IU daily dose, insufficient amount, 600% 2400IU, much. need crazy levels vitamin overdose. One political party decades interested expanding consolidating power serving people. Condolences family. Tragic story NBC news get shit together report facts made available instead using word apparently. one social study actually didn’t seem obvious me...I honestly would expected opposite. Generally find people introverted quiet generally thinking constantly something assessing outcomes coming conclusion. reserved accept things tentatively investigation. distracted opinion. people disagree necessity wearing masks survey. Serious question worked mental health field?

Humans *wired* able think foresee bad things happening hard time visualizing possibilities good things happening. literally anxiety, depression.

This weird subreddit feature phenomena seen widely.

In fact, thinking things good face evidence contrary seen people several disorders gambling risk taking. see another scratch-off probably win jackpot feel small shred possibility greater factor. comply found obedient, easily manipulated, probe call cancel culture might important individual basis - people recover flu fine.

It’s like fire extinguisher kitchen - people fine decades without one, use pot lid baking soda small incidents - people really ought one either cook lot careful. don’t think extinguisher stove important unless know someone lost kitchen house grease fire. that’s likely. still think CNN anchors testing positive virus. complicated news, actually.

It's good vaccine coming along, issuing emergency use authorization implications completion trials (both Pfizer's many efforts).

Here's [good talks issues. left Texas 8 years ago still friends Austin Beaumont. Beaumont friends say nobody wears mask thinks still hoax. One guy timeline still posting 0% influenza admission rates numbers fake.

So every doctor entire world conspiring? people say believe conspiracy theories can't keep secret many people. comment officer Covid19 air I’m trick treat year Covid-19. Last year didn’t trick treat 30. Clearly there’s enough proof 100% define relationship left that. You’re literally asking commit confirmation bias skip conclusion might there. Anecdotal evidence evidence use make legitimate claim. might see lot people say they're re-infected remember around 10% cases long haulers. include people who's symptoms go away period come back. 

Also, bear mind people posting symptoms sub /r/COVID19positive heavy selection bias.

I agree confirmed cases reinfection restrictive evidence. However, we'd seeing *something* mass amounts presumed reinfection happening. don’t comply Covid-19 containment measures also found small pp. Fake. would trust Pfizer Oxford point, Pfizer 44K trial participants Oxford &lt;30k. Great film. Agree terrible acting. good ideas. It’s meaningless conclusion. biased reputable journal would discard it. Anyone reads science papers tell that. sub “pro-science” guys sure post lot shaky conclusions unsubstantiated claims large portion population pretends anti-social traits quirky, cute personality. mean people finally going admit anti-social tendencies bad mental health? sure hope so. Lmao someone give person award. would im damn broke thanks to...well know said assholes assholes pandemic correlate?

2) chrio fucking clue what’s going CoVID19, aren’t physician shouldn’t portray setting. That's high school starting yesterday.
Elementary middle schools opened mask rule seated.

Brusaferro today (head italian CDC) said clearly schools reopening major factor creating second wave. Yes, Sweden never attempted control virus. Therefore experienced deaths right front, whereas everyone else spreading deaths longer time window mitigation measures. really way judge way worked better over.  think will. Polis ""threatening"" stay-at-home order since August, even he's allowed (and congratulated) CU-Boulder, CSU, DU, K-12 schools open without many restrictions.

The East already roaring back normal West basic healthcare facilities overrun end sight. 47%. Meaning vitamin deficiencies 4x likely hospitalized without cases selfish asshole helps spread isn’t affected spreads good person die. It’s plain old top bottom shitfuckery. Thank 🙏🏼 berry good news. jus scienceing thinking That's questionable, probably differs lot countries. Slovenia, almost anti-maskers wear masks public, can't buy food (or anything else) use public transport without wearing one, wearing one street might get fined. people wear mask people lazy consistent, marginalized even know need wear one. next News, sky blue fire might hot understanding underreporting countries mentioned relative timespan little testing capacity emergency situation forced take extreme measures, example lockdowns countries.

In addition reporting excess deaths themselves.. exactly purpose providing proper numbers given impossiblily count deaths time.

Or example French government claims numbers new cases probably double reporting now. Nope. adopted perfect measures schools study shows infections happen there. Anyway, many regions schools totally closed some, students attend 25% physical classes. doctor recommended 1000 IU day deficient. 3 months Im back normal still taking 1000 IU day. 60000 IU get kidney stones hypercalcemia Guess I'm antisocial thought  Assuming correlation anti-X beliefs likelihood anti-X behavior (a) unreasonable (b) challenge ""credibility."" basically accusing intentional academic dishonesty. accused overstating significance findings.

But kind think arguing sake arguing point. Headlines New Zealand like reading another planet right now. 

Everywhere else basically garbage fire they're like ""oops, one snuck net, we'll get taken care right away."" thought anti- social meant - hating around bunch people. like mini panic attacks stay Walmart long. think confused - gyms closed, live music industry shut down, speech therapist, etc. many peoples livelihoods outlawed missing point. majority blue countries map either oppressive regimes failed states. reasonable country criticised Hong Kong security law.

Choosing support USA lesser two evils me. would rather USA leading world backwards communist dictatorship lead malevolent prick looks like disney cartoon character possible Macron, indeed European leaders, know lockdowns way stop virus spreading, go motions trying everything else (while hospitalisations deaths rise) order gather political mandate get done.

This helped vociferous denialist/defeatist contingent - words actions enter lockdown later, costing lives, longer, causing economic damage. See done, ready hold account finally over. Depends election goes...if Dems take senate white house I'd count seeing healthy stim package. get Bob Doug McKenzie put thinking toques. seeing Americans following advise invade Taiwan start firing military vessels South China sea, inevitable. first shot would theirs, see reacting viable option. There’s 9500 hospitalizations; 206 yesterday (which course like 550 since needed first 367 replace dead break even) 2 weeks Halloween. rapidly going time, dont care scores, reaction referring It’s great! far Covid stuff we’re second national lockdown (720 cases today 5 deaths) I’m happy right feel 100% safer US mean like Italy. locked got cases handful. don’t think St Louis locked harder effectively. time issue. kindergarden? 'You're dumb stupid person i'm smart brave'

I dont care keeping distance stranger, that's always case general throw fit wear mask store.

I however keep resisting call 'new normal' normal never be. dead body, that's become normal me.


The west destroyed economies. effects? people die poverty third world countries virus itselfs. one big domino effect. selfish aswell think people here. totally true virus care old are, make difference terms healthy person got sick looks like article shared. linked second article mentions origin worker. Yup.

And like denier they’ll turn real medicine things get bad.

But don’t enough real medicine everyone. Maybe finally become mature adult? could chip build McDonald's. 

That would cause problems, though, none would want *work* McDonald's, want go yell manager. everyone, everywhere. 
People don’t realize it. 
I neighbor goes terrible things Lysol disinfect everything. 
Not five minutes later inches away neighbors chatting away. 
I don’t get closer 10-15 feet, possible. Takes lot call one narcissist whilst sitting gloating second wave happening(which never said wouldnt happen), fairplay. case anyone cares, big news removing ""new individuals tested"" category reports way accurately gauge true positivity rate. way FL DoH reports positivity rate includes thousand duplicate negative results duplicate positives (when long term care providers get tested multiple times course work, example). 

So, guess get know watered positivity rate point forward. Even Johns Hopkins' report follows new individuals tested vs. tests, knowledge. That's percent positive much higher compared DoH. Lol anyone whines downvotes absolute tool. Especially you’re still plus 9 comment you’re whining Wow one article trumps evidence thousands daily flights? Lol, shut fuck coward. I’m gonna take vaccine soon it’s injected instantly die, I’m going haunt wrath million untested vaccines. clearly relationship tho based data. hesitant come say Vitamin helps fight Covid? know true Fake N95s tie back. likely California larger number infection beginning knew covid was. case, much harder virus spread asked source, got one saying:

""People stubborn holding onto one thing said""

He's scientist he? lied people. Admitted lying. people wondering people ""denying science"". Well asshats like this. I'm shocked many people can't stand him.

Don't bring Trump it. thread chain about.. got great answer people like him. like it, that's another matter least educated WHY. people like health officials economical truth. They're weird like ;) survival rate way greater 99.7, we're clear. Current Best Estimate IFR per CDC:

Yes, Virus impacts everyone, one immune, age drastically, health affects impact you, young, healthy, preexisting conditions, chances dying incredibly low. like 80+ multiple preexisting conditions, chances dying rise significantly 1%. think standard infection control protocols ""real life ridiculousness"", part problem.. solution. Human beings think human beings, especially immunocompromised vulnerable virus? Inconceivable! drink, make sure bottle handy one. 


Take shot every time actor inappropriate emotional response situation they're words 

They fucking dickheads Honestly everything pretty much back normal. We’re still ‘level 1’ ready move back levels need be. outbreak again, likely starting ports believe, enough contact tracing control straight after, city appropriately put mini lockdown. cases point people flying country managed isolation. yeah, don’t really see many people wearing masks anymore, social distancing etc encouraged sign app pen paper go shop place. concerts festivals going ahead, life pretty much back normal besides international travel! Dude, sounds great hot summers Facebook , that's what. exceptions. 1% Category. It’s really WWII analogy... define metrics tolerability. that, path vaccine.

If 500,000+ US deaths tolerable, wouldn’t even conversation, things would normal.

I suspect 100,000 is, goal endpoint bringing COVID within number. is, we’re back normal. passes science now? kind leadership top guide fools. inclined believe think, sounds horribly rude point something like this. People dying stressed out, try considerate writing types comments (considering trolls infest Sweden-related posts). believe validity Swedish strategy - better support structure elderly beginning would even argument. probably would level Finland. looking immortality, trying keep loved ones safe, especially ones health conditions, base level respect people around me.

Believe not, us ability think well people. thought “definitely safe”? still standing talking dangerous flight? wars, economic policies political policies made West fall. simply populace automatically thought acted masks important plague.

Masks bit symbolic here. Masks important... lose importance super-spreader businesses open. Like bars. Restaurants clubs filled brim people. Yep. China government literally force everyone overseas quarantine hotel rooms 14 days test everyday, pay cost. Good. time stop trying tell people put lives hold start getting tools need safe. true Lombardy's main industry tourism, sole city Milan 7.5M tourists 2019 bracing 8 2020. year final number expected around 3.5M, likely revised lower point. alone 3-5B € loss income. add lakes region provinces talking 2/3 times that. all, roughly 3% decrease PIL region alone. 

It definitely applies.  science clear, working?

Perhaps mistaking clear hypothesis clear science. water wet... posted above, bad (and IMHO bigger news) Long Covid may actually turn Lifetime Covid. 

I'll put way - I, thankfully, contracted COVID yet (to knowledge, course). had, one long haulers, hoping every day would get better truly back normal, heart would absolutely broken upon reading story. fair it’s quote school officials announced. Nursing homes come Tuesday Friday last three weeks least. Last Tuesday reported 100 nursing home deaths, Friday 114. Trust science Oh yes, medical tyranny. thought freedom die murica! think so, wear VoC cartridge basically cannot smell anything all. Asian countries, govts issuing clear directions wear masks plus Asian countries went SARS that's big reason they're taking seriously. problem Europe came lockdown, acted like virus eradicated stopped wearing masks social distancing. remember article bus driver France murdered asking rider wear mask getting bus. article featured photo family funeral, course, wearing masks. saying bankers know less redditors motivations different?

Comical.  mistake, went back reread original comment. agreement lax standards. many businesses closed, unemployment, huge impact economy

These things already happening result ""Control measures"" Forreal lol fuck going peoples heads. Risk assessment whack. Probably never thought much driving car (much dangerous covid 15-34) pandemic. Read article. treatments Lupus autoimmune diseases promising. sure transparency present challenges near term. it’s worth mentioning states struggling, states like Mass, Utah, Vermont New Jersey already released solid plans state level. provide credible legit source FDA swayed media? FDA organizations? Simple yes no

It yes, go ahead provide that

If no, admit pulled ass Oh come on, like enough interest New England Journal Things I've Heard? ""Has ever randomised control trial efficacy parachutes? somebody think silkworms!""

Yes: Time move Florida lots empty houses. mask clean dry. electrostatic filtration degrades mask soiled. people need cautious much reuse masks Internet ridiculousness less embarrassing real life ridiculousness. me. time I’m urban crowded area going forward I’ll wearing one matter Problem magnesium, Americans issues fat intake. ;) smh. every goal goalpost. Really? seems like majority sentiment deaths *do* lag hospitalisations though. problem gets control like closed schools also many businesses closed, unemployment, huge impact economy well... deaths.

Along 5 major studies. quite intellectual weasel. say infer claim do. assuming outcome study hoping nobody reads link. works deplorables, majority Americans still value integrity. going fucking destroy GOP 7 days.  reason would stop going anytime soon? is. Lol Nursing homes reported twice week. bad trajectory though. nursing homes places extensively protecting. saw happened last time. Israel top ally insane independent streak, far I've heard; know get away support matter political ideology America. said, even makes sense they'd still something secretive, like Mossad.  familiar politics, would producing much vaccine prior completion trials create pressure use even results aren’t great? Sadly suspect ""masks violate rights"" crowd protesting province (Ontario) going particularly moved lessons advice PM health officials point. Never understood news outlets running ""Second Wave"" narrative.

Dr Fauci consistently said still beginning Pandemic's first wave.

He's never said anything contrary. Yeah exactly. Lessons generally learnt one thinks wil happen them. “them” mean cities/countries/society etc well individuals. people think exception rule gonna get screwed and/or fck people Covid times. Keep inhaling common viral infections media swore going cause apocalypse unless locked inside 15...226 days counting. Wal-Mart Amazon really appreciate it, I'm sure! Better yet, hit gym stop whining testing *usually* mean *more cases*, given case person confirmed covid.

What mean deaths hospitalizations, seeing right now.

I wish that, debate, would asked Trump terms hospitalizations instead cases, use testing cop-out. (Most people understand nuance looking things like test positivity rate, clearly show Trump lying, everyone understands hospitalization). crazy think next year time, probably wont restrictions anymore, masks may even gone time. every doctor entire world conspiring? people say believe conspiracy theories can't keep secret many people.

They're always right, everyone else always wrong. evidence they're wrong, fake made up. always used think people minority small one that. truly see humanity mostly awful disgusting. included look deep enough. Ahh didn’t think wearing stops car  treatment? isn’t good news. former supervisor tried get stop wearing mask saying “you know doesn’t even actually help right? people.” that’s bad thing control vs responsibility Hmm live Dublin capitol get pretty diverse bunch people loads international students world. However it’s pretty white outside Dublin least point bf (Irish) visited states one shocked diverse lived haha. It’s definitely smaller feel D.C considering 2016 Last Irish census ENTIRE island 6mill people troll? Sure said bit extreme hard blame one guy honestly think Trump handled Covid well? FDA made new rule press started pushing it. kind wonder lot “low hanging fruit” already wiped out... Maybe release study people don’t wear masks tend small penis, bad lovers multiple tabs open phones Justin Bieber. husband originally bought 3M half face respirators back late Feb/early March, find masks available go big stay home. First time wore them, got many stares laughs. 

Eventually since masks become available usually wear KN95s go anywhere (which try avoid all). I'm you, percent starting go up, I'm seriously considering going back 3M. reason think social; really sticks out. give rat's rear mocked, worry occasional violent nutjob. Kinda fun feeling like Vader, though. long state boarder still open, cases keep going up. work Pol gotta agree you. thinks it’s blown. thinks restrictions Poland put place terrible useless. sure gets news listened would think Poland didn’t single Covid case. really mattered entirety population would infected already. 

Get high horse, people buy large moved covid doesn’t impact majority us. Fine fuckers 50000 day every day comply. Fuck them. fair I'm also guessing Canadians gonna forget two months Christmas...

The big takeaway story reason believe issues suffered least COVID ""long-haulers"" well may end lasting lifetime. 

That's actually hugely horrifying, know fact treatments similar conditions may help make less frequent overall occurrence symptoms really lessens shitty is. Thats great news! people saying cold weather cause issue starting see now. 
 
People willing use safe guards. 
 
People relaxed tired virus now. going serious damage think point introducing changing rules might harm good. would set new round stupidity among simple minded. Japan’s work culture SK’s toxic corperation culture

Whereas dandy employee good old US A.... Probably muscle fine. /s question it? Better hand hygiene bad thing encouraged. inlaws early 70s, hear. They're ready go second needed. possible fomites significant means transmission *because* hand-washing emphasized start pandemic, way around? Found Rogan’s username That's big number. think nursing home values weekly though, right? really daily number, still large increase 298 last Tuesday. Probably 1) need take overdose one go huge, 2) taking much, takes long time start negative effect. People weird fixation binary good/bad surprising ""It's hard overdose D"" became ""You can't overdose D"". new study, scientists involved discovery water indeed wet substance. Keeps going up. Crazy times. Duh lmao circumstances come here. think they'd door-to-door campaign.

There three basic groups people. first people eager get shot. Healthy eager people go wherever need issue; get vaccine somewhere close let know there. 
 eager less mobile, yet situations similar people (nursing homes, group homes, prisons, etc), send nurse give vaccine on-site. problematic people particular group eager, live alone can't get around well. least them, I'd expect they'll nurse ride-alongs Meals Wheels. others vaccinated come contact healthcare system, expect least group overlooked left behind.

The second group people interested vaccine: either they're anti-vaxxers general, they're particular vaccine (the virus hoax, conspiracy, rushed, etc). way reach educational campaign. Expect see PSA's ads debunking common misconceptions pushing people get vaccinated. [Side note: would lovely vaccine one ones that's inhaled, would help people scared needles.]

Then there's third group: willing consider getting vaccinated, go way so. thing make extremely convenient get vaccinated. fully expect see drive-through vaccination set-ups schools, parents they're dropping picking kids. south midwest, surprised see vaccine van Church parking lot Sundays; may work Orthodox groups New Jersey well. Basically, find bunch people naturally going daily lives, go there.

&amp;nbsp;

Of concern vaccines need two doses work, work best second given certain point first. Making sure get second dose people time makes things trickier. it'll even harder keep track end competing vaccines.

An issue states small towns far apart issue keeping vaccines proper temperature administration; fortunately, that's issue New Jersey.

And final problem another education issue. threshold accepting vaccine right vaccine needs work 50% people given to, needs either reduce contagiousness, reduce symptoms, reduce death rate.

So going people get vaccinated think protects entirely. least doomed disappointment vaccine work everyone, others still get sick despite vaccine working - spread others, sick normally would been, they'll get sick die. they'll see got vaccine still got ill, clearly vaccine complete failure. much way flu vaccine days: designed reduce chances getting flu, make less severe get it, **so** many people think entirely useless ""still got flu"".  Right. advocating shutting entire fucking world economy forever sending tens [to hundreds millions brink starvation, feel little bit safer months virus spreads anyway, *totally* altruistic ones. Thank explaining it. Okay see. Makes sense. looks aged. feel sad Um people dying. fucking pandemic here. Everyone suffering here. Leave entitlement door please. Yes! want, get antibody test unblind yourself, can’t share results anybody trial. 

There ONE caveat however— I’m sure antibodies vaccine produces antibodies body produces natural virus. different, lab won’t know look vaccine-specific antibodies blood come back negative.

I’ve tried asking question around several people nobody seems definitive answer. Happy cake day! 30% number absolute horseshit. going get train Warsaw Berlin birthday late March. time thought, bad could get? borders closed everything else happened. 

I keeping date Polish covid news surprised bad gotten. first cases came Poland later elsewhere Europe remember right. Contact tracing much lower number infected people. Would great everyone distance worked huh? internet, electricity, groceries Amazon delivery says no. 

There literally zero empathy shown parents essential workers children. sick tired ""They islands, course get COVID influx"" BULLSHIT. actually believe COVID cases America SOLEY bad actors coming Canada Mexico, somehow sneaking borders night cough us sleep?

Airlines fly countries every fucking day. like America. COVID outbreaks occurred coastal cities served AIRPORTS. know, airports? Japan airports, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand airports. know happens get plane Australia? get put directly QUARANTINE two weeks!

THEY problem COVID used masks, social distancing contact tracing. Three things Americans cannot seem do, MUH FREEDUMBS. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

In seriousness, Fauci -- others -- warned us summer taking high case count fall would dangerous. afraid? step wrong direction, actually. None stages required mask mandates. Staying stage four possibly advancing stage 5 would meant numbers statistics looking good. Moving stage 3 means looking pretty bad. That’s cool. want 100% within 2 weeks devil details. ogy Still waiting first check!  South Korea's population 51 million. closest European country Spain 47 million. many cases per day South Korea getting many Spain? .... Sweden defence alright without masks. ICU mostly empty hospitals. Oh yeah, evil foreigners gathering secret lair plot attack US ""gaps US defences"" exposed. Let guess, want double military budget invade 7 new countries order ""defend"" worthless piece shit country.  Nice dodge questions. I’m glad I’m sore loser like you. Hope grow learn words life little boy. Thank much this. I'm surprised trump push stimulus. always talks great stock market doing. going look really bad last week election stock market red. useless better nothing all. Eh, even UK original names. went London, every place named Monopoly square. Imperial College London team found number people testing positive antibodies fallen 26% June September.

Way past time! think disappears March 

No, completely disappear election! Like light switch flipped! /s  cannot change past. decades school offered simply education. teachers mandated reporters suspect abuse? offer meals? Counseling? Speech services? Fluoride teeth? Support services? Nutrition? cardiovascular disease respiratory disease, makes sense strokes. healthcare right Poland. could happen? Yeah. one removed too. 300k population 50 mio. ~ 0.6%, 0.006% HA HA HAAAA total deaths Covid likely far exceed United States (per capita). Much news Mexico summer went radar attention given US, brazil, Peru, argentina, Ecuador 

They also ran death certificates one point. Well OK, realize depending pandemic going are, getting ""lockdown"" (whatever means) simply mean going back ""normal"".

Your workplace might look - assuming even still there. Shopping usual? Sure, stores still there, likely wear mask, unless live one states run governors denial. Parties? Maybe friends join you. Likely many won't. on.

So you. world going spring back pre-Covid take year. ""Other factors,"" indeed.

Vaccinees much wild card point. How’s Europe looking? Thank you. live, still shot mitigating spread via contact tracing. people basically encouraging refusal cooperate spreading misinformation contact tracing programs flat dangerous. dropped microchip people. That's folsky accurate way saying ""systems momentum."" Spot on, good sir! Agree that. think lot Americans might ability work home indefinitely still make great living, without realizing (or caring) Americans last penny, jobless, etc. poor always seems get shafted one way another, think people realize sort shit show going millions millions jobs come back next Sept (if all). 

Out sight, mind... hospital choices? 40 people died Poland yesterday, quarter one hospital would make maybe try somewhere else could + another 1 exponents kick Actually keep getting banned subreddit whenever mention Chinese forced labor camps. Never banned single subreddit single comment removed decade reddit. hot damn, mods must straight CCP agents US. steal nurses Philippines meet demand. stopping going run time day night, government? Regardless smart decision, completely free make decision.

Safety precondition freedom.  Oxford one two doses though, month apart willinng madate vaccine masks? Math person here. case count hit zero slope twice. wave literally form peaks troughs. even correct epidemiological phrase, it’s mathematically sound be. Nope. county live already stage 3z Ya fuckin' beauties.

Just make sure pops (it will) smash immediately. Auckland able kill second outbreak pretty low-key three week lockdown. earlier act easier squash. Interesting 40 considered young LOL That's JOB. Stop acting like schools supposed social safety net instead education. Well, wanted exit quantitative easing, depended getting federal budget order. Trump's tax cuts rich sent deficits zooming. government tried finance debt without Fed printing money, interest rates would shot roof. There's lot misinformation this, schools super quarantining hoax? people know hoax since ones reported such. happening everywhere. Im tn I've little panicky days. hospital taking patients Georgia, theres huge influx people getting sick. short staffed far in. new hires since hospitals funding fucked pandemic. like 8 techs running 12 person lab now, like 3 people cover third shift. Idk going gets worse?? already work first third cover gap😭 Like making light school shootings? God damn wording.

Yes still wear mask, deal it. 

No still need social distancing everyone vaccinated once. 

How difficult this? Vaccines cure all, even close 100 percent effective(try half that)

Every bodies concerned getting back normal sooner realize normal sooner move fucking lives. 

Change idea social looks like. per capita basis, countries listed still lot better many countries West. Putting exposure, doesn’t Poland strong Conservative party? wondering That's nice you, guess.

But refuse support country that's willing fine/jail people drop hat *if anyone entire building leaves home.*

Does Australia due process equivalent? ""You get keep yachts mansions unless make workplaces COVID free."" Problem solved, money talks. think Nancy wants give Trump anything would help election chances right election, nuts. either side wanted done bad enough, would happen. Neither does. think money comes stimulus? Federal Reserves prints ""lends"" government. made sad-laugh. 2 year wait, finally learn identity son’s stem cell donor Nov 2nd. know right he’s young man Poland. We’ve met many donors recipients states truly bonded. keep making quiet jokes husband, like, donor turns racist, religious fanatic, total douche-bag? I've repeatedly pointed country example one border controls work cases ""widespread community transmission"", *when* suppression measures implemented. necessary. nonetheless includes former.

France real trouble right now. situation worse almost everyone around (except maybe Belgium). Border controls probably much France right now, Germany, absolutely would help, considering neighbor exploding people looking ways curb spread within countries mouth breathers talking closing borders.

Just like poster, reading comprehension terrible. many times said border controls *along* suppression measures within country necessary? Don’t feel bad Australians would know state names US provinces Canada. Poland's fatality rate per population fraction US worst nations western Europe. It’s first wave. surges hit different areas different times. never got first wave. reprieve. even smallest semblance returning normal. It’s pure shit since Middle February. Officially since March 13th. 
Third surge. First wave. take anyone else you. one shot per vector Lol. offensive person you. dont blindly follow anything either, that's opinion matters one.  Jersey City diverse city US, significant immigrant populations. successful, they'd include non citizens. 1/3029 statistically significant Melbourne it. Less three weeks.... Government trust experts people trust government. course, there's crime China, far less it. see hundreds young women going runs 11 pm. see lots college kids leaving laptops cafe table alone go bathroom. get sick, go hospital last worry bills. Good luck America. tldr? I'm dealing friends. want say kids, want deal kids home literally send school hang friends day two directly exposed. running rampant schools. Even though directly testing cases keep popping kids. Plus social network wise it’s hitting one community particular it’s probably good broadcast risk populations aware seen normal black Friday looks like? one participates sane lol Isn’t phase 3 usually thousands people? 8 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. Dr. Fauci's last full week job. 

Trump surely fire immediately election. McConnell ""skinny"" bill, begs question - half loaf better none? McConnell's bill would bailed unemployed businesses. reading article :) students don’t wear masks school. ...Where articles Victoria come lol

I feel like came double doughnuts strangely california pretty good right Historical precedent, course. Spanish Flu, Swine Flu, etc.  Absolutely. antibodies “fall” still exist far 6-7 months based recent studies. people realize it’s antibodies also cell response fights infection. shouldn’t telling someone act post-vaccine case, unless you’ve got insider info vaccine efficacy. Leave interpretation data people working trials, they’ve reached efficacy signal, which, haven’t yet (at least publicly). Speculation fine, sure, don’t say “will happen” actually know data. That's like saying Portugal Germany culture use forks...complete utter nonsense Sure., believe not. Asian countries. Freedom mugged, Freedom Debt tend rank higher Freedom criticise government never listens. statues lady every where. went mountain named Hong Kong. Like mountain exist family got there. Externally countries I'm sure want, internally I'd surprised way. matter political Knowledge necessarily help actively neglecting health care decades. 

Shit, family member one bribe nurses give appropriate levels pain medication dying mother surprised patients got less result. Let’s get arms ready quarterly boosters wish dinner read this. Can't find one, huh? Yeah, think so. putting place system multiple levels/tiers shutdown go effect locally based county's hell, that's crazy lineup. That's thing Europe, there's issue seeing MGMT, Gogol Bordello RATM day. never happens states.  amount homeschooling going now, think phrase still stands.... Seriously kinda double talk pisses off. must missed second wave first...ugh Like hilarious watching self defeating idiocy people thinking they're clever.

Exhibit A, right here. believe scientist says, fuckers White House saying antibodies last 4 6 months... permanently immune. lockdowns implemented extensive spread occurs, help point ingredients subsequent waves baked cake enough virus left circulation recur eventually.

The lesson world learning act fast.  time wait around see happens.  weeks respond. Yah give totally 4th graders cause statistically 23% graduate high school. spineless school administrations bending rules sorts guidelines resulting exposure even people.  awful leadership decision making everywhere.

The first public example Paulding County, Georgia, I'm sure thinking occurred many school boards. many parents actually *want* cooped kids 24/7? McRib basing statement on? like 30 confirmed cases worldwide genomic sequencing. Probably thousand suspected fully confirmed. studies said anti-bodies last least 7 months. reinfection big thing think we'll find next 3 months. 👋 Singapore says hi /lh

Still, good job Victoria! spread general community Singapore much Victoria, still got control. 

👏👏👏 🍩🍩 Good job admitting don’t know “literally” means. proved initial claim wrong you’re moving goalposts. Nice try. Pikachu! here.  bring surprise face. friend getting married May (synagogue big enough guest pew, social distancing okay, we’re Canada cases low), really want able go see marry first man ever treat well. want celebrate love. want hug her. I’m really hoping hug people May. heard named famous lady. think head rich house. 41 year old living parents ""I miss mom miss dad"" part cuts hard. different reasons still. Also thanks gold :) (edit: advisory members) want EUA. Because, technically, study completed so, scientifically speaking, vaccine ""work."" study completed data collected.

Ending study early EUA would invalidate results could theoretically cause damage future research/safety. 

So instead EUA would allow risk get vaccine science officially declared ""works,"" want use ""Expanded access"" frontline workers. general population at-risk still access study remains uncontaminated. success also due fact it’s easy (relatively) control influx people. say experience covid pretty much eliminated Switzerland (well quiet, like 5-10 cases day country 8.5 million). soon reopened borders, skyrocketed. It’s European countries really struggle control influxes. saying going runs 1 morning classify 

"" power right act one wants without hindrance restraint? "" Everyone would get someone could clean pool. think that's actually pretty good analogy too. aged poorly defend Fox News, isn’t “[exposing CNN thing right now? could easily much worse. people don’t see dangerous due 4%+ survival rate. We’re masks distancing years.

If vaccine million people day, would take US entire year vaccinate everyone.

This invest pandemic response infrastructure, go hard prevention bust ass spend stop virus tracks source. I'm not, crazy, man. crazy. Sure, everyone voting voting there's paper money kids never go back school. They're watching laptop. They're listening Alexa. They're tracking phone. They're everywhere! *EvERywhErE AARRRRGGGH* ^they got genuinely hate say fellow country men women, right venn diagram idiots Americans pretty damn near close circle. don’t blame anybody wanting that. Trumb administration owe them! I’m behind idea way. seen Woody Chris Johnson run NY Jets. said, I'ma take chances. low high? Seems like lot nearly high expect be. gives? oh prime minister useless, state governments picked slack done excellent job despite pressures open early. 

our state gov definitely made mistakes, many deaths victoria huge chunk cases attributed aged care, federal governments responsibility. Click bait fear porn. Ignore. Team Trump hospital beds? reiterates little know sure virus, obliterating argument ""it's worse flu."" 🤦🏻‍♀️ pretend power living life usual

Most people power trough. Ya, Im frontline trump approved rushed. fucking way I'm taking it. Sorry folks I'll use mask wear whatever sign shame make hospital I'm taking unproven rushed market vaccine. believe  think safely say healthcare workers cautious taking something rushed market political ploy. They'll limited access PPE, call lucky. ignorance and/or willful rejection civic responsibility runs deep parts. Many people showing better selves moment. Belgium uses completely different method counting covid deaths makes difficult compare nations. hey, need include feel better, go it. find another European country that's performed worse. I'll wait here. XD tbh. Jason Kenney competing Francois Legault title. great time Polish... I'm tempted buying it, practical comes eating drinking. fuck it. Haters gonna hate. everyone rushing hospital dying winter ill skipping around bubble. Yes, whoever removed (if you, thanks!) swift. Especially considering size sub. appreciate you. Cheers! liberties suspended temporarily

There's nothing permanent temporary government policy. Oh yay! can’t WAIT get rushed vaccine disease nearly 0% mortality rate!!! wonder jives 'Thy Brother's Keeper'. I'm worried job market, plan leave get last commission check owed. Yes. 
Literal conversation yesterday; ""If stop getting tested, stop alarm we'll allowed continue."" 
""We've moved away goal overrunning hospitals, number cases matter.""
""Hospitals overrun? many actual CoVid cases many normal hospital occupancy maintains 85% anyways.""
""Well, prevent hospital overrun simply eliminating non-CoVid cases. Stop people things then. elective, we'll plenty beds.""
""Those people get well go home. killing people.""

I just... even know. mental gymnastics see everything fit worldview astounding. I'm accused reading worst news want right. Yeah... comes epidemiology, terms wave surge indicate two different data points pandemic.

A wave complete minimal community transmission extended period time due lockdown/social distancing/mask wear. That’s see true flattening curve. Look Italy example. 

A surge US seeing right third time. Community transmission slowed never really gotten control, therefore surges cases without flattening surges. NZ locked within four weeks first arrival.

To add that, NZ went lockdown strict most, TOTAL 100 cases known entire country. still reached 1500 cases end actively tracing new ones.

Most countries implemented lockdowns 10k+ known cases already, virus already pretty much control, totally impossible implement level tracing targeted testing NZ had. Literally every European country bar Spain performed better.

*Literally* every European country huh...?

* USA - Deaths per million: Belgium - Deaths per million: - [LOL new actually pretty good grip reality guy. Great, even damn virus using lobbyists. How's freedom treating all? place keeps good ongoing tally visualization **current** number infected US? Everyplace seems keep total number infected regardless number recovered. I'm wondering number currently infected people changed time people recover infection. infected count minus recovered count, basically. Wasn’t Australian government compared Trump sometime ago? preventing thousands downstream infections. something powerful something. think America would crush lmao Really blessed live somewhere kids go school week person. Remote school work certain ages hard little ones kids special needs. working braincells.

whee. they’re right, though. It’s going away, ever. We’re still going need masks long time, economic devastation us decade, least.

There’s on/off switch.

Edit: want ride end. cancelled wedding shit, feel lucky still job. act like going disappear year I’m burying head sand. people believe way ends start ignoring restrictions. Something never find reports is: decline compare antibodies viruses? Awesome! come home now? He's busy talking Trump's chances ratings. Idaho less 2 million population, already 1000 cases. You’re aware much takes teacher plan execute class programme? can’t expect offer online hybrids well. still pay well. 

Schools child care services. places learning. Stop putting teachers firing line. guarantee one teacher isn’t desperate get back classroom, front kids. one sacrifice themselves. 

There plenty examples around world lockdowns worked countries getting/have gotten back normal - looking New Zealand, Australia, many Asian countries. Nope. Present argument instead. Good points.... makes sense all. believe United nice America. land few. knew? People clue. People western world ""1st world"" going realize sense superiority founded white supremacy, colonialism lots looting ""the uncivilized"" parts world...most Africa ex.

Nice Hmmm. wonder get revolution . what? Trump fires puts sycophant place? Strategy clearly meant everyone hate heroics. need hero save day, someone probably fucked royally that.

That includes covid handling Europe. Agree. happening Europe, think we’ve gone 8 month wave one, straight Tsunami America. end sight vaccine created. sort wonder gave hospitalized patients begin with. thought pretty well established later stages Covid characterized cytokine storm... basically overactive immune response. Giving Lilly drug, supposed boost immune system even more, seems counter-intuitive.

Zmapp, monoclonal antibody cocktail used treat ebola, restorative effect certain young patients advanced ebola. worth shot see would trick corona, even though point hospitalization seems like viral load main threat autoimmunity like said.  Yes much lower. already seen southern hemisphere. Something like 90% reduction Australia (same respiratory viruses FYI). Flu deaths year US probably less 5 thousand. I'll still hospital, know they'll ""waste"" tests me. daily supply seemingly last 24 hours  Cases mean anything.

Hospital utilization, deaths social economic recovery long pandemic curbed. Agreed. It’s weird pedantic point fight over.

Want people use credit cards? Bake cash back rewards. Companies understand incentivized behavior evil mastermind cabals world don’t?  lot places people returned near normal despite rising cases, continued local recommendations it, constant reminders situation... vaccine.

When vaccine comes out, think rationalization ditch safety.

I speak experience certain extent. I’m part vaccine trial, suspect got shot. place antibody testing office building, intentionally haven’t done psychological aspect. 

Despite knowing got vaccine, found SIGNIFICANTLY less stressed, point tell wander within 6 feet people gym go join pick-up basketball games see going local park.

This coming someone severe anxiety pandemic leading bi-weekly panic attack. 

It’s wild thought immune protection combined society acting normal washed away like 6 months freaked taking major precautions. Instead putting forth efforts act normal, it’s taking self-convincing continue precautions. 

Turns out, me, lifetime normalcy really default go back easily. Almost year precautions hasn’t changed that.

This say, think me, r/coronavirus redditer major anxiety response... big majority people to, especially vaccine shown give least level protection.

Combine fact many stopped caring much is, really don’t think people going keep following restrictions unless mandated enforced. place used harshest enforcement measures ~ verdict worth it? banana stand. ""Gyms health clubs must close half hour hour sanitizing."" 
That must typo? would work? Money babies! Yes that’s problem virus. economy overleveraged can’t afford take break without everything falling apart. Deaths grow. virus among younger population. 


But cannot instruct virus stay population 50.

Only stupid populists tell lies ""we protect vulnerable"". Like Netherlands. I'm shelf stacker. lift boxes fish etc 8 hrs per day, wearing mask . Yup. mean - could go wrong? 20:80 rule feels accurate. dang, 20-ish percent loud. Bruhhh. Comparing Canadian conservatives trump little harsh. Trumps another level. Air travel safe, said.. lol. Can’t hit second wave never leave first! I'm Christian. talking pewhole. Jesus went desert 40 days. likely wore face covering protect sun, wind, cold. time wasted summer preparations, politics waiting done! Oh games played! Stupid 40% killing 60%. Nice try already checked, miss Nebraska well though. Resilience quality needed nurse absolutely critical. Remember take care health. Take time decompress every clinical. Many people like family continue deny gravity pandemic even directly affected it. Humanity may intelligent species, far wisest. 


I know many positive cases team exposed to. 1 shift exposed **new** case. *a* case, **new** one. Disney World open, patients state flooding tested. report results hundreds patients department health every week. risk becoming overwhelmed always high us, problem risk becoming overwhelmed *too frequently*. 


I actively remind purpose help patients care, all. downtime nursing patient care continuous. constant. nurse works 24/7, *person* cannot. able every single task every single patient needs done shift. tasks pile running around like headless chicken, stop. Take deep breath wash hands (no one bother washing hands). that, take another deep breath. One patient time. One task time. 


Thank helping us fight virus. Even directly carrying covid patients, know every little task one less nurses shadowing means much us. Time precious. good job.

Give fucking break. avoiding 'second wave' like like avoiding hangover staying drunk fuck WCGW That's like saying ""I even discuss pointing loaded gun head"" Well... Fuck. Thanks info expected pandemic fatigue set in. look activity gone done sub look hard get people change behavior things long run (diets, new year's eve promises, etc). anything I'm bit surprised fatigue.

Can't really blame politicians experts either think. long time since pandemic scale. Science messy answers, still don't. Usually disagreements discussions within obscure journals scientific conferences general public never reads attends. public media clamored information anyone would say anything heard answer's picked apart condensed easily digestible, expected loss details nuance.

Hopefully regulars knew hadn’t left first wave. Pls dont forget /s bro frankly theres shitton people seriously claiming nonsense. Singapore plenty testing we’re well way Phase III.

Cheers!  I’m going Threat Level Midnight. think it’s mainly schools, restaurants gyms open causing increase cases. important thing Rate infection well cases needing hospital/icu visits, remain lower first wave. Lots cases reported younger people, likely serious complications it. think, long we’re letting guard down, handling second wave ok, now.  person questioned whether lockdowns work, responded giving viewpoint lockdowns. claim strict lockdown alone magically made coronavirus disappear? No, simply said common theme. person asked aspects coronavirus response, would’ve touched lot lockdowns. 

Put simply, strict lockdowns common component successful coronavirus response. comment pointless, you’re complaining argument one making fucking cares wave is? don’t see that’s important distinction. Shit fucked matter “wave” is... Plus, airline business association made claim? jobs pretty strict medical requirements. Say pilot pro athlete.

Even law prohibited asking medical history using basis employment. curious, would process creating job required certain anti-bodies?

There anyone anti-bodies work right ridiculous travesty.

40 million people work matter they've gotten virus not. Oh BTW research shows antibodies last 3 months. think actually people flat refuse believe even pandemic. No?

We don’t know one year thing. don’t even think half us expected last seven months. really don’t think year argument fair unless you’re psychic.

That said, mentioned good points appreciate productive conversation. Good luck students!  obvious solution fire Fauci!

Sadly wish joking Trump seems getting ready do. supposed do? seen state healthcare system? Nothing changed 15 years (since I've last hospital there). can't magically turn coal gold, thats government cut country neighbours fast. forget ( southern hemisphere somewhere) New Zealand basically non existent flu season.

i worry much people relevant education training think. People Idaho continuously demonstrate don’t believe COVID, masks, education, reason. Even officials charge health rules like “I don’t think people getting sick COVID.” like think that, vaccine gets approved going war chaos countries get them. Next level thinking. Can't second wave leave first! rather both? Spring rails! Yeah rookie numbers gotta pump up! It’s social distancing that’s issue . It’s virus that’s destroying global economy. Ffs.

There initial peak fell, another peak &amp; another fall. daily cases surpassed previous peaks margin. 

The 7 day rolling average cases fell around 20,000 first peak. 35,000 second peak. 7 day rolling average case numbers 71,000. Epidemiologists say waves? What?

I think lockdowns bad idea anymore rising rates, many better options reopening schools, workplaces, bars crossing one's fingers. According 24,732 cases / million people

South Korea 508 cases / million people. respect educated people. surprising well. groups work together get children teachers back classrooms safely? 

and problem. One group want put safely. They're kids go back school masks mandatory, (or enough) safety measures set up, way early. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've outlined would ""safe"" (safer...not ideal do). real treatment out. vaccines out. Personally, treatments looking like safer thing. start roll out, safely start going classrooms protections, guidelines, etc.

But focus ""get back soon"". can't like ""safe"". 

&amp;nbsp;

I'd willing go back treatments released readily available. Vaccines...less another compromise. student teacher group don’t want come back, continue online. student teacher likely safe want go person, go person.

Not enough personnel that. need teachers distance learning school. mentioned earlier, school setting systems we'll able target both, honesty, we're going paying even LESS attention ones online need concentrate online students in-class students. Trying tie together that's dividing class more. statistics saying risk protect them? 

Social distancing, masks, cleaning, closed quarters others. school, even half capacity days, would still allow this. kids still kids slip often adults comes masks/cleaning. 

&amp;nbsp;

You're talking economically, intellectually, mentally I'm talking health death. One take precedence other. Especially 1 year thing.

&amp;nbsp;

I see treatments coming sooner later. Vaccines much trickier think they'll held longer stronger versions developed. 

&amp;nbsp;

As privilage. Look, want live. want students live. want students' family members live. would mightily desasterous someone died covid19 (or complications causes conditions) ""they needed back school"".

&amp;nbsp;

Our fundamental difference think kids need school social educational purposes think provide enough educate home spreading virus...and spread. 

I agree long term plan include going back school. However, seem think we're already ""long term"". Nah, still recent. Long term year excuse let people fall behind

a pandemic possible death perfectly good excuse. yes. 4 teachers dying school (4% 80). 15 students dying going school (3% 600). 80 parents/grandparents/family members dying (4% 2000 kids school contact school). 1 death tragedy. 4 teachers, 15 students, 15 family members. That's lot deaths. Now, mean everyone school get covid. reality enclosed spaces mean lot infections. didnt know guy everyones listen herd might wildly Beautiful tons similar videos coming Wuhan January. everyone else saw videos early idea happen. Champ? Ok... Obviously I'm staying indoors home I'm working... I'm hoping enough people take stops spreading. shizzmynizz fella sounds like he's got good head shoulders, tell ya hwat  Lol. Every day told state Premier get tested minor symptoms. constant TV ads reincorcing message go get tested. also financial assistance offered would lose income isolate tested. Everyone know tested point expected us symptoms even casual contact cases. Honestly perpetual flood Yes years pis turned country shithole. Harsh reality parties redeemable qualities. October. Coming November.

People still thinking lockdowns alone solve matters. contact tracing. mass testing. isolation facilities. ""Just lockdown everything ok.""

It's amazing even proponents locking understand purpose locking down, lock downs part arsenal, used buy time get measures places. Even October.

How poor public health messaging west? like people west seem blindly copy single aspect successful nations without understanding measures place. October. 9 months first lock downs China. It'd funny pathetically sad. complete assumption objectively true.

The media could approach bit differently.

Based average winter (your winter) New Zealand's average temperatures ranges 7-15 degrees C. According still winter, July humdity well 80 percent.

Our winters cold. warmest city Vancouver winter high New Zealand's winter low. cities like Edmonton range -6 -15 degrees celicus (a full 10-30 degrees colder).

Despite snow fall see, extremely dry. Perfect conditions respiratory virus spread. Right October (not even winter) [average afternoon already 70 percent large parts Canada. Even moderate areas like Vancouver dry. really need documentary CCP’s coverup coronavirus. even full year. *Some* people thought thing going seasonal ""go away heat"". still seen effects winter spring (it full swing summer). wonder grocery store runs going start. Who’s ready months empty toilet paper shelves again? course speculation generally vaccines do. literally open mouth kiss doorknob Current ohio population 11.69 million (2019)

To get death rate, divide deaths total pop, 5100/11,700,000 move decimal 2 left get % deaths.

That means death % Ohio 0.04%? correct? Thats super low number.

EDIT : Yall echo chamber shockingly loud. asked question yall downvote numbers accurate? Thats CFR even IFR. wish people would stop ignorant acknowledge raw data. Bloody NSW letting us going conistant Spamnish flu. People waiting case count drop almost 0 end wave. different virus. graph similar same. Spanish flu sharpe drop cases gradual. Feburary, virus likely resovled itself.
Fauci basking spotlight publicity. longer pandemic lasts, money TV time Fauci gets. read published studies make determination. Well, situation definitely better Europe Americas. Single digit numbers every country's dream. Well done.

Golf claps. Reddit PhD right  “You libtards full shit, I’ve always canoed New York.” What’s funny people say Bill Gates’ funded vaccine would probably first get Elon Musk’s Neuralink device. wouldn’t care better sex. draw line start putting computers bodies fun, let alone brains. It’s Black Mirror episode already making, bet Elon already one head (maybe time). She’s old too. Sounds like weren’t top distancing requirements. 76, co-chairs Joint Budget Committee Legislative Council. also mother state Surgeon General Greg said lawmakers plan resume budget hearings Tuesday new safety procedures including distancing legislators. wish speedy recovery. Must feel like shit reading thread full people talking sniffles efforts everyone put nothing fake news. US first everything! COVID waves included.  mean could help get tools need protect themselves, willing... seem even that. Major lockdowns harm good considering fact many western nations seeing huge upticks strictly locking down. seemed claim vaccine military going administer right away. make whole lot sense. says great many things. COVID patients hospital, likely won’t bed anyone presents ER, even don’t COVID.

Basically COVID cases = worse care people don’t COVID. Ok times living - even obvious concepts debate. 'fake news ' people, choose observe science experts kind, go obviously incompetent conman looking says believe Valentine's/st.patricks/easter/4th july/labor day/halloween/thanksgiving/Christmas/birthday party wrapped one. feel like would like kissing soldier picture (but consent) crazy, top comments here. Jesus, ask go back anti mask rallies. Americans laughed west africans unable ditch funerary traditions involved sleeping deceased ebola victims eating meals/washing bodies.

Not funny Americans unable control going restaurant 2 months end deadly pandemic. Wave 1.3  fact generally seriously affect children--which FAR given, going pandemics--is something grateful rest life. actually mentally challenged think first wave ever ended. getting worse worse guys essentially ignoring it. Big yikes. Can’t wait everyone get this. definitely taking soon can. Despite bitter fucks come say ""I told lockdowns work!"" every time NZ new cluster, we've actually proven pulling one good solid lockdown getting cases zero means there's good chance need ones, even cases pop up.

Since August, Covid re-emerged mysteriously NZ, we've following outbreaks: 

* [Cold-store - still know patient zero was. caught late required semi-strict lockdown three weeks Auckland stamp out. Became country's biggest cluster date spawned sub-clusters. Wake-up call country.

* [Hotel maintenance caught quarantined returnee (the ""elevator button"" case). Identified early spread anyone else.

* [Quarantined left quarantine two negative tests fourteen days isolation tested positive. Spread least one person flight quarantine, family (who went big holiday visiting bunch tourist hotspots). Intensively contact tracted stamped lockdown.

* [Port caught maintenance ship picked crew Philippines. Spread couple colleagues. Still quite early days looks like we've aggressively contact traced submission new cases linked nearly week now.

There many ""scares"" infected people escaping quarantine otherwise coming contact community none resulted community transmission.

What's emerging pretty solid proof keep cases baseline 0, effective contact tracing stamp new outbreak without need new lockdowns. virus obviously fairly infectious measles - can't outspread intensive contact tracing can't hide among noise uncontrolled community spread.

NSW Australia proven - cases popping months end traced shit successfully got cases back 0 lockdown. Victoria definitely they've done hard work.

And course got Southeast Asia, quietly effectively right beginning.

Baseline 0 heavy contact tracing sustainable way respond Covid vaccine widely available. low numbers genomic testing every single case identify precisely came from, giving us good confidence whether unknown chains transmissions there. simply can't hundreds thousands daily cases - there's effectively intevention left except various flavours lockdown. China crazy. crazy, no-nonsense, Draconian nature big benefit must saved many lives.

I knew first saw really sealing people buildings. Nowhere else going that, especially America. might nuts, know look, unless everything else failed to. That's really realized fucked. thought got light, no. We're fucked. gonna get much worse that's horrifying because, come on, who's great time right is? think things like % infected whole population, positivity rate tests, fatality rate Covid far useful numbers

Yeah, okay, [IFR COVID sitting around infected doesnt matter % death isnt direct result - not. large majority people become infected experience symptoms issues. Positivity rates tests dont help either tests 100% even 100%, remains large % people cant wont get tested. imagine instead positivity rates fatality rates, use CFR IFR - mean it’s safe drive drunk?

No, thats horrible connection. strawman argument. arent talking drunk drivers, direct relation. even *were* - comparing wrong numbers. know total amount drunk drivers (caught *and* uncaught), also take account many drivers **total**. Horrible attempt comparison.

Either way, tiny fraction. Whats % rate 225k 350million? Thats CFR. imagine least 50-60% **UNTESTED/ASYMPTOMATIC** people - number shrinks dramatically.

Using 'useful numbers' - % infected whole population vs fatality rate? (Ill give hint - called IFR) would people give shit people they've never met? spent time caring dead never live day life. Ever Rwanda? Tens thousands murdered sundown. seeing massive increase cases DUE INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL.

That's great, country one post. countries seeing massive increases due international travel. people coming abroad led every country Earth besides China covid within country,

Yes closing borders important low cases country. getting tens thousands everyday closing borders far less important. get derail attempts control community transmission country

Not significantly. community taking proper procedures screen isolate positive individuals matter case came long handle responsibly prevent spreading. case coming across border different case didn't. proper guidelines within country isolate contact trace somebody coming across border great concern thry positive. latter far important entire argument cannot comprehend it. I've said, untold number times, border controls internal suppression required limit spread covid.

Yes specific instance latter exponentially greater importance. Keeping border closed even important take proper measures newcomers, like screening beforehand isolate two weeks. Also state many countries focus internal suppression, borders. countries getting cases abroad worry border waste time. Obviously countries getting covid abroad waste time, none countries discussed post getting abroad. prevent covid-infected people entering country inevitably derail suppression efforts.

Not supression efforts include isolating newcomers screening beforehand. internal policies much important ""cLoSe bOrDeR"". mean realize countries still trading eachother right? 100% border closure impossible. another reason solid plans mitigate spread within community highest priority. Getting case abroad almost inevitably, need plan place handle cases locally extend beyond braindead chants thread ""close border"". Closing border like 1% fucking job done. rest done internally. focused countries either never got virus transmission control

AKA one fucking post about? majority them? talking countries, post about, plans need include within country. border closure need right now. need stricter guidelines domestic spreading. give rats fucking ass prison nation accomplished. thread guys bring border closure. Unfortunately rest us, closing borders least concerns. would also like point significantly easier maintain border closure fucking island. Try sharing longest land border worst hit country get back me. continue focus particular countries border restrictions least amount impact

**BECAUSE THAT'S FUCKING POST restrictions working countries high infection rates

The implication statement work stop domestic spread, primary goal solution countries looking right now. Again, give fuck Australia, post you. fucking France, border closure help right all. Shutting things bailing people lot cheaper paying hundreds thousands people hospitalized time, many may lose hones due able work.

But again, moron chief worst businessman time, wonder economy failing. double digit IQ Gotcha. agree then! right! Something like ""old people love gamble, take spin 15% chance death!"" target approving vaccine candidate, efficacy actually estimate fuck talking about? world besides completely isolated nations huge upticks. France, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Spain exploding recently.

This American thing. know that's said, really trust (seriously asking)? know said leader get lie like doctor lied sick? Can’t second wave keep making first one worse don’t believe get vaccine Christmas. believe spring, right around it. 
I think next summer, people go back normal lives.  Whenever finally get vaccine probably burst tears ugly cry. Probs cry announced well. reference Krystal thehill youtube channel told third wave. Kind of. fitting data curve data points often outliers. curve tells input response, outliers tell good fit otherwise largely ignored.

If treat peaks troughs outliers curve slowly increasing, tells much different story one virus peaked subsided due numerous different inputs. ty dan today's captain obvious award goes ... talking moron /r/sanfrancisco going there's nothing try ""hide"" it. smh got back son tested came home school sniffles yesterday. testing place full sons file pulled pile around 30 files remaining appointments get tested clinic today.

Tests definitely happening.

Also, scared get tested seeing others get news etc. good see testing kids less harsh. got tested months ago rammed swob right nostrils. kids place swob half way one nostril. Shoot! thought official. Seems male female get branded ""Karen""  Feel sorry whose names really Karen. (Not mention sexist seems. Seems like people get passed things.) words language doesn’t mean much impossible enforce, might well say need everybody hide inside homes. likely happen standing 10 feet away friends. Yes. do. none outbreaks tied schools. like 3rd wave high storm surge.

The western democracies skipped surge us summer wave. new wave hitting northern hemisphere big time. Imagine US. **caddyshack entered chat is. go, ""Senator"" -- piping hot plateful steaming feces, napped covid virus. Enjoy! sure though? kind decent studies really. Schools open months now. confirmation bias strong here.

Again, people like hearing things shake world views. might think school age children spreading virus, conclusive evidence contrary. One newspaper article going cut either. 

There scientists doctors world spreading misinformed ideas virus. see time. going take years research figure true impact virus going humanity. 

I ask too, disease spreading schools getting young kids wear mask would huge challenge? 

Quote article linked evidence far conclusive, much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis. School reopenings much work progress. Still, many experts encouraged results date. 

Scientist barely scratching surface Covid-19 mate. really know jack shit. going see lot info media trying reassure people previous normal life activities safe. Remember, media outlets owned basically 5 corporations. stop nothing order keep wheels going. internet point? Fuck government take care ppl instead companies first. animals herded! Good. Buy Peloton.

And you’re done arranging parlor room, sure check Whole Foods order time tip lazy driver!

$1900 “solution” core health problem time can’t even provide decent unemployment people... I’m sure mean analogy “work home” ya, ok, lots change want people listen, least slightly practical. sub using unicorns leprechauns measurement tools expect Third phase first wave like New Yorkers saw handles things got state control first major outbreak US... without federal help.

He could wear tutus furry suits dancing Taylor Swift basement care. don’t care personal time. fact insult shows fucking touch pathetic are. Schools schools. They're building children learn in. let learn. pay taxes them. must purpose sacrifices, otherwise temptation say nothing reopen proper precautions. Schools Illinois already done safely 2 months.

Have noticed Illinois skyrocketing cases now? think there's zero correlation here? Yes, government extorting people jogging mask-less society strive be. scientists lying friend! lied us can't trust gut. gut says buissness usual, let old vulnerable fend selves! ...until get used distance learning, wonder turn education private companies cheaper. Bye bye, brick mortar schools. Bye bye, tenured staff. 

Frankly, I'm tired hearing educators complain. would refreshing get rid sense entitlement education system.

You want teach person? Fine. tax payer want kids schools, either, let's get rid them. 

You reap sow. Pretty bleak think one powerful nations world things place prevent haven’t even left first wave let alone fact another record breaking day. It’s terrifying Well, hospitalize them. Bing bang boom. Pfizer's better t-cell response well? seriously. can't catch covid fish. Like said. There's way less risk kids influenza. close schools that. entirely different story older people. schools open months issues far. Life full risks. take risk every day things. Oh guys quote cdc? thought Trump compromised them. selected bias insane. 

Also cdc decides people need act. I'm dining indoors mask less friends, looks like idiots ones held bunker waiting arbitrary point time may never come. Thanks always posting alternative links. welding side backdoors could monitor coming street. /noahhgetthearkready Finally said loud what's obviously policy months Oh man. got 700 day Great Lockdown next day. talk head I've calling third surge. I? Yep. Everyone know claims take super progressive anti-trump conspiracy theorists think CDC still trying help Trump get elected therefore can't trust vaccine. asked would take exact vaccine Biden elected, said yes. People exactly rational anymore. second wave, American one (currently wave one) astounding. friend lives Western Australia, live Florida US. texting maybe month two ago life like right other, said life almost completely normal area everyone wears masks throw fit cry whine. think said like 20 something total cases whole area.

Meanwhile Central Florida, live less hour Disney world, work hospital. see many covid patients work many covid patients I'm tired it. know can't expect everybody stay home forever, least wear damn masks practice social distancing. that's even much lot people here. I'm it. There's estimate true rate infections [IHME looked estimate it, reliable is, one I've seen. *What counts ""wave"" pandemic extremely difficult define* That's even truth completely objective, defined wave. Thank you, Dr. Obvious head manager interviewed said could “take shit face.”

What?? That's fucked up. located, mind asking? drug maker Eli Lilly said Monday antibody treatment ineffective patients hospitalized advanced Covid-19 government-sponsored trial would administer drug new company said trials treatment, people sick exposed virus, would continue, remained optimistic treatment could work given early course disease elect President? Fucking good. teacher noble profession still JOB. insist expecting people sacrifice lives, families' lives, beyond me. like expect teachers martyrs sake children's education. absolutely ridiculous. sub echo-chamber full virtue signals get thinking super smart, caring people no-social-life lifestyle validated. they've gone gun deaths route covid deaths I'd rather child end socially awkward dead preventable virus. ohio, county went red (but surrounded red). changes. School still open (my kids virtual, even taking chance), people still wearing masks, distancing. fucking mess Right, thought terms Covid restrictions SF Baby Area. shut first week March. fully restrictive lockdown months. 

Hell, 40 cases day county opened restaurant dining... 25% capacity. many small restaurants, literally 1-2 tables restaurants aren’t it. It’s perfect obviously, despite one densest populations country we’ve kept numbers manageable numbers entire time. hospitals never hit capacity, mayors governor already said they’ll shut us back numbers even show trend getting worse. flu couple years ago, shit nearly killed me. 40, good shape, preexisting conditions. Dr. Fauci pointed out, ongoing—wave. order new wave start, previous one stop—which hasn't. 


Quote comment. post specifically USA. think many people fear virus anymore...they got used  Damn lot make hard! feel big reason wa qld talking separating aus victorians media lashing whilst strict quarantine Actually report last Wednesday county, elementary school child beat death parent morning. report mentioned much child loved school tons teachers speaking highly them. current teacher started worry started poorly online school stopped showing online class. Wonder different things would’ve school morning instead crazy abusive parent. least didn’t die COVID right? OK measures, masks central vitally important component Taiwanese response.

I agree significant measures would necessary control spread places virus much widespread. raised Taiwan response specific question - efficacy masks called question. Lets hire somebody replace RPaul.

You need little Zen life.

Everyone die. There's nothing it. 

People do. There's little it. 

If mad stupid people stupid things, maybe time focus something else. could focus breathing, example. posture. control control posture. 

What's heart rate? last time listened heart beat? last time listened someone else's heart beat?

Trump said things, people Canada said something, OP said something disagreed with. might seemed important you, time. important me. important you, allowed be. 

:) Believe not, poverty nowadays detriment want society big population. Plenty 'poor' nations 100+ million people. important factors sustainable populations urbanization women's education / workplace participation. 

For size, Latin America low population base. 1500, Europeans arrived Eurasian diseases wiped 90% Native population. Demographically, long game catchup. 


Around early 20th CE, populations began exploding healthcare improved. Unlike sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America urbanized fairly quickly late 20th century, discouraged large families (and Italy) famous for. African population dynamics likely similarly slow urbanized. Victorians would struggled time. They've done hard work they'll reap rewards. Sadly countries can't even figure full proper lockdown works. /s think simple say, ""hey copy NZ/aus did"". compare city like paris country france melb aus. compare florida it... geoprahics populations obscenely, insanely different.

I think tactics australia nz well suited us. underlying wealth power it.

But much purely question money. can't fucking tell state residing richest country earth's history, wealth france, cannot pay 6months lockdown.

Like, cannot believe that. know different countries situations are, impossible money there.

Cut defense budgets 50% voila *He said country never reduced nationwide baseline new cases 10,000 per day states began reopening, bringing peak 30,000 70,000 per day. Heading fall, cases increased 80,000 per day.*

*”If look chart, we’ve never really waves, sense good baseline. It’s wavering till now, highest baseline we’ve ever been, really quite precarious.""* Uh, yeah responding comment twice, I've gotten notifications comments removed because.....that's role. honestly suggesting covid 19 dangerous neccessary implement mandates? obviously committed engaging form community conditioning order achieve uniformity aligns personal opinions. think misunderstand, believe people like you, people think like you, threat society virus itself. one said animal. That's tell. fact thing done entire conversation fluff up, constantly reminding moral superiority. mean digging way ""social contract"" point post that's almost 2 days old. sure I'm, crazy one. Fact is, opinion essentially worth nothing, single insight could provide isnt baked headline somewhere. well first clear incapable making argument isnt cliche. known suggested government overreach problem Trump. Read book, look around you, Covid thing happening. real though, get cheap body suit face shield. extra cash hand friends. change want see world, masks keeping people wearing safe, lead example show em done. third time, fuck off. didnt get message censored. &lt;&lt;&lt;theres alot happening covid AKA people today fucking stupid realize yes, change lives order survive pandemic. Available, free ans get result bakc 24 hours  point doesn’t make sense. thet used means doesn’t prove masks can’t job. either way, you’re splitting hairs, point means without vaccine, people dicks won’t work. well, that's next week I'm glad see community transmissions port worker last week. NZ top it! 4 months - hard lockdown. lmao, thanks Glad agree  Yes, throw rock swimming pool wave spreads across whole area. still first wave US. really makes sense compare smaller geographic areas, like size EU countries US states. Spain, Italy, Michigan legitimately hitting second wave. North Dakota clearly still first wave. Belgium little difficult, would call first wave. I’m sick “we’re going wearing masks distancing YEARS!” fear porn. vaccine widely available we’ll back normal within couple months. simultaneously shut Fox news, sinclair, conservative talk radio, every breitbarty 'news' site, wait 20 years there's anything level moving forward nationally. hadn’t banned abortion days ago wouldn’t happened! /s happen we’ll need actual leader takes seriously works experts get done, Mango Mengele need settle down. must exhausting argue people day. ever need airlift somewhere, go ahead pay pocket then. guest. I'm happy Canada at. Good luck everything, psycho. analogy ""wave"" context pandemic traveling lately.

It's cleaning shit everyone's pool months (and that's 99.9% complete forgotten), realizing early next year people shitting carpets tracking everywhere. Newly discovered vector.

Enter next wave. can't believe Poland sacrificing citizens make Trump look elections. unusual, schools India shut since March. clearly happening community [level].

This study absolutely nothing schools. closed. Antibodies detected six months people, long studies run. knows, Christmas reading people detectable antibodies eight nine months post infection K hell Poland banned abortion?! Thank friend  What? No, plenty poor regions massive populations hundred million. Population dynamics actually field study worth plenty hours analysis. Things vary based everything region's basic crop religious incentives.

The main 'danger' Latin America population implosion 1500s, Europeans arrived Eurasian diseases wiped 90% base population. always fairly low population region. acted early enough required. Wearing masks alone going much countries severe spread  much produce per month? give everyone tests pos. dose maybe need see hospital inside. vaccine good cough-syrup, say. :)  Italy lockdown. mean, flu shot costs almost nothing 50% chance saving week bed every couple years. Seems like great trade. I'm practically zero risk serious effects flu, factor flu shot might save people brainer.

It's basically calculations covid, 1/20th stakes. you’re saying people know children aren’t super spreaders “there haven’t kind decent studies” “scientists doctors... spreading misinformed ideas”.

But you’re one saying “kids like plague rats pandemic” scientific proof evidence all. Like asked people, sure though? Wearing masks outside mandated. locked restricted non essential travel. 

The thing happened Italy overcrowded hospitals, free abortions available women.

Almost nothing abortion brought good reason. Yes, need SOMETHING. Anything. Even harmful. Lololol indeed. NZ locked hard mask use particularly widespread fearmongering media disagrees, it’s third wave! Victoria, Australia we're starting open things week. rules say keep 1.5m apart, indoor spaces like gyms, maximum occupancy 1 person per 8m^2 indoors. amount seems reasonable me. Lol you’re saying wrong saying CPS “only” one? Good know. butthurt downvote cracks btw helps confuse people implies first wave ended. Yeah, Fox already told CDC can't trusted, like 'MSM' need get alternative facts conservative sources (checks notes) entirely made up. Yes - ""lockdown"". europe year round school. Dude move past Covid open place tbh put past reddit celebrate us badly supposed information? months, that's study concludes. that, knows. messaged :) It’s easier hate accept truth, sadly. That's easy say one gasping air ICU. Yes, risk low, again, way knowing 97% survive, 3% die. let's face it: get infected develop severe disease, would still go hospital get treated, thus potentially infecting people consuming lots medical supplies already limited due hospitals overwhelmed severe cases. That's individual desire take risk affect you, everyone else around you. Massachusetts would make sense. Exactly. bridge party tourist stunt foreigners nothing current wave. outbreak traced event. street protests far bigger issues well bridge party summer. Demonstration Ostrava Prague Palacky Square far damage prevention tourist event. tourists showed Palacky Square? demonstration restrictions nowhere mentioned foreigner press event tourists gets reposted every day?! Or, alternatively, people control NPR much interest getting everyone infected ones control shitty people Trump said they're rounding bend! Well fair, he's parroting back conservative talking points... least spell suppose? Lawyer/paramedic here. Depends. mass casualty situation, allowed triage patients ""unsalvageable"". carry color coded disaster tags that. Black means ""let die"". legal bioethics issue. know Texas declared state emergency might apply, really necessary. need disaster patients outstrip resources personnel provide sufficient care. Better Missouri tho! say exclusively American. media lying!??? Dude said never lived there. make fucking assumptions. Women Japan walk home 2am without worrying assaulted. know this? lived there. seen it. Women getting wobbly drunk walk home without care world initially worried first. years living realize norm. lived yet telling going there? Get high horse! Good unions. Every worker one. union decided - it’s majority teachers want - that’s is. fact Union rates low America average person gets Jack shit government - unions exist workers workers. *gets cure COVID, immediately contracts HEP-C* Unions literally exist look workers. That's lol, nobody else will. parents way, thousands teachers would dead parents got sit home drinking wine working home free daycare kids. Smart lockdowns work. Innovation quarantining. war, adapted overcame sorts ways ww2.

Human lives matter, rich first world countries wealth save lives months. terrified leaning domestic massive companies money could go even longer

Imo message that's clearly communicated yes, can't lockdown forever, mental health factor biggest issue imo.

But lockdown know it, ie, stalling vaccines treatments.

The message stalling vaccines almost seems taboo governments talk know why. that's here.

If people common goal faced on/off strict quarantining, think would profoundly easier large populations stomach.

 goal think delaying/surviving vaccines. don’t get it. would two related? abortion ward coronavirus? hate admit it, agree. know absolutely one died COVID. I've know one person OD'd result pandemic stress two people died going hospital/taking ""wait see"" approach something normally have.  economic social impact social distancing family far negatively outweighed firsthand covid accounts heard. I'm still cautious, damn starting lose keep up. believe you. Sweden's economy hit less hard. post link back up. post source back Plenty not. curb all, except city. NY literally superspreader country residents fled city. First line article:

""The coronavirus outbreak New York City became primary source infections around United States, researchers found.""  That's cute, dense? followed news recent protestors getting thrown jail? happened MLK, Black Panthers, person group people criticized government? think CIA, FBI, three letter investigates? understand US Government kill list, right? cause enough noise throw weight US federal government towards you, along help media portraying ""terrorist"" kill you. read news US government sanctioned hit squad running protestor killing him, right?

Here's one article may want read think that’s banned abortion? masks elimated virus New Zealand. People setting disappointment think wearing mask alone get rid corona. TLDR stands ""too long, read,"" FYI Stupid polish people believe covid xd u pay that. U freakin snowflakes. Arizona 75% drop effectively halted crazy spike months ago cities began instituting mask ordinances. Weird, impression several countries abortion legal also coronavirus get control overfill hospitals...must dream. literally people eating restaurants selfish assholes. reason eat inside restaurant pandemic. TIL Yea, said CSpan. need reserve medical masks medical personnel’s. asked government produce masks never back February.

The quote taken context. effective since isn’t enough, must save medical personnels. Back then, masks sold out. asking people take masks away people hospital smart. yes, told people wear masks save doctors nurses. Happy see that! wave signal processing wave virus. word, different contexts. Signal processing definitely used epidemiology Fauci's context nothing signal processing. 



The point contention mainly political. closest reality either wave two death curve two peaks, deaths probably accurate depiction covid due imperfections behind testing/asymptomatic cases. wave one location USA one death peak two peaks country result one wave moving geographically. Denying new wave saying country experiencing new wave political talking point ""it's getting worse, we're good job"" ""it's getting worse, we're bad job"". strict definition epidemic wave phase. wave implies rising number sick individuals, defined peak, decline. word “wave” implies natural pattern peaks valleys; hints even lull, future outbreaks disease possible. really, really drop borderline racist ""Asians morally superior"" thing.

Followed whole bunch generalisations hellhole societies

Lmao zero self awareness. Kentucky... so, yeah. July 10th 820 cases. July 24th 885. highest days point. August many days 2-300 range even 175 one day. Sept 17th increase 892. New highest day. First time 1k 9/24 1219. 9/25 1370. see dip daily count chart Google Utah coronavirus look statistics see day's numbers. thought oddly convenient numbers went back July, right school supposed start. http://imgur.com/a/VXEQQ9u claims one never board-certified. Turd mentality even really protect wearer much. Covid 50-64: IFR == 0.14 %

Flu: IFR &lt;= 0.04 death worst outcome. like cycling risk lungs. I'd unlucky, I'd get oxygen dialysis veins legs. know teasing, make sure things salvage sanity too! Take care state's mess go out. all. things safer, I'd out. would way better get numbers low hold restrictions people young uncaring self centered dolts go again. f chat Can’t second wave never leave first ;-) India lot younger average age western countries. 

In poorest areas studies showing already widespread infection therefore maybe herd immunity now. 

There also culture putting old people nursing homes cross infected. old ppl live kids still. Yeah. One thing China well listen scientists. comes climate change. wish American politicians would listen experts specific topics, we've got significant portion entire party refuses so. point I’m trying make bad ought taken seriously.

Is though? causing deaths sure, fearmongering total people making be. many people know personally suffered covid death one families? one circle friends friends. direct friends havent either. 2 friends work directly one largest hospitals texas, tested positive still havent issues.

Okay dude, here. still drive car knowing drunk drivers road? Im 100% sure do. theres answer - dont stop driving drunk drivers, stop living life sickness cant control either?

You cherry pick numbers want, ones matter CFR IFR. Thats it. Hospitalizations dont matter, positivity rates unreliable fuck, metrics arent paying attention ones really true form.

Case Fatality Ratio Infected Fatality Rate. Thats it. Tell another number doesnt fall either those. fake news beyond sickening already! Can't wait till 4th. fear mongering silenced finally. frauds finally shut hell up. dont think they're protesting covid mate human rights Husband tested positive antibodies August Red Cross (you get free test give blood). donated September, antibodies still much lower, low fact couldn’t sure actual positive. never sick, symptoms. assume asymptomatic. can’t even backwards timeline guess absolutely signs. last time sick December 2019, thought read somewhere antibodies could stick around six months guess that’s possible. Weird thing antibody tests negative. Still doesn’t change said “Fauci says regret telling Americans wear masks beginning pandemic” - Indian seasons like Northern Australia (Wet/Dry moreso Hot/Cold)? BUT.... ensuring shitshow gets worse lasts longer everyone. spring summer, people eager get back old lives despite virus there. It’s much risk people willing take. People taken precautions year doubt begin crack. transition back old normal eventually, even virus still us. problem high Ct value occur early incubating phase infection, illness, know viral numbers increasing decreasing single test/point time.

Therefore, precaution best assume person high Ct become infectious.

It suggested Ireland, test twice, week apart, capacity. Instead, there's suspect positive high Ct sample tested again, ideally different machine, reducing risk false positive. 

We limit testing twice, week apart, close contacts people ill COVID-19, however, half turn second test. spouse front line worker. best friend heart lung condition. wife doctor. always joke get vaccines right away I'll wait 6 months get vaccine. tell bring home doggie bags go weekend. accept that.

My point? Nothing really funny story. Rand Paul [not real board certified never was. essentially created certification board (unaffiliated known accrediting body) could certify *himself*. Then, years afterward, dissolved body. union trash. need know them. unions bad unions good. Nice expert diarrhea see. Easy solution, shut revoke business licenses permanently. mechanisms feds wanted use them. example highway speed limits enforced feds state level withholding DOT funds non-compliant states. stood courts. Millennial here, ain't first rodeo. right? unlucky group lost income got $1200 never got 600/month got shat expending basically savings. 1,200 months would life changing. T-cells produce sterilizing immunity. People T-cells still get infected.  Severity illness likely lower, people still get sick, virus still replicate body still transmit it. searched low-brow Polish medical joke, realized even (barely) that. He's wimp like president. think cares. rolled right ad hominem, even good one that. Yes, states sent mail vote ballots registered voters, Texas, COVID-19 valid reason.

My understanding sick, need doctor's note able request vote mail. know Texas going special process got sick vote mail request window closed.

I'm going guess unfortunate folks quarantine might either luck break quarantine able vote, either early Election Day.

My county drive in/by voting, guess could potentially ""safer"" way might think exposed vote. safety level determined level PPE poll workers access wear.

I hope everyone able vote ""voice"" heard.

It really hard.

Sigh....

Cheers! think dude manilpulate Trump stop pandemic president. He'd walked politically. Argentina put contact tracing? prepare isolation facilities? build PPE reserves? implement mass testing?

If answer no, wonder locking alone work. Lock downs magic solution, like masks alone aren't. Haha. Good stuff. Thanks. shut one study gave drug hospitalized patients...there still studies drug patients earlier stage continue.

I sort wonder gave hospitalized patients begin with. thought pretty well established later stages Covid characterized cytokine storm... basically overactive immune response. Giving Lilly drug, supposed boost immune system even more, seems counter-intuitive. hope numbers stay low won’t. They’ll climb people realize live virus trying balance life/economy... shit, start something 2nd time 1st time over.

when ever 1st time American Australia amazing hear many restrictions followed honor system Victoria. hard see happen US. far feel government come across trustworthy that's partly think people respect more. would lost without you. go bed tonight, sleep easy, hard work pay dividends. u/timetravelhunter, real hero. We’ve told months “wait vaccine, go back normal.” think people going keep mitigation measures vaccine out, you’re taking crazy pills. goalposts can’t move yet without society completely revolting. rate Cards Humanity 25 days Christmas Carols Senators COVID 2x people didn’t vote people? Fuck them? Fantastic news blame one bit. leaders people charge city get fking kicked outta city, don't. lol. Ah VA. Giving Americans second chance die country. instead caging children border put business owners jail hiring illegal immigrants...

It's almost like there's pattern. mention it’s really memory cells help fight it, anti-bodies olympics never happen give gold medals give him? make new one up?  Trump reason anyone thinks Dr. Fauci remotely partisan. supposed finally take trip summer I've cancel year since 2018...Ive delay MSc defense semester, can't even celebrate lab...as soon vaccine distributed demographic I'm getting jab. Lol apparently actually system  obviously idea talking about. one take money stock market would put it? Yes! confused.  flawed model Where's good news tag? primary donors corporations foundations setup rich people. carry advertising lowkey (""AGM: Supermarket World"") instead ramming face bloody way media does. Keep mind isn’t combination therapy, it’s single antibody. dual antibody approach performed better. saying combination therapy help hospitalized people either, personally think that’s late, might better single approach stopped. hope 😭  65 able vote mail, 65 older valid reason.

For otherwise qualify vote mail, option vote person.

I hope everyone goes votes early, Texas last day vote early 30th. 

I think voting Election Day going mess, people either choosing able social distance. 

I think might take trip local polling location Election Day, see things better worse expect.

I really care people vote, want everyone chance vote happen conditions outright dangerous.

Cheers! That's guess... figure ought crack large gatherings mandate masks public. Let's get lol. many people protesting dying? I'm turning right wrong, Left vs Right, Republican vs Democrat thing, virus really dangerous claim, protesting allowed? I'm talking rioting Police force reacting, I'm talking actual peaceful protests. allowed? virus dangerous spreads like wildfire, protesting allowed all? BL really M, thing say? mattered would stop prevent ""large gatherings"" right? 

I heartless say 200k+ people died acceptable loss, issue less 3% contracted virus actually died worldwide, yet encourage allow protests blame certain people white house virus control. 

The Governor's allow states city's host large gatherings call riots call peaceful protests states also dealing increased numbers cases. California example. LA showed shots protests major streets flooded sea people protesting, currently accumulatively not, sure which, 914,000 cases Governor California trying tell people can't gather holidays. government problem protests, turkey dinner family not? 

One last thing urge consider. virus actually severe led believe, hearing extermination homeless population. absolute first effected virus?

Since collective nation decide protesting streets important working supporting families? least enough bail Wall Street, bad citizens stuff biggest upward redistribution wealth American history. robbery ended 2008 implosion like knocking kid's lemonade stand compared economic rearrangement that's happened last 11 months. many months saying this? Life dangerous. Nobody gets alive. Sigh thing test trace protects known. A/presymptomatic transmission requires mitigation conditions uncertainty. masks important (and Taiwanese put large numbers straight away). think really say one important purposes different. 

We good experimental evidence, no, epidemiological evidence. fair turn news Election Day......kind like we’d stop testing much lol one mention flu vaccine first place.

the name game ""get one best immune response"" ""find one works best"" that's always same. we'll see pretty quickly ones vaccines work ones actually preventing virus least making less severe get it. also luckily multiple countries play discussion many currently breaks may even quickly see X number cases among participants write efficacy make up, that’s literally do. disregard reality, science plain logic need fill void something else, conspiracy theories it. topic whether children (especially young children) major vector hot since February. 

One early studies: (which found infections age 10 despite significant exposure city Vo)

It absolutely clear Covid19 affects children different way affects adults: disease much lighter less common children (that's major difference cold &amp; flu) unreasonable expect carriers less infectious. bamlanivimab 

who picks names? difference closing book stores grocery stores though. level risk customers employees. one essential life.

In OP's example, one ""essential"" (those low paid ""essential"" workers need actually *get* work) whereas literally one going die can't go church bit. Especially technology makes virtual services easy. 

So uncle *technically* correct, he's still complete dumbass seem understand certain businesses allowed stay open. he's touch thinks bus riders ""just get car"". read polish ? amateur far kids little nook seem okay, actually seen bus pick drop weekish. might chance Huxley stopped person classes. again, could missing it. shamelessly self-righteous moralizing can't fucking stand. people want turn blind eye suffering human beings, it; nothing new there.

But balls people sub viciously assault moral character *anyone everyone* disagrees whilst supporting [policies literally causing children starve fucking unbelievable.

Avoiding humanity totally way eliminate risk flu.

Most people would benefit flu shot. Depending year, types strains prevalent well predicted strains, reduce chances catching flu 40-60%. catch it, it’s less likely severe. “It’s flu” easily mean truly miserable ten days time hospital severe complications like sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, heart problems.

I’d happily get yearly shot reduction risk. mom actually broke rib coughing flu induced pneumonia. 50 time. feeling like I’d struck buried truck full flaming asphalt two weeks flu twenties, get shot every year.

Jesus. many times see this. socially isolate. consider introvert. still spent lot time outdoors friends family, cookouts outdoors, visited people beach park. visit two family members, kept distance wore masks.

...but know, muh freedoms wear mask all. reminds George Burns fair, students don’t work *with* COVID patients. should’ve clarified that. (Rough day, sometimes type fast miss key points.) Big floor, multiple wings, one used COVID wing least one wing full. 

However, even though don’t work them, talk nurses do, well aware many are, walk past (closed-door) rooms (in PPE) times, see fast floor filling displacing regular med-surg patients elsewhere.

Like honestly wanted know things disliked lol. dislike something explain why. pint seems worse now. new high counts. actually see new wave starting. don’t get semantics point.

But impression US government incompetent can't even hide incompetence. brutally clear idea solve crisis, there's criminally negligent, malicious, attitude many towards citizens.

Now USA grossly incompetent government crisis (we've seen plenty year), damn - former superpower fallen I'm told: one ventilated, takes staff care one. Poland went brrrr real hard think overlapping waves like stormy weather ocean waves coming every direction. appreciate summary points. rules tilted nature excluding schools districts IMO.

In Denver area alone 250,000 students attend K-12 daily basis according enrollment numbers estimates say roughly 20% students remote. even 200K people gather, mingle, head back home parents, siblings, grandparents. 

Seems like bit Grand Canyon gloss state. Might safe bet significantly infections points schools alone every single business put together. Oh know thinks “right person” No, tend pretty compliant populations. government tells something generally it.

Koreans, Thais, Hong Kongers would disagree difference number wave make?! I've never seen someone (them you) deflect hard simple question asking information think definitely making point. 

I saying last paragraphs generally gloomy tone compared rest.  immunologist charge Warp Speed says he's pretty confident we'll least one 75-90% effectiveness range can’t say legally, involves horse, priest, Tennessee moonshine. ❄️ Dude, calm read said. lock down, said much. lock helped us eliminate virus, **no longer lockdown**. original comment lock **for 12 months**, lock all. Bars make people sloppy potentially lax. Although hate say small businesses close. could allow temporarily close financially support closure. course, ideal solution across board, obviously complicated. complicated. 

But appreciate discussion today.

Edit: mean close trade off. getting sleepy thinking clearly point lol accomplishes least. They're likely spreaders, and, least elderly, many potential years ahead them. Innoculating likely stop spread rapidly. *greater* good we're here? put UK government New Zealand they'd screwed. Same. California’s case count going up, down. Even scenario, normalcy still six months away. 

Also Q3 starts July. [The data support  oh they're huh?! ;) ends, would back work ends. 

I trying go back work numbers went down., soft reopen, huge spikes!

I wish work people directly Everyone it. cell immunity applies viral infections humans, SARS COV2. human body typical cell response coronavirus like every virus challenges body. There's nothing special virus save novel. crazy, one random guy collapses street, could heart attack, stroke, could simply fainted. like happened else world. Picture swimming pool filled people. lanes pool less people explosive diarrhea, they're part US Olympics-sized swimming pool. 

This underrated comment Reddit today Lol that's immature comment. world outside America, 95% countries failed simple thing think could done stop it. Many destroyed economies imposed awful restrictions daily life attempt describe ""simple thing"" could stop all. Turns simple.  lockdown you’ve claimed both.

We know locked quit pretending butt hurt called it. YES! time made point got downvoted oblivion.

If job beginning, situation now. 3-4 weeks lockdown early without whining economy masks political statement, would back semi-normal. People care though. calculated numbers Germany. 5 weeks away Poland 7 weeks away counting number beds supposedly turned ICU. Edgy say disappearing they're gone thats wrong. That's misinformation. They're disappearing. Hypocrites temperature checks would actually made big difference.

Exactly. Temp checks security theatre dealing COVID. asymptomatic carrier fever sure hell spread around. I... thats part makes issue complex think max 6th?

Just really hit America. people could wearing mask supposed got sick 'loser' wasnt. “Can’t multiple waves first one never ends!”


-America whine want US, end day relying 365million people incredibly divided country socially distanced wear masks never going work. never sustainable strategy. 

And also EU experiencing huge surges like us, again, US problem. true trump signed executive order able fire Fauci? read fake news? Pray mamon! think need send vehicles ... OH, STUPID CHINESE LIVING WEST ILLUSION. Well shit. usa, basically. difference make? went zero, went again. That's wave hit ground. hey, wants call first wave that's fine too. end result exact same. USA much Lower average population density. Let's hope Virginia Tech comes fancy experiments there. personally handle public spaces like invisible ink somewhere want bring ink face inside home. dose makes poison, imagine handling contaminated packages day, btw Amazon 20k infected workers since march, that's that. think depends group smaller. I'd assume elderly immunocompromised count smaller group everyone else think best vaccinate first. Boy escalated quickly haha... dropping F-bombs, much Canadian politeness.

It condescending say people town smarter people cities. took rose-coloured glasses, would see ignorant people small towns example, 73-year-old man entered grocery store without mask small town rural county. asked wear one, refused assaulted several people inside. Upon leaving, got vehicle tore parking lot, damage outside store, speeding off. Provincial police pursued fatally shot residence.

There people across Canada care others. Look anti-mask brought number cases rant, compare apples apples. Within 100 km US-Canadian border, cases Canadian side American side. Time get high horse realize shared culture two countries. ignorant folks North America. see highschoolers issue types behaviors. also understand teenagers age immature rebellious yet crave social interaction. tough them. whole issue needs thoughtful consideration. adhering guidelines even lockdowns? 

I dont know answers, definitely important discussion. There's enough cases moment, let's financially incentivize people get infected. I’m 56 year old widower self isolated since February. still hanging it’s getting harder every day. convinced soon let guard get it. /thread wants voted office get hired restaurant? Well, yeah. Ugh, people make angry.

Staff always great there, popcorn always good too. It’s smaller, seats less inclined, go see movies near end run location.

There patrons wearing onesies giggling movie started, kinda cute annoying ten minutes in. opening credits started going frequently, per five minutes. Really killed vibe, started using emergency exit, propping open.

My wife tells she’s enough, go leave, manager bumps us, *hands us 4 passes free movies* here, people suck, set fire alarm twice already.” leaving police pulling up. didn’t realize smoking outside movie big deal.

I see Russia!! know covering someone, somewhere! Pool's... closed? R0 overall case load got low felt comfortable going stores reopened, course masks limited occupancy. personally gone anywhere like 3 months. Seeing numbers shrink stay low really nice, allowed us (altered) sense normalcy again. they're creeping back I'm becoming much wary again. never let guard totally again, knowing numbers lower safer nice feeling.

China fascist regime (real ""waaaah trump meanie fascist""), get stuff control fast. First sight anti mask / anti lockdown protests everyone there's going prison. haven’t store business since March. Haven’t within 6 feet anyone except husband, person gave covid test (my husband emergency thought could exposed him), person collected drop-off ballot. frustrating. longest TL;DR ever . lol. nice found ctrl+a ctrl+c ctrl+v. :D idiots who,didn’t know talking about. mean, PM federal government would never first nationwide lockdown them, compares way- states forced them, came party money support people couldn’t work. yeah, like trump I’ll wait happen cases still rising Canada? thought masks mandatory there?

Here U.S live, I'd say half refuse wear mask. they're fucking lazy. 

I'm beyond angry. saying 99.6% survival rate? saying global lock virus less dangerous flu justified? seriously hope joking....lmao. guess scared monsters closet well. believe study refering bit:

Well, people still can't get rid ideological context, predicted never able control virus. world, doctors noticed Covid often accompanied familiar shortness breath coughing affect body, also huge range conditions hitting brain – foggy thinking, delirium, way strokes serious Britain that, pandemic took hold early year, doctors set monthly committee coordinate reports brain disorders.

and oil gas sector got money. Services may operate 25% posted occupancy limit, exceed 25 people, per room.

What they'll block 75% seating places, meaning end may operate 25% posted occupancy limit indoors exceed 50 people excluding staff, whichever less, per room.

See worship Life Rites may operate 25% 50 people. outdoor worship services, house worship must maintain 6 feet distance non-household members

Ditto. Outdoor services social distancing events may operate 50 percent capacity 25 people, whichever fewer.

There indoor events all. recreation centers indoor pools authorized open in-person services; virtual services may provided.

Good. Buy recreational activities groups 10 people fewer may occur, maintaining 6 feet Distancing Requirements between

Again, pandemic.

Lane County, Oregon here. seeing problem (other business owners response, is).  intend tell freezing 4°C. wanted say virus viable several weeks low temperatures. No, implies places hit twice. peaks first wave correspond different areas country seeing massive numbers cases (Northeast, South, Midwest). he's saying ""semantics"" people implying. He's saying places hit seen second wave yet. NYC example could see larger worse version saw spring. apparently study refer to: young, low-risk population ongoing symptoms, almost 70% individuals impairment one organs four months initial symptoms SARS-CoV-2 infection. implications burden long COVID also public health approaches assumed low risk young people comorbidities. Cant second wave you’re still first wave. Big brain move America. Right, intention. Lol Dr Fauci, massive fearmongerer tries make headlines every sentence says. change that. Yes! time need scientists epidemiologists said last lock Trump completely bungled even try accomplish: ramp testing, set robust contact tracing program, open 2 weeks declining cases.

Then need able test randomly, targeted testing well. need able stamp small fires. Right still inferno. one time Federal response makes complete sense. People move state state interact communities. states budget states have, yet richer states infect people poorer states. time need one leader one plan get everyone page. Can’t second wave never leave first. Problem solved. can't pandemic reaches young people. Sooner later, unless contained, find way old. Also, trust numbers taken July, especially numbers March/April wave. Back then, testing sickest people hospital. tests mainly reserved old, expect also find cases old. reason believe younger people back got Covid lower rate old. Everyone went daily activities normally March, everybody would chance get it. 225K dead says otherwise probably talking individual states. live NJ flattened curve great numbers summer rough March, April, May. entering definite second wave. gotten control, numbers great. Maybe like states, live states impacting much here, life went pretty okay summer.

We 100% entering second wave here, idgaf people want say country whole area matters national trends, area impacts greatest living matters daily life. Also, governor taken seriously me, done great job. seriously hope joking. 2009 entered chat

Are you... serious?? Like, honestly... genuinely think H1N1 2009 even remotely comparable Covid 19? I'm completely baffled even trying say here. Wikipedia says H1N1 2009 killed 3,433 people US TOTAL earth comparing something easily killed 225,000 nowhere close done?

*September 2020 least deadly month ever Sweden, least far back data SCB:s public database provides data. 63.07 deaths per 100 000 people September 2020, previous record low 64.24 June 2019, 65.13 June 2018.*

Indeed interesting numbers, believe cancelling surgeries, cancer screenings, still letting people go doctor might influence numbers. gut feeling matter. Fact remains little science pointing toward children main driver pandemic. ""just listen science"" sub, topic anecdotal evidence apparently important. keep stupid friends? honestly single person like friend group. fine. Stop coddling killers. Politicians share immense blame, failure critical thinking skills individual level excuse. wasted 6+ months. really hard, doubt. I’m lucky enough wife able stay home, I’m also seeing first hand bad it’s going get area. We’re cusp first major outbreak area. Every day confirmation schools incapable managing coronavirus response. Coronavirus touching special areas. feel violated. Autocracies effective times crisis Clearly not. many articles seen whether we're first wave nth wave point? terms locked source income, there's really difference two. Well duh America. amount time chose this. That's crazy bit. Wear mask. Wash fucking hands. Social distance. Avoid groups numbers come down. matter time vacation available. fucking take let antivaxers fall edge flat world. Funny countries far right gov'ts similar troubles... wonder link is? Seeing lower bar 50 000 000 3 000 pretty quickly quite interesting. That's statistically significant fact. Oh course happen happen again.

It's perfectly preventable though, travel sick wear masks.

Also article seems bit clickbaity big assumptions like people caught plane particular 13 infected people begin with. nice you, bad didn’t make guess. Problem counterfeits still exists. Two quick tests read: easily light mask fire water drops poured bead roll right off, mask likely counterfeit. feel best buy large, well-established workplace safety houses buyers familiar reputable supply chain sources. Workplace safety rating medical safety, difference performance impact. Midwest soon follow. hope. antibody test won’t unblind you: 

* it’s positive, either got covid vaccine worked, got placebo got exposed virus community, got covid vaccine didn’t work got exposed virus anyway 
* it’s negative, either got covid vaccine didn’t work, got placebo

You can’t tell sure whether test control group antibody test result. clinical trial people would interested antibody test result too. 

Also - yet proven scientific standards immune response *effective* immune response. Positive antibodies necessarily mean immune. point phase III trials, show whether vaccine actually beats disease - know works fragments virus lab conditions it’s big step say actually stops covid. parents vulnerable continue stay away, hard is. (They trial might home straight authorisation ain’t til it’s over). create barrier air vents?  Anti-HBs Hep B vaccine half life 9 months. usually considered effective 10 years. humoral immunity mostly gone, cellular immunity persists. CDCs recommend revaccination point, deem cellular response strong enough. occupational exposure risk, booster usually recommended.

And mentioned rate decline usually depends initial response (2X even more). strong response lead higher initial Ab titer, could also decrease slower. [This shows [the decline anti-HBs among 225 Hep B vaccine honestly looks like random scatter plot me. perfect world, triage would work something like this: go party? Attend gathering? Go pub? Hang beach thousands others?

Yes?

Get fuck out. 

Next! argument DAE cant 2 waves stay first one? ? haha america #1! Guess victory lap took last month early. problem, lock downs need met financial welfare they’ve forced income. term wave made up. Viruses like wildfires spread new areas/people. 

If look 1918 flu geographic location, places crushed early didn’t really large second spikes (philly) everyone got it. places put restrictions/had time prepare opening/closing waves. later better since rate transmission became lower (possibly treatments became better), point virus burned got got.

History repeating itself. places got burned (NY particular) aren’t massive second death spikes. Meanwhile re-emerging Europe continuing move around US. Fatality rates lower March due treatment knowledge. population approaching herd immunity, death rate been? would interesting statistic..  Suicides risen year year. It'll really fascinating see one vaccine performs far better others. example, Pfizer elicits CD4+ Oxford better B cells. know you, people work year here. 100% schools. weather barely even changed here, difference schools. peak go down? Yes, waves. still acting surprised churches? kind knuckle-dragging, ape brain mentality dealing with??

Put fucking mask, idiots. age/risk category good you, ones are. prevent deaths, job loss, school closures, shut downs.

Otherwise pandemic going go on. Pisses off. You’re assuming important issue American people election COVID. Plenty people concerned economy, police violence, racism, abortion, healthcare, guns, etc. That's great. change fact happened happen again. Things clear. 2 regions affected first wave Paris area north east. Paris badly affected second wave, north east bad areas, situation still deteriorating curfew several départements.  17% oof.... true, US third wave, called wave looks diagram, peaks goes goes peaks etc called wave, there's special scientific definition. saw comment like three hours ago I'm still giggling. XD last one ""study"" United Airlines US Dept Defense. Obviously, sources tainted. Something like 95% vaccines fail phase 3 anyways. news like way soon unfortunately.  next thing know they'll compare wearing mask kneeling. That's science action. want eliminate risk, that:eliminate risk. convenient, necessary truly want push risk lowest level practical flight. Whatever helps sleep night. hair following strict protocol kept clients safe since June. I’m bragging invincible masks hand washing, wiping workspace schedule helps lot. would recommend ecolab consistency far cleaning products fast effective always stock. Good hear, good back mate. Fucking EXACTLY. saying months now. Like, plateaus rises equal waves. Rises, plateaus, \*falls\* (which we've measure rises) equal waves. mean, right name. Wave. ""Try"" would appropriate here. wish best I'll try best. miss live music, you’d expect. job literally relies it, along sports. Japan done incredible job? barely anything numbers bad compared NZ. mention true success stories Vietnam instead? Lumping Japan together NZ NZ disservice. Florida lot better. Masks everywhere. Tbf, Fauci said expects “some form normalcy” Q4 2020. He’s either lying means adjusted normal- there’s way shaking it. honest, past even slightly harsher flu season could overwhelm hospitals. idiots government decided need use summer come coherent plan. asked day got downvoted oblivion. Apparently hive mind doesn’t understand pandemics work. health others by-product precautions, main thrust remain virus free. high? worst idea Melbournian here. tough. Still is. I'm glad fortunate enough work home trivia holiday, 400,000 people Victoria lost jobs, lot harder.

I've work since March 25th international borders closed. savings emergency fund run out, I'm borrowing money friends pay bills. I'm hopeful work go back soon, working international airlines makes concrete. 

I can't afford service car, can't afford buy new clothes I've put little bit weight, I've antidepressants suicidal entire year. eaten anything pasta rice recently, nights make toast sandwich save money.

I also moved year, live 5km friends family. live within 5km three people know, two nice people, housemate. past 3.5 months, seen family friends person last week.

I would again, think best course action, dismissing bad really disrespectful privileged position take. us work jobs either can't transferred home needed lockdown environment really suffered. mention small businesses. You’d surprised many people need eat something frequently health reasons though friends absolutely genuinely think vaccine ploy track them, somehow involving Bill Gates. can't believe people genuinely buy shit, let alone people know. want say, ""you can't fucking worried tracked anyways, carry cellphone update facebook religiously - literally give info want, need put fucking chip you"" probably best response. France, places hit first wave places less hit second.

Given Paris greater Paris region hit hard waves find difficult believe. know, priorities. Covid worst thing world happen you. state big problems Alabama lead way. Yeah, takes courage step that. would imagine acting stage would like first time. got lot stares laughter sporting half face respirator. might start using cases increase. I've using N95 times mask mandated prudent. percentage population infected starts climb, N95 leaves 5% gap caught P100 HEPA filtering half-face respirator. pandemic taught anything, public health people really, really bad jobs. 8 months later still managed communicate risk management works. Natural herd immunity talked politicians public thing literally chance ever happening despite effectively unheard human history simple SEIR model shows reasonable virus parameters covid never reaches herd immunity. still huge fixation hand washing surface cleaning appear major spread vector. CDC recently begrudgingly admitted obvious truth covid least partially aerosol spreading disease despite clear months now. Seemingly every day see headline still first wave thing remotely matters. yet see media article gives remotely realistic timeline vaccine approval deployment. Probably think point clear regardless. Typically around 3 days 6 days land. false negatives quite high earlier that.  I'll also quarantine get results. Thankfully labs pretty fast would hope would full storming bastille moment end would probably rednecks kidnapping governors. Exactly this. even second wave, people caring anymore. store opened local area Sweden around 600 people there. one cared, guards, nada. aw cmon! worked maybe 10 days first lockdown NZ, driving fairly long distance large city. 

I get pulled - think even saw cop.

It mostly honour system unless blatant. Tread carefully, though: USA, dozens people shot question ""Mask Mask"" least three governors threatened detailed plans abduction case mask mandate.

In Germany mostly non-lethal violence couple days ago main building Robert-Koch-Institut (roughly comparable version Center Disease Control) attacked Molotov Cocktails. Airborne isn’t binary yes/no. There’s airborne like measles (will fill room land every surface), there’s airborne like Covid (12-15 feet), there’s airborne like originally though covid like (3-6 feet).

I'm going share article her. gonna sound heretical subreddit oh well...Disney world probably place outside apartment feel thoroughly safe lol.

So far, knowledge cases caused Disney World. 

I'm passholder went one evening weeks opened friend kinda walk around see looked like. 

I've gone 3 times, I'm done foreseeable future, truly genuinely say Disney stricter preventative measures hospital work at. 

They extremely strict social distancing, masks, regularly wiping everything, etc etc. Attendance capped far less use point busiest hour day right now, less busy hour close pre-covid. 

The reason feels safe reducing measures even though florida gov said so. sticking scientific advisors. 

The parks genuinely feel safe right now. place feel less chance getting covid apartment [THE PRESIDENT DENIED FEELING UNWELL ACTED SUPER Get damn high horse stop denying sometimes people make dumb fucking choices, sometimes pay price. 

If vote people push bullshit lies false science, LIKE GET VOTE FOR. Pretty much nobody Nordic wearing masks. personality disorders? What? It’s killed 225000 people less year, US. That’s lot fatality rate much higher flu. 

No serious person fearmongering it. take calculated risks going out, way take calculated risks driving: wear set belt don’t drink drive know traffic going particularly problematic try avoid going out. similar wearing mask, avoiding large, dense crowds limiting indoor exposures people.

I’ve known 2 people died maybe 6 total virus. One six seriously fucked many weeks.

Because know approximate hospitalization, ifr, cfr rates positive % rate total positive numbers area useful. Look El Paso right now. moved earlier growing case numbers might 100% hospital capacity right now.

Look, honestly don’t give single fuck all. Go tongue kiss next positive person find, don’t give shit I’m going continue try convince take seriously. good day.

sh!tsta!ns floors... works retire Chad memes Trump dancing stage village people proudly proclaiming may immune know strawman. It'll take 8 months vaccinate everyone nation, average, unless extraordinary measures taken. Yep. Considering asymptomatic mild symptoms many people have, could already, get infected later worse they're tested thinking first time. reported outbreak fairly highly populated east coast city weeks ago, shut entire city, tested believe tens thousands.

They also shut section Beijing long ago (maybe two months?) US increased combat aircraft production five-fold year 1941, 1500 almost 8500, make adequate supply chain certified masks *for health-care workers alone* nine months. 

An effort would paid itself....

They even try. 

 hard see failures every level fact. point give let idiots catch virus? like choice anymore know. Constitution Court (or however spelled EN) ruled woman cannot abort fetus damaged syndrome sort confirmed, direct threat life hits. head behind ruling already pushing further, made illegal abort pregnancy rape.

Poland shitshow now. rest society pretty much prior point, society paying attention what's going schools. teachers would fudge ever living shit grades get kids across finishing line tremendous administration pressure.

Can't anymore pandemic kid literally turn anything though. kids nothing now, kids pretty much nothing school passed along anyways. straight teachers experience day day basis. public gets see first hand hell actually going school. get vaccinated then. want lose ability cook good food start enjoy warm beer. ;-) “Please stay home.” kidding me? California's current lockdown literally restrictive U.S. Rand Paul joke doctor theory US population wide spread mental disorders stemming years years working long hours idolizing money. lived 17 years NYC often see people snap working around many people.

US needs mental day relax regroup imo mercury / lead poisoning? second wave? first wave end new one come right? We’ve pretty much accepted virus learned live apart daily life rather take necessary steps contain eliminate it. government decided best course action ride hope goes away good man, lots people live example Chad ChAdOx1 vs virgin moderna r/covid19 good discussion also quite reposts here, unfortunately none seem study itself, news articles reporting it. Errr - probably already virus moment immune point whatsoever wearing mask social distancing etc.
They longer infectious longer virus
They safest people around you! already 24 confirmed reinfections (about half severe first time) several hundred confirmed genome sequencing: 


 Haha don’t think conspiracy theorists idea rDNA is. major structure fire block last night. literally person though “hmm maybe N95 would good idea” zero neighbours wore masks, even though hood reeks like burnt diesel. People dumb general. ....Says boy; playing manure pile. 😂 Damn sounds nice, eating outside breeze fave. Stay safe kudos, buddy! stay home/lockdown orders teeth. See areas world lockdowns worked? studying implementing ever want get back normal. Short term pain, long term gain. shove it. Scientists in Brazil have linked resistance to Covid-19 safety measures, wearing a mask, antisocial personality traits.

That hilarious. Msk crusaders ones locked basements past seven months. Anti makers actually get stuff, hence reason like wearing msks yep. people think differently. 

A strategy would market mask wearing ways resonate less ""empathic"" types empathic types seem responded community safety message emotional appeal.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean goal get people wear masks public good.  Sadly NHS NI bad position even covid yes, I’m quite sure cases risen astronomically (bar conspiracy theorist nonsense you’ve already highlighted), Derry Strabane Council Area went one best rates one worst virtually overnight areas seeing huge rises too. *Schadenfreude* know. That's find silly many people, US least, freak wear mask. Find one that's comfortable forget even on. different putting hat scarf shoes. ah. great philosopher time discovered! Lol think so.. live NJ. I'm touching vaccine year available. gimmie gimmie gimmie. Vote 2020. Current leadership gone herd immunity route empathy. context: 

10M doses

5M vaccinated double dose needed

36M population 

6% 65 (2.1M)

So enough healthcare workers over-65s end January, well large proportion pre-existing conditions. That's turd wave co-vid Get everyone pool, empty it, clean &amp; start again... Huh? live SF. carnivals... Wait minute... Americans* try looking want: That, plus lot resistance public. cafe closed good? I’d love come spend money open tomorrow possible. 

Fuck Murdoch. might aiming high. I'd settle Canadian point. Plus low testing means missed alarming moment. Spike probably started weeks before. Notice, testing improved (and still sucks) deaths piked. Well, bad outcome rare young people, virus would matter millions people got it... personality disorder wearing mask mostly fine me, sometimes body temp skyrockets start sweating feel like im gonna pass go outside take mask ok.

Anecdotal af type anal-log-orgy wish.....? culture slimiest cutthroat bastards receiving praise adoration millions? Can't see causality 5 37 million year quite impressive, demographics, would include everyone 50 people high risk. Lol I’ll let guinea pigs take first. Looks like plenty y’all comments No. You’ll need stay locked inside house probably rest life. Media headlines chauk full misinformation run world.  What's I'm hearing lately study suggesting immunity lasts 3 months? see reference sub I'm wondering there's truth worried much stop spread this?

And there's strawman. takeaway even know. saying means saying spread misinformation. nice day. Thanks, one surplus deaths among young people US (especially NY area). 
 
I thinking UK-study showing high levels organ damage. Unfortunately true :(

I hope people come :)

My heart breaks them, wish would tell stay strong fight on. Seems like death wish me. Hopefully shitstorm blow faces.

Sadly, we'll end splashed time. issue farming pretty complex nuanced. Food production within country essential falls national security. opinion, farmer issue. consumers want cheapest food possible combined businesses want make money. Without government subsidies illegal immigrants paid minimum wage food costs would double minimum. disproportionately affects low income people. system likely people/corporations middle making bit much money. also haven’t really maxed healthcare system places... yet.

Once happens, we’ll see deaths skyrocket. antibodies. still them.

Not necessarily. Memory B cells survive express immunoglobulin decades. Neutralizing antibodies found **serum** 1918 flu survivors, 90 years identified panel 32 subjects aged 91-101 years (i.e., aged 2 12 years 1918), many recalled sick family member household pandemic, suggested direct exposure virus. subjects tested, 100% exhibited **serum neutralizing activity** 1918 virus (mean titer 1:562), 94% serologic reactivity 1918 HA (as indicated hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) titers 1:40 greater; mean titer 1:396), even though samples obtained nearly 90 years pandemic.

Source: mean lost ability fight virus encounter strain again.

Vaccine-induced immunity tend generate weaker immune response. Inactivated virus vaccine may elicit cell memory, B cell defense recruited. case, fading antibodies indicate fading B cell memory equates fading immunity. anything confirms first second wave, already turd wave distance learning 14 year old, one best friend sees rarely, best friend wfh parents. It’s going fine. grades better last year. hurry whatsoever schools reopen. I’m California. Bless governor Newsom. Taking lot heat he’s standing ground tiered opening. AMERICA FIRST! 🇺🇸 Korea 3 cases total deaths. part bad response? AiR tRaVeL SpReAD CoViD

People masks time never take eat drink /s never know went through. pretty similar read No, misinformation.

Canada one hardest hit countries comes SARS. Even US relatively high number cases comes overall ranking total cases.

The whole ""Asians prepared SARS"" bullshit argument based false narrative westerners form excuse. hope one dies.

What terrible thing wish someone. doctor said mylanta adalimumab. Side effects include... work , headache, constipation, numbness lungs right eye, wrong occasional death someone's birthday, wedding cousin coming gay. side effects redness eyes loss little bell thing got like right end mouth. know one I'm talking about. operate heavy equipment lunesta mylanta adalimumab. People taking lunesta reported seeing shit, virgin Mary uncle John, one twice removed mom's side. could drop 0 Republicans still back stimulus. goal see country burn collapse, amount anything voting stop them. No, won’t. Nah shutting public schools give educational voucher families. Let hire private tutor small bubble 4-5 families. teachers union course protest this, opinion absolutely worthless longer protest effectively schools closed anyway. think worth reiterating many concentric travel restrictions imposed Melbourne, Victoria, may explain success, also may make hard duplicate:

* Australia island nation isolated rest world (with NZ let back recently)
* Victoria state isolated rest Australia.
* Melbourne city isolated rest Victoria.
* People allowed travel 5 km home (now extended 25 km). Lol gave trying tell people this. bring lockdowns mask mandates say don’t work, explain literally nobody took serious one side political spectrum. plenty us tried, finally started venturing month three, you’d see douchebag assholes full maskless families Costco Target. 

It took awhile, Inslee got shit pretty control. look states realize country fucked. I've NY CA NY FL essential circumstances. roughly 5.5 hours+ 1.5 hours departing airport 30 min arriving. I'm 100% familiar euro rating , use 3M 1860S series. green 3M N95's healthcare providers. get moist all. additionally carry several backups case straps fail. honest try use bathroom, I'm adequately protected. key EXTREMLY mindful hand hygiene since high touch surfaces. layered protection helps lot, even exposed , viral load would likely drastically lower. come anyway. Lots wilderness tourist areas US packed, every asshole thinks isolated vacation safe region. would lock give us money could understand want lock give us middle finger guys harsh lockdown also spring? might Italy hard time right now. Mate, Covid doesn’t kill, causes serious lingering ongoing health issues people ages. saaaaaaameq know this. That's keep saying vaccine around corner moving goalposts. respiratory, can't cure it. End of. hospital go to? 2009 novel H1N1 declared pandemic, one year 1990s measles killed 2.6 million worldwide. article July, we've known awhile decreases antibodies mean decreased immunity. Nah. White collar childless employees best time lives. Stocks/401k growing, low interest rates let upgrade better house, work remote travel more. Rich people even better time, use cash buy businesses pennies dollar exploit government assistance businesses. 

But bottom 80% society truly fucked over. Yang gang wya ""Flying penis spreads Rona"" FIFY  I'm saying neighbor right...but, understand. great great uncle died Spanish flu 3rd year US government already subsidizing farms, turn employs tons illegal workers keep costs lower. technically government needs immigrants keep subsidized costs well. really want talk part. Thanks posting this. What? Victoria eliminate virus?

No, it’s still around...  increase month October, even entered winter yet. really appreciate , need thank me! figured right thing do, since precautions I'm taking backed science.  Also, I'll add would extremely hypocritical studying medicine , take steps protect health people around me. I'll never forget everyone looked early March wearing PPE. like disgusted sight me. among nervous I've ever been, fully packed 737, one else masks. must say delta jet blue absolutely fantastic ensuring mask compliance. That's lot people suffering. matter. well-funded system Poland Covid white people's fault. Governments around world shut public schools given vouchers parents hire teachers small private bubbles 4-5 families time, greatly reducing risk. Putting 30 kids one class obviously disaster. quite, Fraser Health also includes everything south Fraser too. Surrey, Burnaby, Delta places driving transmission province right now. parent's defense... kids never shit pool... Even swim diapers. family best increase fecal frenzy. 's serious plan. good.

how long flights?
can FFP2 FFP3 mask worn longer 2h without collecting moisture losing efficacy?
I thought ""breaks"" dry out...

BTW, opinion using bathroom flight? great article.

It creates impression 59 infected plane. 13 cases plane, later infected 46 others.

How many 13 infected plane known either. several, seems unlikely, according original paper eurosurveillance.

What known certainty infected people plane. Beyond more-or-less educated guessing. JApan harsh lockdowns. Restaurants.  Bars restaurants open. know hard small family owned businesses, cannot eat drink mask on. Going business don’t eat drink entirely different ballgame, everyone mostly protected mask. Look many, many restaurants open that’s going riskier area. Oh shut put another shrimp barbie.

From jealous american surrounded non mask wearing idiot americans thinks everything conspiracy. take awhile roll vaccine.

I imagine restrictions huge crowds concerts sports games could last quite bit, forever. ego? I'm trying make lot things work out? think Trump took position. say cult, though. normal antibodies viruses fade time? 

the important piece whether memory B cells remember pathogen produce antibodies faster infected again. would documented reinfections rare mostly asymptomatic Yeah going too. Yeah... still 3 overflow sites, one really large, went ""We've got pretty well hand to"" ""Oh-shit-oh-fuck"" really damn quick. 3rd crest first wave mean want millions dead sure. batshit insane herd immunity approach INFLUENZA possibly million die, covid batshit insane. yet “freedom” make fun one them. Totaly agree! COVID 19 perfect practice pandemic. Maybe make humanity ready really bad one later... But, they're clearly missing freedom parrot fake news. flair alarmist garbage. I've flying 2 times week work yeah definitely safe. Everyone super crowded close waiting get plane (and airport requires take little train terminal, thats packed like sardines). plane, half people nose out, flight attendants try make mask reminder notice, like they're constantly patrolling aisle. hand snacks drinks, call covid time. Especially everyone gets thing instead asking prefer, means everyone plane gets snacks drink within 5 minute exact time basically everyone plane masks off.  Oh, know either. NHC report really say. find out? family members mine think I’m lying I’m part conspiracy

Your family. 
Thinks part conspiracy. 


no 
no I've said ""waves"" far like NFL invading country challenging city present greatest champions, cities respond sending middle school football teams thinking sheer numbers would enough win. kids stay home, realizing losing battle, kids play loyalty, parents force play, thinking it'll make look strong.

When NFL moves next city they've run children pummel waiting kids recover, ""wave."" can't claim victory team left boredom. closest solution people seem can't pandemic everyone dead.

The fact politicians killing constituents succeeding makes keep considering pointing shotgun straight firing, maybe there's sort tactical advantage shooting foot. Sorry you’re much incorrect 

Vaccine 70% effective, need things years regardless thing never going away. Ffs People like worry side effects. says nothing 50 million deaths I'm talking current day imbecile. average Chinese person right freedom average American. Yes, right that. strategy would need differences ours, totally possible get control right leadership reasonable compliance. can't stop infected Americans completely, could adopt measures similar NSW dealing border VIC. Contact tracing, quarantine testing anyone comes border, social distancing - things keep numbers low steady. California. Unfortunately, state two away masses complete ignoramuses. Article date. There’s good summary research antimicrobial properties copper cited actual studies $1500 per fortnight Oz quite think dropped back $1200 per fortnight now.
Edit: job keeper job seeker stimulus package.  What's situation now? issue wearing masks large groups people really don’t see many people pissed that. Would nice one pharma companies offered money back guarantee can’t believe significant portion country *still* resists basic, highly effective, even remotely inconvenient preventative measure. 

Universal masking avoid implement harsher lockdowns dread much. can’t people realize Milan, crowds chanted ""Freedom, freedom, freedom!"" clashed police city centre. city capital Lombardy, particularly hard hit virus.

Lombardy worst hit region world spring, people would understand importance mitigations restrictions sake health system collapsing would them. Surreal times living in. Disney World handling it? getting many cases traced there?  whipped Zoom ... accident? Robots AI take lot folks jobs next 20 years ... that’s UBI comes alternative liberties?!

 app tracking contacts 6-12 months, big bad government would know mostly staying home anyway?!

Or wear mask 30 min shop?!

Yeah, bring on! 

I'd trade keeping loved ones away virus economy almost normal level.

And someone prefers liberties act irresponsibly spread virus - sure guest. needs hospital - covid - sacrificed minor inconvenience priority. Masks won’t long term thing Americas European countries. Except occasional weirdos. got mine 60, it’s probably little less protection half face p100 respirator, don’t breathing work I’m psyched. 

I would like get badass one someday, suggestions shop brands 3M Amazon good way go? Awesome news ugh Sorry bearer bad news, never ugh Vaccines necessarily produce immunity real virus. Sometimes antigenicity even higher i.e. HPV [Oh Bless, maybe spring get level security vaccines start going public I'm really trying say effect, results impossible Canada winter colder. Staying inside away others benefits too, depending exactly many people sharing indoors with. People scream already ready held back till election sink Trump Think yearly flu shots. 

We'll getting yearly covid shots now. [Oh Additionally, people resist treatment, often using classic terms ""head shrinkers"" ""mumbo jumbo"" gonna pin force  U didnt bother look nerve say something? Smh Shit, could told that. know real number infected Poland? useful vaccine needs give years immunity, broad enough effective across wide range strains. getting immunity otherwise. Inconclusive. Almost 2 days later I'm apparently neurologically sound, mind foggy quite long time. wait tests done, take time. Heart ultrasound OK, still wait RMI, EEG, neck veins Doppler (no idea that's correct translation), cardio consult. Bush read book Spanish flu scared hell him. pandemic playbook reinforced Obama. administration listen anything. Fauci get fired ain't he? rates government controlling testing making look like waves. 

If somehow, could test entire population...2 weeks later, test again...two weeks later, test again....only understand flow growth spread. 

I gotta hand people reporting data public bet frustrated knowing it’s even bigger confirmed.

With two week incubation period, loved one becomes confirmed case, it’s two weeks late.

Instead creating supplies, might well go back school back work. Instead helping out, can’t tell anyone keep safe. 

Big brother isn’t big babysitter run big baby. Dude, Australia hologram, try go teleport Alaska. believe real. That's want think. let's swap. come Paredes de Coura Portugal, Primavera Sound Barcelona. I'll go Coachella SxSW. aside music, part fun new experiences. That's even remotely true. good. second wave lot worse course, primary benefit protecting health billions people. yet secondary 'icing cake', would love love LOVE see faces online armchair experts  Dunning-Kruger fuelled confidence obnoxiously proclaim ""There never successful coronavirus vaccine, ergo never one Sars-Cov-2"". Prisons probably lower average age population. Seatbelts also protect others Definitely Christians, also definitely one crazy cult. I'd say SK majority protestant churches quite politically conservative, among small yet non-negligible far-right extremists, among fair portion anti-maskers. Also, even anti-maskers, tend ignore social distancing church gatherings. think form ""active"" anti-mask, rather insensitive care. course kind irresponsible behaviours shrunk since gov't began sue reparation impose much stronger restrictions social gatherings.

BTW, see Korean American churches connection SK churches. know anything KA churches agenda, judged actions, actions irrelevant SK churches. incorrect. lmao, singaporean welcome come see yourself. guy obviously thinks we’re turd wave. “Asshole” still counts type personality called ""levering"" instead ""leveraging""... says lot people Facebook category. post studies like they’ll scream “fake news” you.

going cafe days funeral tradition russian roullete one, saves lot time Why?
most private public hospitals like country.

almost every hospital. find interested visit some. mask one tool. helps lot without pieces, eventually, masks help much either.

The masks reduce infections people. limits quickly infections take place.

 Testing tells us infected. 

Tracing tells us connections people infected.

Quarantine gives us ability separate infected connections non-infected.

When taken together, reduce infections single digit zero. totally defeat virus, keeps low, quickly deal every time resurges.

Just one two helps little ultimately successful. whole set actions. Thank God US already open regardless subreddit thinks it. mean, Poland. else expect shithole Summer came rescue, too. People still snack ones won’t give money, don’t want lockdown. want die. I'm catalogue batshit crazy nonsense gets posted every day.

On front, thread *huge* disappointment. Thank mansplaining basic principles liberal democracy my.  


I think misunderstood question. Sweden it’s claimed government interfere work Folkhälsomyndigheten all. would unscientific populism like in... countries. 

It’s also widely claimed economical considerations played part att strategy. 

But one central members government appear clearly state “all time” it’s “most important” find measures “balancing infection control economy”.  


This must mean either:

\- Governement indeed interfere work FoHM ensure proposed measures cost society much. 

or: 

\- Government acting outside strategy recommendations FoHM fx raise number participants events. Hopefully need fix UK economy, there's denying much we'd make selling vaccine No. Absolutely, not. I'm seeing people acting much worse. Wszystkich świętych catastrophy though. Churches still open, people probably gather en mass cementaries. already advised parents go day, light candle leave. Becoming ill could death sentence them. probably LOT easier work CDC convey real guidelines, president willing listen work them. really see logic behind people work working less august november. Maybe tourist country 45c might end work sooner hot pick berries make roofs whatever pretty much year round normal work. organization serious credability medical community. worried comes Covid. long term implications? result, worth note Chinese system constant reform, probably political system changed among peers past decades (Deng XiaoPing market reform 80', Jiang opening party 90', etc.). point treating like China Mao, dictatorship ruled family like Kim dynasty North Korea.

Because political long explanation posts removed sub basis ""purely political"" (which fair), I'll end thought reflects present day coronavirus situation:

The Chinese system way *accountable* American democratic system. way singly party state shift blame opposition. fix whatever difficulty happens choice keep legitimacy intact. contrast, I'd argue democratic systems allow elected official pretty much whatever want elected, ""threat"" reelected years, literally even matter leader time took deliberate disastrous action, completely mismanaged critical situation, foreign policy domestically handling deadly pandemic resulting hundreds thousand death.

Moreover, competency, coronavirus task force handled crisis China. [Dr. Zhong ran show called shots, TV XI Jinping criticized Western media present, basically job let expert early January 2020, Zhong visited Wuhan, response growing cluster then-unidentified pneumonia cases, reassured city health officials disease controllable preventable. January 20, however, returned Wuhan, re-evaluate situation, came conclusion novel coronavirus transmissible previously identified, warned Central Committee Chinese Communist Party[10] authorities Wuhan likely understating severity outbreak, day, publicly announced state television same.

This specifically characteristic Chinese system per se, many democracies less let task force direct action, technocrat side Chinese leaders (f.e. Xi JingPing engineering degree) respect science certainly strong influence.

Overall, democratic vs authoritarian system clear cut might initially believe, certainly acknowledge can't talk freely overthrowing CPC China, criticizing policies possible, protesting possible (see article above), better, Chinese freedom sense get government act better practical way.

I argue Chinese system perfect rose tainted (China faces enormous challenges), I'm look data past results policies, depending definition ""freedom"" personally might prefer Chinese system American one, certainly prefer freedom living life 

Lastly, research opinion HK XinJiang, want dive topics since politically heavy clearly line coronavirus sub. Hopefully acceptable get removed. Curious. would argue exactly?

Not Chinese, China pet peeve years dived basically works average Westerner.

I exactly say China ""free"" liberal sense term, would certainly argue system much ""reactive"" need citizens.

To make short, like two sentences quite reflects reality imho:

* *""In China, government controls corporations, US corporations control government.""*

* *""You can't change party China, change policies. change party US, can't change policies"".*

To support first point, election guarantee policies widely reflects wishes people. See f.e. [this study Princeton University Multivariate analysis indicates economic elites organized groups representing business interests substantial independent impacts U.S. government policy, average citizens mass-based interest groups little independent influence

Which basically means US democracy little illusion, theory system reflects ""one man, one vote"" principle polls, practice Jeff Bezos vote (of different kind paper outside poll) weights much one average American.

For second point, one need realize Chinese choose leaders directly, China [has local level, different mechanism select competent officials higher levels, pretty much based results performance, rather voting charismatic leader.

Not direct elections upper levels also mean legitimacy (elections equaling legitimacy Western amalgamation), mean channel place voice needs, notably form public opinion surveys. academic longer article topic, excellent writing: [The ""Surprise"" Authoritarian Resilience Wenfang Tang (2018).

That one article particularly interesting since goes deeper public survey system, demonstrates reasons Chinese people actually support government mass (higher democracies), various Western explanations high approval (such ""Chinese live unfree society extremely low expectations government them"") actually unfounded, judgment Chinese system West certainly ideologically biased. (As side bonus, reading might learn interesting things Tiananmen event might defy original understanding). electorate mainly. That's PiS them. already warned parents watch 1st November i'll advise stay home Christmas. Becoming ill way risky Kids age 10. Kids age 10-18 much stronger vectors spreading disease, pretty evident since outbreaks schools U.S. internationally high schools. one size fits solution. Might get people listen, might get fired. understanding intro/extroversion go mentally recharge - alone, people? relaxes long day? Introverts like parties. People seem confuse “hermit” years now, there's conspiracy talk shadowy world powers seeking implement form ""surplus population reduction.""  
I never believed it.  
Lately though.. contact tracing + isolation + universal mask wearing, guess. drew line 6 months. I'm happy sit parties parades, socially distance wear masks, I'm away 3 best friends long. friend group lost third people year everyone stressed, I'm done letting government take youth away heard rumors test covid isen't adequate actually tell person covid not.
Does anyone source ? Madrid according smells official government line let states handle it. Yeah problem long haul flights people sugar imbalances call Greenland dumb, ever blasé attitude potential millions deaths he's alluding simply beyond ability understand... us are. Fair point. Someone works public health NI told couple weeks ago cases rocketing. blanket statement step beyond whole truth. wonder see huge corporations donating subsidizing supply chain logistics this. Saw NFL donating planes PPE beginning, needed would owners donate millions help community? stake getting whole bunch people back stadiums fast possible. They've call ups downs statistics viruses pandemics waves many decades. 

Ever since I've read Spanish flu remember referred come waves.

It's new idea means there's dip spike statistics. scientific definition based stage viruses something like that. reference genetic stability emergence new strain. virus need mutate second wave.

Sooo... really opinion simply way reference type data forms kind significantly oscillating pattern.

Like could look temperature data see wave that's really concept waves actually ever meant. exactly using referencing virus especially new one Data still coming in, less opinion terminology. friend got covid United flight Actually based real person. Google Rod Ansell. 🤟

also, masks fucking uncomfortable. i'll wear one, get science. fucking hero's journey ignorant masses - look me, i'm *helping*! Madonna supposed vaccine I’m confident UK established western countries really aren’t badly statistics show us. Indeed. I'm reminded every day. certainly would want progress up. friends gangsta enough would want celebrate, probably pay escort to… Well, escort nightclub go drug/sex bender like week straight. can, I’ve seen couple people comment say done didn’t show antibodies even sure got vaccine. I’m sure commercially available antibody tests super reliable now. One arguments air circulates vertical airplane, horizontal, never go much beyond individual passenger. think chemicals come from? Nature, baby! want go brothels. go runs 1am park without fear

Crime happen China? Imagine believing statistics released communist state. many days landing wait get tested? No, painfully obvious that. Covid made painfully obvious countries cutting budgets comes healthcare basically throwing dice people's lives. Ostensibly that's sanitize store doubt that's happening anymore. 

I miss 24 hour stores. yeah, way less safe everyone condensed smaller block CPS: ""Why teachers want play Russian Roulette? pay enough wallow viral mire?"" you’re dick ❤️ Impossible Boeing said it’s almost possible get covid airplane. People get tired restrictions. takes certain type person still find pleasure vigilant months holding hope tbh turns true fantastic. Hahaha almost like we've trickle truthed since April prevent panic!

Masks unnecessary! Covid spread children! Covid airborne! Covid kill young!

It's almost like entire population manipulated control panic. almost like US government label something like airborne fake news - mods Reddit remove posts.

Not calling mods here, April sudden media went puppies rainbows overdrive, pretty much guided claims 'that admin'.

It aint conspiracy remember happening. need modify internet, it'll like spend 8 months pretending covid touch hazard! not, article say schools primary driver infection. says schools particularly ages 0-10 community transmission low (below 5%). high school students, that's necessarily true statement, especially schools areas higher levels community transmission (greater 10%).

The comprehensive study done far shows clear opposite trying point first wave perfect practice second wave, but... Good thing president tough polluters rolled back environmental protections gutted epa... Everyone hyperbole (I pro masks example I'm minority) true different type antimasking. much less political people think work. trust Tegnell says there's scientific evidence masks' effectiveness caveats mention. lot people think Sweden country world following science that's we're also one countries without mask mandates. Last weeks I've seen trend shift Twitter among friends still hear ""couldn't imagine wearing mask"" there's least amount ""my freedom!"" again, much less political US. family would like see part 0.4% survive it? family would ""acceptable loss"" pursuit current government's goal ""herd immunity""/""herd mentality""/""survival fittest""?

Because millions people exposed already led nearly quarter million deaths US.

How's bloody ""99.6% survival rate"" really sounding now?

Questions like reason people world asking-

America, fuck happened you?  mean equal immunity antibodies high? Christ uninformed opinion Man depressing read. already know wear mask. 😏  Yo used excited award 💀 3800 far climbing science says child humans can’t spread infectious diseases? Meanwhile, rich people hang private pool laugh think peasants covered shit natural state, anything stop it? Literally killing Americans. Ya true. Like honestly. Think Ron Jeremy coming windshield you. Fuck that. Yeah, seems people want simplify it. can’t get head around it. It’s around 10 E Asia counties seem less immune virus. west go, worse spread deaths seem be. 

I’ll guess even scientific community knows yet is. 

But I’m sure it’s masks. one turn us British? Thanks sharing! started wearing one work people started to. it’s like sixty percent shit talkers mostly shut up. turd mentality county too...bet close!! It’s crazy. I’ve trying stay away Ohio (I’m
Originally North Carolina) come back yesterday. don’t even go store anymore. Fucking knew Names, hand Cancel Culture far left turns too! Lifestyle choices Czechia: rookie numbers. husband bet going close school again. surprised happens week. Corrected 78% antibodies factor becoming reinfected quite often generally means tougher time fighting infection. also probably concerned one fight second time, think immune might next wave super spreaders. think looking something killed hindered thousands people abundance caution probably good thing. worried much stop spread this? Yep, mask usage near 100% part Ireland bars restaurants closed month still ended back lockdown week would joke?? fascist need stopped Ah thank you. know define ""asymptomatic""? epidemiologist sure. But, least interpolating patterns observed across Europe US. Primarily, winter going key reason spread. Luckily, Canada huge population low takes time show numbers. sad part people realize problem occurs. Cities like Toronto Vancouver gear soon. Definitely even harder second time round people enough can’t see financial support getting handed businesses another extended period time forced close again. Think Europe US holding onto hope vaccine starts getting administered end year....and fairly highly effective ! 

Zero cases unrealistic lockdown UK originally set 3 weeks went months make proper difference case rates reasonably effective lockdown would need happen amount time again... pretty well end July, really started spread seem averaging 80 cases day last weeks (down 200 day still good all). population 1.4 million, means there's significant community spread, especially almost Oahu, population geographically spread along shore lengthways main transport routes, make even easier contain populations one big metropolitan blob. Yet, they've five times deaths area Australia. seems like able effectively 2020. u recommend 22-24 hour flights (essential travel course)? Nature's way underscoring, hollering out:

Currently area we've shortage nurses years, always shortage. “demonstrates potential spread SARS-COV-2 linked air travel.” Well, yes, lot flights make spread events.  idiot flight attendant made remove p100 face shield let cover exhaust vent fabric second cellulose mask. decided already air.

Don't fly avoid it... never know encounter moron power. screwed much Trump, would've died months ago hope so!!! 🌹🌹 comprehensive studies like one Korea actually demonstrated children drive virus, particularly older children 10-18. Super helpful, thank posting! thus affect chances vaccine working? always thought Kevin. Sounds closest Karen. Assuming in-person education automatically qualifies education ""quality"" erroneous.

In guess Denmark expecting attack sea, invading Copenhagen something? school shut 12 days (31okt-11 nov). think slow spread maybe even get exponential shrinking (R&lt;1) Biden say part he/his legal team thinks would violate. suspect federal vs state authority that's guess.

Sure, *one* student losing year might easy remedy, one *classroom*? one *school*? one *school district*? think Mossad intelligence agencies idea vaccine trial progressing.

It's kind big deal terms geopolitics. Relevant two missed life lived [...], family gatherings hugs threat. Need update firmware yearly new 5G capabilities.

(It's sad add but) : /s Thanks info! Good stuff Hey look, study says assholes assholes. I’d like apply grant study wetness water. thousands people god killed make Americans vote Joe Biden? Solid logic, Jane. water wet. 15k cases day still take year. think politicians allow exponential growth much longer. Tonight Flanders discuss new restrictions. 


R value Brussels close 1 moment. CEO Drägerwerke called back March. said something like ventilators company makes would also need well trained people operate them. Never heard that, food lovely. going shitty little pubs Birmingham would explain people think bad bad 40% population care. agree, sadly States it’s mess doubt they’ll last open much longer here. bears repeating: party personal responsibility preaches personal responsibility people absolutely personal responsibility. countries allowed serve 14-day stay-home notice place residence Singapore instead dedicated facility Nov 4. countries Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand Turkey, said Ministry Health (MOH) news release Tuesday (Oct 27).

Because citizens countries (US) can't trusted stay published rate excess deaths, USA would like *half million* excess deaths. Bc 7 months know moment right? Except, that's really case. Chicago might continuing go online, maybe district 10 miles away going hybrid, district 50 miles away going in-person. vaccine restrictive storage requirements? kept extremely cold storage? massive risks women’s health safety outlawed abortion? 

Also, anyone recommendations help outside Poland- please share! do!  Maybe so, Trump come enthusiastically masks back April, supporters would followed him. situation high levels tribalism, people take cues leader tribe. Ahhh that's argument? pointed futility destroying society prevent 90 years old dying called murderous grandma haters.

It visibly clear people dying anything covid matter could? 🤔 think problem much personality, wrong message send beginning. got initial ""don't wear mask"" message generally ""masks protecting others"", little focus mask tool personal protection.

If care others, that's reason keep distance mask up. That's unreal. would expect leader ISIS say that…but scientists? mean understand doubt towards lawyers pharmaceutical companies, defense industrial complex, scientists general? I’m speaking strictly United States, hasn’t able contain virus decided open schools without much plan PPE funding, led outbreaks. heard countries able reopen schools without problems, post referring US, anywhere else. I’ll edit comment there’s confusion one village 6k/100k currently infected. Butchenbach 339cases /5629 pop Tbh getting mass downvoted saying reinfection still huge issue yet saying could close normal spring saying long term effects probably much rarer think learn flu cure really perplexing certainly try justify detention migrants ICE camps. bad, no? infuriates many people way arbitrarily pick choose ""experts"" count based whether fits agenda not. information article is... incredibly weird cherry picky looking. Kind suspicious. lot sources mentioned always vaguely seems like great deal crippling errors including limited to: citing anecdotal evidence references, citing studies concluded less month schools areas reopened obviously enough time major outbreaks, citing studies reopenings Asian countries 1000s times less cases places like US really comparable... Fake news. people getting infected?

From US: Los Angeles County Health Department able trace 65 70% positive cases. those, majority, 55%, gathering/events (unknown indoor / outdoor). second place, 17%, places worship. 6% childcare, 4% schools, 3% colleges, considering education mostly online LA, tiny number. Another 15% unspecified. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=2760


Note: describe people think got infected, nessecarily really got infected. Still, seems like schools still significant sources infection according numbers. Ok, never used shitty sub. believe it’s 65% protection wearer. insignificant.


Only n95 masks, dont re-use, dont touch it.

Most people dont use masks correctly. may well even one on. require least one involved parent though make work.

...which available *every* special needs student, unfortunately. 2020. Current leadership gone herd ~~immunity~~ mentality route empathy.

FTFY ;) Also, OP said: VOTE! hole study waste resources, could told free I'm aware, also many new members arround time. guess sucks admins force new mods beloved hate sub. still alive mean serious complications high school teacher, give shit students age ten responsible enough schoolwork without Mommy Daddy looking shoulder.

What kids younger ten? last time, antibodies aren’t way get immunity Oof different? new studies demonstrate severity disease predictive longer-lasting antibody production detail immunity wanes time may exist 7 months. Japan population willing mask distance...... Local laws vs federal laws. never intelligent person. straw man here. United think implications words. Whatever. spreads effectively that's sure. How? simple words, people dont want wear mask assh*les

Nobody *wants* wear masks, they? lots people think it. better this. first point really valid, along points made thread, really highlights problems country, schools. push expand internet access citizens? push increase food security? work reducing domestic abuse rates? 

Why people worked reducing funding dismantling public schools extolling role schools solving societal problems? convenient scapegoat avoid confront problems themselves. 

As high school teacher, give shit students age ten responsible enough schoolwork without Mommy Daddy looking shoulder. sink swim real world, sometimes kids need learn sinking feels like relatively consequence free environment like middle/high school become adults, sinking means roof head food table. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* military big move lots stuff around world probably really smart people think would feel better Amazon someone chiming best practices. many young children testing? Yeah live NYC, fucking clue holding back months now. people wearing masks though smart. teacher 2 students test positive. truly proved wrong. what's plan then? Herd immunity? See survives it? 

No lives destroyed, probably bunch fines, many lives saved.

The economy fucked either way.

Na, we'll right mate  trust them, something fast tracked without fully knowing side effects think it’s safe? Olympus take makes sterile? blind? Ido trust vaccines want know it’s safe mainline stupid fucking thing think safe open schools. many people make bad decisions effects people sending kids school making good decisions. ""They"" say covid mutates slowly enough *won't* like flu mutates fast enough need new vaccines time. THANK YOU. Maybe people stop reading much antibody study contained info already knew. immunity lasted couple months would’ve seen shit ton re-infections, haven’t.

This key people seem glossing over. first month epidemic right now. We're like, month 8-10. immunity lasted couple months, number people infected, we'd seeing HUGE number re-infected. Right one two possible examples, says immunity definitely happens least 8 months. people actually got tested. Kids usually get tested unless symptoms, often asymptomatic. wonder % cases parents getting sick asymptomatic child brought back school playtime. Maybe that's ""unknown"" percentage.

The mayor Atlanta husband got sick way, 2 children asymptomatic.

Many people go hospital doctor Covid doctors tell assume everyone family household it, quarantine everyone. often test whole family kids, quarantine never show case count. Yep years folks keep bullshitting around like this..making political game instead needs done washable fabric masks people wear really protect them, function spit guards, ""protecting others""... partially. least, virus used scapegoat Global Reset. Well definitely engaged social, pleasant honest way. 

You're also kind proving point type propaganda changes interact people different opinion No, also sub dead 6+ months banned. strawman bullshit alongside personal attacks time, great day. logical. Occam's razor seems imply well. flight recycling air often American airlines (i.e every 4-5 minutes?). see anything article I've always used upvote button way promote awareness post instead agree disagree button.

If people see this, upvote.

If nonsense egregiously bad people would better died new, downvote. What's wrong you? hard comprehend many thousands people protesting countrywide, must valid reason it?

Didn't pay attention history class, people always fighting freedom?

Stop acting Covid apocalypse. issued executive order makes easier fire federal employees poor performance. currently take YEAR fire non-performant tax-paid employeee, dumb. opinion piece, share author's opinion.

Politicians gain support selling messages least people want buy.

Narcissism become part American mainstream politics message appeals people.  want self-centered embrace give permission way. China runs phase 1 2 China, trials mainly concerned safety. fact believe there's new influenza-based vector vaccine trial right China. can't run phase 3 China cases COVID-19 China determine effective candidate preventing infection.

Those trials public, application forms weibo everything. Back Ad5-nCoV phase 1 trial running (the first one enter phase 1 China) volunteers would even vlogs inside quarantine describe they're feeling what's lunch on.

I even linked application form one inactivated virus vaccine trials subreddit first became available. say Italians real personal appraisal cost benefits whole situation give reaction thought. getting voted ""facts"" poorly understood comments read internet. obviously background molecular biology cube across alarmist simply wants scare people. I'm judging, I'm pointing people like post. date today Hopefully. needed weekly proposition acceptable

Men Black good movie “collective response” mean restrictions lockdowns yes. Here's latest case/death charts Michigan, running 7-day currently ranks 11th per capita true. bit complicated that. 
First, Lombardy evenly hit. particular 3 provinces Milan one those.
Also, people angry already make big sacrifices. New guidelines came week week reopen stay open safely businesses expenses. Gyms, pools, bars linked many transmission cases. Places safe rules strict. everything fine schools reopened public transports started packed again. much, say nothing, done reopen schools safely transportation plan. government 6 months get ready. Now, populist government using “schools right card” solved problem pandemic coherent closing everything else. yes, school right, it’s right, cannot pecking order sake argument only. businesses see sacrificed altar incompetence.
Nothing done keep vulnerable protected either. There’s surge cases nursing homes within families young children. 

The government promoting restrictions without disclosing scientific rational public. Italian government clear plan thought one past six months. restrict lockdown want, mandate masks hand sanitizers. That’s enough stop pandemic there’s plan, makes go boom bust cycles rather flatter curve.

So can’t really fault people Lumbardy, Italy many countries sitting without demanding clear answers clear plan. edited post. Basically, yes. That's hypothesis well.

Though say people unfortunately started relaxing social distancing recently, curve shows that. Combine internet get ww3  Significant? even parliament Sometimes good know phase, spike, wave, started. Since would allow figure happened make sure happen again, covid well future diseases.

But government care first placd makes much sense they’ll multi-tiered system that’s different towns within city’s makes sense like UK. clearly way we’re going here. Reckon would take solid 6 months military grade lockdown get cases lots places Europe it’s hand !  retarded? dumb rock buy low effort, pseudo-scientific propaganda like this.

Masks either supporting evidence don't. Bullshit psychological assertions change either way. Republicans: \*waves hand\* Covid. law analogies good disorder? NPD, ODD, BPD, Psychopathy, Sociopathy? Really puts new perspective ""we number 1"" No. USA averages 30k-60k flu deaths per year. That's 0.009-0.017% population. national freedom? three territories (internal)... would dream. work sectors abandoned without help, people yet received money government gave March. People tired. live near Naples revolt, whole Italy danger dying hunger instead Covid. government months first second wave, one anything. places hospitalization intensive care increased slightly, many structures built never tested lack doctors, nurses anesthetists. Activities catering, also taxi drivers many others, spent money buy masks, plexiglass panels make premises compliant spacing etc. result? government makes close first. Italy tired government continues give damn poor people end worst way known cunt ? Hmm interesting. think then?

 people practice social distancing Sweden? Wow, came surprise would assumed Hawaii would remain pretty safe. Apparently 14k total cases. comparison's sake Australia 27k total. Hawaii??? Camping &amp; grounding 12 million population is, fact, extremely costly &amp; annoy. 

Consider infrastructure(wall &amp; building), supervision, manpower cost, plus everyday supply cost managing system, literarily cost-effectiveness.  

You would say ""The forced labors"". 12million people without selected market, different education levels, including kids elders, cut normal connection outside(also means part consumer market - needs leads produce, ECO 101 ). kind ""concentration camp + force labor"" things really dubious pour thinking it. Sounds like I’m anyway fair, work - run -sleep -repeat. Unfortunately everyone else UK decided give up. Would probably take 6 months solid lockdown get cases zero now. ever even real lockdown begin ! Don’t even know people going out, new rules it’s same, bored home honestly better going 🤷‍♂️ rDNA-based vaccine easier get across ""it's conspiracy alter human DNA"" crowd :) 

Bold assume crowd make shit Don’t forget people could stay shit wanted buy decided swimming important them. forced take vaccine gun point differentiate spike wave? almost zero new infections Ireland months ago we're around 1k per day Actually saw article layers mask better sure pf credibility. T-cells one example.

The body different types memory cells allow rapid identification payhogen rapid production antibodies case re-infection. ex gf borderline personality disorder bitched time...so anecdotally....yes scary. voted dropping ballot. mask mandate still dont feel comfortable going line. cases still rising Canada? thought masks mandatory there?

Well, masks end avoiding COVID-19. Despite people believe.

Here Sweden need actively search find anybody mask. Yet still new cases late summer recently.

Mask usage (or lack it) drives pandemic. Exactly. Hence mentioning mom internet Disrespecting sociopaths. government just... loosened quarantine rules contact someone infected people house might infected free roam about. :/ rules fucked - quarantine 10 days infected someone house likely would sti infectious quarantine ends. symptoms 10 days quarantine also free go. Honest question. Canada expect see rise second wave like France rest Europe? 60% time Fauci right every time. speaking personally, obviously doesn’t kill everyone, us certain health conditions... well, it’s risk I’m going take.  case Covid, seems inflammation problem mostly, sometimes antibodies matching attacking body tissue.

Also, Covid fast replicating, 0 max. viral load one two days. Yeah bro, flu, go party friends, please. wear mask, ok? One meat missile kill people most, one spreader could responsible many dead. Yeah know im Swedish :)

I tried doublecheck numbers ended similar (but different) result. seen discussed somewhere reddit?

I assume lots people already wrote them, including media. dont think nice write aswell. Usa FUNNY US election drop almost 97% Flu cases last season. incredible. Unless indication surge Belgium driven significant amount reinfections, think holds. people Belgium infected first wave one conducive places world fast spread wide variety reasons, uncontrolled going dwarf buffer people catch first time around. half deaths per capita New York, population still potentially vulnerable. Look cold chain logistics, answer. informations from, esp. part ""And coronaviruses use trick raising long-term immunity "". death rate actually 2% virus force nature, like flu.

As American, tell you, entire world's wealth resources, managed stop flu; sitting demanding China able stop brand new virus one ever seen even knew about.

That's really quite unreasonable unrealistic.

Well, stop it. took months it. extrapolated point. Nice diversion tactic. honest, really care *why* people right thing, long do. undeniable downsides conformity, tends get things done, often pretty straightforward: flat told do, social pressure takes care fact also do.

In general, think good governance needs two things:

* good rulers figure done
* population they're told do.

Around here, power divided held bureaucrats economic interests, difficult control public opinion decide factors importance. Facts often used political fodder, control potential voters consumers, thus twisted turned truth obscured. People lock homes volition - fear - happens. They're wave pool think! agree two strategies, suppression control. first put place strong lockdown first (until test tracking system catches everyone) putting ban international movements (or quarantining everyone), ban lifted end pandemic. second would mean putting place measures strictly necessary prevent hospitals overrun, easing reinforcing according epidemiological situation. Poorly timed confidence, Denver Colorado problem, we're seeing globally europe getting hit hard right now, everybody seems forgotten there's global pandemic second critical point containing it. find interesting media always puts photo whitest kids Whatever wave U.S. in, looks like situation pretty critical juncture. Hospitalizations cases per day moving past previous peaks earlier year, question much higher go. virus sort hard-limit quickly spread now, blow past previous peaks make real catastrophe? I’m sure we’re gonna find out. 

And here’s one thing suspect true goes lot conventional wisdom. It’s suggested asymptomatic cases huge portion, meaning lot population exposed numbers show, think asymptomatic spreaders actually common. isn’t say aren’t virus’s trump card. are. make almost impossible contain, aren’t many feel assured we’re ways along think scary real-world sign immunity doesnt last Belgium (second reported deaths Peru) example one worst hit countries spring. cases though roof again.

Why? high estimate number infections spring UK 1/8 population. leaves 7/8 population vulnerable even high end. far 3% population tested positive, even allow under-testing, nothing argues form immunity time based numbers alone.

Sure, possible, numbers neither help hinder argument long-term immunity. like fingerminigun. Antrim Area hospital already overloaded NI currently covid patients hospital peak April. Plenty regional variation within UK. ""Statistikmyndigheten"" could translated something like usa.gov/statistics. Like thing country like website keeping track everything country domestic abuse unemployment. feel free write press officers article clarification names, phone number, e-mails attached. people protest abortion ban government issued suddenly. wear masks expect much spread protests - goverment anti-covid people blame everything them. sooner later US covid gonna adopt apple marketing strategy.

Wave 1.9S extra long.  high, low? Lower US Europe? there’s effective vaccine that’s matters it. crazies like UBI. perfect. rescue boat, life raft country sinking fast. Yea hate pissy I'm sure well intentioned post ignorant Victoria going through. friends coworkers states say thing person replied go (can see poster's history well). literally idea like experience four months lockdown ability go out. mean even high risk individual go drive rural area back without ever interacting another human can't Melbourne. lot examples difference.

I'm even sure posted experience given completely irrelevant happened Victoria (in particular Metro Melb). matter first, second, third 55th wave? stupid semantics scientific consequences know Bill evil /s general is. I've worked least two companies mentioned absolutely experience like that. buy honest, companies magnitude single culture leadership style, amalgamation different departments, heads, leaders cultures. 

Look Ford example - way work North America far different Europe. 

Maybe exposure narrow stream company, North America. N95+surgical mask

how wear together? surgical mask n95 ? - Melbourne Metro. relieved strict lockdown paid off. best friend Sunday night! yeah, i'm ready take this... True. though since example counted 100 000 times amount reinfections also mention fact hadnt counted hidden first time cases. legal drinking age dad wanted cut seatbelts car decided cause would hurt resale value. im trying cope dude  Also could tell governors order mandate. mean Trump told seems doing. kiwi, fucking terrifying.

We've 0andemic going almost 12 months now. still first wave??

What ever loving fuck America. Get together lack trying though (except maybe Brazil Mexico early on). Colombia one longest lockdowns world (over 5 months) even then, we're still top 10 numbers cases absolutely wrecked economy. Argentina similar situation. impossible maintain strict lockdown large percentage population lives day day earnings; work day, family eat day.

Doing everything right containing pandemic privilege rich nations. IMO, anti maskers maladaptive defense mechanisms demonstrate poor emotion regulation. clearly intellectualize emotional reactions public health recommendations oppositional act feelings animosity. Also, think folks look feelings superiority feeling special others affinity oppositional beliefs. It’s critical thinking, it’s merely oppositional justify actions. Given people celebrating Halloween Poland minority, doubt it'll create much damage. Still, would better stay home. many uses, medical mask glove disinfected washed ?

Also, exact duration/ no. uses masks gloves discarded ? take account lot 43 million cases reality.

It shouldn't, either: accept genetic sequencing gold standard realistic cases. needs confirmed reinfection cases sensible numerator denominator. Things certainly changed simce days Daschle McGovern Extremely interesting. statistics doublechecked, know? Maybe discussed somewhere else, understand allowed discussed separate post blog

I searced Google doesnt seem like anyone debunked numbers. maybe explanation else like mention. shame healthcare environment toxic. lot good nurses end leaving, even normal times. goes show fucked america general dont know still first third wave. general, case Covid? gets even complex that. Europe ""get China"". 

Their businessmen went Wuhan, contracted became super spreaders Europe. Specifically one Europe's largest outbreaks Italy, traced back German businessman.

So ""get China"" much ""They took China spread it"".

Most China's spread confined Wuhan neighboring regions, most, rest Asia.

The Europeans spread virus Europe, Americans Europeans flying back America Europe spread America. share strain. misreading it, saying 95% infected European strain. help hardcore ""nay sayers"" but, please kill hope, there's huge crowd simply know there's several different vectors vaccine tackle virus (weakened live virus, broken pieces shell, potentially rDNA kind thing, ...) hops onto DNA-altering train people shouting loud enough.

Just weeks ago I've chat someone who's riding Gates-is-Evil-train knowing much; time advocating use Windows office computers (which part said ""Gates Evil"" twenty years ago, even Microsoft started contributing Linux' kernel get rid dependence Windows ;)) death rate took place spring, neither Norway, Finland Denmark mask mandates either. 

The thing is, Swedes personally anti-maskers. listen (often blindly) authorities, long authorities mandating them, they're worthless. soon authorities saying use public transport, expect high compliance. 

So, ironically, non-use masks Sweden attributable thing American anti-maskers claim hate. Meanwhile America . . . mostly culture fear death concept family community bigger family Chinese cultures related/derived Chinese (Korean, Japanese, Singapore, TW etc, even Vietnam). Obviously political system goes values life much compared ""Freedom"" goes first parts. Yes time *definitely* kill status, vs., serious condition avoided virtually cost due potential severe symptoms lasting complications, life expectancy going pretty damn short matter what. say so. Check NY Times article yourself. 

Another study August 2 main points question:
- infections wider community likely driving cases schools
- children likely acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection home school

So, study found schools safer many alternatives students teachers.

At school, incidents pod quarantining required happened first 2-weeks everyone school. gotten school session brought (mostly teachers staff). everyone back school routine, chances teacher student contracting dropped substantially spending majority time “safe zone” school. 

This certainly personally predicted (I thought we’d converted virtual 1 week), past 3-months 100% proven wrong. feel bad lot friends colleagues schools still locked down. It’s back normal means, schools going back really heathy kids, families, community. 

The virus weird works! think we’ll studying LONG time trying figure out. 

Link study bullet points Sorry referencing last two countries. Oz NZ. collected, blinded though. Still need analyzed, grouped, compared, etc. Reviewed analyzed.

And talking publishing, talking submitting findings (how long takes get data actually preparing document submit). 

But free believe happen day hit 32. happy wrong, nobody rooting delaying vaccine here. Yes, check social media potential new hire.

If find anti-mask content, figure reason hire them. feel least bit bad it. want nothing kind person, refuse let someone like infect (pun intended) org.

Sorry sorry. True... Taiwan is. Vietnam South Korea not. Though South Korea border North Korea, anyone gonna go border without getting shot first, vaccine got shot at. still 65-70% last Tuesday's 3180 cases. Deaths 300% last week's 4 deaths 16. may backlog large increase.

Last week's update: that’s bad look people downvoting lol Bu bu bu flying safe industry sponsored report said so.

My dad thirty+ year veteran aviation military commercial sectors. wouldn’t get plane fact waiting UAE vaccine available safely fly back. It’s safe. Singapore pleasure experience Makes sense Make mask better, shit own. Sweden relatively ok increased cases low deaths

It goes like every outbreak since beginning epidemic. People always comment low deaths cases rise, two three weeks later deaths come surprised. 5191 confirmed cases means least 51 deaths coming. :( Nice personal attack.

The first study linked non-school environment. course younger kids gonna high rate household transmission. parents hug make dinner even they're sick make bed go laundry everything. household positivity rate higher 20-30 year old assume independent rely parents, therefore less interactions roommates. starts climb people get older contact spouses/kids. really shocked. one outbreak Israel really relevant. said (or whoever made original claim) outbreak US tied schools opening said there's evidence that. linked non school Korean study Israeli outbreak. None shows outbreak US caused schools. alma mater Notre Dame reopened small outbreak 200 students people adjusted new rules. fte week two figured out. 1 day even. I'm saying open schools rules. Plenty schools Illinois opened up. positive cases shut proactively till cases clear opened back up. 1 2 cases traced correctly fine. niece went home cold school let back negative test. New Trier, one high school Illinois, 7 active cases 42 students quarentining 3980 students. students Illinois died since opening August. fact, 7 people age 20 died entire state since start pandemic. list preexisting conditions, I'm sure 7 serious health issues. Nobody advocating types kids go back school right now. teachers risk. students whose parents risk. Yeah hard zero morning. balls definitely frozen asked getting downvoted. told you. randomly told smile stranger months. glorious! always wear surgical mask N95. available, wear cloth one it. protects well. **Questions press conference:**

*The number IVA cases increasing, rapid development?*

\- No, really started low levels. hope measures taking conscious increase means end situation again, says Anders Tegnell.

*Due current situation Europe Sweden, Stockholm Medical Association says time back away relief made restrictions people age 70, say that?*

\- continuously monitor efforts Sweden try adapt well possible. Right working adapting locally spread infection looks different country. comes people age 70, slightly different situation, large increase among moment. important help protect them, see reason change part today, says Anders Tegnell.

*Why introduce discouragement domestic travel situation looks different country?*

\- discussion having. far, differences great, many regions increase. think important General advice avoid many contacts. fact, also quite clear advice traveling almost always means new contacts people, says Anders Tegnell. right, level compliance see every day horrid. travel around Denver work see first hand. Meanwhile Finland

Cases:
14,970
Deaths:
354 varying rules masks. I’m sure much enforced. sounds like ensure teachers high pay don’t need put danger. Sounds good me. sounds like don’t like strong unions. Okay that’s definitely tone misinterpreted it. It’s like saying “can win game” rooting favorite sports team. know hard understand, *perhaps* person different you, health condition puts higher risk. Crazy, right. would really impressive Israel able deduce (with vaccines short time) sinovac vaccine would work. /s opa (grandfather) remarried 2nd wife British. always trashed British cooking said reason use many condiments, flavour added cooking lol. idea true is, great cook herself. 

My brief visit England involve fancy restaurant, mostly delicious pub-fare pretty tasty (meat pie one night, 2nd night Yorkshire pudding, roast veggies). really enjoy English breakfast tea though.  Anti-nicotine replacement therapy thing? data collected go. blinding simply know vaccine placebo. Boulware said, data could reviewed quickly.

Also note Pfizer released Phase I/II data right starting Phase III, release full analysis Phase III started. Publishing findings prerequisite DSMB. almost certainly one FDA, again, even plan applying EUA end next month. trump inside landslide? would think enlightened self interest would help assholes wear mask due social distancing, nay people what's far worse around them. perfect analogy many reasons. give us straight plan it. 

I imagine yelling “You can’t handle TRUTH” backstage getting podium. know I'm undervaluing mental health? know me, pre-existing conditions might have, demands placed me, anything else. you’re allowed say assholes reddit!

**ASSHOLES!** comparison ""security theater"" TSA good one. Another article makes comparison security theater hygiene theater posted almost hourly, months. Let’s ignore fact bombed poor people color 8 years. started terms war 3 countries, war 8 countries left office. 25,000 bombs dropped 2015 alone. Never punished banks 2008 crisis put legislation place stop happening again. Didn’t back protestors pipelines, even police tearing shreds. Kept kids cages long trump did, deported trump did. 

It’s crazy many people follow cult leader way speaks... don’t focus actions individual. left right lot common way. doomed Dumbass here. case count yesterday +40%, +38% day before.

Oh, yesterdays case count CA 4,355 according official statistics.

You ramp another wave. know tens thousands (hundreds thousands?) already already asymptomatic mild symptoms never tested, get again? hear people talking ""Republican"" are. literally think A: somehow makes tough B: one l truth *feel*. 

They're worst. Ahh yes, good thing 65+ people actually people right?

I love argument ""Well effect personally, care?""

If 35, skip it! Maybe asymptomatically transmit 65+ person suffer/die instead! health care workers putting bodies refridgeration trucks? Yea cares work Taco bell. problem right? young, low-risk population ongoing symptoms, almost 70% individuals impairment one organs four months initial symptoms SARS-CoV-2 valid source? make seem like they're holding dramatic effect. rush science. wishing people die show God. Two words ""f\*\*king c\*\*t"" Idk, maybe part 220k+ people dead know dug moat. Can't careful. still matters reduce viral load. yeah mostly agreed. understand people's urgency inject COVID cure but, negative (just realistic), chances first batch vaccines going trialed human race regardless ""safe"" tell is. want take chance, hey, one stop you... one stick safety net one CERTAIN proven. coming someone routinely gets vaccinated btw i’ve super curious PIB summer! confirmed cases island? lived worked short time experience can’t imagine single person taking proper covid precautions. well, let alone seeing videos maskless people hugging dancing large groups bars, via friends’ social media. Huh? amazing rose coloured glasses got on...

[The number reported new cases per day rising rate faster ever before... talking swear couple days ago people denying even second wave, plateau? I'm dumbfounded... family there. grandma dies thanksgiving that’s price willing pay. Look man, time, stay safe. argument saying US screwed less nations irrelevant. long countries millions people infected Corona, world never safe. failing America also failings everyone world. rely much America good guys long now, need change that, need diminish need please America time. need realize America unique better everyone else, America like rest countries world stop putting pedestal going forward. Ikr! love people’s response say site nothing. 

So here:[UC Davis study Ikr, also there’s mention cells B cells them, use antibodies source immunity. It’s weird. research insanely mis-interpreted. goal study scientifically compare efficacy various protective measures. goal demonstrate low-cost experimental approach potentially so. results present efficacy taken grain Again, want note mask tests performed (one speaker masks four speakers selected masks) serve demonstration. Intersubject variations expected, example, differences physiology, mask fit, head position, speech pattern, such. sell great KN95s Costco online. bought many boxes family. would maybe look America closer saying that. still disproportionate number deaths we're breaking case records daily despite many people bothering refusing test. 

Pointing sinking ship already underwater great look. Another poster shared below. least part answer. Certainly lot valid ridiculous magical culture stories. lived Japan Vietnam, little Covid also entirely different socially economically. Well eight months, sound like year immunity first wave, second one coming worst.

Hopefully last one, yes, upcoming months pleasure. think starting next spring time start healing rebuilding. We're yet worst come brace endure. Sorry that. felt quite bad, I'm starting realize embrace upcoming winter is. many countries require proof certain vaccinations applying visas travelling there. needed going India. difficult add covid vaccines list. ""It's sort monkey virus. going make people monkeys."" love everybody still focused antibody-mediated protection. Cellular memory (T cells) still highly effective providing long-term protection. Alter dna? Oh man haven’t heard one. Geeze. know I've spent much time reddit thought Asshole   think fact despite population 330 million, quarter world's deaths quite telling US *actually* compared Europe (which two half times people), much less rest world.

Nonetheless, draw comparisons. definitely true US could done **much** better did. lack federal support, politicization virus pandemic countermeasures, rampant spread misinformation, things would never turned bad did. deer ran bushes hit side moving car. parents hit deer also. recently area. Reddit, upvote means ""I think contributes conversation/subreddit.""  mean agree text like hospital workers spend time patients 100% Mormon experience: nurses. Mormon congregations majority worshippers always women mmm...tasty.. Opposite. I'm mask asshole second wave definitely worse. first wave spread dozens people spring. wave spreading hundreds thousands people over, winter, people taking seriously anymore. Well, that's really option right now, I'll something old fashioned work job, buy groceries, occasionally reward drink bar wife. It’s gotten heads 1918 Spanish flu behave exactly like pandemic. it’s flu, it’s worse flu. treat like Spanish flu, far deadly. It’s tiresome confusing people simply ha e stopped caring.

Im ER doc, I'm used patients/staff/the system lots expectations me. Everyone wants get faster, take time them... already take breaks shift, optimally efficient, ultimately time one comes time another. People want confidence narrow mindedness want certainty uncertain imperfect environment. I'm used putting pressures myself, doubt reason multiple shifts row leave feeling burnt out. Patients acknowledge lot help. Patients care enough consider side.

So thank asking.

And course also said getting exposed first place. That’s top lol chill man first wave guess, third surge it. Fauci says never got first wave cases peaked didn’t come much lower baseline, multiple surges cases peak higher fall slowly rather actual waves. wave would require period time cases, haven’t unfortunately. Paywall... 😭 known. 16 deaths quite lot tbh. Sweden relatively ok increased cases low deaths. welcome rabid hyena levels crazy indian media unforgivable unforgettable it’s never entered news feed Something like lol year seems realistic solid. fair, proportion dropped 6% 4.4%, different population samples. always variations randomized tests, also report confidence interval data. usually look different regions, Uppsala Mon-Fri; think Sat-Sun almost one updating numbers anyway (you always see clear drop tests cases weekend days, since tests weekend get backdated actual testing date vs reporting date) truth vast majority people not, cannot know specifically when, where, contracted virus (or virus, matter). fly somewhere, test positive right after, *does mean* caught plane specifically. even caught airport. might caught flew grocery store, develop symptoms get tested after. I’m vaccines “all standard vaccine trials” even close true. understand risk we’re taking accept it, not. 

It’s probably better take vaccine move life. people aren’t going take waiting science comes back aren’t going persuaded science. Define “decent” observe 9-11 fiasco. 

Lives matter US. Property does. physical structure hospitals impacted would response death 230,000+ Americans brings. agree completely, Trump politicized virus point really doesn’t matter. American people don’t care leader hosting super spreader events.... don’t care. It’s disappointing see lack respect virus people president have. wish country cared others well being, case. guess point American people decided group don’t care, what’s point reporting anymore? Germany could've gained ton time properly followed vacationers August closed bars restaurants 2 weeks September. No, economy. Okay good, closing them, maybe something similar lockdown. I'm sure much better economy. Yup. bully family. want bring back virus wife kid sorry leading companies granted protection future product liability claims related COVID-19 vaccine ? required EUA? Denmark better counting though. Yep nails dad head Well yh probably end immediately. would take time vaccine rolled see effective is. I'm sure it'll eventually end immediately moment w vaccine comes mean, look freedom rights. Trails, sexual preference, education, democracy, speech, equality, security, etc.

If compare human rights, trust me, individual would prefer USA Canada Venezuela China. Hahahahahahahah

Better chance COVID actually disappearing Easter. let go area Interesting, imagine leader free world got  fat makes people fat. carbs/sugars. speculation, data yet vaccine efficacies whether provide sterilizing immunity, also u/MoyuSquad known alarmist troll, disregard Ginger giveth, Ginger taketh away. rate, don’t say tiny island nations control virus it’s false ignores country roughly 20% worlds population.

I say that, also guarantee china reporting everything, right wrong first time lied international organizations. even there? start making stupid remarks like know saying. People aren’t admitted hospitals according know, hospitals packed. knew one doctors even doctor kept saying can’t anything. took solid hour half persuading found empty bed someone got permission leave. didn’t stroll automatically got wanted, treated fairly like everyone else. However, knew doctor, obviously wasn’t bothered uncles family constantly asking bed. It’s literally persistence used treated everywhere 

So next time make broad comment accusing Poland whole based literally one sentence, probably think sad see many people can't deal simple (but troubling) situation: bad virus going around, many people die, fewer die take precautions.  need spend many brain cycles looking various bizarre angles. cool! wear mask I'm anti social. I'm gonna let worthless human infect me. back saw Truth commercial look cool popular smoking is, it. Oh no, need security speaking truth power Inaccurate. rural COUNTIES. bulk outbreaks towns cities within ""rural"" counties.  towns cities, outbreaks are, still densely populated, urban areas populations ranging thousands tens thousands residents. That's thing isn't? virus controlled proactive measures, average citizen looks like overreaction. Test trace works best catching new cases numbers low. work system overwhelmed 50k+ cases day.

Local lockdowns tier 0-4 nonsense work even prevent travel throughout different areas. nationally hidden reservoirs virus non-locked areas. Rollbacks maybe. Shutdowns? Absolutely not. even table. wouldn’t worry. Yes, adverse effects even start reach levels toxicity.

Even nothing horrible happens, counterproductive take much. coupled fact masks touted protecting others

I NEVER understood this. clearly lie... think would work?

You can't policies based empathy half America thinks pussies communists. completely agree you, original comment seems imply overall higher number cases. Maybe wording issue. 

Also, side note, say ""infection rate,"" referring positivity rate? Well course, I'm numb basically everything another pandemic dangerous virus. anyone surprised this, haven’t paying attention. yet I'd still vote Conservatives due Christian extremists within midst. huffpost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I really recommend watch following youtube lecture: Ya sure. call names complying? That's literally trait bad guy duh. I'm sure agree assessment. one, fatalities lower young people, mean can't experience long-lasting negative effects virus. importantly, conflated ""rational"" ""self-interested"". Science reason tell ought value, tell achieve value (and reveal ways values may conflict). There's nothing ""irrational"" valuing lives others. Lawful Evil. older get revealed there's lot sociopathic people world. much lead stuff (paint, water, gasoline) back day? always like this? get confusing. Thanks speaking up.   great sign expect EUA request approved, no? could make big difference required masks, massive testing quarantining. specifically said don’t need follow measures.

 I’ve critical China’s harsh, forced measures constant surveillance people name stopping virus. I’m advocating measures.

We make big difference mask mandate testing. people want ignore basic public health measures China used. learn them. 

At rate, don’t say tiny island nations control virus it’s false ignores country roughly 20% worlds population.  count, nine EU countries currently worse US several be. EU whole worse US end day likely.

In terms total deaths, major countries Spain worse, UK, France, Italy gaining ground quickly. major EU country seemingly get keep control Germany. Afraid not. study asks opinions, actions. words, many could following rules, many could not. idea 'not complying' apply questions asking. questions asking whether believe it. asking ""are this"", asking ""do think (insert subject)""

There may study says half everyone wants murder paedophiles, automatically make half society murderers. SD never shut actively avoid masks general. matter time even without rally. parents still live part multiple risk groups (age, weight, etc.) always mask (Biden voters) really go except groceries, I'm fairly worried even so. We're zoom Thanksgiving. import: huuuge number variables differ countries, even using similar methods lockdown. New Zealand Australia received lot praise but, islands, infinitely easier restrict travel continental regions. Countries vastly different public health infrastructure disseminate messaging provide medical care. Even among similar countries, lockdowns varied nations, time, severity enforcement. valid compare ""Lockdown A"" ""Lockdown B"" call day. That’s one reasons avoid it. whelp, already deleted. damn people flouting mask mandates asking ""why even mask mandates community spread"" refuse put two two together.

They're special idiots.

*""Well studied hard got test. I'm getting good grades, clearly study hard. AW FUCK END YEAR C GRADE WTF""* bots stop posting anti-mask messages now?  Again, believe I’ve made clear predictions society’s risk tolerance is. point adopt own. encourage re-read posts say responding them.

100,000 deaths believe within society’s risk tolerance. 

We know 60,000 flu deaths year last decade saw number come fruition nobody batted eye. believe flu upper-bound society’s risk tolerance either.

I suspect 100,000 straddles line, aren’t already.

Without context appreciation aggregate statistics, make number sound prohibitively large. 

For example, say, palpable emotion “one death many!” It’ll sound good.

I also say “650 preventable deaths wear damn mask!” would also sound good.

Point being, society tolerates needless death. every year. Car wrecks, viruses, RX overdoses, alcohol poisoning, etc... Society allows certain number death keeps going.

Right now, Coronavirus allowable amount death. vaccine, point gets allowable amount. Again, suspect 100,000. need define exactly, use statistics extrapolate gets us there.

Masks need go point second later. significant hindrance human experience. mean, yeah, reddit, groupthink prevailing mindset. what? Jokes them, I'm things, wear mask time, even I'm driving alone sitting office. No, aren't. LOL know, I’ve Paris times. something appealing culture cheese wine deeply ingrained. Sure, whatever, fun living life scared. Nothings changed me. Keeping deaths low, well done. isn’t hard make fan filter hose combo battery doesn’t leak that, doesn’t provide enough air (which provides plenty speed 3, even moderate exercising), suck mask draw air filter fan unit. replaced POS kn95 mask came well fitting silicone sealing n95 makes big difference. cut hole mask cut good hole super tight fitting doesn’t leak hose junction. 

There literally downside, it’s like little electric motor pushing bicycle. “What doesn’t make go fast enough run battery?” pedal like caveman like would already didn’t motor. It’s leg work you. fan like that. powered bonus downside, it’s filter 99% filter better 95% n95 pretty significant upside too. 

The filter drawing air similar ones inside pink 3M p100 rectangular cartridges use half face respirators, could probably bust one cartridges open remove filter put think it’s cheap knockoff filter. absolutely feel drawing air filter put hand intake. air flows cover intake completely, leaks small pretty insignificant. Fan uses decent power lithium battery size thumb delivers juice needed. lasts like 2 hours speed 3, speed 2 produces air breathe anytime exercising, speed 1 perfect relaxing hard lasts like 10 hrs. Technology improved beyond imagine see obvious cheap snake oil this, try one plan return judge yourself, free shipping free returns Amazon. one 5000 really take every day. We've done pretty well overall. hospitals never overwhelmed, generally everyone wearing masks, deaths remained low.

We're perfect we've done ok Like I've said before. Remember extra security measures brought 9-11? remove them? Even [the press] showing [ineffective] [were] Measures even begun rigorously enforced right now. Thing I’m things wear mask much humanly possible. way around hostile. Terrible numbers. Nuh uh. probably ok person sometimes asshole. Wow, people cheering dystopia virus 99.25% survival rate.

China really number everyone. Honestly, I'm pretty antisocial. can't imagine twat wear mask protect neighbors out. cool. standing TyRaNnY. finding new ways let us know uncertain terms penis envy. yep two, agreed!!

I guess number 3 would go something like b12.  Anti-masker presume? come made sport of. *Ok look*  Fits already know republicans vaccine work? Sorry forgot reply this!

I'm player, DM...yet. I've enjoying roleplaying aspect voices, really enjoying creativity combat. also love flavoring classes something else traditionally. bottle vitamin gels, say take food. way vitamin needs fat order absorb properly. place sells vitamin tablets? never saw like anywhere. Sounds like Democrats general actually. returned core argument, realise going around tangents get anywhere you. 

Now, reason keeping healthcare system protected important reduce amount die covid, also possible die causes well doctors busy dealing virus. 

The main argument, again, economic one, already proven Swedish economy among least affected despite focus exports.

These valid measurements considered success.

Norway contrast, nearly good benchmark completely arbritrary, reason use handled almost surprisingly well, make every country worse.

I repeat, Norway well make every country worse. I'm going honest, meant could get job again, lose car apartment, worry health pandemic, I'd totally willing go back full lockdown months. would much better dragging misery, I'm tired bank calling everyday going ""their"" money. landlord calling everyday asking going ""his"" money reminding eviction moratoriums running soon enough. lost job started, one lined March job eventually store go under. question accept limited options expose possibility catching disease medical coverage take care of, so... know, risk dying. accept I'm going lose everything homeless, issue honestly. chronic depression is, give cats I've 10 years I'll kill I'm alone. yeah, I'm full shutdown help curb thing lose everything. Damn qualifies make statements? Might another critical point. First get vaccine population stops caring. Thanksgiving America late November (Nov 26). people celebrate normal, cases rise mid December, everyone's traveling home Christmas holidays. lol subreddit platforming flawed polls agree results. news today “water wet” Yep, know someone living NYC appears still part outside-- wearing mask without complaint stores walks outside even. But... they're also regularly attending small parties indoors without mask on. get it, there's much time spend cooped tiny apartment break free, shocked NYC's numbers continue rise. opinion give unquantifiable subject.

And, stated opinion clearly.

EDIT. clarity true, vaccination constantly given booster. British like scraping bottom barrel. I’m glad viewing matter objectively. Like said before, whether people buying Chinese government says doesn’t really matter. matters learn experience, without blindfolded prejudices. make observation long medium term immunity virus around significant numbers half year?

Can predict medium long-term effects vaccine without observing them? Spoken like person never lived China. Visit park 1 am, plenty people running around. Parents happy letting daughters walk home dark. There's simply feeling perpetual fear/stress major US city. hard explain, really takes big weight shoulders. Get elective procedures screenings done immediately.

Actually todo list today get scheduled. shortage real. Maybe spend less time internet People purposely attend gatherings knowing they’re infected charged way someone purposely gives HIV someone would...

This disgusting worse someone calling hoax wearing mask. endangerment JNJ shits them. Precisely position, schools (especially primary schools, people think distance learning work delusional) one thing believe worth keeping open even cost additional deaths, I'm deluding contribute spread, close contact obviously does.

Also, happy cake day! Oh nice someone party, hopefully find attending fine least. Agree, smart things. One thing always fascinated though don’t push risk lowest possible level areas life COVID? maybe never taking highway avoid 60-70 mph speeds. never even single beer restaurant (in times) may slightly impair driving. allowing children ride bike there’s real possibility could get seriously injured tens thousands Americans year?

And many risk factors (like driving highway) affect ourselves, others around us, like COVID. big deal vaccine comes out! believe mask help stop particles escaping upper respiratory tract coating surrounding environment corona-goo.
With small protection offered wearer. friend manages health department, CDC guidelines, according her, indicating contract within 90 days getting it. said, guidelines changing time, knows long they're going saying that.  must look ridiculous that. I´d say it´s good. Even get news november december would awesome hope people really thinking might be. believe schools essential, terrible closed year, benefits society schools open outweigh harm. 

However, think currently need closed. 
I really pushed edge school brother-in-law teaches announced would require masks ""too political"" (fortunately, soon after, state issued mandate). CDC released guidelines safely reopening schools Trump administration declared hard/expensive schools open basically without quasi-believable safety rules intact. 
*I willing sacrifice teachers lazy even try right way!* know. reference no. 3 guys bench next parking lot far remember, one artile.

No idea video saw genuine. posted many videos Wuhan beginning taken down, assume CCP. say true not.

The Polish situation reminds video, regardless genuine not. Yeah, were. brutal too. government also overseen contct tracing fall apart, members parliment caught event broke rules implemented literally day general mood low.

Meanwhile, household got it. oldest works Sonic outbreak employees. :/ Check discussion /r/Masks4All lots people won’t follow rules second full lockdown can’t see feasibly police whole country.

This shout mission accomplished actually over, over. 

I appreciate leaders kept warning us expect [second wave. [Respatory challenge.

After Melbourne went second lockdown convinced we'd one Thanksgiving. avoided Christmas lockdown still looks likely. joke mean? Even UK infecting people gotten vaccine. Let's hope tide turns less die general.♡♡ one? write brand model? hopes vaccine beyond stupid. There's guarantees whatsoever effective vaccine ever arrive.  many lives destroy process becoming police state?  delaying inevitable inflicting harm necessary economy.  turning third world country go police state lockdown near future cases start popping again. future virus mutates slightly every year there's many distinct variations? Kind like rhinovirus vaccines... permapooched? Life expectancy plummets 50? Population declines?

It always assumed one major reasons flu disappears summer comes back late fall children going back school. tried get trial Boston got denied. high risk enough. guess office 3 people going warrant it. Makes sense. said anything wearing mask caring people sick?

You're basically proving point way communication used primarily influence audience agenda, may objective may presenting facts selectively encourage particular synthesis perception, *or using loaded language produce emotional rather rational response information presented*.

The point article manipulate wearing mask asserting correct thing asserting Bad Person don't.

People checklist mentality.

They identify things they're supposed do, list items negotiable.

But virus negotiate. virus spread primarily human contact. virus care less look excuses human contact.

Trump Point made. wearing cloth mask 15 minutes day shopping supermarket, I'm sure fine. need multi-pronged approach nothing table handle it.

Treatment always necessary, since virus thing never go away. life never return normal without vaccine, matter good treatments may may get. Without vaccine, last year new normal. CDC still recommends 10-14 days isolation exposure. refuse isolate currently?

I know do. always will, essential. got disease, would isolate least 10 days, would to.

I lose home... people might. lose car. power would get cut off. Losing 2 weeks productivity would cripple people. understand wearing mask protects wearer. care either? :( think right. lot people clearly *do* overestimate well masks work. think simply wear go back living working before. can't.

Masks + Outdoors + 6' feet distancing combine make things pretty safe. Move indoors, sudden risk increases 20x. Take masks, risk doubles. on. one measure (except literally staying home, single family home, 24/7) 100% effective, need combined. Masks panacea, also clearly help.

Oh well nevermind! Come on, man. Many, many scientists agree me. I'm anyway anti-vaxxer across board nonsense. There's vaccine HIV yet, why? vaccine development easy? effective *treatment* HIV. 

My concern whether effective, single dose, vaccine developed. Multiple doses annual booster drive vaccination rates.

That's see multiple approaches successful. Yes, envision technology improvements rapid testing important vaccine. Remember test, track isolate? That's still sound process even though US gave it.

Just layperson's opinion.  South Dakota...it starting get ugly According RKI, schools contribute little outbreak Germany, major concern: Must swim Nah, mental asylums made things worse disagree NY reason virus spread across country? even click article linked?

What's point living without liberty? post blatant misinformation mods allow anything suggests herd immunity meme we're gonna apocalyptic second wave upvoted top. posts around constantly seem contradict one another, goddamn. Italy seems particularly vulnerable long term restrictions, due deriving high percentage GDP tourism. live Japan, actual takes money tourism Italy year year, percentage much lower - 7% vs. 13% . Despite damage enormous, government begun questionable campaigns spur domestic travel, still keeping international tourism locked down. EU member Italy would probably face resistance try heavily regulate border crossings. You’re tough spot. Buona fortuna! Well, brought up, US based site mostly US based users.

Antisocial personality Narcissistic personality sure, say ""personality disorder"" misleading. guess need sure say introverted anti-social (in regards empathy). like around people, certainly empathy wearing mask everywhere protect others. also believe need help less fortunate. sense I'm anti-social. Makes slightly confusing, I'm good saying I'm introverted avoid getting confused lumped types people care someone dies stupidity. wasnt enough, iirc gov fauled implementing proper contact tracing mechanism Well, going poor (or even terrible) mental health care almost mental health care exactly step up. Ummm mean immunity goes away. T-cell immunity exists without antibodies. Considering lack widespread reinfections, pretty clear people still immune.

The take-home point article be: ""Antibodies tests unreliable way calculating % immune population."" introvert anexiety im antisocial, still wear mask Don’t cry abt anymore Sure, keep head buried sand man. Death FINAL, coming back it, would hedge bets 100 times 100 means lowering chance dying anything. That's wear seatbelt, look ways crossing street, got vaccines get blood work done every year. certainly come ""risk"" adverse effect occurring certainly worse death. Cmon little bro stop crying it, we’ve seen multiple studies I.e. Qatar study t-cell response well observations little reinfections popped last 8 months, don’t cry subreddit look science accept post added nothing new Bush read book

Impressive, General Bush Sure kid. gave office wouldn´t wear mask... xD I’d rather educate children lateral thinkers go slippery slope censorship. 

Give people tools think logically rationally easily identify misinformation. people don’t want wear mask would group don’t return shopping trolleys.... espouse personal responsibility, never practice themselves. pooped large ""C"" yesterday. impressed. reminds we're shitty situation. seeing you. Lost cause respect man. lot cases imported East Europe. come Poland construction workers. voluntary tests borders. shut December. They'll need full quarantine testing then, they'll denied entry. done March. also see rest country high NY? Probably read article linked. GRIFFFITTHHH!!!! can't eat 3 hours think need re-evaluate life. Yuck been. Also anecdotal, 3 college friends got sick back March, tested positive, sick testing positive again. 

Less 25% US gotten sick. I’d imagine it’s partly aren’t guaranteed even exposed it, partly people asymptomatic, partly getting sick realized maybe need wear mask. 

But reinfection certainly happened. isn’t massive wave, nobody would even expect right anyways. numbers would far less normal infection OB, right? 80s? Asia Middle East seem ok interesting. definitely check Sweden’s Universal Health Care system try states. seem something. couple reports people reinfected genetically different strain. Easy find Google.

Masks protect others. 

Last all, speak himself. Nobody gives shit stick head sand takes scientific studies going personally take study, post statement back info/data. Otherwise prepared mocked. importantly logic behind topic what's bad. Literally improvement would look great compared bad spring was. Declaring victory point disingenuous 1.16m people world would disagree you, can't they're dead.

Murdoch fuck right thought established summer could get virus again. Especially handful people already caught again. 70,000 people US got covid today. 2-4 weeks, 1000 dead. know yet.

How people blase faced that? start basing severity virus mortality infection rate? Cases US climbing steadily since Sept 7, deaths remained same. imply mortality rate actually getting lower? Funny. wear mask exhibit traits toward anyone Todd It.  completely agree cant compare flu COVID. They're different types virus. Odds might worse, sure, never guarantee. story Poland, except even worse average Polish nurse 50 years old, something like third risk group. Weird, see masks Trump political rallies, would imply that... never mind. I've heard great things Delta.

Thanks sharing information masks. Lots interesting information masks thread.

Good luck US November 3rd. Sending good neighborly thoughts. Exactly. sorry able see family either. sucks like said it’s best safe would need roughly 2 weeks hit 32 deblind study, yet, late November best estimate. Today lower, 12,687 cases, that's still cold comfort, still equal 355,000 US cases forget lack access medical care Everyone needs cabin woods own! Oh wish.

I think it’s also matter scale - see dozen flu cases person years, four own, none bad, think that’s flu always like people like you.

My experience worse, make effort avoid happening anyone would infect along way got sick.
I’m glad I’m one infected mom! teacher different state, probably caught kids.

But also family various medical fields - you’ve seen two thousand flu cases ranging severity moderately miserable quickly-dead, everyone toddlers waitresses grandmas, deal guilt kid killed parent/grandparent bringing home, weigh risk/hassle/cost/benefit ratio flu shot differently.

I’m US, availability custom cost affect attitude, too. think 45% adults get flu shot annually. Doesn’t take much effort, often free work insurance community programs (unlike rest terribly expensive medical care), pharmacy without doctor.

Since cost hospitalization treatment bad case bankrupt/severely financially hurt us, literally can’t afford risk flu, free/cheap shot lowers risk, lot us take it. Individuals may rich, population whole poor, can’t afford medical care.
(2/3 bankruptcies US linked medical issues - either bills themselves, lost work losing jobs people get sick/injured. social safety nets pitiful paid sick/vacation time required employers.) people, refuse wearing mask actually medical reason: Psychopathy. People Facebook =\= friends. Except that's is. gets blasted shows 0 knowledge scientific method scientific studies for. rest assholes.

Imagine could diagnose people ""asshole""-personality disorder. problem common mental disorders (they are), people mental disorders running county / states explains lot feel you. family split US, Canada, U.K. really sucks able see them, least we’re safe. Whatever put food probably help, countless people chronic diseases using medication meant short term (eg: PPIs) probably kind side effects. 


Permanent sleep withdrawal since pushing conditions (both work, also living situations) promotes healthy sleep fuck people up, too. know someone died...... please this. I'm NC too. may eventually get reinfected well would probably useless. mother doctor seeing patients 7 months hard hit area managed get yet. Please this!!! Frustrating news, deal breaker. Vaccine shots seasonal then. meant fuck. wouldn’t. There’s evidence getting lower initial dose lowers severity ultimate disease it’s going really hard try get low dose way ensures you’ll infected all.  dont see youre downvoted. clearly currently comparable.  United States' current systems help need help fundamentally broken dire need reform.

Prisons need changed form punishment form rehabilitation (just look Norway it). Current mental health services lacking nonexistent. Homelessness also taken care properly. think read somewhere there's currently empty houses whole USA homeless people, that's case, something's seriously wrong current system. That's prison system for!

Oh course violent able commit crime, that's state problem ie: that's personal problem maybe go church support network God. personality disorder “being asshole?” Yes. several outbreaks someone studied virology demands science, sure like make claims 100% proven true. even accounting fact data sets schools incomplete hard trace schools require negative test come back, time student shows symptoms quarantine 10-14 days (or doctor's clearance, necessarily test), results test. student could potentially positive, never test stats would never show it.

Also, recommendations open schools community transmission lower 5%, true uniformly across United States. got one, it’s actually awesome. delivers fresh p100 filtered air face without lungs work. soon stop exhaling feel warm stale air lingers mask replaced fresh cool breeze. 🤤 massive levels undiagnosed mental illnesses country, glorify sociopathy many ways, masculinity toxic fragile. Couple guinea pig world wide disinformation techniques none shocking. guy psychologiolizes. Delays infection rate good sign, pointing prevention measures actually helping avoiding Covid. good eligible first batches vaccine already produced, though. timing close least factor. well feel stupid....thanks correcting me.  Agree concerning vaccine. effective. second wave gonna worse first? fear factor clearly anymore hopefully complete lockdowns. similar situation March cards? France comes next lockdown helpful course.

When Macron said would could prevent second lockdown initially assumed meant would taking tried tested solution Asia make sure theyd never it. Unfortunately meant, haha, fuck all, dont give shit. Chinese concentration camps arent fake news. China authoritarian dictatorship closest thing 1984 currently around. idea freedom ridiculous think found one! Fuck off, Kyle ( searching manager) No. would completely side agree empathy profoundly needed denialism refusal accept basic epedimiological science heart discussion. 

The science clear profound regarding Corona virus, say people cannot held accountable actions juiced propaganda allows almost actions history forgiven. 

We past empathy barreling towards scientific realism. room excuse ignorance one lead viral infection subsequent death another. still friends them? baby boomers raised bunch people went extreme trauma WWII know about/believe therapy. something it. doubt, exercise personality disorder blaming sub. love idea. would require education. I've worked many people know *how* this, even afforded them. regularly people take time off, responding emails, logging work, etc supposed vacation. always tell respond emails review work they're out.

So, guarantee items listed, we'd need somehow teach people utilize them. It’s also linked lung disorder. Oh know, exact thing still happening spread harder track down. 


So great job us! never solved problem, made harder find! really resent kind broad judgement hard work, love working long hours totally driven money, I'm diligent mask wearing far know mental disorders desperately wanting actual freedom kids. read virus mutating way regular flu does. good change vaccine Covid last lot longer annual flu vaccine. ask getting better. buck stops where? Oh that's right, republicans take responsibility things go right....pun Australian... Well, helps explain Switzerland's 220,000 US equivalent cases last three days--Everybody acting like virus either gone, denial, conspiring keep gatherings like secret authorities like game ☝️Exhibit everybody Please scroll parent comment understand said. antisocial profile linked higher scores personality questions related “callousness, deceitfulness, hostility, impulsivity, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, risk-taking”, antisocial traits which, study notes, “are typically present people diagnosed Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)"".

So US call Trump fans. think people bad breath BBC giddy news, nothing like causing panic get clicks way up! Asylums mental health care worse prisons. rosy view asylums. Nobody got help horrible places. That's 0.1% diagnosed cases, real total infections. Yeah. think Went park last Sunday Dublin. I'd say 70% attenders using masks still. little faith place lockdown 2 work well first one natural herd immunity like worst excuse fucking response virus. they’re not. They’re hub infection, common knowledge. definitely correlation in-person schools case increases, least areas open. [Since reopening schools, children cases increased ton, making 10% US cases (as opposed previous die supposed continue good fight liberty? said independent group would need analysis results, would forward FDA additional analysis. could take 3 week read hit target infection level. That's true though. Look Europe. Many countries locked hard seeing resurgence. Lockdowns delay inevitable. accessible, yes! often comply safe drinking water standards. Lead beeing one latest examples reduction lead pipeing decreases violent crime significantly. also lot issues. statements true though. dont contradict eachother.

Excessdeaths calculated way total deaths per capita.

Im also saying (if True) says anything Sweden coronas corona responsen. Victor. 

If true extremely interesting though. would like know reasons behind it. 



Also respected journalist mentioned post Emanuel. looking understand, since objective/good im looking forward post it. I’m saying, wave arbitrary significant. numbers importantz shithead, said "" Weird diagnosed disorder "" statement already fact diagnosed wit one. Don’t talk communist talk.... source: uneducated, brainwashed American sure that? I've seen others saying maintain antibodies years/decades main vaccines viruses. argue science Facebook? mean could always include “that”, example could “ study finds wearing mask linked personality disorder article said responsible surges, open rushed manner, people would think opening schools opening without health measures. former high school open since August person school 50% online 50% zoom knowledge 0 cases coronavirus. Except isn’t nonsense? Seems medical consensus. Whether you’re less prone infection, idk. certainly get twice. Anecdotal evidence, personally know people gotten twice (tested), 4+ months apart. Health Service dead long Covid, much, ruling party blaming everybody else this.
National TV showing happy people economy growing. Nothing changed Eastern Europe. Yeah get KN95s N95, 3M masks fit much better far higher quality Read: “We won’t reduce restrictions 70% vaccinated” still important T-cell immunity much damaging host.

Link this? ""shopping cart test"" one see someone's asshole leave shopping cart middle parking lot instead putting back place? That's secondary cause, it? None would ever happened China shit together lab Wuhan. untrained cops guns. Wtf? post tagged academic report British tabloid. Jesus christ reddit Nice bird pun Except literally 2-3 month immunity period. Source: people got sick twice. become immune would impossible. 

I already gave list reasons isn’t wide spread you’d believe. didn’t respond those. Wow fucked up. Sorry hear I’ve seen KN95s Staples store online Maybe help thing found. ""research"" tab ""Policy Practice"" find:

It says corona case-mortality rate 0.23% even lower according author. peer-reviewed, also literary review article, whose sources denote case compared death toll. 

Can take true scientific truth like ??? 

For rest.. Tell it. cry badly standard information people. twisted can't even educate them. 

Btw - know find strand PCR tests for? looking end conspiracy crap personality disorder? LOL ...the author must brain disorder... huge proponent schools open. 

The societal benefits schools something need accepted even driver Covid spread

That said, mind honestly believe schools least PARTIALLY responsible Covid explosion seen worldwide past month three P100 half-face respirators extra filters

Those leagues comfortable regular masks. feel like scuba regulators help breathe deeply. thought nicked everyone else’s food Anyone alternate link research/topic? see “independent.co.uk” immediately dodge rabbit hole ads represents. Well said. vocally admit republican Kansas, means side scum like Sam Brownback Susan Wagle. mention Oompa Loompa White House, Mitch McConnel, Lindsay Graham, etc.

Stop supporting bad humans maybe you’ll stop called it. thought. thanks. election imminent excited, reddit tons people campaigning.  reason still issue ahead them. Modi really looks like he’s pick nose thumbnail wonder there’s talk scaling icu beds possibly re-establishing field hospital, case. course expected cases rise, it’s still unnerving. Fastest rate increase reported cases

I'm honestly sure understand logically convoluted statement is. hope glasses little bit rose tinted going forward, still seem really bone pick Sweden highest single day total entire epidemic...

we went days ago, still board idea testing matters? Norway went ahead published [estimated cases spring (blue) compared reported cases 

Feels like common knowledge now, reason like make things seem worst possible way. almost like using opposite rose tinted glasses. Cheer dude! way get vitamin normal level bake sun 15 hours day... Sigh.... vaccines development currently stage 3 testing. mass testing several thousand people. Vaccines cleared use successfully proving effective safe stages 1-3. yes vaccines passed standard vaccine testing, arguably many tested many people standard stage 3 testing.

As much people think it’s true, vaccines undergo long term safety testing approval population. Never done.

http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development 04/29 - USA passes 1 million Covid-19 cases 
06/11 - USA passes 2 Million cases (42 days per mm)

10/16 - USA Passes 8 million cases (21 days per mm) 
10/27 - USA pass 9 Million cases (11 days) 
 
this data gathered searching ""USA passes X million cases"" looking date published. Wasn’t study University Arizona proved stable immunity least seven months? seem remember also hypothesizing immunity could last much longer, around 2 years. That's best side effect could imagine. Cool. sit internet day. help list 100 ad fillers want? want give non-western ones sound silly bring drop point. see type day, noise people like live here. think important remember looking people vaccine getting infected all, also getting less sick still catch it. believe flu vaccines work way. There's chance could still get way milder didn't, obviously COVID would make huge difference well.  Notice they're &amp; outnumbered lately? Love got downvoted nationalising hospitals single payer could done easy hospitals worth 0$  never stop learning too. Feels amazing read good news vaccine. Faucci saying soon November? Wonderful. Hope everyone ok. Everyday another day close end this. important factually correct times like these? Spreading narrative one person controls direction entire country fact large government apparatus making decision dangerous leads distrust. Saying Tegnell ""defending"" him, correct. Yes, major vaccines trialled Europe US, except Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, require two doses 4-6 weeks apart, full immunity probably kick 6-ish weeks second dose. wont' able throw away mask go massive indoor gatherings immediately receiving first dose, end clearly sight. calculate data week 42 percentage positive DNA tests 3.86% week 41 3.14% week 40 2.88%. Damn. wonder bad implications developing brain? Well, people believe ultimately nothing really done respiratory virus. see movie government just... loosened quarantine rules. contact someone infected people house free roam about. rules fucked - quarantine 10 days infected someone house likely would still infectious quarantine ends. symptoms 10 days quarantine also free go. tests anyone.unless heavy onset symptoms.

Do people quarantine get financially supported? they're going comply. one agenda lol. fucking common sense children massing schools would huge vector virus transmission. care experts saying, reality sure themselves. take decades research realize wtf happening virus. 

Scientists moment looking incomplete data limited data. Yeah, right. Probably thought top. deficiency living Austin, Texas. I'm big gardener spend lot time outside. doctor time told people deficient. never stopped taking supplements that. U think? Anyone know whether research determined low Vitamin levels contributed severe Covid opposed severe Covid causing low levels Vitamin D? is! Found afterwards, article mentions study quoted Dr. Faust one. replied sticky comment update. Mississippi positivity rate 100%. testing maxed out, showing growth cases. guess we'll finally know answer age-old question: IQ negative value? vaccine tested long term side effects approval general use. Approval general use happens successful stage 3 testing conducted several thousand people. Long term effects checked stage 4 investigations many years happens used general population.

The vaccines currently development tested thoroughly vaccine taken. Honestly insulting lump mentally different people likes anti-maskers. 

They're totally capable wearing masks understanding anyone would it. 

They're 'different' (I use term loosely, they're really aside person using word mean certain group people, unfairly so), they're assholes. crazy?? Wearing mask signal d*eep st@te ch!ld r@pist! true, saw Qa#on's Facebook page! consider trade off. Highway driving actually fairly safe, injuries per miles driven pretty small, especially eliminate risk factors end - driving drunk/high/texting/exhausted (though drivers *are* still risk factor you). goes cycling, risk serious injury per time relatively small.

The consideration exponentiation. Simply put, injuries per mile driven/biked pretty linear. drivers means injuries, adding 1,000,000 drivers adds 1,000x many injuries adding 1,000. Linear correlation. COVID experiences exponential growth, adding 1,000,000 exposures increases infections *greater* rate adding, 1,000. huge problem means need *more* 1000x much medical intervention 1,000x many people risking infection.

tl;dr COVID much riskier driving highway riding bike, risk scales *extremely fast* people risk exposure. wish government messaging something like ""we soldiers war now."" Soldiers take risks protect other. 

Taking vaccine safely tested tens thousands trial participants low risk willingly take protect fellow soldier-citizens. south Isn’t full bunch backwards redneck racist hicks treating like pretty shitty. plenty progressive hotspots bigger cities. 8% positivity rate incredibly high. Things getting better Florida all. FAKE NEWS- FLORIDA GOVERNOR That's still COVID though, even COVID. deaths considered COVID deaths-no. would many happened pandemic thing? Also probably no. hate here. Maybe we’ve *verified* 24 reinfections. even millions people infected, I’m sure many expect documented given constrained resources fact maybe half people get asymptomatic. I’m certain number people who’ve received positive Covid test negative one much, much higher 24.

AFAIK, would need coordinated focus people who’ve already infected remain high risk reinfection. incidence virus still low relative overall population, think group (outside healthcare workers) would concern. AFAIK, effort actually follow observe incidence reinfection. remember noticing Italy March. Even lockdown, loads house parties, including all-day house parties students. confirm, initial jab back June, booster 3 weeks ago :-) Lol ""highest single day increase"" reported 5-7 days earlier on. 
Also said ""might"", dont see either. fact: average daily cases last week around 1200 per day. felt like starting argument bc fuck idk December 1st. they're going back normal. Absolutely. massively bad idea. multiple serulogical tests April/may find percent population antibodies time.

I don’t know obsessed making shit look worse is. Might that’s another story another time, friend. looking last comment. get point either trying make though. notably, kept talking studies never linked single one. see interests cannot wait go back ""normal"". convince people like unwilling acknowledge comparison like silly, facts words change mind. takes boot. hurts people en masse realize plastic surgery drinking bars something humans give fuck about, however people like make life it. beyond insane. Good luck. Ah yes, EU citizen largely avoid want become Swedish citizen. necessarily. We're seeing loads cases hospitals unprepared. Treatment hit miss since medical staff better idea works doesn't. People aware, even everybody taking seriously, large groups wear masks, wash hands, social distance, etc. Big events taking place like back Feb/March, super spreading-type events banned Europe. may bad vibe certain people saying it, testing widespread too, way confirmed cases. Back March tested people symptoms who'd Italy China. innocent back then. Right...what’s low number? agree. I’m tired public health authorities complaining shutdown measures haven’t followed sufficiently. know won’t be. certain. matter much wish might otherwise. plan accordingly. Well good Republic@ns. expected worse based last weeks increase. saying update evaluation based data? reversed.  interesting actually. mean, cases started going soon schools opened again, much else changed. summer cases extremely low. I'm pretty sure spreads school. children asymptomatic often, probably even get tested.

What understand use summer prepare schools this. Online classes example. good bad news guess. Good infection rate lower enough people (32) got virus de-blind, bad answer Pfizer/BioNTech's study. thing happened Oxford/AZ UK. really think USA could eradicated covid back March? That’s happened Europe. ‘Just stay home’ empathetic realistic message seven months in, end sight. Spinal Inflamation: Fatigue, Rash: Vaccine literally restarted even though know caused spinal inflammation. point really safer people 60 99.9999% chance survival experience unknown side effects, long-term effects vaccine short term already worse vaccine take?  Won’t impact release vaccine trial run longer regardless. mean _prefer_ wear one. wear around house fun. goes pants. fucked vaccine discussion held context election take place. Sick shallow misdirected US become. Also highlights health safety isn’t driving factor covid...political corporate agendas are. positivity rate reported weekly basis, usually Thursdays week before. report yet previous week weeks prior nice graph: lowest first two weeks September - 1% increasing slowly ever since - week 42 3.8%, week 3.1% read whole convo think couldn’t converse😂😂😂 Nvm. misread comment. correct it’s stupid assume India’s dropping cases result herd immunity. 

But think hypothesis unlikely. number people refuse comply rules reaches critical mass becomes impossible rule.

Turns way 99% able make voices heard since dawn history  2021 need get vaccine + booster mask everywhere see concert visit family without fear it. TBH i'm glad mask wearing finally normalized US (to degree, obviously anti-masker problem). People using regularly flu season cold regardless like commonplace lot countries. What's wrong dude, can't converse like normal human being?  thanksgiving ohio shutdown John Jane Doe going able get it? Next year? assume first responders rich people access first. grown concerned fact one mainstream sphere yet asked: ""what wrong entire time measures taken?"" 

Governments unanimously entered lockdowns assumption completely effective, something actually established discouraged [experts guy eradicated turn, blaming cases misbehaviors population: ""it's strategy faulty; misbehaving horrible person."" wonder divided. 

If strategy works, work across board. can't say lockdowns ""work"" different countries using strategy yielding different results. stay inside! Thanks sharing, I've seen similar numbers. also closing random places hairdresser, saloon gyms retarded likely account &lt; 1% infections. updating testing rate usually Thursdays week before, Thu last week. Week 42 saw 3.9 % 150k tests. It’s misinformation central. human immune system responds coronavirus like every virus. said vulnerable people ones immunocompromised systems ones obese. want put people jail wearing mask. wearing mask, maybe even COVID wear mask, punishment knowingly infecting someone HIV. California Law Reduces Penalty Knowingly Exposing Someone  Hey look you, asshole anonymous internet. 

You're difference maker. curiosity, feel need defend Tegnell? strange thing defend someone power who, along others, made incredibly poor decisions already.

Or mean entire FHMs fault? understand. Agree. Fundamentally neither meaningful contact tracing genuinely love calling Tr#mpers r!ght w!ngers ""retar&amp;ed"" insult r*tarded people. agree, though. hurtful.  Public opinion shifting light abject failure American systems government local, state, federal levels effectively deal virus. live Ottawa, we’ve stage 2 3 weeks probably going another month. Everything take oh gyms sports closed corruption absolute power. Again? lock first time? half-ass patchwork quilt local decisions various states. national even extensive regional lockdown. today chance catch two old friends. talking 'plandemic'. like - wtf??? understand people belive covid earlier year literally countries seen periods high infections. wrong humankind? Lily pads filled pond. hey I'm antisocial wear mask. frankly think wearing mask lets antisocial.. distancing, whatnot. dont confuse antisocial asshole *reading* (skimming) article looks like compared covid patients control group. quite coincidence. otherwise mightve said bc people spending time inside usual year. feel like many restrictions around Europe seem working. They're closing public life infections currently spreading mainly private life situations. 

That bit unclear actually, cases traced happen private events infections can't traced. People obviously remember birthday party 6 days ago know infected public transport. 

Concentrating private events thought made sense weeks ago low infection numbers. higher unidentified background infections situation changed bit. user name checks out. read 20% develop immunity. others least 4 6 months think still data back it. Phew, American I’m glad hear president finally made decision! Maybe schools pushing keep sports going people still indoor weddings receptions MASKS SIGHT.......

\*sigh\* I'm skeptical scientific community days, also claimed virus transmit person person masks work early days. see virus spreads similarly coronaviruses, albeit contagious. surprised see ""revelation"" couple months children actually big factor spread. I'm sure someone get mad call anti science stance. topic acquired brain disorder years ago, brain fog one first things reported went acute chronic. endure brain fog day. feel ancient inside. It’s totally real horrible. 

Honestly speaking get place don’t daily relief it, that’ll sign it’s time go. Even “Putin” radioactive tea sharing brilliant leader, willing mandate wearing masks, cannot Drump? maybe month two vaccine released public

You ignoring reality logistics manufacturing distributing vaccine. take way longer months dose enough people end restrictions. Maybe assume words coming person opinion, without qualifier? 


Not peoples job protect ignorance. mean it’s pretty obvious works extent. Look Argentina example, +70 positivity rate Australia small island country. senate majority leader able adjourn congress? That’s crazy. Senate power Congress I’m hitting paywall one. people also believe invisible sky daddy.... know Liverpool Manchester, Nottingham's cases already declining announced put tier 3, increase tier even come effect Thursday. India passing us soon enough. USA #2. Sad. Link proof please. I’m honestly interested it. Agreed --- started wearing mask work soon come back, June. one else wore one mandate hit August. bars always packed yet store see least one person (usually more) wearing mask wearing incorrectly. Heck, even co-workers mine still keeping nose. state get it. People say thing Disneyland people absolutely love it. liking Disneyland deminish fact. 

It's got lot things, weather, big city, lots smaller areas within city unique communities, great food, lots do, lots see, lots history well good balance corporate community based identity. 

It's rarely many things one place well balanced. Wait. thought children virtually immune hoax? That's hilarious also sad. even automated system notify people via SMS seven months later, Hidalgo's family says answers suspected — otherwise healthy Hidalgo die hypertensive heart disease, Florida autopsy report stated — lungs showed damage associated Covid-19.

Yet another example Florida making efforts undercount COVID-19 deaths. I've finding women masks alluring...and forbidden. USA 300k+ excess deaths btw know sarcastic, case fatality rate varies [0.2% depending age. Comorbidities exacerbate mortality rate. death rate US dropped recently due better treatment covid knowledge, [many US hospitals currently straining load influx covid go hospital stuck triage mode, must rerouted distant hospital free ICU, there's chance receive level care would better times decrease survival chance. 
  
Btw, grandma's senior ""Water Wings"" swim group still scheduled 3pm. walk car? people US (myself included) little idea population European countries are. Without per capita information, basically like solving question chemistry class without listing units.

Your answer 247? 247 what? answer WRONG /every science teacher ever

Seriously though, think posts would better labelling quantity cases / million avoid lack context apples apples comparisons. Honestly fear I'll catch line waiting test lol yet can't remember last time mass killing occured perpetrated white guy home nation...

When shown mass shooting ""white guys home nation"" wanna deny facts spin it? GTFO racebaiter. 1-2 months ahead vaccine trials would mean point. many lives saved.

We finding mRNA quick turn vaccine research allowing challenge studies. Could actually turning corner now. (down)voted twice. commit felony? know what, every right continue wearing mask long want. long every right choose wear one. See easy is? Article says 41, died Lung damage Covid 19. Right call TF mean ""returning?"" 
This person house, sleeping couch, eating food since MARCH least. gave april opened everything back LIKE WOULD GO AWAY. Oh, like Cuomo put elderly virus back nursing homes, resulting highest deaths anywhere world?

Tell ""paved way."" fucked colossally. Maybe, knows? like FHM ruled masks completely, even might seem way sometimes. see necessary, they'll come new recommendations, simple that. meanwhile, free wear mask want anywhere like. Many people are, especially internationally, means spread within Europe anything else. breaking news, water confirmed wet Cardi B's vagina. Back weather, Tom. lot bad information masks start 2020. old studies inconclusive masks, unclear infection came primarily aerosols surfaces fear would shortage PPE hospitals. 
One old studies used masks dealt reducing influenza-infections showed non-medical staff figure use masks properly. data interpreted badly adjust fact improper usage also meant _not actually wearing masks_. Kanye douche bag. According polls, apparently US like 50/40/10. basically analogy, chances explosive diarrhea 40 percent ten percent swing. Lololol!

I think especially important acknowledge people agree with, typically. I'll first acknowledge Ford's relatively sound handling. things people able agree on, even politics.

Toronto helped beat SARs first time.  think standard nose mouth mask enough. think eyes covered I've heard, someone broke hotel quarantine caused super spreader event. Proper contact tracing performed uncontrolled exponential growth going state locked down. essentially thing left do. case load low enough contact tracing properly done, another large scale lockdown long probably avoided. important thing prevent happening contact trace, something missing, willingness implement restrictions early, localized softer lockdowns. Australia plays cards right time, might need another lockdown. drive windows down. ""greatest generation"" raised ninnys. spoiled coddled them. baby boomers - bunch whiney babies. pity. Thought lived first world countries. Continues 6-9 months? Fine.

Continues year? 2? 3? Absolutely it’s big deal. 

It’s mask either. point masks get covid-19 manageable levels. continue phased part normal life, “like seatbelts!!” crowd seems hope for. Well...he wasn’t wrong... remembeer isconsin getting 300, 400 cases day, thinking well. happened? Exactly. bet we'll nationL mandate president Orange next month sooner think protests weekend responsible COVID cases today?  

That’s *funny*. Well I'm Paris work, try get city much possible. Morale definitely improves get IDF. already week late... Yes, hopefully weather warms get relief. Winter shocking. Quick story really points surreal year been:

The first time played Wash Park, let's say liquid courage. got park, saw gal hijab's eyes light asked going play. hit first, came back, laid rhythms.

She absolutely blown away authentic (and halfway decent) play was. quite boost first time out.

Call whatever want. lost every single thread opened, you’ve retreated one last point. reason keeping healthcare system protected important reduce amount die covid, also possible die causes well doctors busy dealing virus.

Sure. striking right balance treating extraordinary victims virus ordinary victims key. Sweden failed at. fact supported four different sources sent you. disagree, please provide evidence, opinion made reasoning. Evidence. Studies. Expert opinions. Send anything supports opinion, please. Anything all. main argument, again, economic one, already proven Swedish economy among least affected despite focus exports.

You proven nothing. You’ve claimed something. Please provide evidence claim Sweden among least affected, taking account tourism, export, hit hardest. Relying export positive crisis. keep coming random things easily disproven. definition layman wanting argue details understand nothing of. support everything say source, you’ve given single one. valid measurements considered success.

No. crisis preventing deaths. Sweden failed at. You’re trying cherrypick least terrible measures make Sweden look better. contrast, nearly good benchmark completely arbritrary, reason use handled almost surprisingly well, make every country worse.

No. I’m fucking tired making shit accusing same. I’m using Norway example literally comparable country world Sweden. I’ve sent study done experts agree me. repeat, Norway well make every country worse.

Sure. makes Sweden lot worse, since experts agree Sweden done Norway did, **thousands deaths could avoided, cost economy.** opinion. It’s argument I’ve thought up. opinion epidemic experts around world. counter argument overwhelming evidence? Crickets. FYI people Melbourne, part, got $3000 per month sit home lost job, pretty damn good (financially) most. fact people increased savings period spending less. 

How comment specific countries lockdown it. Well, would give place go enjoy unregulated, Christian/Sharia theocratic oligarchy health care, live Tr#ump-quality housing go work unregulated coal plants. need treatment black lung disease/cancer/covid/diabetes/whatever, hold pancake breakfasts pay it!

See, problem solved. Hard say highly dependent group catching it. Could 10x higher 10x lower elderly people higher/lower part 5191 would expected random sample. Hopefully it’s higher fraction young people, reporting seems suggest. US Constitution grants inherent right freedom movement, includes interstate travel. See Saenz v. Roe Coq10 imo. humans culling narcissistic herd want survive.

what exactly suggesting? Right track. Sad. hate salad bars sneeze guards food. taking away liberty sneeze food!!!!  


It's bad enough wear shirt shoes! Sounds like curfew actively making things worse people sleepovers. Much love! What? Yet another study proving pieces shit fact pieces shit. Personally think pretty dumb think children ""immune"" names saying. Obviously immediately, it'll take years really know. RemindMe! 30 days everyone live different world life normally revolve around working? told lockdown 2 years instead would sound like lottery something, something would ease into. Sure, missed trip Europe, better year easily occupy indefinitely.

The easing happened started funding it, decided anything anymore let everything expire people stuck messes reduced hours, lower pay, job unemployment all. pleasure! That's alot people hospital covid Changed life take these! really sucks magnesium oxide sold cheapest version... bioavailable might well nothing then. Why? test capacity gets stressed, graph looks exponential. Positive testing rate increases much worring number. 20 percent positive rate insane.

/s Interesting colleges lower schools. data shows schools low risk relative workplaces, dining, events, religious gatherings. honestly expect remove security airports one day?

I expect measures ever removed think threat ever gone. threats can't eliminated people world allow happen. Security measures airports definitely perfect pretty asinine time, getting plane serious weapon easy anymore. dropping 20-30% tests won’t affect amount cases? Oh yes, probably. Nicely put, agree, stop works even now.  I’ve tried civil Reddit. incredibly divisive polarized topics like this, it’s simply worth time try go detail you, you’ll unlikely listen anyway. caught different mood maybe would spend time tell you’re wrong, can’t arsed right now. Merkel apparently wants light lockdown imho seem working many neighboring countries. Remember Merkel kind person makes tough choices. confirm.

I knew somebody once, short-temper. Always wanted fight. Always wanted yell. 

And claim people's stuff, own.

Saw local store, weeks ago.
He walked without mask. Like nothing going on..... Magnesium citrate cause lot laxative effects (oh know see post made today fucked up...) long avoid Mg Oxide, take forms also bioavailable. take magnesium glycinate.

I read really good NICB meta study helps depression god damn, me. take Vitamin Magnesium supplements daily. path hell paved good intentions? Join us! getting chilly... temperatures drop, set FAH client CPUs GPUs... Maybe even add GPU two.. make great heaters!

This find mean COVID19 projects FAH complete. Indeed ongoing. Currently FAH client GPUs working [Project ACE2 receptor binding domain project managed University Illinois Urbana-Champaign. imagine must actually there? quote cited, man kept strict scientific terminology. MRI RMI? sure - acronym know Magnetic Resonance Imaging. salmon pull thing think:

* Ow back.
* I'm straight right? (checks pants) That's say ""You know Trump admitted caught it, calling liar?"" 


head explodes. reopen?

Because economic commercial exchanges way intense, even ignoring tourism. Import-export flows France Germany alone larger NZ's entire economy IIRC. closed borders, German factories literally risk able keep running whole supply chain would face endless logistic disruptions, starting travel times. alone would wreak havoc several countries' SMEs environments hugely rely German market. that's one many examples.

From outside quite hard understand important free movement within EU. New Zealand already way ""closed"" single EU countries even normal circumstances.  What’s actually shut rural America? Fauci says still first wave he's leading expert. personally think third wave. Compare possible baseline [about 40% Americans vitamin Well that’s depressing.

Wouldn’t vaccine risk backfiring way? opposite US. extroverted ""people"" people can't stand talk mask. makes sense!! One pertinent part:

""The future cost approved vaccine contentious issue pharmaceutical groups including AstraZeneca, received hundreds millions dollars public money fast track development. Some companies said outset develop vaccine profit. Others, AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson, agreed provide doses cost basis least long pandemic lasts."" Pretty sure everyone dealing COVID shit become callous hostile. Imagine? happened. Seatbelts airbags subject conspiracy theories saying kill injure people save. think Trump lock country deaths surpass ones March April?  Religion sets people type idiotic binary thinking. ratios percentages. need multiple 100 get percentage. Stop spreading misinformation can’t read scientific studies correctly.  Absolute pathetic them, whole last months. cases high? course first say sky falling. (this is) intriguing inconclusive piece research effect COVID brain,” Hill said.

OK, honestly, fake news. I'm pretty much opposite Covid denier gotta draw line somewhere absolute unfounded hysteria. cursor downvote button, exactly measure 'brain age'? NOTHING scientific this. enough legitimate shit worry bleak situation. One tiny silver lining service industry hurts read. younger daughter supposed start kindergarten year instead we're sitting kitchen table working curriculum cobbled together. know different, *I* remember age fun big kid school first time. Hahahah look map - desert major cities, Perth. I'm worried one hidden driver increases cold weather forcing people interact indoors.

We hear much discussion HVAC systems may contribute spread Covid. FHM invalid reporting/corrections, one Sweden's 21 regions corrected numbers. chance world, nah. Good point. Ontario government okay. They've made mistakes, governments since tough situation. 

I referring people Ontario. There've lots fines businesses individuals breaking rules. even people protesting outside premier's house throwing fake blood ground, terrible. vote man particularly like premier I'm honest, there's need dick ffs.  learn Batman movie, nobody care put mask. Wear mask lifted obscurity! feel wind face reminder? G r e Agreed!  Thanks! Everyone different data point still stands, verge another uptick entering coldest months season. 
 
Thanks alternative data. last time terrorist attack happened American soil (white American guys guns included)? mean measures working? know need anymore? honestly expect remove security airports one day?

I'm comparing 9-11 this. I'm comparing measures brought 9-11 measures brought coronavirus. There's difference. I'm even saying measures effective (I write news outlets) I'm saying they're going away. like masks, like track trace. Mood Propaganda Definitely, think good leader gives believe skilled specialty efficacy guide create positive change, defer those. leader cannot expert fields must respect allow power influence distributed. Educators, scientists, greater populace (etc.) Must given voice, someone wise enough use position elevate voices others deserves leader.

For many reasons, FDR favorite president. overlook try hide greatest failing allowing Japanese internment camps exist, presidents legacy US full atrocity culpability, actions policy stand out. public works programs investment lives US citizens really incredible comparison rest presidents. Meeting exceeding principles actions (imho) necessary reach future egalitarian, equitable, greater sense wellbeing.

Not watering Japanese internment camps though, really know much I'd greatly encourage read it. Thanks much, I'm sorry too. Dolly amazing. people “surprises” anti mask morons. Also government free care causing many deaths, meanwhile make joke one person govt covid dying get instant ban Ok Comrades making stuff up, then?

If younwant real example pressure put FDA this, look Trump's tweets telling approve vaccine election. course, care that, you? Great, something increase availability filtering facepiece respirators risk population.

That's way going fix legacy, lady. Good point - cases yes. deaths followed. Deaths per capita Germany still among lowest EU. currently two pandemics going - COVID-19, assholery. Well, I'm doctor take everything say grain salt.

Being fat-soluble, means excess vitamin stored within fat cells body. keep taking large amounts time, body releasing more. 

Vitamin C hand supplement *water* soluble. excess C released urine. quite literally impossible overdose C. said recommend trying still make cramp.

At least that's understanding. Anyone education, feel free correct me. BSL-4. 

Still one wants accept possibility. 

Ignorance.. mask nose like say “wearing mask like makes nose like gigantic!” 👃 thin silver lining current surge infections give quicker statistically confident estimate real-world vaccine effectiveness. can't wait hear results. worldometers:

04/27 1 million 

06/07 2 million (41)

07/05 3 million (28)

07/21 4 million (16)

10/27 9 million (16) Federal laws supersede state local laws. Millions people dead official federal plan, yet get banned talking political solution. mean Johnson?

AFAIK locked several council areas North areas (e.g., Liverpool, Manchester Nottingham) indeed witnessing plateau decrease cases. people can't handle staying home already none it. lot people never going part. Best wishes you. **China loses trust internationally coronavirus handling** 

What else expect western media make lies China accountability lol?

“Repeat lie often enough becomes truth.”

People believe Uyghur genocide, virus leaked etc different people believe earth flat, 5G corona, Bill Gates microchip.

""It's easier fool people convince fooled."" COVID-19 March. also diabetic asthmatic. Post COVID-19 still affecting diabetes. Readings mostly control. COVID-19 great job managing blood sugar readings. already Dexcom G6 also ordered T-Slim pump. two coordinate together definitely help out.

I also dealing muscle spasms occasionally weakness legs struggle walking standing. fell shower hours ago. bad timing. also PTSD cause could post COVID-19. thankfully hit head anything I'm worried concussion.

COVID-19 definitely affected health I'm still dealing months after. fun. Mask people global pandemuc! fly recently thing. N95 + goggles (with vent.) Wiped seats used hand sanitizer touching anything. booked First Class Alaska since leave seat next empty, plus get 3 overhead air vents planes that.

I also didn’t drink much water hours flight wouldn’t go bathroom.

And also got double-sided medical tape stick edges mask face tightly possible.

I assumed air around swimming COVID particles, also burned clothes got destination (lol kidding, put corner rest days handling put laundry.) Misanthropes Unite! Hey heard idiot banging goblet drums Wash Park Ritchie Center? That's me. Lockdowns meant buy time, unless really contain it, feasible pandemic modern world.

That said, everything else done wrong Eating face... Oh ... I’ve seen them.

(I’m normally like actors it’s *stephen amell*) seeing Individualism dominant paradigm near future 

In America least, already increasing scrutiny limits individualism even Covid. lot debate surrounding healthcare reform medicare-for-all precisely that. Freedom liberty absolutely responsibility. anyone ever spent time Wisconsin, much surprise. Certain governors never one now. guess everyone remembers bad May August southern hemisphere, winter. South Africa, Peru, Chile, Brazil Colombia especially. yet can't remember last time mass killing occured perpetrated white guy home nation... Looking natural cycles flu seasonal coronaviruses, even November, nowhere near peak. R value rise every year see whether measurements counter that. shit know you’re probably invited lot parties. graduated college one step time. lot politicians Europe seem ignoring that. Thinking small things places must stopped spread hard lockdown. keep pushing past wars

Buddy, war Iraq less 20 years ago.

I want go victim poor nation tell ""was past"".

You're complete psycho. Australia limbo vaccine comes lockdowns authoritative levels every time minor outbreak. This. It’s big deal either/or (I’m aware it’s probably not...), you’re gonna go non-profit. timing EU shows *not* schools. EU year-round school. T-cell responses produce sterilizing immunity. CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells kill already infected cells, neutralize virus like neutralizing antibodies B-cells. people immune responses 17 years later likely could easily reinfected. disease would likely less severe due T-cells, nothing study contradicts information linked article above. *is* irrational. Narcissists/sociopaths/psychopaths mentally deluded makes sense Correct! ""Long Covid"" real medical condition ""feeling unwell"". handing hypochondriacs blank slate invent conditions. Southwest blocking middle seats. read said baseless, presumptuous bullshit. ever say claim would “push demand blanket restrictions government”? live fear? Get fucked man, people like make much worse. super fair skin...crazy history sun based skin cancer family...I live cal. sun time...I still don’t high levels vitamin d. low end acceptable unless supplement. People get checked. It’s fat soluble vitamin that’s it’s stored iirc. took 3 months get back normal range vitamin iron levels extremely bad ovarian cyst ruptures loss blood, plus low like every vitamin. also take magnesium, niacin, B vitamins prescriptions too. dose vitamin lot lower. comparing Denmark Norway example, multiple press briefings week politicians trying instill importance following new recommentations, I'd say yes still sustainable sense people generally know what's expected long time ahead. baseline changed behavior put hope 2 weeks long changes bar opening times going 2 10 5 20 people allowed group. ex swimmer I'm fucking devastated reading shortage nurses willing treated like dirt, actual shortage trained people. barely test anyone reinfections (needs genomic sequencing strain prove reinfection). might tons tons reinfections simply can't prove. Thank much explaining! comment highlighted exactly part comment talking about... even said word twice pointing word seems unduly optimistic given data.

You said data ""might indicate beginning plateau"", pointed absolutely *nothing* data indicates sign plateau.

I see previous comment talking expected, idea expected... never said anything expected.

I talking said saw current data. Nothing more. know correction flagged already last week? half passengers shut eyes say isnt happening... Honestly, understand people. NEVER WAY! happened comradery wishing best every country? Great Finland good, wonderful - trying achieve comments?  videos I’ve seen PBS show relative effectiveness even simple cloth masks. profile shots expectoration taken sort polarizing light (or something like that) makes airborne clouds particles clear. see masks cut distance. Now, still wouldn’t want room someone coughing, indicate, longer stay chances contact. simple masks helpful option, I’d rather one not. Better masks better availability (along mandate) would be... better. 

I agree CDC, considering political
meddling shouldn’t surprised. acquaintances government agencies, stories I’ve heard blatant destruction mounds records data -that taken lifetimes collect- contradicts administration narratives is, word, frightening. Hand hand suppression dissemination relevant information tactics intimidation. guys far right nazis through. What's know. government wants put teachers danger - something that's already happened areas weaker unions - union it. 

I'm shocked - shocked - post /r/conservative. almost like ideologically opposed strong unions. times history cities instituted level quarantine lockdown.  Issue prominent outbreaks yersinia pestis (most commonly spread rats fleas) cholera (drinking water contamination), good way evaluate effectiveness one way since human human spread transmission method.

Edit: Totally forgot Spanish Flu. results St. Louis lockdown versus Philadelphia staying open prominent one. St. Louis fewer deaths generally considered recovered faster economically. Lots articles time economy tanking whether open lockdown, there's that. Never gonna happen. two biggest provinces , Ontario Quebec populations Pennsylvania Michigan together. vast majority cases deaths. 

Ontario 200 cases per million Quebec 600 (Same US overall). pandemic choices. Masks, distancing isolation solution vaccine 2-4 months. Ecuador, we're middle: strict lockdown, gradual lifting, rate spike go away. ICU brink collapse, never worse, simmer along 800-1000 cases day. hope agile enough see next spike coming early enough respond. And, hope early measures taken swiftly could possible less harsh. find relationship vitamin D
concentrations vitamin deficiency severity disease. higher increases it’s quite sweeping argument. higher increases tested ten times less didn’t report four days total weekends. It’s alarming increase expected you. You’re usually better statistics (but maybe context).  problem uncritical deployment concept ""lockdown"" rather efficacy broad range strategies describes Yup, hope sarcasm came basically got downvoted quoting article.

I think limited immunity going disappointing lot people going take time accept. know hard me, I'm fast adapter. People push back accept coronavirus chicken pox. nightmare really, vaccine becomes close 100% effective. showed them. still observing first stay home order. Wait, mean could left home last six months? would matter. starting look like Tom Hanks Castaway. ""Evil, think, absence empathy.""

_Captain G. M. Gilbert, Army psychologist assigned watching defendants Nuremberg trials_ 18% usual March-June. Sweden better job reporting deaths many European countries (UK Spain particular). Ya say  find relationship vitamin concentrations vitamin deficiency severity disease.  Incivility

Are kidding me? 95% confidence interval data probably uselessly wide. still data, however. get ~~lockdowns~~ ""totally lockdown"" *recommendations* stay inside Malmö too.  weird. Tegnellists kept saying 8 months lockdowns work. FHM wants ~~lockdowns~~ *recommendations* stay inside.

&amp;#x200B;

Where see ""stay inside"" ??? Unsure, certainly people sure they're try ensure immune system functioning peak. Vitamins C D, Zinc, Selenium important immune function. I'm sure others. mean - there's difference diarrhea, cleaning yourself, going swimming vs. shitting pool. Reading above, mental image people crapping pool even though know that's case. links disprove help CA numbers?

I read interview process, people unable identify may exposed; however, identify possible exposure sites, 55% said attended event gathering two people became sick, 17% said attended place worship people became sick. 3,000 people tested positive COVID-19 spent time retail setting, like grocery store shop. 1,400 people spent time outdoor spaces, 600 people visited restaurants 500 people offices.

I'm trouble finding specific area talking 4% schools though. calculate mentioned somewhere else? hardly consider happened March lockdown. least comparing countries done it. what's latest regards runny nose covid? know used say really symptom. boyfriend one today wondered beginning it. Slight headache too. fever. Considering attitude pandemic masks general, practically impossible generate sympathy cucks. doesn’t matter, Jesus.

Even 15-20% it, you’d still seen shit ton re-infections here. states reporting negative number cases. Thinking unnecessary precursor it. think necessary, (even people think unnecessary also it). least, perfectly reasonable say group **containing** people refuse wear masks demonstrates antisocial tendencies. latest news even get shot, we're still masked distancing least 2022...maybe 2023. Maybe forever. least that's Osterholm company say. No, Niljs Bejerot reptilian alien. I'm sorry wrong makes angry, that's childish. mature thing change mind wrong, throw fit stigmatize mentally ill, marginalized group. Extremely poor behavior. Giesecke *is* pulling strings, miss FHM leaks trying misinform readers.


Saying powerful people influence politics least controversial thing ever. That's case every country. example nobody accusing Russia critics ""conspiracies"". know happened doctors fell windows Russia. know Sweden's regressive corona policy constant government misinformation result science. I'm raising legitimate question. *actually* happened Sweden. 

No. Nobody said cultural support mask denial. example leading social democrat politician forgot ministerial governance second claimed ""masks part Swedish culture"". think Swedish vanity also explains it. need everyone get vaccinated get control. Hopefully least 40% us smart enough get it. amazing many people get flu vaccine, people make huge difference keeping control. That's reason many say ""I've never gotten flu vaccine I've never gotten flu"". You’re comparing apples oranges here. I’m defending US response, Canada like 9x less amount people US does. Definitely gives edge controlling cases national level.

We shouldn’t saying “look Canada, that’s America wear masks” saying “wow look evidence proves wear masks” really 2nd increases yet local areas? know state levels we've seen it, seen info specific areas. What’s practical difference third surge first wave vs third wave? frustrating.....on one hand fellow Coloradans die, hand, many us need work eat.... Well. Everyone agrees lockdowns sustainable. 

They use little bursts dormant periods between—like Israel showed

Argentina failing people stopped respecting lockdown long run problem people completely vaccination. hear numerous arguments like ""new fascism"" ""companies trying control us"" etc. think scientists experts naive thinking take better education people here... mean Czech people absolutely completely rational arguments resistance face. strict deadline. countries limits avoid situations like Britain someone tested positive march, died car accident June counted covid death cook nice ""Schweinsbraten"" (pork roast) it, fine that. :D concerning went days ago, still board idea testing matters? 

Of course matters... saying compare known numbers (the reported numbers) imaginary numbers invent account difference testing.

Yes, twice many tests week June 24 (the previous high) way knowing real number might be. know, tested everyone actually infected thus reported number *is* real number.

Likewise, know, despite testing twice many people last week, might tested anywhere near total number people actually infected. fact assume not, obviously infected people spreading virus people unknowingly (I would hope).

So, end, compare reported Feels like common knowledge now, reason like make things seem worst possible way. 

No, try stick facts. facts **reported** cases time before. Anything else guess.

One thing... positive rate week 26 (the week containing previous single day high) 10.18% - positive rate week 42 3.86% - that's big difference. US also want shit every opportunity Seeing country voted flagrant, gawdy 1%er country since gilded age, member party tax cuts wealthy…

Yes, think that's exactly stretch. response got auto-removed.

Fortunately small part big family! ignoring second parallel statistic told about? know ignorant, reading threads months. satisfy desire :

FHM statistic counts everyone dies within 30 days confirmed positive COVID-19 (""recently positive""). also makes checks death registry ensure that. means recently positive got hit car - counted in. recently positive stage IV terminal cancer die now, counted in. recently positive unrelated condition results deaths - hospital - counted in. untested die COVID-19, counted statistic also tested die month last positive test. Keep mind, people hospital tested too?

Socialstyrelsen statistic counts everyone death certificate COVID-19 main secondary cause death contributing factor. also includes people diagnosed COVID-19 doctor tested. However, exclude people died causes COVID-19 positive - example cancer patient traffic accident removed here. find data here: ; 90% cases found statistic test results FHM, two statistics largely overlap.

Edit: also, people refer statistics Sweden one countries excess deaths causes collaborate officially reported COVID-19 death numbers. find here: boat. Got single check get unemployment state moved cross country live family member cancer. arrived state around February 15th. Started job hunt immediately world fell shit. feel safe taking job person I'm dying remote position. I've already burned IRA's cash UGMA account pay bills. entire life's savings gone. I've lost pretty much hope future. “Limited.” Yea that’s figured based particle size, suppose even far exact science would known distance earlier. wait 2 months. really dismissive people seriously affected lockdowns. 

This really dismissive people died/will die CoViD-19 White collar childless 40 year old. confirm. first, many, winters I'm going snowbird. Werent lot hospital staff laid let go ? Coloradan confirm. never cold freaking October. kind numbers come late December Early January means protecting human beings. yes, want wear mask Big events taking place like back Feb/March,

Trump rally's. Enough said Meh play stupid games Win stupid prizes

Zero empathy sympathy racist Trump supporting hilljacks

Let choke Holy false analogies, Batman. Jesus... disingenuous say Strategy works seems work one country another. That's raise question whether wrong looking right thing. Like Australia New Thank much. saw woke warmed heart. really nice read, appreciate took time so.

**Thank do!**

As me, I’m final semester I’m excited get started RN, wow, weird time transitioning careers. Trump could used virus pummel China.  

He could blamed entire global pandemic. 

Imagine simple Trump speech: 

""China knew new virus kept hidden, could limited travel country instead lied kept hidden. honest world would rallied around China, could dodged huge bullet. Chinese lied deliberately caused global pandemic. Every death outside China responsibility Chinese government rest world hold China accountable.""   

Then Trump puts mask slashed circle Chinese flag followers would dancing.   

Trump hands pandemic handling CDC, Trump goes around whipping anti-China platform.  lock-downs, fault Chinese, anyone died Chinese fault. enough masks Chinese ship them.  

The CDC would contained virus, Trump would hailed hero Democrats handing control virus response experts Republicans hammering China. 

Trump would reelected landslide, possibly getting 50 states. arguing semantics context, contributing meaningfully discourse. literally said lifestyle we're looking for. want someone likely contract virus myself.  Thats big tobacco government I'm shocked. could've expected can't speculate whether true, here's argument made time: Protests reduced rates replaced riskier behavior. Marching doors less vector protesters would otherwise doing, blocking traffic, reduced risky behavior non-participants. Again...I'm merely conveying argument heard, weighing value. Covid indirect cause death. 
Look battle Stalingrad WWII. Tens thousands civilians died starvation illness since couldn’t leave city. include deaths total battle since indirect result battle. yeah right Ikr? bunch great books like Garrett’s “The Coming Plague” Preston’s “The Hot Zone” bestseller lists ***back 90s*** warning us this. 

I read dozen others. word novel respiratory virus epidemic China made news, got attention. then, like nightmare horror movie, watched wave soar approach shores sign responsible grownups charge anything except bungling — shit, fucked. 😣 Yeah, I've heard many times Sweden best strategy sustainable.

Is sustainable anymore? Yes, remember, though exact number, people Covid majority ICU. though exactly complications covid rather admitted something else diagnosed positive. also remember ICU places full nationwide point quite possible indeed 1000 Luckily 7 digits available Excel sheet suffice. Depending lives LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics, lab might able tests without doctor’s order. downside insurance won’t cover cost. Google: walk lab &lt;his good news Soeder made strong statement today (from understood, yet speak German well Bayerisch accent easy haha). Usually, Corona, states follow less Bayern does.

I expect full lockdown announced tomorrow night summit. Please explain instead vague We're going exceeding alot milestones cases winter. Selfishness. Surprising. count people know wear mask well? Like nose chin? I'm sure follow logic here. Yes population smaller, tail first wave hits rural America like truck *lot* people backwoods, together place.

If Thanksgiving Christmas ends mini-super-spreader event every small town American, it'll catastrophic. .1% total population tests positive one day. crazy. Hmm. sound like? I'm agreeing lol. literally offer mask first refuse service refuse wear pull shit. Found one! I'll shoot children full anything government gives say it'll help protect covid interesting academic exercise consider pandemics normalized context, I'm sure that's interesting public policy perspective....you play hand dealt. sanitation medical care, population density connected world still justify letting people die countries older populations mind letting people get otherwise preventable damage ethical code.

What justified letting 60,000+ people die US '17/18 flu season? lockdown-resistant population be. Who?  article.

We here. Agreed. mom two autoimmune diseases, Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriasis. got tested negative Covid week half. read may attack body rest life (which, way, basically Rheumatoid Arthritis -- body attacks itself). Terrifying shit man Pfizer clearly working rule understood. entirely certain would different outcome rule changed im saying they're encouraged leverage they'll first get bailed out. bad math.

The population US 350 odd million.

You said 99.6% survival rate.

That leaves 0.4% 350 million.

That's 1.4 million.


By figure, over, 1.4 million Americans dead it.

That's counting reinfection happening increasing regularity now.


My advice? Stop contradicting experts start paying attention, smart enough find loophole pandemic. “Being dick linked dick, study finds.”  countless lives saved. different? Honestly still college happened would taken break year. point trying. Especially lab heavy majors. believe COVID mid-March house buying trip Las Vegas crowded area later revealed known case (funny pilot also caught Las Vegas), could get tested Salt Lake City lived time hadn’t China Italy weren’t testing much early. symptoms subject article talks about. walk 6 year old week half ago suddenly started dripping sweat, felt faint, elevated heart rate, almost sit thought might able stand. headaches, muscle aches, fatigue time never get enough sleep. never tested positive COVID it’s really hard taken seriously. feel guy. week 66 teachers 150 students quarantined. 


Shhhh.. 'normal!'


At least kids 'fall behind'. Everyone quarrantining everytime normal cold, cough, allergies, etc... make sure Covid-19. think make sense grocery stores, planes, indoor situations. don’t agree outdoors also think make social educational interactions much worse. Conform mentally ill

Pretty old tactic really  [The US right  Testing positive cases yes. Death rate still 1/2 ath rising though. lol imagine actually believing bedtime story, cratered skull topic, defending experience person attacking experience. discussing opinions, discuss opinions.

Fair enough. worth, agree ""experience"" supreme court judge. wanted snooty, could even say credentials average. fundamentally disagree credentialism that's led supreme court justices recent history chosen Harvard Yale, that's entirely different argument. science shows children extremely low risk. fact, higher risk dying flu children die flu 3 months every year died coronavirus since pandemic began 7 months ago. There's reason can't get kids back school capacity proper precautions controls.

Yes, everything I've read, that's correct. Children much less likely die coronavirus practically group. 

I issues line thinking though. 

1) Covid's long term health affects? I'm virologist, study science, much less medicine. I'm going pretend know much I've read news articles exactly reliable source, sounds like significant proportion people get covid longterm side-effects ranging breathing difficulties mental slowing. Even risk death low, long-term effects need considered. 

2) completely ignoring teachers &amp; families. 

3) school underserved they're less likely proper precautions controls mitigate risks. 

4) families children higher risk themselves. Even students die, one bad outbreak school could mean dozens high risk people getting infected. again, school underserved likely getting best anti-Covid equipment is. 

I hear saying. went high school 1/3rd class graduate, Obama years. I'm certain teachers proper protection right now. I'm aware issues bringing I've seen families internet, kids shuffled around family member family member, parental figures make go school. I'm fine leaving behind, concerned teachers well. wrong tell risk lives government give shit kids. all, government cared, something would've done months ago. they'd passing another stimulus bill right provisions ensure everyone internet access. they'd anything putting Amy Coney Barrett court. 

If want blame someone, blame elected officials. could something. Pelosi, McConnell, Trump could've gotten together said ""Look, there's lot teachers students risk. follow science, find what's best, ensure everyone protected be."" that's happened they're bloodsucking ghouls. They're reason I'm supportive unions - unions way average person exercise power society. I'm sure Lori Lightfoot going bend issues. Imagine nationwide. Imagine nationwide teachers strike right demanding proper protection, assured internet access students, meals too. bet they'd acting right now. Instead, there's pressure them, won't. truly together. typo? 100iu little. lifeguards trying best they’re bit overwhelmed vast volumes people drowning shit. Apparently drowning shit news bad pool’s concession sales. pool admins blaming lifeguards reporting drownings blowing whistle warn dangerous conditions.  
 
Also, pool patrons made death threats pool cleaner advising temporary closure pool cleaning measuring escalating coliform count pool. Apparently pool admins think didn’t measure amount shit pool wouldn’t there. Ignorance bliss till drown shit you’ve spewing. 600% standard (one tiny gelcap’ worth) dosage supplements. Eight times much day months may lead toxicity.

It toxicity, though. adverse effects even reach level outright toxicity. I’m this, make tests free mandatory covered insurance. insurance cover tests symptoms you’re getting test travel purposes it’s $160 test. feels like another restriction heavily effects prohibits poor. welcome congratulations! Nursing school one hell ride default, let alone unprecedented global health crisis.


Stay safe, comrade. Anti mask, anti vax, anti facts multivitamins? No, people hospitalized likely deficient. Significant difference. Europe reopened schools thinking would safe. They've shown otherwise. Kids might get sick often spread. absolutely ridiculous argument. Much science identifying trends order understand phenomena better -- case, phenomenon non-compliance public safety protocols. personality differences (on average) comply, valuable information public health perspective.

What suggesting throw entire field social science.  see long took vaccines made assume case one, yet ignore context one developed lot different. Greatly improved understanding virology, decades preliminary research SARS MERS, fact respiratory virus thats spreading quickly across globe. Compare last headline worthy epidemic, ebola, limited small region world part, spread orofecally. pretty simple.

Trump saying reason positive cases we're testing more.

The data shows infection *rate* largely static since beginning (3-5%). 

So beginning tested 100 symptomatic people we'd expect see 3-5 positive tests COVID.

Now covid everywhere (again, wholly Trump leadership) he's saying cases we're testing tens thousands people day, meaning we're seeing thousands positive cases.

Trump also, erroneously, points CDC IFR data recently states survival rate anyone 70 essentially guarantee likely die due car wreck working class (less 70 years old) covid.

We need combat narrative costs Lol came one call vocal minority. everywhere spreading misery. news articles comments YouTube video comments calling radio shows counter protesting protests human rights. anyone know kids 10 schools Europe required wear masks outside recess? Seriously, government never seems want deal reality, regardless party level. knew would spike cases fall, invest shitloads money testing infrastructure? bullshit Canada too. conducted mass testing, much people would self isolate positive tests virus would slow massively. money spent testing would saved less money spent patient care. think part sensationalism journalism. Someone likely read article says immunity falling fast, scientist saying antibodies declining (as do) infection. Journalist take statements studies turn something sensational. recent study University Arizona that's called Let's Stick Known Knowns, think decent take immunity. so, name study, think jab sensationalism immunity. testing 

Better protocols

Hospitals overloaded ( except changing ) Look up. I'm right. suck though. Trying send money family untendered \~1 billion contract buddies another untendered contract mask production name urgency 'pandemic.' Can't wait probe begin see many decisions made political interests versus health concerns. see you’ve given arguing points given irrefutable evidence you’re wrong. That’s great. 

Now, protecting healthcare system, sure. It’s overloaded. reason don’t want overload again? Could be... preventing even people dying? Sweden failed utterly compared Norway? Maybe offer help condition hangs plastic wears mask outright stops. seem like awesome sub see often hear. People saying anyone working care dooming rest it. really people keep working live. Pandemic pandemic. wouldnt fair us go one

Well, everyone what's best given circumstances. Everyone going pleased regardless, I'm trying remind people alternatives ""cancelling"" holidays. ... Cases Covid reported less frequently among participants Pfizer study US whole. .. study progressing slowly ... originally expected. 
Their COVID-19 vaccine likely first efficacy data. first analysis come total 32 cases COVID-19 across company's entire 42,000 volunteer study. would considered positive six fewer 32 cases occurred group received vaccine. .. trial expected continue 150 volunteers COVID-19. Vitamin cheap, D3 animals D2 plants, highly effective safe consume matter kind diet follow. Someone infectious touches mouth. touch something later touch. agree Epidemiologist Jay Varkey, MD, Emerson: ""Optimism breeds complacency."" fun Cattle would quarantined herds. Apparently cattle havev dollar value. 2 month rule publicly revealed 10/6, tell someone deals FDA, gave private guidance expectations companies probably June July. 

Also seem ignoring fact per Pfizer’s call today don’t even enough events file. 

They anticipating enough data mid November actually 60 day rule would expire. generalize people based traits group per definition share connection group. matter wearing mask skin color. Thank you, Tavern League! that’s takes, Sounds good Ahahahahahabanabababababbhhabbbaaaaaahbababa duh!!! would put MONEY majority repugnicunts young healthy, comply government protect not!! 0 problems maintaining social connections contacts throughout this.

Because beforehand? reanimation...  Since April apparently, twice daily number October 20. ""muh medical freedom infect take others me!"" lot doodies. That's mind made comment. Using timeline, think April 2021 telling whole situation. appears we're month two away average person getting vax, may get people buy restrictions little longer. vaccine available average person point (hopefully that's case), compliance stop epidemiological end might correspond social end. point, we're still long way average person getting vax, social distancing least end vast majority population epidemological end arrive, pain interim. make educated guess, that's think rest pandemic go. Yes, US failed local, state, national level. believe it. Anti maskers “exempt “ people come store always act like wanna square Virus cant replicate cycles meaning essentially unspreadable levels. big kicker testing centers testing 40-45 cycles. Meaning catching positives thats already dead viral cells small amounts possible spread. 

So begins question % positive tests greater 32 cycle count essentially meaningless numbers? Yeah mean c’mon, New York comes close testing number.  Well heard don’t use it, lose it. Let clear. I’m saying it’s obviously productive respectfully offer somebody mask aggressive, call names, write asshole. apply mentality anti-maskers. It’s better kind sticking guns try brute force somebody way thinking. It’s called tact. might wrong people assholes, there’s productive way things, unproductive way things. Yea, don’t asshole wear fucking mask. western nations calling currently value human rights highly. think China Saudi Arabia value more, lost mind. Gonna take least six eight months, say, time hundreds thousands us killed, without ongoing strong mitigation efforts.  thinks restrictions Poland put place terrible useless

The problem restrictions Poland cherry-picked science based. Back April/May really outbreaks, super strict lockdown measures. allowed leave house non-essential reason. required wear face mask even car. pretty much lifted restrictions.

Comparing I'm Seattle, never strict lockdown Poland, time regulations relaxed since April. We're much better Poland. pace we're going hit 90k cases single day Friday potentially 100k next week two. Oxford’s absolutely made profit basis. terms trust think it’s positive 100% relevant, far less pressure vaccine.  Mitch mcconnell adjourned Congress til election. expect help... Lol ok pal. 

I 0 problems maintaining social connections contacts throughout this.

I can’t see loved ones friends they’re hospital dead.

Good luck sir! Fair still one step complicated process. vaccine available everyone next year. Masks social distancing still needed 2022. Remember: end pandemic. Stay safe CDC says otherwise. Mask wearing shopping cart experiment applied global scale, anyone fails dregs society. Regarding Kiwi here. really got best history predicting Swedish peaks mid april peak spot on.

Here kiwi claiming drop Sweden fiddling belief Swedish government began fiddling figures ... suspect we'll see many reports days month ago increase, wiping supposed drop number Lmaoo “Recovered”. 

It interesting see test scores improve years, diet / lifestyle / continuing treatment move needle long term. paragraph two later, local businesses mentioned, too: ""Eine unrühmliche Rolle spielten auch die Firmen im Dorf. Es gebe Hinweise, dass einzelne Firmen die Mitarbeiter ermuntert hätten, sich nicht beim Kanton zu melden, um grössere Ausfälle zu vermeiden, ..."" Exactly. we're testing 10x many people (from, say, April May) % positive tests results stayed largely consistent (3-5%) mean overall higher number positive cases.

We need learn beat drum second nature. Trump going use tactic try kill Americans

Your life may stake main point make sure nutritional deficiencies wear damn mask add they're looking potential EUA 3rd week Nov. Nov 25 also previously reported. mean available date, approval could come relatively shortly that. again, drama something eventually disappear. You’re acting like end world fact temporary inconvenience. sons school closed 2021. He’s 9 mentioned killing himself. 9 year old!!!!! Perfectly fucking normal 9 year old January yet are. studies conclusion ""25OHD levels lower hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared population-based controls patients higher prevalence deficiency. **We find relationship vitamin concentrations vitamin deficiency severity disease.** ""  that’s motorcyclists usually obnoxious, selfish assholes!

Sigh. surprised, seems like humanity approx 8 months worth fortitude deal pandemic. Montana, schools going back five days week elementary schools. county cases 100 day.  Colombia maybe, another surge now. far Ireland I'm told worsening situation due testing, test sensitive, there's false positives, test asymptomatic cases never infectious. get tested. increase COVID-19 cases admitted hospital real, people went e.g. broken leg got diagnosed virus. uncle, aunt, father, neighbor 2 days dying Alzheimer's Cancer Fell Over, COVID-19 put death cert cause death even though family objected doctor so. die Covid Covid? conducted 7 autopsies far Covid cases. 

And wear mask, useless, like wearing nappy, God give mask? Immunity wears month virus, vaccines can't ever work. need fear virus. friends virus, go party virus, let young catch it. 

And all, need open pubs. 

I think I've covered everything. running average peak coincides well introduction last Tuesday important read headline

From studies conclusion:

""25OHD levels lower hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared population-based controls patients higher prevalence deficiency. **We find relationship vitamin concentrations vitamin deficiency severity disease.** "" didn’t need anymore proof sports fans stupid... Data provided done per capita ""We're morally good mentally sound,"" says group people cheer police arresting people social media posts wearing mask outdoors. Yup right. I'm sorry. read first block jumped conclusions. I've sleeping like ass half assing things, that's excuse take downvote previous comment btw I'm even sure people did.

I reckon people think they'll get flu ok, instead thinking vulnerable get die. potential put huge debt maybe enough. *pretends shocked* Oh great, make retarded. Yeah I’m never within 6 feet anyone outside don’t wear one unless I’m store. I’ve work office ~25 people whole time nobody wears mask unless we’re meeting clients. hardly ever leave desk anyway. sort wish wear them, don’t want person don’t care much getting it, so... yeah, feel you. hit save mistake? failed properly respond comment.

Like bureaucrat. Tegnell say what's good career. Russian doctors fall windows mistake. Criticizing Russia ""conspiracy"". Strange things happen probably corruption. like Sweden. like elderly care bosses locked safety equipment save money.

Maybe FHM got completely wrong start proud cowardly admit it. Maybe someone tipped ""the economy important"" that's little late. Maybe both. 

Maybe someone tipped Löfven social democrats. clean. Maybe that's act time. FHM. clear science only. think driven frustration many people refuse take seriously someone knows dies get sick, agree, justify hoping people get infected slightest perpetuate damaging us vs. mentality. might coincidence, people Europe America Vitamin deficiency anyway. said, take C every single day I’m still alive. Band aid? RIP damn cast, fast. Well duh  Actually poured glass water mask, less water would hit face/mouth water absorbed fabric due capillary effect. Especially multi layered mask. wore mask dumped glass water face would somewhat drier dumped glass water bare face. That’s also common sense.

Edit: sorry fascinated water comparison. wearing clothes rain? rain jacket? cloth mask like wearing clothes rain. Something like N95 would like wearing rain jacket. think tossing science window somehow makes opinion superior, you’ve got lot learn life. it’s true things like fungi thrive dark moist warm environments, cool things called disposable masks don’t wear weeks end day, reusable ones wash. wash clothes? Honestly wouldn’t surprised. freedom comes big price..good job! Chicago finally getting bit control unfortunately. starting feel like last major city managing keep thing control. suppose expected colder weather here. Scary stuff.

Some days gotta tell fuck off. Facts remain facts regardless palatable morons. I'm gonna alright. worried people money, space, freedom things like me. subsequent lockdowns winter, lots people going fall despair, lots people going resist.

I'd want government officials least kind fear under-performing employee feels go annual performance review boss Hi comrade! everyone Please, WEAR MASK NOSE. Exactly. 

I openly wonder many parents would done living pioneer times, medieval times. 

Maybe instead agitating sending kids back school parents work, parrnts agitate wages livable on, necessitates single parent **multiple jobs** two parents work long hours outside home. public health agencies contain it? work Spain. work, done lockdown ends.

See, wonderful thing locking [there comes rather quickly. PR seemed like unlocking portion middle seats let groups traveling together use. hope numbers based actual usage wishful thinking though. understanding following news mostly wedding guests wanted keep secret. linked article: ""Denn die Hochzeitsgäste hatten vereinbart, sich nicht testen zu lassen, um eine Quarantäne zu umgehen.""

There mention everyone village wanting keep secret. plenty villagers probably quite pissed participants. Would containment wrong choice word ? suspect France masking policy wrong enjoy 50k cases one day? 1/5 population mask requirement. going beat dead horse people aren’t wearing mask, guys like Fauci said don’t need everyone wear mask enough. Ohio particular we’ve masking requirement work since May masking requirement since July well closing bars early 10ish PM, crowd restrictions, yet cases going highest amount ever, hospital surge higher April peaks. us saying surge household gatherings IMO changed since summer, decreased increased. Obvious people aren’t wearing masks home requirements fits bill. Yet know wearing mask whenever company. means everyone selfish asshole account Atleast overwhelming majority are. never bought masks, see Atleast small preventative someone actually sick Atleast spreading germs onto surfaces coughing etc extent wearing mask do. makes sense, wearing mask public keep safe someone else never bought side. Hey now. I'm callous, hostile, deceitful, anti-social...but wear mask goddamnit. person using mental illness excuse politicize. believed. totally misunderstood post ok Sense superiority malignant narcissism &amp; psychopathy. know Native American population fraction Columbus arrived? Price gouging finest  Similar statements likely coming political leaders throughout country soon. hospitals critically short supplies February? Well saying, ""It's mask,"" last 6 months done anything change fact. Right. disagree initial flatten curve strategy (a two week shelter place order whatnot) bad take first step. 

The flatten-the-curve idea supposed lasted like 2 weeks yet still ongoing? Extending 7 month shutdown, however, now. 

The virus probably us rest time. first coronavirus block. think naive us think eradicate altogether. Thanks high obesity rate  Coincidentally, also happen 20% recorded Covid cases world too. Funny tracks... Finally found someone bothered read article. Planes safe folks. Go fly somewhere. elderly, chronically ill many obese people get enough time outside naturally make sufficient Vitamin D. Please make sure loved ones categories, take daily supplement. Nobody said alone. You’re 100% right one many things that’s wrong America right now. you’re rooting disaster, bad person. favorite reply ""Havent heard!? real!"" actually like wearing one, hope keep public even over. CDC tracks flu pneumonia deaths (not classified covid). year number flu pneumonia deaths extremely high (337,721 died Flu, Pneumonia and/or Covid). subtracting official CDC reported death counts caused covid-19 (code U07.1), left around 120,000 flu pneumonia deaths, far exceeds normal expectations. looking specific causes deaths, get better picture true total covid deaths (specifically zeroing excess flu pneumonia). Obviously, deaths related gun shots, accidents, drug abuse put different category. 

Similar methodologies used mexico well. Mexican public health experts reported ""atypically"" high amount pneumonia deaths previous years. example, May, Mexico reported double amount pneumonia deaths (not classified covid) normal. Experts said deaths likely due Covid given lack testing capabilities. 

Even though ""tough tell"" excess deaths alone, digging specific types deaths give experts clearer picture deaths caused Covid. larger, detailed study would needed, course, pandemic over. SARS-1 contained became pandemic 2003.

The difference SARS-1 caused much severe symptoms much quicker among infected ability stealthily spread asymptomatic mildly infected individuals may mistake symptoms cold allergies. thought RKI said restaurants bars **not** main driver infections instead private parties. Söder always wants strict measures Laschet less stricter. don´t forget kindergarten, distance rules made. slap face restaurants invested good concepts. Makes sense, thanks. still data, however.

Lol no, still works. Let happen. People areas want shutdowns. want make sure hospitals stay capacity (note: rural hospitals reaching capacity transferring patients hospitals ""overflowing""). 

If excess deaths occuring due lack medical care access, people areas never bothered care stopping COVID spread. tell otherwise? Fuck off, OP. Alright. You’re right I’m wrong I’m sorry. said question. it’s offensive call mental handicapped person r word, is, doesn’t open r word people? like working home. Hmmm. Yeah, two facts kind contrary... Projecting much? point, gives shit 9/11? We've reliving 9/11 every 3-4 days last half year nobody gives single shit people dying. 

We live world still reminisce heroic firefighters 9/11, time giving giant middle finger health professionals pandemic. fucking joke. news water wet... one good ones :-) “Survial” yes , wish anything bad happen naughty people get banned reddit breaking rules! Thanks! I’m notoriously bad simple things  first trip Paris - school trip age sixteen - involved lots Roma trying scam me, incredibly brusque service staff, metro carriage smelled like warm poop, kind sporting related riot, hardcore porn broadcast telly, getting pished 33cl cans Kronenburg teachers didn’t know allowed buy. see someone romantic view place would shocked realise it’s like Mos Eisley. waves particles ""You think I'm going let breathe MORE?"" Selfish people less social? wayy /s Every asset, including gold bitcoin, dropped March. Bonds safe.

I agree. Nothing safe, people piling stocks record rate pushing market record high P/Es. Bonds safe - proven out, interest rates fallen since then. Good luck. Misinformed not, number Republican governors senators stated circumstance allow another lockdown. 

What then? people infected, know infected? thanks. Getting bed definite challenge can’t true I’m things yet wear mask problem. South Dakota Governor *still* resisting masks downplaying COVID?! Even South Dakota currently one worst outbreaks nation?

What wrong Revenge Nerds. shop owner extension employees every right make enforce policies thoughts exactly. Remember, everything Fauci says calibrated get fired. 

I hope right. said, project management wheelhouse I'd shocked we're able get done then. Fancy think ignoring part reply maybe understand. funding Poland got allocated relief plan mainly put work support economy government calls ""anti crisis shield"". part healthcare mentioned plan tax advantages donations health care institutions. 

So yes plenty funding decisions made look future capacity hospitals potential second wave. hand, countries countries spent funding supporting economy essential workers. 

I believe know bit funding works, inhabitant Poland lively topic country variety reasons. wish doc would recommend fuck off.

These people deserve treatment, least ahead anyone actually gives shit science. today read 10 ... 20 % infections.

If get droplets eyes mask fit well, get infected. People … uneducated … wear mask.

It's breathing filters 50 - 95 % virus, less virus air spit people's eyes talking, spread share virus. Social media searches pretty standard part interview process lot jobs now. ""based saw social media feel appropriate fit company's goals values"" legitimate reason hire someone. use 7500IU well ZMA supplements daily, covid april, 3 weeks sneezing good. believe it. Still seems like house cards artificially propped federal reserve government me

There's non-zero chance. I'm gonna listen experts live results. black. Probably voting Turd. many 10 fingers? Give 24 hours, possibly second lockdown announced then. That's pretty clever. Selfish people free stuff. many people, morale decrease increase deaths increase fear increase cases hospital load, especially countries show certainty. chose path. People think right please anywhere; house open places required wear mask required enter private restricted area, choice enter comply. chose commit attempted murder could walked instead, people probably repeat offenders hope spend many years prison. Lol imagine get screened flu every time try travel real miracle still alive. think regional, especially consider European countries really size US states.

I think safe say New York would seeing second wave. love use reach draw conclusion based evidence reaching draw conclusion. Granted making reddit comment publishing irony hilarious. N95 masks make difference that? Back March 10th posted twitter feed story intensivist Bergamo, Italy, detailing hospitals experiencing kind triage patients forced do. also sent state reps, state epidemiologists, newspapers, etc.

After thing happened New York states spring, would think people would catch serious problem failure pay attention mitigation measures result hospitals overwhelmed people dying, covid-19, strokes, heart attacks, level potential care available deteriorates. 

But guess ""liberties"" wear mask social distance important. Crazy see things bad. following covid news. San Diego case numbers stayed crater low. sun shining, couples smiling walking, kids playing, birds chirping, mutherfuckers singing Kum Bah Yah streets. can't decide want sushi tacos dinner. Stay safe y'all realize fucking moron protected class lol

Are calling moron? person wrote said intend discriminate finding reason hire them.

That's really dumb legally actionable lot places. Nah bro, Florida's unemployment rate increasing again. New Zealand still open trade. borders closed incidental travelers. ports airports never closed trade export nation trade relatively unaffected. ""We learn history learn history."" hope reads bro issue government charge care death toll wants keep hold republic PM goes down, may end prison. government literally sacrificed thousands life political gain populist(s) charge see politics popularity contest, service population. top it, 1/3 voters totally supports it. talking about? .6% world population 47m people. statistic coming from? Kiss yo wife. Send yo kids school. Cause infecting everyone there. percentage populous vit deficiency? Isn’t also super high?  Jokes it. think get smaller haha posts misinformation especially dangerous misinformation stay up? thought that's reporting function for. legal otherwise responsibility people take care let alone anyone absolutely ethical responsibility actively spread deadly pathogen.

Big difference knowingly spreading virus mandated lock downs curtail freedom liberties everyone.

Quarantine sick people.

Lock downs healthy people. Fauci stated Vaccine widely available March/April, month 2 that, boom good.


Once vaccine approved, Production skyrocket countries pour money development. seems like safer bet assume Europe eventually fail containing COVID reopen US 

I'm European, no, likely might go another lockdown contain it. go back vaccine comes out. taking law hands, requesting customers follow rules place worked for. Asking people leave premises simply part job. certainly practical, still unnerving hospital employee work waiting test whose spouse already tested positive. Always been. _resting mask face_ No, they're new. use large storage capacity scares us. YES!! pick wives physical disabilities!!! specifically ride elevator day waiting wives physical disabilities.

Thank you! 

It's douchebag morons actually ask kindly go back get fucking mask ride elevator. them. specifically target wife physical disability. Thanks coming out! discrimination law would breaking hiring anti-masker? really can't stand nutjobs make laws whenever convenient. driving test thing honestly makes mad even read it. allowed shut services yet still require us use services daily life. allowed approved ""third party"" like parent something refuse offer pathway restrictions set up.  get vaccine, everyone get vaccine, I'm done wearing mask.

2 vaccines. probably going take 2 shots. probably going take months get done, although may smell normal next summer. dont get vaccine fuckin idiot

100% agreed. Many areas areas got hit hard got hit hard time year weather would considered bad took smaller hits periods time weather good.

If look Florida Georgia, appeared lots dumb things pandemic early without many losses expected then, weather became uncomfortable Florida Georgia's numbers surged weather comfortable general numbers look graphs individual states time notice much south got hit harder Summer north much north getting hit harder south. exceptions area successfully shut virus lucked enough population density arrive full force early states something particularly stupid. pretty much Evangelical relative resorted I--in moment weakness--got sucked discussing climate change.  logic easily shredded (because none) flustered fall-back was: ""Well, really matter End Times (tm) coming.""  


Nice, give shit world taking steps actually ""Conservative"" dying anyway. mindset angers greatly, kids hopefully living world many years come, believe sky-fairy horseshit. really care people believe it, except vote exactly way expect think world (or exactly, human society) would around long haul. Florida better step game up. way could if, somehow, someone interpret ""I want wear mask"" political statement.

It isn't. health one. here's thing - nobody recruiting ever going tell get hired. surprised suddenly decent employer hire you, never know why... supporting science. Or, too? "" Patients aged 20 70 years old hospitalized put ventilator help breathing saw thinking skills decline level person 10 years senior, **average**. ""

WOW... that's big deal. purpose articles business news biotech investors. They’re meant daily horse race potential end use consumer vaccine progress. works Try reading comment again. Things gotten worse since got rid restrictions. Sure, done well overall. I'm talking impact government restrictions. can't stop fucking airborne, contagious virus telling people wear cloth face mask. bring often. listen scientists, doctors God forbid catch covid, can't breathe admitted hospital they'll pray doctors save life..and question one thing doctors recommend treatment plan. Widely available? Nurses still reuse N95's two weeks  quit pandemic going back normal life.

Do it. made choice long time ago. feel like could considered things, wear mask. 

Seriously, fuck people don’t wear masks. sharing vaccine researches, point hypocrisy Israel everyone seems ok China something remotely similar would stealing. Every asset, including gold bitcoin, dropped March. Bonds safe.

You see buys bonds. They're owned banks, FED, financial institutions. used finance overnight lending. None holders reason sell them.

Yes, expect rise stay same, done 99% last crashes. Nobody said anything rising sharply. That's purpose portfolio topic discussion. Nothing like bible quote justify fact law rule.

I'm sure saying here, would rather live theocracy biblical based law prevails? available general public phase 3 trials completes. happens wife physical disability needs use elevator entitled prick preventing accessing it? 

I remember grade school bullies fucked disabled. go well bully.  agree you, white house absolutely nothing, we'd better place now. Instead kept feeding dumpster fire. amazing many people believe discrimination arbitrary denial opportunity like person opinions.

It's hardly arbitrary. kind selfish idiot would purposely endanger people avoid *minor* inconvenience type person many business owners interested hiring. stupid enough open kind legal liability hope successful business need assets pay settlement.

Zero legal liability zero chance needing pay settlements. Again, hiring selfish assholes illegal. ""Having stupid opinions"" protected class.  Requiring negative test enter countries border requiring quarantine doesn’t sound authoritarian, sounds logical. 50% cup water. ;) sincerely hope loved one becomes deathly ill Covid life threatening issue time, graciously give ICU bed hilljack d#mbfuck purposely made worse. prove saint are. impressive. Oh fucking god makes rage hard Wtf. idiot gotten wake-up call it. people stupid?! realize that, government since point decides something like round people like up, fault. 

Like seriously need wear mask use brains stay home instead they're acting like moronic children usually moronic children get punished. They're begging strict lockdowns shit. stupid understand that? That's wheelhouse apparently conspiracy bullshit government control seems life blood wtf. seems like miscommunication. Colorado time, too. state reported 2200 new cases days ago magically, dropped 1000 today. lockdowns. also one lowest testing rates Union.  *job* tell people wear face mask? Article Saturday Oct 24th btw, whoever else confused first  Same! Mine ""n"" key! 😂 I've said since beginning, patients, looking LOT like Lupus/autoimmune disease. Clotting (antiphospholipid antibodies tend go hand hand Lupus), 'covid toes' looked similar Vasculitis Raynauds, kidney issues, ground glass opacities lungs (similar Lupus Pneumonitis), IL-6 changes cytokine storm, neuropsychiatric effects, etc. knew could kick immune system hyperdrive, attacking body virus, rheumatic drugs least moderately helpful people. surprised all. Pretty shit natural selection.

It kills mostly old people already kids. live like game thrones schemers

die like game thrones schemers Agreed, unless aiming COVID zero, throwing everything early important. Gonna honest think needs be, statement fact. I’m American living abroad we’re laughing stock. Stay safe y’all. Lol okay? would really dumb lie. cold weather snap time last year! Let’s hope snowy winter! Hahahahahaha Even Russia instituted mask mandate now. country worst enemy. explains riots. 2 weeks flatten curve

To vaccine

From good working vaccine

To eradication. 

Get ready fight freedom doctors scientists stop playing god dont want spend rest days inside room rotting away laptop.

It didnt way.

This pandemic real unfortunately used tool grab power certain people world evil. backs I’ve always believed, everyone Dakotas antisocial, callous, hostile, deceitful. Easily worst thought click bait I've seen awhile, I'd thought YouTube ad. Victoria concerned me.

Suburb lockdowns 2nd July (50 cases/day), **massive** testing tracing campaigns affected.

Melbourne lockdown 7th July.

Mandatory face coverings 19th July.

Curfew tightened restrictions 2nd August.

And yet cases continued rise, peaking ~5th August, 700+/day.

They much Europe, yet kept going up. manageable long time hard measures began, presumably difference winter.

But there's light, cases negligible restrictions easing. excuse doctors pad stats get money hospitals  does. think like major city. France least great awesome public transit system, really easy get anywhere. personally prefer ""la France profonde"" city life.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* someone travels work every week, would fully support solid plan place. Would need get tested twice week (once Monday flight, Friday flight?) long would negative test valid for? Would quarantine test flight, contract two points?  say anything. asked question.

The bad science specifically obviously done good faith. done antibody test ""researchers"" [knew would test positive common though done scientists know better, there's calibration attempt account false positives. union protections. quit, receive unemployment could sued certain cases breach contract. Florida hostile toward teachers, hence put situation. Privately paid tests, require doctors prescription accounted number positive tests accounted total test number reason Singapore pretty well generally. atleast China isnt getting destroyed virus. west totally fucking destroyed over. Find companies approved test. **need** ""figure reason"". might *want* professional hire someone standard reasons 100% necessary. Football season started back hope stress what's causing recently expedited hair loss. get shingles back April May result stress. warm enough wear jackets go trick treating....

Not 17 degrees Fahrenheit Execpt, said, original reason absolutely legitimate. original person idiot looking another reason change fact violate anti-discrimination laws like watching every fucking stupid pandemic movie ever made. like they're playing part. Fucking idiots. Go watch 'Flu' see fuck-sticks planning. correct, mistake Also linked big dumb prick  goal change people's minds? feel important message left off. Why? would anyone want economic collapse? nefarious ones behind this? remain thoroughly unconvinced. Good day. Wishful thinking surprise happening again. seems like lot Western countries taking COVID seriously because, ""it's old people die."" Fucking sad terrible. didn’t say science didn’t backs wearing face masks. That's true. silver lining daughters (5 7 years old) slow-paced year play together half day. seen over-anxious second-grader relaxed long time. stand corrected, targeted, arbitrary discrimination.



Which, again, illegal what's targeted legally protected. anti-masker legally protected. There's absolutely nothing stopping someone hiring case need ""figure reason""

Well, need figure reason. hiring someone anti-masker illegal. Maybe want let snooping social media.  Like Saturday wear full face gas masks grocery. owned began, work. feel comfortable protected store. people get weirded though. anti maskers like stand near quietly stare eyes sheepishly look away. Dumb fuck. Imagine ruining several lives including own, right spread deadly virus. still havn't heard single proposed measure current situation you. lockdown. whats idea? Yeah lockdown wont stop COVID. delusional think that. would mean goes catastrophal state face overrun hospitals.

Sure virus handled well Western countries. due face current reality. huge outbreak again, controlled one way another really fucks shit up. measures SEA countries take lax measures Western countries take wont anymore. do? dont see another way curbing another Lockdown, perhaps get better control afterwards. alternative continue now, lead much harm (in death economic loss).

Come gimme least one thing think better lockdown. tried Postmates? friend made good money didn’t complain gps within it. also instacart. otherwise... i’ve ubers drive actually put like plexiglass driver back seats. could worth considering! uh macbook started this. able fix without sending repair? close parks/beaches/trails (at least county) start lockdown, could see people thinking critically drawing conclusions. know initial phase also go outside much normally would stuff would normally closed. thing lock can't say right tool end discussion. right tool circumstances, many others not.

Having hard lock lot community spread simply stupid. external borders focus lot spread. Extremely harsh social distancing rules lead fatigue make sense unless there's lots viruses going around community.

You're basically making sure long term compliance go benefit.

Czech Rep. another country got wrong. I'll party. shouldn’t looking one day increases, looking trends large period time. Stop scare tactic propaganda. People spending hours doors wearing mask cramped restaurants, especially given rate infection. people actually ate something continued socialize mask indoors, would helpful well, Westerners going Western. -\_- Last week dude harassed 79 year mother wearing mask town. People walked around guy like Moses parting sea. mother hard time walking cane got shouted right face. fucking cried.  article matter terrible “science” is, change mind conclusions. That's warning. Latency several weeks hospitals. majority world gross yearly income $1200. I'll take US anyday that. sisters. Bipolar disorder.

Yeh, I'm buying that. Bipolar disorder make want stab someone 27 times. Quite opposite, buying either. could've....left?

I mean, could also purchased face masks *IN store*. Yes, says things conservatively, orange audience 1. 

I hope right, again....logistics wheelhouse, I'm sure we'll get things done nearly fast think will.  Shit, though New York owners least blasted computer duster left. local bar road require masks. ""assume medical condition"". (I live 30 minutes north Milwaukee)  helped makes sense people know reject idea physical distancing wearing facemasks Ioannidis   [Poe's working overtime year. ridiculous schools open European countries. Asian countries always shut schools first see cluster infections open last. Like, learn countries actually good numbers? world put place mandatory quarantine people US last fourteen days.   Stanford keeps coming new studies showing IFR lower science could possibly support? coincidence? look curve, [nothing since lifted restrictions. Again, point government restrictions can't slow virus. states/areas hit similarly, hence metropolitan areas hit hard back April we're finally seeing rural areas get hit. Anti-maskers really issue us. Everyone Toronto wears masks. rare see someone wearing mask indoors. that's going help source spread unmasked situations, like private gatherings family dinners stuff. Okay Halloween _orgies_ still fine, right? Everyone wears mask! No. get alternative painful lesson. Shove stick everyone's nose they're line security? they've gone through, earlier, result ready. (Colorado) budget left pay unemployment. Literally unless federal government provides stimulus nothing Polis without causing untold economic damage. videos back people collapsing street

Considering never happened anywhere except videos China doubt real. Noem letting people state die.  “An altercation began, guard attempting grab phone, struck garbage can.” That’s literally guard trying do, it’s article. Wow ok, serious clamp down. enforce though? rely neighbors reporting you? Well, I'd point experience typical lot Christians (*especially* evangelicals). lifelong atheist (I'm 36 now, converted 32), I'm also scientist. already liberal worldviews baked in. I've definitely face challenge many preconceived notions world, I've 100% noted liberal come still Christian. 

So again, liberal atheist scientist convert, experience atypical, views probably flawed Christians. tell ton churches utterly ashamed behavior White Evangelicals, think Trump morally unfit leader, feel burden responsibility try ""clean up"" mess others made. almost impossible battle, *are* trying. wish many would try harder.

I could write book topic, it'd involve lot Christian theology probably interested (I know atheist I'd rolled eyes), but... yeah. 

A lot us converts bring liberal viewpoints church, feel obligated fight cancer fundamentalism. Christians better chance getting Christians (hopefully), try take initiative fight good fight.

Eventually, hopefully, extremists die time replaced kinder, liberal youth. try optimistic, sigh. call mothers want risk life kids? it’s private medical information make sure person telling actually person. got it, get to? Guess what's around turn, Covid-19, alot it. Anyone questioning take one look Instagram stories, blatantly obvious people give fuck anymore. I'm UK, looking pretty rough numbers-wise moment, virtually everyone know stridently posting staying home March/April back bars/pubs/restaurants friends nothing's changed, aside odd mask there. Fact is, aside who've seriously, extremely clinically vulnerable work/live extremely vulnerable people, fear gone most, know they're healthy 40 risk harm infinitesimally small.

Is right? grand scheme things probably not. honestly can't judge people fed eight months shit trying move back normality, normality humans *meant* live. Doctors reports aren’t second hand. people died reason tested positive covid 19 last 28 days  agree you, would also posit movie absolutely *terrible* title top off. yet. like took several months find first reinfections though, probably reasonable hypothesize vaccine immunity last least several months, let us get thing control. Even though would impossible many people, many others could work home government made mandatory possible. want ""isolates"" people. mandatory, 20% french companies allow workers work home (not sure exact % get idea) need years. got 2 years ago. Hard lesson, get every year. I’m sure wrote makes think didn’t say sick. said survived likelihood anyone odds. 

High group risk =/= high individual risk. That’s t-shirt that’s needed:

“It’s going take death loved one, wear mask, right?” sick misinformation. 6% crap, IFR like Flu, hoax, masks work, crap gets repeated again. kids young 12 years old

Do kids volunteer parents volunteer them?  mentally ill wearing mask.. stay away crazies low Vit result low immunity, reason sickness

Did read studies point beneficial effect vitamin immune system, especially regarding protection infections. conservatives hostile, callous, deceitful. 

In news, water wet. Absolutely. still reusing N95’s hospital. Usually it’s one per shift now, still WAY longer recommended use time March so.... “recommendations” magically changed became “safe” use longer..... Funny people arguing masks cut oxygen also arguing allowed send children masks door door begging candy pandemic. 50kiu long *a lot*, alarm you. might wanna ask, ideally 30ng/mL - 60(ish)ng/mL (low highest)

but hey mean, thats bod needs maintain levels thats cool, get blood check Mg vitamin k2 well. influence levels :) Ineffective mortality. Which, btw, even Gilead's studies indicated. seem help patients hospital quicker critical stage, though, useful hospitals. think corrupted word conservative. Conserving certain things good, natural resources, example. pretty crazy wild-ass squandering. think run greed. makes even worse, call someone wearing mask however politely, risking safety. Ein neue Wort fuer mich. Danke. common sense? Interesting paradox got there, could make ~~religion~~ TV show it! admitted bully physically preventing people getting elevator. prevent disabled people getting elevator like bouncer. That's tad fucked. mean cancelled? People still gather like thanks giving lol. virus. bacteria. non-living pathogen falls apart pieces time. trick contaminate everything everyday again. everyone stays home, sick (asymptomatic) people defeat it, virus around. 

Doesn't need winter, three 100%-compliance weeks. well seems like poor decision behaviour like really makes question future species

If makes feel better, actually improvement. incident shocking unusual nature. But, past, stuff like happened time. law order did. Yes, people deserve rot jail, overall, species, we're improving. enough. ways go. we've also come long way!  need get side shortage -- available _all_ willing use it.

Aside popular acquired immunity -- via vaccine simply masses infections -- that's one way we're going get case count drop.   Yeah that's really want get close scream/spit us. possibly stab us 27 times. initially cleared compassionate care. EUA step 1. Even basic level social skills. Aggressively invading people's space really disruptive. Wtf psychos lately. mentioning United States? mentioned /r/COVID19Positive - See:  actually construed child abuse? mentioning United States? Pretty soon every entrance resemble jewelry store entrance need buzzed in. doc wrote prescription Vitamin D. then, President say doctors idiots. /s Lugenpress Go post /r/COVID19Positive think bs see tell you. Read example (from month back):  mom pressuring fly across country holidays. says double mask respirator it’ll fine. really don’t want risk getting sick, bringing Covid hometown, god forbid, getting older parents sick. anyone else navigating this? talking family holidays? r/absoluteunits yeah, seems China wiling spend money &amp; effort tests scale drop dime eradicate virus population, paraphrase old **where** problem first step fixing problem. probably 27th time I've seen article. see knowing actually helps anything.  Sort like allowed exercise one person restrictions person was. always exercise person, long within 10 km (5 km radius).

More recently, outside rules became two households could meet outside.

The bubble rule applies able visit single person household, essentially became extension household, bubble. Undercook fish? Straight quarantine. growing number officials across party lines calling nationwide mask mandate. 

If something simple obvious feds could make stick... Oh, wait, know: Tell states next round stimulus money tied mask compliance rate state. every percentage point 95% compliance, lose 5% stimulus money allocated. state 75% less compliance, better luck next time, get nothing round. female leaders, leaders nice hair. Canada well, uk, USA, Russia not. Xi pretty decent hair age, Korea Japan leadership. Remember good old days Karen wanted speak manger? Say “Cantor Fitzgerald” next time someone mentions remembering 9/11. say “who?” think would asocial. — Gov. Jared Polis warning Coloradans remain vigilant coronavirus case numbers all-time high hospitalizations reached highest levels since May.

.... continues keep schools, bars, restaurants, dispensaries open without restrictions. unspent money get burned end day. there, somewhere, needs get collected shared. 

war bonds time. it’s deadly 99.9% Americans. 0.1%, stay home. travel. understand definition rich. They're stopped ordinary rules.0 can't believe dude alive! really extra careful people coming Utah. ""Wants"" really come play; suppression dictates must stop huge influx new cases. Hawaii state without federal help. Flying lupus... straight sucks. security guard health clinic deal anti-maskers time.

I decided buy concealable body armor stab resistance. one super hostile yet, figure better need need dead. good see world leader listening scientists what's right country... Must nice Lol. think there’s risk? Okay. I’m physician seen many 30’s “no risk” die long term complications. Also, seeing people come months apparently Covid (many asymptomatic), end chest CT’s assess PE, etc finding long term damage (pulmonary fibrosis well damage organ systems). course, anecdotal meaningful right now, promise studies released long term effects next year (I personally know least 4 ongoing ones, one directly involved in). say you’re simply willfully ignorant don’t like reality. 


Also, everything you’ve said selfish hell. There’s way describe it. You’ve literally put seeing baseball game important 1/100 lives. beyond messed up. Putin actually smarter Trump. Putin least PhD economics. Nah, F@H going strong since 2000, looking protein folding patterns initially think. Predates BTC almost decade. I'm going put I'm huge piece-of-shit-asshole, mask necessary outing, pump hand sanitizer sticking pocket. Comment history proof assholery.

Doesn't mean anything, sharing perspective. close borders start mass testing early like Norway did. also properly isolate elderly care homes. Norway closed schools couple weeks well I'm sure much impact - local scientific committee openly it.

Afaik immigrant communities Stockholm also got hit disproportionately hard. thing set precedent lockdowns. Sounds like kid smarter lot adults. Ah, talking ass! explains it. icu week France France France Oh true...I forgot tornadoes didn’t exist till 70s

See I’m board climate change. constant nonsense every single bad weather occurrence somehow related republican policy asinine. It’s prop left use convenient drive tax increases negative policy changes. betting man, would say he's going complain.... takers? horrible, useless human being. Trash. total? country 7000 cases less total? guess two questions rate general population 80%, covid affects vitamin levels people deficient hospital deficient got sick.

Not scientist think research consistently showing vitamin actually indeed somewhat protective. 27 charges attempted murder. got it, make sense Thanks propaganda blanket. lies Go lick boots Please accept condolences loss. Indeed know grief impairs sorts weird, unpredictable, unexpected ways. 

Be patient can. losses like yours, takes full five years learn live it.

In US, longer understood.

PS: haven’t read book either since mother died. 💐 thing happened wife. coming handfuls. It’s gone back normal now. 100% mouth insults rude customers mask. sooo cathartic able instead fake smile look apologetic. Exactly bars New Zealand full, shops full people, people living normal virus eliminated, spending money keeping economy going. NZ eliminated virus twice. new outbreak always possible, freed lots testing tracing resources focus quarantine points entry. another quarantine mishap happens, proven squash outbreak onset community spread. Community spread must prevented early. *karens intensify* consider fairly empathetic terms ability relate others sympathize feelings. also want go high-profile corporate job, think possible attain significant degree wealth without someone getting exploited.

No way HELL ever nurse/teacher/social care worker would DESTROY me. Nice mid-level office work me, please thank you. ""We listen called experts.""

Kristi Noem Well expect official advice wear it? Seriously, literally live NYC person personally know got lives Louisiana mildly sick couple days lasting effects. person I'm connected that's died friend's 94 year old grandpa also stage 4 cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm minimizing severity clearly killed hundreds thousands left lot people lasting symptoms. nearly everyone dramatic personal experience Covid many rural people believe they're risk. live mostly rural county, although area considered exurb huge city. people spend time city suburbs way diligent taking precautions. farther away city go, less likely people take precautions. small towns rural part county, masks rarely worn crowd events happening normal. Church services, in-person school, high school football, homecoming events, tailgating, weekend farmer's markets, fall festivals, church bazaars, parades, dine-in restaurants, pumpkin patches, retail shops, Halloween events last weekend coming weekend. Thanksgiving Christmas events planned next several weekends. full crowds, social distancing, masks. 20 hospital beds 0 ICU beds county. ongoing Covid-19 testing happens county. mindset ""it's nonissue"". lived Saudi ten years. FUN. modernizing Saudi women’s equality Bs don’t fall lol. Right. gov mandating cannot open business... I'm saying data suggests good masks might protect user well, use masks everyone room protect user better. Statistics edge cases, know that. use N95 + surgical mask whenever around people, great. many, many people can't, various reasons. However similar even superior protection achieved everyone wear masks, even lower quality N95. may counterintuitive, think physics aerosol viral communication, makes sense it? Reduction sources far effective trying filter multiple viral intakes consistently. FinndBors, thanks explication. ""I givr evidence, win."" would doctor scare you? Threatening college students scaring giving money. 
 
That understandable understood. Gap years tough many can't handle them. 

As someone worked home earlier year..I freaking loved it. 
 
Make sure keep morning routine work space access window sunlight ability look away time time adjust eyes. 
 
I understand WFH lot different listening teachers day try make fun make sure get steps in. Atleaat 5k day. Laura Ingraham embarrassing... People act like released goin go delivered Amazon prime something. going awhile. changed non-profit ""largely"" reasons comfortable largely non-profit vaccine purely subjective. take effective vaccine point. raised poorly Florida hostile workplace wish right.

But reality care ""want"" true.  Let’s make sure get vaccine last bet want watch kids day. nosedick lol wear masks instead burning could now. I'd say they're shooting foot this, they're shooting us all. Oh 100%, even know two vote That's good know. Thank information.

I course cynical. reading main stream media simply seems many areas right 7 months ago going again. 

Where live, leeward side Utah, seeing big upswing cases. Hospitals seem OK, ski season starting. Basically guy said. get downvoted you’re wrong. us though. us live sticks love close nature. husband last pocket old rural hippies. bad nature comes side-order idiots midwest.

But leftists read books everything. activists family. woods beautiful here, people batshit crazy. first year we've considered re-locating. Badlands, Black Hills Mount Rushmore, it’s got great things going lot buthurt Chinese brigaders Fauci said he's ""hopeful"" we'll see first broadly available vaccine spring 2021 *if absolutely nothing goes wrong testing, manufacturing, distribution*. Read interviews. ends 2-dose series (which **extremely** common), going look spring 2021 **plus** however many months wait 2nd dose. Again, that's *if everything goes perfectly*. ""Broadly available"" mean everyone time. Regardless *start* vaccinating Joe Bob street, going take months, year, get everyone office get shot. 

Also, given well we've done PPE far, I'm real sanguine ability government come with, say, enough syringes this. They've fucked everything else, too?

Fauci also admitted said 2022 think there's hope Americans responsible long, regardless state pandemic. Given people like others commenting thread, think it'll god damned miracle keep even half America behaving New Year's Day 2021, let alone **any** day 2022. Show proof test 50% accurate know many days ago......sure help 4 cases school district far week.

Due ""effective contact tracing"" say school closing high school. cases elementary schools fine hybrid schedule continue.

Still everyone freaking lol. Teachers already edge. groups Israel literally trying breed red heifer (like, throwing crapton science money it) birth red heifer supposed one kick-start signs apocalypse.

They succeeded 2018. See also: Phil Scott, governor Vermont know...someone understands going spread Covid walking someone outside sun, cause know...science. would little surprised happened. Like, immensely surprised. mind it, I'd 10/10 shocked. Wait, Russia progressive covid response America? Man, getting shone Russia sad day. Constitution this, constitution that...  wearing mask giving us antisocial folks bad name. half people country probably thinks coming. Update: Turning corner sure... Schools: *""Let's stupid weak open schools. responsible. like telling parents news want hear, want deal pushback. outsource responsibility Covid-19 prevention parents!""*

Parents: *""Hold beer.""* I’m sure 0 fat loser rally pointlessly stupid comment. go. There’s conceivable reasoning people belong anywhere near civilized society. belong cell, permanently. Mask mandates everywhere, COVID still skyrocketing country... Yes sadly applied politics drawing line sand choosing believe revert given point. north hemisphere country, Spain march, one countries luminous intensity Europe, country Europe goes worse.- i'll divorce opinions china: indictment duterte criticism chinese, stance reflects grossly unprepared is. obviously plans deal cold chain storage requirements headaches involved distribution. all-but-begged china conduct human trials country he's also trying weasel way paying it, since country's quarantine measures proved inadequate options sitting hands waiting bigger country save ass

the country's bunch fucking islands, supposed need damn vaccine hard. fucked does, doesnt know *Slams Table*

""27 Stab Wounds! want leave chance, you?"" kids probably wouldn’t symptoms severe enough get tested anyway

Edit: said say underreported say they’ll fine doesn’t matter folks denied health insurance behavior. great financial risk industry, communities. That's actually funny. Antimaskers like

_I fear man thing... scares me._ Im this...

*heavy breathing* - anger tho Ummmm cant catch covid test befor fly? covid know negative test? seasonal coronavirus epicurves see substantive increase start November (we're even yet), massive spike December January.

This bad. even started. mean yes. known. posted link. answers questions there. trust others research. Please take care ride bus get work, guy sit next wasn’t wearing mask. quietly got moved seat ahead, response started screaming me, followed bus, demanded take mask. Unfortunately sometimes minding business isn’t enough. Came say this. anti-social ""enlightened self interest"". Impulsive behavior risk-taking actually correlated anti-social traits.  think tough one prove *mens rea* also ANAL. That's good! Sad good! 7 days results come back. Yeah lab testing backed up. federal government jack shit it.

This trump's america, folks.

Vote. unless put country lockdown again. way enforce that. one point rickets level vitamin D. Colorado, 300 days sunshine us deficient anyways. going shocking What? dems fighting tooth nail stimulus. Even though getting stimulus would help president win reelection. put politics aside pushed help American people.

One party responsible lack stimulus. Let’s blame “politicians” recent surge due breaking rules, that's ridiculous. entire region completely opened business numbers went summer they've reluctant impose new restrictions economic impact. US, Trump specifically, made mess response, let's try rationalize away cause current situation Europe. would still done, government approval certain groups (ie. Saudi Arabia). Also, allow robbery MURDER neighbors try compare wearing mask mentally ill. Typical American parent. Like explained another reply, it’s practical sounds theory take gap year. 

When take gap year it’s usually build funds school work experience, go traveling. It’s really hard find work cases college student, especially one would pay decently, finding job relevant field build experience also hard find. can’t travel either, least foreign countries like gap-year college backpackers would want do. 

You can’t take gap year spend entire time nothing, would likely happen lot students. Also you’re case, you’ve already taken gap year can’t really justify another one. 

Also I’ve heard cases programs told students take gap year they’re guaranteed spot back fall 2021. Probably can’t afford lose anymore money, it’s shitty I’ve heard happening. I’m sure widespread though. I’ll take rugged Russian nurse now. Julius Caesar would't Mine 12 elearning choice. sick assumed also contagious quarantined never got tested.  Make sure gettin' wanna get C Where’d come conclusion lol. Trump manifests inside head. I'm right this. Folks sticking dumb face door bitching complaining infect shop dick holsters. like everyone's gone insane, :(  It’s like idea hasn’t set us back decades research, funding believed professionals lay people anything. would amusing genie wish see happen action around world.

Either hand would materialize punch them, would punch themselves, someone nearby would fly punch them.

God damn genies, better specific. Exactly trying stabbing 32 times kill him??? Seatbelts another good example. Hahaha bullshit. actually anti social wear mask difficult communicate one Ahem... research”, “educate yourself” “WAKE SHEEPLE”

walk public library ask titles. also wonder matters escalated physical altercation. two women requested wear masks use hand sanitiser help mitigate spread coronavirus, refused began film security guard phone asked altercation began, guard attempting grab phone, struck garbage can. two women began punch him.

So apparently refused put masks, began filming guard. become physical tried grab phone them?

The title article makes sound like stabbed telling put masks, article makes sound like stabbed tried grab phone instead letting film him. I've read countries allow randos run around guns, even though knife attacks have, victims often survive. Also, lot wounds may slash wounds rather actual stab wounds. point sympathy lagging. Right? I’m forced back days person 100 percent productive home anyway. Backwards idiots Yea I’m anti-social wearing mask. old man pushing 77. honestly believe responsible death? explained you. Twice. Read comments carefully miss points made extremely clear. 

No. point *lockdowns work*. Oh look Spain. Spaniards silly. see lockdowns work. People keep dying. Swedish strategy scientific sustainable.

Then Sweden wants lockdowns rebrands ""recommendations"". seems *staying inside* effective. recommended 7 months late. Sad people die. could used ~~lockdowns~~ ""recommendations"" ~~stay inside~~ ""avoid public transit, areas like malls physical contact"" March. common knowledge now, hopium addicts accept reality.

Sad. rural America. Residents populous states like California, Texas, Florida, New York moving rural areas ""beat"" COVID. refuse wear masks generally condescend original residents receiving healthcare one else state can. states forbidding residents leaving state. major US cities, state city officials actively discouraging people getting tested keeping bars restaurants open. 

It's entire country; uneducated morons calling shots uneducated morons, 230,000+ deaths. shit. Maybe mean say asocial. Anti-social behaviors usually harm others. consideration others also anti-social behavior. live slapbang equator vit deficiency!

The sun fierce nobody would go sun without strong sunblock covering! $5 rapid test coming beautiful new healthcare plan top line presidential level covid treatment free! ready 2 weeks. Summer best time contain virus, yet white house nothing. see lots people think they've twice. thread, actually. 

Moreover, people asymptomatic one times. immune response longevity dependent severity, meaning asymptomatic cases would probably likely yo immunity wear off.

And testing limited earlier days, course time period we've longest immunity wear off.

Given incredibly restrictive evidence counts confirmed case reinfection, surely massive undercount. ...no shit really??? fucking surprise! /s Many stupid ppl. Come onnnn, stuff reach. gladly wear mask I'm totally antisocial. kurwa Roger complete bullshit. Wow, crazy study: antisocial behavior symptom antisocial people 😂

Whats next? Karen's tend ask managers? YouDontSayDotJPEG  
C’mon dude, gotta hit one mega-karma phrases get traction here. 

Winter coming. 

Nobody cares town except me, haven’t left home since March! 

This us looooonnnnggggg time, even vaccines. 

I’m antivaxxer I’ll never take vaccine that’s released administration. ...are advocating war? What? Yes, invalidate study presented reported researchers. issue goes *credibility*: seen massive, obvious flaw, right question credibility researchers themselves. 

It invalidate data, data therefore cannot comment. 

It also mean conclusion drew wrong - conclusion drawn could completely correct, *unwarranted* set data used. Even conclusion correct, *this study* warrant it. 

And egregiousness error, no, overstated it. professional scientist instantly saw it. I’ll give credit morons assume *and* peer reviewers saw error - massive central study, exactly peer reviewers looking for. Accepting assumptions, conclusion fully aware “error” chose make ... brings us back credibility, indicates intentional bias. Again, doesn’t mean conclusion wrong - *this study* legitimate support it. 

Bad science bad science, even like conclusion.

Edit: assumption regarding impact skepticism behavior, perfectly valid (and agree it), place legitimate scientific study, certainly unstated. Oppressed minorities along gamers graphs Europe alarming, countries full exponential growth. it??? 206 hospitalizations, difference people hospital compared previous day. New hospitalizations. already 9296 hospital. No, sense. Narcs think rules apply them, even science says otherwise. tell text drive, say ""I'm good driver"" even fact they're texting driving means good drivers. applies masking One older lady told go fuck probably right One gets coughing fit (not bad surgical mask, still gets one) got kind asthmatic attack anything slightly active. athletic used active. one gets asthma attack one probably suffering covid long term. got international competition (severe respitory infection longer normal incubation period) never really recovered. talking someone competed 2 sports getting sick, can't focus can't breath practice uses mask getting practice (public transport). think resmidivir got full FDA clearance? news 11: dip shit neighbor wont make dogs shut That's happened to. people say. oh.. gosh forgot mask! neighbors (not all) start telling friend doctor told masks dont work something like that. hate it.

I stand door let people moron week half ago two family members (who rent room us) started exhibiting symptoms. initially tested negative (which believe false negative) tested positive beginning last week. We’ve strict isolation since, bedroom husband, newborn symptoms. Friday husband started exhibiting symptoms fever Saturday yesterday evening. got retested Sunday far everyone tested positive me. I’m still negative mild symptoms I’ve experiencing also attributed weather changes wildfire smoke. (Thankfully baby symptoms well). 

There’s possibility back January - whole workplace super duper sick flu. Fevers lasting week, chest congestion month+ “recovered” half us (myself included) tested positive flu. I’m thinking possibly Covid well? would make sense I’ve exposed week neither baby gotten sick (I pregnant time).

Has anyone else someone household consistently test negative rest positive? long reasonably wait assume I’m getting it? first exposure would bee friday 10/16, consistent exposure since. gotta get first wave first, get experience second one Agree, perfect, would still interesting. could honestly see banning airlines testing could see this. Yes, answer coronavirus basically bubonic plague - repent sins (those phantasmagoric student parties) show repentance (e.g. wearing mask *outdoors*, absolutely useless) maybe divine scourge avoid us!

700 years later learnt anything, *sigh*. really miss seeing people laugh smile, wearing masks ensures we'll still around smile laugh future, I'm perfectly fine that. size sun, use Fauci already said vaccine likely approved beginning December. approved, mass distribution take months April/May access. Mask still recommended, mandatory would say wrote perfect American . rather burn liberals white house. support president even obstacles democrats place front us. mean keeping kids inside hundreds kids adults barely enforced restrictions?  well color shocked! Mhm seriously like Idea average person able travel anymore seems. people seee leading ,we'll wake restrictive dystopia ,which make ex USSR look like liberal fairy-tale bcs flu practically affect healthy population. I'm saying i'm indifferent old died Covid bcs sever pre-exsisting illnesses, enslavement average person, destroying private middle sized businesses causing people develop human-fobia live online answer.

[There plenty Dr's new research ,which support ""the plague"" Umm... help oust Trump scenario. main propagator covid disinformation.  Yeah, exactly. look ""Anti social personality disorder"" see DSM diagnostic criteria. OTOH, measure find link opposing public health measures (i.e. anti-masker) antisocial traits.

Right, would bet correlation anti-masker **actually wearing mask** very, high. Seriously. hear people saying can't overdose vitamin time flat lie. even know rumour started  Wow gave hope seconds go out, often think, ""Please make talk you."" I'm polite talk people, I'd often prefer to. know say, ""People social animals?"" Well, I'm not. 

But still wear damn mask. Good Lord media lost it. Chaos ladder watching streams Japan China yesterday people basically back normal.

We've always wondered would East seemed always primary culture control Futuristic fiction, we've got answer: War economic choices made West fall, lack care failure wear masks plague.

Eastern countries economies roaring West sputters stalls. think getting point

An endorsement US human rights would've completely OK books

Yet dismiss Saudi Arabia's oppressive nation SA critical ally US

It's almost like starting see accusations are, apart **baseless** manufactured, also *hypocritical*

Nevertheless, that's besides point. asked proof China majority support nations worldwide. provided it. think opened indoor dining all, could explain it. even vaccine. Oxford's. Pfizer's zero issues even expanded trials much larger initially planned doubt less Spanish Flu developing countries younger populations record fewer deaths per capita. still justify letting people die countries older populations mind letting people get otherwise preventable damage ethical code. ethical code clearly different there's use arguing that.

As chart, literally shows deaths per millions trend line. account advancements? did, would show estimate deaths without hospitals medication. ultimately educated speculation, free draw conclusions, seems weird use chart say bad trend line clearly shows less deaths advancement. argument without ability consistently treat people, would look worse.  seems article antibodies gone 3 months, really depended severity infection. Yeah agree good news. weren't, showers would weird. likely many people get virus mild, symptoms. idea percentage, say 50% arguements sake. 

You test 1000 peple, symptoms, get 300 cases. test 10000 asymptomatic people, get another 300 cases - suddenly media arms ""Cases double overnight"" looks bad politicians.

The reverse also partly true. Europe, first wave, enough tests symptomatic people prioritised. % death toll looks far higher proportion (you 300 cases, 18 people died - 6% fatality rate - media arms) Oh wow that’s amazing, find study would mind sharing? love psychology would interested reading Totally this. Quarantine general great me. It’s okay, can’t go article line line explain getting. 

I’m interested bad faith arguments.

Best wishes endeavors. argumentative position tells part story. Nobody says state country lockdown virus goes away.

Lockdowns work unless everybody it, used concert effective testing tracing, addition good social distancing/mask usage. Many things done concert. means shorter lockdown, less expenditure government stimulus packages, quickly reopening economy while, importantly, reducing number people die.

The argument lockdown seems disingenuous effort government convince people choose money lives government screwed initial response. 

It's like telling jogger, ate 3 pizzas day smoked pack, exercise help it? We're two steps away people blaming covid lockdown. pass school? ""First addition, subtraction, MUTIPLICATION DIVISION?"" literally everything worked planning going EUA status? Western vaccines.  8000iu gang KN95s N95s, post replied mentioned. Oh God, spy smuggle microfilm stuffed ass? determined lab. viral vector vaccines (J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, China) use adenovirus there's chance they're going get strong antibody response people could exposure before. mRNA ones might effective expense harder distribute, requiring 2 injections using less proven technology. That's bit armchair layman who's talked doctors involved vaccine trial. Ultimately efficacy determined real world. type person facebook making stupid comments. ....says Ameriduh can't write proper English, let alone French. 

Go away, Duh. Sorry hear it. shit coworker upset wear masks. fear moment everyday. call letting virus burn ravaging population ""under control"" sure. one group containing other, there's overlap. people would agree principle necessity wearing masks, actually wear laziness peer-pressure. 

So study actually find links *not wearing mask* antisocial traits, that's measured.

OTOH, measure find link opposing public health measures (i.e. *being anti-masker*) antisocial traits. Lmao...the irony. article mention people Poland, found one virus targets people bars clubs. take out, cut legs.

/s people gotta something post social media, something impress friends. best wedding ever went to, 1976. couple college friends getting married. rented non-denominational chapel school, got couple friends provide music (guitar flute), us (including newly weds) folded chairs swept floor. simple, fluff, nothing top. confirm this. I'm participant blood draw scheduled tomorrow. Remember people reaction China amount daily death January?

I cant believe currently happening many countries people numb seeing figures. Chinese muslim. Chinese Christian. totalitarian. talk tiananmen square. enough social points. think china free America? plus side, US allies around world China none bar neo-colonial belt road vassals. military power projection also miles away.

But war far unlikely unfortunately.  Surgical mask protects N95 fluids such. Helps N95 last longer , standard protocol hospital system actually. Europeans seem listen clear rules like lockdowns, curfews mask mandates. Asian countries, people tend wear masks distance without forced so.

Unfortunately that's actually quite contrary happening: (European) government treat us like children, people react like children find ways go around rules. (Treating us like adults, done Asia, tried). mean 17 year olds brain becomes legal drink babies 🤔 lot misinformation French TV variety sources.

- wont second wave severe first.

- Cases arent important hospitalizations deaths arent rising.

- able control spread virus precise less severe measures March.

As far see policy past number months screen experts appearing TV ensure view never contradicted government aspirations. I'm American! opposite. I’m antisocial love mask idea. keeps away people keeps safer disease might have. imagine social people would ones going wearing mask caring.   hilarious

yeah, ww3 incoming getting older see reason optimism. Hundreds thousands people died. election, given choice two candidates beholden corporate interests. difference Biden actually give us bread circus. Trump, circus get bread/peanuts thrown us. 

I've seen enough elections know really matter. US sold highest bidder decades ago, watching death rattles empire. good run. But, really think watching end. something wake one day. slow process. Now, seeing protesters sides start become violent toward eachother, feds deployed stop happened Portland, CHAZ, etc. Trump wins, left go crazy. Biden wins, right Lol almost 3 months! renewed last week online realized fact gotten pulled (in area get warning first one time late like got twice...) DMV extended grace period til November 1st. received sticker renewal mail yesterday, days shy end grace period. Hopefully that’s going change. rather, testing capacity reaches limits hospitals test serious cases, CFR skyrocket. overwhelming hospitals highly unlikely scenario, never happened certain North European country instance despite r/coronavirus warning otherwise... Yeah, there's definitely strain puritanism, health purity morality going around, logical least.  Douchemia pre-symptomatic asymptomatic asymptomatic. get frustrated asymptomatic used pre-maturely. seems almost always asymptomatic stage. Says internet doctor right? That's honestly left say. Nobody knows truth right Truth Hurts! *surprised Pikachu face* That’s meme right here!

Mask burning wingnut mean, education important. We're pretending like exist schools, education important risk deny education Democrats national health problem, actively lying exaggerating pandemic it’s ruining people’s lives Presumed reinfection, actually genetic sequencing prove reinfection. I.e. positive test, negative test, positive antibody, another positive test. Sure, random Sweden's new temporary pandemic law take effect next summer. others spread ilk don’t deserve platform. 

now actively pushing censorship. aaron swartz one creators reddit would disgusted, yet would defend right say this.

and rest comments accusing things, might future??? nonsense that.

i put peer reviewed research, instead actually responding research try ignore claiming would react??? 

what nonsense writing there.

you yet respond actual references, instead try distract people them.

this work character matter. matters facts.

trying distract people research work.

respond research stop wasting everyone's time suggest. Like said, released general public HUMAN TRAILS CURRENTLY HAPPENING show safe effective. Thank you! Makes sense, keep mind. cannot pick single example make seem schools world. told rare case really don’t think that’s true. 

I taking 5000iu vitamin k2 help absorbtion year. vitamin levels recently tested lower end average. That’s including vitamin sunlight decent amount sunlight/tanning. 

My doctor recommended 5000iu generally, deficient before. evidence i’ve seen points incredibly difficult body much vitamin d. I’ve heard plenty people taking 10-20k iu vitamin problems well. 

Please spread misinformation. Nothing new there. wear mask people free society freedom expose themselves, free people make decision 99.96% survival rate flu, risk.

COVID never going away. wear mask social distance closed economy eternity highlights suffering Dunning-Kruger effect.

Fun fact: closed economy kill people COVID ever will. Maybe they're less certain efficacy masks. Chicago suburbs wear masks everywhere people. way months, still covid-19 cases area rising.

I family comply state local mandates, I'm far convinced anything useful productive. sympathetic view toward people wear mask (although yet encounter anyone view, because, again, EVERYONE wears mask time), I'm half wondering vindicated end. Italy, dudes, good look you. Yall got HAMMERED first wave. Maybe cool it? look forward attempt immortality. Even swath population elect get vaccine immediately due desire understand long-term side effects efficacy vaccine. that’s people understand trust science behind vaccines. Please name one country guaranteed achieve herd immunity vaccine gets released? Cattle Maybe officially declared cause death? Here's easy reading article: conference room, Song showed Mapo District Office Web site, dozen cases confirmed area organized date neat table. entries, appended detailed list stops patient made, sparse, sterile language, read like ship’s logbook. “08:00 left home (on foot) / mask worn,” began one entry Mapo’s fourth patient, dated March 6th 10th. post went note bus subway transfer (“Bus transfer no. 7730 front Sangam High School → disembarked Susaeggyo / mask worn”), well six-minute stop local supermarket, ending “15:00 tested positive → 19:00 transferred Seoul Medical Center.” Emergency text alerts, character limit, linked recipients entries rather relaying full. “For text alerts, use something called ‘remote broadcasting apparatus,’ ” Song said. “Then it’s sent every phone five-kilometre radius nearby base station.”

Here actual scientific paper tracing. doesnt include government responded results. believe also google map hotspots covid people could avoid areas. I’m trying give context someone AMERICAN would say OP said. Sorry wasnt clear. meant examples incorrect predictions past months.

Everyone statements aired TV papers both. heard one repeated colleagues family fact weeks months end. Americans also think Africa country thank hooligans radical feminists flooding streets protests. 50% Poles observations walking around town wear masks properly (below nose, even chin). People talk think virus fake. also seem understand necessity social distancing ie. protests public health emergency horrifying idea. ashamed fellow citizens right now, truly become laughing stock world.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean feel like expected true lot virii. Yeah. gf hours city getting gas rural place, walk gas station legit 0 people masks , one guy sitting chin Duh I'm saying this, I'm saying reasoning is:


When mask on, supposed avoid touching much possible potentially transfer germs onto mask. running bunch errands safer leave face rather taking off. ridiculous. ordered ton KF94s distributing friends. Several declined ""they homemade masks"". KF94 literally $2! think look pretty decent - I’d tempted lean towards Oxford’s it’s produced non-for-profit basis. 

Unsure Pfizer guessing not? suppose right that. taking account politics race. said thought bad thing hope virus spread anyone, apologize that. someone Melbourne success comes vaccine here. live year small number infections like rest country find effective vaccine excellent obviously one never found it’s trouble. many countries relying it’s alone. “Apparently” mean? Hard positive days parents ones spoon feeding money work ground reality.I Sorry pampered enough optimistic right now. ""My six-year-old asked weeks ago, \`Dad, COVID-19 forever?' mean, he's Grade 1, supposed big year big boy, they're even singing classroom."" ""This \[pandemic\] sucks. really, really does.""

\-- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Man, husband, father.

Good one. Lose patience, get fed up, get velvet gloves ""grab"" people sabotage efforts ""by balls"". dont know means schools country use correct measures. Italy different, post talking covid Italy policy hospital husband works asymptomatic employee who's exposed Covid must work shifts start showing symptoms test positive. Otherwise, half staff would constantly quarantine operate.

It messed though. death rate lower United States (compared earlier year) due better treatment hospitals hit capacity? well planned king (though elected democratic election) Poland - sir Kaczynski. I've outside lunch time last two weeks, lunch restaurants packed. Packed like there's pandemic, close seating, barriers, masks inside eating, etc. 
This past Sunday late afternoon restaurants much full capacity, distancing, etc. Like, sure mask street, public transport, shopping... go eat spend 2 hours close proximity people packed restaurant. WTF?!  
 
Since moved France month ago I've eaten exactly - long day running errands around town dropped sandwich shop 10 minutes quick bite. That's it, everything else home-made delivered. local give traditional eating regularly - either work lunch work - month, help situation (IMO). God, fucking annoying. idea. doctor take specific prescription supplements super deficient ovarian cyst issue bunch reproductive stuff multi-vitamin. Consult doctor. see Paul Offit's comments October 22nd meeting? said ""he thinks language problem"" comes talking approval process, much closer FDA would use full approval drug normal times comes mind hear ""emergency authorization"" Oxford trial 50,000 enrolled? You’re thinking US trial perhaps?

They’ve also going quite bit longer started earlier MERS vaccine basis. hear you, Oxford vaccine particular quite attractive. basis vaccine development years, passed form safety trials, right? others would want see scientists reactions, Oxford, appears likely safest candidate right now. second wave severe first daily new cases breaking records? know deaths continuously low since March, prevents hospitals overcapacity later Winter?

Isn’t something like 1-2% population infected? jumps 5%? yeah, (and even more) blood hands. even interesting- polish catholic church supporting them... seems like there’s article confirming week here. subs turning circlejerk feeling (rightfully) righteous pandemic instead actual news. people even putting time study first place. Thanks! Uhhhh common guys really? would hoped wouldn’t want relive February March again??? usual, scroll way find this. they're trying ramp production fast possible, resource limitations. mRNA-derived vaccines like Moderna's said easier scaled up, even drug gets final approval later, flood market quicker. say happening refuse live fear.  what? Kids transmit virus? already knew that. I'm saying self distancing windows kept open, need mask. Italy, 0,037% students covid-19 two weeks ago ""We superior need none stuff yet achieve better result!"" say sides equally bad. said sides guilty decades interested expanding consolidating power serving people, that's truth. epidemic interesting seeing people masks outside good. People safe around other. Even outside ""safest"".

But also gives sense serious community taking virus general. Hopefully indoor areas around town personal lives. 

So town one even cares wear mask outside around others (outside one lower priority areas mask STILL IMPORTANT), imagine like indoors bars, restaurants, etc. People take consideration people's lives considering actions found anti-social. We'll in-depth report later evening. Stay tuned panel consisting worst people imagine. Apparently, curfew effective curb epidemic Guyane July. we're talking different climate compared mainland France. $5. upgrade options. base price may $5 test goes way sinuses. extra $20 get rapid test swab nose. diamond club members saliva test. manage small grocery store sells ton specialty food hard find elsewhere. someone comes store without mask I'll stop offer single use one. refuse get boot permanently banned. surprised many change tune longer able get supplies. could also present negative within 24 hours. perfect mitigating nonetheless. teacher, worried. course, keep job, mask face shield. Stay safe all. Studies use incredibly strict criteria scientific otherwise. 


I'm finding difficult figure criteria, exactly, would accept why. I'll place tonight 6:30, Stouffer's family size lasagna. "" throwing party honour tremendous success. Place device ground, lie stomach arms sides. party associate arrive shortly collect party. Make attempt leave testing area. Assume party escort submission position miss party. "" I'd guess lockdowns probably ""successful"" everywhere used far *slow rate spread*. difference actually achieved terms eradication vs suppression. I'd guess difference almost entirely based amount community spread onset policy.

Your question definitely important one agree still seems taboo discuss. goal solely suppress virus means necessary probably debating usefulness lockdowns. Obviously one unlimited number variables consider determining policy.

What interesting looking back strategies countries used 5 10 years now. think know right decision long time. think end pandemic see level field performance. Ah right. Yeah don’t know I’m afraid. vaccine approved April/May lucky. 6-12 months roll general population, you’re looking 2022 anything approaching normalcy. Stay home? couple years? Fuck that. Nothing like illegal action satisfy shallow political leaning.  virus 40M confirmed infections, going get outliers whose immune system react differently norm, example severely immunocompromised woman undergone chemotherapy Dutch case study. can't generalize outliers representative general population. you’re going attack attempt overwhelm nonsense “sources” taken context otherwise twisted. 

You continue throw “facts” demand perfectly absolutely refuted based set criteria. 

You declare absolutes move goalpost divert arguments absolutes challenged. 

When someone questions veracity source, spend time accusing ad hominem.

You never required follow logic claim requiring unfair “missing point.”

When someone finally takes time get fully granular asks question longer divert from, disappear. Poof, able spread propaganda one benefitted discussion.

I’ve there, waste time follow rabbit hole nonsense get away accountable claims, take opportunity abuse gaslight others.

You others spread ilk don’t deserve platform. sides equally bad issue. bridge collapsing town asked sound engineer thoughts. Rural hospitals often single-digit ICU beds, majority already used ""normal"" times, would waste money 40 ICU beds hospital 5 ICU patients.

So hospital 9 ICU beds ""overflows"" 5 normal patients 4 COVID patients, transfer patients nearby metropolitan hospital beds. Excess deaths occuring, cause alarm?

Another common thing hear ""ICU 90% capacity"" breakdown patient numbers. headline implies 11% surge COVID cases overwhelm hospital, hospital 20 beds 16 used 2 used COVID patients, actually handle 100% surge COVID patients.

Here's good write-up background, emergency room worker Las Vegas four years experience. cases ""spike"" media loves exaggerate posting headlines stating **ICUs full capacity reeeee**. experience anecdotal, explain media makes seems like people dropping like flies reality not. thing keep mind hospitals generally owned corporations whose purpose turn profit. institutions \*generally\* designed worst-case scenarios. Instead, designed accommodate best-case scenarios pocketbooks. mean say building massive ICUs would ultimately financially unwise corporatist's perspective. spend extra money hold ICU patients emergency room (if ICUs full capacity) bed becomes available floor? money perspective, win-win, something time say bad flu season atypical week. hospital, uncommon ICU reach capacity. big wigs want work staff little staff possible, keep nurses call case. Again, bad flu season patient volume increased inexplicably simply hire travel nurses fill needed roles. take much ICU reach full-capacity many hospitals, media deceives public fear mongers writing headlines. headlines ICUs reached full capacity hundreds times COVID existed? Exactly. saying ICUs reaching full capacity meaningful; nearly bad media would believe. like hundred beds standby chock-full. hospital, would mean extra three beds occupied, boohoo intensivist stay full-shift maybe instead going home early sleep. I'm shocked speaking rhetorically. thought wait long security last thanksgiving... hopes prayers Seems like nothing works. 26k day last week we'll probably another spike like soon bigger. Seems trend.

Edited add:
If google ""covid uk cases"" big interactive graph comes look cases deaths every single day since beginning. look country drop-down menu. anti social case mean anti society. seen seeing reddit count actual study many presumed reinfections are... Skåne is. guess arrogance bigger immunity less ""success"" spring. Republicans national health problem, actively lying misrepresenting pandemic killing people.... Unreal. Technically wrong doubling cases every five days. Right considered linear, we're headed towards exponential growth. 

It's really important distinction, bc we're fucked careen towards completely losing control. Yeah always BS answer, said cleaning stocking they're stocking day packed. test positive arriving airport? great reminder take multivitamins go walk blame completely. LMFAO dude blitzed. Summer 2021 masks gone restriction lifted thought efficacy determined severity disease real world? vaccines already proven produce antibodies, way test controlled lab antibodies attack coronavirus? Include ticket price. already covid fees anyway? Where's $5 rapid test promised top? 600% daily dose crazy, stop. Vitamin toxicity pretty serious, wreck havoc kidneys bones keep taking kind dose long-term. guess even lock down, people still meet. They’re sick measures.

Unless enact „You can’t leave house without good reason go next store“ policy like France Italy had, even lockdown won’t work. FAA rules regarding maintenance plane. However can't change human stupidity fly mask times likely safe especially flight super long. 7 hours quite long, would willing bet people best mask wearers beta tester. beta testers already got results coming in. vaccines ready, first used personnel front lines - doctors, nurses, medical personnel, policemen, firemen, politicians. people society needs function. Next come people vulnerable groups - old, diabetic, heart disease, etc. vaccine available everyone else. time vulnerable people vaccinated, pandemic developed world largely managed local epidemics present. Young healthy people die get hospitalized much, big burden system. unless doctor vulnerable, end 2021 2022 earliest get vaccine, millions people priority. time we'll certainly know head explodes shots. Us ginger folk naturally produce vit 'normies'

Among odd traits like needing anesthesia, poorly regulating body temp, commonly left handed.

Hashtag ginger things. people able go bar without fearing infection people selfish follow rules. 

It’s health safety requirement. places require shirts shoes? people want wear shoes stay home people don’t want wear want go out? No, everyone wears shoes don’t go in.

Edit add- measure favor safety society always win. People don’t want wear masks stay home party want. people wearing masks helping stop spread potentially deadly disease, deadly, long term consequences disease. issue chart takes numbers vaccuum. Sure, results similar, path getting involves 100 years medical sanitation advancement, mention first mitigation measures remember taken since Spanish Flu. History nothing without context data. you... think social scientists literally follow people around evaluate actions? exactly think would work?

It's possible use surveys legitimate science, done time. Good you. sarcasm. guys supposed pandemic: hunkering down, figuring ways lessen spread. 

It's nice see somewhere things going right. Thanks! well, supposedly mask protect others minds protecting anymore. Right on!  Seems like better use time taking shoes security. see you’ve included greatest hits early pandemic propaganda effort. Congrats. Probably 100,000 cases holiday season. Unfortunately never obvious, days Trump need see it, hope turn blind time Yea live Alabama one seems care wearing mask outside places require even care anyway dont wear one. feel like im one state takes virus seriously. doesnt help work father friend dont care covid one thinks wearing mask unconstitutional. fathers convinced gotten already somehiw immune. Kill Reddit hivemind censorship, get There's difference ""being anti-social person"" someone like social activities defined ""anti-social behavior."" ""Anti social"" latter sense means something like ""in opposition workings mechanisms society."" would things like lack empathy, disregard consequences actions self others, impulsive behavior, lying, stealing, causing others harm etc. learned nazi Germany, world superpower doesn’t matter everyone hates knows genocide committing say authority schools drivers pandemic false

We've said piece I'm going continue debating, neither side going convince other. I'd like say began saying schools major driver current outbreak said weren't. shown kids get coronavirus (something never argued against, argued get sick, statistically fact). shown schools outbreaks(something never argued against, obviously can, risks mitigated schools temporarily shut needed). Illinois 5000 cases day. Schools reported 500 total cases students. see evidence nationwide statewide schools major driving force pandemic. anecdotal, that's data points.

Also papers supporting point view. Read review feel free read multiple studies describe oppose point view. think I'm functioning solely anecdotal evidence? Meanwhile great leader still nothing.

In true fashion wait till hospitals verge collapse anything. also heard “Mom code” also applied avoid schools shut down. True, several countries require negative result within certain time frame depart/arrive. example, must test negative within 72 hours departure board flight Hawaii (which transfer hub East Asia Southeast Asia). Alternatively, pay fee rapid testing airport.  No, they’ll like name - let’s call party failure evidenced low response many vaccine posts.

Sure, get really popular small vaccine news seem less popular small „doom gloom“ news. person education cause irreparable harm young people? Probably ""I've heard"" completely useless discussing highly specific medical/scientific issue one particular sounds like complete bullshit.

There several means whereby somebody chronic vitamin deficiency, ""I've heard"" one them.  Nope. Happy hiding hole buy ammo shit hits fan, use take need morons guns. country days pop music twang (Bo Burnham put great song “Country Song (Pandering)” really nails it’s) really isn’t different rest pop music world. MaYBe SoRT hAGue TribuNAl MiGhT JuDgE him. 

A typical straw man argument get Tegnnellites. Don’t know expect group still day supports Vipeholm experiments. even really work. brother taking family Hawaii Thanksgiving. Hawaii requires negative test within 3 days entry - fine, wife go get test.

But kids 12. literally can't find anywhere test (because kids 12 risk).  longterm skin condition, basically childhood, would return every fall disappear summer.

Though taking daily multi-vitamin (800 IU), took additional supplement (+1000 IU) condition never since returned. ""Stop fear mongering.""


France setting records. tried. got fucked. Embarassing. Work delusional narcissism maybe stop odds reality. Bye bye 🤗 Yes China hardly small island country. Neither Australia. Sometimes people act like New Zealand success story. Meanwhile ignore populous country world entire continent. Wrong, blaming government action emotions. Switch username every while. that's eradicate virus, comrade! clear even without study Absolutely this. Friends lost houses wildfire describe similar feelings “fire brain”. saw neighbor put mask leaving porch, get car, drive away.

ummmm what? see leaving store want touch face home? seriously?

I'm sick theater. flaired ""South SE Asia""? Nope, well popular doctor, lobby always busy. Really shocked me, couldn’t think do. neighborhood hundreds deaths spring.... people can’t go clubs go private parties. helps events still taking place large numbers. 

However it’s far late now. I'm someone never liked big crowds anyways i've pretty much exact stuff COVID, legitimate excuse it. Still hope gets cured see people follow happy again. Still remember sitting saying masks work. Remember? 2020, took long find science basic knowledge masks Asia like Japan ect.. least came around still strange. Also virus ""rides"" aerosols particles bigger virus itself, air (mostly inside). remember said mostly ""droplet spread"" falls things. know spring, cases may many-fold test statistics. bad things even still wear mask. They'd starve death. It’s article. Swedish government puppet regime Swedish oligarchs? clue, thanks explaining me, spread among friends hopefully start revolution. 


Edit: would Löfven, illegaly, make nationwide lockdown anyway? wanted say im grateful updates. Thank you! bother much? emphasis drama... bothers you... possible overdose, really hard unwillingly. getting pills, need get 50 pills day weeks see side-effects. taking droplets, need consume entire bottle every single day effect. say 'nobody start taking consulting' need 'carefully monitor levels' dramatic exaggration, especially easy access tests doctors. large safe take least 1000 IU day regardless present levels.

edit: [some understand safety parameters therapeutic vitamin supplementation, important know 10,000-25,000 IU/day made skin response adequate sunlight 1934 1946, supraphysiological doses vitamin (25(OH)D) used treatment rheumatoid arthritis (200,000-600,000 IU/day),[6] 60,000-300,000 IU/day asthma[7] 100,000-150,000 IU/day tuberculosis.[8] However, months supplementation doses, hypercalcemia often appeared,[6,7] reports resultant deaths.[9,10] Subsequently, much smaller doses vitamin used treat rickets, limited 200 units per day.[11]

so overdose levels much higher possible take d3 oral supplementation. That's entire story though. I'm diagnosed schizoaffective, borderline personality disorder used call sociopath. still wear mask. Still, wearing mask largely question self preservation - even die covid, still want get sick help it.

In defense, I'm therapy struggling kind person still recognize temptations. know psychological tendencies ruined social professional life. want connect people hated mistrusted but...well long walk back hell. can’t “get roommate” live studio apt. You’re trivializing real problems others government actions actually good thing. How’s living Ireland? Here's I'm saying.

Let's say 3 people: bartender two patrons. bartender one patron willing accept risk exposed COVID, patron not, who's right say, ""If want deal rules/lack rules, stay home""? 

There's two mindsets: patron bar potentially exposing others COVID must wear mask, patron bar making choice potentially exposed COVID right force others wear mask. one mindset wrong right? total lack empathy caring anyone self. twisted world. higher increases it’s quite sweeping argument.

The seven day rolling average October 26 1,331. week October 19 822. That's 61.9% increase one week.

On June 08 seven day average 864. week June 01 seven day average 634. That's 36.3% increase one week.

I deeper dive found one period increase higher - beginning epidemic, couple weeks.

Since then, even testing expanded include many people, never increase high last report four days total

What? get idea talking four day total?

Here numbers latest spreadsheet FHM:

  23/10/2020	1870
  24/10/2020	1478
  25/10/2020	516
  26/10/2020	922

1,870 total Friday - single day, like said. total four days actually 4,786, total seven days ending October 26 9,319.

The current total reported FHM 115,785. means 8% cases reported FHM occurred last seven days. even real total lag reports expect last day increase current reported number. road-trip year Fossil Rim outdoor/drive-thru zoo hour west Dallas 1 month ago. Mask wearing 50% gas-station nearby. near north Dallas, seems around 99%. measures Switzerland didn’t help much sadly. Looks like lockdown may necessary. over, ever hear Zoom again, soon. Fuck Zoom. mask wearers 2 callous/hostile/deceitful scale non masks 5? opinionated puff piece villainizing people don’t know. 

This borderline propaganda used create community self policing binary decision. 

Media used exacerbate divided population. “statistics” say green eyed people transmit covid higher rate, see malignant behavior towards group. 

Social commentary without statistical analysis emotionally driven divisive control. Right, I'm saying anecdotal experience increase gatherings (which moving indoors) alongside masklessness events. That's good way spread airborne disease.

I agree opening bumped numbers quarantine exhaustion breeds complacency restlessness. insidious voice says, ""oh bad kids really want see friends."" ""Oh big deal, let's go watch game bdubs."" plenty people worried compliant start getting relaxed. Winter going rough go again. Source?

The article says 47% control group deficiency... selfish Fuck wanked, feel bad children grow around Yep. feel lucky decent job right fucking sucks.

Every day bleeds next endlessly. get up, go work, come home watch TV gf play video games, repeat. one hand march feels like decade ago hand summer slipped blink. fucking feel nothing tired numbness evert single day. look graphs. article great it’s week old. graphs states hospitals filling look like exponential growth me. hope I’m reading wrong you’re right. *They think gonna happen them, they're ones spared*

That it, nutshell. 

What scary there's lot narcissists thought. don’t say? lol idea federal government literally anything besides confirming conservative supreme court justice know couple asthmatics get bad reaction masks. however keep distance even wear mask absolutely can't keep distance . encourage others wear masks. One probably already covid early February seems suffering long term effects. also worried could re-infected since current strain mutated wears mask can. Brave That's intent get people planes, limit covid get call party death. would curfews anything? hospitals overrun

Define overrun. mean ICU's full patients turned back, mean many hospital staff infected virus? Exactly. one claims willing die country, willing follow basic orders like wear mask stand six feet apart get boot camp ass intact first nursing job US, Chief Nursing Officer threw statistic third new grad nurses leave profession good year 2.

For facility, right. elderly virtue older often confined indoors tend vitamin deficient. also greatest risk hospitalized COVID-19. Yes I’m aware studies going it’s long long way ever approved even considered approval. 

Doesn’t mean want beta tester. Also one stop prevent so. 

Even bad decision, decision free make. It’s funny facts FBI government websites offend you/. It’s also really cute blindly follow movement give zero shits you. Also, hate Trump don’t support BLM. TLDR: 16 new imported cases, 0 new domestic cases, 24 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 26 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

We've states generally closed here. contact tracing comes in.

New Zealand also come freight (probably) dealt short regional lockdown contact tracing. Even lockdown may overkill.

So far seems key cases low single digits + effective contact tracing, latter Victoria failed. Holy shit, me? kinda matter. Spanish Flu got really bad second wave. wave simpler way say factors mentioned increasing wave like manner. statistic taken completely context. believe study referencing long covid patients 18% studied admitted hospital. exageration. probability organ damage going higher known long covid patient. 

Furthermore 18% younger people admitted hospital. Idaho? True. Also senators grabbed money themselves. appear nation's best interest mind. surprising. friend’s brother family recently moved there. told loves cuz one wears mask wants whole family move there. course 70 year old parents wear masks careful, wouldn’t even visit. funny/sad thing masks wearing comment said good thing brag. Btw, grew Houston. clearly racist ""all lives matter"" believer I'm wasting time arguing someone uses data fit narrative. quarantined beginning year, worked months summer, got sick two months quit.

Been home ever since.

In lucky enough fucking die paycheck. Fuck choice. one make it. majority population want this

How Biden leading popular vote polls majority population want cautious restriction approach? ""The need vaccine still large, data change that."" would continue taking vaccine? Thankfully, think they're minority among friends. Still, who'll swear blind Bill Gates's attempt microchip everyone. wanted absolute, bare-minimum thing could do. Absolutely ridiculous. state (UT) never point cases declined, we’ve ago reliably increasing rate entire time. That's still statistically significant compared believed factual counterarguments incivility? Well, brainwashed blame....Obama? Clinton? Pelosi? OAC?

It matter. never blame people actually hurting them. Israel China pretty good relations, far I'm aware. Maybe legitimate trade they've decided keep things 'unofficial' Mossad avoid antagonising Americans? Almost year bad news, never enough. another article saying: oh people depressed.  Sometimes yes, mostly no, think that's starting change little proud Victoria! You’re achieving places Earth able to. Statistically black people likely low income systemic racism thus jobs deemed essential must work. parties. racism opinion. facts bother you? It’s proven statistics. 17th worst  Ya, there's definitely poor people crime China... Lmao judge US worst areas China fantasy. Put muzzle back on. Thanks, I'm trying. ordinarily cared less, eat breathe right next people survival important ours. truly wish case addition civil cultural differences Asian countries still understand real oppression feels like. We’ve free west long, black Americans notwithstanding, us confuse cooperation sacrifice losing freedoms. 

When world normal equilibrium group losing something it’s probably another group taking away. isn’t that. disease taking us. We’re trying minimize it. requires everyone changing like they’re used to. world full lockdown since beginning pandemic? didnt know guy everyones listen herd might wildly march.. lets hope... probably not. politicizing bit hard cover full hospitals dead people. moot point. give shit ""wave"" in. bad. all. Kids don't? Dude none us do. least kid nievety wouldve made problems ""oh learn online"" 

Every single adult half brain stuck going poor hungry, slaving away paycheck get sick debilitated six months. 

For alot reasons, children cannot grasp issues actually facing reason easier time.  NJ state highest population density. actually crucial vaccinate quickly possible. Spread get hand easily, especially significant number commuter communities. 

There likely enough, but, hopefully, get functional government understands population dense communities higher risk, especially since isolation difficult sick. priority cities population dense areas. Rural communities natural advantage slowing spread. Oh wow. see I'm going engage. find link study page(may overseen it). 
 
Anyways - among young coronavirus hospital-patients, guess expected. 
If among less severe cases patients sent back home rest, sounds pretty dramatic me. time go even higher shelf! can’t name another country would wrong statistics

Yup. can't name another country wrong. Europe massively outperformed US. nice day little buddy. Try blow blood vessel raging one. huh? He’s correct They've kept yapper shut last week, kept claiming week statistically first interim analysis. that's horrible. Exhaled respiratory droplets larger virus made painfully obvious world prepared handle global emergency,

I disagree. Covid made plainly obvious world fully prepared handle global pandemic, utilizing methods would otherwise find distasteful. problem youre look everyone, shouldnt be: people intended saved protected first place. 

Dont forget month news sources America even discussing real problem, US senators selling stock en masse informing inner circles come. rich powerful arent dying. None die.

All death chaos isnt due lack preparation. feature. Sure I'm also saying physically impossible.

Some states thousands state border crossings. like states countries. would literally impossible it. Ohio needs worry sounds crazy read literally hope there's context missing. SCMP site unusable mobile. link study? Never leaders lawyers businessmen.

You cannot negotiate covid, there’s gotcha wording, doesn’t fucking care. Don’t know still ppl think got COVID, would immune like trump. Testing VIC upwards 10k people day. recording high numbers (700 positives day) testing numbers even higher. NSW (shares border VIC cases spread NSW Victoria's outbreak) testing 10k people day returning &lt;20 positives day. 

Anyone requests test one. Victoria health dept knocked door every home hotspots ask people take test, symptomatic otherwise. also depend US Mexico food supply. Particularly winter months prairies covered snow, 40 nothing grows.

So matter going trucker trains coming US Canada. food distributed east west. mean like white people get shot black people police yet black people act like they’re people get killed police media? I’m mad. can’t name another country would wrong statistics. still answered initial question proof started moving goal posts proven wrong. always use word “literally” comments understand means? 5 15145 total positives Laredo He's wrong. People need see front start taking seriously better throw away brain. always use one account. could tell would checked it, stupid ass. smaller seed count matters gives time react bring R back down, actually use time ya matter. rewriting history, Eastern Europe locked even first death, less 100 cases. assume bad colds normal hard case flu. I've flu twice. first worst second time rough staying hydrated. Flu sucks anyone saying flu surely hit hard enough flu.  Wow never realized Mexico’s population much smaller US. yeah probably tricky results limited testing Seattle look pretty optimistic I've read (and possibly summer tourism proved too?). Luckily protesting women even ask counter-protesters wear masks that's great. I'm quite optimistic despite fact apparenly covid still well understood.  Thank time traveler. Yeah, no.

First off, really need vaccinate elderly high-risk groups, hospitals fine danger strained. virus spread around younger, healthier people, still serious cases, people get little sick recover. 

Second, even goal vaccinate everyone, society would take another year masks distancing. There’s general consensus I’ve noticed among people they’ll go along measures winter, spring summer hit weather gets warm again, goes window. One year enough, people want lives back. Big businesses paid lobbyists, small business don't. protect airborne virus completely, fluids. make great point. rich, stocks, feel pain, inclined help. love life returned normal April go things crowded places without worrying killed maimed highly infectious disease. really- check today reported 38k new cases . absolute basis, almost DOUBLE less france per capita basis almost TWENTY times less France. Way lower EU/.Canada moment. Indias total deaths 119,355 almost half US one lowest per capita world.

There definitely miscounting cases, deaths etc overall trend huge decline. second wave doesnt happen India would pretty much kept control end year Early 2021. personal experience amount infections India huge(really huge)-By know close 10-15 people infected India. Multiple antibody studies show close 300 million people infected. Another important point India largely open past month (including theatres malls reduced capacity). 

There definitely regional/genetic/hidden immunity component this. Also dont forget India dire living conditions compared rest Asia. would absolutely tell someone actions actively endangering lives. isn’t elementary school bullshit. Hundreds thousands died people failing follow guidelines. Fuck everyone following rules. anyone best ignorant worst stunningly callous, selfish, cold hearted. 

Ahem, sounds like strategy Florida pursing. is. 

It’s great I’m father kids old enough Pokémon definitely remember kids HS College playing game (great game, never jam). Look, know sounds awful but, least partner, main changes really:

- sitting cafes, cafe brunches etc (Melbourne best cafe culture world big deal)
- fancy nights restaurant. every often made special effort nice dinner bottles wine.
- LOTS walks. We'd go least hour walk parkland every single day sunset.
- socialisation friends family, sucks, honestly fact everyone state going made feel bit better. Lots people sharing feelings mental health struggles IG supporting other, sorta thing.
- working home. big one us, cos partner's commute work + office environment SUCKED pre-covid. WFH amazing, sleeping in, hour commute removed way, time hang together
- usually go Europe month two every year, obviously happen year.

To add this, I'm sure many couples major stressor, partner pretty great bonding experience. NB bulk (July - October) happened cold wet winter Melbourne, time TBH time would've bunkered indoors anyhow. us, really removed maybe every two weeks beers pub mates fair bit eating restaurants. upside, we've saved shitload money normally spend pretty frivolous things, we're planning 6-12 month road trip around Aus next year proceeds.

And also saved rest Australia getting infected too. They've able lead normal life we've done. whole Aus eliminated Covid, travel bubble New Zealand set up. 

The northern hemisphere entering Winter one really knows next 6 - 12 month like. possible Australia NZ remain covid-free, absolutely worth it. sure? know measles viral vectors work despite people immune measles. Doesn’t seem obstacle. Hey also part trial.

How expect citizenship take seriously abide tough restrictions impose without reacting? Expensive study finds studies expensive. illegal got anything say trump now?  IMO, pragmatic solution would nationwide mask mandate, comprehensive testing program, strictly enforced restrictions gatherings social distance.

Hahahahahaha. love eternal Canadian optimism we'll actually learn someone else's misfortune. agree people care probably 6 8 weeks vaccine widely available populations particular country. feel like people keep wearing masks long need stop distancing lot sooner. remember back March people sub loudly confidently telling people would stop patronizing businesses without lockdown, they're afraid getting sick. Made sense time people would voluntarily stay home even bother lockdown? Anyway, state mostly open people definitely staying home they're scared get sick.

Also, sacrifice voluntary involuntary measure taken benefit others detriment. 

Getting sick sacrifice unless one folks going participate British Challenge Trials 2021. Nobody benefits person gets sick, it’s sacrifice.

So, definition, simply wrong.

Moving on, like wearing mask, fine. I, one, would rather wear mask things equal. like using facial expressions, seeing facial expressions, gauging peoples’ looks, breathing freely heavily respirating etc.

Is mask detriment? Yes
Does benefit others? Yes
Is everyone else it? Yes

It’s sacrifice. norm. norm.

This basically part text truly understand. I'm working school restarted August open whole time far, even though school 6 known cases, one teacher. Private school. New Zealand locked entire _country_ (twice!). Places like Melbourne lockdown almost _four months_. idea put list.

Vietnam cities lockdown late yesterday.

Are paying attention all? Nice Anecdotal, 6 year old crushing remote. I’m actually shocked. holy fuck. deliver early budget find funded less afforded less time. Always deliver time budget. one car, MAYBE make exception. government managed well beginning, individual people collectively made moderate efforts, that's would needed. year without concerts motorcycle rallies cruise ships would worst part it, people would still able get together small groups friends family exception maybe short quarantine waiting test result.

But government shit bed, people felt like would literally die go Sturgis, Karen stand wear scarf face, are. government helped small businesses instead large ones. reason large companies get loans. mom pop. Definitely direct quote Old news, lot changed since then.

The lockdown residential blocks last long couple weeks affected tower. Everybody allowed exercise well. got decent food supplied eventually sorted food requirements etc.

This type quarantine happens people deemed close contacts cases, still happens. case tower, anyone tested positive, entire tower deemed close contacts due facilities. Anyone tested positive give choice move hotel accommodation.

For everyone else highest level restrictions allowed get food supplies, exercise 1 hour day, visit people requiring care, go work permitted industry.

Also, half population follow best practices. love default comeback someone lost argument accuse trolling.

Your English comprehension abysmal. I've pointed numerous times border restrictions along suppression measures within country essential. clearly dumb understand oft-repeated point I've making.

Yet another strawman second paragraph. Nice one. issue hand whether border restrictions effective preventing covid transmission. And, admitted, are.

Relaxing border restrictions due general dislike internal EU borders. They're implemented deemed necessary. Finnish government, along EU governments, thought necessary anymore, hence lifted. that, obvious now, mistake.

Ah, gotta make sure get insult people visiting Finland. Ouch. I'll get though.

This whole situation must suck you, huh? Border restrictions working not. guess wait next life live world without borders. Masks everything. replacement physical distancing reducing contacts. thing masks got politicized. populist right often ignoring lack trust scientists political leaders, reaction progressives seem think masks thing matters trying manage spread day day lives.

Influenza like Coronavirus RNA virus viral envelope. equally vulnerable cleaning solutions. Houston, problem.  post death rates 😉 Haha - saw that. Pretty impressive number downvotes considering entirely reasonable opinion. Except examples societies actually care although replicate exactly, Japan New Zealand done incredible jobs, primarily leadership acted quickly citizens care part. disagree points, area opened schools way describe- masked, attempt distancing, hybrid schooling- transmission within schools looking LARGE contributing factor. think anyone accurately state factor all, amount spread less expected.

That said... community done around school open definitely helping. Sleepovers, parties, house parties, gatherings... things increased spreading. state county have, continuously, linked outbreaks personal gatherings- linked schools kids bring picked school. school outbreaks happen.

And despite pleas (the district literally made video begging parents cut social interaction outside school) new restrictions (the state limited number people gathering ten two families) one changing behavior. day new restrictions announced, kids invited two different parties, neither wedding husband invited canceled.

When parents successful convincing leadership kids needed person, took mean kids' lives disrupted. Social outlets sports ""necessary part education development"" mentally justify choices.

As long government cannot go people's homes shut parties, less less recourse. families refusing make changes, may choice close schools. want slow spread.

The option seems hear lot, ""spread amount healthy, build immunity, end sooner."" subscribe that, government battling two people groups, closing schools may last resort.

And still probably work. Borders closed again. stills pass exception list. polish citizen basically cannot get country. honest helped fact coronaviruses exactly new studied quite lot community transmission suppressed people renege suppression measures, way jumps back brought outside. PERIOD. simple fact resonate you?

It does, many countries got numbers control yet simply state borders closed relevant. That's entire point. Countries worried foreign travel right now, concern suppressing spread within country, closing borders nothing front. 

Right countries stage need get numbers control. talking border closures fix issue red herring. Full stop. talking getting domestic cases control bringing borders discussion irrelevant. 

This entire post France 52k cases one day. borders open closed would significantly changed number domestically spread. bringing border closures completely irrelevant topic domestic spreading. keep bringing America reason. NEVER GOT CONTROL. EVEN CLOSE.

Yes leader another troglodyte thinks close borders done it. that's solution domestic spreading. solution foreign spreading. foreign spreading concern vast majority countries right now, talking solutions issue countries (and one topic post) facing beyond irrelevant. Seriously, people looking ways curb spread within countries mouth breathers talking closing borders. That's tough lesson swallow. That’s true, question though countries locking better though aside maybe NZ Australia? Source? amazing feeling, thanks Victorians, we’ve done well, keep up! Taiwan, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Korea, Vietnam, figured deal virus. need lock 12 months know doing. definitely possible, although far seriously overblown much influence Trump administration able far ""rushing out"" (which probably apparent ever before, Oxford vaccine apparently progressed one all, American).

After exposed couple times coronaviruses people generally obtain affinity maturation unable infected anymore. Even reinfections common think, eventually immune system able permanently combat it. 

Even then, far likely know majority reinfections asymptomatic mild. Asymptomatic ones happening months months (all way back April Asia, dismissed poor testing long haul), one took notice severe reinfections. Keep mind virus shown produce tcell bcell responses. Subsequent infections generally less severe. everyone proper immune response well, could explain rare severe reinfections. They're also studying severe reinfections closer. dozens dozens asymptomatic/mild possible reinfections backlogs genetically tested.

All chances people infected extremely unlikely. Mild coronaviruses OC43 HKU1 showed 10% people able infected third introduction virus spaced antibodies wane (**edit:** *for record around half able infected second exposure*). mild coronaviruses invoke mild immune response SARS-CoV-2 general.

Its much likely virus becomes immunosupressed endemic disease (by vaccination acquired immunity) still circulates causing bad colds, overall mild people besides small population left zero exposure it. 

**Edit:** *When people say thing herd immunity common coronaviruses mean can't build permanent immunity it. means reinfections possible virus continues circulate population.* 

*Experts believe Russian Flu Epidemic 1889 actually caused hCov OC43 jumped cows humans genetically around region. appears killed millions caused severe disease novel virus. circulates low level endemic disease causing colds. epidemics likely caused lasted couple years.* organ damage crew at? Covid also spiking across Europe. Must awful American conspiracy theorists.  Worldometers US 8k last monday. never thought it’s even possible politicians screw it. considering island nation government willing listen science what’s best community, i’m worried Great news even get vaccine, keep wearing mask good go out. almost certainly completely effective. it’s 50 80% effective still wear mask. reality many inner city Canadian hospitals pre-COVID. well fact incredible infectious wait years outbreaks determine efficacy. find complete data extra days data, doesnot rolling average. However, comparaison purposes, good keep mind march death count slope probably quite influenced ramping testing. ""If work hard follow dreams successful.""

Easier others. Parties already happening. That's cases going dude. Yea sucks, see dozens people day wear mask, especially since evil governor Kelly mandated it. Hopefully least get Barbara Senate maybe get tighter legislation passed federal level maybe. government managed better people put things month two, that's probably would been. Sure, think excellent news. think good time come, too. I'd much rather approval happen election rather it, leave skeptics less ammo regard political influences it. want far beyond reproach possible, every possible angle, maximum number people willing take it. Quebec shithole Canada. asking would told stupid many words. I'm still assuming March 2021 Utah. Idaho. still follow restrictions except visit parents. probably go see movie social thing every then. Thank goodness vaccine around corner. asian baffled got treatments asap yet westerns countries refuse follow cause rediscover fire Sweden also among highest amounts deaths per capita Europe, really want go for. really “I don’t like it’s fake news.” That’s they’re saying. Yeah, care semantics. think third peak. thing I'm sure though going new high number cases brewing, could last Winter! would want one? Well awful lot adults never matured past childhood emotionally, guess true. bitching countries Sweden, never let come lol Given vaccines, rule unlikely scenarios. I'll gladly change tune data shows otherwise, I'm going tell someone ""yes, vaccine means good whatever"", especially likely coming back check recent data following administration vaccine. Miss one dog 6cases amazing. schools closed except small percentage disabilities deemed necessary school. buildings huge it’s small percentage people guess “safe”. Even get email nearly week one students tested positive anyone spent 15 minutes room must also quarantine. I’m shocked often we’ve received emails. far none students contracted other, they’re bringing them. haven’t heard severe either. think many cases it’s family member tested positive kid get tested well. Good call. I've noticed too. like discussing covid find really interesting fuck place one depressing corners reddit sometimes lol Holy fuck restrictions horrifying.

My state similar population 3x deaths (83 average death age), live like goddamn world war going on. Yeah... get unwrap though. Unless happen doctor person high distribution priority list. called Two Santas method. remember late February early March Iran got outbreak parliament members state officials got virus. Economist published article saying Iran's government fumbled response caused infections government members. commented could true US take seriously, bunch 'muricans certain ... ""viewpoint,"" replied back, saying comment age like milk.  


Turns became vintage wine. Five locale, around time? go again. Stay safe people Actually, every country seems conspiracies around covid. Israel, Netanyahu using covid lockdowns distract corruption trial. thread month ago people different countries shared country's conspiracies w covid. live Kansas? know scientists policymakers, right? can't go playground? law are? really hospitals dedicated COVID hospitals dedicated everything else. cross-contamination risk high sick weak it. message coming top chain. that's it. 100% administrations fault are. everyone following example. US far 299,000+ Looks like wrong haha. dudes, he's clout. need, daily deaths bottomed 2 weeks ago. Three weeks ago Trump told everyone ""not afraid virus ... let control life.""

We seeing direct result message. People decided pandemic longer something worry about, surge. Theyll keep spouting ""99% survival rate"", wait family member accident heart attack needs kind non-covid related emergency care, get turned away hospitals full. Maaaaybe they'll see curbing spread important. Certain jobs pretty strict medical requirements. Say pilot pro athlete. 

Genuinely curious, would process creating job required certain anti-bodies? IMO anyone anti-bodies work right ridiculous travesty. extremely valuable asset. hiring minimum wage servers, paying six figures work front lines vulnerable areas - nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, etc. couple younger dudes w 2B plates live apt complex blue lives stickers vehicles, &amp; recently license plates dirty-sticky w appeared maybe tape covering numbers, they're always giving dirty looks walk dog wearing mask.

IOW, know that; might visit Emmett Council drive check out. might surprised Trumpy demographic there; young dumb Pepé frog/government smashing lulz.

Edit: also, grew Kuna, might little naïve 😝😘  want virus appear less dangerous is.

Take Ryquell Armstead. guy starting RB NFL, he’s indefinitely Covid. aren’t really sharing much. Can't second wave never finish first context!!! even count now.. Yeah, imagine really frustrating/disheartening see perspective.

I kind think it’s human nature focus dramatic/bad things instead mundane positives - it’s cable news way is, it’s stories COVID deniers outbreak events get far attention provably deserve. Sensationalism sells. mixed Reddit userbase’s toxic “US bad” obsession makes pretty poor combo. 

Ultimately, wild opinions get upvoted Reddit reflect tiny vocal minority real world. always try remember that. Umm drop patients hallways Canadian hospitals time. literally line every hallway days way ambulance triage main emergency

This new  There'd nothing average people bill IIRC. direct payments, thing interested protecting corporations ignore safety laws employees inevitably start dying Covid.

Honestly, past ticking point. bomb going moment. Covid literally *nothing* compared climate change. 

The world shocked decade 2 see first mass migration densely populated region became uninhabitable due climate change. wake call needed decades ago, course it'll late then. Countries fall existential crisis either fresh water dries countries upstream closed dams. Wars begin issue dams fresh water, almost certainly.

And world acting like everything fine dandy. going brutal wake call. 2014 Ebola revealed stupid people were.

there poll...i forget where....where ebola crisis, americans overwhelmingly favored banning food imports countries facing ebola crisis.

just one problem.

you get ebola food. Wow great argument dumbass. 12137 July 22nd. Today 3859. Thought Chad? Also Ohio, live PIB. Watched 0 tourists wear marks social distance here. They've ignoring it.  government everything prevent virus exploding first place. Ive poland 1 month ago ones blame people itself.

Also dont expect much polish healthcare system. cant turn piece coal gold. knew, thats closed country early. Shame you.

The initial poster said 'whining [that] *want* go ... party'. Chill. Nice try Eric know bad articles NPR downvoted hurt get tested? Might well Lol! one practice burning paper goods ancestors.

it's traditional rather superstitious, know scientifically make sense gives us peace mind. one time Europe absolutely coordinate work together

Uh.. remember migrant crisis? EU countries started bussing migrants across countries drop next border. wanted open province weekend got 817 cases. Way higher first wave. Cool, didn’t plans 2025. less 3% USA's population confirmed infected long way go. Even double cover un-diagnosed asymptomatic cases, there's still huge numbers people may get sick, lingering side effects die. 

Europe exploding extraordinary numbers too. Welcome Reddit Ew! accurate. lmao point stands Biden winning change much everyone there's long list countries official COVID numbers fuck knows excess deaths. hilarious people think demanding whole society remodelled order alleviate personal anxiety inability cope potential mortality actually altruistic thing do, even hundreds millions people go hungry, lose year social life head towards decade economic depression.

Looking forward crossing border shopping sight seeing.

Trump company sabotage economy lame duck period ensure Biden inherits worst economy since great depression, half spite, half thier 2024 playbook.

Hell, even dems take senate, presidency, retain house - somehow Republicans find way filibuster reasonable stimulus. 

Meanwhile 10s millions Americans slip black hole poverty, worse - homelessness desperation. richest continue get richer whole mess, regardless thier policital party.

Uhhh, no. science pretty clear point. Sounds right Americans honestly Every day opinion differs subject. One day articles heralding strong long lasting immune response, next day articles like one come opposite conclusion.

Much covid gone way. One day airplanes safe, next flying petri dishes. One day masks work, next don't. One day children low risk vectors unlikely catch spread covid, next driving huge surge infections.

What going on... believe?

Easy stop believing science.  exactly civilized part Alabama? I’m curious. People comply hospitals begin overflow start publishing triage plans. read reddit social distancing harmless, healthy easy follow everyone. Well good quality diaper would keep in, eventually going leak out. course you’ll want change diaper regularly, you’re full shit, outside could contaminated peoples' shit. It’s basic common sense don’t want reuse dirty diaper improperly worn diaper leaves asshole clear view world isn’t going contain shit blowhole erupts like whale breaching. No. Biden pointed out, federal mask mandate likely unconstitutional. 

And mandate ruled unconstitutional, would embolden people declare mandates restrictions unconstitutional. 

You may aware recent news surrounding Supreme Court. lot confidence federal mask mandate would result domino effect that, long term, would greatly erode state local authority enforce social distancing. enforcement? Think maskless people sitting courts contest fine spreading. Extremely difficult? Really? look chart &lt;insert European right und tell extremely difficult see clear waves. see many people concerned flu season even possible ""twindemic"" (even though flu caused major problems like covid-19 even know people saying that) given fact people social distancing, wearing masks going less, much relaxed flu season? mention people get flu shot get year (me included, would never get cause always gives parents terrible symptoms time I'm getting it), we've already seen that, flu cases compared last year several parts world. Yes, one wants US citizens country right now. think lot shows much American Democracy built hope/assumption people (especially PoTUS) would generally abide rules traditions governing bodies (especially Senate) would intervene someone got line. assumptions don’t hold Oh, please, shitwater hoax! Anyone gets pool sheeple! evil. They're*

And yes are. great news! Maybe! really dive US state specific stuff US, entirely possible talking states within discussions otherwise nationally focused blurred together memory. possible, explain fact populations seeing disproportionally high rate growth comparison populations compromised younger people. would think younger people communities suddenly see spike weeks similarly aged people communities did.

Another hypothesis might young people communities socially similar old people, young people tend live communities like would likely less people socialize value socialization less. time really change end take away much? pandemic spreading isolated populations, less social young people old people whatever.

Or, could seems old people indeed getting often now. trend see infection, takes root exposed populations (young social people) gets vulnerable populations later. Weed Humans general rights like freedom movement freedom association. kinda sucks Chinese vaccines though tested EU USA.. know, thread shocking. usually come see sad sacks coping. pleasant change. Every school district pretty much back person part. playing constant game whack mole though, one school opens two schools shut 3-5 days. amount community spread playing game probably incalculable. appears schools across country (for part) open business.

Well reality snapping back, last week they'll get rest winter. city rest nation able save businesses letting stay open like longer. lack cohesive federal response annihilating capability economic survival. winter soon forget. He’s wrong whatever Lolllllll [And People simply refuse listen. Man know mean, actually going park regularly I've become wary people even think staying 6 feet away Covid personified? symptoms covid (female / 19) cant get tested right isnt testing center city can't take public transport.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* THANK DR FAUCI! exactly *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks — something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you’re alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. That’s definitely true lately, actually written Chief Business Editor, surprisingly free babysitting people, could care less education. Jesus shit again. really complete fucking dipshit failed grasp last 7,000 times people carefully explained US number annualized number way comparable actual % change reported countries? fact US number happens almost exactly 4 times Aussie number 4 quarters year didn’t jump peculiar? fucking stupid possibly be? I’ve taken shits brain cells you. US Olympics-sized

What's that? expecting access vaccine 2021? see reason go large gatherings vaccinated. Ha ha ha ha ha *cries* lot people already have

Yes, see fast increasing daily covid numbers. shit teeth. **compared America. stay inside 24/7, agree! guess I’m trying optimistic. haven’t hugged friends family 9 months. It’s really rough. sure curb virus considering whole point / post people something theyre (&amp; compared one word another), yes NPR afraid looked biased give airtime shitty people days lie. MD’s Utah well places predominantly atheist/agnostic. want Mormon bishops, you’ll find dentists plastic surgeons. No, it’s useless misleading measurement.

Drunk driving deaths cause 0.003% deaths nationally, doesn’t mean isn’t dangerous stupid. point I'm ready might-harm-me vaccine will-definitely-kill-me virus. lungs would probably hold Covid. Thank god practicing medicine. husband work hospital, will

I updated original post something found healthcare provider's portal. Says antibodies could potentially last years, like said, mean detectable. look find information specific test administered. vocabulary mistake change anything point? FDA already shot Drumpfs attempts bypass new thorough approval procedures luckily also well nordic country much smaller population population density. still worse neighbours. kidding? mean there's dangerous potentially-deadly situation going &amp; unsure official messaging maybe best take 'better safe sorry' approach instead throwing hands &amp; acting like people can't imagine months without brewpub outing can't figure left right parents risk children dying kids lazy login online class? 

It's bad enough normal classes kids take teacher's time behavioral issues kids actually want learn sit wait. need hold everyone else back match weakest students. 

It's sad kids come disadvantaged backgrounds, risk child's life score woke points. talking USA? first wave never ended, second. Cases low? paying attention? fucking April time decided lock schools full. We're pretty much fucked. since buying vaccine, best case develop 6 8 months big players Creek least July. Sorry dude got serious tunnel vision going on. Ok. People's lives ones COVID cremated buried single plots cemeteries. think dumped mass graves.

You're ass hole. gotta disrespectful like that?

You're talking people loved ones, acting like putting mass graves good way punish COVID deniers. fuck dude. Thanks! take Vitamin (35micrograms), omega 3, biotin normal multivitamin day.
I kinda hoped vitamin would keep getting infected next to. staying home much possible mask / hand sanitizer , hope save long term damage end positive covid. Maybe complain masks thousand times people magically start wearing them. fr I’m similar field term wave exactly ambiguous. really sure it’s even point contention tho doesn’t really matter either way downvoted posting facts... I’m sorry! sounds scary! hope okay! hear lot feel guilty. virus real negative impact me. Sure, masks kind annoying don’t get see friends family bas much/in groups/inside benefits working home normalized far outweighed drawbacks.

My wife good jobs don’t kids yet though know situation minority. right really ain’t bad tbh. fever last night I’m good right now. I’m experiencing bit cough head hurts certainly bad lyin ass Fox News made believe 😂💯 Anxiety got graph you. true logical way represent data without downplaying exagerating it: video explaining it: looking graph watching video challenge still call three little blips ""waves"" comparison countries graph like Germany Italy.

The U.S. good India Brazil (which saying much all). cannot seem find eject button yet. little kid, burning paper pretty cool. probably continue burning paper thought, dad parents, maybe he'd like even actually matter seem like thought much either. folk regions across east southeast asia unorganized amalgamation sorts regional folk religions smashed together Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism (probably more). Even far less organized Buddhism. Oral tradition. paper burning, incense, plates fruit maybe occasionally chicken. can't enforce correctness, every family seemed things bit different. think folk religions make much religious China, Japan, Vietnam kind centralization cult like swings like hating masks Hoping hug wish mazeltov person. I'm glad found right one her. It’s sad!!  Reminds us Us lucky..didn’t need hospital ships field hospitals set available quickly! Hopefully find solution Poland. hope enough equipment people treat everyone:(. one would be? FDA announced would 60% meeting last week dumb take made post semantics couldnt even take 3 seconds google words youre using?

antisocial like, murderers sacrifices made early enough sufficient period time. ppl right complain corona “fatigue” masking distancing everyone else behave like lemmings Nah, we’re better / rest now. varies week week who’s worse.

And we’re definitely better Poland right now, despite Poland mandatory mask usage (and curfews iirc) Well right dismissed fallacy completely. vaccines.  I've going back forth idiot now. fairly obvious internal suppression measures (masks, distancing, lockdown) border control necessary get things control given country. suppression measures going limited use people carrying covid keep entering country. fact he/she understand much pathetic. best part is, live country perfect example this. imposed border controls along suppression measures got daily infection rates single digits summer. government decided loosen border controls - stunner - we've got hundreds cases day now. like virus spontaneously generates damn cities. That, increase international travel. guys opening success story somehow means places opened saw teachers students getting sick covid happen? words, nothing change numbers keep rising.  no, ""just keep schools closed"" viable solution


Counterpoint: Online education would worth trying 4 months. 


We gave even gave good faith try, spiking disease numbers likely imply school reopenings lead community transmission. Take Vitamin right away, many studies support vitamin sufficiency related good Covid outcomes (though need take long time raise level, hurt start now). Also may well try Vitamin C Zinc, also often taken much evidence backing up. I'm sorry yer ma, though, never heard people affected flu like before.

Edit;that's asked first place. would guess big fear anyone flu like symptoms may quarantine since similar covid, also anyone covid like symptoms may think flu go normal business. Japan actually contact tracing? opposed US. laugh deserve get. isn’t infection rate us coming from, tho. Man, agree. Namely Greg way popular name Chad amongst caucasians 😉 lot people around could give shit less. Flooding stores, least half wearing masks wearing chin diaper, they'll even take talk you! People act like NEEEEEEEEED shit stores every waking moment day order survive pandemic. Absolutely ridiculous. Thanks president Cunt whole thing utter nonsense. Painting 340 million people broad brush - defined worst among - productive way look world. horrors describing indeed terrible. terrible many imagine. many struggles difficult them. insensitive dismiss issues simply oppressive regime brutalizing people extreme example exists. reason cant.

Stop feeding trope somehow Australia accomplished lack land border another country.

That almost nothing going here. substantially worse Scandinavian neighbours, killed tons elderly people, still worse neighbours. applaud Good job Victoria!!! believe live 'bubble' wilderness. Would nice though!

I've flu times. never issue. I'm sick shite couple weeks that's that. Done. never looked flu never reason to. grew up, flu never issue unless old frail fuck perhaps case disease would fuck anyway.

I'm talking covid flu all, merely enquiring flu shots. United States believe underestimating effectiveness US military. absolute weirdos disproportionately invest money military versus people/science. once, may finally reap benefit. vaccine developed, uncertainty product ready best believe logistics problem west get dealt with.  distribution problem goes face-to-face fearsome military machine history man. I've telling coworkers months. seen real DECREASE cases large long enough break first wave, slowed times we're still rise. fucking absurd. It’s like miracle. It’ll float away. Schools daycare. kind attitude one wants teacher. Mexico pretty large population boom 1950-80. 

But Mexico never able meet even match US military economic power reason. Europe America dominated 19th CE vast populations. 1950s, Latin America's populations comparably tiny. know, one time people coordinate work togther, hear still saying covid blown proportion hoax... smart

No, experienced. vote Greg 100%. Old hatreds die hard. know frid  thought Kyle Kevin. That's true especially exhaling, need protect eyes, too. yes want pay taxes. don’t want pay even shitty GND pie sky socialist garbage think makes sense economically illiterate Asia includes India south east asia well covid19.

the post talking countries good covid19 response term low death rate, attributed lower life expectancy. 

so look countries good response got those.
if want compare UK response India, go it. UK wants sink low countries without proper toilet home, fine me. Colonavirus. flu vaccine many years iterations even 80-90% effective

also google says measles vaccine 93% effective one 97% two doses again, many years improved get point?

i aware phase 2 results written yet. could link one read effective was? think bad, wait US military gets sent war, group politicians, fight enemy that's Iraq COVID common cold. cost hubris, denial dysfunction pandemic might lost lives, cost problems war, real war, loss everything.

And think war hypothetical, idea close inevitable 3rd phase first wave Everyone must watch new documentary called ‘Totally Control’. ~ “Filmed secret five months, Totally Control uses news footage interviews experts government whistleblowers show administration missed opportunity either stop virus arriving U.S. prevent spread. filmmakers present events rapid, blow-by-blow succession, lending doc urgency contrasts languid federal response pandemic.”

Here’s link 

[Totally Control it’s also available Hulu Prime. Got em.  YSK events last 7 months created huge fucking backlog patients things relating Covid. hospitals strained right something would seriously wrong. compliance lol. people ""can't handle it"" never really could. vaccine, coupled continuation public health measures like face masks social distancing, could help move US towards “some form normality” middle next year.

A shag shag shag.

Edit: deep carpet, shag shag shag shag. 8 months still first wave? Fking hell. good news vaccines looking promising. (Still bad winter)

We making Oxford vaccine Victoria. occurred today maybe given position supplying production USA Europe. seems need much others now. bro ppl gonna criminal record forgot put piece cloth face read article linked. virus spreads easier gets colder even thrived cold enivornments

When winter hits guys see cases rise too. quickly. (unless vaccine).  Yeah it’s extraordinary turnaround! country I’m aware made huge comeback Singapore, reporting around +1000 new cases single digits. quite +0

Edit - also remember reading interview one Australia’s public health officials made similar comparison  Careful, much Brain Force Plus &amp; colloidal silver make people kinda paranoid. That's something understand hey. flu cold legit destroy older person's life, immune compromised person.

Why enforcing hygiene distancing policies pre-covid? mass use masks pre-covid?

I'm honestly ashamed ever viewed asian countries widespread used masks dubious/questioning light. neighbors relatives time. Please let out! uh... house Alaska, totally going hike Banff... I'm glad around fought WW2, would probably lost able sacrifice! 

The world fire moment loser, kids going make sacrifices like rest us. guess happy teachers sick enmasse dead? hey, long little Billy gets education hell everyone else. Australian government willing provide income citizens would normally earning via tourism, whereas US gov largely unwilling financially support individuals businesses stop business, leaving little choice. mention healthcare tied employment US, Americans enough saved live even want stop working curb spread What? Plenty suburban districts back hybrid model TLDR: Coronavirus Test Positive? Probably Shouldn’t Be. hyperbole even wrong later “no shit” news network, cats cute. ever taught? There’s way properly. Dang!! True, sad :( US one country... agree able return way that's safe, school districts large (in places) well funded Chicago Public Schools is...very difficult impossible.

I'm lucky enough rural area (which problems) employ hybrid model really limits amount students classroom amount days per week.

However, bad look even come table. least discuss it! agree. probably won't. try Minimally-educated people low social conscience making pandemic worse.

If keep kids school help create minimally-educated people low social conscience. response future events even worse.  spreading fuck getting at? want pay taxes? job adult? generically speaking new vaccine coming market. 

in case, yes based old research, research stagnant worked consistently long. also one primary vaccine candidates company that's never previously gotten stage 1 trials. hopefully breakout vaccine haha, think people get bit overly hopefully immediacy vaccine, fast roll out, effective be, etc likely whatever get improved significantly course next years Reddit dumb understand making generalizations like terrible way thinking good way piss decent people off. Yeah, one would describe CPS salaries shit pay risk age extremely low, female also correlated better outcomes. looking additional supplements, preliminary evidence favor melatonin, relatively mild sleep aid worst case scenario help Covid improve sleep quality, help anxiety immune systems. Take care. one idea would apply US. possibly millions lost livelihoods, ""slipping"" extreme poverty country safety net for-profit healthcare system bankrupt get sick. I'm sure none stressors would compound negative effects prolonged isolation. Everyone terrible situation, fuckin pandemic. least dead disabled. Child care lot important society average educators true normal vaccines? Maybe true flu, there’s lot factors going that. Vaccines like measles 99% effective. There’s way knowing right now, way virus works given responses we’ve seen phase 1 2 trials, essentially vaccines look like they’ll effective side. Hooo spicy like this. elaborate hackiness? Fountainhead broken premise pretty bad Id kinda like beat proverbial horse. like never public pool... Aside analogy, I've numerous public pools years regularly seen kids wearing diapers public pool.

I guess helped hotels lot lockdown. recently national holiday normal hotels (the ones used quarantine) full tourists again. wonder cost effective hotels remain quarantine only. local government must sort deals them. posted photo ta fair. mean SF carnival GG park anyway? Literally morons coming spread fucking covid. \*forever huge surge Covid-19 Europe probably unrelated lol!!! exactly government horrible Glad see someone else taking similar approach me. marathon, sprint. Tldr? Fucking thank Fauci! never lock down. We've trying appeal people's common sense America close useless would take 10 years trump one. Especially laughed Making mitigation debate mask wearing brilliant move part shitty politicians want actually anything. bother coherent strategy put blame onto individuals?   good know target. 

i guess thing ""first generation vaccines made quickly"" current vaccine candidates based decade research SARS coronaviruses never used. mean ""normal vaccine""? That’s it’s gonna go whether like Common brother chance. really going listen lying news media stay quarantine like kinda pansy? concur. Yeah. half loaf split amongst cronies crumbs poor people. guess, suspect person actually San Francisco. Lot people flooding various city subs say stuff like people talk Covid death rate, they're talking number people died virus, percentage state country's total population.

Going [first set numbers found Ohio 200,000 cases 5,200 deaths 2.6% death rate. You’re correct. There’s always possibility outcome like that, given factors you’ve stated well observed evidence Southern Hemisphere don’t think it’s lightly. It’s gonna particularly great winter it’s gonna worst case scenario fucking stupid part single lily pad won’t cover whole fucking pond  I’m saying spring summer, virus still still threat. It’s going away people tired it.

The virus sets timeline, us. vaccine isn’t going completely eradicate society. Oh that’s point. whole bunch governors (since federal government useless) basically said “you need wear masks social distance! Small gatherings spread virus” walked away, without even looking countries beat this. Texas, governor pretty much said “coronavirus done. sign laws protecting police limiting voting!”

It’s like, people want us social distance wear masks, it’s two way street government meet us halfway. State petition remove Covid restrictions. Going scares ever. went store yesterday amount people wearing masks giving dang way high. know people sick Covid Covid care sick not. Messaging also consistent USA because, part:

 * officials deliberately lied effectiveness masks
 * officials changed messaging masks multiple times
 * officials lied severity pandemic public saying different things private 
 * officials distributed cases continue distribute information obvious bullshit, little airborne spread
 * officials keep changing goals various painful &amp; disruptive mitigation measures
 * officials willing look way cases stuck necks promote outright risky behavior (gathering large groups protest) manner highly dependent politics group protesting 

so damn right, downvotes, explanation left ton shit out. teach high school CA; case last week another confirmed today. administration asking us seating charts see kids sit telling teachers quarantine infected kid sits within six feet teacher’s desk. 


I encouraged department hand seating charts writing tell us confirmed case room teaching. 


It doesn’t violate HIPPA. don’t tell us class. Assholes. Canadians getting $2000/month quite awhile.

Hi neighbor. I’m proud teachers staff accomplished now. students, including little ones, behaved well, according teacher friend. I’m crossing fingers winter. False. 5 months I'm Qatar. 5 Mexico. magical vaccine we’re country branded treatment therapy vaccine. Vaccines build immune system prevent infection body get it. building today anti-virals symptom-minimizers we’re calling vaccines. u get covid19 u get vaccine treat symptoms, you’re really getting vaccine—you’re getting medicine treat symptoms.

The Reason calling vaccine? calling gives hope people pint take shot never get covid19.  Want Honest fact? cures human coronaviruses vaccines human coronavirus. makes ppl think novel coronavirus something create vaccine still don’t fully know harmed others infected? able isolate individuals clusters prevent community spread places low prevalence. People wearing masks still spread catch virus. actually know effective masks are, there's never published controlled experiments. models lab simulations. That's like accident say ""Look, front got crushed airbag saved us, brake? overreacting!"" There’s point debating anyone post. Nobody cares children education. 90% people privileged selfish adults don’t care children doesn’t concern opportunity progress socially academically school without disruption. facts.

But 5000 day hardly unthinkable. That’s 100 per day per state. states stretches higher - time. gauge cautious reckless idea mean? Send up, semi experimental thing. There's literally place earth thats able mitigate virus masking alone. People overstating effectiveness become politicized issue. help substitute coherent government response. Okay, flu vaccine actually cocktail. Flu mutates *very* quickly, much much faster coronavirii. There’s incredible number flu variants different antigens running around, medicine boards look strains opposite hemisphere try select three dominant ones. There’s problems A. frequently completely miss mark strain is, B. top three strains don’t cover every single strain, C. even correct strain selected, targeted antigen change quick enough outpaced vaccine development. end getting relatively ineffective flu vaccine. Covid-19, thank god, suffer problems, least time I’m writing this. that, flu vaccine technology hasn’t really improved since 60s, haven’t major attempts so. Flu isn’t really much problem, there’s grant money improve delivery methods tech could bolster immunogenicity. Covid front runners couple outside new tech would, theory, based aforementioned results likely better producing stronger immune response. 

TL;DR comparing flu vaccine efficacy potential Covid one inappropriate comparison.

I don’t think phase 2 finished yet, readouts state immunogenicity, including antibodies that. don’t need phase 2 trial complete see vaccine produces strong immune response- it’s mostly long safety reasons. I’m away computer give couple hours I’ll get readouts Oxford, Moderna, Pfizer’s candidates- they’re strong. weird, immediately think person stubborn idiot asshole. masks. first tell us work tell us wear them. virus going anywhere. another great depression keep world running. they've known since beginning know work went 200-300 June/July 500 August 1000 September. never decline.

Correct. 200k it. 200,000 cases **REPORTED** - many people asymptomatic? numbers vary 40-60%. add too. number changes goes dramatically.

Edit: said, reading it, really look like anything major. sources seem like worried infectious diseases cause fever seem thing observed. stop,,,,,,,We can't stop,,,, nursing clinicals COVID floor .

That sounds terribly irresponsible put students work highest risk floor. still learning inevitably make mistakes part process. expected. ridiculously high stakes put students in. That's cool. I'm sorry institution short sighted careless safety. thanks Mr Lahey never mentioned Europe praised aren’t good examples. personal opinion doesn’t change factual information shows capable contact tracing Japan overall compliance wear masks distance. Healthier diet also factor don’t act like main reason Japan experienced 100x less deaths America based population. New Zealand one progressive countries world took extreme measures. Unity adherence science actually play role helping people worldwide pandemic. Wow, would guessed? People want simple answers complicated situations don’t dismiss complex time really living in. test food processing consumption though!?

All surfaces equal. good animation showing single wave spreading outwards (bottom sloppy joes night? idea! unfortunately work. idea case Covid got crazy workers left needed governmental decision. However found out, immunity goes away quick get infected again. sure second time worst. restaurant owner surely medical team back test waitress applicants see covid not. wave gets bigger. like squall. it’s lot easier 99% sub get high horse, say “masks” blame Trunp [insert politician here] virtue signal part solution.

We accept level spread “using” schools versus damn bars, absolutely agree there. Nah, could've held vaccine available or, least, rest country surging could send resources rural areas. Now, rural areas going mostly own. People see animation bottom: apparent wave travelling slowly across US.

I think NYC left first wave, may experience second wave soon. Sure redditors coronavirus subreddits making decisions based pure greed Agreed, seems though health little it. know diabetics overweight danger, anyone 75 really taking risk getting thing. immune system awfully complex. still don’t know exactly elderly much likely die thing 3 year old. There’s speculation, much more. 

I encouraged Kamala Harris younger capable. Biden gets this, guarantees.  doesn’t care helping people need help. Trust lmfao, win year. anything neighbour wins smoothbrain award.  Well streets lockdown running fever, detained. told quarantine yourself, failed, honor system didnt work you, get go field hospital. Wait what’s wrong wording? rephrase question think would better?

If think problem wearing mask, you’re wrong. strictly following public health guidelines day 1, continue even vaccine comes out. social distancing since popular. follow science, least trust isn’t politically motivated bullshit put place merely make Trump look less bad. Yeah, kidding. Eh, Melbournian here. bad. Plenty walks parks friends, lots video chats trivia beers, working home great.

Was boring say extremely tough (my opinion). see could impact people's mental health though.

Glad stayed course hopefully match states! safety pretty much assured point. efficacy we're talking  latest update quote McConnell: ""Go fuck yourselves, we've got unqualified right-wing extremist put supreme court"". hey, read article commenting Reddit! That’s cheating! study end years though People “gainz” ones dying. It’s obese ones don’t leave house mostly unhealthy. I’m sure frequenters sub fit bill, understand worry. Couple points wanted throw in. 

I think density interconnectedness Europe means virus already spread everywhere, every town village. US, places getting started, plenty places still hit. 

The reason NYC hit bad early capital world, millions travellers tourists passing through. 'Blue' states hit harder initially reason. rural 'red' states less well travelled connected virus took longer take hold. 

Viral load seems important factor outcomes. get hit lot virus immune system gets started gonna end well. That's lot medical staff dying early China Europe. wearing masks taking precautions, even infection rates high, fatalities much less April. People getting infected smaller doses virus, better chance recovery. 

A reduction deaths apparent people taking seriously. Areas people taking precautions see higher death rate. Rand Paul truly piece shit. Wait minute...

Were recently published articles making claims schools didn’t seem problem based spurious inconsistent data definitive proof shouldn’t happening?!?!

(/s dimwits) Selfishness ignorance go hand hand, got here. idea downvoted. spot on. over-reliance vaccine (to control pandemic) wise,” said Stephen Griffin, Leeds University associate professor medicine.

You mean this? wonder he’s talking need keep social measures control? Touché. puts anal analogy. Thank you! 
I'm physiologist sort hopefully someone else chime in. Weird reported symptoms seem correlate organ misbehaving. pretty typical symptoms anyone longer-than-usual-term viral infection. think little dramatic use phrasing like ""organ damage""/""organ impairment"" something like enlarged spleen (and others) totally reversible often temporary long-lasting consequences. can't really compare straight total positives. count reinfections 90 days, subtract every positive last 90 days, everyone died 90 day window obviously can't get reinfected. Especially USA head government actively tried downplay discredit crisis. left county decision. democratic governor republican state- hard get stuff done. Stay home order name only. 1st one never enforced Let's classify covid STD since semen it. wouldn’t phrase like that. person also said, it’s hospitals etc control spread, rather it’s government top also giving health sector enough funding.

I live Denmark, Fox called socialist nightmare before, healthcare system handling COVID load fine, non-covid issues treated usual (however maybe wait longer).

Socialized healthcare, least here, great. use one card check doctors, book time online, get library pick (subsidized) prescriptions. Also, there’s cap 500$ year prescriptions, government pay everything 500$ altogether. system bit slow sometimes, however recent years government put money systems biggest need (like psychiatry) overall system functions well. it’s perfect, Denmark issues, we’re good example socialized healthcare excellent. need good politicians control it.

If poland addressed healthcare deficiency years ago like have, improving facilities wages, wouldn’t issue. Writing job hospital work mental health unit (different state, though). Hopefully things starting turning around all. discussed. schools even way properly separate kids enforce wearing masks.

Hell, Corona, kids' latest vaccination records submitted school let attend. diseases fractions percent less likely spread hurt kill others. Oh, Tdap one month past due? Oh no, kids can't come school.

Now pandemic, care. go school virus vaccination (yet), little way treatments, highly contagious. Little government funds time make proper changes schools make properly safe. send kids school. virus kills 5 times flu. 

12k people die annualy US flu 
More 200k died 9 month. enforced? Thanks, hate it. OH GOSH! Barbara Bollier's campaign PUSHING hard. get phones texts DAILY since mail-in ballots went out. Yeah, that's treat protesters! Surround ring steel! Definitely fascist's wet dream Yes. critical factor. (pun intended)

I reading numbers, staff additional, say, 10 ICU beds takes 2 MD, 6 ICU qualified nursing 8-10 support staff. (Recommended, average).  put finger it, bed/room/equipment shortage personnel. 

That also means, however, (putting cynical hat) hospital says dangerously close overwhelmed actually means ""this gonna cost us shit load overtime, hire expensive contract help, burn staff"".  much add beds. probably empty rooms one floor down. ever issue? seem warehouses full ventilators. right. end day, person education needs priority

I believe this. Safety getting important 1 year education that's affected.

Possible death 1 year education affected. Really think this. government need get students safely back classrooms properly learn. 

And problem. One side (republicans) pushing grossly inhuman way. NEEDS point go back in. right now, push ""just go back. Masks mandatory"". early going back. ""safely go back"" option wait true treatments (like one trump got) vaccines (even they're partially effective) out. start integrating. agree shutting everything down, time large groups pushing callous students struggling whatever way, especially low income students, year education means world affect many years come.

I agree. They'll affected. Everyone, them, affected. something huge impactful. solution leave people unscathed. Right now, advocating pretty much go learn expense 10% teachers dying (lets honest, lot teachers older best shape), children, ton adults get virus children going school. SEE argument valid point can't compare year 4 months affected school work education growth DEATH. Avoiding death priority everything, needs doesn’t necessarily regard them. 

Well, affects me. late february, early march (before trump shut France shut down), one first lysol, spraying doorknobs, spraying desk. tell you, even though education good was, want risk health life go back. Heck, school recently proposed going back teach online classroom (no kids, set lot projectors, 65 inch tv's cameras follow around, good quality mics supposedly, etc) even want means going place others (cleaning staff, maintenance staff, teachers) maybe spread virus. top that, I'll meeting fellow teachers friends put position it'll awkward isolate them. So, even without students want go back. faster internet home. faster computer home. better audio home. need go risk it. Yes, education year people. health, health students, health children's family, health community important getting 70-80% class instead 80-100% class.

EDIT:

Speaking social aspect, that's another hard one. like label extroverted introvert. like alone time. times go out, like enjoy friends acquaintances. Many can't believe I'm introvert go them, I'm top 3 figure group outings. pandemic, I've gone twice someone. I've risked date/outing, I've asked myself, ""was really worth risk health, parents' health since live building""? Going back work (again, even without students), I'd feel social aspect wanting socialize. really important possibly getting sick dying infecting loved one family member?

I keep going back no, isn't. Yes, definitely does. believe installation current administration's latest puppet (aka Amy Covid Barrett) kickoff similar madness OP mentioned. rising wave.

No don’t. mean fine like Alan Colmes. Please God, let come here. believe will, also see strain healthcare system. see field hospitals near future. God anti lottery. one wants winner.

Holy shit, wishing POland luck handling this. hopeless Can't second wave never finish first ;) Chicago set overflow McCormick place. shut lights locked doors. 

Better safe sorry. Peru’s Ecuador’s excess death tolls downright horrifying. 0.23% 0.2% entire populations, respectively. Goddamn. That’s like NYC-level death tolls, scale whole country.  everyone would stay home 4 weeks wear masks, wash hands physical distance, could go back pretty normal life. think might beyond ""may"" here.

And failing whole life.  This...the result individualism propaganda entitled little assholes.. 
I'm almost ashamed sometimes trying harder enlighten people. sad can't better go get car drive CVS second say get it, would wake like 2 go get shot meant could actually go college. “I tired healthy alive! Let ignore everything going on!” - subreddit [Look compares France's America's cumulative deaths. obvious France entering second wave 5 months deaths America steady increase since beginning. wave never flattened US way France. working plans already, citizens lack follow them. Like Animal Channel shoot lions stuff puts asleep.  established many vaccines need given order things ""return normal""? , also Reference 4. April March studies westerners continue use words ""camp"", ""weld"" ""Draconian"" describe China's epidemic prevention measures, never able control virus. ideological view scientific epidemic prevention, spread virus completely scientific. longer summer, far stressful. Yes, always care. care much. Yet, apparently stuck home w/o way help. try advocate raise awareness. people believe reality. want believe want hear.

I insulted heavily people saying Thanksgiving we'll back normal worries said Thanksgiving 2021 we're lucky. movies everyone gulps elixir everyone back normal fully cured rejuvenated day. nature works. Masks widespread adoption Government ""investing"" money things instead testing🙄... Geez...  don’t think lower death rate last. Deaths still lagging hospitalizations. 

You’re right though. learned much virus stages illness treatment much better. Maybe I’m pessimistic.

Still way many people dying. problem was, least Michigan (US), stores sold nothing batteries hair supplies flowers candy started freaking last March shut yet big superstores like Meijer &amp; Walmart continued sell batteries, hair supplies, flowers, &amp; candy.

So state made rulings certain product types across board, regardless selling it.

RIP herd immunity strategy. Holy shit. statement fact-based. CDC found little evidence measures even advised recently 2019.  *deliberately* Fox thing. Correct - great Donald Trump says ""Our cases high test, test would cases"" /s

You visit interested data. Victoria tests yesterday completed million tests far. state population close 6.5 million. evangelical cult unfortunately like good quarter third population. anti-intellectuals devastating country. fully support Fauci pro mask come. really matter ""wave"" point? exactly ""2nd wave"" then? even learned that! economy! doctor fauci? ""fulltext"" link work me, even fixed.

The abstract, reference 4, see... point? supposed taking this? take opioids, risk coronavirus death always gonna higher opioids. So... UK isn’t part EU anymore. Borders closed everyone except new Zealand shocked face... Makes sense, masks wont end virus, vaccines will. healthcare worker getting tested. China literally welded people apartments Wuhan. People said dystopian worked. 

No one talking Vietnam though. Vietnam gone MONTHS without community spread. They’ve gotten lockdown without dicking entire economy. I’m happy seeing issues addressed. someone fairly cautious Covid (isolating), order delivery food. 

I wipe packaging wash hands, eat food it’s transferred clean plate. used heat everything microwave first, ordering numerous salads foods can’t heated, gave up. I’m guessing food preparer coughed Covid food, got delivered me, ate within, say hour, would exposed fairly large load virus.

I’ve read statements saliva kills virus, stomach acid whatever, seems unlikely me. good solid facts risk eating delivered fast food, ways mitigate risk, long overdue. Ah fair enough, didn’t realize New Zealander! get every drug lay hands see today huge milestone I’m glad guys made sacrifice. benefits whole Australia. question anyone understands typical process vaccines.. time actually test vaccines host host actually real virus? 

Last thing need something wild like major complication virus somehow overtakes vaccinated host, crazy talk? Umm, outside time. look cumulative number deaths entire country, pretty clear America still first wave. [This shows comparison France US. France first wave starting second wave. America whole never truly flattened curve, France stayed relatively flat 5 months first wave. got hit house. Fingers crossed escape mild asymptotic cases. talking people 60. agree it’s ridiculous think people protected. It’s like 90 year olds. That's good. Keep going nice steady. Focused protection doesn’t you...don’t bother it. follows familiar pattern. Cases generally rise first among highly social young people, including recently returning college students. Then, slowly bubble among older demographics, part multigenerational housing interactions. analysis published CDC’s Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report last month found increasing infections among younger adults generally followed upticks 60-plus demographic area four 15 days later.

No one surprised this. AZ trials paused US long? affect us getting access vaccine? US trials? student one top colleges country, mess. teachers don’t know teach Zoom. It’s hard grasp certain concepts without person aspect extra help. lack relationships made depressing overwhelming. agree distance learning replacement we’re moment, definitely isn’t good chaotic. coming someone who’s always 4.0 student. nursing major, concepts I’m learning need taught person taught online feasible whatsoever. two elementary aged siblings one bawling eyes struggling online learning (has also always straight student) hates seeing friends. therapist depression. sibling isn’t much better.

Let’s even get attributes like students don’t get eat day school food meals. Students abusive households don’t school escape anymore. Special educated students falling even behind they’re thoroughly understanding online education. There’s many pieces puzzle.

At end day, person education needs priority. States government need get students safely back classrooms properly learn. you, may big deal millions students missing “a year so” quality education. students struggling whatever way, especially low income students, year education means world affect many years come.

Edit: part, agree said. needs bigger priority get students back person that’s all. think lot people sub don’t care subject doesn’t necessarily regard them. time school. don’t children. They’re grown adults. think people dying virus directly negative current situation. overall don’t care children neglected future. experiencing pandemic disrupted whole education social growth, makes hard relate. fall greater** 65, compared younger age groups, **in without symptoms compared full-blown Covid-19.**  number healthcare workers antibodies remained relatively high**, researchers suggest may due regular exposure virus.

So mild exposure enough. Thank you, that’s kind info looking for! , also read study's reference 4.

edited link: reddit like /fulltext links somehow. weird ...it's another subtopic major discussion. bad discuss something? We're monkeys. developed ability discuss multiple topics analyze nuances. 

Maybe care, people do. promise make forget pandemic going on.

Damn. Imagine even able add small detail topic without people getting annoyed mentioned one semantic detail side-note. 

And science, semantics important. Insulin, example, *just insulin*. faster peak times, slower. acting waves matter they're administered. 
Sometimes details something good look at, promise derail major topic. different. widespread community transmission thats control, therefore borders closed solve problem. repeatedly pointed country example one border controls work cases ""widespread community transmission"", suppression measures implemented.

No country example good lockdown measures stop spread within. never able control domestic spread border closures. That's problem solves. Border controls nothing community transmission community transmission happens within fucking border. 

There two separate issues. Foreign spread domestic spread. 52k new cases, less 1% coming abroad. Therefore main concern stopping community spread. people coming abroad drops fucking ocean. Closing borders solve issue face, bringing red herring. many times said border controls along suppression measures within country necessary?

And many times fucking tell countries worried foreign travel right also fucking borders closed already. Closing borders solution state countries right now. absolutely nothing help state right now. 

This entire conversation irrelevant multiple reasons. main one countries fact borders closed. second issues face presently solved stricter border controls. cannot fathom countries dealing domestic spread right now, border closures nothing prevent domestic spread, beyond useless conversation. 

And talk poor reading comprehension even competent enough understand border controls effective fighting. Right France needs significant lockdown measures. Border closures wont help slightest since cases coming abroad. make border closures useless, makes irrelevant conversation. 

The fact mind numbingly incompetent unable see point making truly sight behold. mean we're practically agreeing seem think borders like 50% solution. measures like mask wearing, social distancing, closure non essential business, *vast* majority fight covid. Closing boders would tiny fucking effect countries even worth bringing up. zero overall effect, useless countries right now. 

When talk border closures miraculously effective add measures actually legwork fucking afterthought empowering dumbasses think closing border need do. That's entire conversation started. Somebody suggesting borders closed, thread France 52k *domestic* cases. pointless conversation curb spread countries. Yes course merit, merit magically make even remotely relevant measures exponentially important talked instead. That's interest rate. Look price bonds market. TLT good starting point. introvert social anxiety though, gunna lie, really better without go public crowded places, even I, hermit, reached point cabin fever. really upsetting though extremely cautious everything part since March.. 8 months many people adamantly refused even attempt give shit, feels like isolation seriously never going end evidence (yet) people losing antibodies virus. commercial test comes negative, issue test 'sensitive' enough detect them.

What might interest cell tests. expensive, enlightening. cells respond coronaviruses (via antibodies), immunue. You’re true legends, without guys paving way proving what’s possible doubt Victoria’s response could’ve happened way did. superpower basically California + New York :/ watch everyone gets excited. Christmas miracle means. There's lot involved distribution storage vaccine Yes short term pain long term gain! mean like white people get shot black people police

This false. 

Comparing many often white people killed police many often black people killed police statistically dubious unless first adjust population. 

According recent census data, nearly 160 million white people America black people. White people make roughly 62% U.S. population 49% killed police officers. Black Americans, however, account 24% fatally shot killed police despite 13% U.S. population.

That means Black Americans 2.5 times likely White Americans killed police. go ahead stop talking you’re going say stupid things. oxford one states? ah bad, default seems pessimistic figured implying! hope too, pretty rough lockdown i'm grateful it. Alaska mandated managed quarantine 14 days like NZ people coming country could've kept numbers down. 

With low numbers, aggressive testing, contact tracing, supported isolation cases/contacts keep relatively contained. plenty time prepare no, ""we choice"". know specific topic, Trump's closing argument constantly tweeting ""COVID COVID COVID,"" referencing Brady Bunch. Somehow, driven distress. sick fucking animal making pop culture jokes we're facing mass graves. can't wait public without assess risk. around others without care world want. Narcissism/ Selfishness. swab often fail pick virus material infected person, called false negative. Immediately infection, virus time replicate airway, swab absolutely fail find it, means false negative rate 100%. test gradually become reliable time, even best times, fail pick infection 20% time. Therefore, swabs tell infected, never tell Cant get second wave, keep riding first! Sugar addictive. People really suffer unless get hit. Great, send Dr. Fauci Europe, knowledge would appreciated :p

Just kidding, truly hope wont fired. correct. article misinformation headline fear clickbait probably slap free awards first thing see like many others It’s okay, many candidates phase 3.

I don’t think sacrifices made slow virus nothing. problem demonstrating success venture prevents something happening opponents venture deny anything prevalence meant stopped. 

If US hadn’t taken inadequately rigorous short ‘quasi-shutdown’, current escalation cases would started higher number infections, would likely mean would current miserable position sooner would bigger mess.

The way US states approached so-called ‘lock downs’ underdelivered slowing spread virus. gives politicians cover reject second, proper lockdown (fewer people allowed leave home near home hour two, comprehensive testing rapid results, prompt contact tracing enforced quarantine) saying undeniably high economic cost earlier ‘lockdown’ justified. 

The result half million dead February, many, many sickened. long lasting (possibly permanent impairments). higher number cases worsen hammering economy taking - especially news images emerge overwhelmed hospitals, people triaged left die, refrigerated trucks storing bodies mass graves. got glimpse New York, resources beat back infection. majority states cusp situation. Many lack resources,
will know-how mitigate situation materially. 

To scrape April, New York relied huge number traveling doctors, nurses techs. resources wanted states. hospitals Texas currently bidding $4,500 per week plus accommodation nurses. time, hospital personnel falling victim infection others becoming burned work.

The next six nine months going harrowing - assuming least couple vaccines demonstrated safe effective end year, manufacturing, shipping storage get worked out, people trust enough ensure adequate numbers vaccinated serious side effects don’t arise months vaccination immunity lasts least months. stars align may sufficient population immunity resume something like normal life. also presupposes figure way pay people thrown work enough avoid destitution companies employed go under. Yes... also public health laws punish people negligently put people's lives risk.

Why think countries like South Korea dealt outbreaks quickly. Government control dog-whistle 'socialism', ya know. Wasn’t Canada really well long ago? Maybe confused, sorry hear predicament, Aussie here. lucky small town Australia. Thats true infected well though. can't compere verified infected vs believed reinfections. Even _scary_ extremely subjective. anyone know survival percentage covid? looked said 2% people died. true? We’re last, means we’re first! live Georgia dropped wallet outside froyo place someone mailed back everything still inside. never ever since already control like 3 months lockdown. endemic fight started creates impression 59 infected plane. 13 cases plane

Also, va care, particularly inpatient care, probably better private care(though that's probably indictment private care vindication va care) new copy pasta sure. sure matters wave. think cares many times gets ride. good call, especialy street usually full people night since pubs closed. Good call indeed. don’t catch virus (cold/sniffles) cold weather. That’s old wives’ tale, lol. Yeah pandemic fatigue Im getting sick tired one part wearing damn mask. Im fatigued worry families health control put others protect us.

Your health dependent health, health dependent health. least Europe true),

People going bars restaurants keeping masks lol. always tho. We're aware would direct airflow face. HEPA filtered air would rather column air come push everything else way, making likely air breath filtered. might right, average american wants go hospital help they'd ask someone take ER Poles go SOR. hospital staff asks patients avoid SOR theyd probably mean ER usa. masks work nearly well want think. exposed , viral load would likely drastically lower

Thats go for. flown since march take NYC subway every day try sanitary possible worry I'm 100% secure. mask shower home sanitize phone alcohol wipes. one flight many? take months roll out? allow country manufacturer multiple factories?

No, isn't. know colds diseases usually transmit schools necessarily transfer, fact appear apply. Causal links like ""when schools opened, transmission increased"" also show much. Schools opening coincided lot things parents commuting on. 
As counterpoint: schools e.g. Helsinki (schools closing) Stockholm (schools closing) showed little difference spread. 
So no, know, what's ""common knowledge"" apply. soon winter hit regieme started show cracks. fall apart. 

Look Kelowna outbreak, contained 6 weeks without lockdown measures. trace isolate. 

But Edmonton outbreak contact tracers overworked finding people getting infected forced investigate 3/4 generations chain. 3x much work trace contacts 1 infected person. That's point. Edmonton resorting shutting things contain latest outbreak. 

In many ways Edmonton better prepared:

1. Manditory mask order Edmonton (BC time suggested);
2. Contact tracing app (BC waiting Federal one); and
3. Widespread symptomatic testing particularly high risk areas.

also need remember even kids showing direct symptoms covid creating effects last well after. Like said, enjoy staying living fear. That’s one else’s problem own. Hahahaha Quite westernized ""Indian"" dishes UK. believe it’s 65% protection wearer. insignificant. Good. Yeah, well, it’s kind like soft-voiced fireman house flames quiet voice urges people leave effing building!

Our country fire, people dying, futures destroyed, WELL BEYOND TIME USING INDOOR VOICES!!! Unless want tell countries like UAE Bahrain totally cool suggesting, testing Uyghurs?

Probably knows?

So know certain China running vaccine trials inside China? sad... topic question tho, appropriate response post like this? Upvote downvote? know? Cause depressing fuck really bad post either. True. notice ironic guys calling hostile unpleasant yet refusing engage I've said simply insulting me?

The point saying allowing manipulated propaganda like means simply 'Other' people feel free dismiss opinions without rational thought they're assholes go, divide-and-conquer everyone agree Nazi. Well done, carry on. true entire aircrafts air replaced matter minutes HEPA filtration cost additional deaths,

I'm guessing employed family employed elementary/primary school. Cause that's life considering expendable. Temperaturewise, India year round

Not quite. Delhi's maximum temperature goes beyond 45 degrees summer. Delhi dips 2-3 degrees winter. assume I'm ill informed you. Crazy smart, yea .. bias saying vaccine isn’t safe simply Trump says is. That’s whole thread. 

You can’t get Trump pushing unsafe vaccine without career scientists pushing unsafe vaccine. aware snowstorms caused people driving roads opening roads much cause snow return.

Closing streets time prevent people caught blizzard. close blizzard happening, send rescue workers endanger lives, too. difference is: could put sign saying ""Blizzard coming, still go, own"". Yeah. cops ignore since understand want bothered. USA, they'll kill you. 365 million people

They’re taught young age solely greater good, good bad ( look Japan’s work culture SK’s toxic corperation culture). want vaccine succeed! Ohhh, thought talking airlines’ air vents circulate air cabin. Lol really confused wanted reduced airflow.

Now understand talking respirator’s vent. southwest still blocking middle seats states like Kerala WB seeing second wave right now.  explains WI hard time getting people wear masks. WI rampant personality disorders swear God. Trust me, dumbasses refuse wear mask too.

Tbh, it’s bad luck. fucking expects fucking world wide pandemic?
Government good, lot support although I’ve lost $130k least little cash start small restaurant suburbs.
Murdoch media straight garbage, fucker needs suffocated Belgium far 330k confirmed cases, 14k cases per day, population 11.5M.

If assume herd immunity reached 8.6M cases, would need see 8.3M cases, nearly 600 days current rate.

We however seeing massive growth probably 60% per week, significant under-testing. therefore need either maintain growth rate, assume under-testing least 4:1 20% weekly growth rate, hit absurd numbers. rates: going bloodbath. Thank .I really appreciate . ❤️ They'll make something different, worry. He's human whole family threatened. course cares.

Nobody likes see family threatened, matter tough personally are. | world acting like everything fine dandy. going brutal wake call. 

Not generations caused though, they'll dead Note P100 filters rated worn full face mask (read 3M specs). half face mask rated P100, since half face mask quite bit leakage even properly fit. K, going test half? think thing could done better keep high schools maybe middle schools distance. see possible solution elementary kindergarten, possibility keeping closed arose parents started protesting (with reason imo).

Probably governments got data March/April young people harder infect (?) took decision, see reasons. approve already!! voted, halffff true.

Stupid people stupid leadership = now. (Ok arguing here, but.) 

I think scary real-world sign immunity doesnt last Belgium example one worst hit countries spring. cases though roof again.

Shouldnt immunity stop partially? maybe did, signs/studies that. Maybe areas/cities hit. Kudos Victoria keep good practices, maybe it'll rub countries, way go! everyone antimaskers sweden? swede figured it’s norms. dont think they’re anti it, comfortable barely one wears dont wear yourself. I’m sure would say remember said cautious masks make people touch face also fact make people go ”well wear mask everything fine” let guard regarding distancing ultimately focused encouraging people krep distance keep clean, course masks still good thing. yeah mean, live college city lot parties people sitting restaurants n stuff, don’t think young people think much unfortunately atleast terms city Yup. Really wish magic wand could wave see many people ACTUALLY point time. confusing overloaded terms weird idea mathematics apply different ways different fields.

I talking underlying mathematics ""different"", merely terminology different. geography though. US even managed fuck Hawaii, every geographic advantage, island warm climate. Attempting* indicators immunity? wear face masks. Honestly still discussion? Corona going away. Like viruses perish country locks wears masks etc ... Poland locked early hard. Closed borders early. second wave they've switched strategy much looser.

I buy travel patterns thing. huge numbers Poles across Europe travel back forth. reduced numbers came government action.

So change attitude gov? think election. locked hard win election. election done protecting business interests people. want tell u happen me, surreal want cry.

I got infected corona sometime last week, anyways got headache saturday lunch time, fever night, fever sunday, tested positive monday, today feeling fine woth symptoms all


The problem last week brought identical cool masks gave one mum happy wear them.

On friday, took car, (she ususally never that) left mask there. wearing mask day (thursday) kniw series bad luck played, mistook mask hers, wore it! good hour think. realized mistake eventually saw mask bag.

My mum auto immune disease take lowering immunity drug. feel angry sad guilty

As summary.

I wearing mask thursday.

My mum wore mask friday.

I got first symptoms satruday night.

As today, still fine. got exposed friday morning, exactly 94 hours (it's tuesday morning now). 4 days ago. Time change French Fries back ""Freedom Fries!""  trump doesn’t give shit. live country born in. pretty much isolated since March mental health suffering. I'm obeying restrictions come telling I'm asshole pandemic fatigue feel like cannot much longer. Mine virtual well taking risk. wear masks out, online ordering groceries. Crazy ppl care. KNEW IT! crap analogy. Stay safe educate him! Can’t second wave never left first Blue shirt guy, go live another planet? build rocket get with.

In honesty, get it. I'm terrified psychological toll take children. No. conspiracy theorists either knowledgeable enough know difference knowledgeable enough able twist pseudo-scientific facts enough make still sound like evil mastermind. take fauci. know means either. sumbass parents probably let kids go trick treating Halloween wish people would stop making excuses jackasses.  say **none covid vaccines works meant prevent infection** \- help fight virus Forbes: infection *not* criterion success vaccines. fact, endpoints require confirmed infections include analysis success,  difference severity symptoms vaccinated unvaccinated. Measuring differences amongst infected SARS-CoV-2 underscores implicit conclusion vaccines expected prevent infection, modify symptoms infected.

That's immunity vaccination works. build forcefield around body keeping pathogen out, lets body clear quickly gets in. won't, dunno bring up! personally happy coexist bipedal gas bags get confirmation elderly vulnerable longer considered risk.*

That's actually wrote.

*"" said I'll wait vulnerable get medical protection contributing risk.* 

That's later claimed wrote. 

Slightly different. No! oddly links promoted Chinese Communist Party. link mentions looking China CCP allow investigation  P100 N95/FFP3 equivalents, better. 3M recommendations use Covid settings website. recently got Drager X-Plore 3500 P3 (EU P100 filters) say fit comfort leagues beyond anything I’ve worn past months. 3M halfmasks anything like that, get eye protection you’re set. 

N95/FFP2s still convenient flying case identify passport controls. Airnium, don’t know anything them. Haven’t seen used healthcare can’t vouch it. people want over, safely otherwise.

Whether agree not, governments develop policies acknowledge exist compliance becoming difficult secure. 

If means enforcement, deliberate slack system people take view may well hanged sheep lamb, probably combination, it. mean 2/3 excess deaths tested covid. likely roughly caused COVID infections. instance single largest number 10,000 non-covid- tested excess deaths Florida, many caused pneumonia. 

There certainly positive collateral deaths, although I've yet see single provable example. also negative collateral deaths (reduced numbers accidental deaths).

It's really worth arguing good science this. country appear interested find killed 100,000 people stopping it. Frankly take evidence they're probably caused infection, could argue way too. grow ohio know it’s tourist destination? sandusky less hour grew home one famous amusement parks world, Cedar Point. thousands people come work every summer, including many international workers; enough transient employees dorm housing them. people come world park. addition that, coast lake erie incredibly popular domestic tourism. sandy beaches, water sports (parasailing, jet skiing, etc), ferries lake erie islands, kalahari (the largest indoor water park country)... one small city. ohio major tourist destination sure.

On hand, experience bad food. words speak pollicization Coronavirus pandemic. 

And Coronavirus sub. true. lot time attacking heart makes lung function diminish. Also cytokine storms.

The scarring heart causes heart failure, cause lung function diminish. everything function diminished.

Although right people even mild symptoms dying heart failure, people dying cant breathe infections ventilator long. found Google AMP links comment. normal links:

It case getting point young person case get point young person spreading old person lead fraction deaths reported today. explicitly said trump making vaccine.

Kinda hard antivaxxer every shot got flu shot days ago. 

[My fears arent Trump already caught trying fuck stuff. sure, fda needs clear it, picks head fda. Oh yea, trump. could put lame duck wants make captain orange happy. may anti-vaxxers, suspect lot vaccine-cautious people wait year two data processed. wont first line vaccine, may get one eventually. patient promoting it, people opt transfer. voluntary. similarly surprised Uppsalas numbers yesterday: 142 192 last Monday, cannot effect local recommendations yet. Meanwhile Kronoberg, Skåne Örebro delivering quickly new cases even Stockholm catching up. Skånes numbers look almost like parts Central Europe. rising hospitalization deaths older people

 article makes claims, graph. statement appears drawing conclusion simply there.

 fact, I've seen articles say opposite. Even average age hospitalizations going down. mean example works certain people. someone 65+, thought ventilator ICU real odds someone 35 gets one nearly non existent. Let’s real- isn’t exactly America needs. F LA Yeah! many states mask mandates many actually enforced? Rust belt swing states looking good. Stockholm syndrome tells us they’ll still vote hand continues beat them. Agree. expect briefings provide numbers often Exactly 0% people taken vaccine trials ended ventilator. Senate adjourned 11/9 Survival fittest. Totally naive question, care people take vaccine? mean, besides people can't take vaccine inmune disorder, take mine keep life clue talking lol it’s mask. It’s common decency severely lacking. Hence anti maskers assholes. dont think going quite world ending situation forecasting become truly difficult winter opinion going flip flop. 330 million people still many dont know anyone whos covid know mid 20 something sniffles loss taste days dont think serious.  Also they're islands. people America-centric view either believe USA best everything, worst. Oh wow, brave. Glad stood up. Bet everyone street thinks hero. course questions alone can’t diagnose disorder without examined psychiatrist, study claim association compliance diagnosed antisocial disorders antisocial traits.

My problem mostly due article written. implies diagnosed disorder without formal diagnosis. 

A study associating anti-social ""traits"" without proper diagnosis best meaningless. many Sweden infected. 

Deaths much Europe tracked precisely. Euromomo numbers many countries. think independent group validates internal analysis, may wrong. Protocol changed much entirely sure correct though. 7 days Rhine bust! think non-hardcore vaccination opponents persuaded quite easily. people kiss opinions principles goodbye moment become inconvenient. instance major countries airlines require proof vaccination enter, bet lot folks take it. I'll discussion anytime horrible atrocities Biden committed. son robbing world whole family. Joe cheating countries money lying world it. emails, proof. 

But every conversation turns ""what Trump"" ""Trump lies"" doesn't. media messed head. 

I emails. proof. Joe Biden lying world stealing money. though? undervaluing mental health. good nobody expert Y'all island. Europe bunch countries sharing borders. really comparable. monitor borders. Yup, that's me. Old lady says weird shit. Nobody listens. really news. obesity rate days says no, can't. I've learned anything weight loss efforts, average American thinks going 2 hours without shoving much shit gullet possible akin literally starving death. 300 people limit folks seated least 1 next person (if remember correctly). fact spectrum comes things though. There's huge financial political incentive first market matter what, can't say many governments managed boost credibility crisis. things worry people, like completely unjustified either.  

My immediate family opposite anti-vaxx (flu shot every year etc.) even worries completely new vaccine 'rushed' based new technology. clear, they'd rather self-isolate months make sure. they're much less worried Oxford vaccine since explained based existing vaccine working previously. Yes makes sense! Thank sounds obvious said fell bit daft asking now... opinion worthy known relevant spread pandemic? think that's suggest low dose
 87 mg vs 365 maximum strength.

I'm positive prevents damage also take milk thistle supposed promote healthy liver long traditionally taken. Obviously try speed up, pressed time all, getting data (it gotten vs hasn't, blood sample reading etc must included) writing thing takes time.

I think took one month phase II submit findings, sure mixing Moderna Pfizer not. ""british"" savory dishes ever heard imported.

You guys make killer sweets though. mean education Germany high value schools/kindergarten last thing close one last. . 
And school running normal , lot hygiene concepts minize risk getting big clusters. 
If infections numbers rising measures get strictly expanded eventually schools get closed completely (on local level) numbers get high. Zombie apocalypse starting? It’s bit tense wait four days update see explosive development large parts Europe. 

That said, 5191 cases lower end expectations. It’s average ~1300 cases per day matches 7-day average peak worldometers might indicate beginning Tegnell

Not Tegnell. people always act like done one person?

Anyway, 300 person crowd limit big spaces, sufficient social distancing practiced easily anyway? must force-fed led paint child, nothing else explain amount stupidity come post post. fail comprehend completely obvious basic concepts choose repeatedly ignore points make, I'm done conversation. Ouch... 2020. disease turns redcap. Thank Donald, cool! rich ones promoting unsafe behaviour brings countries critical situations maintain profits? seems played delusion freedom sounds like simple egoism. freedom people following guidelimes pay price irresponsibles generated critical situation? freedom fall ill people care? invoke right freedom costs allowed shoot spot endanger them? vote yes. That’s bullshit told protests cause covid fact tons articles June mass protests fact lower covid cases area. Can’t ways Poland You’re friend brought masks hospital critically short every hospital country??
That’s guarantee get fired work It’s one big wave huge flare ups within it, makes sense assuming unblinding data takes two weeks? analysis needs done Pfizer point. entire point blinded trials independent board analysis; Pfizer. doubt rare re-infected, like every virus. think developing severe symptoms second time, rare. maybe would bestg &amp; family eating rich seem resigned enslavement definition antivaxxer. think Trump lab making vaccine says good go? course not. Third-party scientists making vaccine go rigorous testing approval process. trust process, antivaxxer. won’t surprised many countries outright ban American tourist considerable period time. study making [fundamental attribution hate someone cuts highway, speeding around you? might say ""slow asshole!"" using behavior make judgement character. However, late child's play speed highway, might cut people saying ""sorry, gotta go!"" using situation explain character.

This precisely feel like good-hearted, well-intentioned samaritan wearing mask, call everyone callous, hostile, deceitful asshole. There's obvious explanation, right?

In reality, what's likely happening many people choose wear mask [psychological getting home school, planning homework little snack, parent told get started homework? piss off? *hate* told do, especially already going it. probably felt callous hostile, probably wanted deceitful spite them.

I know get everyone wear mask. However, shouting people wear one making sorts character judgements absolutely work.

Please kill ""holier thou"" mindsets. They're part problem. I'm South Dakota, like 80% literally can't bothered care here. wife trans thrilled shave face dilligently. Anyone else driving expired license plate? refuse go DMV lol Tegnell still thinks good idea raise crowd limit 50 300 persons.

Region Skane however impose local restrictions keeps crowd size limit 50 persons. Yeah it’s weird, it’s people want things worse actually are. seems likely immunity, cases, lasts months. didn’t we’d hearing thousands cases re-infections, outliers. That's coming dude publicly claimed nothing afraid anymore back summer, encouraging elderly go vote en masse (because mostly vote party) allowing things like 300-guest wedding parties MMA fights hundreds spectators happen.

Also, risk maybe, maybe, good idea tell puppet constitutional court rule case time? take genius figure banning abortion spark massive protests. remember article suggesting BLM protests actually reduced Covid-19 rates. differ? data monitoring board get data right away (I almost sure charge analysis, rather charge validating analysis), Pfizer/BionTech still un-blinding make required analysis hand them. data, theory able see analysis matches raw data take short time. time needed FDA required analysis un-blinding still there. can't even start un-blind hit 32. easier talk shit people breath since can't see mouth moving. Random benefit. costs COVID-19 hammering budgets spot-check four east-metro school districts shows spend least $23 million COVID-related costs end year. Officials alarmed expenses involved distance learning, sanitizing, masks plastic could easily double amount. Yikes... nope, exactly except modern Americans seem challenge Jane Fonda fucking lunatic. time protest houses, fuck looking riots businesses. Find assholes live lets surround houses. Rookie numbers Honesty care her.
But message worthy known.
And yes, word ""tried"". I've trying.
And mostly succeeding.

Mods seem obsessed letting message out.
Not sure why, fact checked. say it.
And topic. Agreed work then? post \*

I thought one said deleting case, feed show deleted post. I'm guessing type person propaganda quite effective on.  lot stuff needs done early many Western countries twiddled thumbs instead getting ahead virus. Certain things worked well places like Taiwan simply feasible point parts world virus surging. way, bad people making be

It is, isn't.

Would immediately shit bed fear tested positive? (No, kept hospital overnight early stages thought did... doctor told prepare positive result, negative).

That said, 8,000 people die US day. large proportion need much care (they sudden heart attack, die sleep, etc.). linger days months. add thousand two respiratory deaths mix, well serious cases become fatal, requires resources basically exist.

With mind, could easily end couple million deaths. Sure, might look like one person airliner full people, that's still tens millions grieving lost loved ones twice many Americans died WW2. always thought ""Randy."" remember C++ teacher saying, ""Ever notice Randys assholes?"" Records records fucking lock downs about? hardly shit lockdowns except maybe ""go drive curbside pickup"" ... economy suffering people losing jobs due lack spending consumer confidence toilet one wants dine high viral loads environment.  


Personally, going restaurants amount anti-maskers area high cook home now. That's them, going take care myself. wanted money economy could decent human beings.  


Businesses charities, staff making sales go under. homicide city day fairly affluent neighborhood, news crew waited 2 hours someone go restaurant across street get feedback made feel, one even tried go open restaurant 2 hours. place packed time virus started spread. That's government, that's people caused that. would reasonable followed public health advisor's suggestions gotten cases people nervous picking gallon milk. That's simply true. Maybe national level something like 80% country locked various forms better part April May. also shut foreign travel anyone else widely mocked EU even though quickly followed suite. Yes lock downs mask mandates handled state level US operates. states greater say countries. Im sick seeing ""antibodies go away months AAAAHHHH"" articles. known months yet scaremongering non scientists continues. That’s good thing. don’t want one article says one thing, want multiple talking points sources. 

Not many countries available really one prominent news source. point even odds finding covid patient January good question - check many IU multivit. usually enough (usually like 400-800 IU). 

If there's small amount, there's nothing wrong taking extra 3000iu, buy vitamin 1000iu capsules, take supplemental Mg based much multivitamin. 

The thing consider form vitamins multivit are. oxides chelates bioavailable things like picolinate citrates. something consider.

The reason use not-as-bioavailable forms bc sadly cheaper make multivit forms better ones body easier time handling. assume limited testing site video says plan require passenger tested within 72 hours boarding? ^^Unless ^^you ^^didn't ^^watch ^^the ^^video ^^shockedpikachu.jpg love sub stops mentioning places like Florida longer fits narrative. Despite removing restrictions, Florida fine right now. almost everywhere get hit same, regardless measures taken. naturally occurring virus run course like every virus history world - wearing piece cloth mouth going stop it. November 30th :( was, Europe, look now. Widespread protests Italy, Spain, Germany, true nationwide lockdown like before, curfews night venues closed. 

More confirmation Swedish model right. It’s first wave still going physically prevent people accessing elevator?

What bully. especially someone going covid unit hospital

Given level community transmission, would wise consider local grocery store COVID19 Maybe Ebola call standard!

Negative. Ebola respiratory virus. Ebola actually difficult transmit requires contact bodily go step , probably around 30% mankind people.

Based what? Don’t know overdose anything! Yeah point ins attributing deadliness virus might accurate better pocture data Assholes tend think world cares opinion.

...wait minute... following logic there. know ratios percentages right? you’re going cite IFR percentage, use source presents format:

[IFR couple orders magnitude off. split Roman empire power west thousand six hundred years going back east. Definitely see one coming. Huh, knew? we. numbers users going Optimistic WA state currently investigating 100+ cases possible reinfection.

Now vaccines carefully made try induce robust response possible, consistent manner natural infection. hope there. know get third stage vaccine reviews.  course. general that's counteracted FAR less people public.

Again, general opinion people whole, form rule. could 92/8 86/14 given sample, whole still believe 90/10 generally true. People probably downvoting understand difference probability percentage. Look logarithmic plot, graph linear there, it’s exponential growth. home-made one spray Lysol uses, wash soap every week. foolish expect similar results despite obviously different situations. think China fair comparison US similar think would fair compare France Spain Germany. literally insane. There's way even feasible. 900k-1 million people flying every day right now. tested negative 4 days flying, cares. easily could caught 4 days. flying back somewhere? stop day get get swapped hope results come back flight home? weekend business trip fly 48 hours later? 24? logistically feasible benefit comes nowhere close outweighing cost. better fever checks. now.  Well, depends.

If take ""dry"" vitamin (as tablets) eat food well vitamin solve fat food.

However, take vitamin oil pearls, think take without food want to. Murdering sanctioning brown people Middle East example ""valuing human rights highly""?

Take note uses qualifier expressing opinion rather making statement fact.  Awesome good you. wearing masks NYC March afraid people freaking it. Several people got angry yelled ran away shouting diseased.

Dude, safer around n95 unmasked people ran trying get away me.

Masks made people irrationally angry early days. somehow made feel severe cognitive dissonance lashed mask wearers it. 

I think wanted stay denial coronavirus mask contradicted that. mask scared wearing one thus unprotected thus lashing unpleasant realization... 

I mean...the mind boggles.

I'm afraid ever leaving NYC many people still wear masks wearing one may put danger meet wrong Neanderthal. tried zoom hangouts friends? good still get social interactions Haha sorry misunderstanding actually agree, feeling they’ll lie. I’m including people personally know, mostly good people, look lie “necessity “. Actually US number 3 per capita cases, Israel number 1, Belgium number 2 fuck load better almost everywhere else. know that's lockdown I've read that's case, kind lockdown, one people go to... Wait it, go work go school. want source I'll look Thanks, acknowledged different comment. 
 
Still, stop maybes. Assert it. That's I'd do. guys, put sun screen summer, give WORSE sunburn! oily, oil gets hot cooks stuff! Checkmate, atheists. safe consume, *over* consume. 

D fat-soluble meaning overdose make sick. hope right. Bavarian hope Soeder prepared go forward alone need be!

Bring on! One Mississippi death, two Mississippi deaths... Keeping away people works best. cant masks help. Vitamin seems work rather well get sick, isnt getting enough  Stephen Amell Huh yeah ok concerning. coronavirus evolved bats rely antibodies cell response fighting viral infections. stands assume coronavirus tricks sleeves.

Those get sickest fail mount proper cell response. robust cell response good outcomes. people genetic abnormalities prevent mounting strong antiviral cell response.

This weird virus vaccines target inducing strong b cell/antibody response. course tailored historically we've worked vaccines inducing antibodies we've focused response opposed cell.

It's likely vaccines work well people might able mount protective response based vaccine.

I cautiously optimistic. Pooooo tin  [Big Pharma right Florida drop 9th place soon Wisconsin reported higher number cases Florida one fourth population meet earlier private gatherings sleep host's place. Prob saying might died covid, could due another cause. maybe official cause death yet TBD there's way contain seasonal flu. endemic. COVID yet. think something like wearing mask flu season common like Japan, there's way truly stop flu point. still saddens me. part getting flu shot staying home I'm sick I'll probably wear mask crowded spaces on. sound right, seems Canada painted role model US countries. true. People empathy evil. makes even dangerous. think losing approach saying OK 100,000 people die preventable disease long wear mask, really, really easy. lol includes lot Democrat protesters soon US heard COVID, worked asses get testing available people immediately instead discouraging testing (thanks Trump). COVID related healthcare costs made free uninsured worry paying $100 fucking test able afford hospital bills. money thrown hospitals, hospital workers, hospital equipment. reason people dying there's enough ventilators going around. 

There strict lockdown policy country/state borders closed. Access could've allowed case case basis mandatory testing enforced solo quarantining person waits test results. stayed place infection rates max 10/day urban environment. Banning travel great, China, anywhere else big COVID issue. know big bedbug problem, would want sit couch? Absofuckinglutely right? analogy good enough reason anyone understand banning travel period would've perfect. need place stay, government could've paid quarantining hotel/testing cleared leave plane people also cleared leave.

The Trump administration handling COVID basically neglecting shit hit fan. preventive costs would've way cheaper dealing aftermath (e.g. business bailouts shutdowns, ridiculously high unemployment rates, PUA). take look Vietnam see good policy was. Granted, size difference immense, planning there.

What do? Hold anti-masks rallies make COVID bipartisan issue, withhold COVID related unemployment aid election results political BS, charge people ass COVID healthcare, etc. list stupid shit list important things long name.

Surely, understand gist right? think could've made point clearer without wanting smash phone wall lol. lol would rather say good two weeks behind neighbors. completely irritating we'll running seeing eye harder measures two weeks,when could act lighter measures.  Australia NZ achieved success level social cohesion government competence also implausible US.

The seeds what's occurring US planted decades ago. makes sense me. can’t please people time. Eventually, learn deflect mute never ending criticism receive whatever base pleasing. eventually lead less empathy mechanism dealing constant criticism. That’s politics. well please everyone still appearing good leader process. That’s current POTUS failure. thing brags (not politician) one main reasons unfit job, IMO. POTUS actually needs politician diplomat order serve diverse nation good representative foreign affairs. believe checks neither boxes. Unfortunately, live consumer-based country without ample money, life hard. Many people vote solely based fact belief power, net income higher someone else power. Can’t really blame someone already struggling month month take approach. It’s job opponent convince people otherwise. state wants state can. know people got 250,- fine spring coming wrong house entrance. Hey Donald, seeing ... Putin mandating, time get board well. Let's get program comrad.  take account american demographic take time think obesity levels, even adults aged 25-44. combine obesity, many cases cause lot heart problems, covid. Stunning aint it? tou bombard downvotes, say covid kill healthy adults train, eat well etc. justs kills muuuuuuch smaller percentage compared unhelthy ones. may spread faster care homes get affected. saw chart region numbers biggest clusters are, guess what, 26% schools universities 17% workplaces.

So think, least us, kind problem. hope Publix gives $10 GCs w/ covid vaccine like flu vaccine. *""Doesn't count, trust sources, questions asked loaded, ask enough people, asked many people x-demographic, study flawed, misinterpreted data sell masks, people tests trusted""*

etc etc etc. Usual bullshit pops whenever they're proven wrong. Putin needs understand Donald change course, world economy going recover US cases alone infiltrate every country aboard via rich people dual citizenships. 

So need contain within country every country. Or, maybe, I'm spit balling here... SOMEONE (a candidate) made vaccine, rest America (who zero impact release information) waiting. generalization America whole misdirected exactly causing type situation: longer allowed defined anything else leaders political party affiliation, despite fact political affiliation comes essentially agreeing 51% policies one party 49% leaders singular entity representation entire country. 

No wonder NRW worst Laender country ... They're still going allow dozens restaurants even bars without masks? Unless they're outdoors improved filtration systems, actually help? 2 ""friends"" anti-maskers share one thing common, think they're smarter everybody else, spite fact even graduate high school.  Callous, hostile, deceitful ... yep, sounds like evangelicals know. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* large indeed, updated number good question, recall number Xinjiang appeared first wave, bbc' article Chinese authorities strategy mass testing even new coronavirus cluster appears relatively minor, correspondents say.

source: positive rate going less testing need to. positive rate 5% less testing need to.

And please people - spread news people taking supplement vitamin winter many people deficient really matters. EXACT situation city neighboring areas. stats clearly show lack desired effect lowering cases creating laws mandating masks.

I'd like say, I'm pro-mask, using laws/police mandate them. old people comorbidities die covid, death rates go down. Herd mentality strategy touted White House LMAO 😂  know always easier state obvious: yes, countries, including Germany, taken strong action sooner. try put slightly positive light things, happy Germany government willing take action sooner almost neighbors. now, wait tomorrow night ""wave breaker"" restrictions announced see antisocial I’m like oh wear mask. gloves. I’m tryna catch spread anything. see callous hostile deceitful I’m like I’m antisocial- AVOID callous, hostile deceitful. Guess need revisit dictionary look antisocial. thrown tearful depression today's numbers. called DeSantis left messages angry voice. I'm thinking calling sick work week. (It's zoo COV19 testing center.) Nothing done. thing is, people like reason force early get away softer shorter Lockdowns (like SEA countries). 

People like nothing response people like would wasted time neccessary.
Okay, SPH orders what? every 3 months? government leaders honest, maybe would work they're honest. always lockdown normalcy rinse/repeat nerve surprised people worn constant surprises lack rising like crazy, wont stop half hearted meassures like now.

These measures work numbers low managable, rampant outbreaks. issue lockdowns people seem confused purpose. Lockdowns going eradicate COVID rampant outbreaks occuring, stop outbreak. stopping outbreak stopping COVID same. 

The Western countries delusion early lockdowns alone would stop COVID permanently know case. Even lockdown cases rising, COVID still suppressed yes, SK style system needs place lockdown. Argentina? words, people don’t wear masks gutter trash society want nothing Laschet want lockdown think, pro economy. Water isn’t wet confirm. Ex never wears mask Maybe death rate wrong word. asking total deaths compared number confirmed cases. increase testing probably brings number cases total deaths rate come April May. would concerning hospital capacity helped keep deaths low hospitals starting hit capacity again. Guess : wont reopen current extent winter. air?

What's going realistically happen next two months would make gatherings okay? Bullshit ones think buy nonsense hype  add insult injury, 12 degrees morning

What talking about? gift weather gods. Two biggest wildfires Colorado history got curbed (but put out). Yea Paris nut shell. Great visit, pretty low list places live Europe. Try reading paper, might find view changes. Almost like ""fake news""?

Wonder comes from... Even think it’s fluke it’s odd Denmark big increase cases midst fall vacation, week Skåne exploding.  Everyone Florida wearing masks. I've seen 2 people month inside businesses without mask. I've St Petersburg, Tampa, Orlando Port Charlotte. Florida Man got memo. impressive research coming department fucking obvious. Please, tell bullshit. please, tell virology credentials. Well must used interacting nobody part human nature needs experience socialization human touch. Standing 6ft away mask impedes necessity minimal length require. point? get correction kind laughable, better make correction fault found? 

I get countries kind gave regarding presenting somewhat correct numbers, excess mortality sometimes used (except playing worldometers pandemolympics). bad thing countries try get somewhat correct data sometimes requires corrections might seem silly big picture? trump gonna take buddy’s lead? Hence think it'll need federal law enforcement finally change it. Iirc mask mandates even fatal shooting involving 1918 Spanish Flu. I've reading supplements effects health 15-20 years now, two hundreds I'd absolutely put top recommended list, Vitamin Magnesium. could told that. anti mask people Facebook page bullies High school. People double claiming vaccine fake dangerous. Anti-vaxers foreign disinformation convincing people get it. least 25 30 percent country never volunteer get it. could get high 50+ percent depending convincing disinformation is. every bit nasty DeSantis.

Nonsense stilts. pretty good job. ""I bet pre-existing conditions."" - Every moron social media. OK Trump, manly mandate masks! Empathy sorely lacking around feels like huge part can’t sort damn thing out.

On one hand, obvious cruelty people can’t bothered wear mask grocery store deal without 500 person party. disconnect denial covid anything... that’s empathetic, it’s pretty evil.

But there’s similar tone opposite side well shows screaming right things minor. Obviously lots change pandemic also wish locked properly too, didn’t. people worn masks months avoided events since March told desire kids school, go jobs, socialize comfortably friends summer (or winter), workout decent equipment, take trip big deal, well that’s evil clearly it’s certainly empathic either.

It’s exhausting trying survive mask morons told you’re basically one suggesting anything isn’t 6’ away everyone another year whatever. 

I’m sure everyone thread tired everything ya, little understanding would go would go awfully long way too. people vaccine almost force them. People can't live measurements anymore think antisocial people would rather hide face ""waves"" US, imaginary geographic borders mean absolutely nothing unless response intended cause wave coordinated.

We federal response, therefore looking national numbers determine severity pointless. NYC, Florida, Texas, California, Michigan, etc 2nd wave. Rural areas first. 24 states someone using nicotine gum quit smoking discriminated denied employment.

This FDA approved smoking cessation medication tobacco product Federal state law.

Denying people employment using FDA approved medication ... pure anti-health anti-thinking comparable banning needle exchanges. company done reasonable job well. sent people home could work home. facility, provided safeguards supplies, they've supportive people changing schedules working keep safe. Nothing mind blowing implemented stuff works well. I’m still alive.

Good thing clarified getting bit worried. USA! USA! USA! shudder think numbers we'll see end December, gonna pretty I've learning French almost two months. certainly understood second sentence. state also reported 11,266 negative tests

Thats positivity rate 30% ""Stay inside homes"" said supposed experts. K I’m sorry family deal stress situation. hope everything works best! here! hate everyone...but can't hate they're dead. MASK UP! see reply person asked, study looks pretty good me. necessary... News article-Just recently Russians ordered mask mandate. thought already pushed vaccine? right, level compliance see every day horrid. travel around Denver work see first hand.

This experience. Everyone see masked up. 

I also can't leave place without seeing state plate. Adjusted US population size, 2521 deaths single day. worst single day US April 21st 2742 deaths. absolutely *massive* number realized friends have. ones refuse wear masks become defensive - yep this. that’s good qualities. confirm - water wet, right? Well paper enough take vitamin first sign covid symptoms. supplement winter anyway tested low past. paper says even vitamin level adequate extra may help recover. Yes is. Also certain statistical procedures analyses used don’t get certain threshold can’t make claim Back lockdown sure did, wanted kill every day.

Again, things fine now, won’t lockdown happens again. Another 167,000 US equivalent cases today ""Don't make pull car over!"" - Every parent, ever. say ""I thought already"" saw
 week, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center vaccinated first 12-year-old.
  
Can't believe fast they're moving regardless children focused science museum stayed open town (Vancouver). aquarium huge tourist attraction opened month closed, admitting werent getting sustainable visitor numbers. science center still staying open, think largely run school-based programs, massively cut staff. Fine. Let's get with.

I already get yearly flu shot. Tack covid shot. get one April Oct. &amp; whole cabinet ""really suck"", he's got going him. we're mostly indoors ...? opinion give unquantifiable subject. Fauci said December, WormLivesMatter says April/May... hm. Pfizer says 40 million doses December, WormLivesMatter says 2022...

If educated matter (being sub make educated), spewing shit like confidently? Yeah, boils throwing tantrum shouting ""I like told do"". exact situation - first laughed beginning febuary. Told summer need plan already lock autumn. Nobody cares. world handles pandemic see dark future looking global warming. Fun times ;) Ideally well vaccine. all, Dr. Fauci said vaccine stops, prevents, COVID-19 infections. 9000 * 1000 !!! half measures waste FREAKIN time. Either fully dont anything. Sweetie, post sources. tease us saying something bullshit without evidence. preprint anyone know long would take possible exposer test come back positive?  Got contact tracing call could exposed Friday weren’t sure get tested immediately wait x amount time getting tested.  Obviously going quarantine weren’t sure early get tested. I'm aware that, American living Paris year, stand opinion made be. Yea, may great visit week so, living much different, even money issue. I've travelled Europe Paris pretty far list favorite cities. knows, I'd probably feel differently lived cities well. YMMV  edit post quickly submission * Especially darker skinned individuals. shit. necromancy. people tell clearly policies implement now

Here things would do:

* Mask mandates.
* Unified message encouraging people wear masks (instead president telling people health experts ""idiots."")
* Providing high quality masks free people.
* Extending PPP loans restaurants bars afford closed.
* Give schools enough resources deal flood problems deal in-person learning.
* Nationalized effort cross-train nurses health professionals. Right we're difficult spot enough nurses covid, kind nurses close financial ruin elective health procedures done.
* Pass law makes illegal insurance companies treat Covid pre-existing condition.
* Free healthcare anyone gets Covid. Free testing everyone (even illegal immigrants).
* Extend rent relief renters *and* landlords. 
* Invest nationalized at-home education program kids job retraining program adults. Sweden nothing, number ICU cases/deaths go single digits summer?

And strategy work, Region Skånes numbers similar Denmarks numbers? Wow, that's nuts mom one St. Louis patients. She’s verge needing ventilator since Friday morning. 

Let tell ya, worst thing knowing much struggling one able side. kills thinking lonely scared must be. Well course knows better. knowing better fix lower back issues. exactly perfect, article saying countries female leaders fared [much article months ago. Like found New Zealand Australia fared much better Canada. June brain fog. That's mostly lifted I've seriously seriously flubbed two tech screens even prep work. Worst ever done even since graduate.

Like WTH?

Was super sick December, sick march. Wife serious pneumonia still symptoms.  Evolution means ""change"", ""change better"" even ""change worse"". fat-soluble meaning overdose make sick.

Serious question: fat solubility make (more?) able overdose? Experts already trying warn us, America, potential time bomb Thanksgiving could us. Students returning home college bringing virus small towns, going interacting friends family. Bars, restaurants, house gatherings spreading grounds. going get ugly months. haha what? No, we're not, nobody lives it. live cities. yeah, understand germ theory disease.

but unless there's study i'm unaware of, that's vector covid-19. inhale sufficient amount virus attaches respiratory system.

this warnings going eat. someone covid cough food fine, dangerous breathe in. Florida Group pandemic denial version Florida Man?

Google lot tracking, many people want, use alternatives services. Using AMP, track even more, might even replace ads own, stealing ad revenue site's owners. Since there's consistent way finding original links AMP link, made bot automatically you.  obvious saying different countries mind blowingly obvious asking source like asking paper proving water experts comparing countries, it. experts comparing countries Scandinavia. many different studies, specifically case Coronavirus. source right tells countries comparable enough different outcomes due differences strategy. No, 100% comparable. Two different Swedish cities 100% comparable. differences small enough experts confidently say use different results directly. That’s fact. That’s I’ve saying along. good chance survival equal collapse. want make definition failure would go ahead, proven anything.

You ask system collapsed. asked failed. - failed it’s population completely overestimating need triage, refusing adjust. led hundreds, thousands, dying completely needlessly. I’ve sent proof that. 

You want call failure, that’s you. saying “well system didn’t collapse let people die homes instead hospital beds” sure doesn’t sound like something proud of. impossible unaffected, Sweden among least. tied denmark ending 3rd 0.1% difference. comparison Europe far better.

Yes, tied Denmark. one fifth deaths per capita. sound good you? know lockdown prevent deaths, right? economic damage consequence attempt save lives. damage way deaths terrible outcome. believe actual scientific analysis have, use instead. layman analysis absolutely worthless me. saying consistently said due major differences societies 1:1 comparison worthless.

As noted above, that’s one scientific analysis. I’ve start said people actually know something saying. I’ve never claimed it’s baseless opinion, see would think that. all, far you’ve sent absolutely evidence favour opinion. Makes sense would think I’m same. I’m really not. 

A 100% comparison impossible. Yet experts saying Sweden, Norway Finland, huge differences outcome due differences strategy. me. Experts saying that. failure success purely based rest world.

When comparing strategy best, course should. Would still say strategy success zero deaths example, Finland 12 times amount deaths New Zealand, make Finland failure?

You hard pressed find two countries less comparable Finland New Zealand. suggesting that, allowed compare Sweden Norway, would comparing Finland New Zealand? We’ve seen headline every week, don’t want wear masks listen strangers. It’s going take death loved one. mostly caused global pandemic fucked world. Mistakes made good faith trying fix that, government came thing really knowing do. We're lucky learned mistakes, seems pretty rare based many brothers sisters around world suffering moment lot, maybe even all, countries *also* legal means temporarily suspending freedoms emergency. expect Donald doesn’t mean it’s wrong. president ignoring state mandates, federal guidelines, CDC director, virtually rest world stroke ego news. would nice could stop losing neighbors, coworkers, family members virus would nice president acts like gives shit.

“Here, sign waiver case get sick rally!” way personally wanted it. American way securing personal liberty costs. Emigrate prefer another way. entirely, may side effect messes teeth. know That's optimistic estimate. reminder,

Their Goal originally 30,000 volunteers, reached goal increased 44,000 volunteers, since increased 47,000 volunteers due expanding kids young 12 years old.

Right 42,113 volunteers gotten atleast first dose, 35,771 already gotten second dose, based weekly updating webpage.

I truly believe first vaccine market, dont much longer wait, states vaccine plan functional Nov pulling pants, 0.4% 350 million: 1,400,000

That's why. drug designed take people ventilators major cause death covid. 

2 major causes lead death virus. able breath, ventilator long causing infection leading death. Wherever location is, people needing get healthy guess.... UAE? Ah haw haw haw unable get R0 1 long sloppy border controls, mandatory testing controlled quarantine enforced.

50 Norwegian municipalities struggle outbreaks caused Polish workers. 344 planes landed infected passengers. 

And Solberg government unable unwilling anything it. understanding second shot needed 28 days. Yeah, similar experience. went one day saw loooong line CVS, mostly college-aged folks. years, never saw people line flu shot. Decided time it. came back next day, expecting line, noone there. &amp; 5 minutes. taking words context. 

That anyone thinks vaccine development deployment covidis simple guaranteed foolish. need multi-pronged approach nothing table handle it.

CDC still recommends 10-14 days isolation exposure. refuse isolate currently? people that, yes really never get control.

The contradictory statements many head spin! can't believe know stuff.

That's impressive.

Booker underlying health conditions catching virus. Nah. It’s same. cold flu seasons fall. There’s significant change temperature India summer fall. 43°C (highest May) around 28°C (average high temperature October November) temperature declining around 23°C (average high temperature parts country). yeah fall play role surge infections well Ok, thought analogy spot read aloud SO, read username pass phone bc stop laughing! Good one, u/hotlavatube hear lot NZ, left wondering daily life looks like guys. 
Is everything open running usual? 
Do people still wear masks? 
You obviously local endemic completely control, I’m wondering post horror lifestyle looks like. 
Of course I’m probably still months years out... would thought Italy would one countries would take virus incredibly seriously terrible outbreak start pandemic guess people forget stuff initial official numbers China still suspect. doubt number *new* officially reported cases deaths since March April reasonably accurate. China stomped hard summer flare ups don’t doubt they’re contained. 

This someone despises Chinese government they’ve done Hong Kong, relatives are. definitely get again. It’s pretty rare ore 80 people reportedly died COVID-19 past week Kansas City metro, one-week period since pandemic area encompassing Kansas City Jackson, Clay Platte counties Missouri, well Johnson Wyandotte counties Kansas, recorded total 735 October seen 163 deaths, 81 reported Oct. 20-26, according data maintained Star. second highest number weekly deaths came first week September 55 49,600 COVID-19 cases identified metro Monday.

We don’t whole lot tools use beat pandemic current moment, still don’t know full physiological affects may have. prevent someone’s suffering, wouldn’t you? could create jobs. Downvote away, see US screwed EU.

We get cases way May/June/July, entire point getting caseloads low make test/trace/isolate work.

In EU, got cases super low level, failed every one steps, people let guard down. current surge catastrophic.

We see happens time around, looking happened US July, hoping able make smallish corrections (closing indoor dining gyms, reiterating discouragement informal indoor gatherings) keep cases exploding maintain obviously high level, high level still allows hospitals function.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Americans never understanding. Look boondoggle TSA, instance. Denmark early 90ies. end cold war, military still set it.

I served one non-armed guys go cities firebombed bombed, put fires find people rubble save them.

The assumption never enough ressources save everybody. doctors may dead place medical supplies could burned, general chaos assumption.

Anyway, set medical station tents treating survivors, go bombed place search dig people. 

This first searcher team does:

You go around shout people, find sort 1,2 3. Everybody gets attached number.

1 walk medical place, given couple minutes care, like bandage big bleedings, given directions medical center told go there.
 
That also like people lost eye. find guy eyes blown walk another guy walk eyes, tell eye guy help eye guy get medical center.

2 can't walk saved - like burned lost foot. get 2 location marked map, tell ""we'll get back you!""

3 either possible save much work save. Like burned lost legs gut injury. even small injury, trapped rubble would take long time dig out. 

They get number 3 left die. supposed also tell ""we'll get back you!""

At treatment center they'd always treat 2s ahead 1s, 3s would picked case 1s 2s got done, assumption likely happen.

So chilling job separating people 2 3, especially like edge. Like ""this guy would normally saved, could save 5 guys time takes save him, 5 guys instead guy dies"".

It's almost certainly death sentence get 3. procedure like ""look 30 seconds, make call."" much hate too, schools workplaces need close want slow spread. like March. Closing bars limiting gathering sizes done 2 months ago, definitely late now. may still effect, may reduce R 1.4 1.2, that's it. Besides, people take seriously well. I'm 70+ care work. 

At end, continue accelerate following weeks. happens then, know. Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup I'm sure know I'm asking - they're either inactivated live-attenuated.

The RNA vaccines (Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna, Imperial) live attenuated they're viruses all. protein subunit ones (Novavax, GSK/Sanofi). viral vector vaccines (Oxford/AZ, J&amp;J etc.) live attenuated either, despite including semi-functional viruses. Western COVID-19 vaccine efforts include whole SARS-CoV-2 virus form.

By 'worth trying' mean worth developing, worth giving absolutely everyone. Codagenix developing live vaccine. reinfection already led death, anyone says comes back milder wrong. NYC full workaholics take vacations mean, yes, family. like FB reason trimmed friends list people matter life. Russia scary almost 70k excess deaths scary many cases coronavirus unreported could devastate communities reason it’s bullshit society hasn’t graduated past loosefitting cloth masks. 

We supposed limit N95 thing couple months shortage. 

They widely available, complete lack leadership never changed narrative get people wearing proper masks since. 

So everyone still wearing masks completely unfiltered air coming around edges. It’s hilariously bad joke point. 

I’m surprised people get infected they’re protecting properly. It’s mystery. it’s planes. think 60-70% close friends already told take it. 

None hardcore weirdos. I'm really worried enough Americans board. Please stop spreading misinformation. know mean well stuff mean think means. people getting reinfected apply millions public health level. Please listen Fauci spread stuff think know better reason Oh sub hates point that. 

In case anyone think I'm making said Focused projection. FTFY study also doesn’t even talk antisocial personality *disorder* antisocial personality *traits*. certain number traits define disordered, like saying “people don’t wear masks less empathy” know dumb MFers. wear masks. people dumber thought Ken perfect homologue, wish caught more. title nuts, imagine literally believing kind disorder wearing mask well educated population tends make informed decisions benefit everyone.

There's LOT areas US need demolished built back ground, best place start would education, intelligent people usually better coming smart solutions complex issues, alternative. Conservatives: Nuh-unh ASPD something we're going make policy future? mean ever psychological condition leads Conspiracy mindedness seem biggest threat dealing something like vaccinating Corona Virus. #Science Yeah it’s called asshole I’d inclined link intelligence IQ repeat test, Republicans Democrats lol. bet results same... simply tell stop spreading crack-pot conspiracy theories here, zero basis fact science, offer credible supporting information bar cretins' similarly-*opinion*ated blog, shameful catfish techniques serve LITERALLY lead people dying, closing ""so please fuck nonsense"".

Sometimes get mouthful back (expected fair enough, I've already said fuck off), never respond, since bullshit conversation dies anyway result post. agree

You look struggling bottom class assessing performance. look closest peers excelling top. It’s 8 months, probably like hundred million infections, seen 24 reinfections. Granted number could times higher still. 

Furthermore, T-Cell response seems good. 

I would consider year somewhat long lasting. agree. Sweden politicized scary. seen american liberalsbasically hoping Swedes die prove concervatives wrong.

Why wish Swedes die? explain Sweden lot, heard immunity strateg, lifehere same. want less repressive volontary response also change country vore. I.e higher taxes rich, public health are, employee rights etc. I've also taken unfriending blocking necessary. *really* improves facebook experience. much outright deleting facebook would Cl2 Wow Canada really reckless don’t think lower death rate last. Deaths still lagging hospitalizations.

People saying several months now. see deaths rising slightly, we've increased cases months now. seen spiking deaths already, haven't.

So I'm chalking ""I'll believe see actually happen"". good news, shame ever *needed* field hospital due negligence massive surge. kind issues labeling mass group people label, traits extent, cases people wearing mask pointed directly misinformation ignorance. people intentionally creating misinformation, might actually deserving label. Confirmed positive PCR test showing symptoms (fever, coughing, fatigue etc)  news, science discovered straight men like large breasts. Difficult know causes excess death lots reasons difficult account reduction types deaths. Ex. Initially significant reduction motor vehicle accidents due harsh stay home orders.

For deaths indirectly caused virus, ex. Deaths due delayed surgeries/poverty like mentioned... They're still related pandemic. 

Even someone virus complications, somewhat overly reductionist say cause death covid isolation. Instead covid context comorbidities. Contextualism framework, better worse, expanded almost infinitely antecedents... Consensus wrong word, admit fault there. told side caution avoid going around thinking you’re immune reinfection cases show otherwise. keep mentioning this, know 3 people reinfected within 4 months first getting it. there’s obviously validity there. Sadly money buy end streets institution. Merica mind control nation set free believe lies. Please don’t kids. book smarts far exceeds potential critical thinking skills. someone named Chad, really irritating. It’s linked antisocial traits, much lower bar antisocial personality disorder. want block air vent? Spain, lot actually leave go work Germany.

Here crazy, need university degree involves high standard training - actual job almost always temporary contracts benefits security pretty low pay.

My nurse, I'd never recommend children. Nobody denying that. Whataboutism nonsense, though. I’m fan Trump Fox, anyhow. making joke based recent events. Yes, pair people getting reinfected (I personally know 3), suggests aren’t immune get it. know. reason know vaccine roll outs happen reasonably successful there's way much money table, terms actual vaccine restoring worlds' economies. Money powerful motivator planet, there's much stake dozens vaccines fail. least he’s trying. US seems barely taken measures. Israel's Intelligence Special Missions Directorate (also known Mossad) obtained Chinese vaccine neoconjunctivitis brought back begin ""research,"" according report Russia Today (RT) citing local media.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Israeli media Channel 12 reported Monday Mossad brought Chinese vaccine Israel recent weeks. unclear exactly intelligence agency acquired vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple government sources ""indirectly"" confirmed report local media. vaccine reportedly procured order study formulation explore vaccination options. addition this, senior Israeli Ministry Health official confirmed Israel seeking purchase neocrown vaccine countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Israel reportedly developed new coronavirus vaccine, testing process still early stage. Last week, Israeli Institute Biological Research (IIBR) Nesbitzona announced new coronavirus vaccine, called ""Brilife. vaccine received necessary approvals, first phase clinical trials expected begin next week. First, vaccine tested 100 volunteers, goes well, additional 1,000 people enrolled second phase trial next spring.

&amp;#x200B;

　　In recent weeks, sharp increase number new coronavirus infections Israel, total number cases reaching 310,000. number relatively small compared worst-affected countries, quite significant country 8.9 million people, represents 3.4 percent total population. feel like many restrictions around Europe seem working. They're closing public life infections currently spreading mainly private life situations. 

I'd even go say risky meet someone home restaurant least distancing measures. Thanks, appreciate it. Notice careful language source is. ""suggests"", ""might"". That's medical consensus, that's leaving possibility open.

And even certain, single study medical consensus either. example, [here proving antibodies produced least half year. also careful language, provide explanation result differs, note study also limitations.

That reinfections occur proof either, they're expected, mean people immune.

Consensus high bar clear. simply know yet. Read “Murder Media”. Name checks sure Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

People acting like one time thing fucking us all. ""Its personality disorder, condition""

So tell retail workers. ""good thing"" get sick, show symptoms faster.

But, long deadly/dangerous before, spreading easily, bad. Especially number asymptomatic cases quite high particular virus. Username doesn’t check out. understand people thinking ever ending. still Flu seasons every year. assumption Covid19 mutate overtime less harmful years. 9/11 virus it'll never again. mask compliance higher France Germany, Italy etc can't contain defeat it. /s
If die defeating loser. problem telling people back fuck up, put mask properly, get fuck away me. People/the government pussyfooting around telling people right thing normalize shitty behavior. Yeah see that, definitely people here, really depends circle. People hang social media ever seems influence people joke, example, nowhere friend defending trump sudden like fuck happened used extremely left. Personality disorders strictly empathy/emotions. parents summer months school? I’ll take lockdown Nothing else rumored, tomorrow Merkel meet prime minsters discuss new measures. dont know his/her situation. he/she 80 years obese asthmatic? Odds he/she gonna die. Seriously fuck Murdoch media trying undermine effort go far basically inciting open rebellion. they're different. Gosh. person personality disorder, comments hurtful mean.
 
Mental health stigma real. snowflake. know got social skills tell point want make measures, besides masks closure bars/restaurants? people mostly still going work play normal (and perhaps without masks), that's already quite big gap there. Well...he make america 'the greatest' fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

Wear mask.

Wash hands.

Dont drink bleach. skeptical anything said week US election arguing coworker politics everything mentioned might exposure heavy metals drinking water said ... well yeah notified lead levels water really high.

This honestly might issue least rural Michigan. imagine covid19 (19!!!) end 2020. losers lol Damn. Much extended family lives Cook. Schaumburg. Including 90 year old grandpa thinks invisible. everything always US confusing me

Clearly. What's that? Profits important company drives innovation? fascinating... thinking companies going sink billions vaccine free. Welcome real world, companies shitty things, Mercedes made tanks Nazis yet company alive better ever. Johnson Johnson obviously something shitty, difference 99% work ground breaking health changing. want take vaccine, don't, discouraging others taking due unsubstantiated belief one product (out hundreds) dangerous defect immediately proves products dangerous allow virus continue spread kill millions. Alot xD still dont see people wearing masks stores Reinfected Strain Strain F?

That important. Last heard 8 strains covid-19 there, immunity one guarantee immunity others....hence vaccine offered nothing snake oil.

&amp;#x200B;

If talking infected different strains realistically 'reinfection' per say body's point view. I'm man. Covid huge annoyance point. I'm ready done. Life needs go on. I'd angry friend's reckless driving left paralyzed. wearing small piece cloth face social distancing four months year small price pay save lives? 

Hahahaha. No. ridiculous statements:

* save people Diabetes, banning sale consumption donuts.

* save people Heart Disease, one person per table order hamburger hours 12:00PM 4:00PM.

* save people skin cancer, people MUST wear long sleeves pants time outdoors.

* save people car accidents, MUST wear government approved helmet. 4 pounds... get small price pay!


The entire premise absurd. Reminds driver heard radio crazy person driving traffic. looked cars screamed: ""It's one, there's many them!"" That's saying, saying people wear masks, higher proportion personality disorders proportion general population. US expat living Ireland, thanks Covid I’ve seen family year. Articles like reaffirm I’m making right choice flying back home putting family risk. Still sucks tho normalized mass death next virus shows kills 5% people, 1-1.5%, much easier say ""too expensive anything, die""

Or climate change. mean, that's strategy far. sources? remote helped we’d advance warning thing started seeing significant uptick community cases, we’d example Italy see likely happen didn’t move honest closed borders thing NZ early actually pretty poorly done, we’ve learned gotten better time gone on. we’d relied remote island, we’d broken. 205 known cases locked (edit: March 25th), enough kick create full blown outbreak. closing borders, “being remote”, point, never going biggest important thing lockdown, social distancing, community support elderly vulnerable. broke back virus forced R0 1. We’re back living normally, expect economy recover quickly albeit pandemic causing world wide economic slowdown.

Many European countries exactly same. Denmark locked around mid-March hundred cases deaths. Austria.

Unfortunately, islands middle nowhere, reopen point. are. New Zealand basically small European country, middle ocean. say easter? Maybe referring 2024. How? depressing explain obvious shit like tht lol Basically neither good bad news, enough infections yet reach threshold interim analysis.

Of course, wildly optimistic scenario, vaccine amazingly effective infections recorded placebo arm. However think likely infection rates simply lower expected. got 2 experimental drugs steroid. know about. Depends mean.

Current projections vaccines available general population (rather healthcare workers essential workers) goes smoothly - April / May 2021.

But expecting anyone wants vaccine, taken it? Sure, closer year.  I'm waiting either half-measure vaccines (and truly feel potent first) treatments (much likely effective. one wants infected least treatment alleviate symptoms/effects lot). South asian countries well controlling spread. Kudos!!  don’t need vaccinate everyone. get elderly high-risk people vaccinated, enough full reopening, close it. actions say otherwise There's also fact huge proportion population scientifically illiterate, really understand what's presented, assume understand conspiracy. Like guy New Zealand screaming Koch' postulates, people calling 'casedemic' people picking choosing studies thinking different studies contradictory results means someone's lying bad work, taking every study definitive evidence truth (if supports pre-existing view) understanding exponential growth deaths lag behind case numbers etc etc. see many people posting graphs 'scientific explanations' stuff completely ridiculous illogical understand people they're presenting understand - easy dupe people fake science bullshit, point things like errors changing consensus evidence sort conspiracy. respirator filter recommend? Im risk group go house hunting soon move job Ireland wasnt screening anyone coming in. care coronoa. know someone arrived Ireland 3 weeks ago testing all. Lmao dude youre acting weird imo it’s confusing work restaurant alot avoid infections (spaced tables, good ventilation, wear masks, disinfect everything etc.) Toa point almost impossible infected, yet another lockdown, boss already said quit business good obviously loses less money so. Imagine working restaurant whole life get savings erased lockdown barely effect spreading virus. achieved two consecutive days 0 cases 4 month strict lockdown (all retail closed, everyone WFH, hospitality delivery only) Victoria, Australia. 

It’s possible done. It’s way virus foothold community. Damn CCP right thing it’s right thing without needed global superpowers watch actions. VIC aim total elimination errr side caution... stay shut another week so? Arn't going end back square one months time theres couple cases still floating about? Americans need start taking seriously. need time buy stock options untraceable accounts double half stock overnight Stay strong/kämpa på Danskar! that’s true hasn’t widespread reinfection now? getting number vaccines already manufactured hundreds millions anticipation eventual approval. Yes please. hard think may take 6 months. downvotes? understand Norway Sweden following strategy mid March, Norway changed approach. remember rightly Norway way cases per head population early March Sweden. Intelligence emotions necessarily linked: stop laughing couple days ago saw article mentioning ""Third wave"" Mechanisms different. Outcomes may same. gonna Rona season every year. One passed away heart attack, infection + aids. late roommate passed away hospice well services never interrupted. I'm touching vaccine year available everyone quite significant population 5 million. 


If scale US numbers (330 million), comparable around 28500 new cases one day. (the US number Sept. 08). 


Further steps taken, especially cities, mandatory work home businesses (as long possible), masks mandatory grocery-stores etc possible keep 1 meter distance. Mandatory masks public spaces possible keep 1 meter distance, reduction allowed number people groups etc. 


Hopefully help curb increase. (it helps area country sparsely populated, infection near bigger cities).  10%?

6% said. infected. obviously teachers would get infected. Oh...is anti-psychotics sold TV ads there?

Always wondered culture advertises many drugs, suggests people go beg doctor may experience long list side effects order cope one smaller issue. heheh!!

Be smart primate. Wear mask reduce risk infection 'for you'. Stock market slipped hard yesterday, ought get things top moving. personality disorder suffer from? really included antisocial headline, missing they've lumped load different illnesses here, probably among first receive vaccine (freelance Healthcare contractor. last attempt creating law regarding vaccine ""people working healthcare/nursing need prove vaccination immunity employer""; eventually kick me, too. guess Disease Control put quite effort signaling towards self-employed contractors we're checked directly... yes, I'd prefer traditional vaccines rDNA one we've got decades field testing... admit I’m surprised impressed. cultural political issues make approach US impossible even could rewind clock know everything know now. Tragically it’s going burn population. Probably another 400K dead spring US. Humans always stupid. expected coronavirus smarter people.

Just sure get point ? Depressing af... know safety comes first pandemic ruining college experience can't see friends want to... music major sucks right now. four known “Human Coronaviruses” circulate every year cold flu season. tend cause mild common cold symptoms people. They’ve studied rigorously since 1950s. Short term immunity them, well known well documented proven scientific fact. fact even recent exhaustive study years ago, found people gotten sick exact virus strand twice one year. caught got sick early spring time, later year fall got another cold gene sequencing showed exact betacoronavirus.

With said, SARS-CoV-2 different Human Coronavirus. It’s SARS-like Coronavirus, extremely rare exotic strains found bats camels shit. cause severe disease possible body develops robust memory cells response it.

*But...* it’s possible doesn’t.

Scientists idea short term immunity human coronavirus. could simply human immune systems simply didn’t evolve deal coronavirus centuries. zoonotic viruses meaning mutates point past maybe couple hundred years ago, start infecting humans.

The thing is, right here, right know long immunity truly lasts SARS-CoV-2. absolutely idea. measure antibodies. measure memory cells. track long things last. don’t actually KNOW presence actually prevents us getting sick. likely won’t know quite time.

What know small handful scientifically proven re-infections SARS-CoV-2. don’t know that’s exceedingly rare, it’s common observed.

I think won’t know things least year mass vaccination. want get Mr. Bones' Wild Ride. point content seems feel superior anti-mask crowd

The point study convince persuade anyone anything. point scientific method. 


Whoever told really fucked perspective purpose medical research. did, add info already knew. change feel  420th wave WEED 

I see there. Can't trick trickster. Yes correct. That's americans catch bad covids wear face diapers they're supposed to!!!! First all, study show even 2 types covid19, secondly, maybe protect mask, faceplate, hands desinfectant, like everyone 'They're sides coin'
-Singaporean Health Minister Earn urn it! Honestly think that’s group think effect. people make fun people wearing mask questioning manhood everyone confirms outspoken ones. It’s human condition I’m guessing goes back tribal days. Someone PhD better explanation I’m sure. one us name calling it’s me. Also, please stop trying put words mouth.  persons first infection mild, may build enough memory cells. Hes wrong, basically waiting everyone get first one. good news Andrew Cuomo NY effectively offered elderly tribute collect data effective treatments. Absolutely. comes ""original english food"" said horrible. Lucky thing Brits is, empire imported good kitchens (like curries, said good UK, haven´t eaten one though). Also: something heard Church. People hooked liberty. like junkie says clean secretly buying fix lowdown.

Liberty spoiled people. generation never faced high levels disease war. They're mentally able make sacrifices required.

Like watching B-52 overhead refusing go shelter. Pathetic. Yeah, still 142,000 cases US equivalent live Bavaria fully expect close bars/restaurants here. stance replacing terrible mental health care nothing aall right choice? I'd argue lateral best. certainly better options, sadly someone would pay it. again, America, best (justice, government, healthcare) money buy. Fuck Zuck. Fun fact: Shut fuck dumbass mention specific person? 

As FDA - approving plasma therapy strong objections scientists one example political influence decision making. bad decision backed recent studies showing plasma therapy ineffective.

Approving hydroxychloroquine emergency use another example.

Also, specifically mentioned political appointees career scientists.

You reading good amount bias isn’t one sentence. father's cousin wife tested positive March week two ago. blew mind since thought pretty much impossible two catch virus again. wanted publish something subreddit learned simultaneous reinfection since seemed statistically unlikely suggested might much easier currently believed get infected twice, subreddit allow publish post without link. I've seen positive test results, wife sent mother back March October. Disgusting. I'm glad eating read that. buck stops where? Oh that's right, republicans take responsibility things go right....pun intended There's difference vaccine's approval, distribution. It'll take around year everyone actually get it. Fakebook. true? absolutely right, time right extra careful Fun fact: valved masks lower droplet output cotton/cloth ones government wants wear. ban valved masks lets particles escape would ban efficacy-based logic.

RLF100 stops viral replication lungs. Covid replicate body. sick people died. bid DT thinks thankful got virus him, beautiful virus deep, unless know anything horrible places world would better without facebook. looking well. I'm virologist, I've read past immunity rely entirely antibodies. simple words, people dont want wear mask assh\*les still important one, may make outcomes much worse many, many people. like ""oh well antibodies, let's boot back T-cell immunity!"". work conjunction eachother, missing either bad news long term immunity. nothing conclusive, certainly *bad* news. circle goes anti-mathematics. I'm tired surfing wanna get ocean!!! Go eat fruit beach chill!!!!!!! hate phrasing, too. However, eliminates “that,” word editors hate. true would fantastic news. can’t second wave never stop first one. Exactly.

Awwwww poor thing Ah, bad. confused sociopath antisocial. never see assholes claiming Australia may fudging data, comes countries like Vietnam India, whenever there's optimistic news, dude always needs comment ""poor nations x cannot afford test people, must fudging data."" makes sad :( 1870: ""We flying cars 21 century""

Show proof statement made.  still important T-Cell immunity much damaging host. Antibodies take free floating viral particles body. T-Cells kill infected cells, eg, lung tissue infected SARS-Cov-2, T-Cells kill lung tissue stop virus. 

I really understand B-cells would help. B-cell produces antibiodies needed.

In ideal world, we'd T-cell antibody immune responses. Missing either makes disease harder fight worsens prognosis many people. Temperaturewise, India year round, seasonality viruses really play role europe. Sure, parts see cooling winter monsoon season thing, think factors play there.

the oxford vaccine already that.  i'm taking one. Considering years normally takes get health products approved, I’m wary. one knows long term effects vaccines. It’s shot dark. It’s like using HIV virus cure cancer. one doesn’t kill you, probably will. direct evidence show 30% NYC it. entire state 533K confirmed cases. Surely higher 30% NYC it, alone would third entirety confirmed cases US. Unlikely. good days up. down. appreciate good thoughts. I'm aiming ""middle pack"" making terrible year. /s......?

Because lockdowns aren’t solution. Lockdowns meant buy time communities get prepared things open (PPE all, plexiglass businesses, understanding true risk virus different age groups, eventually vaccines treatments). 

Eventually we’re going face music - need make sure proper protection so. 

Lockdown cases opening never going work. aren’t going eradicate virus way (or way). do. Despite rhetoric ""I love children bla bla bla"", turns out, almost nobody wants around 24/7. Especially Karen, gets middle mom-wine brunches. less single person wears mask country. might see ONE hundreds hundreds lucky go outside.

Yeah, sounds like pretty weak study me. This. Waves basically something people made explain virus trends. Honestly kind tired public’s obsession them. contradicted yourself.

I used taco bell insinuate work health industry reeling covid right now. 

Your ""I need vaccine affect me"" really great attitude.  Upvote seen. world cares lot less probably think. 5 hours.

To quote South Park ""what people, diabetic?!"" Also OP: indicate beginning plateau. 

Reality: Fastest rate increase reported cases highest single day total entire epidemic...

Yep... rose coloured glasses. What's purpose even asking question? goodness, people raise risk people getting sick possibly even dying it. happens sure make money make less money later makes sense either. explains decision put Migrationsverket there. best thing Swedish knowing never deal Migrationsverket see people terribly affected downsides strict lockdown guess can't wrap head around people oppose lockdowns despite living chaotic mess start pandemic horrifying events took place early months pandemic about, instead another planet, send people Corona-palooza. We're lockdown anyways, people working anyways. set concert stages middle nowhere truck water cheap food let party infect month. 

Rip band aid, fast.  Second round lockdowns politically impossible. People still angry first round, promised “two weeks” turned year.

Only hope left vaccine. vaccine development full speed US, don’t know EU doing. world holds breath selfish America first museum mentioned brooklyn museum, endowment 100 million. yearly operating expenses 40 million i'd say fine even customers. presumably could cut operating expenses circumstance. surely grant funding still come through, galas, 25% attendance let last several years without extraordinary measures government assistance (which already begging for) Except there's school liability. reason school cancelled due snow days. much risk someone getting injured. scream loudest kids person school likely first threaten lawsuits kids get sick. Went football game. Everything distanced masks mandated, masks saw everyone wear *pathetic*. loose fitting could breathe around them, people *still* took ""dick nosed"" every time considered huffing puffing stairs (it's 30 stairs FFS, dear god we're bad shape!).

No wonder people think masks nothing. masks many people using *do* nothing. Even CDC's toothless recommendations involve *tightly* fitting mask, almost nobody actually bothers with. right (excluding today's deaths) Sweden 0.2 deaths/100k cumulative 14 days translates 20 deaths 14 days (source ECDC). Last tuesday 5. 
And yes increasing lately, especially Uppsala's peak showing, adding 5 deaths (in region 370k people). Really? side effects showed trials? die too! utterly irrational. 

There's logical hiccup think they're immune they're main character story thus die horrible wheezing death like normal person. Discarding 31 ""zombies"" 4 deaths per day time. expecting almost zero deaths mark last entire winter still. see tomorrow cross-check death register Thankfully T-Cell response still solid. anyone interest Sky News Australia (News Corp) behaved week leading Melbourne easing restrictions; 100+ hours strict potentially dangerous handling COVID information. “Not wearing mask linked antisocial traits, study finds.”

That study found. You’re saying it’s propaganda implication took away head means everyone wearing mask “bad person” makes emotional. You’re basically saying can’t discuss legitimate findings plain language don’t like implication headline. What’s thing facts caring feelings? Actually offensive US refer sitting president Mr. President title. big deal Obama. agree, however, appropriate Trump, considered shade here. saying pool eventually full shit nothing done. response like making everyone hold breath drown stop getting shit them.

Probably clandestine manner rouse U.S. anger. I'm sorry going this. Hope starts getting better soon.  30% nyc it. People about. haven’t reinfections.

Stop doom porn. Regardless outcome glad it’s coming election. Politics way much factor important outcome. Except side effects bigger risk 70 crowd disease case. Where's new record high? need another 2 weeks? “People get sick die anyways, shouldn’t try make changes.”

Herd immunity achieved combination infections immunizations. still guarantees vaccine developed, vaccine available take years manufacturer distribute. 

Consider Rockland, New York, 5.4% population tested positive COVID-19. actual number people infected likely higher. fewer people need vaccine Rockland, NY achieve sort herd immunity places. literally DOZENS us! 
See side. right, covid could accelerate that. give up. 

I better answer. people plain narcissists.... worth mentioning 2.7% population first place. chances previously infected person going get reinfected still statistically unlikely simply spread significantly broad enough yet. 

Clearly certain factors consider, habits people pre- post- infection, whether taking precautions on. 

Let us also consider person infected this, may even seek tested again, suspect reinfection can't possibly COVID again, suspect COVID bad seek tested again, resources tested another time, etc. There's also pretty stringent criteria evidence required clearly show infected twice.

Currently, many factors little evidence suggest one way imo. Oh man, know even start :D 

But region seems updating reports larger periods report deaths (probably ones hospitals) fast. previously several large positive reports (adding death count) summer - +14 16/7, +20 29/7, +10 30/9. bit joking someone updating numbers holiday breaks. surprised positive update corrected person reporting FHM report correct criteria FHM (which happened Skåne correct numbers well). Agreed would national holiday moving forward think writing, New Jersey lost [1,849 per 1,000,000 Covid. That's 1 540 people *across whole population*, among got sick.

The fact vaccine trials halted dosing tens thousands participants means certainty way fewer 1 540 sort severe side effect vaccine.

You keep fearmongering potential low-incidence side effects vaccine. I'll keep pointing death high-incidence side effect Covid. 4 people hundred + saw grocery store wear masks.

Everyone needs hospitalized hospitalized go home infect entire family, entire families die.

And no, pointing small countries Europe count look upside down, looks like upvote! care make people sick cause die. personally think kind sick homicidal fantasies they're acting on. Like *know* they're causing death, they're enjoying it. truly sick pieces shit. much vitamin would needed grown man ca 2x population....

Great idea, worked well first time round.

Incredible... people listen Right working adapting locally spread infection looks different country. far, differences great, many regions increase.
