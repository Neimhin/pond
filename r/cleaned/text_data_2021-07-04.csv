I'm afraid lot learn sad lesson. Best luck. hospitalizations breakthrough many ? giving us data yet... Regardless anyone's stance anything pretty dismaying seeing people less wish death others.. Guess I’m imagining us vaccine rollout envy world. 

But go Kids 12 live airborne super spaghetti monster AIDS. Supply Pfizer/Moderna AstraZeneca? latter previously restricted 60s Australia per instruction national medical association. association changed tune opening availability political one Morrison government? surprising Northeast Pacific Northwest made it. CDC link findings? Last checked, told vaccinated, safe.  US started herd stupidity. think there’s many caveats understanding airborne transmission know it. think it’s fair leave quotes think retrospect, send wrong message. crackpot theory comment reference fact people (Jimenez, Bar-Yam, Ding) recently promoted anti-vaccine talking points reason idea it’s NPI vs vaccines debate, reality, personal risk protection public health safety additive. Vaccines best tool far, masks help well.  Even 0.000000000000000000001 entire world. me, whole world.  CDC says 54.9% least ""herd stupidity"".
That's perfect way describe it! one got takes longer. Everyone know getting bumped since last week I'm calling Monday man, want shots point. keep squeaky wheeling kept saying I'm due yet. :/ People: Panic 2020, praying get vaccine

Get effective vaccine, 70% adults get including 90%+ vulnerable. 

People: Still panic kids 12 vaccinated may help anecdotal (for one), psoriasis vaccine (Moderna) cause problems me. Now, mine bad enough crippling reason may help, react *at all*. might worth getting second opinion pharmacist another doctor least.  really necessary comment US every post sub?  It’s safe. far 3.6 *BILLION* doses administered. far dangerous shot, you. don’t get vaccinated could responsible making people sick. Ouch. Grasping straws mate, admit got called knowing you’re talking about. It’s state. pathetic. entitled americans. People countries would kill vaccines make political issue. PATHETIC. approved make easier enforce. California variant aka Epsilon replaced contagious Alpha, Delta, variants.

Since Covid NZ risk blood clots AZ significantly higher risk dying Covid here. massive outbreak risk AZ would justified would lower disease. since NZ Australia massive shipments Pfizer coming justification take risks AZ young people. think makes sense bar country serious COVID outbreak also lacks infrastructure provide legitimate proof vaccination. Also, country significant issue fake vaccinations. countries used significant amount lower efficacy vaccine. simple answer, like youre allowed take want, side effects TBA approved. alot people inject TBA veins politician? don’t know effects covid-19 years either.

I'm guessing get end 2021 hopefully less less serious. dont worry, move onto two letter progression. Alpha Alpha, Alpha Beta, Alpha Gamma etc. don’t know long takes infected people test positive expect it’s two weeks that’s long people quarantine last checked. 

WRT testing, 3 types tests:


- **PCR: won’t test positive vaccination**.  up-the-nose, expensive, accurate coronavirus test finds virus itself. vaccine won’t make PCR test return positive vaccines don’t inject viruses. (Ok, do, they're altered can't cause positive result.) 

- **Antigen: won’t test positive vaccination** vast majority time: rapid tests. Antigen tests return positive detect protein created virus. vaccine won’t cause antigen test return positive vaccines don’t inject viruses there’s virus body create proteins antigen tests detect.  Antigen test edge case: vaccines insert antigen around temporarily (right shot), don’t increase number time, tend local injection site. 

- **Antibody: test positive vaccination**: blood test. Antibody tests tell you’ve infected past detecting antibodies virus. vaccine would cause antibody test return positive result vaccine stimulates immune system create antibodies. that's number shots given overall. number people vaccinated total.  Yes, did. ask help, probably waving get away door, invaded personal space pandemic. seen struggling door jumped personal space help I'd sympathy you. Nobody denying airborne transmission main route transmission. It’s literally guy others Zero Covid group like Kim Prather Deepti Gurdasani used terminology actively downplay vaccines convince people NPIs better vaccines. he's fully vaxxed yet. draw Canadian flag like boss though. Edit: got it. Holy shit really variant every letter Greek alphabet There's reason can't happen. obvious conclusion applying theory evolution.

The hope time does, would indistinguishable common cold. Already seems plan lot neighbors. Texas seems looking rather purple lately... coworker vaccinated? Complimentary covid tourists take back home beyond.
The world truly connected. Unfortunately case, good thing.
Dropping mask distance smart thing.  I’m saying, since grammar sucked, too. I'm contemplating whether refusing cover covid symptoms insurance clause. Sure precedent could abused, specifically failing vaccinate covid could, sounds like personal failing insurance liable for. really is. designed way purpose stop populous states bullying ones. wanted states entity equal other, regardless lived there. think see states way founders did.

I ain't even American, skin game, intended outcome. change? Probably, wish luck world trying make happen.  Pennsylvania one states. 75.8%. shit, really? Well I'm glad say was, then.  logic led government literally nothing stop spread virus. Yeah dude, surely DeSantis fault right nowhere US mask wearing obligated Weird since Pfizer suppose 3 weeks later Moderna's 4 weeks, sometime June received May. True. Makes want leave country entirely. learned medicine engineers different definitions risk. 

Haha touche. always hold true, stereotype real 12-ish percent risk relative someone vaccinated, call low risk. 

I think meant say 12% risk relative someone *unvaccinated*? 

I would concur pure stats, disagree contextually based life impact. 88% decrease chance symptoms relative control population extremely good considered vast majority control population already symptoms. stats get even better comes hospitalizations rates vaccinated daily activites?

Driving low hanging fruit, though kind cringe use we've turned meme sub now. Winter sports could another. Less 8 weeks go get here. feel safe road. Correct. US “the highest death rate”, claim us simply false. 

The US around 18th highest death rate per capita, caveat countries like India Russia likely significantly undercounted deaths thus represented I’m packed baseball game right now.  Metro, fractionally reliable Daily Mail. *Very* fractionally. Troof. USA!

Finally cases are, dangerous get vaccinated. could easily live lot less get close eliminating people would get vaccinated.  Alberta well T-Cell epitopes gonna save us There's multiplicative calculation vaccinated people co-mingling. statement relies assumption vaccinated people equal risk spreading COVID others *if* get symptomatic cases. assumption already puts us back small scoped group analysis going much worse real world, national population stats. Yeah old people getting vaccinated main thing Promoting intercontinental air travel climate emergency. Bold strategy, Cotton  really understand confusion here. thesis one thing normal?   I've already seen like 10 ""I hesitant get vaccine, got covid"" articles week. saw ""I take virus seriously, got do"" many, many times height pandemic. care effects them, even die believing Covid never existed. stop air freight they're well source Sydney outbreak unvaccinated driver ferrying freight crew hotel quarantine.   despite hearing particular fear echoed everywhere year never seen single sourced, definitive claim likely even possible coronavirus variant completely escape vaccine protection guess I’m looking selfish perspective. last time saw elderly mother 2019. doesn’t matter. However, friends family tell “fortress” mentality making people think getting vaccinated low priority. all, virtually Covid Australia. foreign tourist dependent businesses went bankrupt last year, opening doesn’t really matter now. left Australia 1976 returned twice year since then, 2019. I’m sad depressed may another year visit family there. not. Sorry make clearer. unlikely. Surround vaccinated people. Yeah get Indonesia, reached herd stupidity back April 2020! Wait, vaccinated?   CDC guidance immunocompromised (by condition medication) consult doctor probably continue precautions. Patients blood cancers organ transplants well taking certain medications seem especially vulnerable decreased response increase detectable antibodies — 54% overall — second shot, number transplant recipients second study whose antibody levels reached high enough levels ward SARS-CoV-2 infection still well what’s typically seen people healthy immune get antibody test neucleocapsid antibodies only. doctor able order you. tested positive covid fully vaxed. answer questions tell promote vaccines. 

The Deets normal questions:

I got fully vaxed March (Pfzier). wearing Mask since beginning pandemic even getting vaccinated. 

I work pretty risky industry though. see thousands people week hospitality industry often intoxicated wearing masks. 

I Oklahoma. quite close noted hotspots delta variant (Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas), isn’t yet known that’s caught. state health department test PCR variants. Pcr came back positive, variant testing takes 10 30 days. can’t say got Delta not, yet. 

My symptoms mild beginning (sore throat). wouldn’t even gotten tested coworker two hadn’t tested positive themselves. 

I lose sense taste smell four days quarantine. worst part ordeal. hope senses come back, however, grateful suffer like coworkers have. One hospitalized one almost was. 

I 38, male, non smoker (of either), bmi 27.3, drink twice week. two days drinking 5 10 drinks day (I’m trying cut down). 

Mods, willing verify sensitive info privately need .  Moderna larger dose, Pfizer smaller dose.

Moderna may start good efficacy earlier. 

Both excellent would recommend internet doctor. Nothing wrong either. hope ""vaccine hesitant"" point inevitable flood articles we're going see coming weeks months sad fate proudly refused vaccine got bad case Covid. 

It's likely they'll dismiss cries ""pre-existing conditions"" whatever, hope springs eternal people wake hell already. Oh glad bring too. addition deaths you’ve deal with, keeping kids school year also normal. overwhelmed healthcare systems also normal. Dying home overwhelmed healthcare systems also normal. Big true effectiveness studies I've seen 3 weeks. Immunity continues increase many weeks afterwards. Something keep mind. go medical professionals tell us. got tested urgent care doctor specifically stated vaccine keep people getting bad enough need go ICU. first time I've seen that...including sub.  Mixing done mass scale Canada, Germany, UK. far know safe also really effective. Sounds little backwards, hey, like it'll harm. people need new ears. Good idea! hate spinach. can’t imagine weird lose taste smell. coworker got last year things taste different now. Like certain sodas can’t drink anymore great diet. good clarification. turn...

What happened young males ended heart issues? OB following science regarding vaccines pregnancy, might want look different OB. Oh noo !

Anyway... last time caps halved VIC stopped taking flights again, earth expect govt step time? bat eyelid Emirates pulled out. Many vulnerable Australians still waiting flights home  really understand confusion here. thesis one thing normal?  never stopped wearing except travel stores? Public transit? Oh hell yeah things staying on. never stopped wearing except travel stores? Public transit? Oh hell yeah things staying on. short - good society, sacrifice individuals might complications vaccines.

It's approved, fully tested may cause unknown harm. authorized use, whatever harm may cause individuals likely less harm epidemic cause society. Right, think Australian perspective they’ve still come top. might months open up, haven’t lost half million citizens either. Personally filed one away ""Aliens impregnated girlfriend"" story breaking time. guys arguing semantics

And yes, vaccines work great, work lot better everyone takes them. live Missouri, can’t imagine earth godforsaken state would worth spending vacation money on. Maybe I’d say coming STL see Cardinals game, way they’ve playing lately.

Thank spending money elsewhere, stupid state doesn’t deserve it.  long vaccinated contacting virus? really understand confusion here. thesis 600,002 things normal? Thanks, I'm fairly adept risk analysis day job. way Im looking it, close risk long covid/50 person event par needing medical attention car accident per trip. What's unfortunate me, stay way long, since Delta variant likely take vaccination rate (even natural immunity) enough. mask policy, likely would 50% overall mask effectiveness. US dropped mask policy early, think we'll pay come fall. 

Best calculate 66% US Imimmune, assuming vaccine infection 88% effective, 50%of pop covid. means 20-22% population needs get infected vaccinated we'll herd immunity levels Delta. Plus age factor risk dude’s 80. Jabs, jabs, jabs, like jabs arms...jabs, jabs, jabs! gather swarms...

I'm Utah, guy head Utah Coronavirus Task Force last year. repeatedly failed take guidance Utah Department Health political reasons. curiosity, get third dose antibodies? get antibody test comes back wait certain time.

Good-fucking-luck   Moderna doses kicked butt. Ended hospital observation dose two walloped me. anyone freaks out, wasn’t life threatening, odd. Yeah risk drive store car covid kill now. I'm going give driving risk I'm going back masks, walled house fear tiny covid risk either. US Indonesia?

Regardless area you’re referring - approval talking about?  Coming guy written 5 pages response 3 copy paste sentences. doesn’t even deliberate. many confirmed cases diagnostic capacity. don’t capacity mass testing, course numbers low. Classic Florida  Right point evolution ""mutation"" - ""mutation"" + ""natural selection"". think misinterpreting sentence. ""That change"" == mutation. open Bali soon tourists - going carnage. Another blue wave headed way. Thanks Covid! Yes, 20 states have. even past it, albeit small amount. Ideal? No. we're moving foward. It’s true, variant arise unvaccinated people. covid continues host bodies, “explore” space, mutate (evolve) time. That’s it’s imperative lower transmission rate extinct virus. tools investigated use lowering transmission. Vaccines (*with informed consent), testing, social distancing, masks close quarters, getting outside, vitamin D, test existing (well-tolerated, long safety track-record) treatment medications ive rm ectin, whoops talk type. 

There’s bitter pill though. still possibility mutation arrises (evolves) /because/ vaccine. oracles here, probabilities—of welcome research debate public forums. better way hone understanding (and position) shape competing ideas? 

One hypothesis is, could similar antibiotic resistant “superbugs”. people use antibiotics, start feel better stop taking them. enough bacteria isn’t killed, remaining bacteria “learn” defeat antibiotics. resistant strains spread person person, official variants. 

In case covid. people exposed Covid second shot? necessarily full strength resistance. like superbugs… Show enemy hand, better extinct it. would need investigated. doesn’t seem like unreasonable question ask? 

But someone thinks asking questions problem, page. case, don’t question anyone’s (or your) intent, I’m sure come best intentions. Welfare world, community, family, self. 🙏 Oh goodness. I'm sorry. :( Chill. That's common misconception, exit polls recent elections showed born raised Texans voted Democratic Texans born elsewhere Seems fair, whenever another country mentions covid-restrictions necessary due unprotected population US hive mind start screeching panic vaccines effective, completely ignoring context.

If want replies limited context country would great. US screeching countries haven’t even gotten vaccine, comments USA posts countries. I've masked beginning since vaccination.

No one else around diligent. demographic's risk par flu hospitalization. already ADHD, throw sleeping problems brain fog, I'd f'ing hosed.

I clarify discussions public policy different personal risk assessments, speaking toward former statements. generally make policy outliers, living scenario increases personal risk entirely reasonable, often advisable, responding differently. 

I'm fairly opinionated policy discussion, go bat anyone feels personally need cautious. case, love broke stats driving risk. Interesting data! (or stay away) still lot research needs done make claim.

He apparently came back sick worked sick five days.

She, co-worker work closely with, got sicker finish shift working together. 

It came light positive test. Disappointed first co-worker. worry, new variant next month vaxxed plebs need booster  think unfortunately people can't get yet... people waiting full approval happens required numbers spike again. kids likely approved august september we'll likely reach number need that. inactivated vaccines worst ones have, still incredible - capable ending pandemic, town Brazil proved. never choose mRNA though. looked numbers. numbers shooting straight graph. Damn. wonder SEA going trend way. Completely different virus, H1N1 still kicking around decade since pandemic likely infected 1B people. vaccines developed still effective. Chill. never was.

Everyone needs vaccine. gave elderly go first don’t want dying disease developed vaccine for.

Younger people dying readily elderly Covid. Thanks. Best wishes speedy recovery. find out, do, I'll reply here.

I really want know well. Though, want anything new. Missouri already missed vacation spending year low vaccination rates.

FUN FACT: every unvaccinated death, likelihood somebody taking dump floor US Capitol smearing wall goes down. Beats me. number still large. Needs zeroes decimal point 1.  would imagine think worth risk, everyone vaccinated risk pretty low now, (or lot of) people changes things bit. policy decision masks required vaccinated people takes lot things account, including low risk, fact people litterally killed mask disputes, damage political careers, encouraging vaccination, etc considered together make logical decision. scientist looking statistics taking steps minimize risk seems logical though. titles always like lol issue doctors dying viral load exposed to? titles always like lol Focusing people afraid represents extreme version people cautious end spectrum. People back argument act like pandemic represent extreme end people want move forward.

Why severe say one extreme afraid say dishonest? translate, means highly embarrassing politicians civil servants. 

But mainly politicians. 

My guess: Australian taxpayers pay hundreds millions dollars vaccine doses delivered never used Australia anywhere else.

That, we'll pay enormous contract break fees. Hope that’s right didn’t feel anything except swollen lymph node near collarbone doesn’t hurt all. noticed week first shot.

Going loo swimming difficult wearing mask painful, really don’t get drama it. wonder long one LA business intends mask mandate on? hope permanent, although considering LA's vaccination rates still need potential danger Delta, blame anybody there. Look bright side, vaccine worked probably antibodies. Also vaccine caused this, real virus must hell. won't. faux announcements nothing fever dreams Bali governor, who's talking opening back since May 2020. guess early next year earliest. 10 times many people qualified administer vaccines, considerably money so. Fully vaxxed counts. Especially you’re dealing variants like Gamma Delta. No, still contend much probable not. Virtually guaranteed, caveat time biggest every species able adapt changing circumstances enough survive. true viruses. case SARS-CoV-2...

Certain lineages SARS-CoV-2 might able adapt changing circumstances enough survive, others many changes protein undergo longer fits onto receptors.

While there's limit rate mutation; theoretically, limit many changes gene go through, therefore extension many configurations spike protein spike protein mutates enough fully evade vaccine-induced immunity, may able bind receptors cells anymore...

We know breakthrough infections occur, certainly possible certain configurations capable evading vaccine still bind receptors cells. perfect process obviously, vaccine act incredibly strong selective force makes perfect sense virus improve ability infect fully vaccinated individuals going forward. biggest factor again, time.

The virus certainly never going go away, hope vaccine, build enough immunity short enough time frame ""co-exist"" way kill us. Much sense measles lethal disease humans.  Let define stupid use it:
Somebody know better, yet acts stupid way anyways.

Sure, people choice others carefully using freedom, ones driving pandemic, ones act stupid go religious gatherings organize big family parties refuse wear masks public refuse get vaccinated (or mostly those). like Russia, aha. Vaccines effective, 100%. Masks effective, 100%.

Similar thing happened family. sick tested negative - us, ended bronchitis. far SG goes, quarantines incoming travelers nearly airtight. 14 days &amp; 5 PCRs + self tests currently.  got lucky. least it’s intended, u catch covid even u vaccinated wont end respiratory tubes.

Even got mrna like Pfizer Moderna, would still catch everyone around absolute moron. Staten Island better vaccinations Brooklyn Bronx. enough tell. Actually yes, similar flu... good all. flu already bad enough going twice death? New York's numbers significantly hurt fact Bronx Brooklyn dogshit terms vaccination compared parts state. fully vaccinated really think need go extreme. People two jabs Pfizer Moderna, two effective vaccines right now, also catch covid, although, like said, symptoms mild. Give man prize! I’m Los Angeles. That’s December January here, least couple times week I’d hear friend, relative, acquaintance passed. depressing, even though vaccine doctors vaccinated seemed like never going end.
Keep double masking hang there, there’s light end tunnel. Even antivaxers, LA half population vaccinated numbers way down. They’ve gone last couple weeks due delta variant it’s better. fully vaccinated really think need pick groceries curbside. second yesterday feel pretty crap - aches, chills, nausea, fatigue. But, it’s even bad cold really. suffering (let alone dying from) Covid would 100x worse. crappy feeling worth dying! yet haven’t, thanks ineffectual leadership last year. sure way.

Both descriptions representing extremes. One group described either afraid refusing return normalcy. described callous dishonest. literally say back argument position.

You perceived description cautious people *more* critical took personally. look felt compelled litigate legitimacy cautious behavior. Talk jumping conclusions.

Both negative reflect way discussion sub tends extreme excludes entire continuum reasonable positions along spectrum.

I’m actually cautious side, myself. Masks lower odds getting covid. prevent completely. Distancing another factor. Mask not, risk goes proximity time spent around covid positive person, well.

People spent entire pandemic explaining that. ""masks work"" line become pure ignorance denial point. help. 100% effective variable comes catching covid.  Really hoping get this.

Hang best luck. 
If everyone tried hard take available preventative measures, world would much better off. 

You deserve happy outcome efforts.  Bet you’re socially popular 1/3 COVID survivors long-haulers syndrome. 

It's interesting tell ""just look yourself"" say ""I trying understand find information."" 

Research reputable sites like CDC. Get vaxxed. Even feel all, still protected, according trials. beat covid tho always knew masks *way* effective person carrying covid wears it.

If indoors infected person several hours, wearing mask, effective. Hence need social distancing + masks least.  Additionally, mean, people’s brains broken COVID news think single person dies COVID, lock forever. UK finally smart shouldn’t delayed reopening. Pandemics don’t last forever, UK around 60% population vaccinated, plus portion prior immunity, plus kids get vaccinated September, it’d difficult still COVID spread level immunity, does, it’s clearly real damage anymore.

COVID still dominant, regular flu non-existent till hit global herd immunity.  pretty bad pain couple days made think ""damn covid woulda hurt lot. good thing got vaxxed now"" Especially summer. It’s gotta beautiful now. bad I’m 7 hours away. need get group together go.   Ah shit remembered meme xD

Also remembered crazy shit   course infallible. know I've trying answer questions, right? Everything I've said points made NSW Government Health Officers, try clarify believe case fleeting asking people change understanding COVID transmitted, something probably single studied topic science last year

I'm asking anyone believe anything? I'm trying clarify Australia's contact tracing noticed lot misunderstanding around subreddit. 

This specifically Delta variant, identified months ago. already lot discussion changes Covid transmission due variants, that's new. Also, stage, countries analysing individual case transmission closely Australia (particularly newer variants), countries community transmission high create clear enough picture. Additionally, one example evidence showing virus transmitted fleeting contact. mean typical. transmitted glance"" 

I mean, sounds it, still close interaction. facing crossed by, closely, wearing masks. main concern brief interaction was. 100% reliable

I agree. Contact tracing 100% reliable. current understanding Covid transmits also yet 100% reliable either. 

Anyway, really looking debate. I'm expert way. I'm Australian follows Covid news regularly bored enough try clarify information regarding Australia's Covid response. bad reaction. supposed feel little least. means worked stimulated immune system. went big family gathering Michigan last weekend.
All adults, kids 12 vaccinated, single person (including kids 12) wearing masks except family (cloth masks).

Exactly 5 days later, bunch adults, kids 12, kids 12 sick sore throat, cough, fever. Including wife 2 kids.

Gonna get PCR test tmrw :( First world problems 😬  Canada 65% citizens vaccinated least single dose… eh, best example. beat fully vaccinated numbers though, that’s good.  I’ve debate before, plenty spare politicians waiting. Little training required.

Doctors nurses hand takes years replace. 

I know I’d prioritise limited resources. possible yet eligible vaccine time got infected? know places US open access till 19 April, may possible already caught COVID-19 time right becoming eligible. imagine deaths June people wanted get vaccine make general eligibility date &amp; qualify earlier non-general tiers forced wait. vent month dying 9 June implies hospital 8 May latest, could've much longer depending disease progression. course caught COVID long ago March/early April, would mean Delta already area long ago. Delta even screened US early spring months? Hopefully US amping outreach. city home visits now. option US yet people trouble getting around? Honestly I'm sure folks UK thinking, one highest vaccination rates world. know anyone would reopening. wouldn’t surprised did. tell? That's predictable means. outcome could easily foreseen. Idk Indonesians Healthcare system works generally nurses respiratory therapists aids spend way time patients doctors imagine numbers quite high. edited title rule essential people often read headlines. amount people would editorialize like OP surprisingly high.  still 60% efficacy btw. Israeli data weird.

Ignore Instagram, delta raging wanna Bali right now.  Yeah honestly prime minister essential service priority imo  identical means. Well, least based quoted... American friend baby soon. wife UK. mother go Barbados 14 days order birth even though fully vaxxed Pfizer. Crazy! Yeah think biggest beef Florida patting back virus five day incubation period sheer amount people taking trips average seven days means they’re exporting crap ton Covid cases along.

I know one particular family gone back-and-forth Florida two separate occasions brought covid back (first grandfather grandmother). rest entire family month later. cases contracted mostly incubated Florida yet show got back Pennsylvania. souvenir cases nothing Florida’s count yet add state high turn know instances like tip iceberg.

Half year, one year, 2 years? everyone around gets 2 doses every 6 months, maybe 2 doses booster every 6 months? evaluate situation yearly? risk death high vaccinated people lot people vaccinated. unvaccinated way choice. Vaccinated people still get infected still contagious. Masks minor inconvenience seems like silly thing get upset about. Swollen lymph node good sign. Means immune system made ton cloned immune cells recognize vaccine antigen. Though Pakistan included directly, safe say Pakistan many deaths cases reported government: http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths  heard microchip shortage?   That's really frustrating bit, objectively Bad Thing society/public health lots people catching virus (because possibility variants, overwhelming health services, etc). actually forcing reasonable section population work extra hard virus, antivaxx idiots pulling weight. Indonesian here. definitely worst us since pandemic started.

It's amalgamation many crisscrossing factors. people tired local government's slow inconsistent policy combatting virus since beginning. Half-hearted travel restrictions, half-hearted testing tracking, on. 

Like India, many people informal workers depend daily wage provide food table, strict total lockdown impossible implement unless government guarantee provide daily needs people. Even provided, there's also chance goverment aid reach intended recipient corrupt officials everywhere. 

Meanwhile, business owners complaining they'll go bankrupt another strict lockdown implemented (which true, still), goverment need make sort compromise please them. 

There's also lack trust health system (because again, corruption everywhere), particularly less educated population. people would rather stay home go hospital due fear ""they'll make covid case eventhough actually something else"". there's lack internet literacy (or general literacy) causes people easily fall ""simple tricks protect covid"" ""covid fake, government's way scam us"". list pretty much endless. 

Sorry long rant. gets pretty overwhelming days. hope get this. Rupert? One problems enough pictures videos intensive care units full people congestions hospitals morgues.

There still people doubting last year problem virus. Seriously. concerning. 

I hope clarity numbers soon. might skewed exposure risks, i.e vaccinated people feeling safe taking risks.

I like visiting arch going though. quite fascinating especially elevators worked. couldn’t pay ride cause claustrophobia. get second AZ jab next week. I've heard rumours second one feel bad. Happens others.

absolutely zero sympathy. locked up. even actually small risk taking vaccine still take risk far outweighs it, bonus, vaccinate virus entire population mutate come back stronger **as already done 4 times 18 months** pandemic shown action required people selfish stuck ways. 

We live society public health also responsibility. 

For simple: vaccinate catch covid, health care costs pocket. country France covered, get things moving. 

It hard make jabs mandatory yes, already number illnesses, least healthcare staff.

We (here) know this. respected scientists know this. stubborn health officials deep denial unknown reasons. Desperate fearful people. need vaccinate expect new strain. Interesting see difference even western nations. However, Germany's -1 daily increase seems unlikely.

It interesting see final data analyses see big differences. UK - sharp end - getting AZ what're going do? see perspective 

Australia every rich country ""should"" giving first vectored dose second mRNA dose. rich countries want pay bit (like $10/person, trivial amount wealthy countries) change vectored/inactivated vaccine doses end pandemic own. mutates slowly, small enough number cases, pretty sure source was. hope private businesses jobs require vaccination make painful/expensive vaccinated.

Ie: certain movie theatre show times allowed unvaccinated people, cruise line tacks extra cost + limited activities unvaccinated people. logical one state problem. rest still motivated stomp vaccination rate pathetically low. places like UK? low vaccination areas go extra mile get f'ing vaccinated already. concerned spike protein? one fully vaccinated household side effects. Pfizer.  stories ""oh got vaccinated nearly died"" helpful. Yeah, lower rate. literal barrier that’s blocking spewing everywhere.

Some barrier better barrier. know someone want vaccine causes sore arm.

The media really field day nothing articles Delta variant. 

Vaccines, even single doses far effective initially reported 30% efficacy. breakthrough cases mild best massive margin, often asymptomatic.

I need three kids get vaccinated now. They’re 10yrs old. :( Mexico terrible, travel there. consulting contract company Mexico City several times last 5 months (since vaccinated). need negative Covid test get back US. Canada’s border closed. 3 Canadian business partners it’s real problem. ignoring long COVID. mean us vaccinated America start worried Delta variant starts dominant strain here? vaccine better vaccine. Total clickbait headline. Article reasonable. Delta could increase cases unvaccinated. NC SC vaccination rates low. variants come non US sources Infection number opposite hard data. absurd.

The true hard data excess mortality. Death related COVID deaths viewed hard data. Infection number known completely useless stat depends much testing. GB testing much per capita Russia. 

Now, according official statistics COVID related deaths per capita lower Russia GB. think many people believe true, possible. come infection number, means nothing. one cares word games. care hospitalizations jumping 50% weeks, delta cases among vaccinated - know, real world stuff word games. Full vaccination 50%, already know partial vaccination effective Delta.

They could waited another month two vaccination complete, due political reasons chosen gamble. Amazon always delivers. many infections deaths attributed lot people using masks, poor quality masks give good seal around face let wearer breath aerosolised virus in. Literally fire everyone WHO, they've useless everything entire pandemic. know, also high well. *stares U.K. evidence shows vaccinated people spreading covid? genuinely curious I’m seeing lot posts Twitter Reddit saying they’re glad didn’t get vaccinated rushed. 

I trust see social media. FYI, article linked referring different city, different outbreak, different variant (Talking Kappa, OP article Delta)

[This applicable also agrees you- Delta seem infectious, kind transmission always possible, even original virus liked whole thing better set rules. I've gone places without mask staff wearing one feel like asshole places one wearing one. I'm fully vaccinated know. still spread it, children vaccinated yet. we’ve probably heard shingles long covid paralysis polio deformation smallpox. many example diseases long term effects. 

Vaccines well established short term effects. examples long term effects vaccines? autism lie comes mind. I’ve heard conspiracy theories countries vaccines way western countries sterilize developing countries. also true.

Are actual documented long term (more 6 months) side effects vaccine? coming somewhere real? way dismiss vaccine. vaccine protection ""projected"", ""realized"", infection number hard data. Calling number like ""troll"" seems hallmarks sect population objectivity problems. mutating virus, would select according ability overcome vaccines come back stronger. And, say months new variant show making exercise pointless?

A new variant spreads easily basically guaranteed. since delta variant becoming dominant worldwide, new variant would closer delta alpha. Therefore one would assume delta-based vaccine would still effective original Finally, still many around word desperate need vaccines. would vaccinate first, got doses got any?

That would probably decided way current ones distributed - negotiation money talks richer countries probably end better off, poorer countries get eventually. There's change really, there's already significant variation allocation effectiveness current vaccines anyone else post vaccine anxiety?

It took get first shot live bunch skeptics keep saying stuff like “you don’t know long term effects vaccine, rushed” eventually got first shot asking lot online looking articles.

I got first shot couple weeks ago get second 9th. I’m concerns again. going bad effect vaccine later road.

This time, it’s already late. One committed getting first shot, might well get second. whatever reason, I’m seeing lot posts Twitter Reddit saying they’re glad didn’t get vaccinated rushed. (Never seeing first shot. Go figure)

Now there’s delta variant Thats infecting even vaccinated people, I’m worried getting it, I’m worried yet getting long term effects vaccine. anxiety doubled. Yeah, native here, efficacy sinovac vaccine sucks ass. claim 50% already astoundingly low, reality probably even much lower. I'm waiting second dose AZ vaccine, immunocompromised person pair stupid parents, I'm really scared half vaccinated. I’m trial participant this. 

It sucks. What’s more, US going take sweet time since hasn’t “needed” it, countries haven’t approved yet either I’m stuck US rest friends family (fully vaccinated Pfizer &amp; Moderna) freely go countries.  Yes, kuffar = non believer vaccinated, would need wear mask? guess expected, covid19 / endemic. New mutations emerge vaccine efficiency usually declines time. protected 4 weeks receiving second dose 6 months later.

I think need worry long protection hospitalization serious illness remains high. protection declines further, maybe vulnerable people offered booster shot keep protection high. know someone thinks chlorine dioxide magic cure anyway husband ventilator Yes, flu saturate ICUs every year. happens problem everyone, people end hospital. Went kids party March trampoline place Pasco I'm exaggerating say one maybe 3 people least 200 mask on. vaccines even eligible large groups population. Multiple people said ""You know need that.

Time tell. incontrovertibly bad news. read article. variants breaking thru vaccine ridiculously high rate hospitalizations 50% month. substantial drop based findings. doesn’t help still don’t know defining “mild” case. think real number probably somewhere bit less significantly so, currently 85% adults 1st dosed, probably end close 90%. vaccines?

Is infecting young population?

Is produces milder infections?

We know (yet) although it'd welcome development, cannot rely that. headline clearly never checked epidemiologist. Vaccine *efficacy* established context randomized clinical trial. article talking *effectiveness*, would get surveying general population. pointed out, misleading number high percentage vaccination. easy way show : 100% cases vaccinated people population fully vaccinated true, even thought current strain strong enough cause major damage vaccinated, get sick risk add risk creating new strain number infected increases.

We take lightly, mistake Modi government delaying inform world Delta strain months, even thought well aware danger. 

Lets hope UK make mistake create next strain. I'm UK second dose August unfortunately. wondering well protected first reduces symptoms grandpa's brother, 60 something vaccinated doctor working middle pandemic died last week. many parents' friends doctors also died left right. 

They ramping vaccination good enough guess, maybe late. last months eid many holidays people forgot covid still exist Yolo way travel despite restrictions (a lame one tbh). friends working certain govt body went Bali last month ""work Bali"" initiative office.

Medical facility collapsing people dying waiting room sent away. I'm lucky enough able work home stay home yeah, beginning what's gonna worst month ever probably. good question. mRNA vaccines tweaked produced quite quickly, mini safety trial hit market. However, know long takes vaccinate large swats population happens, Delta fast. Without restrictions might infect large fraction vaccines reach arms. 

And, say months new variant show making exercise pointless? 

Finally, still many around word desperate need vaccines. would vaccinate first, got doses got any? also know Chinese Government honest reports cases deaths COVID? though? UK’s hospitalisation death rates want chat.

Unless fact UK used lot AZ key difference, showing AZ better? That’d funny. It’s entirely fine. Calm down. vaccines still turn cold high rate, there’s zilch say bad thing, quite opposite. vaccinated people get sick? is, perhaps, dumbest statement I’ve read topic. 

That’s like suggesting people die MRSA taking antibiotics treat people die hypertension taking diuretics. silly troll.

In Russia 17% receieved partial vaccination. GB 66%. about. Actually correct, can't eradicate high transmissible virus, made lockdowns ok,but emerge lockdown virus lol. even problems delta so, really far away world keeping people economic hardship good? looks like he's working much. Nothing vaccine man never knew shut up.

You find disagreeing there. times (is) worst enemy. one? course. thing is, sorts stories one thing discourages people margin. point, we're fighting additional percent vaccination, might case home runs left, nothing add 10% vaccination rates (as aside, think pushing vaccination primary care offices least double, home run). likely work small margins increase vaccination. amount money, Australia could bought Pfizer vaccines highest tier price, vaccinate entire population multiple times. Australia really screwed vaccine procurement. 61.5% one dose 37.4% fully  stupid embarrassing question coming president US

He legitimate question treatment worked on, way phrased it, however, indeed stupid embarrassing. interest defending Trump's intelligence moral character, see false narrative call award biggest moronic president ever.

The jury still one. Depends much Bush Jr.'s idiocy acting, much genuine. I’m taipei I’ll never go Jakarta. Good bot. Virologist Paul Bienasz warning outset pandemic. Partial vaccination delaying vaccines accelerate evolutionary pressure overcome circumstances uncontrolled Delta sooo last month, check lambda variant looking good Delta variant spiking right now. 

Biden Fauci probably urge Americans travel UK right now. Sinovac lower efficacy symptomatic covid-19 (51% vs 64%). I'm sure whether AZ better death prevention delta news posted days ago. Seychelles, 57% vaccinated use Sinopharm, 43% AZ. Yet 1 death received Sinopharm 5 death received AZ. article mention ""AZ mainly reserved people 60 Seychelles."" Since info deceased age provided article, probably impossible conclusion. make wonder. 

I know Sinopharm different Sinovac. since first commentator started shit Chinese ones. I'm Chinese vaccine vs AZ comparison guess. Also, like 68 covid death Seychelles July 1st think, vast majority (62 68) still unvaccinated. Articles like seem like click bait me. story several news outlets. really sad died many others also died Covid. I’m sure one particular death making major headlines. Seems like journalists really trying get clicks based fact scared take vaccine. normally care anecdotal evidence, vaccine skeptics can't convinced statistics, maybe persuaded stories like one. Likely vaccines extremely effective, aren’t foolproof. vaxxed person still get Covid, there’s much higher chance happening you’re around predominantly unvaccinated people.  I’m Missouri. 100% mask wearing, 30% vaccination rate. point, fuck ‘em, got coming. extremely rare cases, vaccines (not mRNA) cause Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS last beyond six months kills percentage sufferers.

However, know much likely cause GBS? COVID-19. Can’t wait, high vaccination rate it’s time finally got back normal. end day probably testing everyone even asymptomatic people... get sick covid came spread asymptomatic really count towards efficacy... Cause matter 100% people fully vaccinated get virus potent virus spread it.  understand % work? chances anything serious vaccine happening vs real chance death covid clear anyone understands simple arithmetic.

it's even league. yeah, wear seat belt might get skin rash burning sensation saves life. personally dont know Anti Vaxxers UK. Luckily seems small minorities. Think Data undeniable worrying many US Anti-vax data obvious. means...covid even vaccination causing amount damage vessels brain. can't solved unless entire world gets shit together, that's lot easier said done. theres lambda variant. Keep buying fear pharma corps keep getting tax dollars. many % population vaccinated? certain places... yes. go south come here. Question someone actually knows shit:

We know Pfizer JnJ defining efficacy differently beginning numbers COMPARABLE. 'decline' efficacy Israel really decline? seems JnJ might've rigorous standard efficacy beginning Pfizer measured way, efficacy actually lot closer JnJ... 

Is appropriate way thinking this? article says 54 million doses delivered administered... could fully vaccinate several small countries. government cases pandemic power show good general public. 

maybe blur faces like google maps, hey people need see bunch old people, people need understand 1000 deaths day looks like.  *pats back*    really. goalposts moveable? not, stop assuming everybody else's too.  now? I’m going far away airport, know hotspots around there? dgaf, majority population country double vax'd That’s funny! vaccines ending pandemic, saving lives, allowing people go back normal… hell would that? hear Covid side effects really kill you. think government rolled vaccine allowed us get back normal, told us vaccines effective variant- media dropping hints wrong government regain control us?  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* actually sounds kind nice. Covid mutate quickly flu, develops multiple strains year far fewer cases. think we'll seeing multiple variants covid per year get cases control - yet. Dont worry, cdc tell new approved booster lambda variant gets trendy talking about? NZ using vaccines, Australia. countries always planned re-open borders everyone vaccinated. NZ begins mass vaccine campaign Pfizer August, Australia's mass rollout starts around October November. Elimination temporary strategy then. 

And worked well NZ. original big lockdown back March-May 2020 since Auckland two short lockdowns 2 weeks. rest time, 99% time, totally covid-free social distancing capacity limits. We've never even mask mandate. ""The committee noted June 30, HSA received 12 reports myocarditis pericarditis occurring people following vaccinations mRNA Covid-19 30 June 2021, administered total 5,485,548 doses COVID-19 vaccines national vaccination programme. total number doses administered 5,485,548, covering 3,376,297 individuals. 2,109,251 individuals received second dose completed full vaccination regimen."" know read article. didn’t say said. woman’s mother stated daughter afraid. know lot people live medical trauma many kinds. wondered maybe people simply scared (not self rigorous, stupid, selfish, etc. ) might need different kinds help. 

I don’t really know what’s possible public message wise. Simply saying “go therapy” won’t get done, agree. maybe kind soft sell message help people take first step speaking therapist (and cost them). 

The “get shot die” message clearly isn’t going reach them.  I'm fully vaccinated one else public wearing mask anymore anyway, I'm done wearing unless business still requiring everyone.  Pretty weird results worth freaking full study comes out. 

UK Scotland found much higher protection (88% symptomatic 80% infection) much higher sample sizes. Canada also came study showing 87% symptomatic infection today. 

The timing change effectiveness also corresponds ending restrictions. Further, evidence controlled previous infection calculating statistic. 

It's also easy see situation school based outbreaks bias number (which happening far). unvaccinated adults Israel younger (I guessing). exposure school based outbreaks, young adults exposed older (more vaccinated) adults would be.

Finally, testing literally everyone could exposed. possible fully vaccines, asymptomatic people would test positive realize. 

All say, lot potential issues statistic need see study making moves based data. Hi, variant delhi originally had?

Was original one modern british appeared autumn? think point almost everyone died COVID-19 reason. Don’t simplistic mom fairly adamant wasn’t getting it. work offered two extra vacation days enough incentive get it. Funny little conviction all. ""Normal"" mean go back jackasses ignoring signs novel infections completeley neglecting set quick response facilities/protocols stop spread.

It means go back living normally.  wont bad.

If would be, would already see UK, Portugal burning not. Lies, damn lies, and...statistics. vaccine case missed point. Still 93% protection hospitalization. American-centric notion 

I'm American, way politicized pandemic (and exported said politicization us, thanks btw) despicable. 

But said, want keep wearing masks so, I'm going necessary they're incredibly annoying. wear masks stop seasonal flu. covid-19's severity gets reduced rank seasonal flu thanks vaccines, see keep wearing masks it.  I've gotta think hugely compounded people trying get work obligations vaccine side effects excuse. Ah, see. think probably soon say one way that, especially delta variant. Though, replicating all, still binding ACE2 receptor means less availability ACE2 convert AT-II AT-1,7 leading [oxidative probably going highly dependent much vaccine reduces viral load. rate think safe assume threat. Assuming best huge problem throughout pandemic IMO, seems like lot lives could saved initially assumed virus airborne rather assumed example. learn every day asymptomatic mean damage done.

TMA strongly linked organ damage. Anyone getting vaccine moron. absolutely reason get vaccinated. think living Florida made cynical. Someone described despairing optimist. I’d like see things like mental health funding, suppose I’ve seen enough politicians charge believe won’t happen. 

Other states, though? might right. hope so. majority ppl take religion seriously , obviously gonna turn irrationally stupid society. Prove wrong otherwise !! agree. Also, pushes narrative actively working time worry trivial things.  microchip you’ll feel little sore implanting arm. Israel reporting 63 percent efficacy pfizer Delta variant. UK data shows high vaccination rate good news. mean Delta variant less serious. I'm hopeful return. I've read anywhere two four weeks symptoms subsided. 

As soon does, I'll let know along rough timeframe. Dutch ""Testing Access"" (*Testen voor Toegang*) system great start.

The idea behind certain venues (such bars, nightclubs, festivals) reopen without distancing rules visitors fully vaccinated, recent negative test recovered previous infection.

Information collected within smartphone app (or paper printout) presents QR code scanned door. system similar EU Digital Covid Certificate used travel, except QR code use within Netherlands shows less personal information. valid scan, scanner app display birthdate (w/o year) initials person. show certificate obtained (vaccine, test recovery).

The first major point failure establishments correctly checking certificates. app shows green signal, supposed check birthdate initials ID ensure person front showing certificate. several places, guards entrance allowed anyone green checkmark enter. meant people could simply copy QR code someone else use enter.

Then first days system going live, many testing sites overloaded deliver results tiime. cases, people simply got negative result generated manually went back ask gotten result yet.

The problem article writing revolves around test center correctly entering results system. Automatic barcode scanning failed, employee manually entered results made error, causing someone receive negative result actually tested positive. error corrected next morning, man gone several bars. Israel vaccinated people, among sick greater fraction vaccinated people. largely explains vaccine effectiveness appears going down.

If Israel 0% population vaccinated, would 0% vaccinated among sick, could declare vaccine 100% effective disease.

Likewise, Israel 100% vaccinations, would appear 100% sick people vaccinated, giving effectiveness vaccine 0%.

Basic rule statistics: compare two percentages unless measuring _the thing_. Good questions. need someone reads Hebrew. Btw infer two shots, since 64%. Ty listing like that. Feeling real good getting Pfizer/Biontech 2nd dose tomorrow got AZ 2 month ago germany. Yes. Every infection opportunity mutation. That's works.  never understood wearing mask occasionally big people.

Because annoying. I'll wear long necessary, more. think normal going vary wildly, Canada 69% total population one dose (35% both, increasing 1.5% day). US slowed around 56% one 48% both. perspective, pretty bad since states big head start countries. 

Honestly seems like countries lower number limited supply, willingness.

It's also crazy much varies state! states phenomenal job others really struggling. I'm sure countries, Canada, provincial rates pretty close. really shows badly vaccine politicised states. think so. wonder happens put fully vaccinated person badly ventilated room lot viruses air say hour. Moderna. Tired. Sore arm. Lived tell. Good them. outside looks like channeled bit national pride effort - Oxford University, Astra Zeneca - British science vs. virus. Also many stock photos guardian uses haircuts illegal (!)

So exaggerated messy hair look.  60% population fully vaccinated, Covid less disruptive healthcare system seasonal flu, what's argument return normal? Long Covid  though read article, vaccine still 98% effective hospitalisations. main goal vaccine, everything else icing cake. Free market, baby. that's libertarianism like see.

Go on, businesses. Germany high quality healthcare lot hospital ICU beds. Healthcare Netherlands perhaps worse quality rationed observant cost savings. Almost? Yeah, mean cake eat it. Obviously. point able eat cake yet still eat.

Anyway, English eh. literally saw one today.

One down, thousands go. UK 45s offered first dose back mid April. 12 weeks ago. managed get booked straight away would already second dose (it 12 weeks, typically 11). booked later would second dose rebooked 8 week interval (as offered 40s recently).

In age cohort England 80%+ single dose 62+% two. get higher percentages use ONS population estimates instead NIMS too, reckon ONS closer true figures. Although he's UK pm affects England. devolved nations keep restrictions least longer. That's surgical masks Germany least using FFP2 / N95 masks public transport shops, dining indoors, regularly mandatory testing school children twice week. sure sufficient. Cases dropping low level 5 cases/week/100000 people, stagnant half new cases delta variant. That's cool. mean, directly addressed comment providing CDC page telling people wear mask prevent getting COVID. 

They also saying quote, guess dismiss reason Studies demonstrate cloth mask materials also reduce wearers’ exposure infectious droplets filtration, including filtration fine droplets particles less 10 microns.

No one denying masks primarily help keeping infected people spreading COVID. one that's going grain refusing reality CDC recommends wearing mask help keep getting sick. Yes wear ffp2. Metal bend nose. widely known vaccine shield? point getting transmitting Covid. wearing mask. Well, virus vaccine induced, eventually lead immunity. virus probably gone, move on. 50% Davidson (Nashville).  Like said earlier. admit you’re okay possibility tens thousands unnecessary deaths people suffering lifelong issues long covid can’t bothered wear mask. 

I think it’s terribly selfish, I’d prefer people honest it. perhaps kind herd immunity created

Top German experts (Christian Drosten, top virologist, Karl Lauterbach, SPD politician, doctor epidemiologist) well health minister Jens Spahn say *no* herd immunity. words, everyone either vaccinated, contract virus point. That's almost change going 0% 80% protection.

The base rates equal, though. would reduce spread much, much convince single unvaccinated person get jab convince vaccinated person mask up.

Vaccinated people problem, here. They've largely taken equation spread disease, they've strongly protected themselves.

Finally, arguing wearing mask--I still do! *mandating* masks without first *mandating* vaccines.

I arguing waste effort try convince vaccinated people mask rather meaningful things--try convince healthcare system mandate vaccines workers, try convince local universities mandate vaccines students/faculty/staff, etc. much bigger effect. long you’re fully vaxed go anywhere safely. People's obsession efficacy numbers misleading many people tbh one ever said masks 100% effective preventing spread COVID

""Not 100% effective 0% effective"" - anti-maskers

""Not 100% safe 0% safe"" - anti-vaxxers ones one dose already extremely low risk anyway. still worries either go isolation. buy full face respirator capability filter viral particles. 

The rest us sick this, low risk almost negligible. 

I followed rules first lockdown. mask rules train shops. 

Now July 19th back normal life. People die that's fucking life!!!  obviously covid first priority Ah ok; ""L.A."" would clearer. That's thought originally confused one brought vaccination rates 

58.8% one dose L.A. vs 38.7% LA lol logic whole pandemic China's fault... third wave service wave never finished? Almost seems like someone trust administer life-saving vaccines. suprising. lucky. point may impossible get people comply lockdown. believe vaccine showed higher efficacy 94% Israel May simply less people infected.  
When surge infections, larger sample people different health conditions work I’m comparing fact live covid much way flu. Thousands people die flu every year society still go happen covid.

Covid mutates far slower flu, extensive evidence vaccinations effective previous flue vaccines covid far dangerous flu. lethality long term damage. 

It’s same. long term vaccination campaign could really crush Anyone 18 book appointment vaccine, long covid affects small portion people yes people die that’s life

Can book first dose. Said dose takes ~ 3 weeks efficacy limited effectiveness second dose, months away. Long covid effects [around 10% hardly “small fraction” callously claim. [children covid regardless severity show biomarkers blood vessel damage] 

Just admit don’t care health others instead think freedom wear mask important. could respect honest even think you’re awfully selfish person.   Man....the one guy lives found thread...what odds. :) nah similar generally gives results, differences, e.g. dosage. Moderna 100 micrograms Pfizer 30 micrograms, average elicit stronger responses leading to, e.g. stronger side effects &amp; better (first dose) efficacy.

I think Moderna might better single dose, second dose tends close gap. sure much first dose difference strains though, confirmed Oh, right, meant 80% vaccine fully vaccinated, that's wrong statistic compare Israel's Pfizer data. 

UK found 70-90% 2 dose Pfizer infection, 85%-95% symptomatic disease. Ngl made smile :) *thrilling* assured many website February talk third wave Canada hysterical nonsense propagated lying media medical officials become addicted famous, exact users (RES tagging makes easy see) making confident pronouncements potential risk posed Delta also fraud exaggeration something. One would think ounce humility would least possible something like that, apparently big ask. Another major factor probably Canada national healthcare system, US still retains primitive fragmented for-profit system, coordinated neither federal state level. give Canada big practical advantages, also helps put federal government driver's seat healthcare, smooths funding differentials across country, makes provincial idiosyncracies much less issue.

Or least I'm thinking that! Netherlands… I’m pretty sure case almost every country around world. communications cluster fuck combined herd’s stupidity. Sad think know answers already Certain measures control spread Covid-19 come high cost: examples include forcing business halt operations, forcing people socialize drastically less.

But compared things like that, cost-benefit ratio mask-wearing ridiculously good. Agreed. important metric think difference vaccinated people unvaccinated people regarding hospitalization rates death rates. definitely think infection big deal young healthy, definitely side, works nursing home, travels lot, parties lot, etc. offered vaccine February, job, 5 months could done research, asked doctor, etc. 

That's gives anti-vax vibes valid concern, yes, based ONE article headline read months ago vaccine even give US apparently, completely sidelined revisited idea. Well they're immunocompromised, sort viral infection could kill them, saying lock end viral infections? seems crystal orb grants foresight future better epidemiological modelling SAGE. Understandable excellent evening Alternate  far, AZ J&amp;J. Fair enough. 30’s haven’t second dose yet - that’s big chunk working population. know joke. lot former needle users actually legit fear needles get vaccine. Congrats?  No, would large exit wave. Move along now.  Oh. ""We're allowed too"" thank sir, may please another? immunocompromised deserve normal life too? Facts unpopular suppose. ... hope Testen voor Toegang. confirmed somewhere? Agreed. think ‘loss aversion’ fallacy might help motivate people get vaxxed that. 

Tell Americans ~3 weeks get vaxxed will, time wait line vax inventory sent people countries desperate protection. took time comment categorically wrong, idea would put uneccesary strain NHS worst time possible. 

Large not, exit wave winter worst outcome. steal insult dumb dumb ever really? It’s going matter. virus smolder change long it’s kicked media front pages. want something afraid you’ll always find I’m comparing fact live covid much way flu. Thousands people die flu every year society still go happen covid. 

Anyone 18 book appointment vaccine, long covid affects small portion people yes people die that’s life, way people die virus. learn live go back normal, can’t forever stayed locked people die suffer long term effects. 

The whole point us getting vaccinated allow us get back normal high rate already low deaths.  Ssshhh

Wearing mask uncomfortable! Covid flu. Yea, Turkey example government, started give Biotech 3rd dose people 50 took 2 doses Sinovac healthcare workers vaccinated sinovac. Well, duh. Masks filter anything work. Masks filter (and seal correctly) do. like known since beginning pandemic.  Same. I've become aware disgustingly unhygienic crowded workplace is, stagnant air, since masking get colds allergy attacks. chuckleheads refusing vaccine, unsettling. Excellent news. Hate Tories, can't help little bit thankful they're power right now.

Hello almost 50% vaxxed Knox County! damn im good math Also America, stupidity doesn’t kill medical bills will. can't close everything forever few. worried feel free isolate permanently.

I'm fairly sure full respirator mask offer enough protection. Go buy one them.

Note said “large” exit wave comment? 

You smart. can’t read. care wearing masks lockdowns

Yet took time comment post it. smart. means though, can't (continue to) (possession of) cake eat too, one must choose either cake one's possession eat cake diabetes instead cake.

Out interest one earlier references John Davies 1600's phrase actually ""A man cannot eat cake haue stil."" much closer wrote it.  work supermarket wearing mask 7-8 hours, enough people vaccinated deaths low.

And wear mask work well, it’s really big deal. Deaths low right now, increase. people suffering long covid. many tens thousands young adults life long issues long covid worth wearing mask you? ain’t ever going get rid covid variants pop time time, live much like flu.

Don’t compare covid flu, it’s evenly closely same. terrible see Australia increasing problems covid brilliantly fought covid 2020.

Good luck Aussies. things he’s ever said done, precisely *that* fully business. exactly cup of, well, tea, many decent British MP found worse conditions. masks forever

Not interrupt inner-drama, one saying “forever.”  people wear masks (And course get vaccinated) faster get infection rate steady decline territory.   


Pretending things back normal, disease replicating control, going prolong pandemic, actually make anything normal.  anti-maskers anti-vaxxers dragging out, sucks. We’re sick it. can’t wish away like magic. vaccines masks = fewer outbreaks, fewer variants, sooner time things actually normal. need either avoid MSM entirely, read actual articles critical thinking hat on. Newspaper headlines original clickbait. case highlighting need keep eye rates infection vs vaccination.  Sadly, 50% barrier barely budging. America going worst first worst cracked somehow. God forbid president try soothe us much trauma. allowed here? Top hole, chaps. Bang on. Yeah, Delta real POS. We'd probably done without that. really pissing off. live US, everything here, cat here. pay tax here, pay bills, pay rent, pay bloody health insurance! home anywhere else, I'm fully vaxxed, yet leave country see family allowed back in!  also help pollen-related allergies. I'd agree except think Americans refusing vaccination type people travel internationally.  done vaccinating everyone living canada Lol, global vaccine passports? good luck that. mask wearing nearly silver bullet vaccines are. Source? Define better.   It’s funny mention yen, luckily Japanese tourists aren’t banned entering United States. However, need quarantine upon return Japan even fully vaccinated. Honestly, US open everyone point, there’s ample time vaccinate whoever wants it. Interesting. Never annoyed wearing mask. Welcome literal state US sequencing. 

However, recent sample less 100. Consider though we've many days nearly 100 samples, rolling average low 25% since June 12. 
They include Confidence Interval graph. low sample size says 49-70% today.  I'm attempting give best case scenario. yeah. Mask wearers likely vaccinated already. Wear masks? Enforce vaccine passports? control prior infection portion unvaccinated control preexisting immunity. means experience infection lower rates otherwise would. way efficacy calculated comparing relative infection rates unvaccinated vaccinated groups. unvaccinated infection rate reduced prior immunity vaccine appear less effective even effectiveness remained unchanged. mean, whole point downvoting hidden clutter discussion. mask wearers almost certainly vaccinated. Hopefully now, never actually know! true. Similar BFE midwest. true anti vaxxers fencesitters. True anti vaxxers lost cause. Fencesitters may convinced vaccines get fully approved. 

There’s much it’s optional vaccine. growing confidence product seems like good idea.

I see department health posts trying entice people get shot. really seem ineffective point. think need full approval tip scales.

Then fencesitters vaccinated, we’ll know whether herd immunity possible. Right we’re stage. 

That’s perspective. Note person provides specifics regarding claims, derision. Covid never going away regardless That’s less 10% total population, don’t think that’s making breaking pandemic US lmao Delta 60% now. Unfortunately CDC's data slow update, Delta moving fast. last data CDC reports two weeks 5/23 6/5, misnamed ""Nowcast"" (where 25% estimate comes from) estimates two weeks 6/6 6/19[1].

Outbreak.info much date uses sources data CDC Outbreak.info estimates 6/30, estimate 6/30 64%[2].

[1] vaccine 100% effective. Dr. Fauci simply giving professional advice, mandate. want extra cautious prevent breakthrough infections mask N95 equivalent indoors high-covid/low-vax regions. risk-averse may avoid traveling states. head fall we're transitioning Public health Private health. decide what's best health &amp; safety. I’d like track measurement. Like ok it’s date it’s per/10,000 people thing. hell handle “we’re looking 3 numbers, x z, trajectory”. Technically correct? seem logic it. They're attempting speed peak order avoid later peaks colliding flu season.

There also herd immunity benefits severe wave top protection variants, particularly amongst high transmission single dosed 18-30 year old cohort largely asymptomatic mild symptoms. Equally likely encourage unvaccinated people come forward jabs and/or protected result infection. Low 40's M. Heart rate 100 day getting second shot. Even woken up. over-fed patients eligible group 4. Yes, that's also true. speaking specifically efficacy. Companies quite clear calling vaccine success vs ""failure"" clinical trial, determines vaccines efficacy. clinical trial, someone vaccinated still gets virus considered ""failure"". Even person never shows symptoms mild symptoms. counted example 90% efficacy JnJ vaccine. 90% people never infected detectable amount vaccinated. add people maybe infected, mild symptoms really get sick, 90% efficacy becomes even higher. least, understanding it. could wrong... Hope so, think lot people suddenly find new bad reasons get shot. u say ridiculous things ready receive ridiculous answers return   individual asses risks.... kind like travel ""advisories"". Someone who's 40 &amp; vaxxed get breakthrough covid way quicker without complications someone who's 80. absolute. people can't get vaccine, there's always small chance vaccine needs do. That's says ""almost all"" title. top that, unvaccinated people virus factories new variants vaccine might effective against. Anything 70%. Wow compared month ago, big jump older ever  even older

They Might Giants government govern consent people scientists. Besides Witty qualified scientist appears perfectly happy open again. using cloth mask probably decrease chances infection % points vaccinated. true efficacy need either double mask surgical mask + cloth, use high-filtration N95 equivalent. basically immune high-covid environment fully vaccinated too. keep mind Dr. Fauci talking specific regions South low vax rates &amp; high Delta infections. Vermont California overkill unless immuno-compromised something. area overwhelmingly unvaccinated they're going get vaccinated time soon. I'm going wear mask next months/years waiting 50% state slowly get natural immunity catching covid. people ridiculously pathetic way responding ideas theirs? get vaccine something I'm risk for? Moderna shots kicked ass - happy hear worth it!! 2 week lockdown ending Friday probably extended, could become fight attrition government running low budget funds good will🥺  IQ distribution symmetrical - average equal median. Yes people devolved nations likely want travel completely unrestricted England bring cases back them. much point different policies. say exact sentence literally second day pandemic  That's Florida. Thank comment. Simone biles mental gymnastics article noted this, also noted even among non-""test entry"" tests, increase. Legally mandated Masks part lockdowns. pro vaccine think fence sitters might take approved fully. idea.  Oh, don’t that. would presume remain safe possible haven’t able vaccinated yet. know got downvoted right thing. totally agree you! checking, always locked flu season worn mask outside home? Otherwise also ok tens thousands unnecessary deaths past moved personal goalposts. 46 million cases per variant concern. Current cases: 

State Cases Population

South Carolina 597,261 5,000,000

North Carolina 1,014,359 10,500,000

Cases per week way peak. Even assuming every person states caught COVID there's 1/3 enough people generate average variant. repetition last year's case load would 1/30th enough.

Relative unvaccinated rest world tiny. Emergence Variants Concern rare. 

Now ""enough"" ""high risk"" obviously subjective assessments. confident reasonable person would agree. Like believe politician says .... See there’s problem days people take notice Facebook Twitter users. 
20 years ago accepted odd crazies corner pub back bus. Everyone ignores gets life. 

Now random thoughts everyone sees it’s important even gets news paper. anything. saying, empowered employers reel workers back likely know sure time passes by, information regarding vaccines variants changing rapid pace. Kinda can't blame throw people off. thought returning commute mixing hundreds people plus buying overpriced food drinks literally fills anxiety , thinking time wasted revelation extra transport outgoings  Imma gonna steal that. Good job, Indonesian epidemiologist. Oh fuck ya boi, gonna get second Moderna asap mRNA vaccines 100% efficacy Government.  28 million Americans say get vaccinated.. yeah US ways go anywhere near ending pandemic Well seems way fast due removal restrictions. I'm guessing already rise? Long Covid common either, i've read seems linger people moderate bad cases EVEN rare. Gee free medicine available America citizens stop virus. overreaction?  You’ve shifted conversation immune system socialization. plenty safe ways socialize even lockdowns, especially later ones, Zoom mask wearing became utilized. went outdoor walks friends staying 6 feet apart, parking lot parties everyone sat respective tailgates, distanced picnics, Zoom calls, more. That's variants right? bad viruses makes random mutations result headaches us. think Delta variant strongest one causing problems moment. way. TvT positive tests reported RIVM, RIVM includes TvT positives daily case count. Sadly TvT yet reporting umber tests negative tests yet, can't calculate total test positivity, working getting data streams ready. RIVM needs calculate test positivity based tests done tests came back positive (so GGD, also hospitals, nursing homes, private testing, TvT, etc.) report ECDC.

However, positive tests test positivity also raising GGD test streets, register TvT reports, done GGD test streets. according TvT, advising people positively tested retested GGD's. positive test TvT enough isolate, need confirm GGD's. means number cases definitely rising, perhaps steeply suggested title. That’s rough. wonder child’s doctor would write note saying child tested certain circumstances something? don’t answer hugs hope kiddo make awhile without cold anything &lt;3 study control prior immunity like original vaccine studies studies delta efficacy did. course got different result. US always throwing money it. first year money mostly thrown companies anything pandemic. psychopath? It’s crazy though. 

I mean. bats? Probably. It’s first time animal passed infection human blow up. 

Could lab leak? Sure. Shit like happens too. It’s crazy theory. 

When people start talking multinational conspiracy turn us cyborgs, yeah you’ve entered funny farm. pandemic global problem. single country ""end"" within borders. addressed globally problem us. Stalled 50%. Children make higher they’re already low risk. must live Iqaluit Kitchener. vaccinations. country almost 50% acting behavioral scientist precisely go-to expert behavior change light restrictions lifting. he's behavioral scientist Twitter, he's member indie SAGE (from seen) seem agree this.

I'm opposed lifting restrictions general, lifting mask mandates public transport etc. pretty perplexing, seems like minor restriction big upside - CEV people thrown bus could lift mask mandates entertainment/non-essential contexts. Recall UK middle Delta variant wave, unclear exactly peak land. Though low amount deaths certainly cause optimism, think indie SAGE terribly unreasonable here. buy either. figure that? “better”? Pfizer shown better 2 AZ, interval works reduced 6 weeks.

Germany reduced interval four weeks apparently works almost well six, keen get people fully vaccinated soon possible Delta. Won’t go away, get better point one still wearing mask  stricter controls good approach, hopefully keep lid things. wish we'd taken stricter measures earlier pandemic Canada even though hopefully lid things now. liberal bastion Los Angeles 40% unvaccinated... pharmacies begging people get vaccinated everyone already sure voted. reasons give wear mask never going away though. will
Need give point n  OK, enlighten I'm wrong since live US, surely company cannot deny doctor-issued medical leave, got illegal move, right? somewhere could report thing (anonymously course)? Sucks they’re slow ... got mine March I’m 20s single person thread said they’re always going wear mask  Agreed, mixed bag data here. eventually give up. Depends look it. Let’s say somehow determined 10 days away pandemic ending. tomorrow, new variant strain uncovered started spreading, putting us 6 months away pandemic ending. said tomorrow “closer ever”, wouldn’t true. day 10 days away. 

I know messing meaning words, technically facts change new information come change timeline better worse.  Australia afford buy damn vaccines, PPP per capita 51k, compared usa's 66k, UK's 49k.

Delta running rampant vaccine 100% foolproof. still catch it, become vector, hospitals stretched capacity already. lie cheat system holiday context irresponsible country visit. better go house mourning  go house feasting,  death destiny everyone;  living take heart.

Ecclesiastes good place end July roughly 80% eligible population fully vaccinated. need wait till fall. people left vaccinated 12s approved sure hell better stockpiling doses get instantly approved. got J&amp;J Saturday, picked I'm home country, need travel month time second jab. 

I got sick dog overnight since dodgy Chinese takeaway perhaps chicken me, symptoms pretty close food poisoning. problem people want get vaccinated. fuck downvotes? Let People make decissions lol. doesnt feel safe low vaxxed zone wants keep masking totally fine. fears, even isnt Covid, still wont want People dissmising it. wasn’t point making. It’s freaking patchy. We’re 50% within city limits still rising steadily, whole county like 30% Burg. Coastal counties guess aren’t gonna participate, they’re vaccinated like it’s California Northwest corner state. Trump Spangled Big Truck types holding us back usual. thinks hes cool Why? ever get COVID, already told wife do. Feed Vitamin D, Vitamin C Ivermectin. I'm going hospital, thank you. That's kill people ventilators. It’s really not. mean? bode well that's case. rich nations paid dues cases, deaths lockdowns finishing vaccination effort next month so. Australia solid vaccine uptake going dealing shit till late 2022. need give people incentive get vaccinated, tell people get vaccine tel still wear masks you’re going get far fewer willing Actually is. logic first poster wear mask prevent ever giving someone. never stop.  right Moderna shipments lot shakier overall Pfizer ones. would Australia list? recipient? need stopping criteria goal posts keep moving. Hospitals fine US open weeks. There’s reason force vaccinated people get masked right now. dunno I'll that, I'm comfortable Ventilator tubes throat pissing plastic bag doesn’t seem dignified me, carry course immediately go country, Netherlands, know things here, see makes sense. not. quite extensive methodology page, data either wrong heavily outdated metrics/calculations used make sense opinion.

1. way calculating vaccine coverage make sense. take total doses used divide number based type dose used. course make sense. far best metrics % total population fully vaccinated 2 weeks. number total pop./adults partially/fully vaccinated without 2 weeks would better metric used. example Netherlands 62% partially 38% fully vaccinated total population 77% partially 47% fully vaccinated adults. could've used, instead went vague total doses divided vaccine type metric resulted 43.2% (by way, calculations government data comes back using metric...). Also, type vaccine given known, divide entire number 2, another flaw metric.
2. lockdown severity seems totally inaccurate, unless takes account lockdown Netherlands 6 months. list would make sense would look current situation, that's case seems totally wrong. Basically rules exist festivals limited 1 day 25k capacity, 1,5 meter required unless corona free proof (e.g. test, vaccination tested positive recently). Everything open set capacity, time reservation limits. mask mandate, public transport. education offices opened advised anymore always work home whenever possible. Also travel restrictions nationally internationally based risk level. scores 68 lockdown severity? Alright... Must outdated Oxford University gone crazy.
3. flight capacity even fair countries domestic air travel. countries like Netherlands local public transport together air travel would lot realistic measure. way, public transportation Netherlands back regular pre pandemic schedule travel limitations/advise kind travel. Air travel strictly international, nothing things going here, strictly countries like keep borders closed risky countries.
4. vaccinated travel routes I'd like see actual data. huge disparity EU countries coming from, generally international travel rules block. example Spain 365 Romania 371 top, Finland Sweden near bottom 142.5 167.5 respectively. Everyone allowed EU fully vaccinated unless considered high risk variant concern. means fully vaccinated people safe, EU, high risk high risk travel EU. EU. Netherlands specifically requires mandatory quarantine coming high risk country without variants concern. High risk advised mandatory, everything else quarantine.
5. COVID status, good hospital data well, perhaps reliable metric, often counted well unless system overloaded limited capacity, shows well much COVID going around. metrics explained well Bloomberg make sense. They're also aware huge inaccuracies comes metrics. fine overall.
6. QOL, 2021 GDP growth seems place. main problem also look much GDP changed due COVID 2021. economy hit extremely hard bounces back extremely. country GDP fell 10% 2020, increase 5% next year, still behind 5%. country B GDP fell 2% 2020 increased 3% 2021, ahead 1%. according list, country would score significantly better realistically much worse. Bloomberg trying argue better because: ""the Ranking aims show best places right now, well they’ve deflected economic blow Covid-19."" saying GDP grow lot year, automatically lot better place right now, matter happened last year pandemic GDP. economies relatively well last year thus rebounce economies worse place collapse punished? example Dutch GDP fell 3.7% last year. latest economic estimates major Dutch banks, Dutch Central Bank CPB estimate Dutch economy fully recover pandemic within year showing growth 2022 growth \~4% 2022 normalises assuming form pandemic measures still need rest 2021. Spain, comparison, rebounces extremely \~6% growth, falling 10.8%. Spanish economy recover end 2022/early 2023. year later Netherlands. Would say Spain would better place relation economy?

Overall fun list tons data beautifully made. looking deeply Netherlands specifically see many flaws say says anything useful. whole, know set metrics right ones make evaluation, that's complex matter me. look individual data check date, accurate make sense. “There still little data available whether delta variant causes deaths. known that, according PHE, 117 92,056 people infected delta variant UK June 21 died. means fatality rate 0.1%, low comparison variants.
However, experts believe low rate deaths largely fact large proportion UK population vaccinated coronavirus mean delta causes less serious cases disease.” excellent news regardless. feel great it. great song lyrics definitely depressing aware fact, yet still worried young kids catching covid flu. reasons that:

(a) get flu shots every year, making less vulnerable kids usually actually die flu (the unvaccinated, especially newborns can't get flu shot age 1) and

(b) flu known illness rarely long term effects. still know whether covid one things like chicken pox give shingles 50 years later.

(c) COVID contagious, they're also likely \*catch\* covid flu without precautions.

People also seem think parents never past taken precautions kids getting flu. do! twins newborns old enough get flu vaccine yet, flu season visitors wear masks plane traveled visit us also sometimes wear mask entered house played babies, really peak flu season. kept play areas clean, everyone wash hands touching babies, wore mask crowded areas. Sure, maybe person flight work trip wearing surgical mask, knew keeping kids safe flu care funny looks got. ""Just two weeks!"" ?? people wanting mix pfizer first (as huge supply moderna right now).  take expert tell obvious answer. neighbor got twice 8 months, likely community exposure (neighborhood pool outbreaks) elementary school outbreak.

I know others didn’t believe real didn’t believe family risk got twice 6 months. believers 2nd case much worse. rings bell can't place it. Help out! (r/tipofmytounge) think depends largely area. current case rates? Higher case rates lead opportunities break infection. busy hospitals? want make sure hospitals handle larger patient load reduction precautions. current r number area impact raised?

There lots criteria, unfortunately without all-knowing crystal ball, hard predict exactly what's going make difference give specific stopping criteria.

Also, please note never called selfish took issue idea finish line. Except it’s “wear mask forever stop”. continue wearing one rest year stop point. again, doesn’t affect Airbags kill people time! fit narrative!  impression many immunosuppressed people cannot get vaccine? everyone able get 3+% immunosuppressed people excluded? 

I'm saying wrong least, think noting people live people vaccinated whatever reason still want protect loved ones exist personal reasons extra careful virus. need FFP2 masks everyone! 
To limite transmission. See brother! 🤟🤟🤟 rise clearly teenagers though, going crazy clubs bars since reopening. see breakdown per age group still bad hand also seems vaccinations working, since age group last vaccinated. Low reporting 4th July. 7 day average like 290. Oh I’m pretty sure whole planet since start. Yes. choice. didn’t say stop. reasons wearing mask never going go away. ? Right Either wear mask forever stop. finish line. hospitalizations lag cases couple weeks. see large increase hospitalizations moving forward Japan 14% fully vaccinated additional 11% partially vaccinated… Yep. Access everywhere everyone... Nothing see US. try blaming minorities! America loves that. that's depressing.

Kinda point, guess. say anyone needs stop wearing one? you.

Im least doubting 500 000 confirmed cases, probably well. im doubting 50 000 plus long hauler children UK 500 000 cases.

Neither covid group control group anywhere near 500 000. 

Im also seeing anyone taking anything lightly, see rigid study outcompeting less rigid one. science. science brought us vaccines. think method wrong, well, thats you. that's like country...so good Wow! That’s great numbers! 

Yea, bit depressing. lot rural areas state followed politics certain elected officials. Fortunately big cities bit educated (where live). 

I looked 37% vaccinated, hey, bad 30%. :/ someone lost family covid-19, assure irregular cycles matter near much loss life. hand right now, recall article saying spring, Britain found coronavirus cases among people returning Pakistan Bangladesh among people returning India.

Given Bangladesh's poverty extreme population density (imagine almost half US population crammed area size Florida), things could quite bad there. doubt official statistics accurate. United Kingdom Act 2 real..and plus vulnerable already vaccinated, think good. uneducated people think antibodies end immune response, news media aware knowledge gap. 

So let's ever talk antibodies cause panic clicks  bet people vaccinated care get covid anyways..    No, not. One preventative public health (nobody change immunity status without viral medical intervention) one collection lifestyle, environmental, genetic results. 

The discussion people consume calories expend complex ongoing. Public support programs de-fat public exist. Also, someone might get little pissed deny granny birthday cake.

The discussion whether vaccines epidemiologically effective settled. exists infrastructure programs deliver vaccines (in particular, one) free charge little inconvenience. 

That's different.

It sounds like energetic subject. encourage support public funding sports, recreation, preventative doctor visits, health education, healthy school lunch funding, measures proven improve childhood obesity later life health. Yes, true vaccine hesitancy worse sure. read comment? door would knocked feet possibly injured severely.  What? 

Texas 50.47% TOTAL population least one dose hit 50% 18+ population FULLY vaccinated June 18th.

This article measuring states 70% 18+ population least ONE dose. Texas likely far behind. California, that's necessarily case  995 fully vaccinated hospital admissions due COVID entire country April 30. 10,000 fully vaccinated people tested positive, without severe disease really mean anything. most, 2,000 people country could answer question affirmative, they're unlikely reading this, that's less 1 million Hello,

Are tests check form exposure COVID? Something might give positive vaccinated recovering patients, guaranteed give negative someone within incubation period? everyone gangsta martha inmune pfizer volunteers helping stewards, also actually administering vaccines, certainly have. colleague mine signed fact, last saw happily jabbing people arm months! computer based training stuff obviously supervision periods etc “released” it’s like grabbing anyone street saying “just don’t stick needle eye”… still ultimately trained professional such. Same, original reply someone chiding someone wanting wear mask despite vaccinated, someone asking new mandate. 10 minutes yes 10 hours desk 10 hours 95F degree production floor it’s difficult.  Gather fellow coworkers sue coworker losses tack good measure pain suffering. liable? Absolutely. Sad types people get effects pocket. Surprisingly one people last year (2020) claims Covid-19 (and is) transmitted air.

However NOBODY everyone else thinks chicken little claims sky falling. amount news articles people get infected elevators less 3 minutes convinced anyone saying true.

In article 3 people elevator one woman wearing mask mouth nose infected child wearing mask infected. also pretty adverse reaction first jab. recommend speaking doctor regarding this, regards antibodies question, also tested mine first jab showed quite high. Jesus... nurses, doctors pharmacists here. Volunteers direct people go vaccine centre. Man quick read title thought Californian variant -which suppossedly reported bypass vaccines' prevention measures- become dominant day, ready shit lmao  
.. theyd still suppressed immune systems, no? could receive vaccine still (essentially) protection? No, federal government covers covid hospitalization treatment charges.  won’t pay cent hospitalized covid. know numbers, got much complete rollout polio smallpox.

Moreso, we're middle/beginning end pandemic free, easy fix people turning down. seeing spikes though starting exponential growth. American, I’m still terrified Covid. Even vaccinated, going hospital ruin life financially. Italy we've vaccinating 4-500k+ people day last 2 months straight, even hitting 600k days (1% population).  
Here region slots so-called ""open days"" couple thousand people register skip normal queue usually gone within 2-3 minutes registrations opening.

I already thought *we* many antivaxxers estimated 15-20%, 60-70% insane. Australians Australia pissed situation, mate. report wrong, 25% new cases vaccinated people, make nearly 60% population.  

It reported 50% cases unvaccinated people, actually 50% ADULTS covid unvaccinated.  wondering 70% adult 70% people able vaccinated 70% population total? President Trump handing identical map months 2016 election.   Well 500 000 infected children report results UK kinda hard control group. Seems like stupid message take lightly. Maybe UK kids whiney, maybe tested more.  Perhaps might trained professionals? know situation nl, article go depth, UK least lot people administering doses fairly lightly trained volunteers...  following science, said many times. know, banning countries higher vaccination rates US, lower cases countries banned. pretty gross. 1) Unrelated discussion 
2) That's still harder taking vaccination shot. 
3) entire fast food/processed food industry fighting keep people fat, idiots fighting keep people unvaccinated. That's tbh. 

They're listening Dear Leader believe real etc. etc. care expect conform level caution. I’m prepared stop living world scrubbed risk. Maine surprise need mandatory 14 day quarantine/testing upon arrival. still, year half thing, figured out.  someone obese medical psychological reasons need help with, even lack knowledge address it, that's one thing. fat lazy sounds like definition privilege. I've fat lazy before.

I mean, instance, someone's choice asshole. make less asshole chose it. variable Russia got less 15% vaccinated. US way 70% adult population. 


Another variable skepticism beginning nationwide vaccination program November, polls consistently shown around 40% less Russians prepared vaccine, scepticism attributed lack trust authorities, cultural preferences foreign medicine Sputnik’s rapid 


Seems Russia got far problem anti-vaxxer US. click article see headline Russia picture Swedes lol Sweden fans cheer stands soccer match Sweden Poland St. Petersburg Stadium. Photo: Igor Russak/dpa. mean people care drunk driving crash/get pulled over. Sucks regrets. ""I Alpha Omega, First Last, Beginning End""

Revelation 22:13 

Couldn't chosen less apocalyptic naming system?  good point. It’s liberal states highest vaccination rates government continues push vaccines. voters = libs politics. Doesn’t make sense all. That's like calling obese people privileged. opportunity workout healthy improve well don't. thats choice. privilege, choice. Lots dumb people hindering this. Influenced certain Dear Leader party. really make mandatory 

How going enforce 

How going restrain antivaxer long enough safely enough give shots (and potential boosters) pull gun/baseball bat/whatever could pose threat doctors 

Personally would hate even try get anywhere near  Yeah well, even 100% people US get vaccinated, there's billions unvaccinated people rest world, doubt likely change anytime soon. vaccine resistant strain develops, deal it.  far reasons vaccination rates, I’m sure lol me? guys got way gamma variant UK did. know mRNA vaccines AZ also less effective vs gamma. Either way, studies, seems like Holy Grail still MRNA type. AZ sinovac similar efficacy would actually go sinovac vaccine since vipit issues. honest, think necessarily bad thing commercial passenger flights stopped. think federal government needs step oversee whole process. Create single proper queue prioritises people based need rather money, arrange flights sort logistics get home. Going hope another instance news trying make things scarier actually sake clicks 

Even though gotta say headlines like vaccine hesitancy thing 100% Dear Leader's party supporters. 

No one else wanted one else stupid. blame Dear Leader this. wouldn’t really care weren’t fact unvaccinated people reason we’re getting variants. Would great everyone could got vaccinated could done this. still really bad screw up. case we're talking two vaccines less thing, nurse/doctor grabs random vial fridge injects someone without even looking big problem.

Come back there’s direct link. Bad news sells Good bot.
I Good bot. I've noticed really hard get clear answers. US city subreddit, see people saying get vaccinated conditions. every single professional medical society seen reccomends vaccination. American Cancer Society says don’t specific information yet effective vaccines might people treated cancer, it’s possible vaccines might effective people weakened immune systems19 compared people healthy immune systems. Despite this, experts still recommend cancer patients get vaccine fragile immune system risk severe COVID-19 disease, getting even protection vaccine better protection.

While one swallow make summer, studies show cancer patients develop antibodies lower levels example Yes healthy people got 3-10x study nothing third dose could get much higher.

It beggars belief see people regularly claiming cant get vaccinated. days back got person talking daughter. asked, mother said daughter remission five years, vaccinated all. really know screwed up, time vaccines tossed garbage, every cancer patient given enough vaccine individual situation. Yes, national tragedies thousands people die normal. Maybe you’ve become numb people who’ve died there. learned new term today. happy lol  think know answer.  France conditioned US does. want compare, vaccination rate US started dropping mid April 38% people vaccinated. France, 50% already vaccinated vaccination rate dropped yet. Woah, texas? Suprise suprise..  official figures. unofficial figures Russia? Variant can't stopped vaccinations. Vaccinations prevent serious cases, infection &amp; spread. Singapore studies shown Variant delta happily spread among fully vaccinated till hits someone unvaccinated serious damage. Cases Australia low would unlikely would exposed two unconnected people Covid, especially occasion early current outbreak. date, 30 active cases NSW (and community time). 

Contact tracing thorough Australia. person potentially exposed Person C different time, would least aware possibility extensive contact tracing process. is, time Person could placed near someone Covid positive time Person B shopping centre. fleeting contact two confirmed following movements via CCTV backed genomic sequencing Listen, Mother Teresa, I’m talking people choice matter. pretty clear talking roughly 40 percent asshole Americans made part culture war like it’s War Christmas. proportion vaccinated population? Yes, money, technology vaccines done this. 49% us willing trust trolling Facebook posts Tucker “make anything ratings” Carlson brilliant scientists spent lifetimes researching understanding disease, it’s treatment prevention. problem eventually sort out... Vaccinated?   Yeah, many others obsess assholes, vast majority rest world actually affected risk - whether COVID lockdowns - silently suffer on, many unable (as per comment above) ""follow rules pandemic"" laid without much thought welfare individuals sustainability. 

You even entertain part thinking. say thinking bad person. I'm sure not; product messaging told focus on. representative find ourselves.

Maybe living amongst poor people, seeing first hand badly screwed this, colors perceptions bit. suspect coworker gave you? still wearing masks? share communal eating area/break room go unmasked? think surface contact? Hence new heights stupidity.

We vaccine, know it’s safe effective, letting covid win denying masks vaccines work, shoot sizable portion country thinks it’s hoax. I’m stealing line describe state USA.  Well yea since 99.8% people recover virus begin with. Read book ""The Immortal Life Henrietta Lacks"" understand black community strong hesitation regards vaccines. wish though city Detroit would try harder utilize prominent local voices try breakthrough hesitant. reaction means vaccine working turbocharge immune system. want make feel little discomfort. course, much. ways Delta variant direct result UK attempting herd immunity student population, gave us Kent spread India. Or…he’s implying places lie vaccination rates probably low mask wearing rates. 90%+ people dying Covid US unvaccinated. hospitals overwhelmed stress lots grief toll communities. think that’s implication. love others don’t want get unvaccinated community members ill (despite themselves) wear mask. Exactly! CDC said could airborne suggested masks beginning, untold lives may saved. something spread rapidly obviously airborne. reason flu deaths overlooked majority deaths essentially people old. young person dies flu local news. news reports healthy people school 20s 30s get severely ill flu quite sad. However, news going report people aged 80+ died illness. Many people view natural cause death. Meanwhile shootings natural shocking happen. prevented flu seen something could prevented unless people socially distance forever. Flu shots help effective many years. Keep mind reported flu deaths much lower estimated number hard actually get reliable flu tests. CDC estimates flu death numbers based excess deaths. actual number confirmed flu deaths much lower hardly anybody knows people dies flu. shades gray kind guy understands world isn’t binary. never seen anything dumb many people reacted pandemic, I’m going apologize calling shitty, idiotic, selfish behavior. rules pandemic pretty simple. Stay away others, listen health authorities, wear mask get shot. absolutely abnoxious nonsense people spouted avoid simple rules beyond rebuke. knew humans could selfish, unbelievable, won’t give inch assholes. aunt died COVID could see first grandchild. flaunted rules. comorbidities 55. painful lesson family. don’t give fuck gray area one. Stop selfish, assholes. Thanks deets. really want know variant results come back. anymore aren't, people still problems ones refuse get vaxxed. us believe vaccines done back normal. whole family vaxxed, new york 70% chilling. Idk anti-vax states hey masks needed work anymore. Loveing it. Get vaxxed people! get 3rd limbs mRna vaccine....and cause would sign 2 extra arms cause would useful work. feel elated knowing live one counties Michigan hit 60% fully vaccinated. pretty much confirmed hunch political landscape area changing. totally agree empathize you. saw coming early January 2020, CDC said evidence airborne transmission dumbfounded. coronaviruses transmitted air? seems common sense virus like causes respiratory symptoms airborne transmitted coughing breathing.  know someone immune system problem US got booster shot (3rd shot). Came make comment. thinking typo… Indonesia United States letters common 😂 nothing it. Israel enough vaccines vaccinate entire population long issue Pfizer shipments. stopped shipments additional doses top that, entire thing resolved new deal Pfizer signed. 

The reason slow vaccinating 12-16 year old health ministry decided avoid recommending it, given Israel already reached herd immunity, increased risk myocarditis among young vaccinated individuals. 

With new delta variant outbreak, health ministry issued recommendation vaccinate 12-16 year olds, numbers increasing faster pace. UK people testing positive Delta variant come Pakistan Bangladesh India. put red list earlier India.  Lmao Honestly, I'm pretty concerned (vaccinated) wife taking three (unvaccinated - young) kids FL week see relatives. I'd worried flying/traveling without anyway, going relatively well-vaccinated NJ potential hotspot making extra nervous. People literally fighting cans sterilised milk there.  things normal?

Also caught it.

Neither vaxed, one asymptomatic one lost taste smell immediately. 22. I’ll vaccination rates actually hit herd immunity, infection rates decrease much further. Look Asian countries; quite common see face masks even pandemic. It’s choice, positively affect anyone else, I’m good that. guess see point view makes right. fact...semantically legally. EUA grants authorization/approval.  FDA different route.

End result exact same. Drug gets used APPROVED USE. live low vax state, although county isn’t horrendous. love friends. love house. family here. avoid going eat it. cut anti vax people life, well, already did. sucks know uneducated people, I’m going uproot entire life it. Yeah, understand that. I'm lucky working home. Hmm, suppose depends going House Reps Senators Ah yes, ""no shit"" news go away bc hesitant microchip believers  Well, it’s choice make, obviously not. I’m concerned, given lack information released Florida, could hot spot. I’m concerned enough information delta variant. I’m concerned son, vaccinated, immunosuppressant medication, want able see him.  but..you might rest life.  Innovative nomenclature aside, really scary Indonesia. I'm neighboring Singapore watching developments closely they've cases vaccinated medical professionals [dying due 

There fundamental political, infrastructure social issues country fueling surge given size population, surprised see take India-like turn. Hope vaccinated quickly possible.  It’s approved WHO, it’s effective others, it’s better vaccine guess. No, think he's saying even though risk low, cost mitigating risk (i.e., wearing mask) trivial. hospitalized co worker vaccinated? I'm gonna use one. country rife it. many parts country, yeah, probably still safe, bunch states 70% adults least one shot. I'm vaccinated state one vaccinated counties state, feels pretty damn safe right now. worn mask almost three weeks, feels amazing, daily case counts remain single digits state-wide.   vaccine 100% effective. get it, there’s higher likelihood, given I’d probably get mild case, perhaps asymptomatic, could pass without knowing. neighbors high risk get it. Because… wearing mask trigger you? refuse accept numbers come populous countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia. 

There's fuckin way Pakistan 1k cases day Brazil (with lower population) 28k, there's way Pakistan 22k deaths Brazil half mil.

In Pakistan stories reusing needles caused tens kids infected HIV. way country health system managed deal Covid well compared India Brazil.

I willing bet numbers misreported least order magnitude. Florida vaccinated. would bother. would wear mask indoors. That’s cute :) trying justify national tragedies “normal”. think I'll keep N95 yet mind. inconvenient. get point we're sure variant escapes latest booster emerge, maybe then. mind inconvenience means grandma dies Covid, gotten me. need carry baggage rest life. eventually vaccinated going survive. best way reach herd immunity. That's informative, still understand identify exactly person someone caught from. say article “If community spread single source introduction … unlikely would able tell different clusters apart.”

So person CCTV footage actually exposed person C earlier day one knows it? sounds like conclude person person B caught COVID people caught people caught person... can't certain many steps either chains contact (other super long). sucks. match numbers saw countries. Usually severe cases almost unvaccinated people. Hope exception, otherwise good, used one best It’s real easy get people side people’s suffering make think it’s way want. It’s become normal, fact, seem almost excited tell us lack compassion *certain* people.  one say he’s implying. absolutely don’t want get COVID unvaccinated communities hotbeds variants going forward. Viruses reproduce millions times single infected host, huge opportunity mutate.

There’s good likelihood variants emerge vaccines effective against. It’s guarantee obviously, don’t want get wearing mask potential hot bed communities makes sense. believer. shut everything 11 too..dude wouldn’t even let order water bans really need reevaluated weekly, applied lifted accordingly, reason enough expertise CDC NIH make weekly evaluation. public health always paramount countries feel it.

Those better metrics. Harder hide. results come soon enough potentially something it. time weeks ago. would good time reimpose restrictions save lives people die month two. happen every state heavily tilted towards communities low vaccination rates. Fact enough Americans natural immunity virus enough vaccinated. schools resume big wave cases especially communities virtual schooling. still haven’t vaccinated children definitely spread schools. low vaccine uptake people 30. People need accept reality move lives. Take precautions doubt states return strict covid rules. virus endemic. many people refuse vaccinations. people vaccinated much better chance infected preventing serious illness. good question get formally answered We’re well aware that. It’s absolutely tragic. course not. call uncertainty statistics. People win lottery too. Rare events always happen large enough population.  stupid article making much nothing. New flash ... upscale restaurant, already tell waiter customer looking dress. Ditto Apple store, Tiffany store, LV store.

Heck, often tell social class looking people wear, car drive.

So big deal waiters wear masks jobs. Add mask uniform wear people tell servers? really news worthy. 7th 8th percentage total population. also think 18 plus number corrected down, like total population was, days ago.

So suck Rhode island balls.

*Glances smarter countries*... Oh, fuck. intramural league competition. Stupidity isn’t exactly mental illness. Maybe it’s that? believe you’ll find already that. Australia good vaccine candidate. shame chance getting positive HIV test result torpedoed it. unfortunate expertise manufacturing vaccines, federal government didn’t active pursue mRNA licensing Pfizer Moderna earlier. Australia could large suppler rest world, US be. moment, potential breeding ground SARS-CoV-2 mutations. problem would cannot get vaccinated resources morons would take bullshit would cascade effect. Definitely appears Delta outcompetes too, unfortunately. clear definitely mean influx covid cases coming getting spread. 

and/or going back tourists came from.

Like March break 2020  fully vaccinated March. Pfzier.

I tested symptoms mild coworker tested positive. binanxnow take home test positive. drive rapid test Walgreens next day tested positive.

My states health department pcr test got sample variant testing. 

Seems like tests work even fully vaxed.

Symptoms mild vaxed. not, anecdotally speaking, seems terrible. N99 FFP3 respirators appear completely effective stopping transmission virus healthcare workers close contact variant known, presumably unknown since evolutionary pathway escape electrostatic filtration. N95 KN95 respirators almost effective, certainly effective available vaccine. agreed helpful.

No vaccine perfect agree ones available good preventing symptoms, especially death, variants known circulating. good, *as good* preventing infection silent spread vaccinated. Viral evolution open ended is, can't assure batch vaccines cover every variant Covid emerge, think epidemiologists promised us that. virus thoroughly escape immunity teams gave us vaccines provide update. read far enough back post history find post think booster conclude issue limited number mutation bands viral RNA limits potential escape modes.

I terribly disappointed discover positive. state heath testing variant Oklahoma last nation knows find out.

What say read responses, vaxed significantly better. Watching July 4th celebrations year feels much different last year. Delta concerns aside, mood seems ""There, lingering"" regards COVID US. Last year somber divisive tone it. difference year makes! None anything whatsoever word “normal” wish easy make understand. Sadly, won’t. Again, condolences country handled poorly many people died. went week unmasked. live Lake Nona I'd say good amount people still wearing masks here. tourists spots mess makes wonder many tourists coming wearing masks vs residents.  Finally, someone came word it. husband Pfizer got knocked asses. mom Moderna reaction. immune system reacts, two shots basically same. Florida always held example restrictions mask mandates low cases / deaths linked. It’s idiots making arguements ignore restrictions across state.   lot people fully vaccinated. 


I wonder say things coming up? happens, I’d glad to. really understand confusion here. thesis one thing normal? Yea think Canada either, news reported AFAIK 600,000 unnecessary deaths isn’t normal, never be. I’m sorry country handled poorly. doctor said general exam “thanks next patient obese 80 year old”. Never saw again, promoted head hospital year later. consequences. None. heard others went see comments normal never 2 weeks between.  Moderna Pfizer wer 21-28 days apart. Yeah unfortunately. united  many us USA fully vaccinated, it’s really issue. Everyone know vaccinated four five months. vaccination status allows travel anywhere want within USA, Mexico much Europe thymus summer. Canada like Australia - totally messed vaccination wise. threat Australia effectively allowed in. still wear mask public. “escape” seen vaccinated sera individuals received Coronavac vaccine China. quote article. reached conclusion looking blood samples healthcare workers given CoronaVac vaccine China.  taken symptom onset. unless tested regularly covid (doubtfull chose vaccinated) time symptoms appear get tested, ivermectin little effect point form everything read. far is. less, mean statistically little. 

I “Check Privilege” = “I worst type person” Smart point. really understand confusion here. thesis one thing normal? less worry non vaxed person. 

Most people regain sense taste smell week there. I'm hoping lose little weight then. lot smoothies spinach since matter right now. :) People: Panic 2020, praying get vaccine
Get effective vaccine, 70% adults get including 90%+ vulnerable.
People: Still panic kids 12 vaccinated know, 600,000 deaths isn’t normal all. It’s tragic. agree extent. However, baby sister (unvaccinated, were) caught whooping cough watched gasped way illness. sick. experience disease strengthened resolve, anything. truly believe nothing would changed died. far rabbit hole convince anything. rife family. also live Texas. Sadly. Whats latest Sinovac? works right? know ppl waiting moderna/ Pfizer, kept updates vaccine. Im curious know more. That's relevant people *feel* science.

None anything whatsoever word “normal” want address fact implied literal forever pandemic N95s better vaccines? wear mask public still kids haven’t vaccinated judge fully vaccinated people attend concerts vaccinated people wear masks. found hot sauce indeed hot protection, better none. Worse case shed antibodies sooner general population. mRNA vaccines, understand work extremely safe since really triggers autoimmune response create antibodies (after body makes protein). different live virus vaccines adenovirus vaccines like J&amp;J. chemo, schedule appropriate time treatment. Still, I've also heard plasma treatment people who, whatever reason, resort that.

But point really there's actual group people ""can't get vaccinated due medical reasons"". might bit knee-jerk pouncing this, grossly exaggerated term people use excuse getting vaccinated (faking it), really say government/society overextending hand ""requiring"" vaccinations. Sadly, still people know. point they’re lost cause me. know 600,000 deaths isn’t normal, corrected appropriate word - “very sad, often involving death I’m fully vaccinated. coworker sounds like dreadful time. Interesting hear differences. hope taste smell come back. Make that:

**Antibody: may test positive vaccination**

Some antibody tests detect antibodies SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (which vaccines induce body make); others look antibodies parts virus covered vaccine. treatment exist, hopefully people treated next time.

Eli Lily’s bamlanivimab reduces risk COVID-19 hospitalizations death 87% severe cases.

Regeneron’s REGN-COV2 cocktail reduces risk COVID-19 hospitalizations death 70% mild moderate cases. Huh, sounds like ""Expect Covid Spikes states without mask mandates"". None claims proven. transmission isn’t crackpot best tool far, masks help well.

Doesn't matter. vaxed, going fine time. vaxed, def trouble. Vaccinated. covid. Didn’t die. Natural immunity thing I’m tired people acting like isn’t.  None anything whatsoever word “normal” best thing I've heard last year.   I’ve addressed fact wrong NZ isn’t lockdown hasn’t national lockdown year. 600,000 deaths, keep conveniently ignoring, simply tragic. Sorry. see they're essential they'd need bumped queue. logic top civil servants, healthcare administrators, CEOs also be. like increased exposure risk like health workers.

And many countries ones prioritised. Teachers, police, hospitality workers wait open age. They’re definitely rising  Leaning towards Pfizer less side effects. TY. want also spread dooming suggesting forever pandemic? Wow thanks sharing. never seen before.

Most states 40%+ vaccination rate, 55% partially vaccinated, since large portion people lean-right still willingly refuse get vaccinated, really don’t think position relevancy.  dare say something true! covid. hear serious side effect young people. you? Salut.  outside hot probably fine ditch mask sun out. places indoors A/C, places I've heard A/C homes (like mine lol, fans going used heat).

Pretty sure done. country, Malaysia, received million doses Pfizer US today. 👍 tested positive covid fully vaxed. answer questions tell promote vaccines. 

The Deets normal questions:

I got fully vaxed March (Pfzier). wearing Mask since beginning pandemic even getting vaccinated. 

I work pretty risky industry though. see thousands people week hospitality industry often intoxicated wearing masks. 

I Oklahoma. quite close noted hotspots delta variant (Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas), isn’t yet known that’s caught. state health department test PCR variants. Pcr came back positive, variant testing takes 10 30 days. can’t say got Delta not, yet. 

My symptoms mild beginning (sore throat). wouldn’t even gotten tested coworker two hadn’t tested positive themselves. 

I lose sense taste smell four days quarantine. worst part ordeal. hope senses come back, however, grateful suffer like coworkers have. One hospitalized one almost was. 

I 38, male, non smoker (of either), bmi 27.3, drink twice week. two days drinking 5 10 drinks day (I’m trying cut down). 

Mods, willing verify sensitive info privately need .  wont. Delta thank god weaker.  think 30% die maybe think covid something else is. ""the link changed lot"" sound catchy. know meant, stop pedantic. Guys stop downvoting duplicate comments. Reddit fucky lately 80% effectiveness *infection tout court* per Scottish data: still 60% efficacy btw. Israeli data weird. live Hawaii. still unbelievable people wearing masks indoor public places. people rushing buy Nestle's Bear Brand milk heard promotes body immunity.  Indeed. 

I'm definitely waiting opportunity get second one. there's new study vaccine's effectiveness delta every day completely different number time mean? Israel giving updates? used primarily Pfizer curious see results. fun Sinovac shows 95-99% effectiveness preventing death, lower effectiveness symptomatic infection mRNA redditors call shit vaccine anyway

Yet criticize AZ exact reasons redditors completely fucking lose mind mention forced hinduism classified monotheistic religion else outlawed... mean Delta variant OG virus. lower efficacy quarter lower. PA pretend hate NJ I’d still rather live like 40 states lol Ah yes, wondering week's effectiveness delta would announced ""There [also] long-established general distrust government's motives, seen prioritize interests elites rather general population."" 
This goes back USA meddling Indonesian affairs due US corporate interests. great book came recently - [The Jakarta Method] Vincent Bevins. Even North Central Calif vacinnation rates high people care community neighbors anymore. 

Assholes still blowing fireworks right even though 1:30am. little dogs lived terror day long. 

Assholes speed residential area, spin donuts intersections toss fast food debris window.

Caring community pretty much dead America. Trump set tone virulent narcissistic egomania America followed along. country gave free antibody tests people vaccinated Sinopharm's vaccine efficacy low people gained 0 immunity shots. choice. vaccines mostly bought rich countries. mean would imagine difference viral load close enough someone covid positive lightly coughs vs spending day around people dying covid, would translate least day two extra time body fight back. consequences lockdown brutal, awful, ruinous everything wonderful life. unless evidence comes 18s anything worry about. 18 months none has, cannoty justify restrictions. 

There thing zero risk low enough cares?  report 23 cases heart inflammation military 2,800,000 doses Pfizer Moderna administered.

Assuming fully vaccinated, that's 23 cases 1,400,000 people.

The chance struck lightning lifetime approximately 0.00000645%.

The chance getting heart inflammation vaccine 0.00000164%.

Get god damn vaccine. Yes! People realize older weaker immune systems.

There data supporting fact covid vaccines could induce weaker responses elderly people: U.K., deaths rising among older adults fully vaccinated"" MoVe children don’t mother. thought taken vaccine. Adderall you. sure people keep bringing talking point. There's billions unvaccinated people across world, mention vast animal populations COVID-19 shown problem moving into. never going stop virus mutating. 

A better way convince holdouts focusing stories like this, deaths entirely preventable, relatively young woman dying leaving family alone. hard weigh potential consequences severe COVID-19 infection versus days discomfort resulting vaccination. saddest part may bad effects. everyone bad reaction. Government mention specific reason told antibody levels first completed shots Sinovac track. Maybe thought antibody levels low 50+ people. point might related vaccine effenciency biontech vs sinovac. 95%   Also mRNA vaccine efficacy Delta variant 88% symptomatic covid. remember Fauci 80. old probably want conservative avoiding viral load body even vaccinated. remember initially higher number effectivity Pfizer. thought maybe 84% more. vaccines 100% effective, closer 88% Delta variant course efficacy dependent things like vaccination rate particular area, number new cases area, viral load, etc. efficacy may lower places spread high vaccination rate low, making likely breakthrough case (still protected severe illness though cases). also older weaker immune system, protection may fall lower end that. 

 
The important thing vaccines protect well hospitalization death. Fauci may trying avoid getting even mild moderate covid. people might care much. also know well vaccines protect long haul maybe concerned that? far, almost reports long Covid (as far tell) based patients self-reporting symptoms. data-gathering method flaws, research ongoing exact link Covid organ damage ongoing negative symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, muscle ache, headache etc etc, self-reporting best now. 

Given caveats, study linked significant shows (for example) 98% young, otherwise healthy participants reporting fatigue, 87% reporting breathlessness, 1 - 4 months Covid infection. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Why?   mean, simple. Indonesia, Covid testing free. free, contact diagnosed covid patient. So, here's issue - leaves poor community completely vulnerable. ones lots contact people, can't afford test fees. since often interact people similar standing, get tested themselves, whole system ""skips"" poor, can't afford tested. yeah, highly doubt numbers well. want vaccine, need extreme social distance Two metres, Three metres, Six metres, means move country, stay City get lot high building lots human.  confused. applying goals emergency restrictions vaccinations. goal vaccinations prevent spread, spread.

At time, protection hospitalization serious illness remained strong. May 2 June 5, t**he efficacy rate preventing hospitalization 98.2%**, compared **with 93% June 6 July 3**. similar decline rate recorded vaccine’s efficiency preventing serious illness among people inoculated. 
 
 
These figures line ministry data show many new cases among people vaccinated, number serious cases rising much slowly, Ynet said. Last Friday, 55% newly infected vaccinated, website said. July 4, 35 serious cases coronavirus Israel, compared 21 June 19. 
 
The government considering reinstating additional coronavirus-related restrictions restoring mandate wear masks indoors public spaces. Officials also discussing whether recommend third dose vaccine, report said.

But Netherlands residents worry another lockdown looming, Diederik Gommers, ICU doctor head Netherlands' intensive care association NVIC, said BNR. 

 
""If sufficient antibodies, risk,"" Gommers said. vaccinated people worried. ""You get virus, make sick. question whether pass virus, know well yet."" terrible way treat people. I'm US expat I've never question weather I'd allowed enter country. even got stimulus checks. arent people wanted bring back manufacturing china? Well, guess succeeding virus. EDIT: feel bad though. believed lies people like Tucker Carlson GQPers. also putting everyone risk too. Ok, checked already covid need one vaccine dose baltics least today. Perhaps covid already? felt something previous year, nothing severe Trump logic: fewer test, fewer cases. Crickets Efficacy doesn’t necessarily translate hospitalization/deaths. merely illustrates effective vaccine preventing infection similar scenarios, overall prevention. 

If vaccine overwhelmingly prevents hospitalizations/deaths, rise infections, there’s issue. People continue normal countries/areas high vaccination rates. learned lesson. usually spread pain see rule broken :) Yup, delta data

Here's summary table mask enough protection surrounded covid get eyes too. Exactly. I'm sick people wear mask entire day work saying big deal. uncomfortable. Fine wear one 10 minutes run supermarket that's case lot us.

It's like wearing t-shirt. wtf. Yeah sure, agreed. pointing UK, therefore conceivably perhaps countries too, it’s always “trained professional” administering vaccine. delta variant? didn’t know Canada many cases. Isn’t Israel best source data? article doesn’t say cases going up, see pretty soon accurate imagination regard vaccine efficacy. easily hours training even get job. exactly technical job either. Im happy didnt experience devistating side affects vaccine. arm ached little whole day second shot gah horrible, reallu low level pain lifted cup sipped coffee. Stuff nightmares. effectiveness vaccines fluctuate breakthrough cases. 

However, vaccines prevent serious symptoms, hospitalizations, death still winner.

Though, long term effects covid vaxed people evolving story.

I'm America, fully vaxed pfzier, tested positive covid 14 days ago. Seems media presents dream world real one. Same, two sons moderna Remember beginning pandemic official advice lock sick child room isolate completely two weeks? Good times. another point: one dose alone notably less effective Delta variant two doses, Delta going become dominant variant wherever happen (if already). I'm Canada got first Pfizer shot May 13.

I've reading delaying second dose seems produce lasting immunity. worth, opinion, delaying bit 10-11 weeks instead 8 weeks? Covid situation good 2-3 additional weeks one dose worry me.

I also see Moderna, much bigger injection Pfizer, seems induce immunity (although side-effects too, live that). Given abundant supply vaccines here, would good idea get Moderna second dose? already widely accepted Moderna Pfizer interchangeable. eligible second shot, I've made appointment moving second shot October august good guess, compared parts world happy 33% one dose efficacy vaccine. Since hell lot better majority rest countries world. abt new data Israel? delta seems otherwise despite said likely end hospitalisation. 
Uk data tells different story current Portugal bars least need negative test (even though news today see mistakes), so, would bit different. yea, feel like everything opened bit early. Basically, need stay vigilant avoid crowds guess. awesome, AZ first province Newfoundland Canada announced blood clot stuff get PF second. Recent data Israel shows 2 weeks 2 doses Pfizer protection 64%, seems quite dubious one dose protect 70%. absolutely need mental health resources people want it. can't force people get therapy, either. Part problem convinced right, see afraid problem, saw people *not* afraid problem. going do, snatch street? mRNA new. studying decades quite familiar works reason long term human trials recently, mRNA breaking fast body even acknowledge it. recent years, discovered correct lipids(aka fat) coat breaks slower.

Good example people get vaccine.

So far I've seen 4-5 examples fully vaccinated people getting sick, everyone says lose sense taste / smell. seen anyone mention back though. I'm really curious see vaccinated helps recovering that, still go weeks / months without it. would still suck big time. Low vax areas often poorer rural areas. 

So yes please tell magically enough money uproot careers move another part country. former unreasonable expectation guarantee bad time ~~near term~~

For rest life, likely. doubt ever ""pin virus down"" sense getting rid completely. always unvaccinated populations jump into, antibodies wane without constant boosters, even absence factors animal reservoirs consider. like last novel virus we're going encounter, climate change going see accelerate dramatically.

""Zero Covid"" possibility, never moment virus became pandemic. goal vaccination defang Covid turn seasonal nuisance...much way believe dreaded Russian Flu became annoying OC43...not remove lives forever.

If people find panic-inducing, they've blinders level risk they'd cheerfully accepting prior pandemic. Canadian data cannot compared British ones, since refer *symptomatic disease* whereas Scotland also studied asymptomatic infection. 

Anyway, initial 3-week interval real world effectiveness 90+% Alpha Israel. longer interval less effectiveness UK. Therefore doubt longer interval would maintain much higher effectiveness compared shorter one Delta. Must something else. Thank you. appreciate response think hit nail head instead trying “dunk” her.

Given summary little bit logic, headline seem misleading.
Unvaccinated groups allow maintained foothold wherein virus free mutate variations better able bypass vaccination effects, thereby increasingly undoing current progress. 
Of course, scientists might make progress effective vaccinations new variants, negate fact there's likely setback near universal vaccinations. Israel, far know, vaccinated 3 weeks doses. (Like US.) UK Canada spaced doses apart, prioritizing first doses second dose. wondering longer spacing confers different level immunity, resulting higher efficacy reported UK vs. Israel Delta specifically.

Or waning immunity time, since Israel's population fully vaccinated UK even started second doses, i.e. UK's antibodies recent.

Or like said, higher viral loads.

Or factor, combination factors. Israel's efficacy truly lower, figuring going informative rest world. Wait! thought herd stupidity central US thing.

Thanks providing sources!! 26. indonesia like 500 million ppl something? gap stayed gap length cause efficacy decline. less restrictions would resulted higher viral loads could cause decline. good also surprising. already suspected vaccine lasted 6 months year Israel one early vaccinators. someone cares someone ill guidance quarantine? says vaccinated yolo. 
 says 14 days last contact. 
 
Despite saying 14 days links back first article think proved point quoting vaccine reduces spread 80%-not 100%, even 95% 80%. still chance spread, albeit lower vs unvaccinated. 

I also don’t believe advocating mask mandate merely suggested would wear advanced protection felt comfortable. see zero wrong that, even don’t feel like wearing mask circumstances. done studies collected actual data showing vaccine reduces ones ability spread disease ~80%. case numbers plummeted.

That seems prove point. Unless I'm mistaken, suggests still spread covid vaccinated. argue amount masking reduces transmissibility vaccinated individuals significant enough merit practice. 

Also curious could link studies. saying doubt claim familiar studies. seen estimates placing potential reduction transmission 61% far. really understand confusion here. thesis 600,002 things normal? Seriously. colleague “vaccine hesitant,” conversation office suggested get tested month “to keep safe.” 

What means would making feel safe. Besides fact monthly testing almost useless (you would need test everyone probably couple times week,) GOT VACCINATED. risk low, take precautions keep even lower. I’m going hassle frequent testing, won’t get vaccinated. (And yes, know isn’t medical reason she’s getting vaccinated.)

Besides, colleague big idea vax status nobody’s business own. brings testing again, I’m going say I’m comfortable disclosing if/when get tested results are. Sometimes dumb things people understand science. I’ve already miserable week. felt like going die, much anxiety.

I’m much hypochondriac hyperaware literally every feeling never know whether I’m exaggerating it’s concern even.

Right now, I’ve feeling heartbeat resting, remember reading cases teens getting heart palpitations getting vaccinated, worry might have. also don’t know it’s still covid 3 months. it’s unrelated those.

Either way, lot anxiety every single thing regarding health. Probably not, that’s going happen anti-vaxxers passing around other. info I've able find long covid vaccines is
1. less likely contract covid chances getting long covid less since can't get long covid never catch Covid.
2. Getting vaccinated reduced long covid symptoms people, eliminated long covid symptoms people effect long covid symptoms others. 
You find info CDC website. 

I've seen anything saying breakthrough infection less likely suffer long covid. understanding clear data yet. aware studies show vaccines protect getting long covid? 32M, Got first dose last Friday. 30' walking session Saturday relaxed 30' cycling Sunday, felt normal. pretending go gym today, I'm wondering lol   Agree. liked people honest knew expect, based comments Reddit friends, thought it’d way worse. mean wasn’t pleasant, didn’t side effects anticipated. Nope explained ideas looks like people agree trying find maybe wrong learn something new. karma gatherer would write something else Well, Islam predominant religion 6 recognised religions. put perspective, probably least 30 millions aren’t muslims. People use word lockdown easily. Many countries lockdown still think (and would use point effectiveness lockdowns) absolutely awful analogy tbh person Covid unvaccinated student nurse, 600 vaccinated? even care downvoted? karma gatherer? Exactly. Good input. already got nothing would able anyway.

 I'm religious like quote ""god give serenity accept things cannot change, courage change things can, wisdom know difference.""

What choices, risk getting deadly disease could possible best cause long term debilitating harm worst put ICU slowly suffocate death....or get little prick live another day. 

Why would getting vaccine long lasting affects...have ever vaccine side effects day later? Things may want ask yourself. someone dealt social anxiety life worry actually real? two dosed matter encounter that's point.. around group antivaxxers people covid still get covid like scaring people wearing masks reason living life kinda dumb..I know fully vaxxed would never take mask get fully vaxxed hopefully changes.

I'm high vaccination area worn mask month two basically. loss taste smell mindfuck. human thing really ever expect taken away us. Like life giving brown tasteless sludge eat everything. know temporary probably would entered suicidal spiral. post title says ""Study"", where's study? article summarizes way makes results totally incomprehensible. Again, black white.

Here analogy around least year. 
 saw great post epidemiologist (Your Local Epidemiologist) max we've seen 2 months Man I'm getting vaccine stuff can't pretend people problems heart expansion stuff

even chances incredibly low pretend nothing bad ever happened bad people talked covid big deal slight cough hints point towards September:

* [Fauci saying “reasonable chance” travel UK US [Officials involved joint task force saying July initial month talks moving [U.S. Secretary Commerce saying “I’m hopeful post-Labor Day see nice uptick business travel international travel. promise getting business travel international travel going top Labor Day September 6th. ""stupid"" ""smart"" different coefficients exponential function's argument. fact ""smart"" coefficient nonnegative mean glossed over. coined like 12 months ago Twitter one follows 😎😜 please provide evidence support claim non-mRNA vaccines see significant reduction efficacy severe cases Delta? Speculation get us anywhere discussion. Maybe appreciate efforts heart attack actually hospital bed go to? explains cases, deaths.

I mean, guess could test dead claim something else, excess mortality reveal real numbers.  honestly don’t know. 

Maybe saying “done” isn’t right word. virus isn’t going anywhere.

Maybe good point would children vaccinations get approved. way everyone wants protection, protected. There’s really excuse someone wants vaccine able get one point considering available (at least America)

That could also another point. vaccine available places. Grown adults agency.

If choose believe disinformation campaigns, that's them. Good. Let idiots die. Might teach fellow idiots thing two Would surprised China considering tbh. makes sense little heard, Duterte pushing vaccination threatened shoot people refuse it.

So maybe unlike Donald Turnip, Duterte using power actually something virus.   would understandable without using ""Markov chain"", obviously jargon.

*""The vaccine developed with BioNTech SE protected 64% receivers illness June 6 early July government lifted restrictions, 94% May 2 June 5, Ynet news website reported, citing Health Ministry numbers.* good. People want kneejerk absolute answers can't seem handle complexity adjustments based different circumstances. Sigh. EliminAtion Alpha lockdowns possible (see victoria, australia) takes long time try high number cases. Took us several months peak 700+ cases per day get different numbers week population, would weird.

Different numbers different populations? That's normal. would actually weird numbers regardless state immunization (natural vaccine-induced) population.

Remember, *effectiveness* relies actual population outside context clinical trial. Expectations set high great numbers original virus early variants. good vaccine. even mean?  tone deaf “go extra mile cautious enough make sure get extra added level protection.”

Are Americans dumb understand concept ""extra""? Why? 87% protection symptomatic disease Delta variant super good. protection death probably near 100% since enough data yet deaths.

Remember, vaccines prevent infections (except rare cases HPV). prevent _disease_. Sinovac problem, can't really get anything else think blame you. option get Moderna/Pfizer/JJ/AstraZeneca got wrong vaccine. Based initial information efficacy, 100% vaccinated vaccinated people would get sick would expect near 0 levels hospitalizations death. ratio suggests lowered protection current variant. 2nd AZ jab next weekend. we've learned, overall 2nd jab much less troublesome AZ previously. 

Either way better alternative pleasure knowing go lives we're fully immune couple weeks after. Four things creeps act happy this:

1. sociopathy showing. Get therapy.

2. basic survival mentality, last thing want virus changing yet again, vaccines useless.

3. I'm pissed anyone vaccine situation, refuse ignorant fact people actively lied duped believing vaccines work. average citizen believe vaccine? fallout wealthy worked spread dissent church, media, sources. problem - access intelligent discourse (that designed manipulate one way another) problem.

4. Grow fuck learn see beyond yourself. people realistically think travel open UK US? doesn’t seem sight 😞 Delta going run low efficacy vaccines. countries picked vaccines trouble. That’s inaccurate feel like CDC saying ""no need wear masks! (If vaccinated)"" made impossible stores try get people wear masks, essentially giving permission unvaccinated run around everywhere without mask.

And wow, guess - cases rising again. Indoor masks probably won’t remain. rightly so. imagine Delta variant going low efficacy vaccines China. Death really bad side effect   Yeahhhh can’t feel bad he’s vaccinated. That’s fault. 

Everyone chance get vaccine months anyone doesn’t point playing fire got first dose felt really sleepy waiting area. healthcare worker worried haha really, it? Everyone vulnerable vaccinated high rate what’s problem? Deaths quite clearly staying flat.

If exit wave happen, better height summer, time potential surge flu winter.

Can’t keep people restrictions others’ anxiety long co- sorry, post viral infection syndrome. brewing ground mutations.
That‘s gonna fuck us quite while. 22k infection /d, 143 mil population, vs, UK: 24k infection /d, 68 million population

I know FT call Russia ""shocking enormous botched"", UK 2x worse? journalistic integrity nowadays anywhere, Faux news NY Times, NewsMax Slate, WSJ Wapo, FT RT.

Always ask accurate, honest data multiple sources make judgement.  wife. terrible fever evening got vaccinated next day. 2 days later perfectly normal ready go day.

I imagine might actually gotten covid potentially hospitalized. Knowing luck probably would severe case would much worse much longer. end, know well worth day pain. 

Looking forward 2nd jab upcoming weekend moving lives. brave sounds like opinion piece. anyone know whether Pfizer others making/testing new vaccine based delta?

Second shot- didnt even feel shot side effect

Not every species able adapt changing circumstances enough survive. true viruses. case SARS-CoV-2, vaccines used west specifically target spike protein virus. protein also virus uses enter cells.

If spike protein mutates enough fully evade vaccine-induced immunity, may able bind receptors cells anymore. many changes protein undergo longer fits onto receptors.

Whether configuration spike exists different enough vaccines protecting yet still allows virus easily enter cells, unknown. possible, certainly guaranteed.

Unfortunately, appears delay inevitable Life COVID, would get four severe respiratory infections year. common sort started sore throat might progress lots productive coughing, fever, white spots foul deposits tonsils, infected sinuses. finally saw doctor, would order series skull X-rays examine sinuses, prescribing antibiotics opportunistic bacterial infection following initial possibly viral infection. would happen 4 times year would last three weeks so. Sometimes went 6 weeks. meant four skull series X-rays year, increased danger causing cancer many decades I’ve around. 

With masking hand washing, I’ve gone 15 months without respiratory infection all, first time life. I’m really eager go unmasked again. probably zealous masking crowds using hand sanitizer balance life. (I elderly, many years). Even COVID evolves “like cold,” look forward adding already endemic pathogens. What, autumn flu starts kicking in? say lets wait another 6 months Spring cycle continues.  Right. restrictions associated covid life, never understood wearing mask 20 minutes grocery store big deal people. never said people care (which said even clarified hyperbole said since then(. said people whole tend bigger reaction violent tragedies. difficult. lot people got Pfizer, though. far tell, less 50% AZ. think way rollout done important. age-based cohorts made big queue, love queuing.

Again virus suspend still air quite while, whether catch covid also depends viral load.

As OP saying, additive frankly governments world say back mar 2020 shit spread air, general population scientifically trained may interpret masks completely ineffective  can't find single source saying people Pakistan tested positive Delta variant. Positivity rates three countries Covid same. Delta variant arrived much later Pakistan still dominant strain. reason India put list Johnson wanted trade deal India. politics nothing more.

Hello TN! limited testings, close [reaching 30k cases per day (site graph show absurdity Indonesia's second wave COVID Jeez didn’t learn lesson last year?

This might third time Netherlands way chill. 
Im 34 1 vaccine baby, dont want get shot last day war people need party.  think probably right next Big Bad Variant derivative Delta.  
But important note Delta offshoot Alpha, cousin - they're B.1 derived lineages. theory could surprised emergence even dangerous variant that's cousin Delta rather offshoot. 
But speed Delta taking makes scenario less likely. Alpha rose dramatically became single prolific strain, still spent long time co-existing strains large ""market share"", Delta ultimately emerged. Delta may become overwhelmingly dominant quickly happen. 
That could end silver lining Delta's high transmissibility, we'll clear-cut target modified vaccines. lowest number places. UK ~ 80% Canada. UK especially much better sample population IMO. PHE data different Scottish data looks symptomatic disease rather infections. PHE gave 88% efficacy compared 80% Scottish analysis, i.e. comparable numbers they're looking at. corona measures right regular treatment that's complete bullshit mate, instance numerous free tests different cancers yearly high risk groups.  Prevention even *asymptomatic* disease good proxy, PHE found 79%. 

I see. currently case know vaccination provides 79% reduction transmission, though everything seems pointing significant reduction transmission. clear, absolutely arguing going 80% may 95% efficacy spreading disease worth arguing for. arguing get everyone vaccinated mandate vaccines.

Fair enough. Though two mutually exclusive. could argue masking vaccination. mandate one it'd vaccination sure. 

From understand cdc's decision, benefits masking preventative measures fully vaccinated individuals seen diminish models vaccine coverage increases, think fair say still help especially places low vaccination rates. 

Personally, much effort mask maybe marginally reduce transmission though understand feeling unnecessary live somewhere high enough coverage. Republicans told stupid jump bridge would it? fully vaccinated there's literally reason wear mask, odds transmitting covid much less odds getting serious covid even smaller. everyone trying relate version ""herd stupidity"" country Go look aftereffects covid-19. like WebMD symptom search results page.

Switzerland, people tend quite law abiding,to point perfectly normal get yelled break rules. vagon, vicinity, one guy wear it, one girl mask pulled entirely down, several noses out. think wearing mask get fine, still, can't get wear it.

Yea that's also true, that's (as mentioned before) scientists' advice compare different vaccines. problem people it, know someone ""proudly"" seeking booster shots without reason US, like ones J&amp;J jabs go pfizer moderna booster. That's insane, countries really low vaccination rates see people go unnecessary doses based nothing.

We focus 2 things: vaccines preventing hospitalization death, let's guarantee access vaccination people around world. lack equity fairness main problem facing Covid, lack efficacy vaccines. That's really scares me. Actually....IHME 880,000k+ deaths yeah, bad.(Note: Excess deaths) Thank posting links. think abundance caution best plan. bad US collectively bullheaded. ahhh seems like horrific news, reason think happen US??? vaccine 100% effective.  always dichotomy masks vaccination? single person arguing vaccination. *Obviously* everybody get vaccinated, also obviously (as numbers show) far vaccination sufficient get incidence rate acceptable levels. hard understand long transmission high (despite vaccination) better *also* increase protection wearing masks.

If vaccines give 80% protection (to go u/polit1337's numbers) leaves 20% risk. masks also provide 80% protection reduce risk 20% 20%, i.e. 4%. anybody possibly argue that? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Something watch, data published like Public Health England. none us thread advocating lockdown continue; results return ‘normality’ big ways seen, small, trouble free mitigations could usefully continued. argument see. right mask wearing pointless, would enable demonstrated. wrong, would able assess positive effect make better decisions. High filtration masks also protect wearer extent. restrictions cannot feasibly carry forever.

Goalposts moved. hospitalization rates deaths count. Covid zero name game now, fight never course. people need remain masks, walled humanity afraid.

Yay us! little hospitalizations. sure people panicking  said often, completely true, however whole story.

Well suggest? going get global suppression covid, going keep borders closed years we've vaccinated world, actually think done without enacting global dictatorship?

Even lowest vaccinated counties least 50%+ adults vaccinated. think fine. bad hilarious. Finland beats US almost metrics used, except:

\- Predicted GDP, year-on-year, growth. US faced tremendous economic turmoil last year, course they'll bounce back higher. Finland suffer economically.

\- People covered vaccines. meaningful factor US. managed capture biggest bag vaccines, taking giant leap gaining herd immunity. still worse covid situation (positive test ratio, infections deaths per capita), need vaccines Finland.

\- Lockdown severity. idea saying here. practically restrictions anymore. had, mainly limit mass gatherings restaurants. mask mandates, curfews.

\- Flight Capacity &amp; Vaccinated Travel routes: two make biggest difference. Flight much limited right now. people probably miss flying, hand domestic tourism booming. lot places reporting record high sales since people can't go abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

On otherhand, Finland beats US meaningless stats as

* 1-MONTH CASES PER 100,000
* 1-MONTH CASE FATALITY RATE
* TOTAL DEATHS PER 1 MILLION
* POSITIVE TEST RATE
* COMMUNITY MOBILITY
* UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE
* HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX understand hesitancy. what's argument? long disease rare, vaccine dangerous? ""As long"" skating thin ice, melts people stop restraining normal activities. less contagious variant infected dozen people less two years ago, world far contagious variants. takes Australians week disease could spiral ot control. two dose vaccines take weeks months complete. actually stupidly urgent rather not.

And what's run side effects? Inflamation random body part resolves itself, nothing compared inflammation caused actual virus? Possibly Alzheimers could happen, somehow, proteins funky let's creative imagine absurdly awful unprovable things?  booster would probably beneficial theoretically, unnecessary. now, 2 doses AZ appear effective. Or, least wait time information additional boosters recommended. Unless you’re immunocompromised old, need take 3rd dose. great learn what's happening ""under hood"", speak. However proof pudding, people important thing understanding resulting comparative protection symptomatic infection, hospitalization, death. Never watched ice hockey game? really rarity US. We've outside dining several times since Pandemic winding we've like, ""It's much like Europe!"" 


It's best. totally agree, really hope keep it.  would almost 90% population immune virus. stupid? Almost EU countries similar rates, fewer good bad outliers. France isnt well poorly compared peers Europe. almost identical rates Ireland instance rather well ahead. Ireland 68% adult population least one jab 48% fully vaccinated. think thats equivalent 52% entire population dont exact ratio adults children.

Any difference may seen likely due date figures come from. American here, explain they’ve screwed rollout?  argument move lockdown end end July order vaccinate people ensure everyone able first jab. acceptable move goalposts wait another two months everyone double jabbed. public lost support measures desperate end. Saturday night, pubs packed people chanting, singing, dancing hugging. mask site. numbers wearing masks public transport, taxis shops slowly diminishing. 

The government given controlling delta acknowledged rates would go lockdown ended. youth free take risks vulnerable long since vaccinated. Didn’t know Canadians get angry, 1% rate death vs 99.8% living though covid. dumbest headline yet, take downvote. get twice? work high risk field? Close, cigar  really place access vaccines less likely select varient evades vaccine - it’s likely gain steam it’s contagious non-vaccinated Technically impossibly incorrect. Probably won’t see peak high US. Pfizer vaccine still incredibly effective delta variant imagine Moderna well. approach 50% population fully vaccinated, well people previously virus protection, virus harder time spreading probably easiest place get shot either pfizer moderna. that, less protected, even delta. Yes! Since April   we’re clear, it’s unlikely critical mass children ever get vaccinated. countries even 12-15 May cancelled cost benefit analysis Covid non risky kids Well... DUUUUH Holy fuck can't everyone think like this. lucid comment seen. truly hope get sick miss time work. Someone live US. =( local Facebook group asshat telling everyone “avoid vaccine take HCQN get COVID.”

These people absolutely lost. Hmmmm, seem match data England IIRC put Pfizer higher effectiveness. Wonder difference lies. chunk healthcare workers think know better simply vaccinate. must unusually rule-following area France. Paris almost one wearing masks correctly still required (buses, metro, etc.), large number people even bothering wear chins more. enforcement speak of. vaccine certainly shield - correct way think it. 100% shield, however. you’re sick days/PTO (or, worse, don’t begin with), nope  Ahh, already true then. people lack access can’t risk taking time work deal side effects. 
There people choose everyone. know couple people said things like ""I trust vaccines"" ""this part big plan"" still got vaccine.  looked restrictions citizens permanent residents family allowed back Complications? load vax cargo plane ship out. Yes, Russia needs distribution plan. Russia Putin took over, among top five smartest countries; what? distribution needs made.  Til 2036. I'd laugh tragic.

Post learn figure out, probably, complications are. Somebody get enough financial reward? girlfriend played extremely safe entire time got vaccinated March. two weeks following second doses, ditched masks. mentally exhausted super cautious trying protect big portion population doesn’t want protecting living alternate reality. shorten duration 3-4 weeks like US done since start. seems like supply would get people fully vaccinated way faster.

If US huge reservoir virus spring 2020 winter 2021, maybe India spread India badly. fair. really Sydney atm. Queensland 4 cases yesterday states stamped cases week two. 
The NSW government decided try way get control, even though stage know whats needed.
It somewhat backfired... That's lot ""mights"" ""maybies"" sound like justification government intervention. Nothing? - , AFAIK, yet definitive data a) many new cases vaccinated b) many cases vaccine AZ oppossed Pfizer (the two main types used UK).

There equivolent surge hospitalisations new deaths (as yet). Per Capita death rates currently line US Western Europe.

Back October last year, somebody offerred vaccine words - ""you might still get sick, unlikely need hospitalisation die virus"" - I'd taken that. Wait, don’t get paid work? You’re shouldn’t dismissive, vaccines less effective vs newer variants newer variants virulent…

Young children people certain health conditions cannot vaccinated still carry virus unknowingly get others sick…

Don’t selfish Yes, adults right determine appetite risk. confident. Covid twice. first time breezed past it, second time ended hospital praying god I'd see another day. That's really strange; number UK 88%. UK doses 12-week interval give better end result. 64% good number US, means want booster shots fairly soon. I’m fully vaccinated I’m going wear mask protect people refuse get vaccinated. charts literally mark when: 

""Masks required statewide""

""Some capacity restrictions end""

PestFix manufacturer, intermediary (its founder calls public health supply business ): role order gowns China. sounds absolutely terrible. I'm sorry I'm glad kids yet. remember downvoted sub said going continue wearing mask even though I’m vaccinated. less week ago very, young first vaccine. Everyone else ample time first vaccine. R-value 8??! Jesus, scary. society opening up, too? mean going see peak higher January? response indoor dining regulations ton restaurants converted street parking patio areas tons previously indoor places outdoor section. demographics part GOP? What's excuse? much hassle, expensive, little benefit Canada. benefit would primarily upon country person living.

Canada vaccinating foreign residents here; Canadians living abroad subject vaccination policies country choose live.

Don't like it? citizen - move home anytime. Exactly Since prevalence covid Australia low, understand vaccine hesitancy arises. think many starting warm notion vaccines path least resistance, viable path, towards normalcy.

In way, state affairs may need get worse terms covid outbreaks motivate people get vaccinated. similar vein, think interesting theres substantial recent uptick vaccinations Russia appear coincide another surge covid cases. threat covid low, urgency vaccinate. think mean ""Darwinism"". ""Social Darwinism"" something else.  outdoor dining venues US? pretty common UK think Biden still somehow better choice Yeah smart Netherlands Scandinavia. Outside masking never made ton sense. 50% increase new cases sounds nothing right? 95% people infinite time, spending 5 days vacation empty room extremely disincentivizing. coworker would ask “but why” Using classic pay lots money giant supply vaccines cheat code works again. get it, thank you! Yes, unless whole world vaccinated, mutations continue occur. Also, vaccines effective variants thus far. That’s likely come third world, densely populated countries low vax rates US tbh.  Prior infection protective also. We’re Better position you’d think older still.  silly. opposite month. New cases rocket UK, government keeps opening up. Health workers beg government keep mask mandates social distancing place, government happily ditches them. daily new cases UK 5000% higher Germany, government probably moving Germany amber list red list next. Time think US citizenship.

Canada gives non-citizens permanent residency right entry citizens (though take status away commit major crime). US could adopt similar policy, too. first option one control. Chance infection outside extremely low, France stopped requiring couple weeks ago. Interestingly, Netherlands Scandinavia, masking never required outside never reported main source infections. Cell reactivity Vaccination prior infection crushes variants. need worry people aren’t vaccinated history prior infection that’s becoming small minority. They'll probably approve approved vaccines. least US uni demands would assume didnt need wear masks indoors didnt need wear masks indoors more. I'm still wearing mine. I’m dictating anything. analogy seatbelt dosnt cut logic all. 

I don’t think understand nuance situation applying binary logic it. It’s “wear mask” “don’t wear mask”. It’s minimizing risk. 

I don’t wear mask restaurant friends often hang together, vaccinated, like friends also try minimize risk. slightly larger event I’m meeting new people, wear mask unless decide risk low. 

I wear mask going grocery shopping since I’m crowded indoor space, hundreds people, poor ventilation, knowing vaccinated asymptomatic. so, minimize risk friends meet without mask. 


Why hard understand? We’ve year virus circulating, thousands deaths, billions dollars economic loss, trillions next 70 years so…. without capability thinking nuance.

So… dictating anything, fairly obvious situations scenarios masks helpful situations go without. Obviously Democrats releasing Covid infected illegal immigrants areas make look like choice stay “free” problem. /s vaccinated? Ignore last comment. discovered google looked myself. 55% initial vaccination indeed near 70% either. I'll take US relies lot Moderna then? remained little longer.

In words, answer restrictions lifted always ""2 weeks!"". Yep. cannot separate plenty vaccine (or anything) inequitable access health services distributed US. Privilege thing Lol. knew one them. I'd bet money actually get vaccinated either. There's 5G microchips those, ya know! careful. criteria stop wearing mask vaccinated person considered selfish? want specifics. takes two doses full regimen like taking half time result football match… many, I've heard joke, ""We went fight hockey game broke out."" came back Keys yesterday started stuffy nose scratchy throat plane. got home last night, started light cough morning noticed cinnamon spice oatmeal nearly flavorless. Around 20 minutes ago tested positive. got one mRNA vaccines Jan/Feb minor symptoms far; hopefully ends nothing extra days work. rat-licking, anti-vaxx idiots way. happily keep getting COVID watch aging relatives die ventilators makes feel like they’re “owning libs”. 96% people 60 antibodies covid (ONS data), enough, is? Literally one thread asking complete restriction daily life. Stop fighting strawmen. people saying perhaps would better remaining precautions remained little longer.

There middle ground precautions total restriction (in cases). Stop pretending isn't. Possibly. cases laying dormant periods time. probably signed GETTR, ""oppressed"" first vaccinations? makes sense even mean way. day pandemic ends fixed time. Think delta today end day.

If taking actions keeps day stable makes happen earlier time, day getting closer.

If situation worsening, theoretical end may pushed one day every day passes. scenario, day *do not* get closer it. Fortunately, 75% adults state fully vaccinated

::sigh:: must nice. ""closer ever end pandemic"" ... yeah, mean... that's time works. TIL 96 percent British surveyed way sense 90 percent trifling co workers. wait hits deep south. people saying masking isn’t forever strangely don’t end date mind wonder “anti-maskers” think want mask forever.

Suggesting end date would little guess due complex fluid circumstances. fixed end date mean majority want end date. people line thinking? Masks won’t mandated forever, literally doesn’t impact people decide keep wearing one yeah, goal 70% yesterday missed football field. disagree everyone described outdoor dining ""rare"" ""afterthought"" pre-covid.

There always large numbers places patios, least large-ish cities. 

However, covid forced many places dramatically expand size patios (into parking lots or, many places, street). post covid ? people dying months initial infection. getting hospitalized. Since studies take consideration, hospitalization death acute disease, can't really take number granted. Unless vaccine prevents long term complication, organ damage, post covid, hospitalization death yes, need vaccine post covid ? people dying months initial infection. getting hospitalized. Since studies take consideration, hospitalization death acute disease, can't really take number granted. Unless vaccine prevents long term complication, organ damage, post covid, hospitalization death yes, need vaccine good get infected. Otherwise, lot people trouble, long term complications appear even initial mild infection There's official definition forget. know two *genetic* sequence tests demonstrating different variants, recent genetic test identifying variant existence early positive confirmation, valid. that's kinda obvious.

There pos/neg/pos criterion too... Like four negative tests followed positive.

But think also simply way declare re-infection via timing. Like two positives number days apart, sounds like meet. literally making dumbass assumptions people dont know wont ever fucking talk to

God damn wish people would stop shit let amount nuanced conversation happen Yes. Risking teacher’s lives quite comical! post covid ? people dying months initial infection. getting hospitalized. Since studies take consideration, hospitalization death acute disease, can't really take number granted. Unless vaccine prevents long term complication, organ damage, post covid, hospitalization death yes, need vaccine good get infected. Otherwise, lot people trouble, long term complications appear even initial mild infection That's really horrible. I'm sorry Nah, parking lobby say. It’s worth writing city councillors express preference. city parking spots front restos would need converted that’s lost parking revenue city. Cost/Benefit would need framed lost parking revenue brings increased economic benefits ways.  Well technically… ""a tiny mask"", mandate **ALL** situations, including fully vaccinated people alone outdoors. 

If zero discomfort wearing them, seem suggest, since mock notion individual freedoms, that's logical step. Yeah, mate (only one) bit 'don't know what's it', reminded recreationally smashes bag white power stranger hands every weekend. credit conceded on, got vaccinated next week. That’s bad then, time I’d gotten I’ll honest forgot looking for. mean guess don’t need say read article feel like I’m context it’s pretty relevant. honestly, seems like focus non-issue. tried lifting *some* capacity enforcements, annoyingly didn’t specify were, didn’t work. capacity stuff, mask mandate wasn’t removed then. they’ve lifted mask mandate, numbers looking pretty good, believe article said 2.3% hospital beds belonged Covid patients, would agree? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha guessing omg fucking funny. 🤣🤣🤣 No, 1000 cases per day last week. extra testing results 200 300 extra cases detected. right! convinced anti-Vaxx groups rub potato got shot, sucks toxins  Absolutely betcha am! 
I’m sure saw post history. 

Did see part teach 500 maskless kids every week?! didn’t around maskless people flight Cancun…. Hmmmm. Kinda strange traveling safer teaching bunch Texas children. Finished Az Pf combo couple weeks ago. great info! Thousands people, whose ages average far younger average COVID victim, die every year. want eliminate almost traffic? want commit mass murder, you? favor government imposed masks death rates fallen 98%+, eliminating traffic prevent thousands deaths year least do. Also that’s doses variant new, research early days.

But Professor Turville said far, mortality rates data looked promising.

""Looking 28-day follow infection, death rate original variants 1.9 per cent mortality,"" said.

""So far Delta variant showing 0.3 per cent mortality.

""That's super encouraging. early signs look promising, early definitive.""” Yep. last words many patients hospital “Covids hoax” 50% Netherlands now. Wait, miss it? Oh fuck studies indicating wearer received benefit well. I'm referring homemade masks, medical grade. Clearly offer protection wearer. Pfizer 88% effective delta vs 95% original variant explains fraction, maybe quarter rise cases. Damn, Vietnam well long time... :(  total vaccinations? I've two anti-vax leaflets door. always closer ever event future I’ve never heard it’s less deadly. Ever. Link me. It’s common type 1 diagnosed children variety acute infections. 

Also I’d bet money you’re one types fighting person learning vacationing resorts countries Mask indoors, outdoors, unless know I'm surrounded vaccinated folks. least!

That's approach I'm taking experience Delta. feels right me. best kind correct. Totem! agree. never stopped wearing self protective mask (sealed around face) indoors strangers. don’t know efforts good enough since one else wearing mask now. That’s I’m frustrated. would nice Fauci speak months ago. Maybe would matter, maybe not. 🤷‍♀️  think we're fault though still wearing masks. Like mask shame. unnecessary - maybe bit, nobody knows sure. I'm saying Hawaii lowest covid cases states, even tourists; meanwhile, Florida hitting 5% positivity rate.  agree. It'll probably stick around like flu virus. see called cold/flu/COVID season time year on. None vaccines effective enough stopping everyone catching delta variant current vaccination level.

However, effective preventing people becoming seriously ill dying far important thing.

Also one aspect age system used covid vaccinations UK young people either vaccinated, got first one. means people age group, spend time together, effectively unvaccinated allowing spread populations incredibly quickly.

In US young people access vaccines longer, vaccine hesitancy means unvaccinated spread across age groups help limit spread bit (but probably cause deaths overall). people afraid wear masks &amp; get vaccinated. cite actual journal rather vaguely claiming Big Science™ supports you? live life.

Sure do, known two friends post viral infection syndrome much living get that. One glandular fever 18 - ended bed 6 months, delay exams year, university entrance two - lot life terms forever 18. serious - energetic guy lab technician, early 20, keen motorbike tourer much else. Similar story case took 5 years recover, wrecked career progression left permanent mark life.

Obviously decades covid.

It's rather easy get tunnel vision deaths, think that's mistake. ""However, figures, first reported Ynet news portal, indicate vaccine 93 per cent effective serious illness hospitalisation.""

better scare mothers  Chicago expanded outdoor dining great. hot spots around town much better without cars.

I really hope closing roads expand dining space stays around want make car/driving analogy? OK fine.

I might particularly like speed limits, traffic lights, taking car MOT, etc. accept they're necessary mitigate risk driving minor things preferable complete driving ban go back man walking front red flag.

Similarly masks tests, slightly uncomfortable, help mitigate risks pandemic even remotely difficult another lockdown would be.  Actually, thought [some protection per CDC. even self-protection, wear mask protect others? Wearing mask doesn’t help protect much helps protect you. Considering people masked you’ll still lot risk around gotta add population age 12. sun relative way older,

I'm technically minded, positive PCR test COVID April 2020 positive PCR test COVID Jan 2021. Ergo, two covid infections? antivaxxer family went stadium concert weekend. Finally Draconian rules ending Good luck getting negative. curiosity, go cvs, etc... dr's office N95 readily available Lmao 140k year ok poor Cool, next time talk like adult say there's *some* evidence might possibly maybe lab created give source theory... that, theory, even according science linking. know *wasn't* lab created, know *was* except phrased like certain proven makes sound like asinine ""but Facebook said so"" lunatic. sound like people raging seat-belts cars made mandatory.

It’s depressing many anti vax people around me, yet people countries would gladly take shot.  would liberals kill voters lol. article:

In March 2020, global health leaders generally believed thing SARS-CoV-2: spread known large-droplet transmission. 
When people talk — cough, sneeze, exhale, sing — lots microscopic spittle various sizes comes flying out. large-droplet transmission, virus hides biggest globs spit, which, size, can’t fly far. Instead, land tabletops door knobs and, perhaps, faces people standing close by. People touch surfaces hands, rub eyes wipe noses unwittingly usher virus bodies. 
This health experts long believed common viruses, flu, spread. gave rise common recommendations protecting COVID-19, sanitizing surfaces. 
That run bleach wipes last spring? everyone told SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily large-droplet transmission. 
There’s another way viruses spread, though, plays Jimenez’s atmospheric chemists’ strong suit. Alongside big droplets spit come flying mouths tiny droplets called aerosols. don’t plop Earth within feet. Instead, aerosols hang air minutes time. ride wind. 
Viruses hide within aerosols float air breathed next person transmission chain. it’s possible jump people standing farther 6 feet apart — oft repeated distance global health leaders recommended physical spacing prevent spread. (Jimenez, however, believes keeping distance others help control coronavirus spread creates space aerosols disperse.) 
Measles, tuberculosis chickenpox spread via aerosols, though Jimenez said health experts slow recognize airborne spread three viruses. him, COVID-19 pandemic history repeating itself. 
In late-March 2020, less three weeks Washington state choir practice, World Health Organization posted message Twitter rejecting idea SARS-CoV-2 spread aerosols. 
“FACT: #COVID19 airborne,” tweet, still up, states. “The #coronavirus mainly transmitted droplets generated infected person coughs, sneezes speaks.” 
It possible, course, viruses spread multiple methods. reckless world health leaders conclusively side one method transmission SARS-CoV-2 exclusion another, Jimenez said. know people can't vaccinated, people need desperately getting vaccinated get afford safety herd immunity.

Ok, honest. strong action fly anywhere world except China North Korea. Results matter achieved them, like steps viable option nations.

Pasco County, positivity rate week 4.9% compared 4.2% June 18-24, 3.9% June 11-17 5.2% June 4-10.

Interesting Pasco worse Pinellas. sure happened. We've also reported deaths Gamma Delta. 

I can't express helpless population Pasco is...most concerned seniors got shots, smart 30-55s too, occasional 18-30 year old...and smart concerned mothers got kids vaxxed, large population religious anti-vaxxers, drug addicts, non-English speaking Hispanics, Conservative anti-COVID Q followers. Oh, mention Libertarians? Wait- also rural farmers cut society purpose, like Quakers. None get vaccinated. gotten *half* population vaxxed. 

I brace fallout. going rough Urgent Care center. many stats keep using 18+ 12+ eligible months? pad stats look better?   idaho, wyoming, Mississippi, Louisiana still 40% one shot. take number double double might close actual number. many people thinking Grandma sheltering place. Gee thanks going buy Pfizer/Moderna local supermarket. Deadly vs life long debilitation.

Add 40% growth cases week week even summer decent vaccinations it’s looking great American colonies help overthrow crown 245 years ago. Ooooooh nooooo! Look guys, consequences. Lol imagine wanting change governmental system outdated, unfair, completely original design CDC lifted mask recommendation *for fully vaccinated individuals*, lack leadership Florida made easy vaccinated abandon masks.

At point unvaccinated people anywhere country told longer need wearing masks. think meant say 12% risk relative someone unvaccinated? 


Yes, fixed low hanging fruit, though kind cringe use we've turned meme sub now. Winter sports could another.

I assumed this... Driving risky many people make be. worked stats, risk needing medical help like 1/120,000 trips average. risk death like 1/15,000,000 trips average. I'm pretty sure risk covid wee bit higher that. 

Winter sports interesting one thought about... stats get even better comes hospitalizations rates vaccinated people.

Yeah, demographic's risk par flu hospitalization. already ADHD, throw sleeping problems brain fog, I'd f'ing hosed. Me, working theme park: Epic said back population. That's automatic vote. Except states red map blue, like PA MD Lol, elaborate salty folks?

I ties countries. point insurance companies say, “Nope don’t cover Covid illness non-vaccinated people valid reason vaccinated”? soon FDA fully approves one vaccines? point: fuck’em. I’m done caring people despise me. really understand confusion here. thesis 3 things normal? mean met people? Heart disease going top cause death western countries. Stroke also near top list. best antivaxxers claiming vaccine always fake. lived low vaccination area, I'd move. obviously care community neighbors.

If getting simple shot hard, apathy probably extends permeates dozen ways comes living community. things I’ve listed normal. I’m sorry you’ve deal that. coworker unvaxed.

Florida man, Missouri woman.. LOL Yes. Like everyone's favorite, Jacinda Adern. idea ""taking one team prove safe"" ludicrous, given many hundreds millions people around world already received Pfizer jabs point! articles give impression idea give protection

So idea pushed many angles, start think could true 

All I’m saying help

I mean would get believed even work? know couple people went like month ago. Although don’t know details it, know quarantine Don’t forget, that’s *best* work Trump Co. did. ***BEST.*** Yaaargh! democracies leader dying lead major policy changes chain succession clear tye leader representing position party anyway. People live vacuum, die take others them, even vaccine weak immune system able fight end infected. Damn idea bad. Thanks well written reply. Majoritarian rule always follow oppression. many examples exist everywhere. 

On separate note kuffar? 
Is like people India call kaafir? non believer Islam? fastest months trials check side effects, months make even distribute it. would back square one population. secrete price supposed ""non-profit""? Lol thanks reminding me! Man seems like ages ago.  that's extreme. extreme anti-vaxers complaining civil liberties, protesting lying sundry. ones saying Covid hoax people died it. Stay strong friend. 

It like India like two months back. hard see many close ones die. depressing hear phone ring everyday my.parents receiving news deaths. 

It end soon. Stay home stay safe. Eat well. Drink well. Seems logical me, bothered wearing one, continuing highest risk situations makes sense me. policy decision longer require logical considering available data, also enjoy getting sick anymore. Every AZ dose save something like 1/1000 life. Rich countries paying front giving COVAX turns even better vaccines badge shame. going specific business. sure? planning go (obviously current state) country/island still seems closed. really counts truly failed - initial preventative actions policies would saved lives stymied virus first place. would every country beat every measure. 

Let’s inject bleach veins shining light inside bodies. ^s  OP troll. Why? like pay it, lose 15 minutes get protection virus, even new strain failing beat vaccine. None us  love reporting kinds posts. Agreed, reasoning behind lifting mask mandates logical considering circumstances available data, also minimal effort continue wear mask indoors around people know keep even though fully vaccinated several months. Yeah, I've seen videos people attending funeral beloved scholar. Thousands crowding street, maskless heart Karachi. way place like better Brazil. need name call. Pasco, Florida US residents, UK residents. second dose helps protection covid significantly, particularly boosting longevity immunity. understand, antibodies decrease time, second shot creates lots memory cells body uses fight infections road. get second dose. heard westerners (some unvaccinated) already going Bali. quarantine requirement work warehouse (production work) it’s difficult. guess it’s different everyone, people job wear masks correctly even though it’s hot.

Like someone mentioned, feels like putting shirt. Better read: don’t delete comments :) fact 600,000 unnecessary deaths isn’t normal. Great related read: realize Moderna Pfizer unlimited production capacity? question paying it. Yeah, understand they've come determination. say vaccine though, strategy left vulnerable outbreaks far behind many countries vaccinations subsequent reopenings, large parts country lockdown lockdowns probably continue next months least.  Generally means half country doses single shot J&amp;J mixed in. Again, inevitable sunrise.

But borders exiled citizens normal admit total number cases US still nearly 30 million Russia! 

Pay attention virus, get vaccine, defeat it! humans together.  It’s entirely relevant, especially situation given previous President continuously downplayed it, many politicians/citizens claimed wasn’t real.  People wondering US hoarded vaccines. highest death rate give million dollar lotteries convince people get vax that's immediately available anywhere. We're point simply can't give away convinced take it. time export protect global population totally willing protect themselves. Deniers countries another problem, let's get everyone innoculated defend growing threat. like us US. Ugh. is, would undergo significant transformation That’s good reason. American citizens already coming back abroad quarantine. variant exists world come regardless. Yet NZ hasn’t national lockdown year. Seems you’re using lame false excuse avoid acknowledging deaths country has. Sorry. We'll see, hopefully yes. Personally, ditching mine come midnight July 19th get waiver let tax payers pay bill? knew risk travelling reasoning bill rushed parliament, BS. yet vast majority population stay home cancelling weddings, attending funerals visiting love ones abroad. Americans won’t follow quarantine. it’s reasonably policy.  you’re living best, special, deep super meaningful/neato existence, pour one folks loved ones can’t get vaccinated- source essential knowledge them. ☹️

It’s privilege care. grateful.   Easy, refuse fine 500€ + 50€ additional day show up, cut social benefits receive them, etc. 98.3% covid hospitalizations Arkansas since January 26 unvaccinated. countries 12 weeks AZ. Social media propaganda I'd say.    sort thing happen hospitals. put blind faith healthcare professionals - take charge health double check work. Ask see bottle they're inject you. agree completely, don’t understand isn’t nobrainer everyone. super depressing seeing people actually believe damage causes. Conspiracies used rare nutjob, first time I've seen stupid beliefs wide scale globally.

How people think catching creepy virus leaking China less risky health vaccine made controlled environment sole purpose protect (and proving work AMAZING thus far). Again, lockdowns NZ. Get facts straight. Sorry :) Always ask see bottle injected with. That's idea, right? They're shutting doors achieve vaccination. That's one 25 people get Covid fully vaccinated. health England COVID-19 far dangerous shot

One Colorado scientist’s uphill fight convince world coronavirus spreads air 

The headline overdramatic misleading... question airborne covid19 raised many scientists

Here article April 2, 2020: anything, real issue stubbornly insisting airborne transmission unproven even overwhelming evidence it..     Omg love it. Perfect official term Yes shit US people know smart?  closed outdoor dining Hollywood movies allowed keep open.... No. wrote still see there. convince people crackpot theories “airborne transmission”... Stupid people die they’re stupid. Frankly chance choose wrong. Fuck um. actually feel bad much rest world still waiting vaccine. politicization CONSERVATIVES, mind you. ""both sides"" all. Thousands dead Trump, GOP, Fox News. clear Hispanic African uptake better Republicans. MD recently 4th state vacinate 50% Hispanics even though 75% adults general.

There still work do. Well never know antibodies show vaccine, might well get second dose sure. may able completely stop something naturally mutates people vaccine, herd immunity, less vectors less likely mutate every time jumps another person. mean get boosters new stains flu yet, new strains polio worry so.... grant data mind refers Pfizer AZ Moderna. also symptomatic infection mind, rather hospitalisation/death risk, stat quoting (and also worth bearing mind lower CI bound 72% protection hospitalisation/death). 

Nevertheless - Canadian study good news one dose efficacy, also substantiates protection increases two doses. source: ""2 doses likely provide even higher protection"".

In conclusion - one dose good, two doses better, need read actual myocarditis risk well get better understanding risk assessment broadly. 

If felt negative cardiac response first dose, tell doctor it. think get second dose, fair enough. tell worry, good go. vaccine rather gene alterning drug.

No not. even concern trolling anymore, literally parroting antivax bs now.The mRNA vaccines gets consumed eventually destroyed cells cannot transcribed back DNA. goes DNA adenoviral vaccines.

And even could (which can't), would mean literally every single time catch cold would *also* alter DNA anyway, would point worrying happens time?

You need stop getting information Alex atletic good diet? 30 years old person, without good diet exercising weak body.

He looks healthy average 30 yo research vaccine thought safe.

And is. Myocarditis following infection [is orders magnitude following vaccine.  
And guess what? people article young athletic. Technically current advice Novavax/the health authorities get double dose another vaccine mixing vaccines tested. Something suspicious going on, think Novavax would keen get approval clear article Novavax causing delay - applied approval yet. Meanwhile thousands volunteers across world left limbo. one forced take vaccine without long term (multi year) safety studies particular vaccines MRNA vaccine technology general. tech rushed tested extent vaccines. saying Sinovac reduced effectiveness compared AZ. Chill. 

Sinovac ~50% efficacy symptomatic covid-19, 

source: ~64% efficacy symptomatic covid-19 Delta Variant

Source: choice. Sad meant would also one-up since it’s one place don’t risk infecting patients Director AstraZeneca former federal govt lobbyist Kieran Schneemann.
He former Chief Staff Liberal party.
He also John Howard's cabinet secretary. stories already coming huh. 

Damn Can’t leave study?  This. lower number lancet study find, said efficacy infections 79% delta.

This scientific study conditions known. could contain errors.

Nonetheless, still good severe symptoms, means infections mutations happen unvaccinated vaccinated people. Yeah also ""Full"" MCO month still getting number cases MCO4.0? (lost count) started.... ""Enhanced"" MCO full full.

MCO, CMCO, RMCO, FMCO, EMCO, PKPB, PKPD, PKBC... guys seriously take prize confusing fuck up. Going run letters alphabet soon rate.

What Malaysia giving every god damn thing fucking acronym? problem long developing country low income suppose lock limit lives? 18 months now, enough vaccines least another year two? Yes. Immune escape obvious evolutive path keep virus viable new immunological landscape. unless go full Zero Covid (which impracticable) bound happen. question whether mutations render virus less dangerous flexible virus produce new mutations. IIRC article claiming measles, polio previously endemic virus exhibit features allow escape vaccines. 

The statistics regarding infections concerning, guess still preliminary need corrected exposure (e.g. vaccinated people might taking risks). time protection serious illness still promising. Exactly one tylenol 35 bucks?? much morphine? take morphine.  virus spread self studies shown physical reaction person affect antibody production. soon 2nd shot get antibodies tested?

I told friend cancer getting antibody test, 6 months since second shot… came back negative antibodies. oncologist isn’t concerned bc said immune factors present (which aren’t tested for, memory cells/etc). Hard know do. think I’d seek 3rd shot… man tested. Got negative result. Decided go bar, full people. Turns got wrong results, positive.

That's got title, seems fine me. that's four times likely get seriously ill delta. Wow. worry getting covid? severe case? Death, long term effects covid (loss smell, taste, requiring oxygen, lung damage, heart neurological effects)?

I’m asking potential long term effects infection far higher (hypothetical) risk long term effects vaccine.

At point, you’re vaccinated, you’ll get infected, unless live country manages eradicate covid never travel it. standpoint managing anxiety, basically choice mitigate risk getting vaccinated rather wait naturally infected. Same, except vaxed March.

Has wife loss smell taste?

No symptoms affected me. able taste food sucks. Russian enormous amount unreported deaths. half million already died, absolutely abysmal. Equivalent million US deaths. This! covid right vaccines allowed general public (missed vaccine date like 2 days). still got shot I’m pregnant, family don’t want get covid ever again. 

Covid vs side effects vaccine... I’ll take 2 days feeling like crap 9 days feeling like death increased vaccinated population, evaluation criteria must changed case numbers, hospitalisations deaths. Still 93% hospitalized, couple percent. makes sense delta may transmissible. data shows Pfizer still great job protect serious illness, worried. 

This article headline clickbaity makes seem like Pfizer vaccine dropping ball worse somehow others case. Stronger wave, positive sentiment symptoms milder that. 

Except losing sense taste smell. 

That's still gone I'm hoping back couple weeks. 

Fully vaxed caught covid 14 days ago. stories ""oh got vaccinated nearly died"" helpful.

I agree. vaccine hesitancy due ""I heard bad side effects can't miss day work, I'm holding getting shot."" live low-vax part higher vax state, I’m still wearing mask go inside businesses. Actually wearing mask almost exclusively effects people nothing actual mask wearer unless we’re talking fitted filter mask. Thank providing context. looking granular detail Israel makes sense assume cases older people. thought that. 
It always interesting (as person presents data regularly job), data never lies way presented really impact take away. felt absolutely nothing, I'm part study I'm tested antibodies month. treated three weeks first dose (Pfizer) first time letter came back saying positive antibodies. husband two weeks first dose (AZ, moderate side effects) also came back positive antibodies, surprising. Everyone's ""mileage"" different many unvaccinated folks feel low risk hospitalization, unlikely wear masks anywhere. countries trying combination 2 different doses delta varient.. clearly suggest single pharma dose sufficient No, isnt really chance hospitalized. delta infections vaccinated people asymptomatic extremely mild. co-worker mine seriously said didn’t want second shot arm sore. Great question! First off, sorry misspelled it. spelled ""Arkansan"" pronounced Ar-can-zin. stupid embarrassing question coming president US. one common sense 5th grade understanding science would ever ask. Ever. Trump award biggest moronic president ever. He’s even ranked bottom 5 worst presidents.  are, rare. feeling ""I got beat crowd""

That's actually accurate description feeling heard/read. exactly felt.  (my daughters I) also Pfizer. bit sleepy mild headaches sore arms first dose, mildly sore arms second. expecting second shot worse. can’t believe people obtuse. Since cloth mask protect infection? Since vaccinated people spreading COVID? poor countries choice. not. rough time it. One almost went hospital. 

They're much fit younger. boy treated hospital day collapsed home morning, following weightlifting subsequently transferred National University Hospital (NUH), critical condition intensive care unit. Hahaha Herd immunity via vaccine fine. Herd immunity letting people catch virus extremely risky, dangerous, costly, could serious long term implications involved. silly unnecessary. vaccines masks. Right Yes, um... fuck failed all! opinion, think Tampa right now? *whoosh* heard “a lot horror stories,” makes suspect wasn’t afraid short term side effects long term ones. probably one people didn’t trust vaccine safe. Personally I’ve heard “horror stories” short term effects vaccine, you’ll feel sick day two, every “horror story” I’ve heard it’s apparently safe comes conspiracy theorists others tended take seriously (if know mean, without getting political). know someone thinks millions died vaccine. Yes, somehow millions died. vaccine. Oh ok thanks. Absolutely. personally volunteered knowing would taking risk health part trial never told could end 8 9 months vaccine official status family friends volunteer approved vaccines travel etc. possibility ""unvaccinated"" people let countries repeated testing even brought expensive us pay it. Translation: Delta variant dominant Israel lived Iowa took family vacation St Louis loved it! Must admit little surprised fun things do: great zoo, arch, City Museum, children's museum, fun parks. Two years later set move east coast asked kids particular place Midwest would like visit moved said St. Louis, took another vacation there! City Museum one kind recommend everyone! live Delhi. bore brunt oxygen shortages India. Delhi went first wave 56% population developing antibodies system getting overwhelmed despite 11000 deaths Delhi. delta totally overwhelmed system. antibodies Delhi 80%. refuse believe could overwhelmed without substantial immune escape.  truly never ending 😞 don’t see really problem wearing masks it’s done done

Can ask would consider ""done""? much reason look states entity anymore, clusters unvaccinated people largely regional, specifically rural areas. Florida whole look alright, though statewide number pushed urban centers Central South Florida. panhandle less representative statewide number shares country level vaccination rates southern regions Georgia, Alabama Mississippi. region considerable risk outbreak, similar Southern Missouri/Northern Arkansas, North Texas/Eastern New Mexico. live one states. governor secretary health trying desperately get people vaccinated. They’ve held lotteries, opened clinics sporting events, held mobile clinics, etc. It’s really frustrating look around community know less half people vaccinated, small percentage people wearing masks. Good hear symptoms mild. coworkers vaxed?

All age, BMI, drinking data simular 5hanks info. fully vaccinated optional wear mask

and actually believe vaccinated? Thanks Facebook page found several people work anti vaccers Time. UK's second doses recent. Wow, bad? Italy healthcare run regional governments region set website (which massively wasteful imo oh well), least region registering super easy. took like 2 minutes.

And like Italian PA world-renouned efficiency lol Headline writing 101: Change ""I might"" ""you should"". Vaccinated folks may still carry virus possibly infect others. work hospital asked keep wearing masks public life moreso others encountered side effects within 8 hours vaccine even wanted possible able to. typically worried cold? that’s likely fully vaccinated. seems production problems approval subject deliver promised doses, seem weird. 

In eyes, stupid. Health never linked restrictions commercialization possibilities. would like participate trial subjected idiotic policies? Well vaccinated 1 day state, issue Congrats. cried 1st dose cried even wife got days later. wife got Pfizer May sick covid now. I'm sure that's sign weakening vaccine fact Missouri's vaccinated rate low. mean close open close open good process use vaccines permanent solution  well... 3rd world countries, they'd rather vaccine nothing all. Keep mind I’m US breakthrough serious infections we’ve seen almost exclusively extremely elderly individuals co-existing conditions. article confirm that, I’m guessing it’s case 17 individuals. Shame 4% fucking loud mean... low compared could be. compared US states. Sad

Texas lower this. Dallas lower this. Hold butts. Sturgis 2021 starts one month, going boon delta variant. ""picked"" talking infinite Pfizer doses go around nothing worry then. reassure others, belong risk group barely felt anything doses. Slightly tired 8h first shot.

Shit. good. mean we're back square one still really demoralizing means herd immunity possible. gonna stuck quite covid cases even high vaccination. 

What really bothers impact faith vaccine. lots people start testing positive even becoming sick vaccination, could harder get get take vaccines future (either updated covid vaccines ones). minimal side effects get symptoms caring 9 year old covid. works. doctors told to, shouldn't. Pretty much except losing taste smell months happen flu. 

Not uncommon fully vaxed (Pfizer Moderna) HCW wife's hospital getting covid19 like mild flu (out days) seems losing smell taste months still occuring. simply follow studies. ""Symptomatic disease"" means pretty much nothing. cough 2 days ""symptomatic disease"", yet completely harmless. I'd suggest reading way round: ""non-symtomatic infection"" means protected *so well* vaccine even *notice* infected. There's lot space something severe happening you. 

For reason, thread title bad. whole *reason* ever cared COVID19 *at all* *severe effects* sometimes. goal ending pandemic situation cull severe effects. effects really matter. Stay strong. Infection numbers depends many tests done. UK test five times per capita. 


As excess deaths check:  


Russia reported 57000 covid deaths 2020, meanwhile excess deaths 362000 Ignorant, stupid, easily manipulated dodgy statisics. 

Andrew Wakefield's legacy remains strong :/ Dying quite bad side effect getting vaccine though. 12000 horribly low, China testing millions days (batch testing) outbreak Guandong.

Oof. know reliable source is: here's says: vaccine get, won’t reach full protection two weeks second final dose. That’s long takes immune system mount antibody response vaccine. Cases Chile dropping past weeks. Unlike UK Israel. Lol. everyone vaccinated, 100% hospitalizations vaccinated people.

Be careful keep mind interpreting numbers like this. : understand words make sense end like swine flu. initial reply bit misleading
Moderna AZ Pfizer vs. Delta 1 dose  higher. Overwhelm means people hospitals. mean vaccinated ones hospitals (mostly) mean vaccinated spreading disease. Well, many cases actually result somebody getting noticeably sick, let alone ending hospital?  Good, that’s quicker U.S. seems quite people sub think restrictions, masks etc go forever, neverending attempt chase covid zero. Yes, infectious, make deadly.

Alfa pretty strong variant. antibodies Alfa + vaccinated population good enough deter delta.

Look Europe Rn, look Uk, Look Portugal.

We striken Alfa hard, rn calm despite delta cases adding up.

Since based real world data population majority adults vaccinated (especially 50+ prone mild breakthrough infections), would assume right? Especially since many studies efficacy rate propped good results younger populations, don’t really fall vaccinated group here, also larger unvaxed group proper study would run Peer pressure.

Oh now.. anyway Duchess Cambridge self-isolating coming contact someone since tested positive Covid-19, spokesperson Kensington Palace told CNN Monday. 
 
""Her Royal Highness experiencing symptoms, following relevant government guidelines self-isolating home,"" spokesperson said.

Kate attend Monday's engagements, spokesperson added. alerted Friday afternoon began isolating then.

UK government guidelines stipulate anyone close contact infected person must isolate 10 days.

A royal source told CNN duchess took lateral flow tests engagements last week Euro 2020 soccer tournament Wimbledon, negative. also followed rules throughout Wimbledon mask-wearing, royal source added.

The source said **duchess tested Covid-19 twice week lateral flow tests, line royal household's testing system.** 

**She also received doses Covid-19 vaccine**, source added. People downvoting would make untrue highly vaccinated countries, people reporting cases now, hospitalizations deaths, already tells we're going repeat 2020, reported normal flu numbers like covid cases, it'd enough scare anyone. Mortality longer right thing look UK - successful risk-based vaccine roll means low numbers people perish. fact deaths low anti vax clarion call “*with* covid, *of* covid!” might actually something. 

Real danger spamming health service young middle aged under-vaccinated over-fed patients. Even sufficient vaccine cover population whole inpatient (especially) intensive care rates probably manageable it’ll get better vaccine drive completes. 

Covid sequelae also thing. Full recovery take weeks, even months. Lots healthy years life lost. wonder psychological benefits able stuff help long covid rates. standard test often?

I imagine conspiracy theorists adopting quickly refer health-guidelines-following general populace. whole load people UK infected double vaccinations. Many assumed hayfever, mild illness been.

Yes, imagine hospitals limited isolation-capable wards adequate ventilation infectious respiratory diseases -- especially terrible pandemic like this. Also, particularly pandemic, doctors may minimally involved patients except procedures like intubation required (for ventilators), sickest patients. 

Usually, health care workers (nurses, techs/aides, etc...) contact patients overall many poorer protective equipment, less training use susceptible disinformation Covid, immunization, etc..., see many doctors dying like ""canary coal mine"" sort thing. stay inside? cannot expect population country continue complying restrictions lives basically taken them.

Come back tomorrow, we'll even closer Thanks. study perfectly highlights gripe I've months. 15 months pandemic still know precise viral load necessary increasing case numbers proportion sequencing-confirmed B.1.617.2 cases, coupled wider availability International Standards Reference Panels standardise NAbTs across laboratories, expect improved vaccine efficacy estimates allow precise modelling correlates protection coming months.

We results variants months ago. lame. National pride definitely exists among right political spectrum, US, section population likely antivax (although nowhere near are, despite simplistic narratives hear online).

Could explain post way relevant OP's question? ""Doomist mentality""..unless...you prove vaccines 100% effective. yet see anywhere quite opposite.

See doomist mentality, cuz vaccine ever 100 effective, impossible, cdc goign current data have, new study doenst even review published yet, emotional something neither use subject matter experts on, Id rather wait cdc actual peer data published know. Enough ""lag"" increase cases going exponentially weeks now, lag sure unrefined data. pointed IIRC excess death one forensic tools use estimate disasters magnitude. there's thing much information. weigh assign relative credibility trick. new way display information adds puzzle. deaths lagged then, back december increase similar one now, much less death. 

even increase, doubt would much december. Maybe dangerous cool stay mom's basement long want. Whenever ready. Also think vaccines available still Politically choice every since promised Freedom Day June.

Well compared Australia UK much better space. hospitalization rate focus on. long remains low, wont overwhelm system.

Tokyo, July 5 (CNA) Japan confirm next two days number additional COVID-19 vaccine doses donate Taiwan later month delivered, Taiwan's representative Japan Frank Hsieh (謝長廷) said Monday.

It second batch AZ vaccines donated Japan Taiwan first shipment 1.24 million vaccine doses brand sent Taiwan June 4.

Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said June 25 Japan made second donation Taiwan 1 million COVID-19 vaccines delivered mid-July.

Taiwan signed contracts purchase 20 million vaccine doses abroad, including 5.05 million doses Moderna, 10 million doses AZ, 4.76 million unspecified brands international COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme.

To date, Taiwan taken delivery three shipments AstraZeneca vaccine -- 117,000 doses purchased directly AZ March, 199,200 doses obtained COVAX April, another 410,400 doses obtained via COVAX May 19 -- addition 1.24 million AZ vaccine doses Japan.

It also received 800,000 doses Moderna vaccine doses ordered another 2.5 million Moderna doses donation United States.

100% worth it. comparisons flu specious, [Chris made comparison regarding balanced endgame i.e. live COVID-19 flu. edit - getting flamewar regarding whether decision correct not. I'm referring context whether Israel reimposes suppression measures. Israel unlikely wait see many people get sick without anything further. They've already recommended indoor masking looking interventions, article describes. level suppression measures compounding variable calculated efficacy. never simply put case numbers side-by-side. number people US would never get Covid test even sypmtoms huge, entire force pandemic (with exception hospital admissions deaths) still likely massively underreported US. 

The situation Central Western Europe far different that. number people unwilling/unable get tested much lower.

Once whole thing over, statisticians dig way hosptialisation numerbs, etc., work way backwards calculate high actual case numbers country really were.

I wish similar study testing vaccines vs. variants US. curious Moderna J&amp;J. Moderna Pfizer lot similarities Moderna 3x active ingredient longer dosing window.

Fingers crossed jab 2 Part Johnson's press conference today say Foreign Office Minister make announcement travel week's time. widely expected say double vaccinated people UK travel amber countries without quarantining afterwards. need agreement American end. Yeah like whole world tackling climate change.

Oh wait. I’m getting tired clickbait headlines delta. say it’s less deadly transmissible, I’m hearing deadly transmissible. I’ve heard children unvaccinated vulnerable children hospitalized, data doesn’t support it. I’d like facts truthful information. I’m tired flip flopping. Sure. People 80 are, according studies, likely get hospitalized unvaccinated 50 year old. human body still get sick certain point. Takes time, difference minor.

It's mostly things like making required military.

Realistically, chance thing happening society evolves perspective - realize that, too, want make case hopefully convince others. over? least six. get current state FMCO, go restaurants play sports probably till august   explain twice today. lack understanding even simplest maths statistics depressing.  
I resorted simplifying „With 100% vaccination rate people die Covid-19 vaccinated before.“ Israel, far know, vaccinated 3 weeks doses. (Like US.) UK Canada spaced doses apart, prioritizing first doses second dose. wondering longer spacing confers different level immunity, resulting higher efficacy reported UK vs. Israel Delta specifically. 
 
That would explain relative decline Israel experienced respect Israel. 
 waning immunity time, since Israel's population fully vaccinated UK even started second doses, i.e. UK's antibodies recent. 
 
Could be, weeks make difference, unless soft threshold level. 
There seem several soft thresholds, infecting others, symptoms hard hospital cases. 
However, one would expect soft thresholds impact summer solstice esp arrival autumn, right summer solstice.    Nope.. that's works. get sick cold? meet people do? Cause means 90% get sick pretty much asymptomatic worst mild sickness (if immunocompromised). going stop living life might get cough? No. Chance death 0% immunocompromised... reason fully vaccinated person wear mask even party 100 unvaccinated people. one that's gonna get sick. are. Also say ""but spread it"" can't. get low viral dose spread it'll even smaller... amount used make vaccines 10+ years ago smaller... worry people.  Australia's pretty bad vaccine rollout. know *that* bad though... long prevents hospitalization death, it‘s good vaccine. Pfizer said would take 100 days development distribution need variant booster. trials much quicker since already framework vaccine proven safe. Much like flu shot updated year short trials. think you’re expecting things way pre-pandemic, you’re setting disappointment… part pandemic happened taking threat one seriously enough, despite years warnings experts gone pandemic 100 years ago. 

Returning would irresponsible- say can’t make things good again, “normal”  mean, something realistically plan paid time off. sick day after, work childcare duties. That's question could put authors MedRxiv server. There's comment box abstract. much people love talk risk sub, seem sense variability person person, place place, beyond binary “safe” “dangerous.” Sweet unattainable prepared sick second dose lot people knew were, besides feeling little tired, fine.

Nah sterilized canned milk. way Im looking it, close risk long covid/50 person event par needing medical attention car accident per trip.

Can clarify means? every 50 people COVID chance one developing Long COVID par chance needing medical attention accident? misunderstanding? 😂😂😂 She’s nice lady industrious. however pig fart. anxiety common amongst people live antivax family. I've seen similar feelings expressed /r/qanoncasualties. worth, everyone friend group family gotten vaccine months ago one regrets it. okay get it. heart rate increased right now, could literally anxiety. That’s good one. LOL.  Significant amounts haven’t suffered dangerous complications. You’re making shit up. article particular isn’t great, media reporting delta virus isn’t “fear-mongering.” anything past year, people wrong keep assuring everyone everything fine, see things get worse. pandemic kicked ass. information good. don’t need patted head told everything fine.   That's immune system. Imagine organs ravished Covid.. Same. side effect napping movie. Nah I'm good. would vaccinate first, got doses got any?

That's kind world works.

Same country giving citizens doses billions 0. there's evidence third shot beneficial becomes available, country able get citizens regardless unvaccinated billions poor countries. Yup. too. left comment China lying Covid deaths downvoted removed mods claiming harassment. 

Every negative comment China downvoted. already mine well. study? posted Facebook. I’m 100% positive I’ll get hate comments stupid Americans yelling me. Low efficacy also side effects examples long term effects vaccines?

Yes. dying whatever vaccinated against. Yeah, like what’s that? imagine, student nurses, many probably wearing masks. point, I’m surprised requirement Apparently, test results (positive) another (negative) person switched. told he's negative went fun, get call next day he's fact positive.

Bad situation. Bad mistake test center. hope spread much Delta variant.

Luckily, appears rare. That’s shame. Personally think it’s wiser fear covid fearing vaccine. 160 million odd folks fully vaccinated there’s serious issue less 1% people. 
Covid however there’s roughly 33.7 million cases covid resulting 605k dead. Seems like you’re risk adverse you’d get vaccine.  Way less chance death. Lol takedown think bro. 

""I acknowledge getting vaccinated right thing do, I'm waaaaay fucking selfish paranoid it.""  general, never hard training vaccination hard training temporarily waken immune system. want immune system freaking minuscule amount expensive foreign protein, don’t want sitting dead tired corner hitting gym.  

Same goes viral infections - influenca, measles cold, want careful week after. Myocarditis quite regular complication common, athletes Covid-19. privileged life person must have. mutations far less deadly original? Yes, Personal critera worry varies. never worried work around people flu, worry now. first line get yearly flu vacine despised around sick people constantly washed hands, worried. us fell somewhere flu slightly wary fairly worried. one person says yes another depends level risk, tolerance discomfort define wary enough considered worried. Definitely, tied mask mandates vaccination % community create incentive.  Probably immunity vaccine starts weaning like likely catch COVID-19 longer gap reinfections  likely end approaching 90% vaccinated 

I suspect younger people positive sentiment towards older people getting vaccinated can’t bothered 

I doubt get 96% adults vaccinated would nice though news? ""Look dumb person died was!"" hate this.

It may US border opens without anyone needing vaccinated, case matter. maybe they'll persuaded accept AZ. sure say ""hardly anyone wearing masks"" describe Indonesian population whole. look downtown Jakarta area (which am), shopping malls, office buildings main roads, almost everyone wears mask. look traditional markets, rural areas smaller cities, hard say. I've seen tweets people complaining almost one area wearing masks.

Today Indonesia recorded 29,745 new cases. Almost 11,000 Jakarta. think mostly big cities, really hard tell since believe general, things severely under-reported. people exhibiting symptoms might might covid allowed tested family. Like said above, lack trust health system. past week, even people actually covid want treated hospital, almost every hospital already full brim covid patients. Yeah, cake lover makes sense! haha dying, slowing rise cases protecting weaker immune response. Yes, it’s fine work day get vaccinated, feel it. 

Remember fullest protection comes two weeks finished vaccine series, one shot two, continue taking precautions then. CureVac know vaccinated? plenty cases vaccinated people testing positive. example NC State baseball team forfeit vaccinated players tested positive. 
but forgot..it agree narrative stupid Florida people. I’m paramedic, every EMT paramedic know vaccinated. ones haven’t don’t want it. Lol, maybe it’s low cost little inconvenience massively anti-social people, come on, you’re vaccinated, better chance getting hit lightning dying COVID. mention vaccinated articles I've seen. Meanwhile, twitter, Florida fire departments posting photos claiming assisting vaccination. None Jacksonville. 4～6 hours 1~2 hours after, got . think manage that. Thank help! yet CDC claims vaccinated people ""safe"" covid, need take additional precautions, nothing worry about. Sigh. people feel emotionally react conscious action. really choice. reason attach moral stigma it. chances still high getting COVID, especially Delta variant. Israel, highest vaccination rates World, fully-vaccinated died COVID Delta variant unvaccinated. 

Here's poor child died getting vaccine: Thank much！ I’m curious think reason every virus hasn’t already supermutated way kills massive portions population No, assholes need violence make react better tragedy. 


You literally spent time say ""asshole asshole things"". Many fully vaccinated deaths already, although media tends ignore deaths, I'm sure warning public. I'm horrified saddened 13-year old died getting COVID shot last week. AstraZeneca vaccine one I've heard causing clots rarely. wary information consume, agree. article leave part all.  Moderna != Pfizer

Just use mRNA make same. another vaccine used mRNA horrible efficacy recently name slips mind. that's AZ? even covid vaccines? even administer AZ US think Masks social distancing provide high extra layer security low cost little inconvenience. There's compelling argument drop measures. ""People tired it"" good argument. Politicians lead, wait see people running towards follow them. 99%?  give us real numbers rather percentages?  details, underlying health conditions?  lack information really pathetic... think blindly believe them? seems included asymptomatic infections really drop. UK study showed 88% focused symptomatic illness. people 1 million 1 million UK.

If birth control, know cause clots unrelated things, needs speak doctor regardless, thing I'm expert Google-fu. clinical trials conducted allowing people take NSAIDs like ibuprofen felt needed Pfizer Moderna efficacy rate still really really high (source: ) 

So think need make needlessly suffer Comforting unless you’re pool high risk people suppose. Yup ..same done (mRNA booster) AZ non mRNA vaccines lower efficacy especially VoCs That's I'm talking about! lot people avoided Moderna side effects numbers speak themselves. fuck sterilized milk promote immunity? know I'd love know warped thought process brought exist “Decided COVID over”.

Reddit. /roll eyes.

My assumption You’re making entire thing up. relatives vaccinated? planning engage indoor dining? kids going inside places without masks? need answers trip. July comparable time seasons etc. understand considerable impact Covid. Last year drastically lower yet 12 months seem vaccinations I'm surprised increase. I'm glad deaths I'm confused: Delta Variant **that** much infectious increased testing factor? know convincing someone anti-vax total waste time still feel obligated try friend mine. thinks birth control, vaccine cause blood clots. anyone statistics least lay see helps? yet read scientific paper claims ‘herd immunity’ Covid-19 exists. people given vaccines cities denied them. full access. hands antivaxxers Covid deniers. Sweden's health authority made decision power so. government work identically countries Covid lockdowns handling political issue way countries. also pressure Swedish ground law freedom movement changed without calling election.

The sad fact Sweden caught fully unprepared pandemic politically, legally arrogance health authority. Part even wonders wanted virus rip us ease burden pensioners health service housing crisis. honestly amazed worse vaccines finally available ages now. oh delta trelta sigma variant D: I'm pretty sure did. also every point January 20th particularly worst points pandemic Remember masks don’t protect wearer. prevent wearer spreading germs Isn’t COVID basically equivalently dangerous 12 crowd flu? far life concerned, final vestige pandemic that's left mask mandate flights. Confirmed reinfections arent done PCR tests, it’s done genetic sequencing viruses compared. think ladt bit true. small minority &lt;5% we're close even estimating unreported cases. wish would random sampling back peaks see true spread. Thanks correcting me, stand corrected. 

My point France come long way initial 40% uptake surveys early year. Ireland high uptake, surprise. wrote article local paper Feb describing following public health civic duty. lot conservatives offended/mad me. lot. Yup that’s added plus. Didnt even think 18+ high. area low vaccination rates definitely would, chances breakthrough infection would greater least attempt good example others. Fortunately, 75% adults state fully vaccinated Delta variant issue here, feel perfectly safe without mask. I've lived life totally normally past weeks feels amazing. Masks still around. difference is, people actually choice whether feel need mask instead government imposing them, since deaths hospitalizations plunged adults (especially high risk demos) vaccinated.

People actually deciding themselves, novel concept, right? ""See! told pandemic would end even get shot.""
- Every unvaccinated person know Almost senate insanely undemocratic thinking recently regarding stats. guess really start seeing vaccine effects death counts middle late summer, 5 6-week window uptake across millions people got shots spring takes effect. Perhaps June tad early legitimately claim 99% died chose get vaccine, time August/September would make sense. CDC full-vax daily count factor 2-week waiting period 2nd dose? Much history 1918 pandemic seems like could written last week. eerie, bit depressing advanced farther century.

I found interesting many public health recommendations heard beginning current epidemic actually went back anti-tuberculosis measures end 19th century. Hopefully, one things comes current pandemic end droplet theory, rise understanding aerosol transmission. accomplishment right. Wasn’t report Israel saying Pfizer vaccine less effective delta? Would cause problem here? quite likely get even quite likely recover even don't, like said, fear dying. least die dignity. You’re allowed wear rest life, one stopping you. times, PCR-test. mean tests like T-Detect detect person vaccinated mRNA vaccine past? actually wasn’t hard. got appointment got offered rapid test. Maybe got lucky. actually confirmed reinfection Sure.. 14 days.. 

I AZ first moderna shy 8 weeks apart. messaging CDC messed care anymore.

CDC already clearly stated vaccinated people longer need masks, longer wear mask anywhere, even work. enter Uk quarantine day 2/8 tests? tough time getting rapid test? dealing think allergies wanted get tested since young kids give rapid thought longer test defeated purpose kids.. today 86.1% adults first dose. pass 90% soon. similar Netherlands. According polls, 94% Dutch adults intend get vaccination, 6% darn loud social media. think much US built around automobile following WW2. drive place sit outside? Plus lot small towns could great outdoor sitting migrated economy away downtown towards interstates/highways pick drivers. get mega box stores, large parking lots etc downtown dies lack foot traffic.


Plus quite bit country pretty crappy weather considerable time year time unvaccinated people susceptible repeat infections especially variant virile? Think find *science* backs up. 


I'm vaccinated now, doses, still get infected expect anywhere near harsh symptoms before. enjoy getting covid Part hesitancy likely people living remote areas touched much COVID. Canada, fairly common. People affected virus much lockdowns etc since numbers low immediate vicinity, AU's case country whole, they're bitter govt (more bitter types already were).

Australia also slow rollout though hesitancy. They're going age among factors, right adults aged 40-49 get vaccine people 18-39 choose get AZ.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* better nothing. Rural MN basically South Dakota. That's government wants think! I'm Mississippi, ... know. That's choice make, assuming they're vaccinated area mandate it. I'm choosing myself.  like Bangladesh T. know what's sad? coward without dignity whatever tyrannical governments say get called ""freedoms"" back. edited post found one:  literally saying thing here. know, people, disproportionately either unharmed even benefit lockdown restrictions, eager impose preference rest population?  interesting look into. Thanks sharing!  did. Thanks response.  waaaaay bottom. article news round-up happens include headline. covid situation Hawaii? Even definitely wearing mask, least flu season. Pandemic aside, getting cold flu past winter amazing. Yeah. got rapid test. I’ll getting results back soon. Ig thts natural selections works Yeah true, UK covid deaths 98% peak, let's keep restrictions place covid zero. Like avoiding covid all.

In fact, thousands people die car collisions every year, let's strip right drive drivers unless trip life death situation. all, going road putting others risk.

We surrender notion privacy personal freedoms name safety, sounds like magnificent idea.  Sorry, don't. Papers referenced r/COVID19 though. fact think evidence delay Pfizer available first AZ. Unfortunately spreads... it'll eventually everywhere.

Here Canada, one worst outbreaks country right Yukon. Figure one out.  There’s documented cases fully vaccinated people dying Covid. Anecdotes don’t give us full picture. driven data science, anecdotes.

Natural immunity comparable vaccines. see phase 3 trial data Moderna Pfizer, see Lancet study, see meta analysis Israels data. doesn’t mean can’t get shouldn’t get vaccinated means percentage won’t get vaccinated protection anyway.  Yes, someone could said statement point past. former US president could said April, deaths cases climbing rapidly, would still technically true time. Yeah I'm talking non-mask wearing, non-vaccinated people. know 3 people (we'll call morons) category gotten covid 2 3 times. ridiculous. time they're like ""it's even bad"" realizing them, people infect on.....  sub really gone shit.  getting numbers? Canada listed 68 percent total population 78 eligible (12+) first vaccinated part. 16 year olds dont cardiac arrest working much lmao little reminder children 12 still can't get vaccinated. way .1% population deserve protection teen, get Pfizer Canada, really wished would approved Moderna us now, since large surplus province. I've already gotten shots whatever. Eh, forever forever, like much helped allergies seasonal colds. I'll probably wear whenever there's something going around heavy pollen mold. Besides, mask. here's we're still mess, thinking! Pandemics end. pandemic ends point future, constantly closer ever end.

Isn't title says? otc test binanxnow shows positive covid, definitely covid.

They tend miss asymptomatic people. really take  Government let go measures, including facemasks: nobody’s wearing them. follow? can’t tell statement satirical not, sad Luckily employer will, lost last job covid cutbacks I'm really leery now. isnt complete list means starters:

- Dramatic worldwide lowering child mortality rates.

- Elimination hunger majority world.

- end feudalism serfdom.

- Massive worldwide reduction number hours per week dedicated housework.

- Dramatic reduction wars violence society general.

- Huge medical improvements, including vaccinations, resulting massive numbers lives saved life expentancy significantly increasing.

- Massive improvements communication technology.

- Increase years spent school world wide. true girls well boys. Literacy normal.

- Weekends exist. Shortening duration produces poorer immune response. Pretty solid evidence Pfizer AZ. 8 weeks really minimum - 12, even 20, better. documented cases people getting infected three times. relative works nurse saw many staff members get covid twice, 6 months apart last year. Two weeks past second Pfizer prior infection tested positive. zero symptoms. 

You trigger PCR even you’re contagious don’t active infection reddit.  Yes that’s time works fact, doesn’t change fact vaccination high likelihood protection severe disease even infected. mean 'impossibly' literally, substitute 'extremely'.

It impossible statement 'US closer ever pend pandemic' incorrect, matter statement made. Assuming pandemic ends point future, constantly closer ever end.  Probably intense outbreaks certain regions. Delta eventually spread everywhere.

The debate countries right reopening need get vaccinations done numbers. debate irrelevant US, US already hit saturation point vaccinations. vaccines available months anybody already either a) refusing b) 12 years old c) unable take legit medical reason (very small number people, one notable group would people chemo think).

So US... point kinda gotta let ride. people vaccines available choose take them, well, do? still overwhelm health authorities areas fucking sucks really option trying drive vaccination adoption (which states care already/are already doing) making vaccines mandatory going happen.  californian variant appeared strong evasion rate towards vaccines luckily enough Delta overtook it. happened week ago. Good joke. 

I'm company actually offers ""good"" benefits US. five weeks paid vacation, take 5 sick days one year I'm risk fired.

Oh, last year caught covid, doctor-ordered FMLA leave denied return work (remotely fortunately) blood oxygen count still low 90s.  work US. work policy Covid stay home, work remotely possible (and approved). unable (or approved), use sick leave vacation time come back. both, get paid. 

If use sick vacation Covid, cannot take either leave type rest year (unless unpaid approved).

Capitalism baby! Also 10% population infected (~1m people). 


Gonna interesting see post-Covid thing works out, know 18- 29-years olds well 6 months infection What? Delta content pops regularly r/news r/worldnews r/covid19. Difference place people posting articles rehashing findings obscure sources. Well 95% rate Pfizer/moderna chance symptoms. hospitalization. zero-covid strategy countries vaccine focused countries seeing surges result Delta variant now. Literally neither going work anymore. need high vaccination rates masking contact tracing quarantining needed successful point. much transmissible now, stakes higher. That’s sad, another life taken particular side news media  late least live that's case, cares people want go that? obviously free Covid. I’m sure legal case least filing HR complaint would support lawsuit Boris right saying “If now, when?” We’ve done well vaccination programme third wave inevitable, seems be, it’s better get worst way summer winter comes ease strain NHS. However, mood decidedly muted considering we’re lifting most, all, restrictions July 19. agree it, even think maybe sooner July 19, feel scary hurtling toward 100,000 cases day reopening country. I’ll wearing mask third wave peaks, regardless government says. I’m happy we’re making plans vaccinate 18s. feels quite weird. It’s relief also like you’re constantly looking shoulder, dreading could happen next. can't stand Boris tedious watching people try brute force Trump comparisons onto him. Trump dumb rock staggeringly insecure, mention far right politically (as American politics general). Boris far like Biden, would considered liberal conservative UK. reports indicating Delta variant spreading rapidly among vaccinated people.

Please post links this. Approval cannot come soon enough.

Since older, time tested vaccine type, going huge scared mRNA. can't really play ""wait see many people get infected anything"" that's contrary basic conception public health.

??? course can. That's exactly first tested efficacy vaccines. point *mass* scale agree. That, however, necessary complete study.  yeah, sounds scary get mild symptoms where’s issue?  It’s great, I’m curious. English isn’t primary language Indonesia, translation keep rhyme? Let alone structure. French wouldn’t work word play like this, think. Increasing cases UK, hospitalization deaths remain flat, seemingly relationship cases deaths broken, suggesting vaccines jobs. think we'll alright. Lol, America's fault! ethnic religious though. pseudo-Libertarian movement among New Age types, mainly white Anglo-Saxon Boomer generation types. know several, unfortunately. According multiple studies, around 30% people get COVID develop long haul symptoms regardless whether require hospitalization not. people, 1/3 COVID symptoms sick.

From data speculate getting COVID, even mild breakthrough case, carries 10-30% risk long haul issues. Ah A'damnit source that? I’m sure like phrase “valid opinion”, though noting un- misinformed opinion whole point online debate, one primary purposes Reddit I'm assuming Delta variant. I'm Vermont, vaccinated, still masking. data coming Israel bode well, I'm throw health away CDC gets around echoing WHO's advice four weeks late. problem taking mask restaurant, date, hanging friends

But would you? According logic, wear ""absolutely harm"". seem pulling ass Looks like delta run wild under. :( confirm this. work, Fully Moderna vaccinated woman mid 40s contracted Delta variant. 
Symptoms bad head cold mild flu. wants end severe cases still remain low even big spike cases.They delay see results looks like vaccines broke link.

All science saying let people get 2nd dose. soon. correct, measures literally stop NHS getting overwhelmed. anymore, measures.

Don't worry still wear mask absolutely everywhere go. tried, although much doubt much effect national level. National pride practically non-existent outside international sports. Possibly among elderly recalled wartime etc. Sorry see fully vaccinated guidance via link, I’m looking non-vaccinated guidance 🙂  epidemiologist critical Indonesian government day one imposing harsh lockdowns. Indonesian government insistent so.

Secondly, epidemiologist made wild projections [last year least50,000 250,000 dead end Indonesia decentralized 20 years. epidemiologist till thinks central government step take over. can't. Almost hospitals control regional governments.

Some regional government handled better others, necessarily money.

The capital, Jakarta, 9000 cases day positivity 25-30%. Surabaya second largest city, Surabaya, 3 Million, population 1/3 Jakarta, 60 cases per day positivity rate 1-2% Jakarta prior surge positivity rate 5-10%, Surabaya 1%. Last year, Surabaya experience serious surge heath care system collapsed, refused lockdowns like Jakarta. focused testing, contract tracing. micro lockdowns. Surabaya time managed boast contact tracing 1:3 last year 1:40 today

However, Surabaya hospitals still overrun today, cases flooding rest province East Java. 70% Covid 19 cases people living outside Surabaya..

Lastly Indonesian government stupid so? Even last year Indonesia relatively light social restrictions. done neighbors done, exhausted process, Many Indonesian government officials scared social unrest hard lockdowns bring people dying covid-19. Westerners might take pity time mock Indonesian government, financial markets don't, go right jugular like 1998.

.  Seems like things pretty back normal, no? big argument going forward probably much change lives stop COVID number severe cases reduced.

Israel's initial success seemed create hope vaccination could simply create herd immunity, though still open question exactly evasive Delta really is, clear spreads easily. Vaccinating children might create herd immunity Delta, last variant, nature thing seems keep spreading everyone catches least once.

So herd immunity seems unlikely, question much want keep R0 1, along questions whether mild/asymptomatic cases (like kids mostly get) long-term health consequences (I think so, would hard prove new virus).

I'm camp believes imposed restrictions virus behaves way COVID highly-vaccinated populations, undoubtedly true still enough serious cases create serious outbreaks. No. said, law protect others, like protects children abuse neglect. mean law infatilize adults.  including Florida. think take, least, another somewhat sizeable outbreak get vax rate floor again. That's called irony lol.

I know several people reason whatsoever get shot (even account) basically think too. like think getting away something, proving point. And, think comes back time get vaxxed anyway. 64% India allowed gathering 1 million mainly unvaccinated folks April largest super spreader event world... Dude I'm already sick fucking Delta variant shit. case counts high vaccinated state start exponentially accelerating ill afraid right there's lot talk barely blips radar  Oh gosh, got reminiscing first jab. made us queue outside rain, one people brought umbrella. Damn satisfying. 

Rain, drudgery, sense smug superiority, queue... rolled one! know many deaths UK today? 9. really think people right throw babies, toddlers, kids cars without seatbelts safety seats?

Wow kinda freedumb would cost millions kids lives cause lifelong disabilities. getting downvoted correct. gave year lives, isn’t March 2020 anymore. you’re vaccinated, live life. masks. ""loss taste smell"" longer high symptoms also acting differently now,” […] “It’s like bad cold younger population people don’t realize hasn’t come across government start May, looking top symptoms app users were,” said. “The number one symptom headache, followed sore throat, runny nose fever.” “traditional” Covid symptoms cough loss smell much rarer said, younger people experiencing much bad cold “funny feeling.” Here's example herd stupidity! guys even scaled testing? 😂 Yes, sorry, think pasted wrong link (again, seem penchant that). others subs pointed out, Delta would thousands times transmissible suddenly capable this. narrative specific variants creating new threat nonsense. agree you. believe unvaccinated need wearing masks whenever indoors public setting. legitimate health reasons getting vaccine, probably avoiding public places foreseeable future (since you’re concerned health course). 

“You” intended literal comment. It’s directed solely anti-vaxx/anti-maskers. know projection, total births/deaths data Russia April 2021, calculated excess mortality ~500k according worst possible estimates. Yet website shows 700k April 30. know estimate it, seems somewhat exaggerated. Exactly this. Got vaccinated, lived like monk year, time go life. Spot on. Fully vaccinated still can't come.  Yes good news sever disease hospitalization effectiveness still strong God forbid person allowed time ""think"" lives. lol Apart US live elsewhere  please vaccinate rest world something goes even wrong? We'd come allowed China even 2 deaths last year country population 1.4 billion people, sure… Lockdown prevention hospitals overwhelmed. stopping people ever catching virus.

As explained scientists, opening flatten curve ahead winter.  aren’t vaccines approved permanently US. still approved emergency basis?  data cells play protective role humans. measure blood unclear home initial sites infection like upper lower respiratory tract. likely want mucosal cells need immunize mucosally intramuscularly. 7 billion people earth, little 1% live UK. argument might hold water scale, really driving factor national policy. Even let everyone nation get COVID, drop statistical bucket. COVID care country in. get second pfizer Wednesday, close friend idiot mentality, nothing say change outlook it.  reports indicating Delta variant spreading rapidly among vaccinated people. 

Calling CDC stating false information ""Doomist mentality""..unless...you prove vaccines 100% effective. yet see anywhere quite opposite. 

The protection severe infection fully known numbers seen closer 95%. 

Regardless, many people concerned long haul covid anything else. vaccines shown protect people develop symptomatic infection. Covid long haul become national health crisis. say ""Doomist"" mentality concerned plain stupid. 

You clearly believe high mighty expert talk others know everything Delta variant, even top scientists don't. yet 37 deaths yesterday  I'm loop. papers cfr vaccinated people stratified age? Mild cases unvaccinated people vaccinated people. Vaccines take away long covid problems right get vaccine protects also. there's reason look cases people cold like symptoms less. efficacy goes actually hurts vaccinated individuals show. one care 100% vaccinated people get sick covid asymptomatic/mild symptoms. Silverstone 100% capacity anyway. 

The difference requirement tell people tested negative covid.   I’d agree anti-vaxxers unvaccinated anti-maskers reckless irresponsible, definitely fully vaccinated people don’t wear masks every single scenario anymore. fucking cares, cases mean deaths.

Who cares? People know outcome case complex live/die. plenty bad outcomes even ""mild"" (i.e. hospitalised) cases. actual number 4. 

4 states reached 70% fully vaccinated. Good job everybody! NZ eliminated Alpha outbreak 7 day lockdown February. community case 4 months since then. matter locking fast enough. 

Elimination thing eradication. impossible eradicate virus exists outside borders. Elimination preventing cases Australia NZ tolerating even low numbers. 

The state Australia elimination strategy New South Wales thus coincidence they're big outbreak Delta right now. refused lockdown cases got control. Advice might useful elsewhere using mRNA vaccines younger people.

AVOID STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WEEK VACCINATION

*In separate statement Monday, expert committee said people vaccinated, particularly adolescents and men 30 years old, should avoid exercise strenuous physical activity week dose jab.* 

*This update previous advisory avoid strenuous physical activity week second dose. new advice was made given “emerging data small risk myocarditis pericarditis” observed vaccination mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, said expert* UK hospitalisation fatality rates lower vaccination, delta less dangerous. There's [Lancet suggests hospitalisation rate 85% higher delta alpha. Anyone know find information people U.S. COVID, went get vaccinated? broadly, I'm wondering whether reason people getting vaxx U.S. believe protection infected. articles this? Thank you! know many diseases asymptomatic, even immune still spread sickness. don’t see different those.

They've done studies collected actual data showing vaccine reduces ones ability spread disease ~80%. case numbers try get articles help it. 

If unwilling research, chiming things require information Besides. don’t see really problem wearing masks it’s done done. 

As defined how? There's never going clear ""end,"" period. really need define Wearing masks literally downsides couple small annoyances like making harder hear people, little sweat hot places, maybe bad breath.

Vaccines fewer downsides masks. required first, want require masks. word? Yes. Don’t panic real concern. Keep masking up. Get second shot stop reading absolute shit idiots internet, smh Cases depends number test. Russia lagging behind UK lot. UK tests 5 times much per capita Russia.  


Look daily deaths. UK 1250 daily deaths 6 months ago, 17. 98%. 


In Russia? Last week set time record. Six months ago 560 daily deaths. 660 daily deaths increasing. whole spring 400 daily deaths.  


UK **down 98%**, Russia: **up 20%.** 

(And please let's skip discussion much Russia underreporting Covid deaths.) 


And Vaccination, e.g. 


Pretty scary county approved vaccine august 2020. find kind shit always really hard. lot indonesean people need make money informal sector choiche go street make money epidomolegist devoleping country know political Explanation rates less 5% weeks/months total last year. barely got low enough original recommendations consider opening restaurants public places, they’ve open along (minus weeks beginning). I'm fully vaccinated know whether start worried. reason? according

*The vaccine developed BioNTech SE protected 64% receivers illness June 6 early July government lifted restrictions, 94% May 2 June 5, Ynet news website reported, citing Health Ministry numbers.* 
 
*More importantly, vaccinated remained far less likely hospitalized, protection dropping slightly 93% 98% period. efficacy serious illness similar, according report.* 
 
*The delta variant, first emerged India, sparking concern spreads around globe, providing real-life test vaccines dashing hopes recovery air travel.* I’m vaccinated. watched United States spiral control almost everybody wore mask “stop spread”. saw co-workers wearing masks give each-other work. I’d stay office never made feel safe. run mill cloth masks little.  Well fuck. do?  reporting weekly basis. Portugal, found official document yet situation looks similar british despite less ppl vaxed.

If bad Portugal, numbers death critical patient would copy rise infected far happening. Bear mind, delta  Ah yes, infection surges UK Israel happening speak. Funnily enough, Bahrain Seychelles used ""low-quality"" vaccines see cases dropping, lol.

Another funny thing media quickly switched talking ""preventing hospitalizations deaths"" rather efficacy real world data Israel showed Pfizer 64% efficacy vs Delta variant number dropping week vaccinated people get infected, lol. Yea man it’s mind boggling wonder rakyat can’t seem understand SOPs..everyday change Lah….the govt seems think we’ll back normal end year honest don’t see way current lockdown least another month UK shit jump beastly thing early doors too… yeah, let’s just, know, see Europeans getting along making “rash” decisions and… Oh fuck fucking fuckity fuck it’s here!

I don’t know got 30% figure? concern spike protein? people honestly think travel open UK US? haven’t able see girlfriend since last March 😞 continued ban doesn’t follow science One thing hear Media, official goverment reports saying.

Uk used report nicely last week. Basically population vaccination antibodies previous infection delta variant really Yes Back March 2020 hundred cases lot terrifying. people simply cannot learn mistakes trials others.

Some people trust pot hot people touch it. still worried since mutation chances something serious there. looking good. UK might start letting people two shots end month. home borbs. Bought pet store 😎 definitely challenging. 

I've putting spinach smoothies since taste matter right now. 

Wish best. Yes, simply stupidest thing could done.  Hmm, rather, think it’s privilege care. Well, cure vaccine hesitancy. factories every backyard, people like article reject it. big loss though, people desperate receive Darwin's award. 5b come from. Never trust somebody pays whores pee him... Actions meet consequences. uncommon fully vaxed (Pfizer Moderna)

It's really great idea throw unquantifiable terms like scientific discussion. talking 5% breakthrough cases? 50%? screwed unless many people get vaccinated  Politicians accountable people. People ready return normality. It’s time get back gigs, live sport clubbing Efficacy infection almost certainly function viral load, I'd buy explanation. actually assaulted wearing mask always double edged sword. Mate high vaccination rate low deaths showed current data. Yes masks help I’ve never said didn’t however large portion population vaccinated deaths low others ditch mask risk low. 

As long covid research needed yes it’s low terms population since 65 million people live country. 

I also want point us nearly vulnerable people two doses already getting third booster shot September, much longer others want stay restricted others scared virus low risk.

Again I’ve said always risk whether it’s short long term diseases yet deal accept risks come it. Wow, you’re douche. I’m vaccinated aware. is/was not. still act like human. would not? get sentiment. vaccinated still wear mask grocery store getting haircut. absolutely harm provides incredible benefit, COVID-19 respiratory virus flu well. 

Yes, problem taking mask restaurant, date, hanging friends... would wear crowded grocery stores malls? People aren’t dying decision sensible one. need return normal. Social distancing mask wearing gradually slipping weeks now. Look scenes England won. wasn’t mask site news, water liquid. emphasized lot press conference avoiding double whammy harsh flu season running time COVID. 

In opinion, tough smart decision. overwhelming majority vulnerable double jabbed, getting infections delta variant (and immunity) important people charge decided essentially ""let rip"" population get immunity whilst double jabs try keep deaths down.

This COVID absolutely devastate health system winter. I’m cancun right one said anything curfew 🤷‍♀️ I’m disagreeing also bringing light issues vaccine valid people experiencing Saying think evidence suggests people saying expect people actually do. last year taught us anything people give shit science people. understand feel want know alone.

I got first shot Pfizer early May. Went work night, felt fine next day thought clear. Woke feeling bit weird day two brushed tired. Later day two spells dizziness/nausea noticeably elevated heart rate. Ended ER, got battery tests everything fine. 

Took week day shot heart rate go - woke one day felt completely normal.

I'm worried long-term effects, really think that's issue. I'm concerned experiencing first shot (or worse) gotten second one yet.

10% people small number. You’re talking number hundreds thousands still risk this. don’t want wear mask it’s uncomfortable.

You terrible person.  UK people, smart decision? Update: 10-15% masked indoors. Maybe DSP Tampa itself. Don’t forget! Respiratory Syncytial Virus rise too!!!

[RSV Florida](http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus/index.html) wear mask still want to, socially acceptable others I’m happy get rid mask risks much lower compared were. 

Second terms long covid it’s still small amount people suffer that’s sucks can’t forever stayed masked locked people get ill. 

The risks covid much lower places high vaccination rates showing people contract covid get mild symptoms alongside low deaths. Well hypothesis newspaper article. quite *possibly* true data support conclusion right now. possibilities. That's studies needed. Indonesia. amount misinformation spread social media vast amount people actually believing worldwide phenomenon.  UK generally vaccinated AZ, correct? thought AZ less effective Delta Pfizer, Moderna. Sure, breakthrough infections fully vaccinated overwhelmingly likely mild.

But dismissive risk mild cases Covid-19 makes sense mild case really dangerous common cold, there's evidence significant long term health risks even mild cases Covid-19:

[Is Covid’s Impact Brain Alarming Sounds? Even mild cases cause significant brain changes, research shows, making “living Covid” risky dangerous mild cases Covid led loss volume certain areas brain, specifically involved processing smell taste. also found statistically significant brain volume loss gray matter — thin layer surface brain contains neurons — areas involved memory formation. authors speculate raises possibility even mild cases SARS-Cov-2 infection deleterious effects may last long past period infection.

That’s all. That's focus attacking non-mRNA vaccines trying discredit them. come back bite public health. No, you’re ignoring evidence provided. believe 10% people suffering long covid A-okay risk don’t like masks?

I’m arguing lockdown moron. I’m talking masks. return Canada, sure. said start I'm fine millions dying, reason care life death that's that. 

However millions die, neither 10s thousands young ones left unvaccinated. low risk either even worth thinking about. Yet alone one two jabs top it. 

If going avoidable deaths, well smoking, yearly flu, fat. 

How stop those, permanent lock down, anyone caught smoking imprisoned isolation life. Anyone caught eating daily calorie limit restrained bed force fed rest life case. 


If worried risk wear full face respirator, go permanent isolation home. health responsibility. 

The rest us life's lead frankly sick death hearing oooo better stay away other. zoom call instead meeting up. Yer....fuck that. people saying masking isn’t forever strangely don’t end date mind wonder “anti-maskers” think want mask forever. agree COVID around forever, rest us patient till get 2030 rest world suitably vaccinated? That's first dose, know effective Delta. France around 44% doses adults (34% residents). number 1 Vague often? Qb Masks required indoors obviously everyone going wear them. question Canada UK. Amber zone, mean travel without quarantine provided fully vaccinated? Yes, article suggests variant cause concern. suggest evades vaccine, possible. 

Again, far seen variant evades vaccine meaningful way. We've seen suggested vaccines may provide less protection certain variants, leads back original question, anti-vaxxers seem believe protection better option protection.  Bad bot number 30th June, Bloomberg recent numbers yesterday, increased bit. 

Sweden, Norway Ireland definitely behind, still every day 100K people France getting first dose, number gradually increase.  queue get building, queue get signed appointment, queue talk person asking medical questions, queue person giving vaccine, 15 min wait end essentially another queue.

None queues long, Brit wonderful.  problem Delta indeed milder. St. Louis County hit 49% people first vaccination, rest state, yup, don’t understand methodology puts Australia UK Australians allowed leave country probably won’t 2022? percentage delta, know? really seems something different. vulernable subset population.

Everybody vulnerable, moreso Delta. less vulnerable others. matter amount vulnerability willing tolerate. willing accept full saturation 1/1000 kids may die, higher rate people 18-40? that's what'll happen. people might okay -- understand -- doctors want see system overwhelmed again. point, pretty much accept 1/1000 risk kids get vaccine, reopenings happening not/cannot put pause forever.

We want hit saturation point anything close it. point slightly delay restriction-lifting weeks, 2nd doses going *rapidly* right now. actually looks wholly incorrect, looking new data Canada, Israel, etc. AZ infact better Pfizer.

It correct. I'm Canada, administering AZ anymore one reasons why. recommended maybe month anybody got AZ 1st dose get Pfizer Moderna 2nd dose instead combined regimen effective AZ-AZ (the combo seems almost good Pfizer/Moderna - think numbers 94% 96% hospitalization Stay inside next 400 years want. stopping you.

Nobody even close suggesting that, derail conversation falsely throwing around helpful.

To reiterate: *nobody* suggesting ""stay inside forever"". suggesting lifting restrictions another 2-3 weeks (or even much selectively) much larger proportion country get shots.

The side people need know soon kids eligible vaccines, need get vaccinated IMMEDIATELY real risk them, even 1/1000. getting data? [OWID currently France behind EU albeit data France bit stale.

France anyhow still 5-10%pts behind Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, etc. Unless I'm mistaken, France dead last Western Europe. hope cities states keep this. It’s enjoyable able sit outside things begun recover 36 percent vaccinated people still getting sick. That's math works. that's still want wear mask, despite vaccinated. can't afford lose time work even Delta variant would give mild(er) symptoms. would also hate someone else got sick died unknowingly carried virus passed along, without taking proper precautions. 

Plus, y'know, want risk potential long term side effects variant this. India barelly alfa vaccination level high also. trust corporations inject mystery juice body. do, stupid pay life.  There's one person know posts anti-vax stuff. France last week, impression all. Masks worn 100% inside buildings. Netherlands, absolutely one wears mask anymore, expect public transport. 2nd wave spanish flu far deadly first that's recent history said living fear? nation becoming one haves have-nots, vaccination-wise. delta variant R-number 8. people unvaccinated, it’s get bad. think it’s also pride, age group got called booked within minute BBC breaking news notification.

I actually cried got jab. met double vaccinated CEV friend person first time day. Haven’t seen since Friday first lockdown. actual pub (outside meal) best meal ever eaten.

I cried actual pure relief happy tears, get second couple weeks think flood vaccination Center We're hitting around 75% Ontario alone. I'm sure it'll keep rising like Alpha did, US different. keep mind we're getting new information daily basis. highly unusual public spotlight medicine scientific community large solves problem real time. continually revise best practices response new information comes out, original model quickly become outdated. France isn’t behind EU average far tell. 53% total population first dose, well ahead vaccine friendly countries like Ireland, Norway Sweden, way ahead many central/Eastern European countries. anything I’d say vaccine uptake France large positive surprise! aren’t dying decision sensible one. need return normal.

As long there's still massive amounts population currently line first second shot, removing restrictions irresponsible especially UK peak new wave. Waiting weeks allowing unrestricted international travel spitting people mouth greeting kill anyone point, death ""avoidable delayable"" humans immortal? sure did. analogy seat belt wearing actually cuts logic. wear mask hanging group friends date? nothing preventing wearing one harm it.

You seem want choice wear one, want dictate others wear also matter people's personal doctors saying ""we now, administer right today, now."" Yeah, reached herd stupidity way anyone else.  R/technicallythetruth Absolutely not. vulnerable virus opportunity get vaccinated months point. Accordingly, risk severe disease solely ""them"" problem unvaccinated something ""we,"" fully vaccinated, addressing modifying behavior. people second doses

Not vulernable subset AZ-AZ less effective Delta

This actually looks wholly incorrect, looking new data Canada, Israel, etc. AZ infact better exit wave vs wave all

Nope.

Stay inside next 400 years want. stopping you. But, NPIs protect idiots take vaccine, vulnerable can't, vulnerable anyway, viable, frankly care care longer. We're afraid dying, cowards. Give source showing inconclusive reconcile statements: 'pandemic coming end' 'delta variant accounts 25%'?? read rest post? It’s minimizing risk. pandemic isn’t over. There’s vast number people vaccinated. Vaccination perfect. Virus could mutate become transmissible escape vaccine. 

Why… would wear mask? takes least amount effort could potentially save number problems. throw actual realism you... nobody suggesting ""lockdown forever"". experts suggesting keeping restrictions another weeks order get 2nd dose vaccination numbers up, 2-doses effective Delta (and COVID large) whereas 1-dose effective much population 2 yet.

Here Canada similar conversation. giving 1% country second vaccination every day. means delay 3 weeks gets 20% country 2nd shot. 50% overall population right now, well past 50% adults only.

They also got 80% over60s vaxxed least one dose, optimal still high, whatever future wave hardly cause serious trouble hospitals. fully vaccinated friend caught unvaccinated brother starting get sick (and ended sick!). He’s got mask back on! I’m currently France (I’m American) people probably care less COVID US. stopped requiring masks indoors tomorrow (currently aren’t required outdoors situations) imagine vast majority people would immediately stop wearing them. taking sides here, observation part. science saying

That's science saying. scientists saying that, surprisingly ones disagreeing government getting attention minute. Western Idaho wannabes come around point. Barely anyone eligible getting first shot now.  Sorry nuanced comment. recognize masks work reduce spread Covid. I’m definitely looking forward wearing mask future, however, pandemic subsides (which, will). 99.2% deaths vaccinations Darwinism hard work prove ""herd stupidity"" fatal I've seen indication there's plan that. could always return Canada get shots *really* want can't get are. (You'll quarantine though) beleive it.

And USA looking open entirely Labor Day.

Fall '21 looking good really optimistic vulnerable fully vaccinated adults least first jab. need wait for.  province in?  Yes can, I'm looking forward first sweaty mosh-pit! problem opening saying 'er, UK would basically saying willing accept deaths lower-risk age groups.

Delta causing MIS-C rate 1/1000 children. rate higher people ages 18-40. govt basically saying we're willing sacrifice people open up, rather waiting weeks many vaccinated.

I dunno rates UK, Canada opened big time 2nd vaccinations similar debates. currently giving 1% country second vaccination every day. means Ontario's 3 week delay stage 2 3 reopening allow additional 20%+ people get second vaccination makes huuuge difference slowing Delta.

Left uncontrolled restrictions, Delta likely make way every unvaccinated person within 18 months. assuming run even transmissible variant. timeline slowed way higher rates Delta can't get foothold. already happened Alpha - able get foothold UK caused flareups whereas countries vaccinations higher. That's good news people still waiting second Moderna shot. personally know want mix whatever reason. can’t eat mask on, now?

Well covers 1/3 scenarios mentioned choose wear mask. don’t know date pandemic end, day get closer it. true even ends 3028 extinction human race. (youngest kid). looks tho newer variants maybe infect vaccinated people-- worth risk. Yeah anti-vaxxer stuff before. troll. Afaik even harshest UK lockdowns people still allowed needed levels sunlight fresh air, there's nothing preventing bachelor parties honeymoon planned? Jc mine months respectively well! think unvaccinated/unmasked view us stupid. frustration roof go curbside pickup/pharmacy drivethru/fast food drive-up etc. note 90% 45% vaccinated town maskless. may bad math--but even figure something's that! supress actual number deaths. spread disinformation. kill anyone tries reveal truth. Agreed.  It’s big concern is. Sure, lets freak it, hope working improved vaccines booster vaccines, may additional variants come. don’t want situation deadly highly contagious variant vaccines can’t protect against. 

Again, shouldn’t freak it, sincerely hope working vaccines combat delta new variants. new variants much contagious deadly, won’t 1.5 years get right variants. oh noes... anyway  problem selfish undereducated masses breeding ground variants. Everyone vulnerable vaccinated high rate what’s problem? Deaths quite clearly staying flat.

Many people second doses, much UK also AZ-AZ less effective Delta (still good though grand scheme things). exit wave happen, better height summer, time potential surge flu winter.

The point weeks, many people could second doses. Canada position. ramped second vaccinations BIG TIME (just opened 18+, 31 got second vaccine Thursday) still relatively low; 7% country's second vaccinations last week. Ontario 2 weeks next stage reopening, many provinces fully open now. every day delay means 1% even country get second dose. makes huge difference slowing stopping spread Delta. 

We know x2 vaccinations good Delta, feel comfortable that. problem many many people got yet opening we're exposing many people virus (left uncontrolled, Delta infection results 7-8 new infections).

It exit wave vs. exit wave winter. exit wave vs wave all, longer stretched series smaller outbreaks (this always exist degree, everybody get vaccinated).

Most importantly, kids vaccinated. Everybody different level damage willing accept. Right science seems show MIS-C appears happen 1/1000 children, happens greater rates adults ages 20-30, UK second vaccines yet. Delta aggressive spread much rapidly restrictions lifted.   50% French citizens vaccinated, won’t mean 95% fourth wave cases involve unvaccinated citizens? ""Herd stupidity""  close none countries 70% coverage, especially Europe. New Zealand insanely behind 1st world countries vaccines rullout. long Idaho (which currently vax rate 38%) wearing mask public even though vaccinated. continue Colorado (moving soon) reaches 85% well. son gets hits hard cold/flu gets taking chance COVID  Wake bake meth  Same. Less 30% county vaccinated. youngest child can’t get vaccine I’m keeping mask on.   U.S. awash vaccines. get shot walk-in anywhere. excuses. 

Social Darwinism take here. Yeah I'm gonna start using that, top notch stuff Well, ""ALWAYS"" true... I'm sure contributed extent. think 'right' 'right' enough see anything like US's level refusal/hesistancy.   One students developed type 1 diabetes almost died. keep spreading info. other, indian redditor wrote thread , Delhi currently 96% antibodies. 19m ppl living cumulative 24,995 deaths covid (both original delta) originally 11000 deaths delta 56% ppl antibodies.

I think basic math tell severe variant is. Yeah “despite” warning behavioural scientist Twitter... great headline! Ireland behind, numbers messed due data hack health service getting numbers back now. 

On 30th June around 52% population one dose (compared 50.3% France) around 84.5% total doses administered (compared 80.64 France). massively ahead definitely behind put it.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

“One common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%.” Cases risen 3-fold since last monday. I'd say big fuck seeing fragile everything still is. Many many people said comeback argument awesome...

""Guffwhahaha gguf?? ridiculous.""  mist waves, believe me, it’s tremendous. Something missed people UK wave cases surging among vulnerable vaccinated groups.

The ""broken link"" cases deaths UK cases rising age groups dying begin -- vaccine basically created herd immunity older age groups contact younger groups much. 

The UK reports track much vaccine protects hospitalization, much protects catching COVID all. 

Last saw, around 80% reduction chance getting COVID, get it, 80% reduction chance hospitalized. 

The point though, that's reduction hospitalization risk catching -- 80%. people acting like phenomenally low risk hospitalized vaccinated, think they're implicitly seeing cases rise deaths stay flat think vaccine preventing deaths cases. think find unbelievable probably poor understanding vaccines work Covid works. you’re vaccinated, probably better chance dying via shark attack Covid. understand wearing mask want to, like it, want help protect unvaccinated people, want get sick various type airborne virus. noble fine reasons continue wearing mask. don’t think shocked people choose care things point probably anti-maskers too. sympathy refusing vaccinate. worry children can’t. experience can’t vaccinate usually mask. get vaccinated fine... Also outside time I'm guessing even better. say, say lot, good thing didn’t social media giving nay sayers voice polio vaccine came out. reliable actual study found 88% efficacy? Isn’t expected higher number people vaccinated (in case Israel, majority population), especially w unvaccinated 18 vaccinated 50 (common age milder breakthrough infections) would see lower efficacy rate, especially attempt use real world study?

Hope get better soon, smell taste comes back real fast.  Lockdown forever virus &lt; 1% case fatality rate without 2 doses, vaccines remain highly effective contracting covid protecting severe symptomatic disease/hospitalization. 88% number symptomatic disease. 

The Israel study lower sample size, also reflects ""truly back normal"" studies. 

If inject vaccinated unvaccinated people high levels virus, surprising vaccine 0% effective preventing disease. Similarly, remove restrictions, people would avoided developing disease previously may enough exposure develop it.  

It kinda makes sense efficacy drop fully opened, hold new data gospel, since still pretty low sample size. I'm sure actual study confidence interval can't find know right. Learned real quick everyone family, except father, bunch fucking idiots. Good them. choose whatever want, usually wait what's available. Pfizer AstraZeneca preferred obviously. Lot friends AstraZeneca seems problem that. I'm currently waiting queue rush TBH. glad pandemic soon over. I’m vaccinated! :) Masks help get lower dosage virus, good thing.  month anything amount cases? Covid go, June, let ramp up. statistic matters amount cases result death. see statistics rate incredibly reduced UK. Congrats!  621,295 :)  US, contrast, hallmark recklessness throughout pandemic refusing track breakthrough cases unless result hospitalization.

Another 307 new covid cases upward spiral 
 Jul 1, 2021 @ 13:55 
The Ministry Health confirmed 307 new covid cases Wednesday, highest since April, least one case 256 locations. number serious cases rose 29 22 Tuesday, 17 ventilators. 16,000 children aged 12-15, received first shots race use large stock Pfizer vaccines whose expiry date falls later month. Aside facemasks indoors, PM Naftali Bennett decided restoring restrictions combat highly contagious Delta variant dominating new figures. Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked said Wednesday flights i

www.debka.com/mivzak/another-307-new-covid-cases-in-upward-spiral/n Israel may suspended coronavirus cases continues rise. I'm talking infection prevention rates, Pfizer itself, robust prevent infection mRna technology, already 64% delta variant new studies released today. Idk… definitely long enough time impact create evolutionary changes. Plus feel like people back 1800 1900s less conspiracy theory driven. vaccine one time they’re given free health care refuse it. J&amp;J AZ use similar platform (J&amp;J 1 dose, AZ 2 dose), type vaccine rather dosing. Yes I’m definitely selfish wanting locked longer virus deadly thanks vaccines. 

No won’t get rid covid accept move deal like flu. 

People die horrible move life can’t keep locked forever. AstraZeneca 92% effective hospitalisations Delta variant *that* interesting. would say soon pass judgement seeing data. Israel forefront adopting vaccine *could* something it. could delta variant also stronger thought. could combination both. could also statistical fluke. Patience. can…. Go gig?

Hold me. Legally! efficacy rate keeps dropping across even mRNA vaccines, companies countries focused creating variant specific boosters. Yeah life isn’t 0 risk. Especially free readily available adult population since end spring. Plenty time get 2 jabs protect others still go fun sun. 

Now purposely diminished quality life rest it... stupid way self impose handicap. Yeah, almost. think 95% success rate means 100% success rate? turns pandemic result obviously poor practice part would be. controversial? shut unnecessary travel global pandemic.

Anyone? I’m curious, firefighters vaccinated?  really understand confusion here. thesis 600,002 things normal? However, rate unvaccinated patients among currently serious condition drastically decreasing: Sunday, patients serious conditions vaccinated stood 57.1% - including one child one pregnant woman. past months, almost 90%.

Delta 😒 quarantine de facto ban. This! epidemiologists believe COVID become endemic spread forever.

Hopefully gets less deadly. ⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣤⣶⣶ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⣀⣀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠁⠀⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⠿⠿⠻⠿⠿⠟⠿⠛⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠠⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠀⠀⢰⣹⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣭⣷⠀⠀⠀⠸⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠈⠉⠀⠀⠤⠄⠀⠀⠀⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢾⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⡠⠤⢄⠀⠀⠀⠠⣿⣿⣷⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢄⠀⢀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿ I'm I'm AIDS current global pandemic 900,000 doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 2.8 million doses Moderna vaccine one talking ways stop spread countries successfully done. got first shot end May getting second shot next weekend. Originally September. Things starting pick across country. Keep holdin' on! Considering one news report, dont even published peer reviewed article it, perhaps hold Doomist menatility till actual peer reviewed study comes out. mention, still protects like 98% severe infection, always main goal vaccine.   also know 1 person actually COVID. positive cases people know asymptomatic loss smell Good I’m going grain. We’re getting plain silly territory. fully vaccinated person doesn’t need thin piece cotton mouth prevent getting infected. even happen get infected, won’t get sick. Don’t want die Covid? Get shot aware shield, natural assumption positive case=unvaccinated person. since talking Florida, assumption postive case Florida = unvaccinated person = Florida Man/Woman Russian Federation enable ""excess deaths"". ran bunch countries states interesting reading. may figure pretty much vaccines around efficacy rate bigger determinant when/where trial took place. Efficacy seems vary lot across countries. Cheers mate rural counties number least one dose recently crept 30%.

That low vaccination rate.  I'd bet money dismissed grandparent's death away ""meh, old, time."" anti-vaxxers become experts explaining away Covid deaths inevitable always attributable thing (advanced age, underlying condition, etc.). 

I'll tell you, matter convinced virus vaccines lies, losing loved one would absolutely change mind. proven bust Delta variant.

Has it?  undoubtedly lot new daily cases UK past month - nearly Delta, huge surge deaths (so far).  I'd see win. sub becoming irrelevant day. considered “low”? Percentages please? sick vagueness.

In state Maryland 63% first shot, 50 second shot. 75% adults first shot. counties rates lower that, apply grocery stores Maryland counties lower vaccinate rates? rate? need details Fauci. Lmao dude got vaccine feel comfortable going places without mask. You’re literally making dumbass assumptions people dont know wont ever fucking talk to. new news though. Vaccines reduce chances harm remove completely.

In UK famous reporter (Marr) nasty illness (his words) need hospital 2 doses Pfizer earlier year. everyone 2 doses Pfizer worried?

Let's stick high level stats ignore individual cases. tell us anything. Every second passes we're closer arbitrary point future.  Generally speaking, number deaths (possibly hospitalizations also) involving unvaccinated individuals north 90%. Huh. Wonder changed..? 🤔  ... know much happening South Asia Africa. people vaccinated partially vaccinated Africa Asia, good probability may get varients. 👀 don’t want sympathy. want leave us fuck alone. Turn tv. Go outside. CNN told could get covid shadow, you’d sit dark rest life. think people really underestimating chance hospitalized double vaccines catch COVID. 

Per [most recent PHE data UK, page Pfizer vaccine infected is, 95% confidence, 10-118% likely hospitalized someone infected vaccinated. found 30% likely likely value. 

Keep mind delta 2x likely hospitalize alpha was. means infected, really like 60% likely hospitalized caught alpha without vaccinated. 

The reason seeing rising deaths UK due largely vaccinated populations catching COVID begin with. rise cases return normalcy still concerning. unvaccinated young people catching COVID that's ""fine"", many hospitalizations. vaccinated older people catching COVID, many hospitalizations still. Yes, definitive evidence Singapore able contact trace chains spread vaccinated people. Legalize Naps!  Braindead ass edgelord take. Really contributing substantive points bud. mean month see restrictions dropped flights leaving uk? Amber green list countries etc? think assumption may caught unvaxxed coworker. may reading incorrectly. Agreed. might ruffle feathers americans democratic party leadership UK conservative party leadership far far closer americans like talk crazy went one worst best vaccination rates short span. current rate 2nd doses amazing place fall. right. Vaccines best way unfortunately anti-vaxers holding us back. immunocompromised pay stupidity. instead calling immunocompromised cowards marginalizing can't restrict unvaccinated? headline doesn’t match article. nothing article fact."
