0,2020-06-19," didn’t lie said surgical masks aren’t helpful preventing wearer breathing droplets close contact crowded public settings. 

They also aren’t lying say basically mask helpful protecting *other* people becoming infected droplets you’re projecting speak/cough/sneeze - although doubt cloth mask much help vs nasty sneeze, still better nothing. 

I *did* read articles/posts N95’s won’t protect average Joe public super technical fitting done average simpletons don’t know wear one without sucking thumbs licking doorknobs (paraphrasing here). people liars, least arguing bad faith. pick damn size fits best - - wear *not* touching face much possible. Whoever said N95 masks don’t work beginning probably lying preserve supply HCW’s. said, really isn’t much reason wear one casual public setting like grocery store, long everyone else wearing cloth surgical mask. lot people assholes refuse wear mask “because tyranny sheep”, yeah, maybe I’ll say fuck start wearing N95.

The Gov saying masks don’t protect beginning, saying masks protect others now, bad faith outright lying. They’re true, fuller nuanced explanation required, eventually provided piecemeal, basically agree wear cloth surgical masks dies it’s safer. Unless you’re chronically ill, immune suppressed, higher-risk reason, case maybe wear N95. 




So it’s fucking simple “mask good” “mask bad”. different kinds different purposes use different risk assessment scenarios. come drew damn picture something.

Sure, prevent people going houses three weeks, time. one designed person per household allowed go food medicine every days, cars, travel.

Nah. That's extreme enough. delay works, China Europe proof that.

China seeing surge new cases, predicted, likely get worse. Lockdowns already returning it.

Europe? parts Europe? Surely talking Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom. trivially small countries nothing worry about, yeah? plans impeach guys? Pffft. past worse now. think right? Shocking. Neat fucking shit-hook. tiny, irrelevant, mentally ill, idiot. Make Brazil Great estimated 0.5% 1%. mortality rate American general give year .8% reason. essentially, given estimation, death rate increase around 60%. 10,000 people attend rally theres outbreak everyone gets it, around 50 people estimated die ONE EVENT many impaired life  anecdotally, there's data seen this?

Everyone else Asia pushing masks like crazy word *Activist* single apostrophe quotes. Well posted 33 minutes ago there's already 21 comments Ya, weird one.

I read something long blood viable? know doctor. Also, I'll take non-rebuttal admission I've point argument.  they’re one 40mm Americans lost job can’t pay citation? know people already said ""I get vaccine make one"" like wtf wrong people  No, reality complete opposite claiming.

By looking example mobility reports see people Sweden distancing beginning outbreak mid-March, successively relaxing stance lessened distancing, like people every country.

Here's Google's mobility report Sweden last month: another mobility graph Sweden spans entire period: people Sweden obviously shocked news numbers increasing distance, they're opposite, they're mostly behaving pandemic Swedish strategy fail continues is.

The death rate going down, steadily, two months now. signs going up. failure? would Sweden change strategy, obviously working, goals Swedish strategy obviously met?

I understand think Sweden *different* strategy, think Sweden failed *your* preferred strategy, that's perfectly fine! They're busy arguing whether want put one out, try force people back work. Man, everything virus makes thankful live Oregon. Air conditioning common south, we're still among lowest per capita 3% positive rate. really hard question think anybody going agree answer is. 

One think everyone could agree keeping hospitalization rate low enough collapse healthcare system. 

If guess 3 weeks looks like, think involve least handful regions ICU systems near collapse unless something changes. Good. go fuck himself.

Yes “but mah freedumb” people claim telling anyone got infected infringes “constitutional rights” would wonderful hand person card way in, ask anonymously indicate sat event, follow afterwards get sick. infographic showing many people get infected patterns -- number infectious agents entering, sat, gets infected result, long took -- would fascinating.

But course doubt people attending rally would participate. Thank you! That's pretty neat, frightening way. would entail? Nice would like do? Someone get tea! can’t vulnerable people careful? shut everything 99% 1% take extra precaution? government tools disposal stop hoarding.

haha, okay. big deal, Floridians want go New York anyway American Airlines also recently suspend serving alcohol flights passengers - EXCEPT people first class - effort keep people taking masks onboard? suspect plasma hand Trump. say insane things publicly anonymously online? don’t expect honest reply don’t bother. think ridiculous sound. Surely arse cavity would keep coronavirus out. know time everyone like, well, never believed anyway, truly, deeply skeptical. You’d see claims even surgical masks aren’t really effective, which...come ON! said above, would doctors wear masks garbage keeping germs? That's great point, since there's way he's winning Oklahoma (though would thrilled eat words November). Maybe big fundraiser (in addition ego-stroking)?

THINK LITERALLY SAY STUPID PEOPLE WOULD WEAR FUCKING WORLD R Yep really sharp shoot starts 8th-10th June? We're going see effects soon enough give days would wear mask. Fauci...the WHO, CDC... said to. 

Maybe lesson is, listen officials, use common sense. live Philly I'm glad trend downward. things may bad next door neighbors, things pretty scary. city cases deaths many states far, I've also seen lots relaxing health guidelines among public. became especially evident go city pick package Walmart, package theft become norm since pandemic began. nightmare say least. Employees masks noses around neck, store rule requiring masks, basically needed mask, wear around face. What's happening exactly said states reopening. cases going locked down. Whit real way combat virus yet, effective thing social distance avoid going places difficult so. think would happen? Can't argue said. first case recorded February 4. took 70 days total exceed 300,000 April 14. That's 2 months, 1 week 3 days.

Lol. heard virus may already present september China claim took 7 months reach first 300 000 Sweden.

Community spread Sweden beginning march. slope reported deaths, reported cases estimated cases steady throughout period. flattening. plateau.

Well. bit hard see since youve choosen scale timeline well hide obviously cummulative curve make even harder interpret. 
But theres pretty noticable flattening curve around march 27, corresponds well flattening deaths 18 days later.

Going growing 50 thousand per 5 days march 27. next 50k taking 6 day next 50k taking 7 days.  Mean incubation period 5.9 days. think number shows whether new cases increasing decreasing realize matter many TESTS done, people test positive, spike cases .....

If people test positive, cases.

Example. 

* State Tests 100,000 2 test positive 2 new cases. spike.
* State B Tests 100,000 5000 test positive, 5000 new cases. Spike.
* State C tests 200,000 nobody tests positive. cases. Must New Zealand.

The number tests irrelevant. number positive tests matters. positive tests means SPREADING community maybe people states need wake reality.

How Florida Texas hire governors clearly would failed Logic 101? graduate college? store work at. Obviously don’t mind AC constantly going, wondering today much pay it. Way fuel politics mask wearing fucking idiot. Yea. wonder kind work get there. Maybe get training workplace. I'm picky. Lol That’s true.

I suppose less agreement then, trying understand certain exercise futility. Yea, need normalize it. walk away can't handle conversation deaths appear declining according [the past table daily death chart. continue care anymore hard, poorly. Face shield effective masks read several studies. Maybe combination better  added feature “Not Spreading Deadly Disease” game. litrally exact figures link Florida. whole family childhood friend's Florida. response posted article? ""Don't believe hype. Fake news!"". Others responded(that live there) multiple fact based articles ICU beds, hospital's packing, etc. response ""y'all gonna live fear it"", ""keep watching CNN drinking Kool-aide"" know rest....

What saying never want step foot Florida again. Well, halftime America. may down, we're out. truly believe come together country, maintain conviction covid liberal hoax, prevail, like World War 2, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq.

/s Spread propaganda elsewhere programs pretty stringent (so far) effective measures place. B1G talking playing conference games, could see working. parts country masks still controversial, shot play even asking here? Block parties aren’t exactly remarkable going sporadically throughout country since weather turned nice. agree risk/benefit ratio? No. Others disagree. commentary? don’t know. There’s commentary ten dudes saw huddled together line Starbucks yesterday either. point attempting make? Yeah, it’s always good talk many people can, even if...no, especially different views own.

I agree, key lessons, philosophical spiritual aspects Religion like Christianity good, there’s much learn people like Jesus seemed be. Funny thing devout followers actually follows tenants, Christians would good world indeed.

And thanks, found book weeks ago, despite two steps away every Christmas haha. Classic Burton one favourite creators, it’s cool see way. necessarily good immune system, actually low median age, many senior citizens compared US Yeah that’s shitty argument. offense. I’m super sensitive plight condition, you’re talking able wear mask you’re working. We’re talking entering retail space. There’s comparison obvious either trying sell complete lie constituents rampagingly stupid position authority! Typical redditor nothing say contribute. agree, except people feel anything.

They feel cold. why? Madlad he's told  come follow god damn rules. Lived Florida 28 years. Never heard anyone refer area Tampa Bay. Totally understand point isn’t also issue opportunity cost playing? players miss chance showcase ability potentially improve draft stock. It’s pretty shitty situation. I’m sure players want play matter reason. Well guess Fantasy Fest totally nude 🤦🏻‍♂️ cases = vectors potentially vulnerable people work interventional radiology several hospitals Tampa Bay.

 want know? Oh god actually retarded true optimistic think death numbers impact politicians.

I mean already people die WW1. Yet still arguing whether wear mask.  forget blaming people coming NY too. Says 6 hr fake account. . It’s like 3-4 weeks really tell. incubation period 2 weeks. symptoms severe enough tested take little longer When? look Florida's official COVID tracker see sharp increase begins going try see escape auto-mod.

^ Yep.

Even though, electoral college broken 1920s Apportionment Acts restricted size house Reps. alone screwed everything, EC itself.

If couple thousand Reps, supposed be, EC popular vote would match. anything say bedsides telling people reddit smarter me? even trying dispute wrote Well, got back Fry's mask use way last time went good news. I'm central Phoenix.  herd immunity strong one  Japanese wear masks time covid. enough masks everyone. also culture cleaning. never first spike. They’ve steadily climbing pace hospitals keep up. Yeah guess that’s exactly things too, didn’t know since legitimately first time going 3 months. Lesson learned! absolutely not. Attendance race normally 100,000+ (more entire population county). race big deal - absolutely maximum 5000 people race. local people go races, certainly nowhere near 5000. out-of-towners.

I misunderstood restrictions originally - decided allow 5000 people **within 150 mile radius**, include people Birmingham, AL; Montgomery, AL; Atlanta, GA. Take look going places re: coronavirus cases/deaths. they've invited here.

You probably live understand situation appreciate bad, bad idea is/was. simply feel normal again, that's matters, right?

Dead people feel anything. live midtown Tulsa. fucking terrified. get give vaccine right? /S Bah. Booo. good non-partisan point would increase political awareness country Electoral College is. I’m even it. Without fans stadiums course. Like basketball 20 guys, 2 coaches, 3 referees. 

Have test game, can’t play two weeks get it? They’re able afford distance etc. 

It doesn’t seem terrible. Except pussies wear attack businesses burn shoot retired police officers looting TVs. Good question. Foreign adversaries, anti-Trump hardliners... course someone deliberately trying infect. I’ve declared everything legitimately UI. California time waived searching work always answered wasn’t looking work legitimately. asked come back tested waters stating explicitly turning work. Still paid UI. think maybe system overloaded point accept whatever one really reading them? Sure

Yeah, I’ve thought fact back-taxed come maybe next year. Might happen. Might not. They’ll coming someone making 0 money professional grad student come time loans dick. savings cover back taxing need — it’s order couple months. 

This ordinary situation lot UI qualifiers waived, especially since CA county NorCal big hotbed: imagine tech business traveling too/from Asia time US basically ignoring problem hospital work job? Every time sub claims work hospital ask question never get reply back. agree, seems like good approach. also need let creep mainstream, example, Target Walmart models wearing online ads, people wearing TV commercials, etc. Foreign adversaries, anti-Trump hardliners... course someone deliberately trying infect. autism currently even leave house family careful. breaks heart. Oxford agreements 300 million dosages available. Us citizen I'm worried getting one works. agree countries access. Keep mind, government rich want people vaccinated go back buying stuff getting back work. want money well. know, really irked too, wtf? Still can’t hide 5,000 extra pneumonia deaths (Florida).

That’s thing dead people... they’re hard hide. least first world countries flattened curve worst developed economies probably over, Sweden United States. States like Texas, Florida, California Arizona probably go Sweden approach point. crowded bars, nationwide Juneteenth celebration trump rally, cases continue spike end sight, Hopefully mandatory mask wearing become nationwide thing tougher social distancing measures bars, protests rallies. 

India South America choice go herd immunity, people crowded together there’s chance slow spread. Also entering winter virus active cause severe symptoms summer. Death rate could go 150% virus ravaged South America India, it’s gonna hell them. Yes. I’m Florida. Also, percentage positives going up. problem testing, problem reckless disregard raging pandemic, governor dipshit chooses money lives like master. may come eventually except Scottsdale. Inside? guys going peaceful protests zero incidents violence, calling everyone murderers literally Hitler, saying wanted people die, protests. 

You support protests riots thousands people also leading violence property destruction ending tear gas hacking mucous other. 

IDIOT!

Also, denying science pretending understand science denying basic genetics? trans person get pregnant impregnate someone sex FEEL like. man can’t grow uterus sudden hormonal profile woman without large amounts hormones also often dangerous time. 

I sit laugh foolish ignorant full confidence I’m right. Yeah anti-maskers missed...👋 new reality. what's horrible ""studies"" used justify us policies based data countries like brazil sweden singapore. country fell became laughing stock world, us government conveniently forgotten them.  honestly thought plural form “proclamation” never known trying fool people focusing lagging indicator. hours probe let guard Americans die needlessly. chaos destruction, want *some* reason.

People Reddit smarter that, go back Facebook want perpetuate misinformation propaganda. Twitter also welcome you, forget turn location. Oklahoma lovk Trump. Tulsans expendable him. Eh, apportionment acts 1920s broke capping number reps house. Without would working fine would match popular vote.

Law? Yes. Constitution? Nope, congress could fix time choose. seen happened Italy made lock-down time, virus could spread badly. big block parties DC today, convenient there’s commentary wouldn’t say? Snowflake. 🤯 Didn’t also blame recent spike Hispanic workers? guess trump attended public speaking classes. dr sound similar Crohn's could number issues either way id look diets associated autoimmune disease seek new family practice dr, possibly available telehealth visits reduce risk COVID19 exposure feel need mock someone? disagree? started disposable surgical masks uncomfortable fit well switched cloth, comfortable fits snugly. 

One advantage cloth able change masks many times day worry waste. get unfresh rather quickly. India's lockdown work would cases fucking millions! hundreds thousands would dead! Sure, I'll agree cases rise, happen India cannot shut long periods time!! Also people trying best government, blatant statement lockdown work fucking stupid! Custom masks rad Others. uneasy political environment + lot low IQ. west decades behind masks. Wearing flu season cuts rates insanely Asia. nothing alleviate situation 

There's lot dissect here, let's start part. What? anticipation killing me! see? That’s interesting. won’t hear anywhere, sheds valuable light situation. Thanks. 1. knowledge treat. 
2. Concentration cases big effect. cases spread hospitals overwhelmed, people get attention need. 
3. Lag. Death usually occurs least 2 weeks infection. happened Florida? wearing fucking mask make weak? idiot. Ahhh good ole reliable unit measurement...the MOOCH!!!!! Turn air conditioning, put hepa filters them. AC recirculating moisture droplets. Set cans front ac one me.

Everything seems 3 month delay west. includes realIzing mask helps virus novel ... top that, officials wearing masks ""Personal choice"", fuck problem fam? Even face pandemic,if highest ruling body government going act way, even God would refuse bless America anymore. wish atleast redditors would wear masks maintain social distancing, safe y'all! Ummmm. Fox, you? OK? ironically, northeastern area least impacted areas India. ‘The irony it’s mind’ IMDb. Meta critic. Rotten Tomatoes. *clears throat*

Prove it. joke. Thanks, Abbott. don’t think guy seriously planning go anywhere... think it’s young people infected. lots them. don’t die much older folks, statistically speaking Long term lung impact younger people still unknown moment. want bet health contribute study. obvious Trump give fuck number deaths especially mainly ethnic minorities, elderly poor health vulnerable. there'll less burden welfare state economy stronger. sees necessary cleansing, especially Bolsanaro even said it! tightening don’t know even restrictions. Things like 6 degrees Kevin bacon show takes one person spread thousands. said non politicized I’m almost 40

Can’t wait see simulate proctologist telehealth.

“Please zoom closer.... sure please widen spread... sir... sir.. oh fuck signal keeps cutting out” Depends many cases area. Also still come back good, terrible already lmao! law enforcement officer permission violate rights presenting clear present danger society.

If aren’t presenting symptoms it’s impossible classified danger threshold probable cause hasn’t crossed.

They cannot presume everyone infected, would assuming everyone guilty, would direct violation presumption innocence doctrine law enforcement officers follow.

A Doctor jurisdictional authority suspend anyone’s inalienable constitutional rights circumstances. ability act law enforcement capacity way. 

My words chosen specifically carefully, read wrote wanted say, claim I’m wrong, going prove beyond shadow doubt I’m clue you’re talking about.

Choose wisely... Mass protests??? know efforts people putting disclosing proper data like Florida.

Additionally take disproportionately large clusters like NYC national data definitely looking worse. Certainly food service full young people making low wages forced come work sick, infect unlimited quantity boomers demanding applebees wishful thinking. interests China gain lie deliver bad news? wear masks, society fall apart cults succeed resurrecting Hitler. Communists begin swarming shores, gates Hell open unleash demon hordes unsuspecting families!

For fuck sakes, piece cloth bottom half face. Society survived thousand years masks. think another months going lead Purge. think interesting hill reopeners choosing die on. Az like 15% pos dumb dangerous take never enter public health public service. see like getting pregnancy test 99 Cent store.

Apparently Columbus celebrated US nod Italian diaspora. Fauci Italian-American well? Might fit (altho direct frontline worker). 15 dead lockdowns. un-American thing could possibly say. I've saying since start. wear fave mask I'm scared Coronavirus. wear sign care health we'll family.

I wear respect fellow man.

If wear hope mother knows gave birth piece shit. good point. like never occurred idiots spike deaths states classifying deaths **should** covid, whatever comorbidity was. 

Go look actual wonder database track death codes. Nearly every single state hit covid 200-500% increase ""unspecified pneumonia"" deaths (above beyond counted covid deaths), heart attacks, etc, every place hit hard covid seeing mortality rates 80-95% expected mortality time year. holds completely true irrespective whether lockdown not. 

I'm sure look numbers come conclusion must overcounting covid real killer everyone staying home actively choosing die instead calling ambulance. Complete. Fucking. Dipshits. How’s Australia doing? Yep that's people seem understand. end hospital this, better damn good insurance. Definitely fan Trump, wonder pulling funds really among worst decisions. 
 
Do good work I'm considering justifies funds weird China allegiance? Please fill I'm aware stuff besides press conferences. actually pretty easy. Theres guy named Carl see... Face masks bullshit. non-hockey fans: Arizona born player 1st overall draft pick. Considered one best players league one popular teams league. short, big deal NHL.

He infected home Arizona. 1st rumor said Arizona Coyotes players skated also tested positive, official confirmation there. Brazil also known fake lot cases. Fox News polling Fox News TV different. least Texas freedom! /s theory salmon carries virus, opinion, may little bit premature. Though sounds absurd. excluding possibility true.

Most countries struggling huge numbers daily case cannot much resources individual case tracing. However, China, second small wave cases almost zero before, allow research origin. Could new middle carrier? knows.

Anyway, believe China needs research Beijing cluster. It’s good thought. Masks went mandatory I’ve seen quite bit people still going without them, saying still won’t wear one. know.. MuH fReEdOm! important part protests overlooked.

Currently US (and around world) millions people lot time hands usual, actually go rallies.

Normally people busy making sure get fired, pay bills attend protests. one main motivators leaders (political economical) keep unemployment low... ~~r/UnexpectedMulaney~~

Yeah, way we're getting CFB NFL season, there's way hell. many logistical issues one person team gets rona. lot cameras selfies least Congrats That's I'm saying. lockdown India work. wearing masks time? flu could kill someone. common cold could lethal someone.

Existing Florida nightmare. Honestly, never mattered.. People care... people always go out.. social humans..

Yeah, scary disease, deadly one level worst things experienced.

Man, favor people danger careful, limiting personal freedom. hard agree middle point? Mah freedums! Yup, freedom disregard science result death, great great. dead =/= hospital resources used. Known cases people 30 state Massachusetts hospitalized rate 1.5%, 30-39 3%, 40-49 5%. rates probably even lower known cases would normally hospitals full geriatric patients ventilators, young patients would normally admitted floor turned away tough home. start math napkin find even optimistic circumstances young people flood hospitals mitigating tactics employed. Hospital ICUs routinely flooded winter young, otherwise healthy patients influenza, would likely need medical assistance would gotten vaccinated presented doctor care early enough illness course one 4 antivirals actually anything.

Even normal reddit crackpot standards, one idiotic statement ever seen. cases means people (including asymptomatic) spread vulnerable. one wearing masks following social distancing protocol, inevitable. hard understand?  respect respect me.

I always start base respect everyone eveywhere, something take away fuck you. RemindMe! 3 weeks cardiothoracic surgeon told dialates doesn’t go back. thing keep blood pressure low, eat healthy, sleep lot cardio exercise keep bpms big boys wear masks

You want big boy? careful nursing homes vulnerable people. I’m amazed many people acting completely normal.

My friends leading normal lives cases exploding am. *worst* flu season 99.9% recovery so. That's still lot dead people, way, incredibly misleading use recovery rates.

For example, 95% recovery rate good? Creates GoFundMe, says rights infringed. Makes $500K. Winning Watch FOXNEWS day. Top ratings. anti-fascistic movement that's concidered terrorists. sub really American news tangentially related virus ridiculous. I'm expecting pay care sick family members, wrong society. feel there. time running out... can't stand longer. get 4yr degree. Bye bye USA... opinion. plenty large multinational companies here. Mainly due lower corporation tax compared rest europe. lot companies use Ireland European base. could idea stemmed from.

All countries problems, none perfect. there's lot countries would choose Ireland honest. pandemic definitely shone good night countries really exposed others president keeps sacking people say wants say.

Wait, country talking again? chance super spreader event doesn’t actually produce many cases significant amount cases, certain weeds going explode even explosive pace.

This lose-lose situation/gamble everyone involved. Masks actually help lot transmission via surfaces, preventing people coughing said surfaces. got things next job, Costco, dummy. Yes thank figured started chatting gentleman. misspoke. happens sometimes. ok disagree times, clarify know long would take economy major crash, economy always changes adapt changes massively worst quickly horrendous, great depression showed us simple lot people went broke while, tons death suffering occured sorts indirect ways. money loses lot value quickly people start quitting jobs like hospital workers truck drivers factory workers food plants,if takes forever waiting doctor know many people would needlessly die get certain supplies forgone better procedures would life saving. We've seen economic destruction cause untested hypothesis, get massive war china preemptively nuked india I'm telling want top great depression like event. thank condolences feel bad family, I've yet lose family member covid I'm aware possible,hell mom works nursing home long island.we're scary times thats sure. referring common sense getting thrown window. US fucked since day dot. 

‘We refuse pay taxes king!’. Ok, pay government gives many fucks king did. would argue never intended set democracy instead republic.

Those people would missing point This. Cuomo suddenly could get skyrocketing approval rating, Trump could gotten well. Trump literally got two separate golden chances gain popularity handed silver platter year, shat point bookmakers &amp; betting markets betting Trump Uhhhh...yeah think Id shave it.... lag well behind San Marino deaths per million. Ugh makes angry. Sure I'm ill high risk people right live lives best without people putting unnecessary risk. risk essential workers can't hide home day. see people neighborhood saying elderly sick cognitively dissociate problem makes sad. 
Put mask struggle breathing people. realistically, can't isolate vulnerable. practice, economy goes shit people die.

So long virus flourishes, hurts economy. short, effective lockdown better letting spread become endemic.

SK Taiwan's approach even better, failed that, lockdown next best thing.

For comparison, Sweden's economy shit. Death thing worry about. Go read covid19positive subreddit. stuff fuck long term. didn't. Seriously, telling state 2 months? Hospitals filled graves overridden, cases rise like there's tomorrow, heavy mismanagement part government. lockdown opportunity encourage people wear masks, use sanitizers, wash hands maintain social distancing, instead ringing bells, flashing torches chanting ""Go Corona Go"". Yeah, increased testing hospital capacity, that's getting overwhelmed well. work? Papa Jay trying raise us right teach us make good choices accord. He's all, ""I'll give count 3 stop recklessly spreading pandemic. ONE...TWO....TWO HALF....TWO THREE QUARTERS...okay guys really mean guys."" He's mad though, disappointed. government warned NOVEMBER things bad China, really really bad best prepare. intelligence warned US allies. US leadership chose nothing help general public. take action protect stocks though. One warned top donors stop sending people overseas meetings, switch teleconferencing even Europe.

They could started properly screening incoming people known sick areas cuz ban people coming china include US citizens legal US residents. let back months without screening tracking health warning track health. Hell fever checks adiquate least ccould caught symptomatics!

They could started buying PPE ordering companies production. ditto ventilators, ditto materials like much hoped vaccine - we're going need nearly billion syringes alone, think one estimate would take two years make many every US citizen.

They could dusted pandemic playbook started going though steps, warned states ready steps take distancing, CLOTH masks, basic freaking human hygiene since around half people normally wash hands using blasted toilet. Wait..wat? How..I can't even form sentence right now. found package hardware store bought took one one wife donated rest. wonder wears mask now! Switzerland, one wears them. Yea agree you.
It’s really annoying see people acting like phase 4 already. idiot compare virus fart SHIT Exactly! mask probably end law several places. lot senseless suffering. Maybe tone edginess bit?Anyways us get cases millions actually increased amounts testing.Our positive ratio rise now,so tell something.

The compliancy part subjective through-out states,in state Karnataka people mostly stopped caring fed up(mostly due false sense security created Karnataka gov).After gov taking virus seriously they?

All lockdown work,ask Mumbai Delhi.They know. horseman roach example fantastic lol Half people average intelligence there's people even dumber that.

How possible dumber average intelligence? ""Below average intelligence"" covers intelligence levels average intelligence.  Duh means it’s going spread regardless there’s spike trial error, doctors know 1st did. epitome stupidity. brain? \*confirmed. Brazil half US's confirmed cases already less 1/10th tests Evidence suggests impacts every major system body. know long term impact extent immunity is.  King County actually pretty well, although wish people would understand moving phase 2 mean end, means lull go back up. went park today giant party, lots large groups. run vehicle every 3-4 days battery die. Also, people accept free stuff instead properly making informed decision vote for. Welcome club, come leave ur masks door. wish could convey people crystal clear picture risk reward like behaviors increase risk getting thing. people really appreciated that, aside taking steps avoid mental health problems outings get basic needs, think vast majority would chilling hardcore home, washing hands appropriate. 

We know 'sequalae,' lasting consequences. know concerning things. 

We know symptoms typically far proportion clinical severity. ""Happy hypoxics"". People distress, oxygen saturation levels low. Etc etc -- meaning people likely reliable judge severity illness. 

We know many people continue symptoms many weeks, months? Forever? know. sure why.

We know blood clots major, major problem disease, would venture say best candidate primary pathology. start people typically heparin (anticoagulant/blood thinner) right arrive ER this, keep thinners usually month going home try prevent ad many clots possible. Clots often lead lasting damage, even small. autopsies done severe cases horrifying enlightening. definitely potential substantial microvascular damage restructuring lungs, good all. heart, kidneys, apparently brain lesser extents. organs want reduced function from... 

To avoid making essay - would make decent bets long term follow disease happiest story. would bet good percentage people hospitalized symptomatic mild cases lasting organ damage. 

With sort picture ""catching it"" may well involve. Trivial shit worth it. Wait out, take care mental health, good others muh freedumbs... actually got randomly called cell phone poll excited! picked local number live state cell number tend less likely spam. 

It ended obviously push poll political candidate. Like “if found Candidate Bob murdered puppies fun, would still vote him”

So disappointing! level kids brag lifting 6 chairs. kids, adorable. 70yo bikers, start wars shit get shot... It'll likely one two officers, any. Like said idk states regulations place means people can't gather like that. happened beginning chaos US may different now.

However, know people party non white maybe call cops worried that. hope none breathe heavily direction home.  Holy shit, people freaked nothing...  mathematical systems Apple Google come allow contact tracing without giving privacy.

The US excuse, government completely broken unable anything. Oh wow. could've possibly seen coming? going say ""Until hits personally, I'm going change"", _will_ hit personally _will_ make change. Last year, schoolkids protested action tackle climate change mocked laughed at. Today, 6 months later, major US cities, dozen countries EU South East Asia adopting Green New Deal plans legislations prevent similar catastrophes pandemic. wise thoughtful learning adapting. Climate change going much worse outcomes COVID - health, economy, society, politics, everything. COVID nature's warning shot. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/9LmDP) family members visiting pandemic patient ICU? explains anti-maskers. without capacity compassion angry frightened ashamed feel lash out. full display like spotlight showing wrinkles warts.

Better WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION!!! many people Facebook agree must true!!!

By way, butthurt comment decided comment twice, 10 minutes apart. comment thing mind period time must sad, sad life.  That's irrelevant, air gets sucked threw blown around airplane many air intakes? That's like saying bus safe good air filter back. think staying 6 ft away works wearing masks don’t? One reason give people don’t right, that’s reason believe doesn’t work. curious, think main difference staying far away someone wearing mask? virus transmitted attaching droplets coming body (mainly mouth) transmitted inhale said particles body. also live surfaces can’t mitigated staying 6 feet away. disagree this? lag spread virus amazing. worrisome Africa, hit yet, will. Florida open well, even nightclubs bars. Stupid funny. know many types of, ways be, funny. Right? /r/FloridaMan would **strongly** disagree. besides indoors, different massive protests we've seeing last weeks? lot Americans seem care American deaths. wasn't. Americans leaders incompetent, believe fairy dust, likely - gasp - corrupt too. 

Will good showdown first place was. person know they're talking about. Nowhere said waiting *person* come door.  Yet still arguing whether wear mask.

We're arguing all. We've got bunch ""morons"", Schwarzenegger would say. read Indian 27-floor house, another Indian filled bed cash instead sleeping regular mattress. US, leave company worked hired Indian H1B managers treated subordinates breathtaking condescension contempt. think India's problem cultural, financial. ... cat accidents

That sounds absolutely horrible. Also, tells fear cats cars.

On actual content post: crazy stuff, people weird, emotions amazing. justify get compliance, also lied masks don’t really work, don’t really need them. big parts living subpar, crammed conditions. afraif thst would hit India proper since January, belive hwrd stop there. see many people bashing Sweden coronavirus response. US better? US even imposed actual lockdown? 

Whoops, someone’s mad US fave Scandinavian nation stupid hell. follow pattern two reasons: (I) NY hitting 3k cases could test atm (Ii) social distancing one tightly populated cities. Anecdotally, 26 yo wife got called poll yesterday cell phone answered questions. like third fourth time that’s happened last years, clearly someone got phone number somewhere along way. Well get tested lot symptoms dry cough. Headache, extreme fatigue everything except high fever plus like cold pretty sure covid Watch guy: guy lot common sense, he’s also logical reasonable. He’s also apolitical. Pretty much everything said pandemic since January 24 become true. base policies behavior death rate, acting several weeks late. Yeah tracing hasn’t working well state (Ma) people know give names tracers people “have” stay two weeks loads people can’t afford that. they’ve gotten like 20-25% response rate know why. Peak 2693 deaths April 21. 300-700 per day. talking about? Jonestown Yep agree, done best could suppress thing. think would better humans economies long run. I'm glad people like choose wear appearal literally labels them. large bright lettering. Keep up! argue points made. never defended *act* itself. explaining worst thing world. relax boyscout. gave “courtiers?” Lol... WORLD DID.... faction trailer trash USA. Outdoors wearing masks Here's line them:

A condom keeps HIV away

A mask keeps COVID away

A mask face condom Leave Americans test limits stupidity Major League Baseball training camps temporarily close, source confirmed ESPN, multiple teams reported positive coronavirus tests spring training facilities Florida Arizona undergo deep cleaning, players need test negative return, according multiple reports. news first reported USA Today Earlier Friday, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants Texas Rangers announced would shutting facilities. Definitely reason wear mask, similarly, reason anywhere public without mask. guy gets covid, already breathing issues, hes pretty much fucked. actually use bixby? Tennessee still trying beat sec brethren actions prove otherwise. Yeah, seems perfectly reasonable assuming they're house hold. Wearing mask enclosed busy spaces makes sense.

If park, several meters away anyone else, necessary. Right now? Always has. Outdoors wearing masks. They're outdoors wearing masks. FUCK WEBSITES DONT GIVE ACCESS hell wrong site Thank work need I’m tired damn circus hell- enough one reasons got FB. getting crazy people thought smart turning ignorant. Listen, dead outcome care yes mostly true. HOWEVER, sick potentially weeks, scarring organs, blood clotting issues lost lung function happening many people. young person asthma really hate people say did. prolly won’t die don’t want risk future quality life. downplaying puts many others risk. good healthy young person show little compassion humanity everyone else please. This. I’ve worried thing. PANS/PANDAS ME/CFS + immune deficiency bunch issues. did. Hello across pond! grass greener Finally #1 said deaths continue decline. charted data says otherwise. Dammit I’ve taken political polls via email. One “check guy month make sure he’s still democrat” list. (Spoilers: am.) Official numbers real numbers? wonder happen fall young healthy get flu covid combo. young healthy friend die pneumonia spent week hospital months lungs full capacity. Oh wait announces Asymptomatic spread rare!!! Cool need worry any.... wait minute. science back up.... wait, oh retracted it. Thanks fine work WHO!!!!!! lockdown consisted shutting everything declaring half jobs essential. Pet grooming bicycle shops essential? ""essential"" businesses ridiculous. Agreed. Businesses reopening things nature dont help... wait till weather gets hot next week Northeast. Mask wearing people touching them, moving them, taking wipe sweat.  eventually people give up, see low numbers lockdown lagging, say fuck it, time dine service bars opening up. Soon fool learn magic fix stop testing. Boom. miracle.  Yeah. right answer there. Sigh. They're surveillance. That's promoting spread imo. true surveillance stripping privacy late laws get passed anyway. Corruptly incompetent incompetently corrupt? Arizona weekend. go Walmart get food family.

I arrived parking lot, carefully ensured far away anybody, put mask leaving car tightened fucker TIGHT.

I took deep breath, walked Arizona Walmart, impression people would scared anxious like wearing masks. also drove multiple restaurants bars PACKED people. Live music. Crowded. ZERO masks. 

But, single mask. Dozens people Walmart literally one wearing mask. Mark words, Arizona likely rival NYC April. sad. Baseball seemed like long shot anyway 100% accurate. general consensus that, people around aren’t Democrats, virus isn’t something need worry about. don’t understand choose acknowledge isn’t viruses work. polluting ocean entire time. yep. NY broke 1k again, first time couple weeks. think somebody coughed slaughtered salmon meat,just frozen down. virus would kept intact. They're also ignoring fact young people serious, long-term complications. Yes, might recover, health long-term? permanent lung damage neurological issues now? many unknowns. There’s indication lingering cases post viral syndrome. 

All indications lingers amount time unprecedented viruses shit Sherlock. really should’ve listened Taiwan Especially nice you. corrupted soul. Yep. early efforts flatten curve, kept hospitalizations max capacity stopped burning country like El Nino fueled wildfire, lose half million people month. that, listened painted talking heads saying hoax overblown fear mongering biases reinforced. Nothing short rural communities getting turned ghost towns change minds now. live working masks sucks nuts. see problem that. Survival fittest, commonsense worst thing happen considering harm people tend wreak others. accept lead horse water, can't make drink. Let nature take course now. delay larger think. 

The deaths coming. guess, may BLM transgenders. Yeah experiment Sweden met expectations 405k don’t want click mean riots protests? mean free-for-all people seem think well kid Tom Hanks play ghetto boy guess Kid Rock too. Currently live Miami. like nowhere else country. Yeah people realize mask usage mostly slow indoor spread? Obviously going someone's house interact wearing one great take afterwards get break. People act like things part face. That's like arguing seat belts useless fucking retarded realize supposed wrap around neck. Nowhere wants get infected mate... get headache end wearing work 8 hours. Yep. crazy think votes cancel votes say Sam Harris Richard Dawkins. People country attending? Maybe next counties? unlikely, may superspreader event. not, feed myth COVID-19 hoax joke, fewer people follow CDC guidelines like wearing mask social distancing. convenient blame leader. true Bolsanaro abhorrent, Brazilians elected him. fault well. hill that? Yea like....who wants sneeze mask. That's nasty, might even get sick cause germs trapped there. /s  Trump finally War President alot simpler that. Intelligent people wear masks. Stupid people don't. Wanna make guess mask-wearers say they're voting year, compared mask-refusers? China data unreliable!  wrote longer reply sourced data, bot got me.

look beyond texas see data indicate positive transmission happened noticeable numbers protests cities folks wearing masks. god created virus. right swing fist, ends nose.

Your right wear mask ends 2 meters me... say again! So, 18 reported daily deaths. 9 elderly, 8 middle aged, one young adult. disagree one bit CV far far fatal 70 keep reading articles blurbs talking elderly happen you. least deadly - contrast hcq bleach... live miles south Fort Lauderdale neighborhood full Russians. Lots young Russians lots babies. One interesting thing early discovery virus China resulted abnormal CT scans showing [“ground glass opacification . hope don’t sound judgmental would love hear test results chance test (which think stage CT scan check GGO antibody test). lol People kept saying joking said pro sports year. mean favorite team makes World Series (assuming even got far) 1/2 team tests positive? Dude idk hope not. certainly type. Trump supporter through. Right. US. It’s called air conditioning worldwide lmao cooler food drinks. saying would scared disease likely steal months life another disease likely steal half life? I’m glad don’t live Arizona! THANK YOU! We're 6 months pandemic authorities failed us giving mask positive perception. redneck riviera. Plugged WHAT? Oh come on. reeks arrogance. Lead example please. things making people less likely wear masks. guys think 'bad'? Downtown St.Petersburg, Fl literally filled people area whole block similar sidewalk.

Welcome end zeitgeist, shown us coming 153 years.  pretty normal humoral antibodies fade quickly? Honestly man, really say things like this. supposed biological warfare. I’m California’s Bible Belt I’m seeing 20% mask compliance shopping, including staff. Im expecting situation get much better anytime soon. somebody's job involves reviewing movies, choice anyone worker. Granted, we're probably talking relatively tiny number people, going theaters critical job going office others. like pretty much everyone else forced go work environments known ideal coronavirus spread, find idea extremely stressful. evaluated Ehler Danlos? Yano? Yup..
Gotcha finally starting government’s herd immunity strategy? Negligent homicide uninterpretable study compares medical mask use cloth mask use health care workers. 

1) doesn’t compare cloth mask use mask 2) it’s asking cloth mask use reduces transmission population.

The reasonable conclusion medical masks protective cloth masks, something really question. It’s relatively good compared places US, still struggle. work Starbucks (in Northeast) constantly remind people need mask inside store. Daily arguments people getting told fuck part new normal.  One successful case proof concept  says 14-day window big day graph. time spent bodybuilding forums listening various men talk healthcare since passage ACA, obvious able bodied conservative men HATE weak vulnerable. way, would bring back Nazi era eugenics. Dipshits dont get decide anything irl internet speak....

Just rember us said aboit xD say unmasked people confined areas: ""oh, I'm helping elderly parents mess. I'm sure would wear mask too, parents (or grandparents, depending age) close to."" immediately shuts small talk - stupid talk - seems make pensive. gotta get personal breakthrough noise. Brazil might beating us. Come Bolsonaro! Wait, they're really trying tell herd immunity great idea all? nearest city Clemson Greenville, accounts become hotspot, sadly surprising. Also I've got family reopened pretty quickly.  weird thing fuckheads wear masks operating delusion ones going ""make America great again.""  

No, they're not. They're killing people pandemic, seem oddly eager drag America civil war make America great. 

No, make Russia, China, enemies Middle East great. 

Sorry, fucking despise people. Thanks.

Stimulants prescribed treating anxiety depression.  Minnesota, north go south are. excuse? dirty secret lot healthcare family members lot essential nursing work. people discharged hospital hours surgery? possible family member care you. kids school? parents stay home care them. problem everyone's home social issue happening quite adults, probably women since traditionally feminine role, unable return paid work caregiving needed home. 

There's old argument circulated healthcare disability benefits another layer providing financial assistance caregiver well ensure necessary support acute periods. still cheaper keeping everyone hospital improves recovery time prognosis patient too. might happen, yet that's disease dragging on, something different altogether. think ""real numbers"" governments hiding. Even made real numbers, would estimate. make estimates well. One estimate multiply confirmed cases 10. Yeah let's applaud falsifying numbers getting increasingly bad right  time need interact anyone human human level see facial expressions. pretty much human interaction. Everyone knows world war 2 democratic hoax, created put George soros head best buy, attempt overthrow toys r us world's leading Nintendo retailer. wanted make sure trump office decades later. troops shouldve back work getting haircuts, fighting war good faith argument (which one made people) virus getting less deadly, overall CFR decreasing, particularly, individuals getting infected lower CFR earlier individuals.

The idea earlier virus, less testing serious cases tested confirmed. Therefore, likelihood person tested positive would die high. begin testing more, confirmed cases milder likely less risk population. means currently, likelihood person testing positive die lower before. virus less deadly, seriousness case today lower seriousness case earlier epidemic. guys think 'bad'?

Welcome end democratic capitalism. great. think lot obese teens America  People protests weren’t sitting within inches one another hours end. Close proximity leading driver spread. Remove masks introduce minimal hand washing, situation beyond ripe super spreader. protests. Floyd funeral (60k people attendance). Doubt Denmark great without masks. I've two protests I'd say 20% people wearing masks. decided that.

Tear gas also sucks. numbers prove US exact opposite that. actually counting COVID19-Related pneumonia deaths COVID deaths. Regardless Trump's sycophants say, stats show non-Covid deaths multiplied pandemic, probably related COVID deaths counted such.

If non-COVID deaths counted see sharp decline non-COVID deaths along growing numbers pandemic casualties, case. Mayo clinic telling people wear masks cus people touching face on.

Of course OK COVID-19 fights germs. /s fact don’t even option go every 20 minutes point. 

A cloth mask never seal face. surgical masks. 

My whole issue we’re arguing fact next “safest” really safe option. way Trump could force companies produce more, hasn’t put act place yet.

Americans already long pariah travellers covid 19 existed.

Even internet existed, countries sick americans travel. generally respect whatsoever culture, values language, laws countries visit.

Back could go airbnb book room, people recruiting travellers bars would avoid americans dont want americans staying place.

This americans would put canadian flags luggage abroad pretend canadians. remotely shape people rally national guard security guard towards beginning photos. I’m sure it’s honor people get coronavirus Trump rally.

the fuck. Well that’s apples oranges. places people it’s going worse. see buddies post Facebook crowded bars, singing karaoke, going strip clubs, packed. Im different state. price 3 bed, 1 bath barely land state could buy fucking mansion OK. Seriously go look 500-600k OK gets you. beautiful four bath behemoth building lake. house would like 2.5 mil lol.

And 3 bed, 1 barh houses OK? could straight buy outright.

Its kind appealing except realize living OK, tornados, surrounded people think attending Trump rally pandemic wearing mask smart idea. S+3M 😉 COVID-19 thousands people can’t stop seeing “next coming” thought newborns allowed near many people. child endangerment? see there. Go get tested. tell boss test employees. Hey original post!!! Also you: Grandma, Trump said need die economy might recover. poisoned food unplugged oxygen tank. blood god sacrifice. Oh Jesus Christ! Good job, let’s keep fail train going! Modern problems call modern solutions Different vaccines look promising taking different approaches, try make blanket statements response. 

Yes 100% correct mutations meaningless, not... getting lot chances replicate mutate humans.

What meant far effectiveness vaccine goes finding one works well. Vaccines 100% effective preventing host contracting virus getting ill it. even gives us 10% better chance getting it, likely going push (50% would much better).

Literally clean cloth item atm. realize one person infect hundreds matter couple days..? are... keep boomeranging. Also, ppl acting like things normal America. Wearing mask small thing still lot ppl refusing comply. I’m south Florida it’s getting bad ppl like it’s good.

Americans getting deserve ignorance. ppl say oh get back work. Ya could closed 3-4 months reopened August government assistance time. Unprecedented times call unprecedented measures. Would cut death right half. fact knew stop didn’t enough haunting part this. There’s definitely better care likely capacity hospitals. sad, contributing, factor virus probably took vulnerable right beginning (generally within specific subgroups), new cases arise likely less vulnerable people begin with. Full hospitals many deaths seems thing could spur change. California bad well Quit spamming, weirdo. Excellent, please underline quote visibility. Doesn’t fit narrative discount it!!! went Disney bought easy pass..... Go back Facebook BS comments. proud way Newsome handled crisis now. ever occur masks likely donated businesses? struggling small business would benefit donated masks. 

I absolutely problem wearing mask. Statistics don’t lie major upswing new cases. taken pants Canada support never delete anything. make sense, used ""it"" three times five words. Go back school. Shoo fly.  Yeah that's good point. people may scared. According governor overwhelmingly hispanic farm workers. minorly hispanic like rest us? admit, think second wave would rise quickly. Millions people protesting lead harmful effects.  get you’re coming from, yeah, don’t really understand mindset it’s something need get used to... least normal flu various colds right now. vaccine? Yeah, potentially might stick around become something get used to... situation drastically different.

Bill Nye type scientist world suggest searching definition scientist since obviously Based know, isn’t something panic over. totally understand feeling uncomfortable returning classroom, hell I’d feel uncomfortable I’m 25 year old male.

I’d definitely make known don’t feel comfortable full reopening district. I'm set like said. feel obligation continue discussion shown quick react attack are, easily make assumptions others based brief interactions, disingenuous actual debate points. doesn’t even make sense would interesting demand would be, people coming reason priority.

But think would frenzied search toilet paper months back. Wow. great article. Thank info, appreciate providing it. helpful understanding effects large gatherings groups plan school year start. Thank you.  covid spreads trump events blm protests okay? Interesting virus works   Whats over/under next peak daily new cases? see US peaking 45-50k day soon, maybe im optimistic. I've using NYT's map. update least times day. Probably positivity rate also increasing highly effected areas. positivity rate combined testing figure indicate trend area. testing higher positivity rate indicators greater viral spread. Grift. safe Thank encouragement 🙏 bet DeSantis end super-spreader. Yes. don’t want kill grandmas. helpful also very, sad. Wtf: company done better job cleaning providing personal protection equipment. finally getting strict enforcing mask policy”  Yeah, thought might troll, checked post history think he's actively *trying* get downvotes. think may ass. countries locked mostly delayed inevitable. get deaths summer instead.

Remember Swedish government supporters used accuse rest us hoping see deaths Sweden justify belief Swedish ""strategy"" mistake?

Funny tables turned... ones desperately hoping people die countries that's way justify Swedish seems paid off. 

Denial river Egypt... We'll see it, doubt average citizen (non-US here, Europe things might look different we'll see) get jan. 2021, latest would expect march people/places US/Europe/Eastern Asia, share optimism bit. might possible get shot new years. Texas f\*cked.... Best covid world sucks every comment could reasonably make would removed ""purely political"". really disagree rule that's come with. Agreed, curious numberd well, haven’t seen good sample data. Doesn’t mean people protesting outside house wasn’t dumb shit. agree lot article. incredibly easy core Reddit demographic demand things stay shut. percent Reddit still school dependent sort? percent Reddit job done remotely? really easy tell people make sacrifices ""not kill grandma"" people need put food table. Northern MI much spread, thanks low population, quarantine started. goes show much difference acting earlier instead wasting month would made. contrary united states guess We’re Number One! USA! USA! USA! Whooooooo! Obviously that's practical, let's tell stay away anyone white hair they're living lives. That's perfect policy, seems better one shutting whole nation. pathetic truth people actually falling shit..... big spike starting hitting Tuesday since 10% every day imagine come next Tuesday average quite bad. Arizona bad yet still want NYC. Dutch much lax, find sex buddy stick sex chat one gets infected free people? Don’t talk social contract it’ll enforced gunpoint. That’s contract worth signing. you’re worried stay inside, moralize online, snicker want. People losing livelihoods, communities, lives. blank check, zoom calls, moral posturing fix that. Probably California got really bad...people going Vegas vacation can't good 11 percent better days, still implies robust spread.

lot places worrying trends testing data. kills see local media not.....latch onto connect dots. earth would people know recipient is? Regardless, objectively jerky schnook. Well, problem people New Jersey, isn’t it. excuse personally wearing mask? winter* really understand difference people?

The risk you... everyone else around you. snowstorm came through. Parents paid expose households Covid.  Again. talking someone symptoms. think someone symptoms go normal life? hope win. completed data dated? mobile don’t see that. There’s dude. It’s easy say “just stay home” you’re good it.

Imagine virus (somehow) made recommended play video games, stay home except sleeping, go reddit Internet. Would really easy? sure could use link 24 year old ammo vs 25 year old buddy thinks joke. This. statisticis pandemic, positive PCR rate one really need look 7 day average. Number tests given day systematic all, really anywhere. Highly variable usually dependent whether something special's going on, like attempt test everyone retirement homes prison something. pulling #'s summer, wtf coming fall?!?!?! percentage this. 20,000 cases many long term issues. 100? That's one question none articles important thing infect people damn selfish take precautions im one replying obvious joke bode well sports coming back year. impressed precautions NASCAR had, seems enough. cant see contact team sports happen short absolute bubble months, far, seems athletes interested scenario. nucleoside analogue whose mechanism disrupt viral replication. cursory genetics knowledge obvious would candidate drug. reason Remdesivir tested. made us great something people happy jumping car go ice cream want restrict people’s ability provide livelihood families avoid another risk similar risk lifespan, would say unreasonable expect people them. I’m Kansas City, Missouri one wears mask. Last night driving home picking groceries restaurants packed like 30+ people waiting outside tables(it 4pm Friday normally busy). It’s crazy! Luckly husband works home I’m stay home mom don’t go out. pick groceries curbside pickup. hopefully won’t catch it! one thinks it’s permanent. got wait time 2021 Friday afternoon, 65 people hospitalized COVID-19 county 17 “fighting lives ICU,” according doctor Henning says it’s highest hospitalization rate since pandemic hospitals reaching capacities taking care COVID patients still battling severe outbreak nursing homes,” Ansorg said.

If multiple hospitals handle 65 Covid patients, problem. 30 year old friend health. 

Now kids don’t father. ignorant westerners believe brainwashed lies reminder everyone forgotten:

Deaths lag cases. Would explain deaths dropping quickly See 2 weeks....and another 2 weeks...or however goes brah is. around 100-200 cases around 2 weeks (down 2000 day). However, last e days slightly higher numbers downward trend going. Looks slowly rising again. God help us... There's still experimental treatment, mostly supportive. experience comes knowledge patient going worse another. hard explain, see patient know they're sicker even though one specific thing tells that. contagious virus Dope Futurama line technically still warm Another high testing day US. 583K, 6% positive. probably brought Italian Army. /s Based upon established correlation rural areas ""uneducated right wing assholes"" listen science. I'm assuming calling that. jaws floor first year understand he’s never going say anything intelligent meaningful Happened too. auto mod way strict u/bluecamel2015 swears eveything alright Fuck new normal fuck corporate pandering. I’ll take risk. body choice right? me: exceptions, like hugs, miss human proximity found traveling socially distancing busses far less anxiety inducing Yup, might take time get bc population density I’ll put money table time virus runs it’s course Texas dead new york Lol them. many Cali Arizona plates around town. seen already, one Atlantic excellent topic: european i'm watching images event currently ongoing allowed talk forum jaw literally floor. said permanent? CDC tracks weekly pneumonia deaths US. Historically worst weeks winter. 2014 2019 CDC reported 0 weeks pneumonia deaths 6,000. 2020, starting April, 8 weeks 6,000 pneumonia deaths. CDC reported 69,483 pneumonia deaths 8 week period. 8 week span 2019 CDC reported 27,091 pneumonia deaths. point overwhelm hospitals though. hasn’t happened anywhere US. Wow epidemiologist too? 

Add pharmacist, working bioinformatics, developing drugs, expert bariatric surgery, working virology. 


Just much education dude? going public “can’t anything”. joke news story. kid clearly went DKA CNN reporting symptoms covid symptoms stating perfectly healthy died without warning Dumbass protesters gonna destroy MURICA Brexit based fear though. screwed start Trump ran around month calling virus hoax. set narrative base, view every response contain slow spread anti-Trump conspiracy.

This America, even pandemic fought partisan views reality. would recommend watching Edge Democracy Netflix. documentary events leading Operation Car Wash lead conviction many Brazilian politicians corruption charges. highly politicized largely way right wing secured power country period massive popularity Lula Worker's Party. difficult determine legitimacy corruption trial primary federal judge ideological goals.
I'm sure accurate would call coup vein many historical right wing military coups South America definitely elements ideological conflict rather good natured attempt clean Brazil's politics. merely rising tide tsunami. Boomers finally dying greatest transfer wealth human history, assume plenty preparing it. No. fault governments utilize time bought China, detect virus earlier, reopened economy expense people. wow. 1918 event. gov around world made sure plan another one system etc set up. gov gov ether du funded dismantle it.  county (in Michigan) new covid case 4 weeks 1 person wear mask 100% time office 25. old/sick/unhealthy/whatever going die soon anyways.

Somehow logic helps people look mirror. corp last year, I'm Florida, maybe Florida thing. ran claimed k1 personal taxes gov get it. They've watching movement data. phone went rally phone also ends hospital treats covid... legal weed. 

100% better Ohio. country ""handling"" cv quite like Brazil... skeptical change number mask wearers though. context please Look, I’m scientist. I’m telling paper sucks doesn’t address support claim. It’s personal attack, made claim utility cloth masks protection.

Cloth masks mostly security theatre actual protection.

They likely similar nothing protection, much better nothing outgoing transmission. Depend mechanics “cloth mask” actually is. We’re better population people wear them.

IMO￼, giving people better options us. Reasonably fit surgical mask would much better bandana nonsense. Personally, don’t wear cloth mask. wear N95 go someplace want actual protection. No, 

Another way stores $50 fee wearing mask every order goes 'Hazard pay' fund employees, get keep 100% / divided hours worked total employee hours week. 

But make mandatory businesses implement this, use mystery shoppers check compliance, list businesses fail comply public website, fine them. 

At point feeble-brained people wear masks, need protect rest humanity degenerates. fully reopened economy + masks, masks + lockdowns. can't both. Use Face Covering Protect * Wear face covering help protect others case you’re infected don’t *Keep covering face entire time you’re public Haven’t grocery stores! talking restaurants true.

[Disclaimer can’t compare now. Things overrun, hospitals know do. Doctors didn’t even PPE. Many new cases apparently younger people. can’t assume everyone gets infected automatically going get hospitalized. Considering vast majority sadly pass older, younger ones majority getting infected now, can’t expect result. beg differ ... see: Jared Kushner Good them, probably qualified personnel retirement homes.

Lots countries locked worse death rate Sweden, even over.

There's reason second wave Sweden since behavior consistent. meanwhile USA looking 200 000 projected deaths October. Exactly 🤷 That’s assuming there’s treatments vaccine found, though. ventilator start beeping send alarms unplugged? medical devices nature built-in safe guards this.  type exponential math curiously absent every country earth.

And exponential math, brazil's cases set double every weeks something.

But brazil went 20k-25k daily infections 55k infections within 24 hours. 

This following scientific model laid far. ""My body, choice""/s 
This freedom gone mad, would though China could come weapon perfectly targeted Americans. You’ll freedoms it’s gonna cost ever know! tell Americans government prohibits use masks. Hmm... guess would result run masks PPE. utterly failed prove claim 

No - proved claim chose ignore it. repeat you:

Most Europe even [tested see here.

Only ten countries tested 10% population. 

38 countries tested less 10%.

25 countries tested less 5%. 

France - despite one highest death counts - tested 2.1%. 

And 12 countries tested less 2.5%. 

**There - little exeception - large, widescale testing carried country Europe.**

Therefore, little TTI done anywhere Europe. They're even testing. might be. saw something Reddit weeks ago claiming “nose breathing safer mouth breathing nasal passage tissue generates nitrous oxide inhibits coronavirus”. even link reasonable-looking research paper subject. However feeling paper talking breathing *in*, *out*. see someone might decide twist way though. problem USA stopped deaths yet. going continue get much worse.

The US really needs start state border closures point avoid hotspots (FL, TX, AZ CA (sadly)) infecting states control.

Suppression virus best way ensure economic recovery. Agreed. knew Sweden, shocked this. went back time told January things would look like Sweden would beleived you. would expected Danish / Norwegian / Finnish / Icelandic reactions sure, would figured Sweden would gone along them.

It's sad, worse take responsibility admit fault (beyond 'we protect elderly' tbh another scapegoat since barely country managed protect elderly). 

Well, least least *signalling* change strategy herd immunity TTI even though current authorities *probably* never, ever admit failures meaningful way. also testing lately, *just* signalling anymore: . heartening, despite leaving bad taste mouth openly admit failures. FOOLED DOWNTICK.

16577.

that 18.7 percent positive rate. says reason cases tests given. true, statistic follow would percentage tests given come back positive. [That percentage rising everyday. Hard articulate amount nonsense world offer. Thanks 💪 looked google play store.  seems one app, far, covers Rhode Island.  states application code month, about. would think could compiled now. probably understand now, ELI5 - thought pre-existing conditions really thing anymore laws passed around ACA? Wait, thought cases supposed little lower Saturday, lowest Sunday, slight increase Monday, bunch cases Tuesday make case drop weekend... bad situation higher Saturday? sure let’s reopen. I’m asking fit overall count compared every country. sure got downvoted literally says aren’t counting “confirmed cases”.

I'd say employs hundreds thousands probably across country. Yes matters. 

The vast majority people stay state, especially now. Policies state significantly reduce number infections subsequent hospitalizations deaths.

Go Statistics Sweden website show published correction earlier press release saying number deaths week 22 5-year average.

They haven't.

10 days later, we're still seeing bullshit claim posted neither Statistics Sweden, media misreported press release, corrected information.

If want find really happened week 22 download Excel spreadsheet provided Statistics Sweden calculate total yourself.

Honestly.. affecting lot countrys bad America actually took seriously, fucked reason America made political fucking joke.

Honestly people make argument make bumbling morons..

I'm sick Americans making wearing masks common good fucking political stance, grow fucking immature children. think, days later Trump comes Phoenix next rally, area far cases begin with. look post history see user reply piece filth zero regard around her. best ignore her. Yes, would’ve (temporarily) supported it, least mess. Instead incited division gives middle finger science chance gets.

Not turn political, are, good ol USA, 2.3million cases; highest world ridiculously high margin. British say, bollocks. wearing HAZMAT suit would protect catching coronavirus.

No, understand science. else could done? see thrown around time bashing bashing could done? mean?  Wow, sad excuse.

Asian countries long since culture mask-wearing prior pandemic, new idea came with. want see coronavirus spread damage already has? No.

Am hedging bets there's gonna record number cases around people go convention? strong maybe. 12% people live nursing home passed away COVID. state second highest cases deaths per million. governor ashamed. Yes no. 

Yes, didn’t know sure asymptomatic carriers. previous virus similar covid use order make proactive decisions. Oh right, SARS. SARS asymptomatic carriers. also knew R0 value Covid higher SARS. 

Also, masks need worn healthcare professionals don’t help? Look wording, don’t help general population. Hmm. 

I understand hindsight 20/20. I’m saying everyone fired incompetence. I’m saying lied made worse people fence before, aren’t wearing now. 

I knew lie minute read tweets. family wearing masks mandatory. MAGA masks saw someone twitter saying U.S. higher number reported cases EU U.S. testing EU reporting. seems like easy way disprove (or prove?) would show number positive cases total tests get percent positive cases. anyone graph/article info?  problem it. also ban many protesting month w/out mask.

The healthcare system collapse occur uniformly. massive country. really depends state. 

Some poor states quickly ran resources asked federal government, richer states day really suffered much blow.

Some states disease spreading rapidly, others lower population density also getting hit much.

The answer is... depends. mean, bad average, see numbers, really can't view country big single uniform entity. article recently said 80% wear masks, spread drops massively. I’d say mask wearing saw protests looked that, wouldn’t agree? like idiot detecting geiger counter. maga counter. click click click [Or it’s whole heap inject monkeys vaccines, become immune subsequent challenging virus. Phase III clinical trials vaccines establish immunity humans pretty soon, know humans develop strong neutralizing antibody responses virus recover. Likelihood humans immune reinfection pretty much zero point, although proving clinically absolute certainty still done.

Immunity likely permanent, though. Booster shots likely recommended. Reinfection, though, less severe next ""wave"" coronavirus infectious. virus almost certainly stay human race become common cold virus. That's fine though--the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza became seasonal influenza kept coming back every year 1957.

If immunize people still save millions lives.

The remaining problem immunocompromised people cannot given vaccine one reason another. people get vaccinated though better them. Science liar sometimes.  Lots mouthbreathers missing point comments.

And yes, contact tracing, guy marched. ""Most home"" understatement.

In Israel 96.5% known active cases home. 

3.5% hospitals:

1% severe (life danger)

1% labeled moderate

1.5% mild cases (probably recovering patients)

And undetected cases, probably five times much, course also home work school. thats fevers work. Here's relevant part want listen 36 minutes Fauci's raspy New Yawk Yeah. Well, one problems face United States unfortunately, combination anti-science bias people are, reasons sometimes are, know, inconceivable understandable, believe science believe authority. So, see someone White House, air authority it, who's talking science, people believe that. that's unfortunate because, know, **science truth**. go evidence data, speaking amazing sometimes denial is, thing gets people anti-vaxxers, want people get vaccinated, even though data clearly indicate safety vaccines. That's really problem. think people believe people understand trust someone very, long track record always speaking truth based evidence, I've done that, said, six administrations. sixth administration. think Bay Area (the high-population part NorCal) better masks SoCal. Populist presidents worst presidents. Planning, no. epidemiologists warning us years possible pandemic. add, donated plasma recovered patients helps lot. It’s talked enough can’t understand why. Florida going ton deaths. example working. ministry said sharp increase due corrections previous days’ underreported I’m sure outdoors people mostly wearing masks, it’d fairly low risk. Indoors masks (Trump) ... high risk. Especially LOT people yelling.  nothing ... general others

You downvote want. KKKKKKKKKK stand Trump! thing people replying care facts. move onto next post continue claim China slave labour. I've rarely heard scientist talk proving something. talk proving something, keep mind scientific implications word are. 
There is, however, significant evidence wearing masks, outside, significantly safer crowds inside without masks.

Arnold not. born yet. 

Do win yet? Voluntary human testing always nets best scientific data. Sweden expressed desire obtain herd immunity Wednesday, reported Sweden 102 died past day.

No, Sweden report Wednesday 102 people died Tuesday. Sweden reported 102 new confirmed deaths due covid-19. deaths actually occurred various dates previous two weeks.

The true number deaths due covid-19 Wednesday probably around 30. It'll take two weeks get actual number.

We keep pointing you, keep ignoring it, fit doomsday propaganda, soooooooo tiring. Please get Especially weekend, dead registered.

No, *that* someone died reported typically within 24 hours. *What* someone died takes longer, go reporting systems, delays.

Note every single graph compares covid-19 death rates across countries, numbers used always rolling average reported deaths, **every single country delays reporting**. reason bitching Sweden's reporting good get know this. countries idea actual death dates are, get reported date. good idea public hoarding PPE way hoarding toilet paper. would worse public health. Americans totally fucktarded, maybe honesty would sane choice. Yeah get - refuse government order like loudly proclaiming ""we choose laws enforce enforce"". Hospitals get overwhelmed patients doctors nurses sick can't work? 

""Nobody could seen coming!"" Nope, lot duplication figures negated. Actual cases yesterday 760 today 787. http://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/5642. Tomorrow back normal guess. UV-C kills pretty much everything. good long term solution can't deployed public areas ozone might build up.  He's guy wash hands taking shit goes buffet cruise ship.

No concern anyone else. Murphy, AG, state local authorities, regular people extra vigilant enforcing rules comes staters. Simple that.  I'm going go limb say majority commenters thread read title listen 36min recording. (sadly) time completely under-counter Florida: 
- counts permanent residents. 
- pneumonia counted even though it’s result often times COVID. 
- pre existing condition, death certificate go that. 
- nursing homes delay hiding numbers. 
- prisons counted separate. 
- numbers 2 weeks behind. Duh, met American Fauci? essentially become ex-pats take United States all? love it. 49% new cases past 24 hours reported two countries: Brazil United States. Look strength prevalence natural disasters disordered weather patterns. Look rate glaciers melting. Look melting ice Mt Everest. lives lost something could contained... :( they've planning pandemic, saying?  🤔 goofy comparison. Masks prevented coronavirus back February March even though government said didn't. watch bunch cars go around around around around around around around (and around).

My home state really needs spend resources public education. thought Lex Fridman made really great video - sure would respond asked permission use twitter something. Employing person color even working closely mean cannot racist. make easy people 33k new cases? correct? Yea, like people gonna harmed supporters. doesn’t care wants ego boost. would ignore 95%

Why would elect foreigner run country? vested interest country, little personal knowledge country, really doesn’t even make sense would *want* president. one said anything even imply 31k low. guy right thing corrected inaccurate information. neutral action. think duty avoid spreading misinformation, correcting sensationalized / accidentally mistaken headline qualifies that. 

31k huge number, 49k insane even worse worst pandemic US. huge difference shifts way interpret news heavily, therefore needs correction. Simple really.

I want pandemic taken seriously, want done legitimate numbers - already speak themselves. don’t need motivated. need called hateful instigating behavior. Take somewhere else, one wants it. you, doctor agrees. says rushed vaccine good us see long term effects years. Outdoors, wearing masks, respectful distances protest people murdered versus indoors, masks, cult worship. see difference part problem. Monkeys multiple vaccines already. Phase III trials starting. ADE failed show studies numerous times whole thing. issues likely mostly around efficacy point, although may side effects like Guillain-Barre low levels incidence, influenza shot issues well, substantially less severe disease.

When discussing side effects like GBS Derek Lowe makes State national governments already talking overtly many coronavirus deaths acceptable avoid shutdowns harm economies, you’re willing make tradeoff, jump chance make one. It’s *much* better It’s me, [the engineers design build HVAC systems produced statement.

Transmission SARS-CoV-2 air sufficiently likely airborne exposure virus controlled. Changes building operations, including operation heating, ventilating, air-conditioning systems, reduce airborne exposures.

Ventilation filtration provided heating, ventilating, air-conditioning systems reduce airborne concentration SARS-CoV-2 thus risk transmission air. Unconditioned spaces cause thermal stress people may directly life threatening may also lower resistance infection. general, disabling heating, ventilating, air-conditioning systems recommended measure reduce transmission virus. course young. That’s people spread vulnerable people shut makes sense. Thanks; hard finding date decent facts abiut whats happeninng brazil; much interesting states.

FL TX also suspicious numbers excess deaths classified “pneumonia”. pretty good article terms scope, references journalistic tone. sad. get owned, move goal posts, get upset downvotes. forgot covid capable recognizing RNA people according virtue Horrifying. *Ravioli, ravioli, give proclamationi* Lol  thanks like breathe fresh air. there's people around course, I'm taking run jog hiking trail little people around. wear mask? little inconvenience, son born breathing condition excess fluid entered lungs caused problems years end. narrow larynx makes hard air enter exit lungs, mask makes particularly difficult him. supposed live small town groceries feed son? Drive hour way they're uncomfortable child's respiratory condition? 


Online delivery choice either supermarket area, CVS limited availability items help cover usual grocery spread (specfifically veggies, meat, etc.) 


It's crazy militant insulting masks even know someone's situation. Medical exceptions always okay argument someone's got real breathing condition, get Reddit salty. pray children never go son through.  might evidence random heart attacks declined. Places little covid lockdowns (the whole Denmark may best example) saw measurably reduced mortality along lack hospital visits. spending time family, commuting, clean air cities once, may fewer heart attacks. 

But nothing say NYC, saw thousands die heart attacks infected. still testing evey heart attack death covid, much less every death be. No, Korean also posted translation English. nothing say like Black Friday mixed bit Resident Evil number infected skyrocket couple days 

Sounds like idea great movie - infected Zombie shopaholics take Colombia! many churches services lately 1000+ people lol

Even morons defying state orders, managed keep 6 ft mask rule place. Granted help much Right literally decreasing new covid deaths, bud. going 7 weeks also blaming immigrants. people still mask topic? Sighs* guess that's confuses me. hard walk back? Enough data came saying masks good. recommendations changed. Studies constantly coming ""masks good"" data. people followed health agency's current recommendations, we'd way better off. Even recommendations change. college football season really needs cancelled. Exposing highly compensated adult professional players one thing.

Exactly could said feelings tacky ellipses are. Perhaps never use tacky feel be? yes..we live crazy world pro-life folks really pro-money see alot people talking ""losing lot friends"" wearing masks ""never knew people ignorant""

Nothing anyone, know times crazy right realize said ""masks nothing protect covid"" said ""everyone needs masks"" go back saying ""masks work"" times easy see wear others point matter ignorance intelligence IMO. matter media digest trust dictates believe. 

I mean look toxic media gotten. wonder confused! living appropriately circumstances hand instead leaning platitudes? virus couple months. can't say lasts lifetime dont think possible larger sports.

But NHL, NBA, MLB lot close contact players. way pull everyone go secluded location everyone isolates eachother 14 days testing done. period start playing. everyone involved must stay isolated outside world. second someone breaks isolation they're 14 days well everyone came contact with. dont see happening. 🤷🏿‍♀️  New York started trending states starting trending up...

That's accurate. know two families personally believe anything scientific virus, one father nurse. right. forgot essential workers coming back work. filled dread, would filled dread forced go theater. long choice, there's nothing dread. death rate

What's that? you’re risk life normally, let give example: 


Every year, 647,000 Americans die heart disease. That's 12,000 people every week. must flatten curve lockdown fast food restaurants high-calorie foods. deny everybody dietary choice, saving greater good. watch number heart disease cases surely drops. reopen phases. First, allow McFlurries deep-fried chicken wings Phase 1. Phase 2 permit crab rangoons yummy pasta alfredos consumed watchful eyes health inspectors make sure filling plates seconds.

Now I’m UK, saw made laugh. say bout this? Lots businesses change models, shame movie companies done Surely someone must’ve born period too? Unfortunately, people going :( I'm terrified Harris county, live. No, funny, regardless precautions took. things funny. welcome. took mine. ""The polls OANN, like better. say 105% voters say face masks 122% say Yes rallies -- MUCH better polls!""

-- also D. Trump solution look number 1, even though goverment guidlines allowing easing restirctions everything stay contact others.

A vaccine hope.  We're going look like northern Italy 10 days. never stopped quarantine damn many people state think they're Superman. feel friends medical field. wear ahego facemask funny knooooow like conservatives, NYT. Move on, need include headlines! cares? puts others risk. healthy before, quite possibly many years left live enjoy life. Enjoy kids grandkids growing up. Hahahaha going great fact whole thing actually going mind-blowing understanding science support call everyone wear masks circumstances

It absolutely there. like 100 years. Actual research definitely supports this. Research ambiguous this.

Even wearing worst fitted, thin-cloth bandanas enough reduce infection rates population double digits. decent cotton mask provide protection nearly effective surgical mask.

This first year deal respiratory infections. tons studies, lab tests practical evidence stretching back decades.

The reason appearance lack clarity we've allowed politics (and economy fears) drive conversation. conversation entirely scientific merit, would recommended masks start, like done S.Korea, 100k US people need violate patient privacy law, I'd long ago jammed two fingers nostrils local deniers *dragged* ICU tell ""breathe deep."" Fortunately, duty uphold. USA founded imo Dude rate dying low unless you’re old. Basically it’s like chicken pox point everyone healthy needs get corona recover build herd immunity protect older people yet big pushes change coming them.

Sure, make noise lose... like menu even win, double majorities.

Use brain. realize right March 30th everything pointed completely opposite. Roaring economy, lowest unemployment group including minorities administration track landslide reelection victory. lockdowns hurt EVERYONE around world. voters dont blame Pots it. fact one promoting reopening economy get people back work opponents want keep America locked indefinitely crush average person make resent Potus. happening. comes million dollar bill giving up, although apt summary impact decisions. Instead, treating virus thinking political entity which, like else democracy, banished enough people vote it. Big surprise. still virus. sure getting downvoted. Apparently people sub care inciting fear. lol obviously know less me. immune system compromised mean win battle. body expends slightly higher rate energy usual, raising internal temperature body around 2-3 extra degrees, rarely means body fails completely. death rate even 50%, measly 0.5%. said majority people get come fine. 

and missing 90% process. Lol. right, nice. twist it. point trying make, risk 70s low mean public’s perspective. Tell wear mask year I’ll groan 9 months I’ll done groaning. rescind everyone thinks you’re GD hero. say wear mask Sept 2020 realize, shit, winter gonna bad, try extend it, get second round groans whether you’re right wrong. around 200 active cases. Victoria problem states. parts control. Victoria keeps reporting new cases community spread. article, says lost family.

""I think masks good, act placebo. family personally lost coronavirus, like, wearing mask, I'm friends."" Sadly, believe many people deeply entrenched conspiracy theories death close loved one enough shake it.

probably accepting wrong would cause emotional trauma would willing shoulder Yeah I'm Austin can't believe many people freaking fuck out, ignoring requests, treat staff like shit trouble serving snacks suffocating 105 degree weather wearing masks. great still overburdens health system making higher. gives shit grandma.  ""Get 3% people die, *certainly* anyone know""

f.t.f.y. realize that, well...America kinda insane right really hard time believing fucking rally happening today. I'm Canadian, living Ontario right center leader (full disclosure, I've voted left entire life) taken cautious approach reopening feel residents (regardless politics) whole-heartedly behind approach. Finally got hair cut Monday life back normal; sit restaurants, movies, gyms, etc. us accept new normal truly wonder sort idiot would upset someone wearing mask. realize income support understand people screaming economy see create another New York/Italy things get locked again...there's way around it. weapon thing. guess people believe entire world trying pull fast one.... idk, hard imagine stupid. Please stay safe people, you. people talking second wave. first one still going strong end sight countries like US Brazil. learned this? Countries ignore science hit worst. Yeah, maybe mutated. need lots Trump events give us data mutation rates large groups. Either everything’s part giant conspiracy clear aims, Trump lying. Hmm one could  friend owns non profit charity making ppe donating people need it. Please pm know organisations USA need use cellphone tracking like political protests. bunch dumbasses taking signal you’re afraid virus. see memes time things like people storming Normandy compared guy hiding mask reads “your grandparents would ashamed you.” realize happening. can't help want see it. Norovirus (a common cause nasty virus outbreaks cruise ships) spreads easily via surfaces coronavirus does, though. Testing increases, applicable now. Yeah right, country president, still says virus hoax, faking cases. Makes totally sense. wow, cool! Good ya, Florida Keys! Thank well, hope get slammed new cases event. Per capita certainly useful measure country, people, leader’s response. number graves needed impactful people’s emotional response. say, city size “somethingtown” died country. people visualize cities, think city size hundred thousands possibly millions, dead. People care total numbers even per capita death rate positive test rate illuminating. Maybe somewhat scary uncomfortable, really crazy pretty much every respiratory illness accompanied fever including flu likely cause tachycardia. get it, please explain funny. Christian myself, whole ""We need science, God save us"" makes sad anything else. fault churchgoers understand; they've left dark like Plague.

Whether ignorance taught maliciously not, needs stop, assure nobody knowingly teaching science ""called God."" u survive infection? loved ones die it? want see loved ones die infection us haha ""You get fucking tried.""

I bet told high school diploma gave up. 18? go walk without permission, slave. Curious, steps take live?

99% Stay home go sick. rest tiny things like limiting gathering sizes temperature checks door shops. Washing hands pretty big too.

My dad lives Flint Michigan told absolute nonsense government ordered there. wonder people mad - pretty much everyone caught anyway.

I actually think major difference two countries political. Australia opposition ALP happy enough let Scomo look good pandemic long everything went well. Inversely America instantly became political issue although Reddit come pitchforks saying outsider looking in, I'm going put blame Democrats. seem intent squeezing every last drop hypocrisy situation simultaneously tanking economy. Good grief.  many people Snapchat fucking bars similar places. It’s fucking sane. sure miss able get news Onion Daily Show, back Jon Stewart era. no. science epistemology. Also elevated heart rate would spike standing up. Normal 50-60, 80-100 covid, would spike 140-160 standing up. course told that's anxiety. Trump says stop testing. think zero new tests = zero new cases. Problem solved numbers werent increasing, people blaming testing enough. numbers increased, blaming testing BS? Im saying reason numbers increased, little hypocritical consider increase testing may part reason. specific evidence closing primary schools?

You totally don’t get point decentralization. Whatever Health Agency decides, it’s regions decide. Every region close schools need to. testing slow increase certainly decentralization issue. That’s blood type too. They’re finding blood type highest risk severe Covid. Absolutely. It’s election year, it’s practically guaranteed they’ll pandering. Cooper everything “shut down,” outside restaurants salons likes, administration essentially left businesses decide whether essential not. enforcement either. say flu cancer combined kills people global warming. Lmao hopefully means LFR/cross server play almost like things magically go away stop paying attention them. would've figured? took several weeks death rates catch new case count every place significant outbreak, including NY. basic logic. disease kill people immediately. seek mental help triggers badly Yes. That’s real problem here. someone unplugged ventilator lol. That's us UK right now, taken incredibly long tail seems given us sense control virus Arizona Florida something common: they’re often extremely warm. warm. 

 
Meaning, people probably spending time indoors air conditioned spaces. no, use legs walk. Well. know Americans :(. I’m ashamed country. Still, lot people wearing masks US. Denmark, barely anyone wearing them. really understand why, ever seen Asians wearing them. no, people use legs walk. We're stupid enough unplug ventilator. need running pump Lysol lungs people risking killing support him. Crazy world live in. again, point number cases mean little except data scientists people want study trends.

what really matters death rates, climb level concerning, maybe turn chicken little. 

as hospitalizations may ticking upwards, mean much. There’s better reinforcement information therefore education, pay fine. say reformed-speeder who’s pay fair share traffic camera tickets. learn hard usually fast pay pocket. Yep, reality mess forever privatization helped getting new definitive low. embarrassing yesterday ther rallly's everywhere America, again. outdoors slows transmission, STOP transmission. people go inside eat, bars, homes older family members. politics disgusting. Yea, fuck poor! right Italy, explain drop fast here. agree, numbers dodgy last couple weeks. 
Yet, currently care exact number, Spain priorities today really hope people smart enough trigger second wave (although believe it) focus financial issues longer pandemic issues. We'll count dead later excess death, move forward (the excess death number available want make calculation) I’ve playing drinking game every time hear “Last time checked, America” That’s Brondo for. It’s got ‘lectrolites. Yea well snarky, wiesel, shit-eating grin response kinda piss off. Douche. dare strong people worries. safe. already took Clorox treatment flashlight asses. stable. genius. comes virus, I'm going catch it, either want mild case want kill me. want get hospitalized spend next decade plus paying medical bills. town named beach doesn’t mean cases coming beach itself. 

Myrtle Beach drinking town. apparently looking exist seem forgotten COVID around half year. 

Evidence damage heart lungs long term damage. ""Because I'm afraid job, everyone accommodate fears."" Pretty sure movie critic pandemic less dangerous roofer. Well give away..... Well guess ok since infrastructure functional. Hmmmm let's see mass ""fact checking"" webpage date changing via social media, Google finished installing voluntary (for now) covid-19 tracking functionality millions American chips oops mean cell phones. Add race war token cities police ""defunded"" prove bad things long whole nation begging police real surveillance..... Damn I'm tripping must long nights trying cancel Facebook account remove covid19 tracking app lol Basically Drumph supporters Lab Rats. guess call Post Modern Tragedy? Yeah ain't gonna happen reasonable Ya, didn’t chance stance masks April 3rd... that, said masks don’t really work don’t really need them. That's time frame fired data scientist it? delay updating back filling data always appear downward trend. Whether design unknown use data reason push forward either ignorant intentional. Also, dont think little suspicious deaths never really get much 50 day? power fiber optic cables. wait...""Nobody could seen coming..."" know dead person went rally? common type survey decide answer question questions online. much less credence self-selected, unweighted samples less trustworthy. Brigading thing online polling like Reddit. Wholeheartedly agree. recent article local university reopening fall said campus home 10,000 students every state around world, one many reopening fall almost entirely campus classes. Well, really French, used live Netherlands Belgium Spain, really believe Spain handle pandemic better countries. explain Netherlands cases knowing everybody still going out, definitely spinning narrative favor country. perfect, gladly giving Spanish government benefit doubt assure working urgent matters counting every day many people died wow sensitive much described *exact* reason Bill Nye made TV show...in 90s. almost 30 years later fighting thing. Liberal southern standards... China relaxed face mask requirements Beijing [Beijing makes India serious continuous spiking covid cases rise expecting 500,000 end month.

Prepare continuous lockdown. initial spread suppressed whereas still rolling USA. first one still going strong end sight countries like US Brazil.

Just wait. months, certain political campaign arguing ""we better everyone else, second waves didn't!"" Ok, that's frightening. obvious shop. Tan lines look like Fuck hospitality. goes Nordrhein-Westfalen / North Rhine-Westphalia delivered number COVID cases. Seriously, think realized labeled pandemic. Fine work Landline bias problem polls ten years ago techniques evolved. Apprently people best meat. Can't wait next White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing brought Umbrella Corporation.

Oooof.  wife likes goats. face shields made plastic I've seen old folks using (similar ones use hospitals). \*does\* strap around top head hold touch front face. Maybe brother could get one those? hope find way get house. many people getting multiple tests. Especially healthcare workers.

America locked later, short time reopened everything swiftly numbers fully control.

For comparison, UK, worst performing European country virus, rolling average 50 deaths day now, reopened everything lot concern opened quickly.

Unless I’m wrong, please tell am. That's true, Sweden healthcare system absolutely terrible, started privatised.  doesn’t get dumber like picturing Arnold yelling, “now wear mask idiot!” Tegnell definitely wrong person handle emergency. 
 
Sweden got unlucky wrong people charge started. Holy fuck horrible. It’s honestly pathetic embarrassing people actually follow ticking guidelines pandemic say freedoms. right trace test me. eat it, virus actually specific color? yes, color Corona virus? Focusing percentage people testing positive seems pointless anyways. one point, even tested everyone country once, would've 0%. takes one person potentially ravage entire country given enough time. got thousands active cases walking around country (which do), state low positive rate today means nothing trouble interstate car ride plane flight away. guess depends grow US lot states teach both. look metric every day food items measurement devices also metric. Really main area included road signs. guess putting metric parentheses would make distance signs confusing cluttered.

It's joke, man. patients going back near normal levels medical care 

I seen data says ""patients going back near normal levels medical care"".

Tell me, exactly generally want do, that's physically impossible small changes... hope there's us side. 

There's unsurprisingly large number people always support genocide president literally killing people get re-elected. realize college football players get paid right?........ places like Texas, Florida, Arizona... definitely. People gathering outside drinks. hot that. tighter enclosed places misters air conditioning. Sure, us didn't, meant us nation. Thinking one side right wrong short sided. problem America. become us vs. them. parties problems. paint entire party broad brush close minded counter productive. Uhh Texas literally sending people back work. governor says don’t need wear facemasks. They’re posting record case numbers...

Our president completely unnecessary rally Tulsa without requiring attendees wear facemasks.  would ask ventilation system. obviously hoax, one perhaps greatest hoaxes history, many people saying everybody knows it.......... didn’t. Electoral college did.  Dont tell Karen. quite. cardiac events actually covid19 deaths, government finds easier hide death toll labeling cardiac arrests.

yeah certainly people died go hospitals, we're talking excess cardiac arrests, know vast majority people dying virus. trolling, thank you. history tells us people see real heroes, protecting weak innocent. 

This makes people refusing wear masks cowards. 

I like way think. kinda stupid, well. Reason number 375 I'm moving another country. still hear many people saying something along lines ""I'm afraid getting sick.""

The answer yes, knowing toll cop treatment blacks many others(who benefit well). Today (Friday) much worse too, 180,000 new cases sound little excited this. Immunity zero one. intermediate types, still get slightly sick still infect others, perhaps lower rate. best case producing enough neutralizing antibodies prevent infection. producing memory B cells well robust cell response far better nothing.

Sweden minimum 7% population (700 000) antibodies SARS-CoV-2, likely twice since samples collected weeks ago, 5000 reported deaths (updated daily basis close match excess mortality). puts mortality sure less 0.8%, likely less 0.4%. 

The severity infection also naturally go infectivity goes up. That's last years SARS became pandemic 2002 MERS didn't. infects everyone become even less deadly. 

The number people dying flu dropped considerably since Covid-19 pandemics started. less risk group, can't die twice...

Mark day: today first day someone’s mind actually changed Reddit “argument”. true, basic sense *of course masks protective, even little* we’ve known ages, straight-up lied. It’s hard walk back mess they’ve made I’m split logic different paths try merge back together - makes sense.

As *why*, think it’s things. 

1) Trump’s failure leadership due self-serving priorities subject matter incompetence perpetuated lack deference experts lack courage among experts put careers line *telling emperor wears clothes” speak.

I know sounds like hyper-partisan finger-pointing, real reasons initial denial-downplay-deflect-divide response major factor got point. reportedly angry CDC Dr Messonnier’s 2/25 telebriefing - one first US official come say loudly clearly “be prepared significant disruptions daily lives”. disapproval clear style content comments briefings days-weeks follow. personally watched live. flying back India time telebriefing. market tanking news got back, seems clear priorities always re-election economic prosperity public health concerns. 

I also don’t think actually understands basic science. Early on, recorded asking Dr Fauci “really good flu vaccine” would prevent COVID. touted Hydroxychloroquine potential “miracle” cure wayyyyy prematurely. already watching number large hospitals following advice ID chiefs including “potential” treatment. know turned out: HCQ became hyper-partisan issue loads controversy due poor data quality eventually University Minnesota’s large RCT proved (for me) helpful, even given early. bad. hopes up, despite political/media bickering. 

Finally, haven’t seen remarkable WH presser Trump floats injecting/ingesting sanitizer *somehow* treating insides UV light, gotta see yourself. wasn’t joking. wasn’t sarcasm. incompetence + arrogance full display POTUS watched podium land. Dr. Brix, though might fault advocating sanity vs Trump crisis, seemed diplomatic best walk wayyyyy back. It’s “gotcha” sound bite. whole presser nationally embarrassing. 

All might rendered harmless task force, governors public health officials general ignored Trump done right thing anyway, *is* POTUS. set tone, pushed messaging past everyone else, degree appeasement adherence still trying actual jobs. 

2) PPE shortages scared shit everyone. 

This helped justify, many minds, narrative “masks don’t help public” right start. won’t get *why* didn’t enough PPE, could rapidly addressed problem federal intervention, federal intervention *did* get was, many cases, counterproductive. Maybe see #1 that, use imagination I’d say Jared Kushner.

3) Cloth masks weren’t something CDC prepared offer guidance on. 

Have ever weighed use DIY masks before? know seems obvious help, least little, don’t think data support option, don’t think they’d considered we’d ever caught ill-prepared strapping bandana faces every American would ever necessary recommend. *wasn’t thing*. seemed driven reports people HCW’s countries it, got picked US HCW’s, crafty friends/families, eventually every home-isolating concerned citizen sewing machine. took really fast without official comment CDC until, eventually, finally went it. recommended cloth masks beginning way protect people *and* preserve resources HCW’s, might lied masks, might conversation.

3) People panicked. 

The vast majority public really need stockpile N95 masks go get groceries every week two. personally think everyone few, especially live wildfire country, stockpile. whole rush private PPE supplies definitely made things worse, helped justify initial lie masks necessary counter scared uneducated public thought seeking healthcare already-broken utterly unprepared healthcare system. 

4) Surgical masks really aren’t designed great protection tiny viruses. 

Sure, use contact isolation hospitals, N95’s using. Even OR, masks really protecting surgical field, surgeon, except sprays splashes bodily fluids, that’s different protection aerosols fine virus-laden droplets. stated, doesn’t excuse officials lying stating aren’t helpful necessary, make easier twist truth suit needs, causing lot public confusion wear, wear it, wear it, wear it, etc... basic public (and presidential) education would gone long way toward mitigating spread fear COVID. 

So anyway, reasons think lied masks get-go. political standpoint, think would helpful Trump manned-up accepted responsibility underprepared slow (if obstructive) acknowledge respond incoming threat. It’s helpful deflect blame China, WHO, anyone else. Let’s get shit together deal responsibly. public health standpoint, task force officials absolutely fault allowing poor leadership break integrity. KNEW better, even POTUS not. public responsibility standpoint, citizens educate right thing other. right now, seem struggling simple concept wearing fucking mask motherfucking pandemic. 

/rant point complaining putting life hold neglecting look facts.

If die, life over. get someone sick care about, might wish dead.

If really care life future, take necessary precautions today protect chances brighter tomorrow.

This called maturity. reading contact traced studies outbreaks, I'd agree - surfaces proven ALL. fact, even circumstantial evidence severely lacking. viral particles found surfaces. whether they're active, many, exactly millions people moved respiratory tract... they're still working that. day now. can't produce artificial plasma? confusing lockdowns social distancing. 

Lockdowns temporary meant keep hospitals overwhelmed. 

Social distancing temporary nothing hospital capacity. Stay 6 feet apart people live with. Period. masks. Wear them. Period.  know think better proof American health care system broken. real question take CA long institute mandatory masks? expect able re-open activities virus vanish? Masks mandatory opening started. There's actually lot contact tracing, Trump can't take credit though mostly done states, discussed pay attention federal news doubt that. Live stream went indoors event center. seen handful mask wearers. wish one gets sick science saying otherwise. reason thought people would little responsible especially around 1,000s randoms one knows. September correct J&amp;J's. Moderna's kicking phase 3 next month. live Ann Arbor. Problem solved worse it’s indoors, social distancing, masks, everyone getting close meet greet, boisterous chanting. 

Also, anything witness **today** won’t noticeable impact week two weeks, hospitalizations deaths occurring three four weeks later. true damage NYC gatherings and/or rally won’t felt time. gotten second base yet?!? That’s part I’m excited for! BOO🐝S!!! That's asked purpose threads are.

Normal ICU capacity rates irrelevant pandemic beds filled quickly (see NY).

So ""just flu"" apparently agree post this?

I live area 90 percent people ""it's hoax"" mode information like reinforces belief type conspiracy nothing worry ICU's always near capacity. go nothing mitigate threat (no mask, going bars, etc)

If live area increasing hospitalizations lead need ICU beds already near capacity (for whatever reason) see good reason concerned I, family friends may need one beds. God, facts simple minded. JFC, keep putting lipstick pig. Use glory hole? maybe start smoking too. I'm rural northern Michigan. large right wing population went protests Lansing. two weeks protest cases spiked. around 130 cases keep coming. county college 20 cases. Education makes big difference Coronavirus don’t exist none don’t pay attention it. Same. sub required reading Americans 15 mins day. doesn’t keep home wearing mask go out, nothing will. feel hard time virus. So, many people struggling recover even months later. would anyone wear mask protect friends family least knew even 5% virus capable of? Drives crazy think it. particular RT R_t refers retransmission rate. site nothing Russia Today. r/woooosh Thousands people work, cascading financial disaster higher ed felt years line.

You can’t really compare pandemic war, war actually stimulates economy. also much industry built around college sports 1945 go, lustigkurre. Florida check point you’re coming New York quarantine 14 days come in. think that's valid excuse justification, even reasonable explanation.

Shocker finally kill narrative? two weeks since protests started seen significant increase states largest protests occurred, including Minnesota, Illinois, New York.

There several problems argument:

1) protests secure everywhere. protests nearly everyone wearing masks people keeping distance, others such.

2) states already high fatality rate passed initial peak. 3 states mentioned started decrease peak moment protests started. judge numbers alone, main difference would see peak would go fast. 

3) Many states mentioned saw rapid increase 3 weeks protesting, supporting narrative want kill. 

4) Everyone biased agrees protests make situation worse COVID. agree protests mean Nothing ever make take seriously, including loss loved ones. mean, test positive sure it. even test negative, show symptoms assume got false negative I'm one claimed specific number, articles this: [Estimates excess deaths pandemic show underreporting Covid-19 Keep believing narrative.. 

Here's data. He's completely wrong. people got paid protest. Open masks open ICU beds. inevitable... Daylight ain’t dam thing protesters aren’t wearing masks packed like couple sardines. Well, find working vaccine, could share data rest world produce own? Sane humans tell crazy human crazy thing bad idea. News 11.

""Hey, pay us full freight tiny seat. No, peanuts more. Also, wear sweat generator whole flight. worry kids sick people wearing them, we're fine that. 

Oh sorry, we're going need stow small bag brought beneath plane, couple 3 kids (not wearing masks) filled overhead compartment. Thanks flying Delta piece garbage."" Probably around 80. That's developed nations US states. You’re welcome. think ok hurt people reason guess what? apparently need told piece shit. yes, yes mean summer weather weaken shit everyone indoors cool AC. 80. 21.9% 8% 70. Compare diseases previously freaked (measles, instance, death rate 0.001%)...if 10-40 yrs old death rate covid know WHO, CDC, Fauci, Surgeron General various studies say wear mask

No don't. Fauci speaks sides mouth. said needed earlier. Hong Kong another outbreak?  

At present time, widespread use masks everywhere supported high-quality scientific evidence, potential benefits harms consider.

However, settings may possible keep physical distancing use mask could helpful provide barrier limit spread potentially infectious droplets someone infected. addition, evidence suggests infected people without showing symptoms may able transmit virus others.

For reason, advises governments encourage use non-medical fabric masks, act barrier prevent spread virus wearer others many cases COVID-19, people general public physical distancing least 1 metre possible – as, public transport, shops confined crowded environments.

It important note masks used part comprehensive strategy. Masks protect COVID-19. People also clean hands frequently maintain distance least 1 metre others. Wear fucking mask, wash fucking hands. Jesus christ. selfish people refuse wear masks get deprioritized medical resources tight? reason doesn’t work, try fear. heard lot stories country didnt lock would countless victims flooded hospitals.

That didnt really happen Sweden. mean .. *best* country, better several countries hard lockdowns.

And like many countries totally screwed pooch regarding seniors care, even larger normal percentage Swedens dead 80 years old.

It would interesting see happens country good protection seniors lockdown.

I guess that's Japan? dont wear mask, selfish, ignorant both. option. cares? colorado, near Denver, I'm seeing many masks all. I'm work, customers routinely make fun gloves masks too. 

I cant help wonder stats came one taking covid seriously all. real issue ICU air conditioning hot ass Indian summer. Hospitals needs upgraded. got hospitals falsifying lower numbers, falsifying higher numbers question? 🤔 Highly fascinating topic lead COVID numbers globally. sayin. r/nottheonion Fuck off, racist, [Start still failed 80% time officially tested.

So, dropping make difference average flight Indonesia.  Tell never answer unknown calls. usually want money. Maybe total blank virus protests annoying... needed bigger mug tears make difference? Hospital capacity pretty damn important part public health considerations here, asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic people need hospital. Truth is, medics failed US.

I advocate Chiropractic because, healthier system yielding better results. Bro. Yes is. sucks man. Hugs Buenos Aires dont want get sick No, wearing mask won’t protect you. average corona virus .125 microns. N95 mask filters .30 microns.

You: ""no reason, that's clever actually science empathy mean nothing."" seem think author talking everyone disagree with, you, don'tcha? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm

Did read PDF? Fauci New York shouted roof tops dismissed red states. US leaders warned daily death toll New York climbed 24K stable genius nothing help sound alarm chance. He's holding rally 40K people willingly going. Crowded. Together. Indoors. 

Spring breaks allowed continue DeSantis laughed Cuomo. red states take seriously hurts precious 'freedom."" much warning looking for? increases test swab antibody tests? lot articles don’t really say there’s increased infections based swab antibody tests. Maybe there’s also increase antibody tests people recovered less severe even asymptotic one point? wondering aside correlating increased infection rates hospitalization rates. No, virus infect BLM protestors. That's known thing. skips them. 

Get woke dude. Profit almost hard comprehend stupid is. OBVIOUSLY testing means numbers increase. don’t want accept reality faced with, dumb far enough “makes sense” don’t care numbers human lives. disproportionate number lives black brown people. Fuck Donald Trump.  It’s hard amount universal ignorance - - that’s going completely novel virus. don’t amount information necessary make informed decisions. think keeping ourselves, families, vulnerable members population safe (via masks, washing hands, following generally advised social distancing guidelines) seems like obvious choice, either information everyone goes back normal. There's literally possible way know covid lung scarring heart damage return normal 3 months Demonizing experts imperfect new skepticism. Useless bureaucracy best. barber shop breaking records like Olympics... Flalabamida? said [assholes like making killing selling anti-mask propaganda Fox News crowd. O'm serious, asshole ""book"" near top Amazon's best seller list. ""I never liked Fox much."" - - D. Trump. Obviously.

The cat bag here. 

Many places never really shut begin places open to, least, extent now.

But, now, act protests end hundreds years systematic inequity counterproductive spread virus when, reality, very, small fraction spreading, disingenuous.

It’s revisionist history (from certain group) fill agenda kill two birds one stone:

1) justify systematic inequality. 
2) Act lack leadership pandemic, first place, isn’t responsible 99% problem. think data bears (although I'd curious see read paper talking risk factors UK ICU data. Take look page 11, chart risk factors. certainly couple comorbidities increase risk, age much much larger determining factor anything else (also note risk factor younger people low chart left). care, bottomless mimosas important geezers. can't them, purpose life? else would possibly spend time? MAGA masks. Someone mentioned thread, hugely missed opportunity good also self-tagging stupid.

Shhhh! cant say that! upsetting coronavirus fanbase quite possibly.... doctors know permanent lung kidney damage looks like? name humanity?
Lead example.  got empirical evidence increased respiratory infections illnesses. study.  penetration cloth masks particles almost 97% compared medical masks 44%.

And include misuse face touching. legit healthcare workers. someone ask wanted car pool said they'd wear mask. 70 year old mom got hair done wore mask. question - one?

No. Neither position human transfor infection rates exists. understand thought cloth masks. think shit much misuse face touching see. I've watched people go doors grab inside masks pull up. wear mask fine stop touching face. higher number infected people, struggle long term effekt illness. Rehabilitation hospitalized covid19 patient may take least half year om many cases. Lots og people never return normal life

Do numbers showing many people suffer long-term effects Covid? pft. people walking around think immune system failing people, we're going catch things we've inside nothing boosts immune system (the discussion boosted immune system would well heads...(hashimotos, cytokine storms...etc) I've thinking that, trying get kind testing diagnosis doctors pretty much impossible. terrible knees, wrists, back explanation why. early 20s, lost ability stand walk 5 minutes without wearing knee braces constantly. lost ability digest foods severe IBS I've ever heard anybody having. kinda think related, particularly sure given looking answers spending thousands dollars going specialists. heart racing feeling dizzy standing hot shower annoying sure, life altering enough pursue answers point. entirely sensible. r/Masks4All surpassed r/Masks subs... might Russian trolls instead I'd agree except case willingly putting risk willingly putting others risk.

The virus show already it. antibody test could possibly show it.

Would try discussion both. Yeah cooperation leadership level. Government jobs need set like civilian. employment fired reason. homelessness? lack housing. solve homelessness? giving people poverty? lack money resources. solve poverty? giving people enough money longer qualify poor.

Very illuminating. read articles I’ll reply directly below. pressing question this: would biggest downsides program, might go issue isn’t complexity problem live system requires poverty homelessness. live society requires certain level unemployment.

Can point society people homelessness poverty midst? ask since seem framing poverty homelessness result particularities US. that’s case, assume look societies don’t share peculiarities see eradication say uniquely US caused issues. hyperbolic. You’re talking someone helped found dozen organizations pilot programs this.

That’s commendable I’m glad you’ve done that. need people like you. I’ve worked impoverished multiple countries don’t resumé it’s issue near dear heart too. 

I still stand statement you’re hyperbolic, agree disagree move important topics. House recess. Senate be. Neither solving this. States cannot without financial assistance federal government.

This sounds like temporary issue - recess permanent mean issues poverty homelessness talked members right moment. doesn’t address regional local governments working issues recess. 

Again, issue original stance left room discussion - saying zero care people doesn’t pass sniff test. took long?? state it’s safe go now. there’s reason we’re phase 2. hospitalizations lowest they’ve since early april we’ve positive rate around 5% fo 2 weeks Florida would better steep, progressive state income tax instead regressive sales taxes that'd sensible.

Kiwi living conspiracy land. read article internet ad plastered front it. fuckers leave alone also. think grossly misunderstand Florida Real talk, I'm sure help point calling ”mild” inconvenience. struggle pretty hard reasons grocery shopping becomes really really difficult I'm remind take deep calm breaths. forget stupid things can't basic math. 

Grocery delivery option live.

I also used lip reading living masked reality is... Exhausting. Comprehending anyone elses words LITERALLY feeling like I'm fighting air absolute brain destroying issue. 

Im giant, two pack day smoker either. 30 years old work physical field. smoke cigars year. 

That said, put fucking mask anyway. buck deal it. get truck, put mask, sanatize hands phone, touch face reason till I'm done. 

My point feel bad nonsense.... Just, polarize issue belittle people's struggles.  mob mentality ideas unpopular, unpopular violent mob    really Trump. LGBTQ ""re-claimed"" symbol 70s positive identity something originally meant shame (which understatement Holocaust). show confidence, proudness, resistance. Similar LGBTQ community use word faggot, dyke, (and arguably FAR less offensive modern times) queer. 

You're necessarily wrong, trying make comparison LGBTQ's uses Trump's campaign uses, see it. gave literally context reason. there. trying reclaim? Republicans Conservatives shamed, trying make positive situation? fact, contextual reason put triangle there. Saying ""Hey, guys I'm Nazi!"" would've far context saying ""It's important every American comes together."" *ATM* got super-depression. think I’m starting lack empathy. supper somethings aren’t they? couple times month sure, every 3/4 days? That's way necessary. .26 IFR cold hard evidence? Reddit full dry vaginas. I’m horrified everyone I’m talking still planing vacations. Ten hour drive Myrtle Beach. 10 hour drive Pensacola. places Florida, California, etc. Even family Florida right wedding. sure, sample size useful metric people processed data competent trustworthy. Things like multicollinearity, VIF scores, homoscedasticity etc also places polls numbers become useless. 

I finished bachelor's sociology, going knew people pull fuckery statistics, now, three years later, trust statistic peer reviewed. point feels like there's going healthy people people alive second wave lot weaker impact, unless countries like UK,france,usa high tourist locations start opening  said institution answer government; That’s, know, said institution inherently rotten. india people world they’re broke huge numbers expected, sad say fault passively accepting something without questioning it. That’s one way get people board process: “surveillance”. Already huge portion America poo pooing notion contact tracing. need better advertising team. Yeah think that's correct. real lack decisive leadership divided culture. Shouldve never locked first place werent gonna follow through. plague wont go away. year without Super Bowl feel weird. worst thing would probably people crying it. least would prevent us getting super expensive post-Covid commercials. Doritos would probably make something funny situation though. Really? governor says 'no way' we'll go back lockdowns. Would 2.2 million strong leader. don’t think understand dehumanizing means. 

We’re here. Shaming folks wearing mask pandemic community service I’m advocating let run rampant think constant doom mongering amongst people cause issues anxiety mental health risk virus poses them.

If take children - chance getting hit lightening adverse reaction covid. 

We could hit bus anytime cross road. I’m asking people look data tells us. *shitparade would believe but, know hospitals serve. I'm not, Tony! [Also eyes main point entry Coronavirus. Construction. trade really . Theyre high demand here. Imo polls include sample size. like informative website uses BAT, tipped. covidly lists spain #2 daily death count.. hell happened ? we're still mask debate... r/Masks4All ! Governor Cooper three weeks ago wearing mask following social playing around, r/Masks4All we're screwed! Indoors VS outdoors seems make difference. think outlet would blocked locked prevent exactly this. thing stops dying flimsy plug wall? Hope Bolsanaro types eventually get r/Masks4All horrifying talking think hoax. mean, talking dying, really want say ""just"" already are, government covering ""Pneumonia"" deaths quadrupled, there's clear effort hide COVID deaths Mother russia lies may eligible compensation.

lol, hat r/Masks4All!  What’s experience amount to? dunno... 9.8 million deaths, he'd probably know somebody... Lol really need participation trophy trying stay alive Possible. They're trying looking grim. do, happens teams start seeing players go positive, coaches, referees, etc. coaches healthy either. going suck playoff hunt star player covid-19 14 days more. seen one occasion someone post “thank god virus done!” never realized lived around many idiots. used really love living here. wish somewhere else LOL Unfortunately issue Canada health authorities pushing masks long least live there’s still push wear mention face coverings may help. Otherwise it’s handled pretty well point feels incongruous point. Well, no. know masks effective (sure might help like percent), even surgeons know prevent droplets viruses transmitting unless n95s (which stop 95%, hence name). wearing facemasks like surgeons, placate eachother. Masks prevent grandmother dying, nursing home hit regardless. keep anyone getting ill. way combat illness bolster immune system immunostimulants. way. cannot wait til science catches common sense. present time, widespread use masks everywhere supported high-quality scientific evidence, potential benefits harms consider. sure, depending study for, case ""news value"", subsamples sample small hell. I've seen studies type subsamples low 15 still claimed validity.

But again, depends for, 15 subsample obviously problematic medicine something. I'm gonna call bullshit one. I'm Boise one wearing masks inside out. Two weeks ago last phase opened bars week later tracing went back 6 bars. Week 4 bars got traced bar owners complained got singled health department. try make customers wear masks lose business guarantee everything back usual. Ever since bars popped social distancing businesses, one enforcing it, people give fuck anymore.

Funny thing county mayor never shut bars open entire time. havent going much besides usual grocery run things look like pandemic exist.

As business owner understand feel since I'm small pub shit getting rough ends. want get people sick I'd also like funds keep roof head. figure many 4th July hot heavy even superspread... even science bruh. Equifinality. article says ""hundreds loggers, land grabbers, ranchers colonists operating illegally within borders."" wish virus would give us something useful like spider sense x-ray vision. well we're reaching turning point . countries keep control control . wont giving trying. Christmas 2020 going really silent sad.  level denial though...""It time..."" It’s dumbest country earth right now, ahead Brazil NK. They’ve ruined prestige lost respect ones *proud* idiots.

Frankly it’s lost cause. taken time read anything said, understood point problem subsequent risk much greater ireland. pretending people understand acting hysterical moronic. Imagine playing plague app countries started open back air travel part way through.. talk easy mode. known early March. Many viral infections, severe, cause long term damage surprising. real question percentage infected? 5%? 40%? comment must higher. Air coolers spread moist cool mists air, preferred areas dry heat. would bet unwelcome Corona ward. deaths due virus becoming previlent reaches old infirm populations.

Its totally reasonable think Covid, mostly mild young adults, could go undetected infected someone interacting old people. could theres lot spreaders would circulating contact lot others (young workers) noticed. Many dont know infected dont develop symtoms severe enough warrent doctors visit.

We blind canaries coalmine started dying then, yes, spread almost fourth population.

It didnt get *bad bad* hit nursing hones. Oh God gonna deal white immigrants🤣 Thank awesome taking care her. I'm sorry still here. \*Hugs\* Joe Rogan v Gov. Cooper Fight Island coming soon. Dismayland  Sonce immunity likely short term, need vaccinate everyone earth one time virus place go dies off. slow, always popping somewhere. Yes chance quite low. hold cans alive, or...?  doubt he's concious.

And whole ""fighting"" language stupid, actually offensive, whether we're talking Covid-19 cancer whatever.

The way body responds illness absolutely zero attitude mental strength moral fiber, etc. sensationalist headline. Basically 2 NZ citizens returned went funeral, untested, breach govts strict standards (the fault seems lay 2 women government department charge border quarantine). Hopefully cases within NZ result able controlled point. right think article cracked. close eyes, problems go away, know? close friend mine, (seemingly) So; government really truly compassionate entity made exceptionally kind hearted, caring, trustworthy people? guys sure full attention now..... fact gets upset people claiming 'true patriots' could give damn fellow Americans die. irony hypocrisy unbearable. really. New deaths went 7 day average 40s April 30s June. significant. fact, past 30 days, plateauing moving much either direction. “...Prompting scientists rename ‘T-Virus’” Misread first comment thread. bad article WWI course high numbers Latino cases make large portion population whys every article spin things like white people devil? sick tired it. still rely amount statistically relevant amount people age group begin polled? terms living days stolen, much less misleading way measure deadliness something, isn’t even deadly auto accidents.

In fact, even let run free pursued herd immunity strategy got two years, still wouldn’t deadly even auto accidents terms living days stolen. yet seem happy assume risks even post trivial benefits like going ice cream, would never tolerate shutdown driving. lungs Floridian here, I’m f*cking mad governor idly sitting letting take place pointing fingers. hard make mask mandate?? Exactly. soon area hits severe cases capacity, deaths skyrocket people try nurse loved ones disease. risk exponential growth going every day deniers flout science. still see idiots “recall whitmer” signs. Kind odd marvel movies like dire warning didnt bother recognize....and actually served herald sorts, im still waiting “we win” part happen..... important see, important spin it. Trump started 4 years bashing china, able spin batteriological retaliation china saying things like ""with great tariff war china obtained record employment great economy, chinese pissed infected us virus damage us"" he'll able put fuel fire dumb american patriotic spirit gain even consense next election.  I'm glad there's expiration date life. want see shit headed, honestly can't believe people bringing children fucking mess.  

Yes, still beautiful good days, even sun shining getting increasingly difficult think Western civilization circling drain. Well, course. people charge pretend care work keep people safe. I've surprised much Russians flooded fort Lauderdale area. last October saw guy beach looked like could Grand theft Auto. Speedo, gold chain, ponytail, accent go it. 

He talking phone Russians buying town. Buying AirBNB's going fort Lauderdale. 

I agree however Ft. Lauderdale Miami area entirely different world central/North Florida. India, Water room coolers common. It’s India. won’t get upgraded. Cudjoe couple cases far. help anyway, inbox mean, lots things kill really old people. flu, example... mean one little deadly guess but.. old people die eventually, lot time infectious disease normally deadly unless super old. German government estimates 70% people infected so...
Also, I'm talking asymptomatic cases well, based number population tests done Italy Germany. lingering long term effects? delay, getting sick today get really bad weeks also lot people already died, people still alive bit stronger. supporters aren’t exactly healthiest bunch people. also tend older... Maybe it’s average lot higher used perform much better, moms teacher knows data state lot better rando Internet. UK, Spain, Belgium, Italy. Well 2 week holiday coom place better reward 2 hour resraurant trip? naturally, risk it?

Also 100.000 people died plane crashes 3 months, people would take plane. planew crashing much, people would use them. would rather bump paycheck statue. sayin Solar battery tech meet needs. Aw fuck exactly like trying feed child veggies. Like soon tell good it, immediately becomes thing fight tooth nail. OP isn’t sure difference cooler air conditioning unit Welp, looks like restarting practicum anytime soon... I’ve concern. far, it’s 3 weeks &amp; MN (where started) new infections trending downwards. good start, next week two telling. Hopefully continues downward trend. shows majority people wearing masks &amp; outside doesn’t cause rapid spreading. understand post. Please explain. still made laugh Remember shocking 200,000 number couple months ago? feel like people would shrug headline. It’s denial goes fact evidence-based reality, regardless saying it. college education goes long way. "" fighting democratic institutions""

FTFY Keep opening clubs, bars gyms US reach 100k+ cases per day quite soon. Trump close activities lock everyone home months Italy countries. now

he good economic purposes, really shitty comes foreign policy generally behaving like cares people leading....

Hes single use. one trick pony. One side coin need both....

Good making money, shitty serving public, hes narcissist...

Lets hope dont vote psychopath next....Trump close enough wanna see.... Americans stopped trusting experts protected CCP infected whole world. 

Where experts protests happening???

Where experts governors states sent sick senior citizens nursing homes???

Where experts governors lived ""Do say, do""??? lol, hyped? asymptomatic / presymptomatic people still infect others, lead hospitalizations. public health standpoint they're still important, can't dismiss they're still vectors viral passage. exponential growth, much contribute it. can't like ""ah people complaining, they're asymptomatic anyway"" NJ too.  not. people shamed it, they're gonna wear one. stubbornness. read whole thread, nothing insults - expect come side calling stupid? still blame Jon Stewart 2016 election.  company studied Cape Canaveral last week May found 85 cases time 3 confirmed cases. lot people virus numbers suggest. want catch treat everyone infectious. give crap freedoms. care everyone safe. Congrats Maricopa! Yes, reported cases confirmed testing. real numbers much higher we'll never know true extent due corrupt leaders governments covering ineptitude. Same. parents elderly mom obese. haven’t able see months. know people like common thread love Trump know end. trunp thinks Corona also believe Corona sad can't set political ideologies aside see what's really going claiming far-left radicals entered rally spread COVID purpose 

i wish limits that. surprised tweet tune ""antifa terrorists spread virus beautiful rally proud americans, equivalent terrorist batteriological attack"" 

DR. DEBORAH BIRX: So, think country we've taken liberal approach mortality...

There countries preexisting condition let's say virus caused go ICU heart kidney problem countries recording heart issue kidney issue COVID-19 death....the intent right someone dies COVID-19 counting COVID-19 death. Yeah, I’m seeing lot tourists live. even saw month ago, why? don’t get lets say happens. get sick, recover, point virus slips again.

Do get sick shorter less severe time virus get hugged death wrecks havoc? 6 weeks? long think takes kill people? would way much work trump cronies. They’re minimal effort crew. They're marking milestones. useless, helps governments agencies change plans clear justifications. science communication channel masses, work governments, agencies, large institutions. whole ""people confused WHO"" new people usually pay attention WHO; maybe hear 1-2 things year news piece report something.  Boomer exclamation marks women, trite.  batteries things vent continue run sound alarm showing main power disconnected? Relatively speaking, California yet much population Yeah, get annoyed friends say “it’s like bad flu”. Noooo, killed people yearly flu total past 100 years. since Spanish Flu. It’s “bad flu” it’s worse that. scientist fired skew numbers, fired went ahead released actual numbers, yes there's cover need doubt Yes. Also, lot protesters wearing masks. protest march near house last week, saw lots people wearing masks keeping distance others. outdoor event people wear masks less dangerous indoor event crowd together don’t wear masks. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Source: 


Speed 300%. see going grow. question much. True, higher estimates say 60% will, that’s still 100,000 dead. 


I hate way we’ve desensitized numbers. 


That’s 100,000 people ffs. 100,000 mothers grandmothers, fathers, friends, wives husbands, people *loved*. include beach, boating? get list people signed up. knowing actually attended. Seating first come first serve lot shenanigans people signing tickets. heard trump bought virus China get rid enough elderly dismantle social security. sure believe it, I’ve heard several times people different social circles. Yeah, said later comment below. mostly agree. definitely depends they're located though. That's said unless people partying mostly white feel comfortable it. know would crushed someone died due choice made.

However, unified tough people quite literally declaring world fun important society's health overall. intolerant people decisions actually put *countless* lives danger. heart message trying put there. really bad math need explained you? Even 1k day two months, that's 60k people.  even 1% population New York. nothing say response actual statistics. increase covid+ cases obviously people risk category. understand that? Yesterday saw map covid spikes state. ~20 states whose numbers seen significant spike wouldn’t know it, ~16 states Trump 2016. It’s like idiots taking cues covid White House definitely getting ducked it. Hopefully realize wtf going it’s late. Cmon guys flu let testing, numbers much higher. Probably meant courtesans. think mindset wearing masks was. I'm reflecting mindset reality. AZ.

Just example. 100 tests taken 6% positive rate would 6 positives. 1,000 tests given 6%, would 60 positives. 1,000 tests 30 positive, 3%, 6 6% would reasonable observation. However positive % also increasing, indicative results spread, testing. That’s favored song among Right all. would “God Bless America.”  low voter turnout (55%), wasn’t really majority. We’re maggots eating corpse, steal line Westworld. Counts virus density sewage Cape Canaveral indicated 85 cases time city reporting 3 confirmed cases. Much probably hotel guests fact remains confirmed positive cases drastically undercount actual infections. Huh. Imagine that. Large population centers highest infection rates. wudda thunk it? Uhh really don’t think “leftists” protesting, telling people stay home. I’m guessing asymptomatic may still get sick. anything shows fast thing spreads without social distancing. players likely meet workout together often. one gets it, lights group go social things outdoors limited people. friend bday party indoors tonight 15-20 people, masks. thanks. FrEeDomS! Ok dummy dum missionary responsible? Except 460K people can't expect everyone stay home indefinitely. going outside activities socializing important someones sanity. sizable contingent Americans indoctrinated cowboy mentality powerful corporate gun lobby, convinced guns somehow make people safer - despite evidence pointing contrary since invention.

But hey, that’s American education system you. seats first come first serve, assigned. Cuomo said cares NY thats it. Itd nest see President - charisma caring attitude command facts. oh well..... would risk dying plane crash get trip memories?

Life FILLED risk. greater chance dying car crash contracting dying COVID-19. wearing mask stupid. China itself. What's percent positive. says lot control too. outstanding 50 percent earlier. Nobody said people ""can't anything"". one avoid going public symptoms possible. theory gets cooler, get worse spread easily. Summer slows little. american superspreader tour around american cities inflate numbers go back top, brazil can't win race Everything bigger Texas! whole point lockdowns. Worked well. gotta keep Knowing everything Covid-19, would expect outliers cause mean different median less likely die Covid-19 majority closer median, likely die it? Oh know isn’t wrong - bad timing since “no big deal, young people getting they’ll fine” excuse reopening giving shit. people wondering Texas' positivity rate 10-21% range past week. usually varies day day. read article 2. information knowledge trump medical professional. idea people waste 5 years life 1000's loans takes 5 mins gander google. I’m hoping back monday Sorry, man, get paid enough teach. would SCB need go back correct it? 
The title ""The moralities Sweden getting closer normal levels"", say preliminary, guess 200 added. 
Sure could correct say 100 added 200, 50 excess deaths.

And think majority people interested statistical details visit SCB actually downloads spreadsheets interested subject. also state ""Facts"" considered raw data. attacks cripples nervous system. Consider lucky losing senses. got sweet lakes Nova needs becomes state Everyone's going get smarter. Meanwhile, live one orange states cases rising daily everyone pretending it’s gone. It’s shitshow. Yeah, almost every level US government handled horribly Way worse New York.... omfg. Ok dude. See 2 weeks. read similar story Texan given fed gov contract delivering food needy families:  earth celebrating I've read people take supplemental injections There's guy named Boris UK catched virus can't even put coherent sentence togheter, shit scary comment restored faith comment section. always amazing much echo chamber Reddit becomes. literally idea downvoted, absolutely right

maybe ""your"" ""you're"" Reddit petty days complimentary shot bleach.

Careful wording Yeah... majority new cases asymptomatic mild needing ICU... sooo.... see 2 weeks lol Low positivity rate day. Yesterday 21%. Maybe remove funding, then, since already jobs. He’s doctor who’s works frontlines, certainly “off rocker” hero. standard care might rising either way seeing less patients die good news regardless Also put glasses nose. Tourists displaced quarantine protocols. Agreed. Somebody's gotta number one, always us! 39000 tests yeah quite bit. 11%? AZ weekly positive PCR rate 3 weeks now. hospitals longer overwhelmed, course patients better. mean virus gotten weaker. dozens companies existence prepared supply basic things like test tubes. only. kind thing drives mad date set got worse might change. 2-3 weeks ago slowly declining looked pretty good Florida. Orange County Disney World made mandatory starting today wear masks pretty much business. 40k tests? Arizona 25% 10k tests. Honestly dude load shit. justify actions know actions affect others. Virus soon carry disease Mexico, Cuba rest Latin America spread infect poor Latinos. I’m American catholic upbringing basically everything daily sin must confess. that, think, comes from. three states worst outbreaks two months ago? Interesting. glad things looking there.   many records break week lol still job salary except Ohio hired lawyer deal legal battles Rest Peace.

We know mortality age range is, official numbers - one half one thousandth. always choices, good bad. damn sucks. kind infection it? america, gonna win one way another thanks homie, too. certainly puts shit perspective nothing else friends, live profoundly stupid country. kids 12? Yes, they're less likely get severe cases, still get pass along silently everyone else family back home, nobody wearing masks. thanks! Really venting. Thanks listening! damn really? happened lungs?

and taste came back, smell come first? time? gradually? interesting Hope best; plan worst.  Special effects common use virtual work. mostly, yes, im eating healthier. ive cut red meat almost entirely (no point cant taste it) drastically reduced artificial sugar intake. 

im far touch specific nutrient groups body needs, like carbs, fat, sugar, protein, ruffage, etc. said, still get cravings food groups even though cant taste per say, mouth like, feel sweet/fatty body makes feeling like YES WANT MORE. strange notice body physically reacts food much... like always starved. 

im finding eating far habitual psychological anything else. certain veggies still dont enjoy eating taste - need put sauce somethign ""enjoy"" it. 

generally eat less, im eating body needs versus want.

its never ending science experiment sometimes cool mostly sucks id love taste again. 

life weird. suck reading That's right there. Especially crowded gatherings indoors. Cuomo treated first exactly Trump treated though so... India. probably alarm disabled sound annoying. 7 day moving average 743.9 completed data. looking incomplete days - anything 14 day window course 7 day moving average - stay way. obnoxious form trolling Peggy Noonan attempted yet. hell tell haven’t suffered happen also intelligent. I’ve suffered must also intelligent. That’s doesn’t break easily crisp categories. It’s also tactic right wing machinery used dog whistle rural contempt urbanites justification ignoring science. 

Trump’s “people wear masks insult me” tweet ruthlessly narcissistic typical pugilistic reaction policy decided doesn’t serve politically. 

History already ample data pushed early lifting lockdowns relaxing non pharmaceutical measures despite science past. reason public health policy tradition putting rabble rousing side democratic societies pause — don’t, tantamount murder negligence, worse, proxy. Peggy Noonan happy proxy machinery years. What's point? mean like one state makes difficult obtain firearms state next door makes easy? hope China get dragged back irresponsible countries agree more. smartest people I've worked explained advanced statistics analytics work simple analogies. matter audience is. incredibly powerful. What's Brazil? I've never heard part America.../s stay personal life. We're gonna win, one way another dammit! Realistically it’s super rushed. Somehow Oxford granted approval phase 2/3 vaccine shorten time. may want vaccinate many people possible late term post market phase 4 trial whole population centers. hope works best, giving millions people vaccine life lasting long term side effects. Benton Franklin counties also feeling strain health care systems, Yakima County remains Washington state’s hot spot said 19% hospital beds Yakima COVID-19 patients percentage 2.5 elsewhere state

i think people also lulled sense complacency ability move patients around. lot rural areas capacity needed. least crowds still allowed despite middle COVID-19 crisis. probably playing odds cancer every single day. cant stop laughing this. right. LOL, PeggyNoonan.com. faux-populist pearl-clutching definitely unexpected tack take. wholly disingenuous, course. cure Coronavirus: Bed rest, Tylenol, chicken soup. Now, one million dollars consultation. Rural areas seem think immune. sorely mistaken￼ whole state Arizona high day Considering winter Brazil, bode well US fall/winter year tell honesty country/world would better Gore 2000? true year ago. less seen publicly, current President reported becoming assertive independent. 

The evidence Dariga Nazarbayeva kicked office President Senate, in-government opposition replace Nazarbayev loyalists. 

Fringe media reports Nazarbayevs completely bared decision making. Minority communities deemed essential cannot work home. would explain high COVID-19 numbers. live Community Valencia, slightly smaller Arizona terms population. Fortunately, I'm salaried dude, online marketing company, still earn whilst vacation. big deal vacation, came US 3 times last year, break hurt bad. Saved $10,000 lol. People seem forget ICU nurses long dealing needlesticks, tuberculosis, horrific hours, care-derived risks ages.

You already hero pandemic. Bravo. taken risk seriously, afraid socializing outdoors, even without masks. mean, try maintain 6 feet space non-household members, think outdoors, risk transmission really low. said beginning May Brazil first hit 100k cases we're looking ""relative"" control lock-down measures look towards Brazil countries regrets whether locked soon much.

Beginning May Covid time seems like decade ago. :( Texas right them. They've gotten 4,500 new cases last 24 hours. got lot people rally say fine dying. 

Are people they're going come contact adamantly refusing wear mask fine dying? could also mutate become less virulent. Gotta think like Florida Politician beat Florida Politician. virus might started later really spread also might test less US. That's hard truth.., unfortunately.
Living Europe, travelled India 2018. India screwed nothing except sacrificing 25 million lives guess really alarm. wonder number governor admit Rent cabin different lake - Lake Leelanau Glen Lake beautiful much less crowded. sandbar os going petri dish (even usual) Well username clearly checks out. people dont like told do. Oftentimes politics aren’t even involved. folks grasp ANYTHING excuse validate themselves. USA toxic culture literally killing us... Many protesters wore masks. Either protect virus. conceal identities. protests outdoors. packed stadium. Oh, it’s working.

Xoxo
- Covid-19 Losing rights best pandemic either, Americans care started, they're kind fucked. put Ontario shame. anti-vax movement growing rapidly along various unhinged far-right conspiracy theorist movements, even might save us time arrives.. ever. hope one counties good lawyer Four days take it, that’s absurd.

So time frame buddies it’s 11 days thinking sick finding out.

Which you’re FL experience common numbers least week old.

Exponential growth going go full Florida man. mean imply apples-to-apples comparison, understand people could mindset something need get used living with, no? Ro value according whom? Remember Ro 1 means one introduce new lockdown measures.

The calculation extremely pessimistic (and sense silly). spells worst case assumption currently is. Chinese economy silently crumbling Xi putting nationalistic war footing West. 

I hope leaders CCP realize winning continue path. Xi leading destruction Funny say that, trump going Marinette Marine next week, across small river upper Michigan... NY handle NYC, dense af. denser populations spread disease faster usual. take reasonable precautions. Wear mask indoors. Social distancing. eat local bar weekly. patio. suppose could become hermit delay inevitable lockdowns countries India's size. rather say controlled lobbyists strategy outlined Swedish government slow spread protect high risk elderly.

They slowed spread - top 20 cases per million population, higher Italy, Belgium, UK. EU nation (excluding microstates) higher number cases per population Spain. significantly higher Scandinavian neighbours.

They also protected elderly, failing openly admit.

By measure goals, failed. put marketplace section site, pickup. Honestly? looked around half human race would dead week back hunt gather food. survival fittest existed long time hence population 8 billion now. Neither yours, periodless freak. Exhibit: Flatearthers

They explain away much want introduce edge Occams razor Either way that's really high. spike cases live positivity rate 2% range. barely testing spreading like crazy? state full idiots governor head idiot all, trump supreme leader North Korea style shit. I’ve grown it’s sad see blatant disrespect ignorance. leaders traded money lives. People going beach destin say don’t need mask packed beach also includes gas station get ice, Publix get subs store realize get way sunburnt overcast day. Well grew beach it’s safe say wind easily carries enough spread. People general stupid. reading comprehension unfortunately superior

I add nothing conversation. Ill leave quote posteriority. guess. go checkpoint make suggestion quarantine. can't think anyone would going checkpoint. purely political. Denying truth playing partisan politics sub intended r/wholesome mother convinced virus hoax :/ Living SE Michigan kind scary see amount people going like crazy. Unless we’ve eradicated disease guess we’re fine. town live essentially created summer long block party attempts opening restaurants ‘main street’. People shoulder shoulder masks im worried we’re gonna spikes. want bash fash fash bash : ( That’s insane. Fuxk guy. Agree. fairly reliable publication they're known provocative headlines write ups. I'll wait science this. see disinfectant, knocks one minute, way something like injection inside, almost cleaning. see gets lungs, tremendous number lungs. it'd interesting check that. going use medical doctors, sounds interesting me, we'll see. whole concept light, way goes one minute, that's pretty powerful. Idk wouldn’t want go another state rn since we’re better almost anyone, lol. risk going state fewer restrictions? clue. seems like theft. I'm sorry, district. good friends teachers cannot risk bringing home risk family.  hope gets sorted August. Three months ago posted r/TrueOffMyChest COVID felt like meme see people (myself included) taking seriously long. fair, initial estimate 2 months better thought. right lot data covid affects fetuses.

But little know, appear though fetuses unaffected covid.

I would still take precautions you. “They” vast majority democratic voters early indicators too. week see first early indicators (part infected showing symptoms). Belgium, assume damage done last week february (week 10); got first clusters infections first week march (week 11) excess mortality started one week later (week 12). expected week get first people attended rally stay home work. 

Being hospitalized obviously stronger indicator, least took 10-14 days see numbers. Power. goes deeper that; yea sympathy people eating smoking death yes dig graves, remind gave shovel digging with? they've brainwashed (we've brainwashed) entire lives false needs. yes choice like choices give rats maze, takes fair bit self awareness even realize cage supposed wealth choices always predictable, limited, easily manipulated. 

I'm pragmatist heart feel feel humankind, also realize choices impact immediate circle's, focus try live life best can, kindness empathy everyone meet. would say major way sadness human race whole effected life I've chosen child free, want children, know type world children inherit, I'm going lucky live life without major upheaval happening. Maybe starting right now, maybe things get better people get collective shit together. knows. 

I'm saying empathy others pragmatic it. us genuine empaths. one greatest strengths greatest weakness different points life depending situation. bound happen population. matter wonder going hold one swing state loss many people could affect outcome election. Still havent seen study hcq administered hospitalization. know know, dont medical degree niether you. 

Its odd yet study drug admisintered patients need hospitalized. 

I speak experience. family friends north New Jersey including 80+ year olds diagnosed covid. given hcq hospitalization one admitted survived. Possibly working vaccine found. Best reason reopen gyms now!!! /s much lies corruption, people must figure believe. America lost credibility science. Look Asian countries much less mortality - doctors advice people supplement, wouldnt get sick; like rest world prayer - sanitizer, mask distancing Damn planning honey moon there. Guess cancel it. internal UV disco balls. Aggressive stupidity. sandbar?!?! many NY/NJ license plates town past week. people still vacationing? Due inept containment management virus. celebrating ... How? head's way. 43 million doses Good thing many old people Florida give to. live British Columbia, Canada. province done great job flattening curve, yet amount people hear saying conspiracy take away rights freedoms is, quite frankly, extremely troubling.

It's bias thinking Anti-Vaxxers seem adhere - is, effective treatment / measures, people tend disbelieve real actual threat. point enough severe infections event necessarily change minds denial coronavirus. data supports that. Orange county least started mandating masks public today. Tampa St Pete also made similar mandates, well keys. I'm sure places. shame Desantis decided state whole given stopping spread. Hes concerned opening theme parks, getting NBA going, getting schools open parents go back work. indirectly going kill lot people. *Only* 140,000,000 million people might die. hoax /s I’m fairly encouraged local community though. 

I live miles north Detroit, foot traffic mask use downtown area people outside walking around. people seem still using indoors grocery stores junk.

And cases I’ve seen people pull mask put walk downtown stores junk well. [It real Quaid someone explain counter argument testing happening? family members putting caution wind saying surges happening due testing showing cases, higher hospitalizations misleading say hospitalizations for. There's evidence suggest covid around earlier Nov 2019.  won’t wear think they’ll judged wearing it. think judge people wearing it. People got wish Astros forfeit 2020 season human race always survival fittest? higher case-fatality rate.

How know actual CFR know exact number people coronavirus country? answer cannot. guesstimate (like science try estimated guess). really care governor first honestly shes great even tho people hate shit like referring potential thousand new infection sources ""nothing. want see numbers come down. personally fixed on, control over. slow burn versus fire. People area throwing nice dry birch fire. cases, risk risk. excuse lack effective federal leadership. Looking EU versus US chart recently came breaks heart. peaked similarly, look us go, numbers continue steadily drop.

“Let clear: think masks important intervention,” said Bill Hanage, one signatories epidemiologist Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health. “But paper, is, position able look mask use compared interventions.”

So even critics admit masks important. Nothing yet Seminole county .. state left school districts. Yet direction Governor, passing buck.

There email well. Hybrid would seem logical, Florida we're talking about. ""literally"" public execution. That's unnecessarily sensationalist. bad situation though. rallies selfish absolutely kill people. True sad, also quite entertaining way totally honest. Like Walking Dead even worse script.

There system place get quarantined individuals food, medicine essentials. Saying get online reality tight budgets food stamps. 

Some jobs may fire could retaliate hard prove ways. example would service industry get sent home early called frequently, assigned labor intensive cleaning tasks waitresses, allowed serve many tables coworkers(yes thing every restaurant I’ve worked in. It’s “getting shitty section”)

Etc etc pockets America might set country whole. social safety net needs repairing, strong enough holes big. Everyone hopes Sweden gets rest Scandinavia ride sunset. 

I guess excited next asinine decision Swedish government? West coast. share beer bong. trying inflammatory Trump positive influence constitutional rights...

He enabled congress watches repeatedly break it, encourages followers ignore parts constitution don’t like.. simply making scientific point tear gas. bashing protests. Wow accurate Gotcha bitch. highly doubt people willingly social distance year, especially since told would “15 days slow spread”. Yeah good point much circle jerking subreddit. Yup, bragging rights state. Nothing concerned about. /s  Aren’t exaggerating little bit comment bud? Sounds like bit mad, share think topic instead attacking dude, you’re claiming superiority I’ve yet see showing line thinking idiotic. Tf wrong you....outing us like that. Maybe it’s America individualistic many absolutely like something greater good large group. Like people don’t like pay taxes won’t get that. ""today"" numbers trickle day. states report day one total, states report county day. (It mess.) current Rt around 1.35 per cases show 5-7 days. lets assume 1 week per round transmission.

They 4049 cases today. Taking Rt 1.35, means x amount days now:

7 days - 5263

14 days - 6842

21 days - 8895

28 days - 11564


So 21 28 days assuming change Rt number. Yeah it’s getting bad there. I’m trying convince mom aunt come stay ASAP. science says masks pretty much useless social distancing used.

But mask bandwagon strong cares science one feel better oneself shaming people wear masks Hey fair! Corona knows done it! supposed go away like magic! Spain here. Yes, are, sadly. anyone know many staffers total. would useful information. 17k likely get infected together one room. go home less likely infected rural communities. conspiracy make protect 100% successful. wave three colors front eyes trigger submission. Give red hat, send home payload. I'm East Lansing noticed same. Meijer go to, wider range socioeconomic groups, 90+% wearing. one higher average income level far fewer. Home Depot? Pffft. less 50%. truth. Right vs left plays role, biggest factor IMO know someone who’s gone it, you’ll take fucking seriously.

Right now, feel like “survived covid” got month long vacation couldn’t go bars. We’re survivors. beat it. lockdown. We’re invincible. 

They leave part 1/2000 people infected time. words, people masks scared snowflakes. stay home since they're scared. Where's PLUR vacation cancelled. Staying home summer. work basically staying inside house everyday girlfriend taking cat outside walks/playtime going walks store. actually really enjoying time home together staying in. wearing pants. ever close weekend first place?? also mentally safe go long periods time without human contact. normal want sex experience connection someone. People lonely struggling right now. Sex good stress relief. Shit, people stop fucking AIDS crisis. Yup bla bla bla
Don't believe everything read except this...
Fear mongering best
Nuff said may begin downvoting now..
This think is, time wake up
Have great day, got done tag football, good game never prosecuted this. think Biden going support knows side country ready go war. goal push Trump aside move forward like nothing happened. Ooooooooooooooaklahoma Virus comes sweepin' plain. looked Mississippi's data site since that's state I'm familiar it, everything wrong it. showing half MS's total ICU beds contract tracers employed state department health (while counties also employ many).

I know media sites really care Mississippi, they're far one state, I've got question whole project. Like lot things, College Sports one minor things lot people collapse results pretty catastrophic line. Strep respiratory illness. bizarre symptoms seen together really respiratory illness anymore. kill lot different ways. Lambo wouldn’t even going road packed I'm trying make sense sentence, ""they allegedly unplugged ventilator almost half-an-hour later, ventilator ran power.""

Sounds like ventilator battery backup case power failure. guess unplugged ventilator quick test kept running figured unplugged anything important plugged cooler. Half hour later battery runs out, patient dies, family blames hospital machine stopping minds *they* done anything power supply. read right?  bunch new cases, *before* event even starts?

Isn't really good reason health department shut down? BIG GRETCH! Adding context equivalent “spinning”. one jumped “just flu” neither commenters (I assume) believe. Keeping reading headlines though. Technically, California *can't* enforce federal drug laws. Around 1300 people killed annually police.

For equate similar number Covid deaths would need 260,000 infections. infections would also background level infection statistically unlikely.

Scientists also seen spike due protests. working idea level mask usage plus open air indoors makes difference.

It seems likely larger spike due resumption political rallies indoor areas open air protests. course masks can't prevent COVID supposed to. supposed reduce amount droplets exhaled air. wear masks help protect people yourself. Wait Chicago tourists swing up. hell, damn good question. everyone asking it. care answer follow question done right now? I've seen northern Detroit suburbs, caution seems quickly thrown wind. like hazmat suits gimp suits say funky S&amp;M pandemic sex Sure murdered cops go spread Covid 19 everywhere murder grandmas. Idiots. Incoming Swedish troll brigade 1....2...3...  actually praying elderly, sick children there. parents children taken events get visit child services. Reckless... confirmed schools going fully reopened August? got email kids’ school week saying ‘expect alternating schedules accommodate hybrid model’. Miami btw... Capsaicin targets pain receptors, I'd imagine still feel pain flavors. Honestly, good question. think covidgraph merges different mobility categories together, means everyone work, instead taking long, looooong walks parks nature, would show higher normal mobility.

But included trendline, likely people nature, know fewer fewer people working home, going shopping more, using public transit, etc. Mississippi hasn’t reported cases since frat party incident. haven’t case reported since Wednesday. LMAO astute observation that’s hilarious  wonder many people going conveniently ignore post read article, probably lot.

Green one better leaders throughout whole thing. Michigander here. food scene honestly shit. state pretty much shit. come state unless enjoy bad roads venison. know sure people can't catch they're still struggling first round. wish best. Tell take slow. explain many times exponential spread look like anything does. BREAKING NEWS :cough cough::

6 campaign staffers Coronavirus.

How could happened?? Yeah, went school few. realize Houston destination, though makes sense now. Glacier still pretty buttoned up. Blackfeet tribe got hit hard closed roads. brother died years ago age 36 3 kids wife.

Was wife since 17 15.

I see destroyed her. redecorated entire house remove trace work carpenter.

I look lot like almost looked like twins 2 years apart see look sometimes thinks notice kids avoid looking sometimes think look much like brother.

He affairs cocaine problem resulted heart attack. wife caught dating app 3 weeks died. died back taxi way home work Christmas party begged go knew like.

Even though put hell numerous times ashes still side bed doubt ever marry even though 36 could still life. died Christmas autopsy get buried 3 half weeks visited 3 4 times week stop starting go off. 

I guess like get together young bond strong matter even always good you.

You lucky husband better one brother.

Not sure wrote this. thought would let know lucky despite terrible time almost pull through. Man, wtf doing?

-An American. entitled. India dirt poor country poor educational standards. People angry best blaming others mistakes. mean things already back normal comes death Sweden now.

No, not.

In fact, recent report Statistics Sweden said excess mortality rising again, never actually dropped back normal levels. IMHO red states need 50 deaths day start worrying 100 deaths day start enacting restrictions again, ever. Best part is, could still buy seeds. Walmart. go local Ace support local businesses stop fucking bitching Word. study sharply criticized serious failings.

Your confirmation bias showing. search Molina's ""study"" reveals criticisms. ignored them. link Crude mortality rate really applicable ongoing epidemic.

The 9% talking calculated **current** numbers infected dead people Covid. stated *your* epidemic ended, calculated formula: deaths / cases [i.e. CFR]. **while epidemic still ongoing**, case current novel coronavirus outbreak, **this formula is, least, ""naïve""** ""**misleading** if, time analysis, outcome unknown non negligible proportion patients."" 

Therefore, spout like this. proper numbers current ramped testing Sweden - know crude real CFR. making mostly incoherent assumptions. Thanks Florida would totally live Sweden So, think you’re smart? mom believes hard argues wearing mask. seems refuses believe multiple basic facts science:

1. CO2 heavier air easily escapes

2. volume space mask face several times smaller volume lungs, even inside mask 100% CO2 would still take ton fresh air outside mask

3. actually breathing shit ton CO2, would pass minimum make sense

4. Even three statements false, immune system less effective would least thing worry seriously short oxygen.

5. immune system much way outside air lungs could hampered higher CO2. mucus such, designed passively collect foreign hazards, care oxygen content.

6. virus gets past passive defenses, pretty much screwed anyways nobody built immunity yet, extremely lucky immune system destroy/contain it. ,,l,,(-_-),,l,, true. like said, that's fucking studies work 

The poll 1,343 registered voters ,,l,,(-_-),,l,, fugly chant 'USA, USA, USA, USA' literally blaming youth.

DeShitstain blamed migrant workers well days ago. NY hub international travel. Florida not. Click article. IL green due lack contact tracing. green everything else. Don’t like let fool thinking IL isn’t well. 

Source: live IL track data daily. care less effective moderation here. Tough luck. Horse barn now, can’t reign back in. That’s lot disease vectors. Dude, life ends death mean virus absolutely terrifying. Dont downplay COVID circle life. 

For I'm 28 year old severe heart kidney problem. Also kid, yeah might little worried next person, come dude. Circle life bullshit take away us probably fairing well becoming sick, maybe want stick around kids. I'm ready circle life nip ass yet. 

The whole ""life must go going away"" dialogue absolutely stupid. admit sick sitting house falling victim thinking bad. Population? Density? Awareness? Mask usage? Better understanding virus?
Heat? Lag time symptoms? 

Take pick confirm. grew near Destin. Alabama. place best, went college hours away would go weekends summer. Ended singing Hank Jr stage River Dan 21st really much sign anything. powers say wear mask public, that's I'm doing. I'm one trusting authorities telling something outright generally speaking, like wearing particularly terrible. minor inconvenience worst, much thought needs put all. 

Now authorities telling something may questionable violation liberty, story would different. Asking people wear mask functionally different asking wear clothes all. virus binding receptor allow work like would normally hijacks cell make replicate virus. Coronavirus somehow created world pre-release non peer reviewed studies taken gospel. It’s wrong. doesn’t compare cloth mask use mask

One control arm mask occasionally wear medical.  better cloth. risks real face coverings worn improperly. Umm, realize Dawkins isnt American right? lives UK, sure would vote... countries schools reopened several weeks seems work well enough. 
BUT reopened mean everything like year ago. students take turns, half class time keep distance (depending school come every day every week) lot handwashing, masks mandatory that. 
In areas also daily weekly testing staff school's, one tests positive entire school put quarantine least 14 days. (They test staff adults, test elementary school kids without scaring shitless). SARS easy contain since high mortality rate. one 2-3% range, many infections asymptomatic/presymptomatic lengthy times driving spread.

&amp;#x200B;

WHO OK, certain countries not. countries exceptionally large death tolls virus:

1) USA - large population Obese chronically ill person massive aging population hit yet.

2) Brazil - large, dense population limited health care massive poverty

3) India - extremely large, extremely dense population limited running water, food shortages, multigenerational families single rooves(roofs?) already happened.

I know someone refuses wear seat belt. says 'Live free die'.

I words. easily answered question. searched. hospitals riot areas would filling new patients rioters social distance. overwhelmed. virus unpredictable areas? New York Louisiana, Atlanta, LA? people speculating second wave, first one already?

Exactly! record days every single day. time caution, people getting guards reddit thread days ago top post. study published hour later steroid approved think uks version cdc wearing, looks like small %
One many reasons virus continues spread. list freedom far outweighs safety You’ve watched Independence Day many times first wave second peak know sounds shitty mother I've made absolutely clear quarantining, social distancing, mask wearing = get even see grandson foreseeable future. boss went couple weekends ago, masks said everyone hugs within 10 mins meeting best friends. call 100% bullshit Same! cases around (that know of) I’m still wearing mask. Biogen conference back Feb fine scientists - 80+ infections one event People believe wearing mask good:

89% BLUE TEAM, 68% RED TEAM, 61% people strongly approve Trump


This unbelievable. really two Americas point. ""refrigerated"" part joke context? Can't decide decidedly Funny Funny solutions simple: stop reporting new cases new deaths. arrived 500 deaths/M shut every reporting. even US dared pull shit. maybe circle. know one person doesn’t like that’s part “The Cult Donald.” making up? trusting bad? Last checked COVID-19 going anywhere anytime soon. Things far over. seem upset? Yeah, affects young healthy.

You fucking dumbass. 65% opposing mandatory seatbelts law passed 80s. People always idiots. real evidence polls fare. Election polls much harder general polls make assumptions going vote, yet become less accurate overtime. 2018 midterm polls excellent. here. truly beginning despise fucking place overwhelming number fucking morons it. Maryland positive test rate going last 3-4 days.

bottomed 4.46....5.73 today. need society generate tax revenue. go prison they're 100% guaranteed get virus. way. That's nonsequiter. understand trying say. need specify. made come conclusion? Detail please. Can’t second wave let first wave keep going everyone’s infected. Honestly culture war shit left cause gets Velcro shoes shuffling polls. “In contrast, President Trump consistently ignored confidential public early warnings experts intelligence agencies prior 15th confirmed U.S. case Feb. 14.”

Fauci saying threat US “minuscule” February 18. Trump listening wrong expert. knew people fed restrictions let guard down, get hammered. Everybody, including media downplayed virus time pay it. Prayers weak countries struggling pandemic. Particulate spread WIDE DIAMETER, fucking moron. average age state health severe symptoms die Covid-19? information underreported. spin sounds criminal Adopt me- U.S Citizen SE PA I've mostly seen everyone wearing masks everywhere, though I'll occasionally see drive-thru workers mask pulled even talking customers. Friends family going outdoor gatherings too, riskier prefer try get close much now. guardian isn’t new best source girlfriend decided going PA TX visit family. going happy quarantine return.. might nail coffin tbh I’m sorry hear struggles narcolepsy. Question, present? Reports shown lot southern countries states hit harder actually nutter I’m friends FB posted screenshot Craigslist ad looking infected people pay attend. “This germ warfare!”

So...there’s that. Still early, wait another week two

Predominantly younger crowd

Heavy mask usage

Outdoor setting constant movement Everyone going get realize trump full shit vote Biden. /s live SC, hotspot, county highest number cases, assure “much hotter” 90. Americans chill make every single thread damn website somehow us Trump? Sheesh effectiveness masks question---it's usefulness used intermittently is. 

You're determined fearful can't think logically. say imply link source?

I know linked source, I'm saying stupid comparison North Korea distracts argument. future post source without things like ""We're NAZI GERMANY!""

And yes, read article, twitter thread linked article. hard piece together CDC quite unclear coding deaths. Still know make it. indeed many excess deaths unaccounted for.  pro-mask

You mean believing science? There's debate amongst scientists one. people ""anti-mask"" science deniers. don’t really know would happened absence lockdown. UK locked late game curve Italy others. long ""look irony"" news article get virus die. old enough remember people felt free smoke dining room. Restaurant owners never asked smoking diners leave spending money.

Of course, understand restaurants really want enforce rules policies. does? think restaurants believe policy necessary enforce it.

If county health inspector revokes licenses restaurants flagrant violation mask policy, enforce (regulatory pressure). enough people (like me) boycott restaurants think reckless mask policy, enforce (market pressure). negates efficacy mask use say, mass transit, exactly?

There lot holes “if don’t use masks eat give entirely” logic. 

And use term logic loosely. not, boats get torpedoed, saying following numbers states, FL new cases younger. Median age 36 believe. crowd goes more, especially places like bars get tightly packed. less likely die this, they're sure hell gonna spread around older population time. would guess that, plus advances understanding treating Covid seeing many deaths yet. There's single answer. Depends person, antibodies generate effectiveness antibodies. Agree completely vacationed Key West years.. 80s lot less commercialized, bohemian. cruise ships come town lost soul.

Key West, chickens, conchs six toed cats, always place heart. far Alabama trashy Florida panhandle, interested. Bummer beaches destroyed greed... green algae agricultural runoff developing Everglades makes less less interested visiting rest Florida. mind I'm tracking memorial day. 4-5 weeks that, deaths spike. I'd imagine beginning July we're going see beginning death spike catch up. Fun fact, FL state, whole country Governor says things Redditors agree makes cool It’s everyone fat, sick, shape, gets sun plethora pharmaceuticals. 2019 new 1999? Oof feel pain. I, too, shopped AliExpress. better several countries hard lockdowns.

Sweden ranked 5th per capita. lockdown, yes, also hit much earlier, i.e. less time prepare. Also, compare Sweden worst? still badly. Let’s fret too. resident NC honestly say population wear mask practice social distancing way fucking governor handling right pathetic. He's concerned keeping things open money flowing actual safety people here. Chaotic Evil Bot Nah snowflake republicans don’t follow logic ego Testing overrated - said powerful man -\_- understand saying ""hey wear masks people die"" freedoms, one forcing it, right thing do. disease spread virus expelled people's lungs mouths noses breath, spit, snot, stopped masks that... 'make hard people breathe' , 'get warm, humid, fog glasses', etc..


Just everyone is100% perfect masks 100% time, masks 100% perfect, dosent mean masks help stop spread virus. Florida. People go die. pay tax. get double taxation. bs essentially gentrifying language, notice mostly liberal ones it, especially Chicago lol hate that, I'm liberal enough like language (Spanish) get Infiltrated like make select minority feel included, someone's Latino/Latina want call latinx that's cool imma call lol, plus jus looks sounds stupid x end. That's think bullshit, others might reasons. I'm first generation tell grandma example I'm ""latinx"" gonna look like tf talkin bout look crazy, lol think yatchs dude.. mean psychological. describing exactly physiological definition. Anyways... know man, start mask wearing felt way describe (specially deviated septum) even going supermarket. used one taking dead tree forgot afterwards really mind unless beard gets twisted it. thing happened partner. hated passion surgery fix inflamation nasal passages, Dr. told mental body get used fairly quick, doctors do. like switch her.

I try convince otherwise, living beings inherently different might well condition makes wearing worse be. said people overreacting. beginning pretty much everyone know. Yesss Sure sounded like Yes depending situation. No, talking terms death rate. NY worst timing fact everyone lives damn close other. Comments like get upset. they’re not. grandparents live dad cousin regular ol’ latino neighborhood kissimmee florida grew up. MANY people grandparents living house hold a) can’t afford nursing home &amp; b) that’s Latin families live. family member could get virus anytime pass onto someone like grandmother that’s taking care them. I’m absolutely infuriated way handled Florida, people’s families could die they’re like “whatever, money human life”. live rural Michigan. follow guidelines stricter are. I'm seeing are. Maybe 30% compliance, loosely so. That's good point, see anyone complaining wear shirts shoes store either? reality. Universal studios reopened it’s roughly 10%-20% capacity. Big surprise people unemployed afraid. 😉 pro open find people post sub absurd. mean going back normal. means masks, reduced capacity everywhere, effort socialy distance.

The states seeing massive outbreaks this. Remember NY City mayor tweeted ignore Corona get go see play March?

Remember NY Governor ordered nursing homes take Corona patients killing 1000's

Remember Biden called Trump xenophobic cutting travel China shut Corona months?

Remember Pelosi texted people get visit China Towns near March? Yep, guess grandmother hospice 15 years... Reactions term mixed. Supporters say engenders greater acceptance among non-binary gender Latinos. Critics say term ungrammatical disrespectful toward Spanish language. supporters detractors point linguistic imperialism reason respectively supporting opposing use term.

Jesus Christ lets use emojis communicate going forward. People spend money worried catching SARS2 start seeing many people dying per day. We're starting get pretty fucked California, too. Lots places business usual now, mask usage dropped noticeably. Wow thought people existed Facebook New virus new world, along destruction rights, freedoms privacy. sacrifice worth making? \*Shocked Pikachu\* what's worrying me. Wisconsin trending downward around two weeks now, great, except everyone entire family Illinois swarms state summer. feel like look closing borders again. Many supporters happy unless they’re oppressing someone else’s freedoms. It’s enough own.

Not wearing mask takes away freedom anyway. lot articles morning don’t see tests much death rate reduced medication...is published? Prisoners contracted sickness. know I'm party problem. propaganda always there, simply paying attention it. Heard, can't one care man says anymore. Pandemic. Virus. political. Andy Cohen, Chris Cuomo, Brooke Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Borris Johnson. Lets add DONALD TRUMP list. ... think virus contained things actually worse, meaning containment measures needed? virus all?  Massively deaths similar countries, bad worse economic outcome, healthcare system backlog gigantic HCWs burning quitting, end sight outbreaks keep popping everywhere Sweden, etc, etc, etc. 

It's really form denialism say can't judge now. can. failure. Number clusters growing. Soon SK able flatten curve. know location. uses bluetooth detect another phone near, exchange random generated keys phone. Keys contain location personal information -- random numbers. they’re beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's absolutely uninformed opinion. experts agree initial lock India highly beneficial control numbers. People dying parking lots - Yes, healthcare infra overloaded administration best limited resources hand.

&amp;#x200B;

One also needs consider India robust healthcare ecosystem - due many reasons - absence crucial cog, numbers risen quickly. Many developed nations built network, piece piece many years. 

Yet, wish worst past/near India, recovery rates hit 100% soon (from currently 50+%). MICHIGAN GET CONCERTS FIRST. Dead people vote, unemployed do. Probably stupid ignorant people. Worst case nose 6 feet away people. Else, like wearing nothing. Melbourne jumped 10 cases restrictions back place. Glad live country take advice medical experts seriously. sub crazy minority. people world gradually returning normal Yes we'll win. Cause winners. find suitable vaccine treatments. Don’t pessimistic. Propaganda turned ignorant militantly ignorant. DeSantis tolled Phase 1 reopening, actually made sense based numbers time (restaurants 25%, etc).


The problem kept saying Phase 2 going based data science. never laid benchmarks were.


So two weeks later without real time evaluate whether Phase 1 working, went headstrong Phase 2 beyond.


And data science saying isn’t going well, DeSantis plans scale back. Shocking. big gretch slander sir. Fuck no. Trump Bolsonaro. r/nottheonion adding mandated testing contacts still letting play next week negative, even though likely negative due recent exposure was.

He likely exposed within two day window really need figure everyone around test private citizens bound PGA rules. yeah agree... top 3 worst countries far books order 1) Brazil 2) USA 3) Sweden 4) UK family AZ also acting like this. Part reason moved away. vibe Canada shifting. Restrictions easing; weather nice; people want enjoy themselves. I'm curious see plays next month. context number include cases two days ago due notification problems São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro Bahia  winning fight make getting immunity quickly deadly possible ask ICU capacity current ICU patients? know somewhere April numbers Holland ICUs skyrocketed almost enough available space. 
How America dealing this? boy! Honestly surprised anyone NC government level sanity It’s called astroturfing Russians run beaches everywhere east coast. know why, beach go florida New Jersey probably lot russians working shops things. mean outdoor protests majority people wear masks? You’re comparing indoor rally? president making people sign waiver attend? didn’t create virus, didn’t create virus, it’s here. Florida really good job keeping deaths low balancing normal life. commended. Good them. way strong economic recovery suppression/eradication disease. way majority people feel safe enough spend normal. Fear kills economies. think credit federal government. federal government also

* prevented states private entities testing;
* discouraged Americans wearing masks;
* gave false misleading happy talk looks like big offenders currently are:


Arizona
Florida
Texas
South Carolina 
North Carolina
Oklahoma Pretty much yes.

...Well, could worse: could Brazil. although US done *ok* relatively speaking (most states, even larger ones still lower absolute death tolls Sweden (only 7 currently higher)), seem potentially gearing ""hold beer"" moment. :( heard news girl talking interview: ""I prayed god think covid attack me"" preparing us election. we’re important state year saw yesterday Brazilian deaths projected higher American deaths August 1st. Horrific. Actually make difference. boomers America literally lived broadly prosperous time generation known world history basically major threat safety (they even grew nuclear world didn’t take nuclear war serious threat like parents).

They fundamentally incapable understanding world usually doesn’t work way saw it. US doesn’t allow outside visitors AKA yo momma. Exponential math :) big deal personally think restaurants dine-in till 2021. many idiots gonna go eat spread disease way. NY deadliest state Union.

Wouldn't follow lead anything Who? “overreaction” got us years worth flu deaths months.

What would happened under-reacted?

The *entire world* didn’t shut lulz. sad see two months positive progress gone drain. guys take two months uninterrupted nationwide lockdown break start seeing results. Yeah bad economy cares? first world country, can't force government pay 3 meals day roof heads would mean first world country anymore. next suggestion peacefully remove system government replace something filling pockets top bread roof everyone bottom. simple. Social welfare profits coexist. Nobody really gives shit though, many friends conditions go well together covid even said they've enough kills it. Good Lithuania don’t understand rationale. Let’s separate policy mandating social distancing actual act. way make sense said relation policy act. don’t think either policies work, fact believe policy mandating masks negative impact?

Because specifically stayed hell away person person would go, hypothetically, really chance specifically would catch virus. Especially weird state many retirees! Thats 50 sons ,daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers , sisters day dying though bro. detractors try minimize number lowest common denominator try dehumanize people fucking dying unnecessarily. surprised this? US special close borders want keep up.  Thanks professor Yeah man. feel ya. It’s hard know. best try make educated opinion matter. relies reliable data, soooo, it’s literally something us validate accuracy of. 

In opinion, It’s shit they’re potentially completely transparent. 

Personally don’t think excess deaths pneumonia causes, related much visiting hospital fear. it’s hard say 100% certainty much deaths caused covid19 directly, many based fear visiting hospital. 
Like said earlier, personally, unfortunately, believe vast majority isn’t fear going hospital. admit there’s fair amount conjecture Well question could applied well: someone whos looking previously limited information/knowledge regarding Sweden rest Scandinavia general ppl like bernie sanders keep screaming Sweden n Denmark haha..

My answer pretty disgusted Sweden, terms handling pandemic constant flip flops, down-playing statistics outright denial regarding serious situation also denial even herd immunity they've purusing months! except dont give facts, make numbers without sources. Yet US can’t get one officials quarantine since arrived. supposed work. Mission Accomplished. 🇺🇸 suggesting current situation disaster. Families safety net pandemic separate issue US hasn’t done good job confronting.

Sure, many people might avoided hospitals prevent Covid infection died consequence. impact isn’t clear yet. 

From data put Johns Hopkins, Covid reaching upper estimate Swine Flu deaths half time. I’d like think learned lesson previous pandemic.

Technically one dies HIV/AIDS ALS. It’s typically secondary disease end taking life. Covid. Pneumonia would primary cause death many Covid patients would inaccurate say Covid didn’t cause death. means die 🤷‍♂️ mean testing waters? care people die, knows arenas packed matter what.  Ok, governors approved premature reopenings blood hands like Fauci doctors lied masks.

Did somehow get impression I'm anti-lockdown? Lol Technically true, doesn’t mean doesn’t matter. shouldn’t complacent murder everyone’s going die anyway. numbers I’m seeing uprising cases deaths trending down. know deaths lag still aren’t seeing upward trend cases month ago. According seeing upward trend deaths now. It’s fine cautious also look cases rising deaths hospitalizations going staying stable, respectively. Lockdowns/masks/distancing serve flatten curve, end virus.

Nah, actual conviction, could locked like 20 days ended virus. Sure, would taken preparation make sure everyone enough rations, medical supplies, etc. *Actual* essential workers would isolate work (i.e. live work) keep virus spreading outside groups. 

If actually acted like functional, rationale creatures could done it. we're monkeys flinging poo point. really hurts i'm person wearing mask crowded areas i'm forced work Michigan. know things get really hand, masks go back on, then, one looking people like me. People going die refusal wear masks. could one them, CHILD could one them. think military enforcement order. Cops can't/won't anyway. virus bad enough require extreme measures people can't follow simple instructions. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Americans willfully ignorant find little ways selling idea wearing mask talking masculinity strength that... there’s pandemic put mask quit complaining nothing country world issue specific party arguing  explained: testing. Nothing idiots following safety precautions. Actually last days coronavirus decided behave follow directions POTUS pastor Kenneth Copeland blew away. small thing scared now. /s Hold beer -Oklahoma Why? subs different. one specifically scientific sources news... also mods remove non scientific replies data source trust? someone offer Donnie shares mask company. next day base 4 masks know mean, local ice cream shop live MI opened week allowed to. Line around building people standing close every nice evening since, mask sight. covering giblets seem mandate fairly well.

**Free giblets 2020!** aren’t fighting government assistance could actually help instead fighting open back drag even longer worse needs be? makes sense never mentioned disney workers strike post. discussing nurses. Also interesting assumed either female gay, relationship person potentially relationship job. false. lot leaps make one post. Repubs obviously saying Oi, California say? Aren’t theatres open something stupid low like 25%?

I’m definitely pro mask well, employees wearing them. contemplated putting plexiglass tight quarters concession stand would trap heat bad. Maybe get lot serious changes BLM, shift focus towards climate preservation🤷 George Washington owner slaves.

You’d rather racist slaveowners President foreigners? tell patients patriotic thing do. reason that. happens lot; plenty Sheriffs run un-opposed.

I bet half (or way people) know Sheriff's name, despite much power actually hold. Yeah, garbage writing. don’t understand. look developed world’s graphs cases per capita plus overall numbers, very, clear America fucking fucked. Nobody going want come America maybe DECADE more, regardless virus treatment vaccine developed. presidents past took pandemic preparedness seriously. Remember Chinese people attacked people visceral fear virus beginning? That’s rest world feel hear word “America”. Tourism trade fucked LONG TIME. Economy fucked long time! ^(Whispers: upward trend deaths.)

There upward trend cases. Due testing. avg age fallen 37 67. Without reading article, simply answer post title yes. chain strong weakest link. vaccine widespread, mandated. phrase 'social distancing' nonexistent, best obscure, rather recently; officials Center Disease Control Prevention used [*2007 advisory felt obliged explain term distancing refers methods reducing frequency closeness contact people order decrease risk transmission disease. Examples social distancing include cancellation public events concerts, sports events, movies, closure office buildings, schools, public places, restriction access public places shopping malls places people gather.*

Note definition include keeping people six feet apart, stifling surgical masks, barring inviting family members apartments. 

Evidently, even germophobes CDC prepared contemplate brutal disruption human life thirteen years ago.

In fact, memorandum stressed importance *“\[r\]espect individual autonomy”* *“each individual’s general right noninterference,”* adding even event government close office buildings restrict access shopping malls, *“\[a\] process place objections heard, restrictions appealed, new procedures considered prior implementation”* — something never even remotely attempted last three months.

In words, “social distancing” - used current narrative - really means whatever changing whims leaders would like mean, continue exercise “emergency” powers.

Meanwhile, use term gives false patina scientific legitimacy unprecedented government intrusions basic interactions human life.

The timing successive redefinitions phrase instructive. countries, masks required component “social distancing” [until time clear number new cases region [already leveling point sink moment: “social distancing” took extreme divisive definition moment that, rational calculation, restrictions reduced, removed altogether.

This implies that, bottom, “social distancing” intended serve genuine medical purpose.

George Orwell Japan soooo many people wear masks winter spread common cold. chronically ill American feel fully disenfranchised healthcare ideology. pray ability leave someday. Playing football probably dangerous them. family, coaches, teachers.c pastors, neighbors, anyone share air point infection chronic medical condition... *those* people need worry about. 

Unless live total isolation actually self-impose strict quarantine contagious, irresponsible assume risk intentional infection due possibility spreading further. Tell seize anything person’s pockets Civil Assets Forfeiture you’ll probably deal. (On side note, couldn’t remember term googled “police legalized theft” bam, was.) Denmark (where I'm from) people participated demonstration tested positive, 15,000 participants ordered take test. read contact tracers NY even allowed ask person participated demonstration. That's like, would shoot foot like that? lot deaths TX attributed pneumonia heart attacks, average year date past several years. Politely put us still recognize response put down. Fauci lies preserve PPE several weeks ago: BLOOD HANDS

Continuous reopenings months highest infection rate world: bad. Dont forget cannot open airplane window. air gets circulated eventhough filters nowdays still guarantees air breathe gone thru filter system someone sneezes coughs next you. maybe foood drink serve you. Oh man big ""surge""  work ventilators conscious one. Usually patient recovered enough begin start weaning vent using minimal settings. patient awake part extubation Herd immunity would require gain immunity infection - think jury may still one? Definitely ask discount. Go nextdoor find people coordinate with. Well cases lead death percentage cases. arguing death percentage going down? cautious? average age cases 37. literally due widespread testing. Calm down. reliable source tracking death rate time? 

It seems like positive tests sky high fatalities deceasing. Rescind it? hard. even need say that? audience small peepees? They're helping that's sure enough Americans already helping. can't blame one group people. Ah yes, Joe Rogan argument. I've lost much respect idiot meathead. country dictated fringe sides. Polls like show everyone nuts. media needs clicks, extreme gets that. Yeah fuck people. Root evil  Well NY 1,000 deaths day peak that’s whole country today peruvian buddy whose country fucked yours, take care, strong. Im sorry loss. Funny little story:

I work small business floral retail. owner wanted open store today, prepping opening step-by step. Today supposed grand reopening.

Yesterday, laid ground rules owner working: Customers wear masks entry, surface spray sanitizer work areas, hand sanitizer work areas delivery vehicles, common use objects get cleaned use (telephone, delivery vehicle), employees wear masks able socially distance, etc. 

The owner fit.

As one 3 employees actually came back work, said, ""Do fire coming back work conditions safe. I'll continue collect sweet, sweet unemployment things done."" Cue hemming hawing...bluster wind.

In end, grand reopening today owner prepared things demanded, also trying get things place leave along 2 employees, also prepared walk get protections demand, place.  Reopening prematurely bad, that's Florida Arizona problems now.

Also, Fauci government doctors lied masks done so. Seatbelts enforced fines people started using them. sense responsibility made use it.

It good ol stick! Imo mask sign privilege, given free can't signs compassion 50%, 50/50 chance tut positive

(/s) according WH. Yet. haven’t campus long enough get really sick.  find often wishing Arnold born United States could run president You’re saying people struggle lagging indicators weeks going see deaths rise. You’re equating upticks cases upticks deaths couple weeks later. statement supported numbers. I’m simply asking opinion. Maybe I’m missing something educate better. literally blaming youth. Even worse thought would they'll blame spoiled brats (that happen kids grandkids.) Average salaries SF high. Lol thought would article word “end” lot population California lives south. LA, San Siego, Orange county, Riverside, San Bernandino make 50% population. lol Yea problem climate change can’t wound back “easily” virus (which we’re failing pretty hard at, let’s real.) shit I'm told moron started explain power grab governments big business. 

Governments get mandate regulate, big business crush small businesses. 

I think airlines, hotel chains, retailers, casinos sports accidentally missed meeting big business got together decided this. Clutch straws. song among top 5 hated. even audacity rhyme exact word twice chorus. fucking lame that? thought aperture science fiction... still wants tests like these?!  ya click it? Cuz that’s care about. Also worth noting protests started around would help scientific leadership poor. many conflicting messages. First masks ineffective... effective. First everyone must home... BLM protests ok. long-term plan stay indoors wait vaccine, hell invisible lives lost economic ruin. CDC caught pants shown incompetent mustering unified response. inspire much confidence.    That's husband said. He's dead. hospitals go 80-90% capacity think numbers accurately tell what's happening places. point, hospitals start triage attempt save beds critical patients, clearing beds sending home admitting would normally get treatment—that's overwhelmed. care workers getting sick hospitals may also run available staff run beds.

That's start seeing ambulances denied families going hospital hospital attempting get loved ones admitted, hospitals reporting 100% capacity. see reality news then, numbers.

Here Sweden, patients 70 years age ICU dropped *normal levels* peak epidemic risen start March. They're serious trouble. Cases/100k nearly 700 vs 25 king county.  Jesus fucking Christ. Especially lock doors starts leave closed week two. news channel show faucis advice?

Edit capitalized help understand ignorance someone getting information one source. comforting focus things past longer matter. Focusing what's going right scary. Keep kicking horse, nice safe dead can't hurt anymore. stop virus sure... There's many levels hell underneath full blown dying. spend weeks hospital permanent lung damage etc.

Like 40% hospitalizations younger people, shits joke.

Also sure got 80,its like 60. 80 average human lifespan begin with. disease hitting 65+ crowd hard fuck, younger people dying much worst month life plus permanent damage.

Then spread elderly, subsequently die chance, many comorbidities have? I've never seen figures per original response would unlikely bagged salad would get table less 72 hours longest period seen steel plastic. That's differentiated bagged salad takeout food heated like sushi salad could theoretically contaminated since relatively short period time handled possibly contaminated would eaten.

However, read anything indicates transferred orally digestive system many cautious people handle packaging care. body injuries



Lol see another hockey fan here.  HEY AMERICA, COUNTRIES WEARING MASKS POLITICAL STATAEMENT.

I FEEL LIKE NEED YELL THIS. given.
I'm putting something important ahead mild discomfort vanity.
It reflect part personality meaningful way. assume people same. No, examples valid. Please explain example said consistent said later. said I’m wrong intimated don’t read past headline can’t understand complexities. back up, like requested do.  Yeah. outside oldest, sickest, groups earth, statistically less serious flu. Step 4: Repeat maybe virus mutated weaker (plzplzplz) right, banned discussing it, probably be. 

Government decisions direct impact spread virus, ESPECIALLY government officials flagrantly disregard health care expert opinions. get paid shit. work University(not professor) see kids work Disney make shit. don’t mind, literally experience. Rich parents? parents rich get kids move back? really think guy dresses Mickey Mouse paying mortgage paycheck? wish Arnold called mask refusers “Girly Men” mask-related rant. 

That might drastically changed people’s positions hurry. Yes, 1 million infected 2.3 million tests.

 ***50% infection rate***. 

Probably Brazil already infected country world. That's contradiction? Honestly getting oral contraception accessible telemedicine. That's reason go doctor otherwise healthy young person. *need* see much think. also shut go away

I stop gaslighting people mask lie. Employees wearing masks around neck / nose, sure lol ain't getting many deaths outside 65+ age group. Statistical anomaly. whole sub sewer. May well add Mississippi list. 500 cases haven’t reported three days  really bother many us much all.  ""There's reason walking around mask""

\-Dr. Fauci Dude, what's interesting read he's actually said (I did) contrast all. That's problem headlines people read headlines, especially relates complex issue. shame impression constantly contradicting himself, neither examples valid all. couldn’t 3 months going accomplish it, though? course agree have. also realize country shitshow could wait around forever. Honestly, healthy 20 something...I’ll take chances COVID go three months sleepless, sweat-drenched hell.

Giving AC big no-no me. That’s foot goes down. didn’t mention he’s ground keeper thus lives shack next mower. Back Feb knew masks effective everyone wear intentionally lied public it.  admitted within last days. Yiiikes. 6000 cases county 250k. 1 every 41 people, 2.4% total population. know diseased dongs especially one night. still think get looked bro, still good time. protests literally killing people.  deny got rally. They'll blame protests. clear, protests going spreading virus, too. fact going make much harder convince anyone rally attendees may gotten rally instead. It’s proven. environmental science community total agreement climate change occurring. denial point simply distrust science. It’s possible prove anything person distrusts science believe empirical evidence presented them. said testing rate. Lazy typing... Enlightening results? Entertaining results? Darwin awards? This. see many people think immune catching anything wearing cotton mask hear would handing masks, no? wonder many actually show up.  comparatively well however inept PM sped process unlocking draw focus public scandal know, wearing mask sissies sounds like can't wrap brains around masks largely people's protection, reciprocate. Okay there’s sucks disease dying it, yeah hypothetical young healthy person might fine, doesn’t mean won’t act vector spread people risk. less panhandle, still. know tactics people like you. Spread lies people ask proof pretend like exists demand others find proof exist. yeah someone understand population sizes thinks we're *early, early stages*
at least look graphs day. Like Switzerland Italy. Actually far off. 23 per minute today. Agree. states taking way fast. world Disney World need reopen right now? 

You’re getting downvoted majority sentiment sub want sort reopening return partial normalcy don’t care grandma. reality younger people don’t get sick this, makes sense take targeted approach overall, still banning medium large gatherings. 12% nursing home residents NJ died covid, that’s unacceptable. going dinner isn’t changing affecting grandmas risk level. Guess you’re fine people driving drunk then. I’m sorry, ridiculous take ever heard. 

Yes, wear masks stop blood entering like Fauci tho think he’s diplomatic sometimes though message gets lost. 

I multiple friends swear podcast Week Virology. Good news, warm weather kills virus. Tremendous..tremendous news. Best news I’ve ever given. also fake news. It’s great question. Let’s suppose virus killed 85+. that’s exactly would do. doesn’t: it’s risky starting with, let’s say, age 50+ age bracket. think kills around 1% 50s (approximately?). Regardless it’s enough people wouldn’t feel safe. Sure would survive don’t know ones ahead time you’re quarantining massive percentages population. industries even work people 50+ home months. Universities won’t work. Sports coaches management stuck. It’s going hard get much anything going you’re basically back soft lockdown. Beyond that, families quarantined? quarantine protect vulnerable family. far interconnected complex say “protect vulnerable” Would churches count? Quite bit clusters services held. ^^^it's_just_me...cute_lil_pygmy_hippo also breathing problems multiple respiratory infections past. 

I dont want disease attacks lungs issues Say nah bot. seriously pisses end. want wear mask, obligated patronize restaurant requires it. Restaurants private business every right require face masks. failure make sell branded MAGA masks back March show astute business. could made tidy profit incidentally done society good. Lol. test anyone, zero deaths estimate deaths years like influenza pneumonia.  definitely described better did. saying, people say they're worried air recirculated. I'm worried air flow AC vent pushing drops someone talking breathing. ""It's abusive point problem I'm whining solved weeks ago. know I'm right I'm also abused also shut go away. hard correct victim. Woe me.""  actually. worldwide merchant fleet north 50,000 vessels, 10,000 bulk carriers. Total number vessels could even vaguely define cruise ships perhaps 250. Fine me! want coming state mocking ridiculous analogy brought Governor California, ""snarky"" state country. Californians think matter.  Death Disney? Disney talking about? Moving back home parents? Must nice rich parents move with. Also think people work Disney fun money? tell parks CEO. I’m sure would love turn everyone volunteers.  It’s like dying sick binary though. I’ve gnarly flus, I’m trying sick af simple precautions taken Yikes what's going Dallas right now? fuck everyone health issues 80? ? nah RemindMe! 3 weeks OMG least another 30 good years. Fuck covid, taking young people prime, better lock again.  What’s deal NY? 1167 new cases? shitty news today one upset most. Thats bad. 36 domestic, 31 imported Abuse is, again, category behavior, category disease. it, guy Gray matter head lol, pointing OP said average 5 months, paper clearly states average 14 months.

That's first mistake.

The second using median calculate loss months life, must use mean, median.

just curious, account OP?  seriously two different people make exact mistake? admit, I'm fucking tired arguing people stupid you. I've saying months virus originated Earth simultaneously originated last year guess fucking what? Almost every country finding evidence virus country December latest. reason noticed China anywhere else population dense people literally top other. allowed coronavirus spread like wildfire. Patients actually developed simultaneously late November December last year. apologize later news articles come verifying this.

Other that, shut fuck up. even happened before. mass media, world even worse, mass media brought homes. internet allowed us see FREQUENCY shit happens. don’t wear masks inside, least local one GA. Redneck doesn’t wear mask. 

Water wet. 😭 unfortunately, pandemic exposed stupid average American really is. extremely rare win lottery people still buy tickets...

And one thing risk yourself. another matter entirely *risk someone else.* don’t agree comment chain going wanted know found comment insightful. current reddit groupthink government underreporting covid-19 deaths. made statement opposes groupthink, therefore must downvoted. Yeah, police also selectively investigate murder charges, too. much hate Kid here? very, talented musician think gets overlooked. Woodstock 99 absolutely killed hour long set, picked every instrument stage proceeded shred. Caution NSFW. Link contains Boobies. many deaths? Death makes even difficult wear mask.
Asthmatic here, wearing mask inhaler close by. Rather asthma attack calm inhaler catching covid surviving $800k hospital point?  Quite literally trolley problem god use cloth face coverings: children age 2, anyone trouble breathing, unconscious, incapacitated otherwise unable remove mask without percentage jobs think actually essential? us may well writing stories real value jobs bring society. we've seen poorly treated essential workers are--there's point ennoble empty words. can't even feel good something useful disrespected compensated poorly.

But jobs drive inspiration, anyone qualities food worker probably unhappy neither rewarded. drive inspiration, lesson I've learned take hands wish luck.

Edit: Basically, drive inspiration equal taking shit job necessity. Yesterday deliver something MAGA relative. wear mask ""doesn't buy narrative"". Meanwhile he's shared Plandemic, changed profile pic Stars Bars, posted publicly ""second Civil war here"" amongst MAGA talking points anti-mask anti-shutdown.

It's incredibly frustrating. 100% agree. small thing make huge difference. Lots people would Otherwise Die live small subset Americans head firmly ass would find way remove think good news. something troubles recent findings covid sewage Italy December. Like takes time rev really spread. Maybe idea super spreader persons. Needs mouth breather something. Still gonna wear mask outside always inside spots near others Luckily state police. sheriff's caved pretty quick Gov said would use enforce order sheriff's wouldn't. city police. excited cuffing uppity county city police, since they're top pack. Hopefully, Lots people NJ work Philly NYC places strict policies people working home. Thats say called bull shittery. Based wastewater data, Biobot gave estimate anywhere 2,300 115,000 infected persons within area sampled, though 446 cases area  sub control reality. Ignore virus worry even worse off. Thanks noticing. blessed Ok. you. I'm disagreeing that. seems closed shut mind entire group people. little hypocritical will. Maybe 10 percent, actually make 2 percent they’ll leave teenagers teenager fever lie say don’t one. Still everyone develops fever still virus. One would think governors superintendents really take close look jails, prisons nursing homes decide they’re willing risk children’s lives along staff school. could send kids back broke way. Maybe two three kids per teacher elementary kids would go school using schools district able break kids maybe days middle school high school aren’t school they’re online learning. schools would also away allowing certain amount absences child wakes sniffles cough can’t attend school even it’s allergies. another problem arises. many children miss bunch days parents lazy get morning child abused. It’s really loose loose situation especially children use school escape place actually get love food. people think point neglected child reality children hide really well they’re scared takes keen eye person experienced abuse child catch it. know there’s children abused shutdown people know get away don’t outside influences worry about. last time rode subway work was...? rush parties happening JUNE??? universities even session??? clear one topic one side political aisle. Russia learned swirl much chaos possible creating crossfire enrolling Americans fight other. can’t pay fine? Something like 40mm lost jobs. refuse community service? Also, putting people refuse wear masks nursing homes probably won’t play well. say disappointed us, whole, understatement. one stimulus check step right direction unfortunately *really* help. unemployment payment boost great thing large, absolutely, positively, bungled handling *new disease* beginning want out. I'm first gen American ties born here. attachments qualms leaving.  like pretend matters states well, like island like NZ really patrol boarders. People free moving US. conservative bad hygiene?

And risk lives leaving house either thing ""legitimate medical condition masks concern"". maybe sociopathy. used run medical weed shop years. people demand everything could think of. Indigenous peoples tribal membership cards lieu medical card, ADA violations every kind think (no can't bring 15 year old friend back ""They autism), HIPAA violations (""You can't scan med card!""), foreign tourists trying slide in, kinds pets snuck in, pretty much ridiculous claim privilege could make! educational. Link it. Cause see it. Title change mean know cruise ships awful places get stuck pandemic we’re talking one-time event people crammed assigned seats. Going lot easier learn extent spreads. sure did! disagreed numbers putting justification end lockdown. Depends source use set cutoffs day. cutoff around 5pm est. Worldometers 9pm est. change data, puts numbers different discrete buckets. even don’t, can’t imagine wanting risk getting sick 2-4 weeks. got sick pneumonia mono two summers row high school. Never went hospital, sure hell don’t want go again. regretfully lived 9 long years, happy got Dixie soon chance moved back north! severe cases deaths ""2nd wave"". Less one death per day since May 28th, consider start 2nd wave. cases students young adults.
As long change, reason strangle livelihood ~800,000 people lost jobs since March (edit: plus ~200,000 small businesses service providers). Extra point needed sudden death Right wonder feels cognitive dissonance outraged situation completely fine according economic ideology - private company able set terms services deny services refuse follow them? hospitals run space people start dying om streets. We've sheriffs say enforce parts Cooper's Covid response figure that's why. person particular issue wouldn’t, more-verbal people autism neurodivergent conditions could easily articulate problem yet still bear wear mask length time. 

Again, that’s asshole, there’re lots different ways autism manifest itself. also macho bullshit too, stupid. wearing mask convey people ""i want die"". whole point there's shortage people know need though. Well fair number gets tuition, stipends, booster goodies Chile like wealthiest country south america. probably going stay way... smokes weed asthma? thats crazy. never said Dems right. problems, brand GOP beyond deplorable. small measure benefits public health. Anyone would bring lawsuit needs question reality, rest us seems like early concerns assumed virus would flu like, living transmitting surfaces, deadly way SARS is, actually sick/contagious people would likely show symptoms. Mask wearing (in non-medical contexts) normally focused protecting wearer, we're still saying sub-n95 masks good at. understood surface transmission unlikely, told us airborne transmission worked asymptomatic/presymptomatic contagious, changed understanding disperses. Combining original understanding transmission possibility(reality) shortage meant telling people wear masks made sense. Sciences valuable asset ability admit wrong change. Taking ability away ultimate politicization science. I’ve lost additional ten since things started. found eating feelings zero caloric intake. (The weight loss true) fine hundred assign community service nursing home ward packed sick covid people. many people US suck decent neighbors fellow citizens. saw AZ 85% capacity hospital beds ICU beds NOW. That’s huge rise cases past days. good. disease \*appeared\* control US week there, too. political stunt succeeded. Sigh. Lol usc stands chance born 25 weeks! doomed! lived puny 16 years! Wait... think would policy decisions let virus quickly explode pandemic first place. Waiting way long ban travel China, testing, saying masks don’t work, allowing mass gatherings like sporting events continue far long, calling virus flu, etc. 

Lockdowns highly beneficial quickly controlling virus, aren’t tool imposed country without consideration would hurt people meantime. complicated issue hope future historians don’t simply mark good thing failure.

In China made sense government could use truly eliminate disease since control people well Italy made sense Lombardy’s hospital system collapsing. countries excellent job controlling virus successfully using testing tracing control new outbreaks. 

But India lockdown caused immense suffering among millions migrant workers looks unlikely done much stop virus long-term cases continued climb. Zimbabwe it’s informal workers suffering greatly (why government destroy stalls?) may even starve death, tragic. 

So really depends I’m trying say. may decide hindsight lockdowns made sense wealthier countries easily provide food assistance easily implement sophisticated contact tracing programs used stop future flare-ups. it’s important realize virus lead many deaths still cause significant economic damage without lockdown (see Sweden). Yes! even consider possibility immunity permanent? maybe immunity (still hotly researched due varying design flaws involving antibody response)? means herd immunity would either disappear quickly, completely non-existent another potential coronavirus re-infection. bwt doesnt sort illness simply contrarian. selfish disconsiderate jerk putting others risk. funny thing medical condition requires wear mask. getting covid could kill me. bet im wearing mask, matter anyone else thinks says. That’s Badass, man Muricans ignoring science? Never! say.

Over 8 million people are/were infected, 1% human beings earth, it’s 6 months.

It hasn’t hyped enough. seems one myopic preoccupation numbers you. Deaths gone enormously afflicted states, hospitalizations have. number people Texas hospitalized covid doubled. And, case clear personal experience, hospitalized people typically well. covid debilitating effects, even victim spared.

In hardest hit states we're seeing spike 10's thousands cases, increasing positivity ratio tests, thousands hospitalized.

Thank you. pretty simple. Daddy needs economy good get re-elected. economy hurt Coronavirus raging control. Masks show public fear Coronavirus raging control. Ergo, masks = fear uncontrolled Coronavirus = good economy = Daddy wins. looks it, guy moron buys Chile vs Argentina bullshit. surprised actually Piñera supporter whatelse.
Truth is, Chile shit managing pandemic since beginning. Santiago completed month quarentine, buy social aids keep people going outside work cash unemployment checks...having 40% mobility still...so numbers going Santiago actually going cities like Valparaiso, Concepción others. Good news despite anti-protest people want try get people believe, protests seem majorly contributing spread virus. Looks like mask wearing + outdoors cuts significantly. Probably similar crowded beaches seem huge effect. Hence states spiking ones reopening businesses, whereas areas heavy protests seeing spikes. sorry wearing face diaper June heat humidity like wearing full winter gear beach Florida. mental thing, that's physically feels like. weird people Reddit act like can't understand wearing sweaty thing face gets hard breath comfortable opinion piece even Instead attempting independently verify Chinese claims, took face value

So gave information known them.

What said Ya that’s withheld information 6 days CCP told them.

FYI, there's pattern pick people spend much time conspiracy subs. guys seem settled using CCP instead China. huge red flag. think state power command everyone wear masks, without going proper legislation channels first. That, masks help prevent spread disease. Hardly anyone wearing mask. mask actually work, 95% population needs wear one probably around 8% right Hospital would better &amp; pandemic over. Bet decide mask good idea then. elaborate this, provide link? Says patients Nothing's reassuring hiding numbers numbers doubled span one comment, impressive.

Yep. Different methods. raised issue numbers, used different method meet requirements.

But guess did? made growth number cases even faster original graph. means slope April 18 even steeper originally showed.

I'm sure thinking 300 000 600 000 two months. 

Yep. calculated 18 day lag, assuming estimates using antibody tests accurately reflect total number cases, given known recent studies found milder cases may develop antibodies first 300 000 took what? month? 

Nope. first case recorded February 4. took 70 days total exceed 300,000 April 14. That's 2 months, 1 week 3 days.

June 18 65 days April 14. That's 2 months, 4 days. number cases greater 600,000, rate infection either slightly higher first two months.

As said... flattening? protests abuses police important (and long overdue), blame anyone protest government's failure uphold responsibility people pandemic I'd hope given current circumstances they'd resort mass protests last resort. 

I think effective thing people far vote refuse step replace people vow better. We've seen protesting lead change, slow inconsistent. worry people removed positions government change constant uphill battle. ['Cause he's bigly manliest man. People saying it. Real men saying it.

I kind (not really) understand protests obligatory masks, another level intelligent amoung us interpret threats. We're minority. Authoritarian regimes right people charge passed flying colours (Vietnam, China) yet you’re fine. you’re 18-45 age group .01% mortality rate. Even adding older people nursing homes it’s 99.6% recovery. It’s basically bad flu season chrissake. like worded Speaking numbers &amp; statistics, here's one found amusing:

Today's new Covid-19 cases Florida 3822. Per capita, that's 0.0001780.

Vietnam's cases *entire pandemic* far 349. That's 0.0000036 per capita.

So, Florida's Awesome Pandemic response 49.6 times worse *for today* Vietnam's whole 6 months-ish pandemic far. 

Now let's total cases: Florida 89,748, Vietnam 349...that's 1165 times worse. many cases Florida has, Vietnam's epidemic would started King James Scotland stabbed Walter Stewart &amp; son James II took throne. know, 1437.

You remember Vietnam, right? people whose villages used napalm kicks &amp; giggles? Say, US army used train Vietnam Florida weather similar, terrain everglades similar? get virus eventually? Allow share theory you. Spanish Flu bit hobby mine. first wave Spanish Flu lethal elderly. second wave lethal 20-40 year olds. 

 second wave far lethal first. theorized due WWI sickest soldiers sent field hospitals spread deadlier strain. problem is, explain many people age 20-40 died compared elderly population.

Right now, Covid far deadly older people. There's debate there. younger people taking serious we're seeing surge younger people getting affected. part, well.

My theory this. flu starts come around, Covid-19 going much susceptible we're going end ""Syndemic"". healthy 41 year old friend long ago got ended ventilator. suspect would fine one other. believe Spanish Flu syndemic another Coronavirus.  

Point being, need see happens flu season. country? sister got February still can't physical activity recovering lungs still wheeze Lol Working people know toward goal can't immediately see= socialismcommunism liberal DEMONCRAT PROPAGANDA ANTIFA REAL RACISTS DONALD TRUMP ISNT WEARING ONE WOULD I?!?!?!?

Judging past comments, I'm going end conversation basis futility.

Reality got triggered started grasping straws. Lol ""Never interrupt opponent middle making mistake."" Exactly. say it’s tragic situation things getting better. apparently isn’t possible people tourists give sh1t.

It feels weird reading tourists - *tourists*? anyone travelling pandemic? allowed? mad. year, 647,000 Americans die heart disease. 

You rocks brains what? lost DOUBLE less 4 months. way communicating waste spaces like take lacking brain cells accepting fact. Belgium also 100x density US counts deaths worst-case scenario. can't put 2 next like that. deaths lag cases couple weeks minimum. Especially Italians started publish pretty early. Actually, Chinese same, just, publications ignored people.

Somebody made later article data says publications Italy. main difference location specific things general say, health problem very, careful.

It hard understand countries went complete shutdown instead isolating vulnerable one keep economy intact possible. maybe planned stealing election anyways matter (mis)handle ongoing CRISIS. yes, corrected title response comment point can't ignore though, like someone know affected. Oh god, posted John Ioannidis, I'm brilliant scientist, reason massive blind spot regards Covid-19 IFR I'm going cherry pick modify reason bunch studies ""prove"" Covdi-19 dangerous.

I give momentum important, I'm also pretty sure would get another spark ignite wave protests next year. I'll leave social psychologists figure events spark massive protests seemingly comparable events peter month attention. Fauci says lied needing masks March save first responders thus undoubtedly killing thousands people could otherwise worn bandanna face covering.

Fauci said shut lives 2 weeks flatten curve overwhelm hospitals it’s 3 months. anyone still listening Fauci?

Like didn’t know different appearance northeast Indians long source significant racial tension. doesn't. says fatality rates. death age. percentage people illness die. could average age people die 0.04%? understand post. 16 661 287 tests conducted. 

32.7% new confirmed cases asymptomatic moment test. one biggest concerns death rate showed quite bad feared. 

I narcolepsy, probably autoimmune response flu strep, barely livable now. I'm terrified virus like could cause symptoms progress. 

Post-infection complications linked number chronic conditions like ME/CFS, Rheumatic Fever, PANDAS, etc. 

I really hope see surge people society deal chronic disabling conditions result infections lack certainty good reason cautious fatality rate. this.. Oregon, population 4 million ONE death age 40. person terminally ill cancer patient. get fuck fear mongering. fact collectively elected many dipshits office sign willfull intellectual negligence U.S. need fund education teach next generation think critically compassionate towards fellow human. 😂😂😂 sheep ass It’s definitely happening everywhere. Sacrificing elderly infirm. Don’t hold breath anyone punished though. went doctor handful times unrelated things since always take bpm, always bring high dismiss saying it’s probably anxiety... probably “look” healthy. doctors shitty lol. people bunch drama llamas, media able profit temper tantrums. Maybe I’m wrong seem like you’re saying science regarded true basis fact small percentage papers fraudulent.

Well science recipe, methodology can't really regarded true. like saying recipe ""truth"". makes sense. say recipe good recipe makes tasty, nourishing meal doesn't. papers usually quickly retracted, often destroy people’s scientific/medical careers, strong incentives fraud. scientific method self-correcting, errors eventually caught. 

That's fallacy though, since undiscovered fraudulent papers undiscovered know many papers usually quickly retracted, often destroy people’s scientific/medical careers, strong incentives fraud. 

If they're discovered, peer-review self-policing seems work given whole Surgisphere fiasco along many others. scientific method self-correcting, errors eventually caught. 

Again fallacy. People state fact, know undiscovered fraudulent papers there, idea percentage papers corrected think call Orwellian might taking words little context. sounds like meaning “truth” scientific realism. best scientific theories least partially true, it’s hard argue otherwise. watch bacteria evolve develop antibiotic resistance, see things fall according laws gravity, chemistry works quantum mechanics, etc. Even theories eventually refined, modern science whole definitely least partially true. hard explain modern scientific theories could make amazingly accurate predictions world untrue.

It's hard fool yourself, especially direct benefit fooled. whether something true dependent tests, well designed poorly designed fraudulently designed. test something can't explain it, like gravity, quantum mechanics, etc.    hard explain modern scientific theories could make amazingly accurate predictions world untrue.

Any good examples? less 60 years ago scientists know white snow TV from.

Science really motion created move making one mistake another. Hopefully new mistake closer truth previous mistake. Even true, meaningless waste time government doing. 

Up next resolution congratulating Representive Scott's dog ""the best boy Knoxville"". Asian countries demonstrated coronavirus kept control without locking whole society. film studios release films knew silly film like would biggest pivotal shift film industry half century. Don’t mind living ends dying, virus isn’t going away. It’s stay. It’s if. It’s when. neighbor behind grill outs... roast coffee patio coughs like mother fucker half time I'm there... Wtf.

I (work emergency dept) seen people essentially blow mild shortness breath, go business, meaning going businesses... strikes *something* ain't right (not COVID! Hell no!) come ED...

Have close relatives best understanding, think coronavirus, mild intermittent cough weeks, still go out, still go stores feel need, still go see family. lev believe coronavirus 1,000% serious far tell. 

The psychology around straightforward all. Honest God think ABNORMAL statistical sense clear headed picture personal situation is. Motivation belief denial powerful. 🤷🏿‍♀️ alright Random found wisdom perusing /r/Oldgeezer account today. He's centenarian lost everyone wise words goes on. look study curious, read one last week sought validate sensitivity several antibody tests found 90%.

Which would translate greater 10% test positive antibodies even them, makes study insignificant well. adjust specificity sensitivity tests, can't get accurate data. Ok mr/mrs sheep. intelligent lololol takes special kind ree ree follow herd Doesn’t assume states don’t assign electoral votes winner take all? Repeating also something babies do. find comforting. still understand much awful person ignore virus.

Same shit happening country, approximately 1.5 million people 200+ infections daily.

Restaurants, coffee shops, malls, gyms opened month. United FAs little greedy I've hearing, blame them. cash buyout years ago $100k couple FAs know took it. United say would last one, kind silly industry tanks, senior FAs expecting cash buyout. comedy show? know don’t see NBA come back month Jesus Christ, absolute danger society mentality. Honey, comments go away. 1st measurements. Georgia's data 14 day lag - today's data complete. seven-day average 736 upward trajectory lately. Again, 🤷🏿‍♀️ ok Running car every 3-4 days die

What's car? can't necessary. Yes illiterate babies. lot attendees may visited state. It’s unlikely someone symptoms sustains much damage. Headlines grab you. media requires sensationalist tone get attention 99% time reports shock cases - ones get attention. Yes young, healthy people might get ill much outliers norm. 

If look data - plenty now, mix different countries.
The vast majority people mild illness, don’t even notice all. 

The odds everyone’s favour. Even 80s underlying conditions, it’s still way likely you’re going live die. isn’t opinion. It’s simply data showing.

6 years 4k karma really speaking volumes here. Hahahaha 🤷🏿‍♀️ last movie saw theaters 1917, think would last foreseeable future.

*The Rise Skywalker* me. great film end on.

However, last dine-in like $45 sushi San Diego. *good* choice. lol  Submit. Obey. Join us. Stay safe. together. New normal. escape😷🤡  It’s wrong, “median death rate” = IFR. IFR .04% Bruh pandemic actually legit first wouldn’t anything open public whatsoever would see certain individuals wearing hazmat suits. It’s sad people brainwashed USA whatever media says believe people question ones crazy lunatic. Nah don’t wear mask never. Humans ever meant wear masks. What’s next? Dogs cats going required wears masks too?? Lmao first thought serious realized much scam is. What? infections range 20 30. virus also unable discriminate age. Lol Wait what? Brazil 54k cases one single day? saying even people recover, damage body permanent irreversible. contradict anything said. title ""weird"", wrong. Natural disasters easy. They're visual typically quite dramatic, plus usually resolved quickly.

But drag out, people get lazy scum get opportunistic.

Unfortunately, COVID19 sexy like earthquake tornado. Yeah, probs. redditor trying say thing tho. Anyway, remember use words like ""average"" context gives best opportunity it, stead words like ""median"". Using ""median death rate"" made look like new ""death rate"" instead average death rate. nice day. known many years viral infections may linked first time patient diabetes symptoms.

I quoted study’s estimation IFR. title post weird. “Median death rate” IFR Neither would bank. point? pretty bare. Nope. part disease, leftover one us mistaken would able discuss topic, come previously reached conclusions change mind would possible, much one us lying instead. here's another one: lie, unlike mistake, relies hiding/misrepresentation known information, also uses totally different mechanisms push narratives further. rarely find ""hypothetical"" lies, example, lies rarely serve purpose hypothetical context, meanwhile mistakes rife pretty much one main tools formulate prove hypothetical work. differences lie mistake motivation. there's substantial difference lies mistakes, observation derived conclusion becomes spurious, based partial information, turn misrepresents observed situation. like lie would, agree would crazy started treating like lying, right? wonder people like still exist. Go help hospital think bad flu. Major League Baseball: highest level professional baseball US. report bad based even pure logic. state 3,000 deaths age range 70 already. .04% 7,500,000. state 9 million residents, nearly million 70+ calculation virtually every single person state already covid.

I don’t know scientists pretending learn Tulsa couldn’t get airport/airline data, cruise ship pax logs, attendees BLM marches. ppl even researchers favor posting locations social media. term infection fatality rate, never brought metioned quoted it, provided definition. offend somehow?

Could protesters bunch kid age 30 virus hardly cars people? Fine, you? madman it! drained swamp! chronically ill American

sorry, developed nations allow people benefit country Ok, let explain title make sense. said ""median death age 0.04%"", wrong formulated. necessarly wrong data, using sentence saying ""my grandma 40% years old"". see? sense. sentence could something along lines of: ""The average death rate 70 0.04%"". wanted use thw eord median, context best word average. want start argument, explained why, opinion, title wrong could change it.

TL;dR: Saying ""Median death age 0.04%"" right. saying: ""My grandma 40% years old"". Try using ""The average death rate 0.04%"".  That’s amazing hear I’m glad you’re experiencing something good people. 

At wife’s work people refusing shop mask restrictions told need wear two compromised employees customers throw fits... ...ok? I’ve walked walked right grocery store didn’t require masks. Place packed maybe half people saw masks on.

Except one old guy. Kept walking right next aisle. Like dude, old you’re turn dust...I think might kinda risk thing... downvoted Texan hope right. interesting country death rates plummeting even infection rate sky rocketing...maybe nursing homes stringent procedures now? clear idea protect compromised? alone, person agrees partially: ""While agree significant proportion healthcare workers likely exposed— without confirmed RT-PCR tests it’s tenuous leap draw conclusions low proportion (4%) IgG antibodies group don’t know many fact infected virus.

The term infection fatality rate (IFR) also applies infectious disease outbreaks, represents proportion deaths among infected individuals. closely related CFR, attempts additionally account asymptomatic undiagnosed infections.[7] IFR differs CFR aims estimate fatality rate infection: detected disease (cases) undetected disease (asymptomatic tested group).[8] (Individuals infected, always remain asymptomatic, said ""inapparent"" — silent, subclinical — infections.) IFR always lower CFR long deaths accurately attributed either infected non-infected class. Northern Luzon . I’m good people aren’t going theaters anyway.

I'm Ontario, 200 cases day now, we're still locked fairly tight. even seeing family. Username checks Especially damn protests Agreed people stay distant. concern people really complying here. strategy seems push herd immunity fast possible without overloading hospitals.

Anyone calling herd immunity simply looked math.

With past vaccines (e.g. seasonal flu), need least 60% population antibodies. Since vaccine none expected near future, means 60% Americans infected COVID.

60% U.S. population 198MM people. reach that, we'd need see 200,000 new COVID cases per day, every day 33 months. would almost certainly overwhelm national hospital capacity within 6 months, possibly 3 less.

Not mention, en route reaching 60% Americans infected protect 40% ... 10MM Americans would die disease, probably more, possibly much more. would likely account deaths every war we've ever fought, plus decades worth flu deaths, combined. strong immune system Anyone understands flu-like respiratory diseases, particularly anyone studied epidemics, understands masks increase safety rates dramatically. epidemics dude's job. 

No informed scientist putting masks unless done political reasons mask shortage. tons studies show masks work. believe real studies show masks (there be, since masks clearly work). 

Fauci lying knew this. could maybe presume politician could confused. could even presume average doctor might confused. epidemics specialist like Fauci.  Common sense common sense common all. MUH RIGHTS!!, true. 
Look data coming rest world. 

The average age death Italy 82! That’s average age. 
Near 70% 60s Italy symptoms whatsoever. 

Yes young, healthy people get sick vast majority people older underlying health conditions. findings replicated world over.

The issue young people might unwittingly pass someone vulnerable. Often times, pieces shit born world two older pieces shit. less people going hospitals though, right? even point 2 correct can’t main reason. thought thought virus hoax didn’t exist mere fabrication liberal conspiracy? legal waivers thing doesn’t exist hmmm?

Anyway. Let get it. need herd immunity. Definitely made knees ache normal That's thing bugs much people try say young chances dying incredibly low. Obviously dying sucks, living another 30,40,50 years serious medical issues result covid ways worse. like bowell m&amp;ms, one poisoned. take chance, gotta throw whole bowl!

Oh God lead event songs prayer. would chorus ""America beautiful"" ?

Kind reminds B Ark Golgafrincham. also support idea. Ok close everything first place? make masks mandatory that's need. Google Dutch **not** allowed say here. certainly frustrating time anyone consistently supports taking scientific approach combating exactly, everything context. bragging high numbers testing without considering underlying numbers decides many tests needed self deceiving.

It's insane media spin governors hailed heros FL TX shit on. Wear mask else liberal deep state get mass surveillance. ""birds"" bill gates released. anyone else found forever recover? broke fever 3 weeks ago still breathing issues. Please don’t say “common sense”. Words like empower red hatters stay uneducated. think it’s common sense mask pointless violation constitutional rights. It’s really perplexing me, lack self-preservation among general population. governor going save us, fact throw us fire hope burn dollar bills, also people shouldn’t really need told wear mask go public stay away rallies right now. Yet are! Another explanation I've considered doctors hospitals encouraging people immediately get tested come treatment. Two months ago general sentiment seemed ""Don't come unless near death"". flirt Internet too. yeah. said intimate partner withstanding.

Virtual reality good meeting new people. forget religious gatherings (churches, mosques, synagogues) sometimes hugs, eating stuff, kisses drinking communal stuff. Kinda like cruise casino buffets. free. Unless count donations tithes. expensive. sign sanity desert. especially terrible since I'm 90+% sure I've Covid already. shit protect them. Buh buh buh muh rIgHtS That's even counting spreading live people attending rally. 20k people likely put another 20k risk. really see wearing mask construed weak.

Wearing mask acknowledgment vulnerable virus. Fragile egos can't handle that. Geographic representation fine good. really explain proportional version electoral college. 75% state supports candidate, count 51% does? way system set currently, voters swing states far valuable presidential candidates care far Ohio voters California North Dakota.  Lol 10 million Americans dead a-ok dude Great analogy. Imagine sniper roof randomly shooting people came in. Nobody would go shit, are.

And 'muh freedumbs' want favorite restaurant reopen problem restaurant employees wash hands using bathroom? sign collective death wish... Governments around world aren’t experimenting viruses. research labs trying understand lethal viruses. want believe?

I don’t think anyone draw definitive conclusion, don’t think possible rule fact virus could studied lab; manipulated. models show peak July massive peak September. Yeah, microscopic organisms respect guns right. think [NYT's Brazil Coronavirus Map Case might help put backlog data context. think data revised \~32.9k 6/10 (10 days ago) \~34.9k 6/16 (5 days ago) nationwide. backlog peak seem higher one before, 54k peak significantly larger rest.

Also, 999424pophis's article reported following (paraphrasing here): 19k cases spike reported 6/19 state São Paulo addition 1.2k 1.1k severe cases reported 6/17 6/18, total 21,373 cases three days. daily average \~7.1k cases per day, higher previous peak 6/2 \~7.0k. find state-wide daily case count São Paulo, sure 6/2 peak high compared days. 

The article also reported slight drop ICU occupancy rates (.8% Greater São Paulo metro area .5% state São Paulo 70.5% 66.5% respectively). 

Looking back national number removing São Paulo's backlogs 6/17 6/18 (\~7.1k cases each) 6/19 peak, still spike \~40k new daily cases. 12.5% jump previous new cases record \~35k 6/5. \~35% leap 54k cases implied, still significant.

Wouldn’t infect everyone skilled nursing facilities instead nursing homes? Stop saying “the economy” start saying “people’s jobs livelihoods ability put food tables.” Jesus Christ man reasonable serious virus also realistic effects it’s human beings beyond physical bodies. Could false negatives issue well? in, maybe there's 28 masks mandatory enforce, certain at-risk group (i.e., middle-aged, elderly, obese, pre-existing conditions, etc.) would rate low risk. use judgment. lucky people certainly need medical treatment (which think headline could improved), best estimate right puts number 35% cases. Everyone commenting “but that’s healthcare covers it” getting point.

Thanks lockdown experience resources placed clusters quickly. even that. Wearing mask means aware virus. people *still* afraid admit happening, want convince *everything okay*. Sadly, people lean hard denial, lash others represent clear threat they're trying ignore, know, people responsible wearing mask.

It's shame, we've taken something completely scientific, made political/emotional issue many people simply want admit happening.

To put like reverse governor Alabama said, California ain't Alabama.

I'm Georgia grew real close Alabama, live California. states handle same. depends bad hospitals get. can't get care, people die mean understand that'd like living country necessary, can't really speak point.

All saying point precautions imo keep spread rate overwhelm health care system. answers. Closing things/keeping closed fairly negative long term consequences well. balance. start, lockdown best that. Things definitely opened soon fast either way. Yeah rally attendees wear mask (they believe would shamed, likely), crammed together shouting, air conditioning spread virus.

Ha, kidding. State governments rather trade lives see decrease tax revenue lose votes lockdown restrictions. got threatened nationwide. risk another lockdown. Percent positive well. %+ rising, means true infections rising *faster* number tests done. %+ falling, infections rising slower number tests done. constant growth true infections tests.

Sucks old learn critical thinking. Guess we'll die another stupid, preventable illness, pretending believe it. patients aren’t ill enough need hospital need skilled nurses. Nursing homes rehabilitation floors nursing floors. aren’t elderly patients. 1. know covid causes heart attacks. people heart attacks outbreak coronavirus, may fact disease presenting itself, solely ""people ignoring less severe chest pains"".
2. states lockdowns imposed, virus yet take hold, decrease heart attacks decrease hospital visits. proof ""being scared going hospital"" led additional deaths (as stated, evidence shows exact opposite this).
3. people opting avoid medical care pandemic side effect lockdown, side effect pandemic. example, water damage apartment side effect calling fire department, side effect building fire. Got love Mr Abbott rate hospitalization peak pandemic New York 10 per 100,000 people aged 18-44 

Given wide age range, you’d expect college athletes trend closer 0-17 age risk -
At peak 1 per 100,000

The risk getting serious infection would elicit long term damage really really low.

This virus lot terrible things, terrible things seem come age  would board plane Really reads like gaslighting. Sure. thought film critics watched special pre-release DVDs home? Welcome Nashville. Yes, densely populated countries older populations worse death rate. grateful bad. Nonetheless, seems pretty stupid argue bad possible, pandemic deadly, pandemic. fact, I'm pretty sure death cult members would make sort shitty argument.

And oh look, Trump enablers making precisely argument. Right queue.

Y'all broken inside. thing I'm thankful about, whole terrible mess, ugly people finally showing true colors permanent online record. I’ve Myrtle Beach, there’s ton bars indoor places people go to. like Mardi Gras could, probably wouldn't. could ask doctor's certificate/note saying need accommodation. need spell why. Everything happened NYC happen South. wish well hope band together stay safe, gut says compeltly utterly fucked. ""American""?  know Brazil, US hospitalization went nation wide elective surgeries postponed people much less likely go get seen hospital. top social distancing quarantine greatly reduced number normal infections number injuries caused things like car accidents. right saw 0.007 thought lower actually means 0.7% thanks evidence beginning. We’ve ton kids hospitalized NY die. coronavirus, illness mirrors Kawasaki disease.

It’s worry recover immune system flair start attacking blood vessels coronary arteries. I’m also health care seen first hand. People hang ICU weeks weeks. Look actor baby son.

From book Covidius 20:19. weareth mask cannot speak. cannot speak cannot heard. cannot herd cannot **spread** almighty ~~virus~~ gospel freedoms bequeathed Almighty find funny? yep this.. can't handle pandemic.. can't handle climate change people thinking going colonize space good portion certain type Americans seriously stupid willfully ignorant Uh, no? TSA ever prevented terrorist attack? point ""cure"" would say time get life? Healthcare cost anyone anything.  Overall, US infection rate 0.7%, 0.6% means Delta fairly representative country. It’s good know airlines, business close contact lots people, don’t unusually high infection rate Really depends news outlet look at. Things pretty peachy (or overblown) follow Fox talking head narrative. Make no-mask viewing later day, keep different theatres. ones near like 20+ damn screening rooms. F'ing douchebags reinstate Crozier.  Americans ignore many things. Get line science. Florida’s recent press conference broke median age new infections 30s. Bam protestors forgot pandemic too. Goes ways. Criminal sympathizers subreddit? surprises here. 100% bad news. did. Every similar outbreak past seen masks tend effective. Absolute worst case scenario people wearing masks need to. Big deal. one harmed. kind people live Florida. Haha, speak code, but, yes, agree everything said, sorry clear. corporate media pretty much equally bad, despite superficial Ok reporting, sometimes. wish would already. I’m NYC incredibly worried wealthy, fled March, coming back city continues reopen. Everyone stir crazy months stay home order cold spring everyone coming outside traveling summer getaways. hope I’m wrong. Triaging supplies makes sense. time, weren’t recommending masks public explanation they’re helpful preventing wearer infection (except N95’s). Later, PPE catching up, they’re saying wear masks prevent wearer inadvertently spreading it. two concepts true, different angles issue two different triage contexts. 

Not really seeing lied. first, shouldn’t. Now, should. think someone suggested cloth masks early on, actually novel recommendation come fairly quickly. really appreciate showing bombastically spread ignorance, worldwide quarantine helped us avoid worst case scenario, mean pandemic fake news. really means understand epidemiology.

Don't worry though, everyone else conversation knows you. could clear words. nursing homes meat packing plants 

Pretty much theme everywhere NA world. role government lol job protect ppl, lockdowns cuz ppl like refuse willingly math's off. That's death rate .7%. hmmmm.. epidemic? Sharing drinks. cause huge shortage. could've told people wear cloth masks, N95 masks emphasized cloth masks good (which kind general public). Instead, told people wear masks people still sticking that. adding UV lights needed solve problem hard time believing it’s already done Rising lower point, yes, cases nationally previously higher now. Ya think? point asteroid wipe planet Earth get vaccine. exciting! 

I really hope get point effective treatment make one ends ventilator. know, pretending deadly pandemic deadly pandemic really stupid hill die on. president, you.

But then, thread Americans long term memories, covet 19 perfect vector kill them. Thanks proving everyone else right. Medications? medications? That, too! See thing is, aren't. horribly misunderstood everyone thinks ""Whitmer's Executive order puts Covid patients nursing homes."" flat false sort digging.

The actual orders question nursing home home patients came Covid leave facility go hospital. order said ""facilities must designated wing ward Covid positive nursing home patients returning home mix general population.""

The real crimes things need investigation entire nursing home industry. profit allows bad things happen care wise people dying homes Covid homes taking steps required Whitmers order mixing returning nursing residents Covid positive general population.

Now lot people want argue 20 year old home Covid positive beat elderly man. People say put home cause order. Again, little bit digging show incorrect.

This 20 year old history mental health issues even Covid around group homes assisted living conditions.

Everyone wants use fathers quote ""he there."" argument without including whole thing. father meant home at. supposed quarantined home even moved technically.

I got huge argument last night. give minute browse history cause I'll link article confirming everything say. need second cause still copied clipboard. 

This massive case hating Whitmer evidence defer actual offender, nursing home question.

Edit: remove political party name allowed. Also link talking going detail 20 year old particular home. argument people use basis hysteria one mink farm, animals must initially gotten HUMANS, minks captives without access exposure cruel handlers, passed back humans- call BULLSHIT.  I'm guessing sports happen next year.

Maybe. revenge?  . . . USA put cards face asked: ""so, play this, ask another card? double bid?"" I’m certain. I’m saying evidence develop immunity it. Proof isn’t concept science. matter strong evidence, always possibility theory disproven. plenty *evidence* supporting claim humans develop immunity covid. yet see *proof* contrary. 

There little reason believe virus special happens one rare ones can’t develop immunity against. immunity develop may short lived, original claim stated absolutes don’t align reality, scientific method. learned authoritarians, authoritarian enablers, never, ever, ever arguing good faith. raised two them, family full them, community rife them, never known anyone chucklefucks earnestly single subject, even penalty death.

It's almost part genuine, part authoritarian cannot coexist time.

Anyway, reading he's trying bamboozle stupid people thinking ""the media"" promoting left wing conspiracy deadly pandemic deadly pandemic. Good, private company enforce whatever rules want. Dr.s Fauci Birx Surgeon General lie effectiveness mask usage start mask wearing ever beome political issue. know. apologize response little top. venting frustration cultural explanations general, seem used rationalize every possible outcome country I've watched closely. said, I'll definitely agree East Asians existing norm wearing masks pandemics probably made better prepared slow outbreaks respective countries compared Westerners. athletes. numerous coaches, trainers, refs go along NCAA football? young and/or athletic shape. Herd immunity probably happen much lower population. number assumes effective R 3-4 prior changes behavior. effective R right probably 1-1.5, meaning less 1/3 population infected needed.

They ~90,000 positives, maybe upwards million actually infected already, they’re 1/6th way there! think you’re right may see 10,000/day unless behaviors change. Ummm good news. mean unless sadist. Americans fat. breathing problems even without masks. said, need wearing them. know takes couple weeks see hospitalizations increase along positive testing right? Overall found article interesting, especially part compared number deaths last year ones year time, see much excess death have. gives us good idea much reported corona deaths really are.

However happy take account certain kinds deaths went significantly down. without corona deaths expect lot less deaths last year time, amount. reporting problem probably even bigger study súggests.

Now talking ? Mainly 2 areas came mind, might even more. would like look see many deaths less. exact numbers since statistics yet, bu,t :

1. workplace accidents : many people either losing job, getting furloughed, working home lot less deadly work place accidents. example construction alone like 1000 deaths year, projects put ice quarantine, number deaths gone close zero time.

2. one drastic number, big one : death traffic. Everybody road lockdown noticed much less cars roads. people working home lost job, plus drives vacations, many drives sports (hello soccer mums name one example) recreational activities happen traffic go 80% many areas, even 90%. think dramatic amount accidents less means. Almost 40.000 people lost life traffic 2019, average 3400 month. Even halved numbers ( could easily gone much traffic,so 10%-20 % be), easily see making significant number deaths less, take account. excellent point don’t think gets enough attention. Americans act like it’s fault suffering, somewhat true, virus spreads putting countries worked hard control virus risk fresh outbreaks too. 

Most countries implemented travel restrictions US, long? 2018 Americans spent $144 billion international tourism. I’m sure many economically struggling countries eventually decide let us in. let citizens travel US, third visited country normal times, risk bring virus back Office buildings aren’t bad long people stay offices. person meetings around table. going people’s offices. sanitize multiple times day. yeah bars restaurants, stupid. Obviously people remove masks eat people drink start loosing common sense. Let’s start hanging people, get right face practically yell spit flies. Aren’t MLS players Disneyland Orlando rn? context deadly virus, controlled population prison environment almost every inmate exposed virus, 14 2000 people die make fatality rate lower 0.01% Ikr Like actual work guys give warning obvious. wish stories shared. People going start dumping pets worse... Yea care abandoned harmed animals MF Karen anti-maskker agenda. New Orleans, half shops French Quarter leave doors open AC blasting inside even COVID. can't imagine much costs. Yeah I'll never truly know bothers me. aside medical reasons, I'm 'stay fuck home' type even go groceries. stuff delivered disinfect everything. helps introvert crazy times haha. People Florida don’t take cruises it’s people outside Florida come Florida get cruise ship.

Even right amount state tourists town crazy. I’ve seen many license plates NY/NJ/MA past week. Quit Vacationing middle global pandemic!!!! flu season even started yet lol patient died family ""misbehaved"" hospital staff. Sounds right. Entitled folks trying avoid manslaughter charge Yeah, flu doesn’t mess blood vessel systems throw clots brain. (And yes, happened people 40 without compromised immune systems) intentionally tried keep politics disgusting comment. (Usually fruitful avenue, lol) care cruise lines polluting much, plenty things do. Stop eating seafood number one. 

Fishing responsible 10% plastic polluting oceans every year, close million tons year, astronomical damage fish populations, including fish they’re even trying catch. “Bycatch”, it’s called fishing industry, often includes endangered species like sea turtles, dolphins, at-risk sea animal populations. 

To clear, want cruises end permanently. really care pollution/destruction, make simple choose end own! promise, won’t miss it. Stop eating seafood months walk fish counter grocery store. won’t smell appetizing...lol. 0 deaths new cases, go even more. question is: think less deaths new cases? MIL created Facebook event family reunion September noted “only” 70 people worry virus.... world reach 180.000 new cases yesterday, increase 30.000 day before. 33 new cases seems bit enthousiastic. Bleach IV drip powerful light shining ass. work med surg unit large hospital. cared various recovering COVID patients. One particular us 3-4 weeks, spent 2 weeks ICU prior that. arrived could get own, could barely scoot bed. walking short distances &amp; could speak full sentences getting winded time left unit inpatient rehab still tracheostomy. I’ve also heard many stories patients &amp; seen stats. 

I’ve one confirmed exposure virus. bf RN &amp; also confirmed exposure. Thankfully neither us caught it. friend nursing school unfortunately catch caring patients COVID unit another state, still recovering hospitalized. blessed. Honestly can't really agree. I'm country temps run high 80's / low 90's extremely humid makes feel like 100f easily. Yeah wearing mask climate particularly comfortable, make jump extremely uncomfortable? Dunno bro. Sounds like people making excuses. Wish people realized this. number positive cases important percentage really looking determine things getting better. think cases, necessarily deaths virus Ro (?) #, mortality percentage go bit. used years ago (and insulin that) I'm diet now. A1C always around 6! tool help produce calorie deficit, deficit that's resulting lost weight know many types of, ways be, funny. Right?

Well obviously don't.

But explanation funny. laughed, little. okay I'm sure Trump voters voted go bankrupt due medical emergency family. they'll fine get bill $100,000 going hospital COVID related care. Oh wait talking first world country healthcare all. Never mind there's going lot people going financial difficulty medical bill funeral costs. Bolsanaro gettin schwifty Brazil. I'm curious know cat accidents... Forgot mention that's blood clotting disorder, I'm blood thinners life well IVC filter implant (the PE clot prior that, 8 years ago found disorder). I'm pretty attuned body know get clots anymore super rare. shortness breath biggest sign. guess could chart rise social media would same. Social media relies metrics. Even think ""likes"" constant votes. Even here, upvote, downvote. People upvote things good logical arguments help th discussion. upvote things confirm personal beliefs ""right."" read guns, germs steel? Oh no... going bad India people (75%) low income living urban slums rural areas poor healthcare. 


For country aircraft carrier, space program nuclear weapons one wonder priorities society.  bull. I'm Ron DeSantis fan, go FL hospital consortium's website see hospitals state stressed all. can't wait great grandchildren go tearing statues of, say, Bill Clinton, unabashed meat-eater society changed point eating meat considered cruel barbaric. cares blooping noises pond scum makes? use A/C indoors? look total excess mortality CDCs website see Florida largely spared far. Covid 2020 looks roughly equivalent 2017-18 flu. couse, would higher lockdowns, excess mortality FL year nothing compared Michigan New York. except covid19 deplete cells remove Well would never eat bowel anything. Ha! Former danish colonies. isn’t stated article. Blame freaking boss look mirror. lack certainty good reason cautious fatality rate. lot famous atheletes right now. see field, see syndrome real life. It'll take months restart IMO northeast second wave. Also, another state going bad outbreak, media coverage going dominate instinctively people cautious seeing hurt. Also, people primarily wear masks indoors go stores, work, stuff. large, people need wear masks outside couple coca colas!

w r h already there.

It’s established National Union, hasn’t done whole lot, immense power uses it.

Most trusted profession America absolute power make huge changes small actions simply use power.  predictions mortality # people probably infected event? google skills lacking can't find numbers. idiots this? one hand attempting moral browbeat people wanting forced wear mask applauding ""protesters"" gather arm arm mass herds.

I guess saying goes ""if leftists double standards they'd standards all"" true. didn’t test positive though. 

Just sad story. worry, torn 100 years society changes discovered ""meat-eaters"" longer considered ethical. thank wearing one totally agree position fines. However, think argument they're hard breath work mostly psychological. people really pain butt use people glasses and/or full beards glasses fog easily beard push mask towards eyes hair mouth. said, wear glasses, humongous beard, deviated septum makes harder breath general... masks small nuisance best. incredible bother people want wear make be. 

A piece advice though, wear glasses, absolutely need masks adjustable nose pieces like surgical masks do. Masks without fog glasses time. taste I've read subreddit. looking chart portraying CUMULATIVE DEATHS, goober. people start getting resurrected, number cumulative deaths increase. OMG ...  People gonna freak-da-f-out say ""it's mah right, MAH face"". Flabamastan. Remindme! 21 days Imagine Guilt. streaming services alone can’t pay new films headed theaters. Blockbusters crazy expensive make expect giant returns globally. ticket prices dropped may consider fair, don’t expect see big budget films. confirm.. . Strong ppl don’t let powerful dictate morals sure joking, facemasks required indoors. country coronavirus free month. wore mask. last week new case popped up, theres 30 active ones. idiots.. always wear mask straight fake news. I'm Ron DeSantis fan, look Florida hospital consortium's data see hospitals stressed all. trust eating out. many restaurants/ carry out/ drive thrus tested positive. Plus, T-rump made drive thrus open priority (wendy's, McDonald's, kfc,etc.) instead things, know something there. Apart picking curbside, I've leaving house little. also drive semi tanker trucks delivering raw milk regional. whole lot contact anyone I'm usually treating whole affair like camping trip. Masks gloves fueling anytime outside.

As far family friends town goes, family lives back CA(I'm NM) living town eight years, I'm much asshole developed friendships/hangout buddies ""drop unexpectedly"". tried befriend me, political beliefs overly exaggerated displays rural manliness made shut rather quickly harshly.

I'm less ghost around here. fauci said he's wearing mask symbol compassion / solidarity dumb dumb red hats took means masks BS. Idk possibly change minds half country. dumb listen reason. know I'm willing bet already passed it, underreported. Yet enforcement... need take grain salt, that’s all. anecdotals all. Nothing done. Ok first play halftime political rally full attendance Tulsa Oklahoma conveniently near Texas currently outbreak mode. Also, masks necessary. Coach Trump really solid gameplan one Lord's work. Check map. Tulsa RIGHT NEXT Osage reservation. don’t want think it. really worry virus hit hardest 2nd 3rd infection endemic immunity temporary. fucking virus worst. WISH lived alone, stress anxiety came irresponsible housemates thought going carelessly infect deadly virus. neon sign rod ass. Currently mandated across California... 95% people ignoring it. sad, really. attempts shoot corona, would shooting person carrying it. Simple logic regarding virus spreads dictates would need dispatch host order truly defeat corona present door. You’re feeble minded believe otherwise. waiver BMS website lists health guidance fans attending. includes possible temperature health question screenings prior entry. Mask-wearing also encouraged.

Campgrounds around track say they’re trying help mitigate spread spacing campers.

“We’re going handwashing stations, portable toilets, shower house cleaned often. areas get touched often cleaned regularly,” said Aaron Earhart, co-owner Earhart Campground.

How many masks see? portable toilets cleaner? people answer health questions honestly knowing go home sick? ""particularly vulnerable""? exposure previous viruses give rest world added protection Corona isolated tribes vulnerable? comparable, cruise particularly enclosed yes, awareness precautions addition food dining service, low ceiling tight room etc..
Sad fact probably never get clear picture good, bad indifferent given everybody seems skewing everything. swear everyone politicizing this, sides, one day smacked stick. True, I'm building courage. Also, 12 straight days zero cases hometown..

I'm saying virus serious people ease precautions, opposite! case different depending are. true. That's pretty crazy experience Michigan, every since around Memorial Day stay home lifted I've noticed people wearing masks distancing minority. experience I'd say 70% people following distancing wearing masks now. 

Obviously area hope whole every else well say. Well second part true, can't get second wave u never end first one parents live Cudjoe keep checking make sure wearing masks.... ""we're healthy!"" ok, mom, youre almost 70, I'm worried still would want safety modifications though. Instead dining hall cookout food. serve pavillion get walls yes roof.

And expo hall located pavillion too. AMV show anime movies held night outdoors. People seated drive-in movie theatre style. even conservative activists want take us back 1800s? Oh wow...those comments worse expected. wonder Fox News ever moral convictions they're world thinks, ""you know maybe this."" Surely actually believe half crap opinion mouthpieces spew profit. really create monsters. Epicenter good word. I'm glad people daily vocabulary now. assume people wear masks also dont use condoms. 🤢 Let’s talk compassion. Maybe would compassionate took mental health increase suicides consideration discussing public health issues, didn’t use straw man argument criticize don’t wear masks say nice person wear mask. courteous, it’s simply tool used. Discussions like freedom vs public health psychological vs physiological health need discussed. Things like seeing people’s smile order communicate effectively matter talking mental health. Yes it’s crazy Florida amount tourists right now. amount NY/NJ/MA plates I’ve seen past week higher normal. Quit vacationing middle pandemic!!! think cases continue climb, deaths going go down.

I think lot older folks bit conscious virus, also old people’s homes careful well. keep mortality bit lower beginning. Yes was. 320 million people America last election 50/50. think 160 million people want defund/abolish police 160 million want fly confederate flag, bozo. reminds story hear people say this. 


A fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help. 
Soon man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you.""

The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me.""

So rowboat went on. 
Then motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you.""

To stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So motorboat went on. 
Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""

To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""

To God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter, expect?"" everyday someone math. you’re looking change motto “the sickest place earth,” way it. Man, irrationally pissed ugly statue is.

Oh yes does. get hot there... Wolf wolf's clothing wolf sheep's clothing last sentence it. We're already seeing effects today, worst yet come. 

There's big part US population willfully, almost indignantly, tries educate themselves. result, get idiots feeling simple cloth paper mask, surprisingly effective stopping transmission deadly virus, somehow infringing right never cared Trump refused wear mask. 

More likely, people believe climate change hoax. think there's nothing worry about, need change personal consumption habits vote differently. Nobody says  Dems waiting for. chance even playing field next election lot Trump's base perishes today... regards kids- CDC guidelines- kids 2 aren’t recommended cloth face covering all. haven't, about? not. look real Asthma society websites, recommend masks. Dumbest thing ever. Maybe get super creepy transparent masks development. READ Don’t worry guys, it’s fading away. hundred thousand it’ll gone. can't get full article. Let guess, Kucshner behind this?  looks like everywhere needs follow spike slow decline get it. Areas without spike drop get result instantly reopening anyway. It’s unavoidable, continually locking reopening next year isn’t sustainable. explanation ~ look many people saying yes rallies face masks Tulsa. 

Polls stupid ~ always biased. varies age overwhelmed health system is. people U.S. died *with* COVID-19 killed WW1. Fixed you. Wanes? ever popular? much cover up, difference estimated deaths (always higher) confirmed/incremental deaths.

But get incremental deaths realtime (the 120k figure) whereas estimated deaths accurately assessed fact. matter. think bar abide rules. people resisting. watch stage cam awhile see security telling people keep masks on. US cases 33,530 yesterday


Canada 409 cases yesterday Australian ICU banned fans well COVID 19 infection hazard. laughed ass off...until realized money. report acquired immunity may temporary, known unknown. Fox highly regarded polls, it’s different news channel say, see old people around acting nothing wrong think increase positive testing rate catching mild cases?  I'm trying understand makes people coming contact infected people results less deaths. Seems like magical thinking got us ""it'll soon 0 cases"" ""only 60k deaths"". portion heart attacks directly people succumbing covid. larger portion, imo, caused stress fear associated global pandemic lockdown followed.

The psychological impact covid presents cannot understated, symptoms fall line million common issues. Cough, fever, sore throat, gi pain, rash, pink eye. wonder point niggling issue covid? stress, addition economic uncertainty lockdown, fear going hospital, created perfect storm uptick heart attacks. converse true well, many people sick covid believed something else, stayed home late. That’s don’t get though. born modern society born system laws/rules constantly telling ( know reason). stop stop signs, filing taxes, also can’t walk around naked, mean can’t walk around naked? /s . It’s strange sudden people want oppose rebel “the system” wear mask middle pandemic. want see real rebel fighters, read comments YouTube video regarding mandatory face masks enjoy. never said cases going testing. I'm saying positive rate right way lower March/April 30K cases 2K deaths maybe many deaths time around. top symptims red angry rash feet least you’re excellent writer. Bruh that’s next level shit Well guess cases spread compared Long Island. systems nyc Long Island area we’re getting overwhelmed. Also death toll lags behind weeks. Turn rides fear-based ones... developed potent amounts magical thinking protect themselves.  logic noone commission statue. always thought that's surgeons it, understanding want coughing sneezing expose organs. know everything else talking about, want dig deeper looks gates involvement Corona Virus. Corporations experimenting corona sense 90's apparently. 

There also theory basically states weaponized order control Hong Kong riots. 

I'm sure whether not, ALOT weird facts look developers Pandemic Inc, make new setting game:

Real Life Mode: People idiots refuse even basic things survive. Turns virus doesn’t care you’re red blue (but politics influence decision follow public health guidelines, might care little bit). wasn’t. another human cold... nurses Tulsa spelled backwards ""a slut"" We’ll never know many people actually died India. normal non pandemic time 1/4 deaths determined cause. 

They’re testing, hospitals flooded extent people dying parking lots. they’re beginning. read water cooler first feel like coloring it. Statues look best monotone gray think 2020 one thing next reality it’s one big Bloons TD game likely, real number probably far higher 120k since government actively trying cover That’s it’s meant sail to!

Lol that's like walking gravel barefoot complaining feet hurt

But refusing put shoes He's dishonest saying anyone listen anti-science.  We're anti-liars.  admitted intentionally lying wearing masks knew would prevent spread wear them.  decided fuck public told us wear them. People states require pants getting sick wearing pants. continues wearing mask around people public, certainly will. really need much material respond properly virus. Case point, Vietnam Thailand. used lot field (house-to-house),and poll takers still do, it’s expensive. Hospitalization death 8 days average, IIRC. I'm glad use Arizona worst part fear virus lowest now. People dismissing ""the young die"" Part cases New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, heavily hit regions way going really heavy restrictions. 

We’re starting see massive surge cases places like Arizona, Texas, Florida going week delay since it’s going take weeks infected pass away looks like clay animation character, bad way. 100000 better options I'm sure. Smdh US, unplug vent hospital like 26529 alarms go off. something quietly. typically patients fine one minute takes set everything. New York epicenter virus US seeing first spike 35.000 new cases per day numbers accompanied 2500 deaths per day. makes sense people wondering new spike 'only' brings 750 deaths. course.....

Just check numbers Part better treatment, also remember deaths tend lag 2-3 weeks behind infection reports. 

So, death counts stay low next month, things changed earlier pandemic. Humanity it. mostly Americans fucking up. stats say average, new case death 2 weeks. Hospitalization death 8 day, IIRC. Open eyes, can’t take deep breath, see Except *is* valid strategy, seeing yielding positive results. positive like. 

The strategy valid, working even Sweden's late reaction scenario. argue strategy *optimal* Sweden's scenario, yielding positive results.

This distinction important make, otherwise country might discard strategy future outbreaks, end using far excessive strategy instead. Bolsonaro charged mass murder dismissive, anti-science attitude led thousands needless deaths. 1 mill applied go one rally, would say polls reliable snake oil cure rona y'all come people seem wear mask? live best even find someone mask lol Everybody gets venue IDd put list. Hen think Coronavirus deaths pass 666?  Finally good [*redacted kids world*] news  Source? lying specifically? surprised. I'm extremely anti cloth masks. I'd follow stuff. Desantis playing lip service 'preparedness' Ouch. contained, still locked down!

It's contained locked down... Canada. I'd feel confident regards future COVID sharing border US. dropping ball completely kind scary see. CFR cumulative current total deaths / current confirmed cases

I literally talking CFR. Swedish CFR says nothing anything. Who’s they? Northern Michigan never hit hard corona 3 week old vaccines immunity get either third trimester, mother's colostrum post-birth. countries expecting parents given free anti-natal classes. crazy seeing stories. literally ran 5 miles 4 days symptoms started appear. Yea, like China jail people protesting. force lockdown apartments allowing essentials day, prevent leaving city’s. 

I mean wtf tyranny anyways right? needs rights. microwave disinfecting steam bags might effective well. I’m sure buy maybe baby aisle store use household. Western Michigan here. I'd say 1/20 Walmart shoppers wear masks. really pisses off. 100% this. liability issue health/security theater. Yeah mask course didn’t. Came home immediately washed face/hands/arms super well, nothing else point. ask people stay away get close it’s impossible avoid exposure point attest, senior week dope 

Kinda late tho I'd love settle mask shit all. Put non mask group non symptomatic covid pts see spread rates cloth vs unclothed demographics. People would paid them. Nothing new live Orlando, yesterday line convention center testing site, 30 minutes opening, 5 hour wait. masks worked well, therefore need masks! Wait what? Ithink there's lot fraud grift going cdc recommend glory holes prevent transmissions? FL could get 40,000 cases day still wouldnt it, ole Ron doesnt want nasty tweet him, telling hes low energy etc, 

Just look states thing, TX, AZ, AL numbers going up, doubling the, fine testing showing numbers, 

Your elected officials states, flat dont give toss citizens. literally showed say that. point airborne. study address public use rate transmission - viral load droplets. not, way, show general mask use effective preventing spread influenza public. fact found 8% reduction transmission linked public mask wearing rule random chance explaining reduction.

It actually wasnt felt better, bike anymore. days sore throat headache cleared tried bike, stop promptly puked gasping air.

Thankfully thats gotten better, took months. Coronavirus agrees... simplemindedness comments makes shake head sometimes masks effective people like claim, wouldn’t someone able go out? watching Belmont Stakes...they cut live shots Times Square times....each time deserted.

There's less zero evidence that. respiratory virus become lodged respiratory tract. gall claim zero evidence airborne transmission providing contact tracing data, reading studies traces existed months now, participating studies contact tracing advocacy U.S.

I'm fairly certain cause, like saying wear masks, saying surfaces primary source eventually shown complete bullshit.

In general situation quite good; blip new daily cases last three days almost related meat packing industry.

To make long story short, sensationalist headline really related reality. choosing live made fantasy land facts matter. Pl Closed places safe, thing outside. pants also voluntary? Asking friend... lives inside pants feels awfully suffocated! friend went friend's house last Saturday socializing .... monday, she, husband, young daughter got sick tested positive covid19. turns husband friend carrier passed everyone evening except wife. one extremely sick young 12 year old daughter hospital. collective attention span limited 3 hours, regularly scheduled commercial breaks. want us really pay attention covid, Netflix needs make series binge remain focused ten hours.

Neither Trayvon Martin Ahmed Aubrey killed police. 

""His vivid murder comes number deaths Black Americans hands police: Breonna Taylor, Ahmed Aubrey, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Rayshard Brooks, many others"" trend map. uses metrics. look numbers go calculation really misleading. Wish would make mandatory AL. record breaking added cases overnight, still state wide mandated requirement. wish would be, people definitely wearing masks around parts. post locked due purely political nature responding comments. Except American scientists, apparently, since they're petitioning paper removed. say there's conclusive evidence airborne.

Then scientist, Linsey Marr said twitter, basically, ""Oh yeah? There's evidence mode transmission then."" I'm assuming meant based upon criteria ""conclusive"" move goal posts depending narrative trying sustain.

Currently, seems, want back possibility outdoor transmission nearly non existent well surface transmission, there's even LESS evidence airborne transmission. 

They find active viral particles surfaces, yes, can't explain person gets respiratory tract could possibly account contact traced outbreaks. instance, South Korean call center outbreak, infected would sneezing break area day without cleaning - then, everyone would touch surfaces shove fingers nose. Meanwhile, somehow, account fact 900+ people building somehow never got elevator buttons countless interactions people outbreak ridden 11th floor. Surface transmission explain outbreaks could occur, restaurant Wuhan outbreak choir practice breaks especially. makes even LICK sense they're airborne. 

Instead, scientists U.S. get paid show MSNBC CNN every night bleat shaming entire states full people without ever sourcing caution gets old zero context provided via contact tracing zero time spend broadcasts delineating safe, less safe, totally unsafe activities. outrage.

Oh, time scientists tv, treated countless shots beaches outdoor activities. yet see unnecessary office meeting (offices states rising numbers open), subway car bus ride work, networking event - venues South Korea earmarked dangerous spread...

IN MARCH. apparently way much ask 72% approval rating. one biggest obvious tragedies outbreak. better world, Trump would realized could make lot money putting campaign billboards face every one supporters. Trump could quickly normalized mask wearing, even things open transmission rates could stifled. 

Instead, are. TIL “lakh” 100.000 (also written 100,000 parts world) Anti-natal? in, antinatalism movement? antenatal, care child birth? shoes stores, assume. know someone died it, brother one closest friends, 30's tragic.But guess what? economy human. economy dies- humanity dies, least shit apocalyptic that's sure.

Get fucked. science become subordinate political optics?

Climate scientists would like word… stay home Intel hate strong here. One problem mandatory mask ordinances written various exemptions, like health exemptions instance. anti-mask crazies learned say health condition like asthma store go even masks otherwise required. I've heard they're magical fruit. you’re wearing mask point, you’re twat labeled such. It’s minor inconvenience could save lives. that’s enough reason, shamed. Like said, you’re clueless dumbass. don’t know ability $50.00 says IBS Crohn's Disease. willing human sacrifice made science. arbitrary date.

""Unless rescinded extended subsequent act Board,

Sure, errors determining potential error? That's become issue, number p-hacking articles late believed. bottom line saying ""science truth"" Orwellian best, never heard lips supposed scientists atop NIAID. shows worrisome fundamental lack understanding regarding science truth are. Deaths July 13-19 vs. June 15-21 Thanks, let know do! Rocky Top you’ll always be, home sweet home meee, good ole Rocky Top, Woo!

Interesting Quebec locked hard early, Sweden didnt lock .. yet ended similar situation. Lots deaths nursing homes, deaths outside that.

Almost like main issue whether lock down, manage protect seniors. Dude idk that's possible that's literally area called. born stupid? parent comment referring comments article. 

Comments jokes. 


Jokes taken seriously. 


You cannot stupid mean read fucking parent thread.  number call from? helpful know answer junk calls get. problem flu it’s *nearly* infectious COVID-19. Let’s say 2x deadly— number may seem small, comparing many people get flu vs many people get COVID/year *very* significant. mention vaccine flu. 

I think human lives much important economy. guess change mind you’d infected know someone is/has died it. said, you’re okay people dying, doesn’t mean they’re okay haha. wonder perspective would change someone particularly risk. correct saying is... north go Florida, Southern gets. 

Brooksvillle, Ocala, Williston, etc Yeah, honestly pretty shocked reading it. assumptions survive peer review, course, public know that. they'll remember headline. Tell conversation I’m trying hard have. Give interpretation, please. Man, really hate math science you. supposed calculate this? Like three weeks take 7 day average? Ozzie Harriet tell Eddie Haskell behave. don’t wear really. wear help prevent spread someone vulnerable. Yeah, made pretty clear. Everyone entitled opinion respect yours, well.

Have great weekend! Someone call Lauren Balsamo (the coughing Karen) let know antibodies probably matter! think agenda (if look Twitter) promoting himself. still understand conversation trying hard have.  course did. election year end day thst going take priority. Youd rather devastated country win, better country lose. “An accompanying report AHCA shows 75 percent available hospital beds statewide currently occupied.” According NIH study 2005-2007, unique current situation. sensationally headlined article certainly makes seem way.

From NIH study: “The percentage ICU beds cohort occupied ICU patients given hour ranged 57.4% 82.1% ... three years (Figure 1). Mean hourly occupancy change three years 68.2% (± 21.3) 2005 70.4% (± 22.8) 2007 (P = 0.25) (eTable 1).” also, “The mean hourly occupancy ICUs 68.2% ± 21.3, median 74.6% (IQR 53.4–86.1%, full range 17.4% 109.0%) (Figure 2; eTable 2).”

Here link study. 

My point 75% occupancy rate ICUs far unusual unique coronavirus. fact, looks fairly typical. say hospitals are”running ICU beds” lacks historical context nothing attempt generate readership sensationalist headline frightens people well beyond level legitimate concern prudent caution. rescind ordinance literally time. June 2021 arbitrary placeholder.

""Unless rescinded extended subsequent act Board, 
ordinance shall sunset June 1, 2021, subject quarterly review."" ""Your side""? Wtf even taking about? virus gives zero shits political alignment is. Without downvoting oblivion someone explain face masks? helps prevent spreading virus that’s 100% cooperate. Let’s say everyone cooperated there’s new cases month masks longer required. next day it’s almost guaranteed new case lockdown? Lockdown already India pretty much. trying make understand big clueless dumbass are. seems working since keep taking bait. feel like clueless dumbass? sound like one. Americans, stupid people
They ignoring fact people keeps dying everyday, cause don’t give shit people’s life fucking selfish unless happens pro-sexual-shaming picking hospital, already it/your day bad enough already.

Here's hoping come that. Lockdown enforceable, depends much governments willing middle word.... force. point .. Sweden wasnt *terrible*. 

What would expect, horror stories told happen country doesnt lock down, Sweden would *nightmare*.

We would expect every country didnt lock much worse countries lock down.

And that's case. Apparently possible lock down, still .. ""ok"". overflowing hospitals. mountains corpses. second study makes many poor assumptions. terrible. assume HCWs they'd infected. Let's make bet. weekly deaths 3 weeks vs. week. take 3 weeks now, take week. conversation last several posts now. hope making feel better. time Reddit! Nice. headline misleading. June 2021 completely arbitrary date.

 actual last written states:

It’s nice place. family friend’s it’s much fantasy. nowhere near herd immunity, even remotely close, unless spreads completely control anywhere near come winter. Uncontrolled spread would result millions deaths that's option. time controlled spread would achieve herd immunity we'll already vaccines. Easier point examples bad science used push fucked agendas. trump says people wear masks signal hate him. Talk ego fucking make masks mandatory. Literally that's need keep control. People still get infected prevent spread significantly. Japan didnt shit besides widespread adoption masks control.

Bro don’t even comment brainwashed 😂😂 Jesus Christ thought governor Iowa dumb.... gee wonder happened last 2-3 weeks could sparked uptick cases. political science conspiracy theorists: foreign powers paid US government promote no-mask policy order reduce US population international influence.

Change Lebron Kanye selling $600 mask holes protests masks &amp; social distancing. I, too, saw pics lot protests weren’t many masks. Personally, think it’s good protest (Even though equal rights important cause) pandemic. Crowds aren’t good. Without every person wearing mask without social distancing, outbreaks seeded. People protested people didn’t protest end sick. maybe dead. 

I think future masks mandatory fines wearing them. also think guidance Americans science says wear masks wear mask properly. 

I’m tired science matter convenience country. feel like lot people listen science it’s convenient fits want do. 

Tired wearing mask? Yell freedom wear mask. Except country, aren’t allowed drive drunk might kill someone. wear mask reason- don’t wear mask, might kill someone.

It sucks. Wearing mask sucks. It’s better killing someone. vaccine/treatment, saving people getting sick then. 

Can count glad keep six feet away people, though. lot people dont even know that.

I watch people take masks eat table. I've given pointless. Wear mask want.  give crap person. leave alone stay 6ft away. look details.

Fist mask mask. would board would MAKE CLOTH MASKS GETS announcement. RIP moderators lmao fucking assholes got USA couple years ago like planned. I've lost much thanks dipshit culture care anymore. country ruined life. one downvote you’re correct. India’s data clearly indicates lockdown didn’t work. daily numbers consistently increased throughout lockdown period afterwards hospital strain prove increase testing related. 

As far lockdowns effective worth long-term countries (China, much Europe, New Zealand) ineffective harmful others (those stories Indian migrant workers heartbreaking) subject future study. would guess India’s poverty large, dense population makes social distancing unrealistic tool fight disease with. perhaps it’s poor enforcement. friend studied abroad India host family routinely bribed cops said completely normal thing India. whatever reason, you’re right, lockdown work hope India find another way fight pandemic could somehow save hospitals let people maintain livelihoods. I'm going respond couple things seems like lot responses really warrant actual rebuttal since nothing said rebutted matter?

Why wearing masks time? flu could kill someone. common cold could lethal virus still already caused almost 500000 deaths happened otherwise.

Absolute misleading. People dying virus. virus stray breeze tips balancing car edge cliff. idea always discussion regards flu never discussion COVID mind say threat people die selfish ridiculous.

I never claimed threat. way selfish advocate people take care they're risk, selfish force people shut businesses wear face masks vastly small minority critically effected this. services assist need? Absolutely. stay home work sick? Absolutely. wear mask public regularly interact risk individuals? Absolutely. way state take action individuals mandate face wear force work guise ""you want grandma seem know herd immunity means. Herd immunity last resort methods fail, cases growing high slow conventional methods.

It's actually one first things vaccine arrives specific part populous effects. Chicken pox parties common example herd immunity. infects populous low risk control protect risk. cases still skyrocketing. 

That's kind 'no shit' situation. Tests readily available, people interacting states opening up. really mean much aside people get antibodies stop spread (there's little evidence reinfection rate virus among healthy telling people wear masks ""propaganda"", would need ulterior political motive involved getting people wear masks.

The idea getting people (more) comfortable state control healthcare (including distribution administering vaccinations), idea face recognition systems specific tests, reliance state intervention market. uk slowly trending upwards cases way. idea someone thinks 8,685,617 people ""couldn't get virus fucking tried"" shows elementary school level maturity intelligence deniers have.

New Jersey resident I'm SOOOOO glad Chris Christie governor right now. really three choices:

1. Face masks social distancing, 
2. Another lock down, cases come again,
3. Let huge numbers old people get sick die.

They want #1 #2.  implicitly choosing #3. 

Could plan get grandma social security medicare, sooner rather later? Masks highly recommended months people still aren’t wearing them. Masks required stores cashiers physically attacked asking customers wear them. reality you’re never going get portion country who’s made freedom (for reason) wear mask. You’re right, probably could go back somewhat normal life you’ll never get buy-in people make effective thought going article US tbh. badass BLM cops killing poc... Thank posting study.

I work hospital FL. Masks made mandatory staff around March. 

I comfortable donning masks &amp; PPE caring isolation patients, like Americans: wearing mask times felt strange &amp; uncomfortable. mention irritation behind ears &amp; awful “mask breakout”.. acne loves warm cloth rubbing chin 12+ hours. nurses crafty &amp; we’ve come sorts helpful accessories (like headbands hold mask without hurting ears!)

Today realized wearing mask feels completely natural now. wondering - took ~3 months get used wearing mask extended periods time. Within minutes longer feel face. 

Now, doesn’t change relief feel toss mask garbage bin way car long shift. 

So opposing masks - get it! ask please make small sacrifice minor discomfort go public.

I plan continue wearing masks public least December, perhaps later situation evolves. 

For saying wearing masks robs us essential human communication - you’re missing expressive power eyes! smile people everyday mask &amp; certainly tell smile back (or don’t cause they’re sour lol). Expression clearly visible eyes, little wrinkles faces make, lift eyebrows.

Masks aren’t going anywhere. took 3 months come terms that... y’all feeling masks?

You could sneeze shirt. thought coughing spread it.

Anyways I'm wearing one. you. anyone actually looked data article using? awfully incomplete data.

I'm saying make point go back normal even slightest - data looks bad.

Take look red states. Click around counties find made color choices. far tell Michigan places 80% ICU usage. red/critical states anywhere close that.

Additionally Michigan touted great contact tracing every single county Michigan big city ""insufficient data"" qualify contact tracing. Hmm....

This got removed mod political. hell statement political? Yeah also true, unless someone know begin except truth Last night alcoholic drink felt feverish right drinking 

I checked temp using IR gun normal 

This morning used oral thermometer 98.9F 99.1F.

I still feel feverish stressed past days regarding stuff

North Dakota first sorry NJ key NYC re-opening. many people come work NYC NJ, basically important handled fully re-open nyc Never said butt pirate. said bullshit double standards y'all have. Go Trump Nothing guaranteed ""safe"". Everything except sitting home immediate family unit incurs risk. question is: much risk willing incur hang friends etc? Yeah, issue go every bit human nature, see, even compliant countries, tough do.

I'll honest, given history humanity, know sustained measures need happen realistically possible amount time need measures Hundreds thousands people country thing multiple times week protest behalf Black Lives Matter one says word. Health Agencies local governments literally changed Covid guidelines say can’t social gathering 12 people, unless it’s protest. fuck virus know difference wedding, funeral, protest? It’s absurd. either virus isn’t deadly officials making be, don’t care lives people protesting. Like people protested lockdown absolutely vilified people sub, one dares say word BLM protests fear getting cancelled. It’s hypocrisy finest absolute joke. people work place seem think wearing mask relieves social distancing. 3 people 1m² common sight. virus deaths inevitable point.

Could prevented many deaths competent leadership beginning? Absolutely! 

But we're at. Can't go back things right, we're shittiest timeline.

I choose anything. virus chooses.

Do think could get though 0 deaths? not, choose \**however many deaths think ""good"" number deaths*\* people die? travel starts thrown window. Oooohhh see. Thanks! positive need stay home.  someone tell shouldn’t issues summer heat kill it... tried explain disproven, didn’t want hear it. Seriously tho tourists arriving droves... I'm leery future way counter continue keep contact tracers vaccine out. continue track infection rates, see uptick, immediately swarm area tracers find root cause. identify people could infected, impose quarantines them.

That's basically every state/country deal things borders entities, especially things open up. everyone luxury small island like Taiwan NZ Oh turntables. check ""dumbfucks protests"" sub; enjoy there. one ""living free die"" seems include freedom protest. bundle contradictions kinda like said, areas. certainly going stats, experiences living 6 different cities across Florida fevers? not, temperature check door caught them.

Assuming there's one advance staffer every attendee (so 1000 staffers 20000 attendees, though I'm guessing numbers), prevalence coronavirus rally-goers 120 people arena, spreading virus, probably wearing mask around others probably wearing masks. NBA setting shop Disney World next month. 

Disney World re-opening mid-July.

It's going massive shit-show. Ya true, definitely many factors keep ppl alive great! shame built society ppl needing money live going forward population grows poverty. traffic, traffic smoking!

and drinking driving!

People might right risk lives risks health life others. puts week ahead doubling rate 14 days? seeing much younger people coming hospital, many 20s 30s, many cases chronic conditions co-mobordities.

Okay good news all. thinking taking kid shopping today (getting beyond stir crazy) plan nixed. Unfortunately factor summer spread body conditions warmer months factoring well. weather temperatures sweat lot sign run higher body temperature naturally would, hence sweat. deadly condition viruses prevail. Goes viruses adapt high temperatures. Infected people therefore benefit naturally fight positive infections shrug of. conditions levels temperature virus die less natural advantages place anymore infected people see stronger impacts virus again. I'm Russia. good number people never gave shit begin with! Well northern Michigan, big issue. Tourism big deal frankly numbers hilariously low compared city. one sparsely populated parts country. appeals weak ideas semi literate.

Here's three dots, fill whatever want I'm saying mean... tf lives northern Michigan Stay fuck lane Summer, Arizona. come Cali summer please, infest. you’re saying data exaggerated officials better job counting time..? new developments origin virus?

Some kind animal population likely- reading papers coming China probable source population Malaysian pangolin. going take decade, vaccine next year. Anyway, going date one person much safer going crowded bar/club. terrible antibody tests PCR test? ling take get results? Read last paragraph feel much better. spoke brother recently stated ""I'm afraid virus, people get asymptomatic. let stop living life.""

Not true. estimate 45% people asymptomatic. 

source: tributes replace confederate trash with. Oh ffs. Stop talking like I’m goddamn toddler. else “strong people” do, da-da? eat vegetables?

If he’s suggesting “strong people” wear mask “sign compassion, that’s bunch nonsense. saw alcoholic hobo Walmart buying 40 mask on. It’s called “common sense.” we’re it, put “hero” nonsense bed? No, Walmart greeter hero. 18 year old McDonald’s frying fries hero. They’re normal people work wish unemployment. Flabama first full week June saw almost twice week prior. positive average time death I've seen 12-17 days. going know answer disagreement soon. interested see death surge happens states reading lately rising case numbers. cry “why grandma!!!!” stupid realize reason she’s dead. think fired based know story, always two sides, side describe something objectively immoral. Today's record Brazil happened backlog data, issue last two days São Paulo state ""e-SUS"" system could update number serious ICU cases caused underreporting. Today corrected 19k overall cases last three days entering system.

Source portuguese: Germany seen 3 straight days 500 cases 18 days below. man. reports coming accurate. understanding 80% ICU capacity totally normal. covid patients hospitals converted step PACU floors. days released. treat covid patients literally every day. Ventilators used point patients die, RTs physicians would handle that,not me. work 3 hospitals Tampa Bay, probably pretty similar scenario major city major covid+ cases. hoax, fear mongering, that's get state, get labeled “recovered” 14 days symptoms start long aren’t dead hospital. Probably, overwhelmed ICU’s sooner. read today Houston hospitals already started sending ambulances hospitals room, predicting full ICUs two weeks. Somehow surged 1,000 new cases today it’s normally around 400 day. hope they’re setting extra beds maybe new (temporary) hospital locations they’re ready people need it. That's good point. optional US. Seems like Trump crowd likely opt out. Lack empirical evidence cloth masks work. told leave n95 surgical health care people. pointless bars restaurants. Everyone touching faces. stand back cough me. agree this. One I've lived multiple countries. Oh god, even get started nose thing... Like seriously what's fucking point? part ""respiratory transmission"" understand? know nose part respiratory system, right? Jesus fuck. Ban airlines. Let ass take bus. Woah, looks like know who's winning Nobel medicine year. No, could invest potential vaccine companies! Common sense packed bags took plane going *anywhere * conservative family members wear masks public consider respectful. ..or churches, meat processing plants.., prisons, navy ships.

I'm sure missed something, unlike covid... favorite one chick understand pull every time u need talk. I’m idea forcing someone wear mask (from law based/governmental standpoint) agree airliner this. Private establishment wants Floridabama* trust FOX News? good talk someone outside US. I'm Alabama (Trump Country). hospitals flooded Covid19 patients doctors slammed. go grocery store half people wearing masks. People like science dude. I'm glad y'all farring well there. wish kind thing worst enemy awful. family constantly living fear. Looks like cure hot water along! it, guys!

Good day sir. like people public relations know Edward Bernays world living in? wait days/weeks, BLM protest gonna cost thousands lives. agree it’s shame see medical professionals deny covid-19 work certain job doesn’t mean you’re actually skilled fit it. asked bunch questions experience treating patients won’t hold breath answers.

Not. many us think useless possibly making situation worse. bother unless like lick bowl done eating. Yeah, is. simplest thing kill around you, refuse. missed. That’s close describe mine. Words come in, get jumbled around point roughly 180 degrees be, hear jumbled mess respond that. 

Sooo much fun, isn’t it?! But, hoax! /s immediately scrolled thread batshit comments. dissapointed. right... actually, 0.1% population.

Not I'm cheering anything. far ""under control."" Please grow up. see exact opposite. We’ve steady decreasing numbers two months. We’re 150 ICU patients 4K. We’re averaging 1500 recoveries day. 

One hot spot breaks doomers practically salivating mouth. 

We 250 new cases entire country yesterday. that’s supposed “bad” think lost us Italians gladly take it. trying get people follow lagging indicator obfuscate. happening threads. Hammering misinformation. sure goal is, foreign domestic. 2020 keeps finding new ways weird. Isn’t easier conservative (irony aside) side assume people wear masks, case it’s worse everyone authority says? Isn’t risk/reward substantial? They'll get medications deal symptoms complications brought virus (anticoagulants, bronchodilators, antibiotics, pain killers, etc). They'll take medications manage fevers, get tests blood work, hopefully keep touch doctors they've recovered fully. I'm surprised friend needed request paperwork diagnosed virus. enough (did need documentation clear return work?) got it... Sadly one conic piece lead Pence, one Pelosi even scarier IV years .45... :-P people pretty plugged Clemson. 23, 20 currently asymptomatic. dumb reponse mess? boggles mind. Really. hard breath work them, that's problem.

I wearing mask since day 1 awful.

Police fine people wearing masks America imo like Europe. countries becoming problematic though. Thats still leaves nearly 100k cases coming countries. Looong way go sure. might late. oldest son spectrum 3 kids sensory processing disorder. Could post picture pattern style mask? would helpful us! decide gets live die, based comfort?

lol - virus broken people's minds. Florida's gene pool achieved herd immunity. love one enforcing succeed. walked 7/11 today california (orange County) even workers wearing masks. state mandate yesterday? get labeled “recovered” test negative. takes however long takes body get physically “well.” Many people facing months healing, permanent disabilities. reason isn’t getting much press coverage. disgusting is, admit kinda genius part. They've managed convince significant chunk population laws regulations meant protect (mostly corporate evilness general fuckery) actually *oppressing them*. 

They've convinced people keep voting Leopards Eating Peoples' Faces Party because, goddamn it, 'Merica 'Merica God-given right face eaten whoever choose!

(Of course, faces inevitably get eaten, somehow blamed Leopards Eat Peoples' Faces Party anyway. super convenient.) Use hand sanitizer touching eyes nose mouth beside using mask course. Soap water best killing mtf pathogen Western Australia, Australia.

1 new case last week, tests available anyone slightest symptom. Good response early on, sorry friends US :( really businesses employees sit tight indoors 8 hours whereas protests outdoors, spaced out, last longer couple hours smaller towns. 

I work security casino tell right business prepared shit. ... healing crystals, Star Wars maps, left-handed scissors ... mention measures taken try slow covid Decent people. Caring people. Careful people. Pragmatic people. Sensible people. Even selfish people. entitled assholes refuse wear mask might save others. 

It takes nearly effort experts wrong aren’t put out. Yeah, us liberals suck slogans. One coworkers friend got COVID ventilator two weeks still survived. refused wear mask prior getting sick. stats see 80% put ventilators coronavirus survive. 

They use ventilators surgeries though - stepfather ventilator triple bypass surgery. recovered fine ventilator less 8 hours. Entirely different put you’re sick. Well, *some* people think ;) problem it’s hard know there’s uptick disease A) people aren’t getting tested B) people aren’t getting needing hospitalization. average percentage people asymptotic it’s hard know superspreader events unless people start dropping like flies, won’t considering 1.2% death rate.  voted week wouldn’t seen many tourists wearing masks. one allow inside without one. visit, can't hug even touch 70+ year old parents. It'll another 10 feet apart visit wearing masks like mother's day. Maricopa Pima Counties mask mandates. Also Yuma Payson. 

Yavapai County Trump land obviously said masks. don’t know don’t freak out. woke still vented surgery even though knew happening nurse holding explaining (pseudocholinesterase deficiency), still ripped abdominal stitches struggling. feels like someone strangling you, brain doesn’t register oxygen lungs, can’t get air in. say wear face mask stop thinking it. We’ll able see Tulsa ICUs, show us spread community large. 

Why dense, clearly case study lots data available free testing sites closing midday capacity, I’ve heard private test sites charge you/use insurance still going. free test sites haven’t bad since first started March, tests problem everywhere. embarrassing yes Thailand allowing Chinese nationals visit tourists (among “safe” countries) Americans....that’s good sign reputation world RN. It'll best covid ever contracted toy want cooper? Remember purple/red state, moves need appease sides extent. fucking protests?! Brazil getting destroyed 54k confirmed cases yesterday, America back 30k first time month half, long way go folks people claiming hospitals artificially inflate number COVID deaths get Medicare payments, thought nonsense. hospital lie financial reasons, would make sense present less COVID numbers. Hospitals bleeding cash pandemic due shutdown reducing elective surgeries. That's big profit maker. would best financial interest say COVID, go reopen 

Also shutdown, people would employed covered private insurance, pays lot Medicare/Medicaid. Daw thanks! didn’t even know now(: 

Same though, that’s hilarious favorite report Indian nuclear incident one almost 30 years ago. ""July 1991 contracted labourer mistakenly paints walls RAPS heavy water applying coat whitewash. also washed paintbrush, face hands deuterated tritiated water, traced since."" RAPS is, incidentally, far Kota. Thanks parts country take seriously enough. civil war coming, political divides already time highs states took radically different approaches handling virus. NoBody COUld SeEN ComING!?!?!?!??!!!! ""*We* this, *other* people!"" Oh gosh! guy whose saying religion bans type face covering?! imagine smug look face. total... don’t word want say Boy wrong. Head CDC's website compare cause mortality Florida state like Michigan. Covid year comparable 2017 flu thus far, state miles go gets close Michigan New York:

 Thats definitely working way. Lmao love “fuck” isn’t whacked automod word laughed ass ""students trump"" billboard calling governor whitmers recall everyday drove past it. commute mid Michigan Troy every weekday arrogance ignorance represents killed me. folks know whats good them. thankful response willingness fellow michiganders what's right. Folks argue fucking morons. Fun Klandemic!

Mother hangovers coming weeks though... preview what's come. next two 28 days, more, days Tulsa going interesting. Well goes ways, obviously less virulent one go away, one mutates virulent strain continue spread mutate again. Depending protests are.. actually bad people think. Plenty protests daily NYC weeks Spike Corona Nope. wailing gnashing teeth. brains equipped deal things like Scary stuff. right. could effect even states, right? That's exponential growth works especially people asymptomatic spreading studies done HCQ (and lot) deemed useful Covid. Better survive poor die trying make money.

Get ready round two Spain. Love username There's name system government. good one. say responsible Pandemic.  0.0000758% US population current active case. Good thing I’m planning spending time Arizona Kansas road trip. not, temperature check door caught them.

I doubt temperature check door going stop *anyone* going in. imagine campaign staffer telling enraged redhat whose waiting day Tulsa heat they're allowed inside? still idiots though.

I’ll honest, today one idiots couple minutes. Walked craft store mask fanny pack didn’t realize like 5 minutes. I’m usually diligent it, too. Like get MAD see people without them. suck haha see difference rally protestors/rioters. double standard media disgusting. hit time high 30000 new infected day yesterday protestors. Yes would bad, literally earth done square one us knowing virus here, tests, contact tracing, wearing masks, living life's like everything perfectly fine America could never get this.

Square One death rate doubling every three days, shown China, Italy, France NYC. virus isnt widespread enough matter Indeed, meant ""Rally,"" completely ignoring Fauchi/Birx said near start... New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine Meanwhile good ole Merica priced $5230 per tablet... Hi, northern Michigander here! We're actually utterly doomed fail!

The locals fine. nothing done stop tourists flooding in. Like seriously, number license plates Texas, Georgia, Arizona, Florida, California even.. utterly insane. Every day hundreds new tourists states descend us, they're coming over. We're serious danger outbreak.

Traverse city's cases consistently rising ever before. Bars full social distancing, malls open one taking seriously. restaurants waits, hotels full every day. see weddings large parties going forward mask use, distancing packed brim.

We're royally fucked. shutdown stopped tourists coming area completely contained before. guarantee America SURGE WAY PAST 30K PER DAY average month that, first wave reaching peak America, Brazil, India raging uncontrolled. , second wave begin roll back across everywhere contained it, the. also normal flu season. 

I don’t know another then, whatever horrific. Stay safe there. take word that? Yeah stepping lead, proud Florida. Judging general attitude reddit, miracle spread disease, reddit gonna fucking *seethe*, half users *want* people die. Yes. protesters, mostly wearing face coverings masks outdoors , Fox News cover story spread covid result rally. thousands idiots packed enclosed arena thousands idiots best advice every public health official America world wide, none wearing masks. NOTHING spreading virus. philosophers call moralistic fallacy:

""It horrible contemplate hundreds thousands deaths inevitable, therefore hundreds thousands deaths inevitable."" What's point making June 2021? idea virus situation then. I'm masks, make 2 month renewable mandate? mods seem hell-bent preventing p olitical discussions beyond leaders force subject actions, talk policy. Funny states already first wave seeing massive infections states seeing first wave? sEe! lOcKdOwN nEEdeD!

mUh rIgHts gOt tRaMpLeD!

/s every idiot knew college majored poli-sci scientist?

Please confirm. true, plenty people testing protests even feel well. Tests picking positives hospitals procedures, testing work etc people symptoms. Well, that’s thing makes sense Maybe people drafted waivers lol sure hope not. want someday set record oldest inmate federal prison system. Pandemics suck. think number high, second crossed ocean unfortunately inevitable way past it. pick pace it--and slower go greater economic carnage--but can't choose go it. Makes sense though. everyone wears masks, reduces virus spread significantly thus reducing economic impact well federal funding needed. /s subtract protesters w/o masks? part reopening plan. big surge get people get sense demand leaders something.

Never mind. Yes! recent map showed states decreases states increases looked lot different this. Illinois actually largest drop new cases, yet listed risk here. Unfortunately even midst pandemic cops bring put moratorium murdering black people. article cites State government's website. seems good, already human trials going enter human trials soon? know anything else say without admission. actually even read wall text. I've trolling care push envelope anymore gotten boring.... Classic British. Anyway... Gr8 B8, M8. good one. Godspeed USA, friend. may alarming personally think Germany fine outbreak wont turn another massive cluster, thats testing &amp; tracing system. accept outbreaks occur n due mobility long tracing system place, outbreaks contained chain infection broken... I'm basically loss words point. Trumpism death cult people insane. Gonna whole lot rally. I’m genuinely curious studies replicated USA? big pharma attached drug political party something else? Oh, know kind moron appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* people treading /r/BirdsArentReal territory. think it’s trainable willing learn. Come toxic politics, stay toxic viruses! absolutely growing exponentially florida right now. 

12% positivity combined highest case count terrible news. protesters outside moving. peeps gonna butt inside hours (doors opened they’re cramming in) screaming lock whole time. believe situation order magnitude worse protests, though definitely fuel pandemic well. work service industry jobs thay require interaction public.  long term acute care. patients may need 24/7 assistance, adds $$$$. give patients positive COVID-19, that's revenue door. Judging numbers may passed communities died warmer weather happened. believe happened area. ton people sick around 7% community confirmed positive, others could get tested. didn’t much shutdown mask compliance low days. haven’t new cases awhile. younger people going back work restaurants bars bet mid August next year, probably even virus aa deadly disease anymore! decade absurd things right might even needed lockdown, least every part country. taken decisive action beginning, sealed airports earlier intense testing contact tracing early cases, progress city wide regional lockdowns needed, would much better. 

Roll coordinated national guideline safe operation daily activities, coordinate testing, PPE production, get correct info it’s important take steps. Could saved tens thousands lives much economic damage preventive measures taking. 

I course speak benefit hindsight, thing is, already hind sight back well. China, SK, Italy warning anyone ever needed. hamsters mean U.P.? calls northern michigan? Meaning theorize won’t something like smallpox eradicate it, may like influenza repeatedly vaccinate becomes new “norm” around so. ontarian thank Michigan New York meat shields rest states so? luckily MLB minor league players farm teams! They're going switch half roster want continue playing. hope player gets seriously ill hospitalized. guess air conditioning offices businesses. Case spikes hot places. Little air conditioning UK. Shhh! think Sun Tzu said something this. Travelers AZ Kansas must quarantine 14 days. Masks implemented counties. I'd say another 3 weeks reveal much realize reminders s/b like 6 weeks. *""As closed eyes, let gasp dying words, ""Thanks, Obama.""* apparently one came check someone 'intensive care' ward least half hour battery gave out... warning light/tone .... disaster...... god Proven  Tbf protests aren’t helping stop spread They’re still gonna hard time considering alot still believe fake. Modi Trump extreme opposite responses situation. They're comparable. 


India crowded there's much poverty. Hard stop spread ""home"" 20 sq ft hundreds people living area size Olympic swimming pool. denial science playing exactly COVID-19 intended. next three years starts fizzle own*... 

However, fully believe virus active world rest lives. feel luck running soon. pray Trump polling sees losing November unless get spread bullshit rallys. He’s probably right. talks controls narrative. try feel inevitable since full contact practice end July Coronavirus thank later... It’s wear mask drive through, solidarity. make together, working together. contact state pharmacy board. take failure exercise basic health guidelines lightly. I'd understand feel can't cousin, might saving lives customers...  CDC saying thing time, social media companies banning people expressing opinions COVID-19 contradicted health authorities. Fair enough original comment can't wait roar thru Villages.

Implying want cause sickness death prove point. stood +3 earlier.  imagine 19K ppl inside building, social distancing whatsoever... so? 

Are going older people? What’s wrong they’re encouraged governor go out, PPE isn’t necessary. mean live Portland, accounts amongst lowest aggregate infection levels major city nationally. say wrong, would interesting virus could long anyone took seriously yet yet exploded here. pretty much militaristic USA gobbles adores...the idea ""men women front lines"" ""risking people, keep country safe"".

It's abundantly clear mask message disconnected literally anything else. tell people are, velocity reduction probability modifiers. take information apply situation. Stay safe u/johnb205. far appears true. throw caution wind, least appears like widespread mask usage seems deciding factor. Geez! It’s like want people get infected. Amusement parks perfect place virus like spread. Close contact, people rides screaming top lungs. Droplets place. Apparently published journal? integrity come question. toilet plumes airplanes?.... That’s real question. 14 days. hefty fine violation.

That's irrelevant. time spent confined, densely populated plane recycled air problem. Thank much! I'm medmal attorney I've following incredibly closely. tedious times I've published articles firm disappointingly gain much traction, really appreciate comment. mean managed make climate change denial ""political"", surprising, still is. Reality denial politics. Wait doesn’t everyone this?!?! mask replacement effective public health policy.

Does look like America this? excited wearing mask co-worker whose wife diagnosed breast cancer recently. able kiss her, hug her, sleep bed 3 months. woke up. live small town affected badly others, I’ll damned expose friend something may cause wife exposed potentially deadly disease. learned it’s me, it’s everyone know love. ""its worse thought would be"".

I disagree. dumb ass see coming mile away, knew. 

The question allowing happen? Get informed, seriously. guys realize hard actual whistleblower. people get fired may find difficult find job industry. saying wear one. sticking would've agreed first place sticking what's easy? polls thought quite good least. Nate Silver likes polling weighs highly polling averages. knows young won’t vote anyway... [This seems making well anti-mask market. currently Covid ""truther"" ""book"" toward top Amazon best seller list. Conservative ideology ""it's immoral tell i'm wrong"". annoys left Tampa Bay Buccaneers. visit r/COVID19positive — many people, including young healthy immune systems, sick past *months*. virus affects entire body studies shows leave permanent damage. 

Being outdoors great idea. It’s great mental health *and* it’s also proven virus transmission much lower outdoors. Scientists encouraging people go outside since pandemic started.

I’m pro-lockdown I’m pro-“open economy like nothing’s wrong” either. Masks great way open things without gnarly consequences, unfortunately people still argue this. Things won’t completely safe scientists learn virus is, used treat it, vaccine safest. then, it’s common courtesy people wear mask. It’s literally *least* do. Man I’ve thought start. I’m super worried India. hope you’re right mate. need guys cricket rivalry too! Love Australia Orange County pretty much taken stance masks. Downtown LA, lot people wearing masks - even percentage homeless masks on. believe Inland Empire pulled mask order weeks ago LA county even started re-open. think logically would obligated re-evaluate data try get proper understanding. 

And hopefully would logical pragmatic without pressure impending doom looming us. Thank much. breathing takes awhile symptoms pop up? Covid really working hard. need give employee month something. uber troll mood tonight? posting unattributed fake tweet much possible. surely life gulags can't dull. ""most"" - dude lay conservative coolaid. obviously mismanaged LOT people. mirroring bogus talking point here. watched interview Doctor days ago made really interesting point Coronavirus struck society instead Spanish Flu - time technology death rate would surely include people hospitalized. ventilators, understanding viruses even existed. would make death rate 20% then. Young, healthy, contagious. least proposed cure isn’t deadly... think going go public don’t know something, shouldn’t make assumption. least say assumption don’t say anything say don’t know make comforting gesture end saying trying everything power find new intel asap. doesn’t mean can’t spreading. people go protest masses, people shunned going beach hanging bar? shouldn’t mass gatherings right now. Regardless cause. matter everyone “fine”? still family staff they’re interacting with. mention potential long term damage people no/mild symptoms experiencing. **COVID-19 particle:** infects man.

**Man:** oh, see, 'cause I'm black. like that. much different protests... Don’t forget world flat vaccines bogus well. F science!  Can’t fix stupid Another gem Facebook

You know internet outage? Check phone! settings, tracks covid19!!!

Yeah, phone never tracked before. Also, needed pandemic add tracking software. Also, made visible settings. tweet attribution source. lines. link official source, location purposefully omitted. like every time feel I've interacted dumbest troll internet, troll uses twitter source proves wrong. I'm expecting redact comment comment straight lie proved lie. Peace bro. I'm wearing mask social distancing lot lives lost hurt cause covid want careful Everybody clustered inside breathing other. fun realize registered voters. trust shared cultural narrative, they'll easily believe someone else tells - especially person looking around people/things blame something ails them. people pump racist baseless garbage first group people wants hear making money gaining influence process, feeds back endless nauseating loop.

I think they're sick fundamental level, terms see world themselves, we're seeing like inmates elected run asylum. There's lot fix hope come stronger it. senseless, irrecoverable loss human life drives crazy, though, know I'm far one. rising cases prerequisite reopenings... literally smart wear mask, stupid to. simple. Also accept horrific consequences allowing disease killed half million people ***during largest quarantine effort human history*** run rampant. Thankfully, plenty people quite short-sighted.   choice liberty works. Thats point no, fuck people took sound bite saying trying accomplish rode around like new trick pony. likely quarantined 12 days arrival anyway. say devil. 

He's liar. Clearly music style based profitable.

If makes people happy great, I'm happy people. 

 I'm pointing built fame lies amusing many people bought it. LOL. operate door knobs? special kind stupid. excerpt PDF site links. CA made masks required true May written.

When called moron ealier, insult, also statement fact. Herd immunity specialist Sweden pleased learn this... opinions current distancing measures super split, give hard time government officials pick right strategy, hopefully mandatory face mask place. point shutting basically 0 chance, even shutting bars extremely unlikely despite recent surge. DONALD TRUMP SMALL WIENER.

KING CHODES  Learn never again.


This are.. people peel onion Hence open dine google ""Remdesivir"", FDA approved proven effective drug Gilead, covid-19 reduce deaths around 70%. Hospitals using drug reduce lot deaths. 

But covid-19 still joke, still get permanent lung damage it. No. may closer true March, tests open anyone. People go get tested tickle throat, near someone confirmed, Tuesday want to. journalist understand ""mutiny"" means. surprised.  700 deaths obviously still horrific one pointing deaths dropping weeks weeks US. Obviously seen results south west wave cases yet worst trend going right direction now. problem it’s definitely getting better. protests. contrast EU US, current epicenter far less equipped fight it... Useless tits boar! Yeah show places put elephant signs elephants. could better social distancing. Could less people impacted whatever reason. think work make either. think failing exercise basic human compassion what's dehumanizing. Pointing suggesting could better person condescending, someone insists acting like child? TLDR: 4 imported confirmed cases, 23 domestic confirmed cases, 7 new asymptomatic carriers

Downward trend continues. can’t shoot common enemy, it’s real guess true, we're simply fucked, might well give prevention. get symptoms around 6 days people probably get tested later that. Around one month die average. dog fight, read this, point terrible irony:

You seem think author talking everyone disagree with, you, don'tcha? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm tried eating mask on? Pause mortgages property taxes. They'll tell numbers fake 99.8% people live.

Completely ignoring fact 0.2% US almost 700k they're willing let die *Looks NZ*

Me too! Logic gone window. better population people wear them.

We can't make determination. people sores faces becausethey wear often. present time, widespread use masks everywhere supported high-quality scientific evidence, potential benefits harms consider.

However, settings may possible keep physical distancing use mask could helpful provide barrier limit spread potentially infectious droplets someone infected. addition, evidence suggests infected people without showing symptoms may able transmit virus others.

For reason, advises governments encourage use non-medical fabric masks, act barrier prevent spread virus wearer others many cases COVID-19, people general public physical distancing least 1 metre possible – as, public transport, shops confined crowded environments.

It important note masks used part comprehensive strategy. Masks protect COVID-19. People also clean hands frequently maintain distance least 1 metre telling paper sucks 

No empirical evidence cloth masks suck ass clinical settings. empirical evidence possibly increase infection risks.

You empirical evidence support position. want wear fucking rag face. Go nuts. I'm not. Buy cloth masks wash use vastly prefer usually travel interaction within state city. hello guys seen fabiflu got manufacturing marketing approval india mean cure covid 19 Correct.

Only symptoms loss smell taste. Smell came back like 75% 2-3 months after.

Taste gone.  12 % positive rate FL tests real scary number. Exponential growth could eminent. No, don’t get it. don’t condone protesting either. don’t know anything me. know I’d rather take chances fighting injustice outside mask supporting inside without one. Go hangout twitter something. adults trying talk news massive block parties LA Latino/ AA. Florida already concerts pay attention can't reply frustration, daughter autistic. likes blender analogy. frustrations many sides (including hers), among family, communication difficulties difficulty saying what's head. even get job said communication disorder interviews, communication problems interfered verbal flow interviews. entire criminal justice system extremely violent especially ""blue collar crime.""

Prison systems home fight clubs organized guards, use rape punishment, there's free access sanitation.

And yet blue collar crime safest type crime imaginable.

A petty crook might steal car radio. employer steals pensions.

A murderer might poison victim. Corporations poison entire towns water supplies. getting excess deaths? i’d interesting seeing numbers live Florida. Desantis stupid. He’s willing trade lives dollars votes. 

Hardly anyone Florida discipline community -oriented mind-set endure acting consideration towards complete strangers years develop vaccine. Desantis knows that. That's pretty much we're doing. want know progression disease, long term effects, whether Japanese epiodemiological back March hypothesized multiple strains antibody dependency response correct (I seen anything clearly refute yet explains areas get hit hard seem spared). never understood awful Hospital system United States started working hospital. It’s profit greedy awful businesses corporations. basically told sales agent line work. doesn’t surprise something like occurring. Serious changes need made healthcare system. pub too, social distancing still required.

Damn stupid ask me. Indoors, people? Keep mask except take drink. don’t know needs hear this, new cases trend lower age, it’s important ever rigorously track “recovered” cases 50 states. would give Americans confidence reengaging society economy. ...man post removed cannot verify reliable source.

There’s 200 new cases day entirety Michigan, Greater Lansing 790 total cases entirety COVID pandemic. store requires wear mask I’ll respect that, Uber requires wear mask I’ll respect that. data Michigan says otherwise it’s over-precaution. That’s fine, decide take extra measures that’s great - won’t make fun you. people also need respect choosing return normalcy given current statistics / probability contracting COVID Michigan. reports new cases slow much weekends days; reported hospitalizations deaths really see weekend slow downs. said that, daily public reports show data mostly day prior, majority today's numbers really Friday. reports come tomorrow Monday contain Saturday's Sunday's numbers. FL resident - problem I'm seeing public irresponsible individuals.

I get businesses open, economy based regular repeated exchange currency. individual citizens behave responsibly though, cases going balloon.

That’s scam. wanting depopulate control us course mentally especially people like think it’s real makes people believe too. truth there. look Dr Shiva Dr Buttar name few. CNN MSNBC resources. Please people wake up! mixed black American tired nonsense happening country years. shouldn’t. immune system thing causing serious symptoms remdesivir convalescent plasma wouldn’t impact people seriously ill. Blood test see coronavirus antibodies, meaning previously recovered. know, something used community. see media Spain using it, nonsense like nosotres, Latin America/US media.

I noticed public health director Los Angeles saying Latinx weeks actual Spanish users must talked started saying Latinos, Latinx. thought, yep actually two separate populations.  went grocery store downtown Orlando - almost everyone wearing mask. required county starting tomorrow. Conspiracy theories secret deaths prove right shouldn’t allowed here. It’s scientific. Maine one big hospital that’s kind it. I’m guessing lack ICU beds per capita what’s hurting color.

On hand Michigan crazy number big hospitals number people live Michigan. Awesome 🥴🥴 go then, thanks! agree people dying can’t get procedures done. story, however, anecdotal. lot work corporate healthcare system. haven’t stopped potentially life-saving procedures, elective procedures. reason canceled elective procedures increases potential exposure. That’s anecdote. course entire point save many lives possible prove forgoing procedures costs lives Covid, argument doesn’t make sense me.

Thanks :) Well, coworker idiot, prophylactic studies well. Watched good round table discussion heads hospital yesterday. resident care cases hospitalization counts. said beds readily available median age cases 30 year old age group. 

Obviously high case count concerning however referenced new cases don’t require hospitalization they’ve isolated long term care facilities. We’re continuing reopen (because can’t afford stay closed). know narrative showcased certain way media sub. 

I know it’s early (and hole wait 2 weeks thing) Florida manage cases, high death rate hospitalizations lower age group could model manage moving forward. friend mine pulmonologist said new ways caring treating cases better they’ve learned. We’ve 3k deaths compare early hotspots like NYC. I’m hopeful new measures help numbers increase.

Myself, stay home much possible wear mask public. Yes I’m concerned hearing health officials make feel better. 

PS. think bars open that’s me. don’t go anyway. NHS UK British equivalent HSE Ireland. Thats strict lockdown people cannot exit house unless go work week grocery shopping. HCQ working?

Thank you. Still, could simply issue increased testing capturing people less-severe cases therefore young people. far, far conclusive. fact, second link suggest think likely before,"" said Dr. George Morris CentraCare. ""Now, identifying it

The first two links someone (Abbott liar) saying without giving actual data evidence. 

I appreciate responding links though, third one interesting. Anti body test Dumb shit. link contradict negate claimed, evidence, hard scientific evidence, wearing masks protective coronavirus prevent it’s spread public. yet show scientific study shows otherwise feel worth risk. Personally, I'm planning vacation, though somewhere touristy. wear mask whenever I'm around people but, I'm going literally hide inside apartment entire year given level risk covid represents health. Urgent cares getting crushed. customers closed doors due lack patients. flew Virginia Florida. got tickets months ago planning trip year so. weren’t going cancel. 

The Allegiant flight completely full, middle seats occupied. Masks required. gross. spotty. town university town non-student population 100k. health dept serious contact tracing. get numbers new cases published M-F many cases travel, household community. 

Once college kids, 25k so, come back August it'll interesting see maintain tracing .  ah maybe austere shutdown maybe people abided more? thought CA. stick state wide guess. I'm sorry wat? That's said. Look post weekly numbers every Saturday (431 AZ 5 weeks ago) consider many counties (WA) reopening. 

This isn’t contest, everyone knows first acted smarter we’re at. Right however we’re acting dumb show weeks. Lol, dumbest fucking shit I've heard. Let's see NY keep lowering daily cases shit starts opening back up. Japan WAY OPEN NY right now. percentages totally ignore fact Japan one-tenth number daily cases NY almost 7x population size. Japan averaging like 50 new cases per day population 130 million, NY averaging 550 cases per day population 20 million. might never vaccine that’s vaccines work: help body produce antibodies. incredibly true, several elite athletes knew university years 360 terms health year finishing university, diet stayed stopped intense exercise, quickly went muscular over-fat shape.  serology mean? haven’t heard back mine TX.... Hope New York bans tourists Florida like us get Body contact time. Can't keep distance players like baseball. Baseball easiest shutting stuff already. fell pretty good staying new evidence immunity couple months long. always fear since coronavirus. 

Why Sweden many states US persisting strategy knowing short term immunity strong possibility extremely puzzling horrifying many people unnecessarily die permanently disabled sort way. Tic tok Canada. Hope right. symptoms line mean thing. well could COVID-19 them, could something else. I'd say given timeframe much likely COVID-19 whatever specific disease got, since symptoms line quite well correct. Florida’s budget raised via sales tax real estate tax. Obviously sales tax receipts way event large scale shutdown. scientist published third epidemiological paper last week, sir delusional lost sight going NC +1549 cases today. testing flat. True, vaccine US help India's 1.353 billion population, Africa's 1.216 billion population South America's 422.5 million population. 

Would love seeing vaccine fall, comes logistics, making enough definitely going challenge. favorite winery ship, I'm going able get wine refill year.

Hopefully next year, we'll able get way. Reading comments, think demonstrate point well. Masks mandatory New Jersey since late March/early April. combined measures virus control one lowest rates spread country. states haven’t followed lead absolutely beyond me. Good luck. I’m sure massive problems known, obvious achievable/realistic solution.

Homelessness housing easiest things world solve. know solve them. know much would cost.

You may familiar politicians are.

They simply Rather shrugging saying US doesn’t care people, isn’t possible really complex issues tough solve balancing issues? Defaulting “the US doesn’t care” feels really simplistic.

The US *doesn't* care people. US lives hyper violent country deny poor people right health care, dental care, adequate education, etc.

This pretty clear established pattern. begin contact tracing next week believe move 4th phase potentially, might find interesting things there...

I think lack interesting things people craving sports. Can't really visit person. lot regional parks closed travel strictly advised against. festivals gatherings. Can't play sports yourself. watch television there's going massive content drought coming film TV industries ground halt. play video games many new releases delayed due COVID-19. 

I think will/should sports current climate either, there's absolutely need prat it. last thing I'm going right sneer people missing sports. check phone settings/google.

we (in Michigan) forced install yesterday contact tracing Live/die, kill/don't kill binary get. Weak people wear masks. Strong people do. Ditto. north weekend one wearing mask anywhere. Nobody respecting cautionary measures. LA mandatory way compliant whiter OC, say information needs actual data back up.

I understand people feel like we’ve trolled worst possible actions middle pandemic. 

Do remember saying anything dangerous virus would get jumped lots random people “doomer”. cure can’t worse disease, it’s flu, minuscule chance dying nonsense flooded board 6 8 weeks ago? 

Now country opened many states path exponential viral growth impossible stop, accounts gone silent. accounts saying bring semi automatic gun rifles protests. 

After watching go Reddit I’m pretty convinced countries pushing western countries worst stupid response possible pandemic large segment population gullible enough follow them! sad see. poor people taking right precautions makes sad. I'm going wishing best them, satisfying would see Trump proven wrong, want see anyone get deathly ill sick make happen fap vape what? live south. I'm sure they'll find way pin scientists. Hillary. link anything points increased testing cause?  Cuomo already considered it. Brazilians wearing masks? remember 1,000 daily cases 1/5000 people even everyone contagious ten days, active cases would 1/500 chances everyone contact daily basic, minus whatever protection measures use Good call, Sheriff. Unless they’re specifically looking almost 100% Latino demographic skew bad choice, Laredo one least diverse cities country online troll herd said Sweden fine it’s mean ban them? back Trump calling Democratic hoax? No? aren’t going contain covid. killing fewer people two months ago. 

And killed people state mile. leadership trash. government denial refused act. Funny people forget quickly. 

NYC fucked hack temperature screening? Could someone conceal fever applying small bag ice forehead prior temperature check? (--asking friend) found strange called three types corporations simply state income tax whatsoever. understand point trying make calling specific three. Thank god good news! 30-40 degrees india since March tons cases. even know people would think summer thing even theory Northern Michigan naturally socially distanced. go year camping trip (from Cleveland). cancelled year though worth risk. ""Sheriff"" needs de-funded seek employment beach comber siberia I'm Orlando, know two teenagers tested positive entire families starting show symptoms. definitely see numbers increase around next couple weeks. Hopefully, testing contact tracing we'll able get things back track weeks. going many new normals rose this. h1n1 china, became extremely common place see half pop sport masks public. think western world well. People's behavior already changed massive level this. notice watch old movie almost cringe see large crowds unnecessary touching... yeah world going different forever this. 

I also live country, views slightly clouded trees surround property... cities may need harsher measures still keep hospitalizations manageable saw around 4 officers outside vehicles yesterday around Santa Ana area. face masks.. 

Yeah ain't gonna enforcing shiet! NY, least live, there's ""I saw people without masks supermarket."" wear mask want anything. That's it. Personal Responsibility (tm) One 90 centers selected across country county disturbed way society marginalizing elders community. God’s plan work? dumb move state. Arizona vying top spot too. battle bullshit (leaders) Mine presents little atypically. came probably 3-4 years. Symptoms increasing fatigue/sleepiness day, circadian rhythm disruption, sleep paralysis night time hallucinations. get much ""sleep attacks"" people fall asleep uncontrollably. definitely part life, reason struggled badly getting work time mornings despite massive effort, noticeable symptom. 

In 2 years diagnosis exhausted time. would fall asleep 4 5 times every morning could actually get awake despite emphasizing getting enough sleep. could sleep 10-14 hours every single day still absolutely exhausted. spent weekends that, sleeping almost entire day still waking feeling like effects heavy sedative. 

My symptoms narcolepsy closely correlate related disorder known idiopathic Hypersomnia, another sleep disorder overlap, that's starting get pretty technical. harvesting, vulnerable populations already hit. Bring on, Fate! Oklahoma OK anymore. South Korea stop virus follow rules wear mask 

Stay strong y'all Good see see finally coming around. 

I find ajectives tad impactless though. death rate x 10, hospital adnissions x 20 Norway Finland deserves bit called *not optimal*, don’t think?

If 250 people died due poorly maintained roads Norway 5000 Sweden...I think would called something else *not optimal* Yo NBA sure wanna proceed? Bunch Leprechauns need freedom... Time liberate Irish oppressors, Boys... 

Come ye Black Tans... Yanks IRA reinforcements brought tea dump Irish Sea. 

#Revolution 2; electric boogaloo Someone made buck this, follow money. misleading iOS too. Apple Google worked together mechanics still need download app uses API App Store Yeah, automatically trust data understand. 

The difference two numbers show bad Swedish reporting is. truly understand exponentially people infected, doesn’t matter rate hospitalization infected lower? 

Are aware ways open restrictions hope hospital system cope fallout?

How instead allowing tens thousands people get sick *novel* virus know little crossing fingers, instead dozens countries successfully done mandate lockdown stop spread open masks contact tracing?

America unique developed world simply strategy. ONE denying people need jobs economy blah blah blah. course makes sense increase hospital capacity. developing strategy stop spread rather allowing happen unfettered hope doesn’t mutate/overwhelm hospitals/kill someone care about? They’re republicans. expect anything failure leadership? no. golf far easiest sport pandemic still shut reason Good choice... listed above. normal ICU capacity lol. study done years mid 2000s. weekend (which important holiday Sweden) they'll probably offline weekend. states open 2 months? North Dakota? example? Look Sweden prime example... Yo petoskey local, thanks! system used thousands years Indian subcontinent. still primary system numbering even today countries. quietly done great job despite withering criticism deniers inside state nationwide (including biggest denier white house). Yes. She’s handling data. She’s scientist meaningful sense term.

It’s like calling someone majored political science scientist. forbidden 

That's rich, /r/Conservative mate. one's banning saying opposing things. care downvotes, well that's another story, means maybe platform you. live county that’s applied Phase 3 cases going faster ever, down. don’t meet metrics, push goalpost say you’re Phase 1.5. wish Inslee would take charge instead trying please everyone. weakness (like Govs obviously Trump) fucking us over. Downvote away, might make feel better, it’s changing facts. We’re REALLY bad spot, actions aren’t helping. online troll herd changed foreigners’ view negative way, residents... That's next week, right leading infections. 

Their governor going full February Trump. agree attempted  Yes no. Even state income tax, people lose jobs, tax revenue goes down. airlines business they're going sell seats can, unless they're regulated to. people traveling hotspots vacations ones going spread home communities. understand disappointing cancel vacations, can't really expect plane half empty benefit. He’s best part NC government moment. Source: me, 45 year old white anti-Trump, anti-GOP woman voter. Fuck rest them. forget higher case-fatality rate. That's key statistic hone can't handwaved away ""well that's part plan herd immunity"" rhetoric actually talking infection. China buy time.

We see, example, outbreaks came Europe states seeded Europe. 2nd parts right Brazil beats US, countries Americas... America #1!   Serious question. know organ damage permanent? virus around like 7 months. plenty diseases long term damage, still recover even takes years. falling again? said FLA would 20k deaths back March. better moderna trying re-code DNA least RNA Counterpoint: Florida’s population generally older New York’s retiree haven. Sure, studies effect vitamin D, way studies virus targeting older people.  3 weeks since protest. Went store yesterday roommates about. hoping negative test result would full proof way knowing can’t spread virus. Taxes evil it’s done right. Look countries Europe - insanely high taxes know get? Affordable higher education, healthcare, competent public transportation, workers rights, etc called them? They're still going making wine can't sell. Circumstances may changed. Ha yeah avoidance moves mitigation acceptance real quick revenue streams threatened well guess we'll testing denialist theory disease bad ""experts"" say is. Wait, seriously holding rally there? Jesus, disease killed believe it. Nah wont taken away unless mean lack movement business due bedridden hospital home virus god knows spend enough time living life were..... Contact tracing increased testing nothing see here. Cases issue. issue absurd measures governors Record high cases states ended lock downs? Nobody could predicted that. 

Bonus: Nobody knew difficult pandemic could be. liked facts numbers I'm sure referring anything specific.

Look, every state closed reopened different levels endemic frequency.

This explains majority anomalies we're seeing. idea good reason nothing seek advice wrong choice means someone die. Frats south wild. fact rush summer bizarre. OSU let anyone rush second semester first year. Good luck enforcement, especially Orange County... Conch Republic! love independent strange are. set problems, doubt. least people culture unique. Argh! frustrating there’s state federal guidance. need wear safety goggles going out? — Chicago read low-carb diets really good inflammation. athletes get recover easily prove healthy people locked down. faith based argument, fact. Trump office, tried negligent homicide federal government's response pandemic, federal state levels. wasn’t confused all. put hardly people ventilators now. turns increased pressure makes things worse. common info sub month ago. also work hospital; took week get used initially. feel naked without one, like leaving house without wearing pants. Keys, phone, watch, badge, mask, door. routine.

It took trialing different patterns found comfortable ones wearing outside work. coworker custom made pair tie like surgical masks around top head around neck (to save ears), metal nose-piece (to keep falling down), elastic bunching around chin (to prevent difficulty breathing flush face). love masks much. 

I agree regarding eyes; always greet people half-smile, find smiling more, smiling bigger convey smile eyes. turn makes feel happier. definitely tell others smiling well. Eyes ""windows soul"" reason - much conveyed.

I honestly understand people dislike wearing them. worry micro facial expressions/RBF, whether pesto teeth coffee breath, I'm saving money lip care, feel anonymous lessens anxiety public... really love wearing them. hope becomes new normal culture, well past fall. article linked using figure 116,000 Americans No. REPORTED weekly average deaths dropped. government manipulating numbers make disease look less dangerous is. Coincidentally, number non-COVID pneumonia deaths quadrupled period. COVID deaths reported something else. math. Covid-19 used control you. Like slave.

The look bigger lies get. Love Cooper, anything better Pat. “When 15 \[cases\], 15 within couple days going close zero, that’s pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said White House briefing Feb. 26. Yeah! government politician care wellbeing people. telling you, politicians God sent. Thank lord! guys🙄 went doctor requested booster January lost records. get sick sick recovered well 4 weeks could worse. young people landlines. 

I know 0 people 30 landline 1 EVER owned one, free internet, think ever plugged in. Arizona getting hammered bad, bunch dumb selfish ppl “leadership”. really sucks see someone lives Looking forward judging science fair... shocked, shocked say. number deaths doctored. Look rate death ""Pneumonia"" quadrupled. government lying you. US handling like North Korea. should.

They stored memory b cells later construction diseases.

I would sure hope theres antibodies forever. Persistance free floating antibodies long infection signals chronic infection (like HIV) lead autoimmune issues antibodies 100% selective.

Please read articles. basically parable highly devout man flood. First neighbor comes tries save him, says No, God save me. man comes canoeing past window tries help him, man says No, God save me. Finally, he's roof house water growing higher higher, helicopter descends drips rope ladder. says, No, God save me. Soon water gets high sweeps away. gets heaven, quite angry God, says ""I devout believer, left die flood"". God replies, ""Who think sent good Samaritans save you?"" literally half tests positive, elsewhere around 10-20%. earth getting information from? not. Cases always get higher Tuesday Saturday, drop massively Sunday Monday. cases Tuesday Saturday lower previous Tuesday Saturday.. live vaccines like measles, mumps rubella stimulate immune system general *might* lead milder case covid19 otherwise. Studies using different versions BCG Tuberculosis vaccine already underway several countries (USA, Australia, others) based theory. also read scientist trying get similar study going USA using polio, another live virus vaccine. lot different mathematical formulas one use correct skew sample. even overrepresentation old people, skilled statistician would able correct poll answers still used say something population. America biggest idiots fuckers leave fuck alone. I've mild success ""so care kill mom grandma? that's mask protects!"" many SEE bullshit us? us thumb. SO, TOLD THAT, SUDDEN, GOVERMENTS AROUND WORLD TRULY CARE WELL BEING? FUCK WRING PEOPLE WAKE FUCK UP! WAKE UP! tried hard read thru bs word salad. happening. 

Bottom line: NZ 1 positive case? Please eli5?

Bottomless line: NZ SECOND WAVE!!!!! 

PS. I'm ny f 15th wave 2 new cases. However, something right, no?

Wear fn mask? Exactly. even enforce it, you’ve got tons people outside bigger cities ignore it, can’t put everybody jail. It’s basically unenforceable. Bro I’m tryna stop spread none compassion bullshit Lol second wave ? finish first one ? Sorry burst bubble first wave, actually start improving staying indoors end first wave. Oooo dark. use that. think face masks, man. Ahh, never mind, seems [another explains due backlog cases.  12 monkeys, perhaps? india though culturally acceptable racist bigoted. caste system embedded religion...so makes battle bigotry much harder. probably think it’s unnecessary. Either virus lethal don’t believe think numbers fake. Idk No, sure fuck didn't. I'm drop bucket then. 407,300 Americans Nah. Weak sheep. perpetrating scam, exactly? benefitting?  fuckers us thumbs missed trick there...this done exports refrigerated/frozen produce globally least. Swedes model? thought care might real glitch error reporting.

BBC confirms article [Coronavirus: Brazil becomes second country hit one million health ministry also posted record number new cases past 24 hours - 54,000.

If anyone Brazil, could tell us number trusted, anything else know. cannot order lockdown expect work.

You address problems provide solutions people face. India spent time issuing proclamations. didnt give cash transfers. didnt arrange transportation stranded people. didnt provide closer alternatives dialysis/cancer etc treatments. 

They basically nothing except try manage image government use police brutal weapon enforcement lockdown. lockdown plan generating buy-in people...and tried manage numbers denying tests hiding deaths...still going Well know react.

Beautiful shot. could lie results though, think. Abbott’s Trump useful idiot like DeSantis. would definitely believe US Agree. Everything I’ve seen says shortens hospital stay effect mortality.  First increased testing. migrant farm workers. young people. taking responsibility whats right, Trumps’ useful idiot. they’re helpful preventing wearer infection

Which lie. Later, PPE catching up, they’re saying wear masks prevent wearer inadvertently spreading it

No, people make masks adequate prevent spread. don’t need PPE doesn’t explain excuse it. two concepts true

They certainly aren’t true. Triaging supplies require lying. appropriate thing would honest restricting medical grade PPE sales medical workers routing shipments needed professionals. really seeing lied

He said masks aren’t needed won’t help. That’s lie. reasons lying don’t change fact lied reasons also dishonest. First depite lie still run available supplies supplies already limited they’d rerouting shipments since January. don’t know lied wasn’t protect supplies still lying. 

They severely damaged credibility public health policy want call foul people don’t believe them. People shouldn’t believe them, they’re liars. People take advantage immense amount direct information available numerous creditable sources scientists professionals willing *honestly* curate information. tracing , etc found strain infected NY State came Italy China. personal belief traveled China first Italy came NY.

I believe multiple major traveling trends. One suggested China US major destinations Italy, East coast US easier faster approached Italy. 

Another one (for US general) direct travel, maybe direct travel China first affects West coast easier approached China (due distance, costlier direct travel China NY). course virus comes West coast, it'll also easier get East coast due domestic travel US. may less direct effect. ... fucking kidding me? understand Christian spreading word. Increasing cases irrelevant. Also need remember deaths going states worst done well reducing numbers. seeing 2000 deaths per day, lot northeast states including New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts even Michigan. Total deaths U.S. gone done basically due 4 states alone. 46 states remained similar situations starting get worse. better position all.

Two weeks, nope. take longer go back up, likely month definitely September. We’ve started pro sports UK return July. seems seriously well managed incredibly low risk. tracked GPS data Football players years stats show players average close contact players 39 seconds per 90 minute game... outdoors. pretty low risk. Oh testing everyone involved like 2 time’s week! 

Cricket actually going making bio-secure venues. Two cricket grounds hotels attached 250 members ground (players, broadcasters, ground staff etc) hotel rooms site days before, (5day games) game. one venue. 

F1 sport that’s little tricky obviously moves across world. Majority people invoked ironically live within hour they’re based Midlands (UK), crossing international borders complex. 99% people survive getting virus 70% US citizens become infected without mitigation result 2.3 million deaths. Many dead parents grandparents parents. want parents die. know long term complications young healthy people, like shingles affects people decades chickenpox child. herd immunity guaranteed let run rampant. little research bet could find people went rally. sign waivers. Everyone's going post pics Facebook whatever. build temporary hospital nearby. old sick, it’s ok. /s necessary? Nothing.

Because exact headline june far June 6, 2020 (GMT +0), United States reported 1987621 cumulative cases, 112075 cumulative deaths, 747018 cumulative recoveries, **34327 new cases, 694 new deaths,** 27505 new recoveries Coronavirus (COVID-19). Many people opinion never lock again. Even governors said this. It’s incredible me. Wuhan, Italy New York, people still can’t see writing wall. think different here, rational reason whatsoever. 

Florida, btw. I’m really starting hate people. Calling current situation strategy Florida “Surveillance” like calling prison rape first date. title 2 weeks ago 3 changed 6. Well, he’s ex free-base addict, he’s trying turn around, needs place stay couple months.

Bad Idea Jeans yeah..my vendor lives hotsopot rich ..he got passes made visited village three times car (700 km away) lockdown. ""Stories"" right word. sub anything reliabe source anything. Ontario going stay lockdown forever? can't fully eliminate virus like New Zealand, simply amount cross border trade. second wave Canada come fall. then? get eyes checked out.

Thats one line.

I believe wrong US COVID-19 deaths combat deaths wars combined, laughably wrong.

However, fact COVID-19 deaths World War sufficiently damning really many people fired scores people going jail. Either someone(s) royally fucked system government needs radical reorganization. amazing nonsense. count general ANCIENT OBSOLETE economic status great cup holder positive thing yoir economy havent paying attention thpisands books movies show average people know going beyond hyperreality presents... us know patato worth car pandemic need say see rise heart attacks onset recessions, think understating psychological impact global pandemic economic uncertainty locking down. Along fear going hospital, created perfect storm stress drove non-covid related heart attacks up.

This true without going source provided. 1 5 incidence heart problems include temporary arrhythmia, 400k people NYC debilitating heart conditions covid, would know. Also, last study neuropathy read showed 5% incidence stroke brain bleed 735 subjects. ~30 suffered stroke/brain bleed, 10 age 65 medical history. line what's seen viral infections.

Sadly, one stroke victims 16. awful disease I'm trying downplay.. Ill first correct anyone comparing flu, important accurate assessment situation. “Another seven asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, infected coronavirus show symptoms, also reported June 19 compared five day earlier. China count patients confirmed cases.”

So, China count asymptomatic cases?? Oh, kind like they’ve 4,600 deaths. Save breath stop obstructing natural selection way, know literally half US population comorbidity increases risk vovid death? 400 lb chainsmoker talking happens educate whole country thinking individual liberties rights general well public safety. massive educative failure Yeah, I've thinking ages hearing slow recovery times issues (such loss smell taste) felt even people mild cases indicate recovery nothing like influenza. reactivation like shingles post-polio syndrome. unique damage virus causes might lead us later needing clinics specialists set help people cope ongoing health issues disabilities caused illness.

Fuck that. right even ask question allowed what. Others authority self. People going people, tough titties? Also, wear mask justify anyone, fuck mentality bullshit question mark connotating ounce authority decide one do, being. that’s everyone people got stop outbreaks undeveloped countries spreading starting again?

ban travel countries. make quarantine immediately. takes two tango. individuals need *abide* quarantine. enough policing monitor someone 24/7.

we saw areas experiencing outbreak states enact mandatory mask rules re-opening, lets see weeks.

other places moving allow indoor gatherings though time  Maybe mix exercise. help feel better. 

I live western NY opening phase 4 soon. Looks like within next weeks. means restaurants/bars among businesses think schools well. niece graduated high school year I’m even going go dinner her. doesn’t seem safe, even though it’s outside. 20 people there.

Unless say f**k point stop testing players walk like toddler yes are, sir.....yes are.....


....


:( masks tough images made. example: tiger/lion teeth. get behind left-handed scissors. Echo Dots butt plugs wait. change policy? use data make decisions, gut, then? Overall, hospitals still losing money Covid patients. Ignoring profitable electives can't perform right now, paying ridiculously higher prices PPE that's meant one time disposable overtime pay.  relief funds make attempt distribute based need enough cover costs particularly factor uninsured patients. Oof, hm, yeah, Houston great. still get outside pup heat let much possible. Screens great soul. 


Is possible take room totally re-arrange it? Move furniture around, take stuff out, bring stuff in, etc? found creating new physical space quarantine surprisingly helpful. Especially since home tough memories associated it. I'm sure havent able get tested...

But back February, announced thing USA, mother got super sick assumed awful flu respiratory illness. ended going ER discharged ""we dont see anything x-ray flu tests negative, fine"" even though felt like suffocating dying.

It took month go away, neither us okay since.
I've never chronically short breath physical activity *in life* even though I've struggled autoimmune disorder years. pericardial catch pain 24/7, days sleep 20+ hrs, I'm constantly exhausted, always coughing, constantly taste cigarettes even though I'm smoker havent near anyone smokes years, get vertigo nowhere, get random intense bouts severe anxiety depression nowhere.

If end catching early year, would mean I've dealing long term effects 4 months now.
And holy shit suck. days I'm okay, days feel like I'm flight stairs away heart attack. There’s 60 million Americans age. 

That would nearly 250,000 deaths age group *alone*. treat rally protests - wear mask, go home, get tested.... people buy lottery ticket odds winning hundreds millions one risk life behavior odds dozen one contracting virus. Math y'all.  Perhaps require least face shields. People find comfortable masks. could even provide (they reusable easily cleaned). jury still put effective are, like said better nothing. Handing free masks have, option face shield (which included ticket price anyway) masks might trick. 


Side rant: still can't believe people actually wearing face masks US begin with. live Germany everyone wears masks inside businesses. required. addition, plexiglass barriers everywhere. really bad like everyone US says? Brazil US things common. Fine leadership sure. Yes.  kids die become permanently disabled due Covid-19, she'll blame liberal conspiracy. Unless you’re beach, typically don’t spend ton time outdoors summer Florida. go A/C house A/C car A/C destination. don’t see schools open without vaccine. take one spark cv19 run like wildfire students yep, true trump fashion, made every rally-goer sign waiver saying catch CV event, trump’s reelection committee isn’t liable. virus “hoax,” he‘s preparing legal backlash spreads event... he’s piece shit. Yea say want groupings 10 mixing other. happen. human nature follow tight restrictions.

Needs middle ground approach here. Opening flood gates stupid dangerous, restrictive quarantine measures long term destroy lives ultimately disregarded anyway. feels like we're heading good direction, though. wrong virus getting worse people trying beat summer heat using AC?  

This one stronger pieces evidence. 34% healthy donors never COVID-19 (no antibodies) cells could recognize SARS-CoV-2.

I think there's another study shows cross-reactive cells likely ""common cold"" coronavirus recently. can't find now. expertly crafted ruse. never even thought accuse Sharmin Anheiser-Busch. ACE2 functions reduce angII levels therefore causes vasodilation *decreased* blood pressure... Peak infection numbers, deaths. understand willingly ignore this, like ignore peaks deaths come weeks peaks infections. He’s heading Arizona rally church Tuesday. People spend minutes waiting line said restaurant bar masked, hours unmasked. 

That's reality situation.

Forcing wear masks minutes allowing unmasked hours accomplishes nothing. 

Enjoy bubble. space program pennies overall budget military essential Pakistan China. 
Corruption government taxing 3% population giving freebies subsidies win elections holding India back wasnt TSA would feel up? Good thing se strong anti monopoly laws prevent running competition town!

Oh wait lets see tonight rally many masks worn.  Well said. explain little. Even pandemic, official recommendations place. said anything concerned about. Quarantines travel restrictions called xenophobic. Masks useless.

Compare everyone's afraid loosening restrictions saying started sooner everyone wear mask.

I'm anti science least. vaccinated kids get flu shot every year. wish people especially scientists would realize scientists know everything make mistakes like rest us do. there’s one word describe point: cult LOL. imagined cooler confederate flag stickers NASCAR logos. Yeah, variation higher numbers day. Nah, like live. I'll probably still fuck internet though, because, yano, ain't nothing pixels strangers hers. Yet dumbass, still science support notion masks help public. suggestion encouragement based what...nothing. Jesus Christ one wearing mask picture store Germany yesterday. employees wearing masks.. Never mind compassion, little respect? Assume people dont wanna share spit. can’t compare numbers killed wars numbers died coronavirus:

His math outdated since calculating living days stolen based assumed early figure average death age 72, later turned 78-80, calculating based 80,000 deaths, needs increased, see better measures deadliness simply measuring amount people die I’m starting wear one more. finally able grow beard like 4 months happened. work steel industry I’ve always required wear half mask respirator. day one adult career drilled wear mask right don’t wear wrong don’t wear it. think reasoning something false sense security gasses welders work kill fairly quickly right situations. It’s half assed excuse store requires even asks mask I’ll wear one. try avoid groups people. everyone laughed said 150k Aug 1. “SuperSpreader Event”

 say monster truck rally announcer voice.... TX numbers going cities large protests cases age group participated protests. Maybe CDC lied efficacy face masks beginning would credibility Americans would believe them. liars. Hypcondriacs. Tons anecdotes ""from December"" worst ""tested negative twice antibody test negative wtf covid???"".

The sub modded really all. avoid now. BINGO! that's say another shut down. tax revenue government collapses. Maybe leaders trying save Social Security without actually verbalizing intent. Thanks condolences, I'm Houston 😢 Again, can't handle escalation, start replying question cunt.

As said comment chain, awesome day dude. lucky. Miami totally different place form north altogether due everyone Latin America moving there. Cubans super conservative seem dominate Miami. 

I wouldn’t look north/south mindset. It’s different dominance Spanish English, amount Latinos around world, many Miami high-rise buildings money laundering cocaine industry, weather, etc. Take medicine change citizenship “ total number infections jumped 585 245,268, according Health Ministry -- significantly daily rise 355 Wednesday 181 Tuesday. “

Pretty big jumps happened now, idiots would call mustard gas “hoax” refuse wear mask. needs air, needs air, clothes sweaty Plenty others hospitalized. give loved ones, loves ones could end dying it

The simple reality testing positive virus told putting risk shock would wearing mask. Rules rules. saying.

Point is, Arizona everything open one cares virus. insane.  I’m PA, near Philly. Everyone wears masks grocery store &amp; indoor public places. Everyone. someone isn’t wearing masks be, told leave employees customers. county green zone June 26th taken disease seriously &amp; right thing. don’t want disease spread. family vacation OBX &amp; hardly anyone wears mask grocery store, even though signs put mask enter store. worried coming knew NC experiencing spike Covid cases. husband thought rules would strict tourist areas. They’re not. mask rule isn’t enforceable majority people aren’t it. understand mentality people want freedom pass deadly disease others feel inconvenienced wearing piece cloth faces. used think people decent &amp; empathy toward others. don’t think anymore. live place empathy isn’t discouraged. Society dictates people behave. behavior often depends upon peer pressure around us. saying ‘When Rome, Romans do’ seems sum up. family wears masks OBX, get dirty looks locals &amp; tourists. aren’t &amp; look conspicuous. might think Covid. think people told mask protects people’s germs. might selfish survive &amp; would wear mask fear. Instead told protects others germs. someone isn’t feeling sick, think ‘why wear mask?’ disease spread without symptoms &amp; disconnect happens. People either don’t understand don’t believe. happens them, sadly never understand. hope stay healthy. Great response. Use R-word replying someone works special needs kiddos. Yay? Awesome, nice day erectile dysfunction?

Whuut? anti-mask crowd's ears perked up. Let suffer consequences. studies seem show 19x different...

Think that, inside inhale 19x recycled air another persons respired air would identical spaced situation outdoors.

If people crowding inside avoid summer heat, places going get hit hard.... flip flop places people crowding inside avoid cold... fair, lot plates might snowbirds haven’t gone back north year. Different dipshits like Well, talking thing, acknowledge second sentence.

Yes, abundantly clear certain sectors benefiting pandemic. New sites get clicks, Amazon booming. Et cetera.

The person responded said scam. Amazon perpetrating ""scam"". seems imply media, explain actions taken governments worldwide. Including press hating POTUS.

It's real. risk real. Whether think risk overhyped, people dying.

Wear fucking mask. low cost way protect person standing next you. stand lose right ""scam"" infinitely lower cost stands lose ignorance. disagree analysis. general, outdoor area fares better indoor. Amusement parks normal outdoors though. Everything touched constantly. Bathrooms unsanitary (covid spread flushed poop). Many situations throughout day elbow elbow. Combine lax efforts individuals protect anyone even themselves. 'laws' 'rules' existed could even categorized currently do, understander understands understanding. laws society laws produced people, thing 'is'. Sure interesting see AFL now! Hope one else returns positive test! Thanks info. hope right cases severe, enough :( I’ve never seen point campaign events incumbent politicians. election referendum job done date. go compromise public health listen bullshit canned campaign speech ultimately meaningless? Even like him, kind moron risks health commercial?  dc average one... internet Holy crap!

Like taste anything like taste strong things like nose clogged combat now? Supplementing bunch b12 vitamins day? You’re fooling think American populace willing shut again. weakest people ever been. WWII everyone made sacrifices win war. can’t even get people care enough wear damn mask public.

We lost battle long ago. I’m saying sit Michigan. New Zealand shut theirs. Businesses close there, though, Government’s request. u/Mighty_L_LORT current trajectory talking about? agree. kids taking precautions playing. 

Something tells 19 year old star athletes going using unprecedented free time quarantine dorms Take Florida! can’t wait Xinny Pooh call Europe virus. backed DeVos PAC money Tell cancer patient **Lymphoma** I'd punch (not you) face. ...I know post *sarcasm*. don’t think us say sure what’s going happen 6 months 9 months. we’re losing 1,000 day 6 months, need talk slowing down. we’re losing 5,000 day, go quarantine. don’t solution, absolutely nationalized strategy. weeks school ended started getting symptoms well mom sister started cough felt pressure chest fever went get text mines came back negative mom sisters came back positive everyone better still feel burning sensation chest every 2.2 million citizens down. 326 million go.

Lol. reputable source this?  true, nothing R0. It’s German work condition issue. Polish mines Silesia, massive outbreak especially compared Poland’s small numbers general. miners tested, isolated it’s work condition issue now, never really caused noticeable street transmission Silesia (just family transmission) mention elsewhere Poland. also true German outbreak. numbers among German population.

I’m saying don’t matter, I’m saying sensational use R0 media do, total disregard weather street / store transmission cities outbreaks production plants counter productive, can’t really stop outbreaks plants. try contain sure. really matters R0 general population.

And used way, R0 1.79 Germany, always rather good Covid19 situation (high numbers due high testing, low deaths) great one, R0 countries massive outbreaks have. mean Brazil Mexico may actually similar ones, probably even lower, massive amounts cases.

So use number fact people associate R0 hear time (but know works) counterproductive. Say people said Latin American countries totally ignore R0 say 1.67 read one article copied world wide rich Germany 1.79... 

This problem I’, addressing. R0 used general population. ALWAYS numbers (per million) cases tests per context. Damn wish had. I'm actually looking general news around europe, news asia regions would bonus. subreddit unfortunately shows 1 2 news among many U.S. drive picture seems really unsafe. seen people get lot, dump somewhere. contact often people agree something unanimously. think agree Desantis worst Governor. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Hopefully people attending even evening Tulsa use sanitizer, face masks complimentary shot bleach.
The people want social distance baffle me. I'm actually allowed encouraged wear mask???? Happy day. Friday memorial day weekend, took two weeks get results back. can't even imagine now. go what? said no, prevent spread, reduce spreading significant factor? Florida probably gets visitors too. people travel Georgia's behaving way we'll see numbers go too.

Right argument “it’s young people getting it”.  long Sudden Death Overtime. really well said. individual drive big reason USA billionaires massive corporations. sacrifice see community. “Let’s open coronavirus hoax!!” it! really? get entering? literally lottery upside, no...

Yeah gonna say believe leading causes death Yes lot auto industry workers traveling back forth Wuhan Detroit believe actions life reduce risk totally eliminate it? kidding?! talking dad earlier. Like 40% something point headline ""ICUs filling up"" mean running room COVID patients.

I guess matter perspective.

When see Covid hospitalizations going means statistically ICU needs also go up. beds near capacity whatever reason cause alarm. Many areas can't expand capacity way NY NJ staff beds.

So live area that's government population nothing mitigate spread can't see fear mongering. every area NY NJ going Italy. yet still people using ""The flu kills people every year!"" line US started using dexamethasone?  reduce chance infection 70% like 30%. prevents lot infections 300 million people scale. Agreed. saying since beginning. originally Chinese strain!  Lol. 4k day pocket. what's hard staying feet away people lmao r/nottheonion It’s working designed. Yeah sure testing capabilities identify asymptomatic mild cases unless reimpose lockdown icu rate also continue upward.. hypothesize want there’s evidence world even locked hospitals get hit real hard Check tomorrow see difference still probably comes time day websites troll data are.

But using Right Wing tactic citing numbers without reason basis so.

I live Michigan. state third population Texas.

When amount active cases now, filled crippled largest hospitals State nearly month, point bodies stacked storage closets morgues filled.

As 6.16.20 Texas reports 1675 ICU beds available 1300 vents.

As cases increase guidelines put place enforced, see pans them. Thanks, protesters (both lockdown protesters BLM protesters) fit agenda. Neither car accidents. Intentional? Thieves left me, thieves right...    
Stuck poorhouse babe. Florida better Covid-19 fight governor disappears. china fun? yea they've done awesome job, Chinese takeout places ive since reopening taken seriously created wall/plastic barrier Maybe mask wearing social distancing sold as. 

It's north west.. social distancing week two, it. Yup. see going possible players isolation time. future knives warning labels . Florida man strikes turns cables labelled, big writing saying 'Respirator, unplug'

""I expected read labels!"" Wear masks. stay away other. Florida must give protection curb disease send away south Cuba. course. iron shit COVID every time arrive home. Technically, couldn’t accept buffs money raised donated New Era Detroit. finally donned buffs city Detroit’s Everybody vs Covid-19 festival “borrowed” photo op current treatment? subscribe New York Times onlyfans page?

it doesnt work like that. imagine eating something insanely spicy wash milk, water, whatever. 10 minutes later mouth still burns there's taste. like permanently. Speaking cases, anyone waiting Tulsa event begin examine crowd? I’m waiting corona eventually dies road trip pathetic country forever. Second time today Here’s one [less 2% wearing failed post one No. Two people still sex old way covid. Ask Trump. 😂 looking graph.

Yesterday 7 day moving average 596.1, today 516.9 seems like down. same. doesnt affect spice, taste. spice feel.

imagine eating something insanely spicy wash milk, water, whatever. 10 minutes later mouth still burns there's taste. like permanently. irresponsible! sickening seeing many people packed tight 1 100 people wearing masks. first one many? could go wrong? least stick lying ads TV. need rallies either party right now. indoors, people cheering (spraying droplets), maybe cough sneeze there. rallies summer really set stage wonderful August September /s. I'm super confused national guard wearing masks. anyone know? Sounds like dereliction duty. course it’s understandable don’t want divert limited resources killing unarmed citizens. seems like good idea, mentions thing gets heated 75 Celsius (167 retarded units)

You get ""disinfection"" home iron. factory workers meat plant infected North Rhine-Westphalia.  sense salty, spicy, acidic, etc cant *taste* anything. would able tell salty cereal salty dog food, jsut salty crunchy. makes think I’m educated? Holy crap. Australia. shut down, fly still day two week hotel mandatory quarantine govt pays for. still seems majority cases popping - people coming outside. still can’t travel state state. apply exemption needed. told. None second amendment crap. people protested rights many. numbers good. fan PM done pretty well this. LOL. California leading finally following Gonna Hope right, gonna act wrong. learned standards Fukushima nuclear plant disaster nearly decade ago. really? anything help end making recovery happen spontaneous? also previous injury makes much trickier!! everything described spot too. Went connecting two I've never felt joints before, ever. I've backpain injury nothing like this. Maybe I'm insane, idk feel like myself. Even old self injury felt better this. 
I wish could swim. pools open near due COVID. think might misread comment tbh.

We imposing abject misery loneliness people key phase life need loved ones most, median 5 months left live admission nursing homes reduce risk dying little bit earlier Covid-19. point?

It could using different assumptions. many days lost assuming mean Covid-19 death? many years assuming would take reach 60 percent immunity? wear mask didnt first fauci surgeon general told useless. Cant believe listened POS. 

How still job beyond me. stripped job pension. Fuck fauci jerome adams better religious know going straight hell. scientific consensus, period. 

New Zealand community spread masks. 

Again, evidence Fauci lied, many scientists done.

Again, suggestion masks may reduce transmission real-world use, seems be, I'm wearing masks public. 

Don't confuse ability find research internet ability analyze worth applicability specific scenario.  consolation though CDC lost lot credibility, FDA gained bar extremely high even pandemic. Standing private companies one thing, weird stand CDC truly something else, never heard country CDC escorting FDA official using police force before. FDA flinch. FDA still arguably best world probably Today said 86% deaths age 65. fact, people perished 90 65. He’s wrong considering know places like Italy well. fear young people come contact with. say encourage underlying issues practice harder measures protection. Hopefully Hajj season weeks away. Macomb lot may choice days. LOL. Republicans cartoonishly evil. LOL, no, get me, ex Darlene cheated me. got engaged dude cheated with, months later went jail beating golf club.

Remindme bot Well need society functioning, legitimate argument . know patiently explaining me. requires app use. Michigan app Michiganders can't use even wanted to. Well say surging said cases going - see graph right? protesters weeks back make difference all. Way go, peeps. Plus, could always stretched seven games... Utah mean didn’t everyone except lockdown would see rise cases? Like commonly accepted months ago. 1.06 reported Friday, dramatic increase.

They let lockdown early backfiring time.

This going interesting. absolutely clear money important human lives. majority stimulus money spent prop corporations stock market. recent better expected economic numbers (and Abbott requiring job searches opening like crazy) also guarantees lock again. election around corner economy literally thing Trump positive approvals pre fucking coronavirus response. paper's report cellular nanosponges effective medical countermeasure SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two types cellular nanosponges made plasma membranes derived human lung epithelial type II cells human macrophages. nanosponges display protein receptors, identified unidentified, required SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. shown that, following incubation nanosponges, SARS-CoV-2 neutralized unable infect cells. Crucially, nanosponge platform agnostic viral mutations potentially viral species, well. long target virus remains identified host cell, nanosponges able neutralize virus.

So far, vitro speculation. first doctor Italy say well couple NY think Sweden do? think strategy be? state? think baseball metaphor apt. football game guaranteed end point. There’s one overtime period. theory, baseball game trapped extra innings forever. respiratory disease telling people wear mask lol. Fauci surgeon general POS. Funny vietnam handled better got us. poorer, densely populated place.

You tell lied jerome Adam's typing caps telling people useful. Keep sucking people job inform protect public. Telling people wear masks let spread like wildfire. 

Masks thee. yet - improvement - still 30k cases day. mess guy's whole argument.

-anti-maskers wants watch finals packed bar See, simple-minded, need able connect facts together. Like, say, rate increase cases, exponential growth, number people end needing ICU beds, things like that. lot complicated HURR PIE CHART GREEN EVERYTHING OKAY.

Don't worry, everyone's cut analysis. :) guess everything bigger texas Yeah, really sure expecting happen lol Texas bout way worse New York Paging u/Mighty_L_LORT 📢 Experts say much current crisis attributed Bolsonaro’s leadership style policy decisions.

And, much current crisis US contributed (fill blank). true....at fucking all. I’ve gotten “pfft, I’m going wear mask, want live happy”. Ok Sharon, key words “live” executive order late April/May declared local governments couldn’t mandate mask use (and penalize) individuals. language says nothing local governments mandating businesses enforcing mask use employees patrons. recently said “he’s glad someone finally figured riddle” like plan make loop hole. Even that’s case loop hole intentional, it’s chickenshit leadership expect subordinate government make policy based he’s saying, instead is. 

Houston issuing mask mandate businesses starting Monday. $1000 fine per incident don’t comply. Let’s hope push right direction actually gains traction. Bases loaded! 1 out. Trump rally today illuminating confusing ways.

Watching people packing closed arena city worst rate infections state. People turning masks offered left right

But last night, several people Trump's administration admitted would wearing masks event.

It's brain scramblies. President makes wearing masks political statement. lickspittle amplify bad information. successfully get thousands older, obsese Americans cram like sardines photo OP Trump staff exact opposite.

No novelist would ever devise write story quantifiably absurd. would say believable. Oh wow, feels like years ago. Looking forward lol. See 2 weeks. Get psyllium husks Amazon. Try keep regular. Maybe, would want kill voter base? ""infection number"" completely keys number tests conducted? feel like deaths way concrete relevant. tell do. know anything me. sorry hate American. definitely circle jerk America-hate Reddit coronavirus. However, based per capital numbers, US bad many clearly also hardly contact tracing. restaurants opened area. One near us outdoor seating planning going... started thinking can’t eat mask anxiety kind took over. conservative social distancing since beginning... tough gauge relative risk kind activity. decided order in. 

The decision fatigue real, made realize certain point everyone decide fall. me, means putting public unnecessarily area virtually zero active cases I’m forced (e.g. going back office). making decision given little empathy decided take seriously. I’ve sided hypervigilance chosen willful ignorance. wish would dig head sand, understand won’t. 

When virus first spreading everyone chanting “flatten curve”... couldn’t help point flattening curve also means lengthening curve. get really bad right eyes many people willing take seriously. wonder ways, flattening curve early end fueling bigger second curve. least bought us time, I’m worried things look end summer. I'd Facebook, there's group called Pitolisant (Wakix) Narcolepsy I've following while. good read experiences others wait. Hey, that's slight us bawbags. That’s “half” population get news facts. we’re dealing with. European infections start? began Wuhan. Spread China brought countries early gonna learn epidemiology works thanks people attitude I'm confused. upset airline responsible thing exact time also responsible thing? reading wrong? day every 2 days break new record real numbers still limited testing yea experiencing sort exponential growth since early may. Sir described Vietnam handled virus well think anybody said happen.

We said course going happen. lockdowns never stopping spread, slowing long enough get hospitals could handle inevitable surge.

We that.

Then opened.

Then surges came, expected.

And doomers cried ""JUST WAIT TWO WEEKS"" weeks end. \*suprise pikachu face\* hospitals handing load fine. None hospitals overrun. Fuck rule. can't honest discussion coronavirus country without talking politics. 

The reason got hit hard initially politics. reason seeing rises South politics.

It's like trying talk baseball without talking baseball players. wouldn’t this, I’m nowhere near Tulsa starters, aren’t considering would easy someone anti-Trump positive go fuck over? What's going california? well while. bet think problem. time tho theyre small business owners wana job Nah I, pragmatic. It’s going eradicated vaccine isn’t guaranteed. I’m curious too. They’ll make sure voting super easy lines precincts favor him. Cries Florida. United States.  Congress received mail opposing entire Vietnam war. anybody lives alone seen single friend family member person since started? know couples seem still isolating (obviously could seeing friends aren’t public it), every solo person know least started outdoor activities people. category, anticipate opening back again? Would consider seeing others easier everyone outdoors, masked, distancing? emo phase then? doesnt pass go school shoot bunch 5 year olds? so? HVAC stands Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning. Air conditioning AC short covers aspects cooling. country TTI program listed CDC's website, apparently. already told that. 

nice identity politics btw. Oh! Let know Wakix is. something working getting pandemic happened heard back doctor it.

Ya, Xyrem 4.5 SOMETIMES twice night. Since anti-depressant need twice night. It’s ridiculous statement begin with. egos won’t let admit mistake. best way imo protect virus wear mask social distance much possible. Masks made mandatory. Im doctor seems like AMOUNT/ viral load exposed correlates severity symptoms. thing makes sense people completely asymptomatic / killing others. Even exposed someone, wearing mask think least greatly reduce amount might enter body. people think hoax / joke need wake protect anything family. really say this, really feature, bug. needs removed position. Problem type people hate told, like child. make look like makes big boy, might it.

This problem people driven ego. Living NE Florida like living real life game trouble terrorist town. sure trust, got isolate myself.

The economy going crater soon two weeks hospitals start filling.

Ugh. Learn states dumbass example. Stay safe everyone. Reading article, would say attribute large part Hawaii's success policies willingness containment like contact tracing quarantine early on, large number Asians ""collective mindsets"".

One downplays, important good forward looking political leadership actually containing outbreak contagious disease. Two, might misinformed others Asian nations places large Asian population control outbreak well. Third, Hawaii sizable Asian population, pretty westernized many first generation.

We see Asian countries (India, Indonesia etc) still weak response plan properly address outbreak.

Even compare collective Asian countries like South Korea, Vietnam Singapore. ignore facts countries, autocratic governments present past history. national government power willing issue punishments failure follow protocols. 

Other Westernized countries like Italy later stage, New Zealand Germany also seen great success managing outbreaks.

- speak Asian, need competent trustworthy government Asians Asian values. british boot leather taste different local authoritarian boot leather? imagine slightly bitter taste given history but... Could elaborate us? Instead using death penalty, like deadly virus ravage prison instead. Something similar happened me. first seemed like legitimate poll became apparent marketing ploy company. ended call. look horrible data day day become desensitized it, humor particular coping response fact average person 0 control numbers source racism right? makes perfect sense, intend impose (effective) restrictions measures again. Otherwise end healthcare system overwhelmed pretty quickly given double cases per day every 2-3 weeks. News won’t tell one! saying Latinx white work population? saw scenario play - open up, get sick month, close again, maybe repeat, maybe never come back.....

This fucked up.  Well, really. Denmark pretty high list world deaths per million. 33rd highest. longest time everyone lauding Denmark response, people criticizing Florida holding spring break, opening beaches early, Florida fewer deaths per milllion. Florida roughly population density Denmark. 

It isn’t fairly recently passed Denmark, might less Florida’s policies legal problems prevented stopping wealthy New Yorkers flooding rental market escape Covid NYC. EU even decentralized cases drop EU wide. 'muh rights' American Exceptionalism, bet is. PANDAS? Isnt point, US created opposition country monarch. spread power states rather central king. /s trust gut tells far witnessed increase patients. day entire COVID ICU went 0 full within 12 hour shift.   seem seeing break patterns, least might be. Definitely early sure. Maybe behaving exactly understand works well enough see that.

New cases new hospitalizations. usually trend together, reason least right looks like Florida seeing rate increase hospitalizations expect given number new cases.

Instead arguing whether Florida doomed, think focused happening. Maybe learn ways reduce hospitalizations help areas failed stop virus. would r/BlackpeopleTwitter somebody suffers IBS poop bucket. shame. also van though easier potentially poop privacy need arises. No. got bad cold got well sense smell taste never returned. Similar thing happened another acquaintance. decades ago, long anyone tested infections. well aware that. I'm Irish.

 Now, would like tell country know? Iowa surge too. Yes is, then. :( inability care personally affects I’ve spent every Father’s Day since I’ve become dad brother family. would tenth. said wife rough week work, wouldn’t coming tomorrow. night park drinking beers brother.

I guess point take solace seeing them. least they’re coming over. people rooting for/find humor in/actively hope for/brag predictions spike weirdos. get there’s difference wanting happen expecting it. But, given political nature country, seems “expecting it” events like today. I’m praying there’s spike. states showing progress we’ve done well. want go back work, want go restaurants concerts gym. want go abroad Interesting article, title trash. research form antibody *treatment* vaccine. problems get ignored eventually go away. **juxtaposition21** 🦠, kminder **2 weeks** [**2020-07-04 [**r/Coronavirus: NY also first peak.

Let sink in. giant arena different outside. lot air circulating giant arena. problem close contact happens Basketball Football, football rosters staffs much bigger. Probably lol. wish Looney Tunes Bugs Bunny cuts Florida could real right though. That's correct! NY also first peak. Let's see numbers shake 2 weeks.

!Remind two weeks WEAR MASKS PEOPLE ! 

It's thing additionally reduce infection rate 50+%. 

It needs stay till get something better pandemic burns next year. prokky dead covid I’m surprised feel ready go week. that’s great news true.  Captain obvious lmao. Nah. read signs walking restaurant advise wearing masks til you’re seated table. people don’t this. ive third world country hospitals medical missions. luxury hospital AC..... live Michigan worries most. need kind border measure make sure people spread infection. Like 14 day quarantine. dont think feasible best thing think of. A2? surprised pikachu OK right work Jersey work keeps allowing people walk around without masks on. frustrating thing ever. requires little effort yet almost everyone walks office without wearing them. 

I disappointed point. Could already exponentially growing? seems like they’re going real hard time slowing this. mean rest US? Okay, said matter *at all* public health perspective.

If, ongoing basis, ratio hospitalized vs gone down, that's extremely important changes calculus goes public health decisions. new surges happened. Give weeks. like Nevada casinos supposed open phase 3/4 sudden (probably bribe goon Murren somehow re-opening team) started opening phase 2. Now, numbers racing hospitals filling (again). Complete stupidity. Las Vegas really America's petri dish. link cites studies. Try reading Commenting social media kills mental health. need learn stop well. Oh able that. weekend sampling lull mean Monday Tuesday go number cases. Don’t know misinformation continues spread. checkpoint, fill form agreeing quarantine 14 days, that’s that. They’ll never follow you, contact you, you’re basically pinky promising quarantine. clue we’re June people still think border shut checkpoint put March Pre-print, peer reviewed. say happened US. Let's wait see actually true. It’s equivalent that. You’re moron. Let's build wall make Arizona pay it. comparison.

AZ 100 contact tracers require 4000 contact tracers. 1% people traced 48 hours.

Compare AZ outbreak MI. Timing, place curve, social distancing compliance, population density:

- Timing. usually takes 5-14 days show symptoms exposure. usually takes days symptoms person going get tested. usually takes days symptoms worsen need hospitalization. usually takes 2-4 weeks hospitalization someone die. month lag policy change (lock-down, ease lock-down, etc) see hospitalizations get affected. another month see death rate change. see lockdowns, see new case rate bottom month later. 

- Place curve. UK decent lockdown bottomed new case rate. reasonably well eased lockdown. look new case rate states like Texas Florida (www.infection2020.com), never effective lockdown cases always going (no flattening curve). 

- Social distancing compliance. many states growing outbreaks, populace (for various reasons), adhering social distancing mask wearing. UK contrast generally fairly rules-following country many people government asks. Social distancing mask wearing work reduce infection spread rate. 

- Population density. parts UK fairly sparsely populated organized towns/villages reasonably self-contained/sufficient. there's much intra-country travel. Contrast number people traveling FL vacation right now. worries, understand anger directed towards me. I'd like end too, I'm one prone anger. I'm inclined sympathy everyone. end day, human beings regardless political views. sad thing is, lot people manipulated words actions terrible man posing leader.

I want see anyone get sick. people rally mindset virus either hoax exaggerated. Air coolers India look something like this: walls air cooler lined cooling substance. think older ones grass hay. fan inside too. pour water cooler turn on. water coats substance lining cooler makes cool, fan circulates cool air outside. water level decreases, pour water again, else work cooler, it'll normal fan. Also, portable need enclosed space work. 

Also, Google evaporative air coolers air conditioners, results show different. address air coolers air conditioners. Here's one: kind rhetoric disgusting. primary reason going try kill 20k people align politically area? I'm seeing over. HA! ""Plan""! Graduating ivy league school mean common sense, morals, backbone, conscience though.... that, entire wave statues built 1920s explicitly help celebrate Jim Crow segregation. 


I get education books museums. Statues symbolic representations value. google stop updating case data since June 17th? usually go look daily case graph states counties. stopped, whats next best site look discovered injecting heat kill rona work???

/s Let speak myself: Chinese state evil actor. plague citizens world. I’m going take trade security pandemic exchange absence human rights times. way control coronavirus without kowtowing CCP. Check Greek Islands Taverna restaurant next time you’re town. get bunch appetizers. Food amazing bartenders kid excellent cocktails. What's racist it?

Ah one 

Me Latin American: "" hi, speak Spanish?""

You: "" OMG RACIST "" Exactly. Thank much Opinion: Much US culture politics revolved around money making special interests/lobbying. Many things arbitrary. staying keeping power. They're far concerned economy people's lives. branded ""war"" psycologically mind set assumes theres great enemy defeat, casualties hardships. Everything ""war"" ""battle on"" days. People go unheard, study done 20 years data collected. Essentially whether law bill either 10% approved american public, 90% approved public. still always 30% chance passing. really good video term limits university looks like cant find it/mayve suppressed? popular actor spokes personed video. Heres best could find though. dont think study another 20 year study. kept shaking head people frothing mouth actions contain transmission. wanted shake tell trying save themselves.

I was, stupidly, arguing friend’s lunatic ex wife one typical misinformed Facebook posts simplified another complicated situation 2-3 angry sentences fit narrative. 

She started ranting fact Whitmer “...won’t even let people buy seeds grow food!”, lost it. First all, lunatic, trying cordon areas stores weren’t critical immediate sense allow less risky flow throughout store. Secondly, farcical think anyone actually going harmed way couldn’t buy seeds store DAY. growing, vegetable shoots week? crazy think anyone actually seeing threat food supply. Buy damn things online! I’m entirely disagreeing you, CCP wasn’t forthcoming severity situation.. knew something happened chose cloudy it. mid March already late, January already late, December already late. circling around long before. It’s secrete CCP involved shady practises I’m saying agree line thinking. Twitter user today claiming freedom wants wants along law. arguments provide work naysayers. understand personal freedom ends mine begins things externalized impacts. part social contract, believe account mask not. Yes. bicameral legislature two senators per state looking like good idea days, otherwise idea. Even goal geographically proportional representation even that, stupid broken idea. I'm put mind little bit Tesla. Moderna never brought treatment vaccine market before, they've found efficiencies every step process make happen. 

To stretch analogy, I'm sure pharmaceutical translation panel gaps, hopefully they're something live product transformative. saw family one time May. stayed home strictly two weeks going ensure get sick, stayed outside backyard, sat separate tables based lived house since family lives three houses town. wish could go back again, really loosed since then, feel safe. depressing. used drive every month, since February I've seen one time. seen single friend since March, that's almost harder. group friends since high school (12 years ago), close. support except messaging made lonely. husband, miss support family friends. saying good thing true would mean human race return survival fittest. none anywhere near dangerous contagious this. mention, various vaccines common infectious diseases, vast majority people certain level antibodies.

This Coronavirus killing almost 20 times people flu yearly. It’s comparable.  People dead suffering joking Mah freedom wearing masks important. article regarding community spread march 6th. High schools closed march 17th. lot changed between. Italy example went ~200 deaths ~2500 deaths. plan? Great question. know means immune system isn’t recognizing it. assume means antibodies won’t created won’t picked test. Gotcha. Thank COVID actually start earlier 2019? similar symptoms, really weird issues sinus eyes. colleague lost sense smell/taste, still dealing 1 year later. Flagrant disregard health care expert opinions/guidelines. It’s moved cult 45 territory. hasn’t bad around here.. yet.. people panhandle special. spread teachers children lot lip service HSE - reality different ground. UK diabetic, extremely lucky work employer allowed shield home since mid-March, whilst still fully paying me.

I unable work home training new role.

I twiddling thumbs going slowly stir-crazy, time shitting going back office July 1st.

I know millions Britons lucky me, still paranoid going happen next, even second wave appear temperatures drop late Autumn/early Winter.

This completely unprecedented situation UK government hiding nothing whatever did, overall look countries - yes, US Sweden, I'm looking - decent job, imho.

Downplaying prevent widespread panic may reason, could worse. think next month show us whether done right thing short term. day county? Wow argument there. sub killing mental health. governor allowed cities make law like two days ago. Ducey worst reading comprehension unfortunately superior, wish better cause need conversation. 

You one continues use word ""conspiracy"".

 Everyone else agrees shitty governmental organization. certain point, possible also completely unimportant. 


Societies change. We'll dead time Bill Clinton gets statue overthrown adultery meat eating, know what? 


Future Society every right go proper channels make choices statues. Harvard law pass fail, yale, stanford. think Harvard historically grades though. I’m saying covid isn’t threat anything stupid like but, it’s straight untrue say 5.1k deaths broke previous record even though 7k-8k deaths day April. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No, escapes detection immune system. don’t even know start level ignorance. think point still works though. 

Selfishly makes sense wear one best interest people wear them. Honestly don’t know. would delay—until rally stats add :) Wow Valid point. I’m currently Sacramento make use certainly great pockets not. Looking midtown. 

Even police chief isn’t going enforce new mask policy. confirm: Brevard retirees proud wear masks oh bullshit. Slow shovelling can't catch breath.

wearing mask absolutely way restrictive breathing unless respiratory compromised restaurant wise even mask, hopelessly shape wake call, lame excuse forgets many essential workers routinely spend entire working hours wearing masks without ""gasping air"".

And want properly wear mask, remove eat, cleaning hands, properly store dispose it.

All showing ignorance. that's encouraging gives hope. family Italy. there. wear mask. do. question. everybody lost loved one friend. know stakes. here. much sadly. Honest question enforced anywhere. even la fined single person I’m really going judge anybody something I’ve considered myself, even it’s something ultimately decided isn’t worth it. Things like large house parties bars right obviously dumb, know friends gone restaurant gone small gatherings trusted friends, I’m yet, don’t think people bad things. I’m still debating want go get haircut sometime next weeks.

One thing feel getting overlooked curve states well right (New York, New Jersey, Michigan), ones getting absolutely slammed 2 months ago. feels kind weird celebrating basically front-loading curve. seem like needed get kicked ass take seriously. Hopefully southern states getting asses kicked eventually follow lead. mention we’re next door Cali Arizona. They’re absolutely blooming virus right probably tired hearing come escape weekend spread here. still morons don’t need shamed gloated pressure help save people’s lives. Maybe log internet bit seems like you’re falling touch real world. Username check situation does, ok alone thoughts order thrive situation. family member moving Florida job we’re totally freaked out. ask ID verify might get accurate info. point out, know fact.  mention convention center sponsors likely want study done. think, 600 cases June 1. kinds bad getting worse. 
We seem headed 60k Floridians dead. 21%. keeps dropping fast. Almost 2% week. need testing. cases faster dropping. anyone anywhere it’s las fined anything yet. data collection anecdotal information collected controlled manner? I'm saying Uncle Jim's story happened equal double-blind study across varying demographics large sample size. lives choices built upon collecting anecdotal information; ""I touched stove. hand hurts. again."" Sure could set study touch stove 50 times see always hurts, means risking getting badly burned 50 times. could wait 10 years enough data look back conclude CV-19 causes severe long-term health issues significant portion people, risks millions people disability poor quality life disastrous consequences. 

The anecdotal evidence pretty strong; large number people reporting months later still suffering badly virus. take years know sure many people badly affected. mean ignore them. Sorry hear missed vacation (but add: 4 weeks!! another reason Europe civilized US; salaried employees start 2 weeks’ vacation we’re lucky).

Where live Spain? Cara Christ sold soul ~~Devil~~ Ducey Florida one 12 states he’s referring to. aren’t recording testing they’re contact tracing. fine, spike purely numbers, since recently upped testing. /s Cunt guess much self worth revolves around work, seeing others, going places. Maybe needs change 🤷‍♀️ nobody unfortunately reading comment . Basically going one looong fucked wave. Oh, definitely meant tracking active addition recovered. Recovered definitely i.portant stat. Sooner later happen. mean cannot put place system control imported cases need shut borders long time. Try get tourists plus. supposed source of? says nothing FL. FL % positive tests quite high compared many states. Places like CO, NY, etc helping national numbers look better Florida quite opposite. understand I'm trying say. Good least one person does. guess choice poor words inflammatory politicaly correct world live world today. big sports fan often used watching game way distract things shitty life outside world. even tougher right many us lost huge coping mechanism time needed ever. Give time. hospitals become overwhelmed, death rate really begins spike, lockdown. things really get hand, could well actual lockdown like saw Italy Spain time around. Sweden lock anything basically front loaded death toll.

It's predicted countries eventually death toll, spread longer period time.

But still possible, although unlikely, vaccine available soon. Let's hope so. Um... dashboard shows 98 bed still available. say 19% ICU beds available within normal ICU capacity without pandemic. Stop reading headlines clicks go look freaking facts. Yeah states hit peak, states opening peak true time. clusters found track, trace isolate dying new popping up, widespread community spread coming sources Italy China confirmed leading shift strategy. mean that’s true. zillion “wait two weeks” predictions. spiking right however I’m denial that. I’m talking people seem expect spike today. what? partisan want disagree get sick ruin progress? r/eddit I'm sure lot people tell otherwise. I'd bet least 1 10 would rather swim clean across Erie go without mask. 

/s AKA- two weeks without paycheck destroy entire household maybe budget little smarter next time. always wonder going early French studies. path one drug crazy Jesus... people really posting that? Damn... Idk, dad's coworker get tested medical procedure found positive, zero symptoms. remained asymptomatic duration 14 day quarantine, also tested positive follow antibody test. live Mississippi haven’t reported case since Wednesday states reporting numbers “technical difficulties” March 8th here. running 5-6 miles per day. worked behind bar feet slinging kegs 10 hours day. 

Now can't run 2 miles without requiring minimum hour recover. Walking stairs puts ass can't pick kids without getting light headed. 

It feels like lungs smaller, like went grocery bag lunch bag. X-rays fine doctors know something's wrong I'm passing breath tests can't tell can't tell long last. 

Please, love God, wear damned mask safe. don’t provide reasoning behind color coding, made states left leaning governors popular names news cycle green. That’s works. Herd immunity, even lowest levels, takes much longer requires significantly greater levels infection. India. Avg intelligence India low. expect nothing less fuckwit governor probably even make past 3rd science class. 

Keep making masks partisan issue. Keep playing lives. Apparently consequences murderers charge, people get infected. Wow! Yep, cases can’t go don’t test anyone *taps head* Canada, provinces power states respect federal government. done pretty damn good job containing federal oversight/support province implementing containment plans. conservative provincial leaders worked well liberal federal government visa versa. think political nature problem US. US health situation became polarized partisan. Whoa almost like isolating inbreeding makes weak 🍿 Hypcondriacs

My favorite post guy said family started ignore quarantine rules. gone store day guy claimed coughing. swore COVID. majority people sub COVID. anxiety. Alight, knew Corona gonna spread event, news already starts actually surprised me. guess shouldn’t be.. ""We're dangerous ground right now, secrets lies. practically define us. truth offends, lie lie longer remember even there, still there. Every lie tell incurs debt truth. Sooner later, debt paid."" honest, sport seasons something super unimportant right now.

But also understand athletes athletic scholarships otherwise able afford college. white men though? Stupidity entitlement race gender ffs. Masks work brief contact. might allow near infected person 10 minutes instead 5 minutes without getting infected (pretty good!).

At huge **indoor** rally like this, huge number people going get sick regardless. There's way make safe.  theyve dealt epidemics already culture wore masks social distanced. Airlines care risk. there's enough demand service, they're going fill planes. decision judge risk, theirs. fully question people symptoms. Fatigue, lethargy, lack drive . It’s everything going on, it’s really easy attribute low level depression anxiety. patient go bed early last night virus? can’t stand news right now. It’s hard tell got charged $60 6 inches thread, joke. Total bill $900 three stitches. $60 literally thread, nothing more. insurance, discount. seem possible either. lived 3rd world countries. Small power outages (5-10 minutes) happen around dozen times per day. probably disabled alarms. 

Larger power outages (1-12 hours) happen week. probably turn backup generators happens.

Please don’t spread misinformation people actively wearing makes California? live I'll give one guess... live NC - [I've seen Cool story bro. go study team researchers led Texas A&amp;M University professor found wearing face mask dramatically increases person's chances infected COVID-19 virus.

Renyi Zhang, Texas A&amp;M Distinguished Professor Atmospheric Sciences Harold J. Haynes Chair College Geosciences, colleagues University Texas, University California-San Diego California Institute Technology work published current issue PNAS (Proceedings National Academy Sciences).

The team examined chances COVID-19 infection virus easily passed person person. trends mitigation procedures China, Italy New York City, researchers found using face mask reduced number infections 78,000 Italy April 6-May 9 66,000 New York City April 17-May 9.

""Our results clearly show airborne transmission via respiratory aerosols represents dominant route spread COVID-19,"" Zhang said. ""By analyzing pandemic trends without face-covering using statistical method projecting trend, calculated 66,000 infections prevented using face mask little month New York City. conclude wearing face mask public corresponds effective means prevent inter-human transmission.

""This inexpensive practice, conjunction social distancing procedures, likely opportunity stop COVID-19 pandemic. work also highlights sound science essential decision-making current future public health pandemics.""

One paper's co-authors, Mario Molina, professor University California-San Diego co-recipient 1995 Nobel Prize Chemistry role understanding threat Earth's ozone layer human-made halocarbon gases.

""Our study establishes clearly using face mask useful prevent infected coughing droplets reaching uninfected persons, also crucial uninfected persons avoid breathing minute atmospheric particles (aerosols) infected people emit talking remain atmosphere tens minutes travel tens feet,"" Molina said.

Zhang said many people China worn face masks years, mainly bad air quality country.

""So people sort used this,"" said. ""Mandated face-covering helped China containing COVID-19 outbreak.""

Zhang said results send clear message people worldwide -- wearing face mask essential fighting virus.

""Our work suggests failure containing propagation COVID-19 pandemic worldwide largely attributed unrecognized importance airborne virus transmission,"" said. ""Social-distancing washing hands must continue, that's sufficient enough protection. Wearing face mask well practicing good hand hygiene social distancing greatly reduce chances anyone contracting COVID-19 virus.""

It’s like people wearing masks go out. helps bit it’s counter productive wearing one. Much spread coming people traveling asshats don’t follow guidelines. assholes complain forced back lockdown. Sweden great comparison. 

Not really. Sweden higher number deaths per 1 million population (35% more) lower number tests per 1 million population (54% less). knows care. Honestly, fuck DeSantis. He's incapable even hint critical thinking would absolutely lost Trump available feed talking points.

That opinion though. major problem late reaction, strategy itself. lot reasons bring 3 week old baby huge indoor rally even there's a, know, pandemic. That’s would expect.

Yeah makes sense. Vietnam Thailand millions people flying like cities Us Eu. No, wouldn’t. 

The population 65 16%.  Even 100% mortality wouldn’t end 20%. It’s high, it’s like 5%. 

It statistically kills almost nobody 50, it’s 1% 60 starts going way up. 

We’ve lot deaths percentage wise gets nursing homes (places people go die 6 months year) covid finishes off. 

It’s like 1% general population New York died. spike new infections mostly occurred within past week.

False. pay payroll taxes Florida. pay state income tax. Yes, tourism dollars drive state coffers pay payroll tax every month. def good situation around graphic good, numbers uses probably correct however. 
Australia orange, meaning 100 1000 infections last week. 
The US Brazil, also Germany France red 1000.  
The statement correct, also completely useless! 
For example Germany ""massive outbreaks"" right now, believe combined currently involve 1500-2000 infections. yes problem, kind problem Brazil 55 thousand new infections yesterday alone...  
And yet graphic Germany Brazil colour everything 1000 infections lumped together. cannot stopped matter anyone.

(Where people put effort stop spread, numbers show preventative measures effective.) Bye Felicia! 100k people total event. He'll wear hat. Still great look Yeah, trucks sites.

Trailers backed loading docks trucks drive off. Okay that's probably lot accurate.

You could also try presenting data is, without trying find way exaggerate things. Referring North Korea barely step referring Hitler Nazis. weakest, laziest comparison, almost always silly comparison.

If data correct, point well made comparisons all. thing comparisons undercut argument, distract data.

Why post data? TIL 60 year olds waiting die. stop red lights. Thank protestors taking covid seriously too. virus seems catch deniers quite quickly version science using time?

Seems like Americans afraid minorities Also collect state income tax LLCs, sole proprietorships corporations. dont mind sharing, taking vit supplements prior...? hope now. real question. answer. one does. Stop committing word crimes. ""real science"" indicates proper mask usage reduces spread 50% social distancing face masks? hot sweaty especially beard work 8+ hours. feels like crotch summer, started bringing multiple masks work hot swap every hours. helped lot. win elections FL. Ignore data appeal dipshits like two Hello? Yes, would like subscribe newsletter please. Thank you. plenty. Don’t lose hope bud ""It's overwhelmingly hispanic farm workers. rest us fine"" - Ron Desantis get host Trump's acceptance speech it.

The real question is: growth rate develop? extremely naive calculation, says within week number new infections tripled. continues, be:
- 1 week: 10 000 new infections / day
- 2 weeks: 30 000 new infections / day
- 3 weeks: 100 000 new infections / day.

There new look measures one time, numbers silly. Still good chance Florida 100 000 new corona virus cases next weeks. Smh jabaited Youre badass Nope. truck. put dead sleeper. Pile em bunks hope able make full recovery. feel everyone focuses death count quality life it. think don’t die come fine end. might given enough time. 

I pneumonia last year one lobe one lung took months get over. even ran half marathon prior getting 1:55. interesting bit Fitbit time watched resting hr go 53 71. five days antibiotics brought point two day stopped taking went back 71. Took 3 months resting hr get back mid 50’s. still dont understand 3rd world country well battling break. Either numbers represented, find Vietnameses tend mostly honest (too honest times LOL) experiences. 

So numbers correct, secret game play? face mask worn 100% population, TB vaccinations, Vietnamese Genes, humidity, diet? 

Something Agent Orange back war? grasping straws here.  2% fewer trump votes Florida Pennsylvania Clinton wins 2016. narcolepsy recently read could autoimmune disease crazy. Still concrete apparently bit proof found recently.

It turns may also fibromyalgia never knew anti-depressant duloxetine (which stopped taking) treatment it. also developed Raynauds nowhere November always thought primary tbese new discoveries wonder secondary now.

Can't wait find chronic condition have!

Side note poster above. sure bad narcolepsy Modafinil Xyrem saved me. Florida's constitution bans state income tax. Whether could put sort payroll tax employers another story suspect would ton pushback. probably dissect person seriously posted feeling smug walking bunch kids wearing masks thinking “ThANk YoU” instead guy pointing situation actually looks like people don’t walk around thinking they’re saving world wearing cloth mask outside. 

Maybe dissect story she’s OUTSIDE. maybe it’s kids playing - know, group less likely get virus. maybe ask distancing running around park. 


Seems people follow coronavirus subreddit pretentious assholes, I’ll way y’all continue smelling other’s farts. shittin floor though. Right peoples throats. July 4th test coming up! announce least triple number 100k day happen. Unless want see 10k icu Thanks idiot BLM protesters broke rules indulge - won’t read r/worldnews true
They spread virus gathering scream shout r/iamverybadass too! ~2 months change minds last week talks weekends free could rent venue I’m super optimistic

The worst part mad don’t attend miracle everything fine never hear end rally, protest. story Indian news site release drug designed Indian pharma company Indian medical facilities Indian regulator - would think I'm even thinking western-world pricing?  seeing shit China trying pull border someone gets news Instagram? spend lot military, China would expanded borders now. lot 3rd world countries tackling outbreak better “Murica No.1!”, shows lot. idea, based things like antibody studies. 

You can't make stuff hunch, ignore information have. 

Well can, convincing people. Maybe grandma's got lot money share. archive [http://archive.is/nstki](http://archive.is/nstki) set yet another daily record coronavirus cases Saturday 4,000, pushing state's total nearly 94,000.  4,049 new COVID-19 cases, state's total rose 93,797, according figures released Florida Department Health. long enough matter. testing, I’m sure. know Alaska seems pretty good testing right I’m sure access drive testing since we’re residents. I’ll look that. 

We STILL going back forth whether cancel. We’ve trip planned since last August sweet grandparents isolated excited see grandkids. I’m worried cancelling absolutely destroy them, I’m also worried killing them. live small resort town Great Lakes. town population 198 booms around 10,000 summer. It’s full regular tourist season. one gives shit, bars packed, restaurants rolled back social distancing guidelines. We’re one places requires masks/sanitizing/ social distancing get tons people don’t masks pull chinstraps. shit get least 20 old people day huffing puffing walk car say can’t wear masks “because can’t breathe them” it’s crazy. There’s vacation pandemic. MO red insufficient contact tracing.

There contact tracing data available individual counties Missouri. two ""critical"" counties barely make population state data one 4 indicators. get it. “THis fReE cOuNtRy tImE oPen eConOmy!” “I ShOuLdnT wEaR MaSk”

Sorry folks virus doesn’t care capitalism political views. It’s damn virus. Reddit left leaning atheists.

Also, joke?  problem governor already said closing ( ever really first place). imagine bad things going get close again. Lmao, saved comment come back June, countries states shutting opened Exactly. virus going away. need learn live work recreate it. answers know three months ago building physical social infrastructure get back things love do. Right never interact health care workers, gardeners, store clerks, drivers, hair salons, etc etc etc. Source: 91-year old grandmother lives Jupiter gated community. I’m sorry hear that. lost family member flu four years ago I’m still terrified flu. Patricide fine job far. can’t quite help constituents backwoods morons fragile even wear mask protect others. Trump won’t pick one, he’ll certainly combine one word tap button ignores autocorrect adds phone’s dictionary. takes care them? made political issue instead scientific one. Yet. place that's handling virus better US moment. Even long over, might stay here. probably move country side like many others doing.  


Either way, I've never developed long lasting friendships anything anyone here. work go home. Maybe go motorcycle ride place mountain bike ride cool spot. typical American bar-going, club-hopping, general ""get-together"" culture something never caught onto. ""being missed"", less quietly push people life. get busy fall someone's radar, less forgotten about.  That's criminally negligent. massive protests haven’t helped cause virus. rookie numbers. Eventually, sure. many us dead then? Trump country massacre. Yes. takes care family get sick? Death cost. clear soon getting virus control better economy long run letting run. support citizens financially lockdown, economy recover Yup, I'm Brazil spot real key Korea containing virus.... I'm glad American. time I'm also living different country actually marbles together great. state everything opened up? required, widely practiced. went shopping yesterday observed 80% mask wearing (in lower mainland). went heavy handed route, many ways. I'll say right thing .

However missteps. responses certain things (the motor boat rule) well presented. I'll state reasoned want people cross state traveling home boat Marina , would sound call , case reasoning, contact gas pumps .... Issue that's problem .. direct gas stations go old way ""full service"" limiting contact pump attendant. 

As well made decisions without regard state legislatures, get political shit storm . polarity political climate absolutely horrible, one wants caught making deal devil (the opposite side) . 

Much I'll say symptoms polarization. People shouting tightly held ideals. one conversation even simple disagreement. party first mentality, feel believe major problem that's fueling many things , even wave protests riots. instead getting solutions, we're pendulum swing irritation stress swinging polar points . “Sir, aquarium supply store” haven’t tasted anything four months.

Preach. think hospitals incorruptible institutions?? would good develop extensive safety plans, case close except yakima County *cries yakima,wa native creat another problem peopke move next shit really catch 22 apparently - lets try get tourists lets expect everyone virus also. Masks common law thru states IMO enforced properly. VA mandate damn bit good. People carry around wait till half way store throw on. arguing disabilities can't wear lying. stores let must help point..I'd make wait side take list you. Shirts, shoes masks - one person subject rest health problem. End story. OK. choir practice Washington? 61 people room attempting stand far enough apart share music. 1 asymptomatic infected person infects half attendees. Two die.

Why hard understand? bothers refer air conditioner cooler. regional thing somewhere? totally agree earlier action would prevented deaths, article sort ignores fact earlier action also couple aggressive action. response US delayed compared countries, also much relaxed come. analysis included data article uses, headline text emphasize time response itself. know can't give source source saying would deemed racist. Anyone lives latinx heavily populated area knows. general course everyone social distancing masks. Like everyone like duh! hear area predominately latinx it. go store Asian parts city cause know what's what. first wear masks it. Wat? I'm also nurse working community already lost close family member TULSA. 

But I'll throw little extra soap water hands. Greeting Thailand. Last time 33 new cases 2 month ago. 33 new cases period days things would get restrictive sure. gun whole personality, penis.  People aren’t scared tho. percentage chance dying low. Seems like people willing take risk. almost CDC rudderless ship past 6 months. 

But *entirely* wrong. He's *correct* wrong reasons. luxury hindsight point made miscalculations missteps say ""these people wrong whole time! Therefore correct xperts wrong listen me.""

Also, mentioning Sweden positive light shows clue talking Another poster pointed out. I'm anthropologist, points pathogens evolving alongside humans domesticated animals seemed make sense, particularly mindset setting global zoonosis(admittedly one come domesticated animal). responded someone else's comment yes, author far perfect, found piece book interesting, bring up. *unbelievably* accurate keys one cuts person person transmission whopping 75%  apply comment way. well stopped using drug supposedly doesn’t work prophylactic.

Probably coincidence. hospitals US without AC? doubt it. Wait one state half total cases country? one state one states actually containing virus? Big oof. looks fatter normal. Stress eating? are. There's always opportunity every catastrophe, least, assholes made bank pandemic. 


And wondering assholes are, go back re-watch Trump's daily briefings paraded CEO's ""working"" get economy back running. 


Thats dumb thinks are. literally paraded goons get paid out. 


In USA, Profits People, stock market indicator healthy economy ""heros"" make minimum wage. Plus ones quarantine serious. even seen riot footage living cave ? you’d miss four Dairy Queen’s counted ride! Maybe stop getting news twitter apply grain salt? dunno tell you, seen things pan out, never seen ""hoaxes"" news sources.

The fact people understand science statistics trying formulate opinion based early studies (e.g. preliminary studies treatments, many pan out, **normal** science), oversimplified math (lots chuckleheads trying hands simplified formulas calculating death rates, example, coming different conclusions people sort thing living), scientific conjecture that, again, may may pan (e.g. Fauci worrying protests causing spike, honest may happened gotten lost noise first wave), frankly really confusing messaging (the VP US penning op-ed saying everything fine there's second wave left first wave). God idiots believe stupid shit see Facebook questions would get answers looking for, they're valid poll questions bias response. Maybe question explicitly virus protests, that's tough without biasing response baked approve/disapprove question.

Attacking beach goers silly level condemnation protests never gone far, virus threat constantly referenced politicians media figures regarding protests. Half manipulation numbers. older cousin oxygen house got crushed storm. Got moved medical facility, caught COVID died week ten days.  Cause death certificate husband got hold of?  ***Cardiac arrest*** Well considering convicted criminal running jail id say it’s public’s fault; picked lesser two evils.

Do research past presidential elections Brazil understand idea you’re talking about. mean moment idea many people actually it. I've seen real US case total guessed 10 40 million, maybe that's low.

That said, doubt higher 40 million. think Dadbod001's theory may legs ""preexisting immunity"" theory. 

The issue theory know happens, idea why, many people it, long exists  Growing South 80s, family members seriously anti-seatbelt anti-carseat, too. use them, regularly wear one bought first car college.

Of course, go around assaulting people wear them, going us. Pleasanton full idiots, entire Bay Area. This.. young healthy people unlikely show major symptoms... bit longer passing older relatives shows uptick deaths. guess. get flag like treatment. great game changing magic bullet treatment, treatment. Convalescent plasma makes huge difference (I’ve seen patients come emergency department sp02’s 50’s I’ve able discharge directly ER receiving plasma monitored several hours). less “glamorous” less dramatic treatments use also resulted downward trend death rates. also completely clueless treat March. finally, outbreak NYC control. overwhelmed healthcare system contributed large number deaths. simply able resuscitate critical patients time variety reasons. last point “flattening curve“ essential decreasing death rate pandemic like this. state ever bad NYC lack density public transit reliance. Corporations whatever appease bottom line, companies like Nike Amazon started criticizing CCP they'd lose lucrative slave labor. they're donating money give positive image certain demographics, never human rights. snowflake 😂 shared picture Facebook couple days ago conservative grandmother lit up. believes Whitmer (who calls ""Whitless"") dictator forcing Michiganders quarantine long. see they're coming rural, poor part Michigan working home never option many. time family would hit hardest hospital bill due covid. Even maps statistics can't win people. get metal nose pieces Amazon, got pack 50 $20, stick right since adhesive them. Works great fabric/cloth masks.  Mask wearing generally required BC, recommended situations 6 feet apart. 

I feel like states requiring masks four months late actions. March closed schools non essential workplaces limited care home workers working one facility banning outside visitors homes. early actions payed huge dividends. less ten people hospital COVID province 5 million. Time negligent homicide charges (or whatever equivalent Indian judicial system). say country granting $48 million dollar medical supply contracts liquor importers. Yes blame STFU. fun saving world attitude. Maybe believe friendship enough virus go away? titanic, silent, invisible gears crushing us right now.  negligence lack reversal phases inevitably lead lot unnecessary cases deaths across state. Inslee’s failure act thus far, means people leave Yakima spread it. piss poor contact tracing won’t anything either stopping yet. Phase 2/3 wrong short sited, needs solid decisions, instead following metrics phases using context. Yes know. Anyone basically data scientist call such.

She’s chick knows little bit programming. She’s scientist meaningful sense term. link video? cases coming Americas? I'm saying trust every hospital world bad practices throughout world different leadership's. Hosptials shutdown malpractices, yes high rate, also zero. I've also heard incentives insurance claims COVID like cancer make money. specifically data readily available expert listen to, things happening well. fitting narrative one could another. Families safety net pandemic separate issue US hasn’t done good job confronting.

Sure, many people might avoided hospitals prevent Covid infection died consequence. impact isn’t clear yet. 

From data put Johns Hopkins, Covid reaching upper estimate Swine Flu deaths half time. I’d like think learned lesson previous pandemic.

Technically one dies HIV/AIDS ALS. It’s typically secondary disease end taking life. Covid. Pneumonia would primary cause death many Covid patients would inaccurate say Covid didn’t cause death. people get wish talked this. saying lockdowns important friend group women home either layed working part time home husband still work.

If schools reopen get worse. could set back women pay gap decades. One vaccines built upon vaccine already went trails, got shelved longer needed.  think Moderna one. know why, fully trust vaccines. It’s apt case since Bolsonaro inspired Trump seems like political actors backed them. people behind campaigns cohorts. Sadly country accepts visitors Sweden hotspot face risk. responding idiot reopen troll. truth primary care siege decades insurers public insurance programs looking squeeze savings somewhere, since AMA longer really represents voice independent doctors primary care bears brunt insurer games cut reimbursements.

with passage ACA, required things like expensive electronic medical records shift away fee service quality based reimbursements solo private practice partnership toast. stop momentum respiratory droplets spreading far. simple thing help slow spread. selfish. funny way. one cares deaths anymore. think Floridans care. north 3 says still rising Sweden, countries locked Unemployment falling fast everyone gets back work consumers get back outside.

Swedens economy expected contract 7%, putting exact levels rest Europe, without hope restarting like rest Europe. Thank literally invalidating comment made post. cannot make complaints critiques that’s believe. Good job! 👍👍 unfair call daily infections backlog, also backlog specify such? hospitals double dipping getting money Government covid patient??

And even backlog, still 55k daily cases absurd given fact day number daily cases around 25k week daily infections werw hovering around 20k 25k.

How sudden within 24 hours, number surged 55k. hasnt happened anywhere earth.  brother sister-in-law live Duck year-round miserable opening back tourists grocery stores crowded year one wearing masks attempting social distance. locals know wear masks everywhere go. cannot say strategy failed. opinion based hypothesis. Every time point you, fail address question. fact, every time challenged something real answer, simply choose ignore it. basically governor saying fuck it, let spread see happens. Denmark Norway prove otherwise. article really poor job laying responsibility Congress.

All problems article mentions solvable least addressable.

We know solve housing. know solve job risks. know provide social distancing capacity.

We choose US care people. Lol bolso bozo feel going protest? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Roughly 30-35% loyal base involves people age 60. That’s concerning. number increases considerably look certain cruise lines/itineraries cater retired couples. person A's stupidity kills Person B, natural selection. Sports employ thousands regular people, sports doesn’t effect fans, lot people work this. President Florida's Chamber Commerce said Florida would ""the global model"" reopen. remember hearing radio thinking obvious bold lie guy selling.

Guess business leaders best ones make decisions science public health all! individual antibody tests fairly useless. studies involving enough people not, though still pretty large range. depends study course (the methodology, tests, etc). 

Anyway, making something feel way far, far useless. somewhat obvious time numbers released. curve un-natural flat plateau consistent epidemiological models. Moreover, suspicion time artificially keeping numbers 1000 avoid political significance 4 digits. Maybe im wrong thought corps pay taxes nationwide. runs employees love idea man whose talent born rich stealing taxpayer money enrich buddies. reading tech documentation system. lot documentation available actually hold degrees Computer Science, worked many years communication, data security, information privacy.... 

The system depends random keys, phone generates, change every 15 minutes so. phone exchanges keys nearby phones, using bluetooth, whenever two phones near other.  person diagnosed, keys recently generated phone uploaded server. Periodically, phone downloads keys reported server, compares keys phones near.  personal identity information (PII) never shared, transmitted, stored outside phone. random keys shared, keys contain PII. 

The privacy scheme impresses pretty good.  security privacy hole, see yet. 

The thing concerns technical. *the opt-in problem*.  seems people already wear masks social distancing, people download app opt-in technology. People refuse wear masks, refuse distance, deny virus even real, not.  suspect people opt-in, precisely people likely catch disease. And, people opt-in, ones least likely.  sociologist psychologist, area outside expertise.

If update software people need download app start key exchange process, notified without needing opt-in -- might work well. But, small fraction people opt-in, work. effective, needs cover large fraction people -- basically everyone smart phone.  places fact “forcing” wear it. Grocery stores example. shop somewhere else choose shop one requires masks it. see infringement rights. 

Ironically, people also pushed businesses right deny service came serving people LGBT community. Yeah. Alaska. New York. Effingham FTW! also could done strict lockdown one month delivered water MRE packages everyone. 

In theory, is. government incompetent pull off. Even though Brazil took one team attempting show exponential growth looks like virus. know people look Brazil look future anything stop it. Sample appeal letter:

Please donate Trump 2020 remove ventilator. Help bury Biden bury you! meme made deal knuckle draggers........it eiher pisses like Bilbo reaching ring one last time makes retreat confusion. coronavirus roughly 100 times infectious 20 times lethal flu, absolute donkey. 

Not anti science avoided question. line deaths acceptable enforce masks social rest said stupid even worth acknowledging TBH. Stop spreading dangerous disinformation.

Ironic baffles well. talking reopening number worse started lock down. 99.5% people ""will make this."" I’ve hearing Florida disaster stories months now. hasn’t happened, don’t know why...vitamin different hospital protocols, living density knows what. aren’t spike deaths basically haven’t COVID. combination. limit car spreads 7mph? could stop traffic deaths. Agreed, terrible officers deal dangerous disease. likely young relatively healthy (if instagam indication haha!) one hopes come ok, always chance bad luck. 

I *think* Iceland laws charging people recklessly put others risk infection, tbh know sure! do, think definitely applied here. 

As stands article makes sound like fines / deportations consequences. article says date changed, situation changes. nice see sub mass gatherings again.  spoken yeah admit seen book rec posted like 5 times 2 days residual frustration built. Sorry 'directed' style writing worded less personally Remember Fl wanted keep people states high numbers traveling there. Northeast now. remember conspiracy theories actually kind neat fun secret societies, alien cover-ups like.

Now 99% filled racist dog whistling.

That sub cesspool. checking resting heart rate? 1 Lakh = 100,000 anyone unfamiliar term personally go [this website. look promising based 2 week rolling numbers. many people involved get data. Plenty countries much closer victory much less sacrifice America. long everyone takes laissez faire attitude like amount sacrifice gets worse time takes gets longer.

You may realize spreading attitude also part problem. ""yOu dOoMsAyErS."" That's funny part Trump's mind. him, punishing China halting flights right thing. he's dumb realize US nationals spouses still permitted fly China. create mad rush people flying might otherwise waited. Implementing federally mandated 2 week quarantine incoming flyers China would erased China source (at least short term, people would avoided flying anyway due 2 week quarantine. 

Watching Trump operate real-time amazing insight utterly incompetent is. born ultra rich really accomplish 99.9% work. Actually complicated. countries may temporarily beaten virus back came huge cost outbreaks again. open question whether people living countries would tolerate another lockdown. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seems like Ireland problem Sweden's neighbors Scandivania.. can't even believe still discussing masks

i can. president said people wear masks like him. problem “test subjects” won’t get tested, since it’s “hoax.” state, many states. think that’s selection bias. people going restaurants aren’t ones taking precautions, therefore less likely wear mask. We’re saying thing NY numbers started rise deaths lagged? thats luck you.. food runs. thing working home.. dont go dont get paid. work jewelry kiosk mall. people nonstop trying necklaces such, ways want us help put on. single customer wears mask get right faces breathe heavily. awful.

We also ear piercings, try refuse absolutely asinine, could get fired. areas, yes, mostly not. That's stereotype really need new thread every imported case NZ? They’re quarantined isolated arrival like Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Tunisia... Human stupidity always killed humans. way obvious direct right now. Also, see previous comments. went walk morning NYC, every single person wearing mask. grateful live place people take seriously. Outdoor seating opens Monday big first test, hopefully screw Fernando Haddad running jail. ""CoRonAviRus iMPEacHmeNt sCAm""

Glad see Trish Regan unemployed now. Flattening curve reduce area curve.

That depends done. primary reason prevent pandemic exceeding hospital capacity.

The lockdowns cost us $12T far. fraction money, could already greatly expanded permanent hospital capacity, increased amount resources available training medical professionals, research. 

With $4T, could built around 2,500 high end hospitals would fully funded, ignoring revenues, ten years. hospitals could handle total 300,000 patients time, even functioning capacity ([calculations available back total cost around $6T).

Yes, would taken while. perhaps near term, people would died. terms ultimate number lives saved quality life improved, lockdowns total failure.  Stay strong India. Anyone common sense agree Sweden's approach blueprint everything dealing w pandemic... lockdown foreseeable future many states announced(Karnatakazthe state living announced it).So yeah gonna lives. happens turn pandemic partisan political issue. thought phrase was:
Muscles bulked kitchen abs shredded gym. don’t think there’s ton argument particular point. geography wasn’t factor determining fate societies one society made active CHOICE eradicate other. wasn’t cosmic accident.

For example, colonizers [passed smallpox-infected blankets sick wards native systematic effort eradicate them. Must suck afraid disease need nuance question get good answer Fauci said terms guidance public, accurate time based info. nothing points saying terms govt needed time. needed govt pressure put china allow CDC teams access china, read pres declined bc prioritizing trade deal efforts. Likewise woeful efforts get testing going, afaik directed fauci. US flattened curve yet, 30,000 new cases today. know going end people keep ignoring science facts. That's nearly half *total accumulated* infections Canada. Absolutely insane. strange article April 6 seems say heard sentiment fellow doctors across United States many countries. asking: patients heart attacks stroke? missing striking many emergencies disappeared. Heart attack stroke teams, always poised rush save lives, mostly idle. hospital. fellow cardiologists shared cardiology consultations shrunk, except related Covid-19. informal Twitter poll @angioplastyorg, online community cardiologists, almost half respondents reported seeing 40 percent 60 percent reduction admissions heart attacks; 20 percent reported 60 percent phenomenon specific United States. Investigators Spain reported 40 percent reduction emergency procedures heart attacks last week March compared period pandemic hit. see deliberately ignored part using lock get rest control.

As China, recent issue novel vector, frozen food. person person, generally case. reason able sleuth used lockdown eradicate disease domestically.

In nearly country, nobody would even notice one odd case precursor outbreak &lt;150 people. Doesnt surprise me. cant imagine contact tracing work USA people obsessed privacy. reply argument childish someone needs say you. still staying social distancing? Turning invites gatherings? friends acting nothing going anymore. don’t even wear masks. live US way. genuinely result testing. ever stopped cops? 14 days timeframe health experts agree COVID-19 symptoms typically appear. 

I thought average range 4-7 days. agree mask thing go back normal life full throttle? I’m     America, nobody knows dont really care soccer mls gets worse, air marshall taser fuck put mask they're handcuffed seat. TIL. Wow. Never thought state police force...figured every jurisdiction - city, county, state, fed LEO's.

Edit: state troopers (highway patrol), talking about? Selective enforcement? Fire them. list done better us United States. many Americans see Scandinavia one best places live Europe, better social safety nets happier citizens. 

Norway great response COVID-19. results best Europe. haven’t heard much Denmark I’ve heard decent (all things considered course). offense intended, US clearly much global embarrassment, think we’re mostly surprised see Sweden take permissive response COVID. Ok that's reasoning wearing mask now? 🤦‍♂️ think it’s businesses. don’t mask can’t come in, aren’t wearing right asked leave. businesses don’t enforce maybe face fine, don’t know. least people indoors probably one. Jan test neg antibodies - it’s thing could 12-18 months away many claiming one ready end year. China Oxford vaccines claim done easily end year producing go ready. believe Johnson Johnson also believes could ready end year (even though dont trust much Oxford). People keep claiming 12-18 months isnt accurate resources put particular vaccines. r/conspiracy fucking sucks. It’s filled misinformation circlejerking actually yes started new med yesterday side effects shitty 

thanks asking :) American victory. Beating everyone COVID cases. People Spain Italy locked away 2 months still cases. vaccine end 2020 that's proven safe enough would best case scenario everything R development went flawlessly. Look long took get dengue vaccine deployed still major issues it. worldwide total going 10 million end June, doubt mind.  Given average age cases plummeted, suggests they're correct: rate whole world going send American corner think it’s actions. forced quarantine per se. Might even lead pretty big war cuz babies want play pens ? condition anti-science lack compassion. North Carolina state police, that's going work. wearing masks remain socially acceptable even fashion trend COVID-19 subsides? 

This could start societal change. I've seen stylish masks people always cellphones, cameras, things pockets significant portion population may want continue wearing masks public long over. Theory he's testing waters rallying states matter. He's basically guaranteed win OK regardless, states. Again, theory.  guess fixate exclusively mask-wearing recommendations alleviates anxiety thinking hundreds miskakes made currently made. crazy cases spike like even school session. imagine spike southern states declare second wave send everybody back school! correct already late. school project regarding Covid19 right. end July, Brazil pass US. $$$ all... Imagine saying ""the US surges 67 new cases"" look Sweden, who's trying Herd Immunity thing. 5,000 people died, cases still climbing. Denmark 600 death cases falling. Norway, 244 deaths. Finland, 326. gave good chuckle 🤭😁 Covid sucks people healthiest go careless catch survive, end giving people vulnerable careful die. lot people dumb enough connect dots. NBA season already. season done scrapped start new season fall possible. lot NBA players dont wanna play right anyways. IL testing 30k per day still roughly half population. 


It's great. Definitely research shows antibodies diminish 2 - 3 months accurate. I'll take non-rebuttal admission I've argument too. I'm defending all, criticize time recommending widespread mask use. make things do. 

They never said virus can't transmit H2H, said there's ""no clear evidence yet"", also issued warning probably transmit H2H based history corona viruses, know much clear be. 

They confirmed H2H world day China sent confirmation. interesting important fact part headline based statistics things gone. Generations mainly gone one gets better precious worked so. Think boomers parents grew depression war prosperity. 
 course boomers ranges mid 40s early 60s, results see show generation worked better themselves. ( all) accuse millenials (80- end 90s) bit ambition, killing industries jobs buy homes. world someone could buy home simple workers salary gone. Economies worked make profit moment look future, jobs pay get better, things like university healthcare processed soaring far inflation. 
  born boomers still ones charge governments companies, put money anyone else. pay living wage store cuts profits bonuses. 
 Then, wonder younger generations apathetic view lazy. opportunities parents worked make possible them, took away children disgusting sad.

Endangering lives crew selfishness jerks need see women smile serving them. even dated black guy turn around hate black lives matter protests

i'm bitter lost friend also happy showed true colors months met. mostly annoyed little ringleader multiple people wont talk me. 

sorry vent post nothing you, carry mean. Great decision, Oxford hits dream guidelines vaccine mass distributed January 2021 (which claim possible. saying happen). June 2021 seems like could excessive especially extend Next plenty refrigerated trucks, plenty ice rinks Fuck guy. Wonder Orange County police do... Strong people feel need fight every possible battle know right thing.

Covid protests really shined bright light weakest society. Yeeeeeesh. 

Ok, thanks dude. Stay safe. world faced many 'pandemics' like [many times recent years. one different?

It's flu (like link), extremely infectious, IFR around mortalities C-19 follow pattern everywhere across world regardless measures taken - strict lockdowns without seen exact pattern: death rate hits level peaks, declines steadily. debatable effect lockdowns all.

Mask wearing social distancing turning important factor. Focusing ""lockdowns"" myopic. pattern everywhere. South Korea, China, eastern countries seen curves bearing little resemblance examples Brazil, Spain, UK, US, slow adopt mask wearing, slow contact trace, etc. Please tell riskier shit pesky COVID.... like daddy trump. Clear, concise raw. portrays everything I’ve ever felt last years. It’s definitely sign compassion consideration right now. Especially live hot spot area. said, still sometimes forget take mine dash put going store. usually go back it, like “I’m going run out”. funny thing is, probably liberal public figures don’t wear masks won’t anything that. Aka liberal elites manipulating using take country. It’s conspiracy, it’s obvious guess would say ""science truth"". think like ""science seeks truth"" hypothesize, marshal evidence (always subject measurement error), draw conclusions must always tentative subject revision light future evidence. Theories tend ""consistent"" models ""incomplete"". Hopefully useful. Unfortunately many people get nuance want unattainable certainty. Cases trending up...so expect deaths cl9mb again. Soooo Translation: Everyone truth... thought moved outdoor venue? live Tampa bay. vast majority buinsess employees wearing masks No, trolley problem two options face outcome--death. case here. melodrama embarrassing. Well teacher probably savings husband working well. People work Disney paying rent, buying food etc living pay cheque pay cheque literally broke 2 days get paid. missed 6 days, big deal. People striking place like Disney striking scared getting virus, would strike lot longer 6 days . Good shit! r/Masks4All 30,290.

worldometers 27,000 cases interestingly enough can't explain why.

but show 30,000 cases day bad news. Tuvix Voyager? actually know made executive decision recommended masks (Fauci uses ""we"" lot), whoever blood hands.

Jerome Adams definitely fault -- lie tweet really blatant. Fauci least equivocates he's trying hold something back. Yea, feel like anything gonna turn Trump fans away Trump, gonna everyone know suffering dying disease got rally told worry about. young healthy people going getting tested, coming back positive little symptoms. New death rates continue decline.

FL TX nowhere near death rates per capita states Northeast, reason states looked done things right. get appendicitis, something God can't cure. doctor one hour. see doctor. like POTUS proposed... 33000 new cases today. It’s bad. People really struggle delayed lagging indicators. Fact takes time initial diagnosis die. whatever confirmed cases currently wont die week two.

Its similar spread. directly open expect see cases going up. takes weeks people spreading cycling person person. management think going happen? 
Were betting would lucky? Phil Murphy handled well, shame soo many people still rag him, support living shit someone genuinely let public opinion stop needed be, done keep deaths minimum. forever grateful. testing shines small flashlight big room. LMAO comments....""these polls taken DNC""

You can't make shit up.  Daily deaths trending so... What’s difference “we might be” vs “likelihood” reality? lot people holding onto fact early projections overblown going first lockdowns. granted lot people don’t take account lockdown measures curtail projections.

But see thing happening again. We’re seeing projections [American] public still mindset before, added complication economic recession.

I’m wondering reality pandemic getting lost people. months ago, people I’ve around neurotic cleanliness. it’s distant memory people starting resume “normal” lives. while, businesses starting open record cases reported.

Not sure I’m going rant, that’s pretty much thought process atm. Welcome America science political compassion/consideration sign weakness There’s gonna many get severe symptoms they’ll end needing medical intervention. that’s data tallied bad day today? doubt majority attendees Tulsa- they’re probably coming over. That’s scares me- get infected bring back spread around hometown. Many us fighting good fight-please don’t think all, even Americans stupid. disproportionate number loud assholes refuse believe science though, it’s incredibly frustrating. I’m rural area 80% people grew right wing, kinda went way, regardless it’s shame became politicized here. Pandemic response public safety political thing.

I look back see country pulled together WWII I’m seeing nothing like happening today, it’s really tough watch midst of. stupid- premiere online webinar. 

The technology cut middle man, studios complicit spread don’t evolve times. States deserve representation frustrating huge cause voter apathy vote much less weight value California would lived North Dakota. excuse awful system marginally fairer direct democracy/popular vote. would Tuvok + Neelix. got nose sticking mask time. Still trying force us family get togethers, still wanting go shopping multiple times per week. good. Small hospital near type self preserve Deplorable results? understand fact can't smoke cigarettes hardly anywhere US, feel like there's much pushback laws. mean sure, there's some, nothing like this. facemasks different smoking? Thanks. poor job articulating possible 14-day timeframe.

It’s probably better explained: 4-7 avg start symptoms, 2-4 days symptoms worsen getting covid pcr test, 2-3 days results reporting. think also likes excuse stay home lol Boy people subreddit really like new normal fuck?? I’d call cops asshat he’s eating get handcuffed dessert!! Science description method, scientists individuals practice method, Directors CDC political appointees whose principle purpose nothing truth. significant amount bad science produced endorsed US government service corporations want pad bottom line. Never automatically trust authority owes job back door dealings politicians. mean *basically* lie. agree one. know *meant* doesn’t protect *individuals* public getting (presuming we’re talking cloth/surgical here, seems imply N95 mentions HCW), twist contort logic hard avoid dissonance, it’s really lie.

We knew surgical masks help prevent spread respiratory viruses even COVID-19, knew pretty damn well N95 masks effective protection high risk sustained close contact situations HCW’s. isn’t something really changed time.

However, also tweet recently. 

I suspect tweeting frustration lack PPE HCW’s first one. Here’s thought: maybe public officials meetings discuss message come present publicly, together, unison instead off-the-cuff tweets. [This article says use Since start SARS CoV-2 pandemic, Dr. Anthony Griffiths, Associate Professor Microbiology Boston University School Medicine team working developing tools support scientific advancement field.2 research treated inoculated material different doses UV-C radiation coming Signify light source assessed inactivation capacity various conditions. team applied dose 5mJ/cm2, resulting reduction SARS-CoV-2 virus 99% 6 seconds.

Edit: Searching Signify site ""far uv-c"" ""far uvc"" yields hits. :( Pants, however, remain optional. TL:dr yes, plus, social distancing, masks. 19k people INDOORS cheering shouting chanting. Sounds like trainwreck waiting ti happen. still live here? equivalent saying ‘Strong people don’t take shits floor public places, compassion others’

YEAH, SHIT! (Pun def intended)

Embarrassing even mentioned US :/ saddest part much could prevented everyone would wear mask. it’s red vs blue issue red side doesn’t believe wearing masks, are. Oh god! Luckily GM mama bear comes literally endangering health staff. We’ve gotten pushback regarding arbitrary stuff, park masks haven’t it. What's point making people wear mask later allow take eat? agree. Lord knows we'd larger mess McCrory still office. Read few, mistake.

Here's 80% them: ""I've never asked take poll polls fake""

It's intellectual wasteland there. Reporting worldometers is. Brazil 55k. 55k. That's whole stadium. Majority voted someone else, importantly plurality voted singular candidate. Thanks, makes lot sense. Apart inexplicable desire discuss potential driving routes great length, SoCal pretty similar NorCal. case far Raleigh State relatively based post Covid events. Finally compassion. Thank you, that’s justice? treated Ebola patient 2015. patient lived. Well also better treatment. first ventilating everyone really that's necessary quickly. know able find something exist made up.  [we already know turns  second site different cutoff (12am PST) worldometers. large counties (notably Travis Texas, San Diego California, several Louisiana) heavily-impacted states (North Carolina Mississippi) still reported today numbers still increase, assuming places actually report today. divine right eat establishment.

To end, patronize restaurants DONT wear masks. Use mask, dont worry gloves. Always wash sanitize much possible Let’s say work around lot cars, ran almost ran Yeah choices. Ah yes sovereign citizens. Next time tell may right free travel Coronavirus not. Congratulations deniers memed ""two weeks"" two weeks ago. sarcastically predicted second wave. would shocking didn’t. Deaths would 0 free healthcare free prescription medication... Also PA, Lebanon County deep shit pasty chunk homunculus wear protect families/friends. mandated California wear face mask. Hi all! diagnosed officially today. day 2 symptoms day 6 partner. I’ve completely lost sense smell partial taste. 

Anyone else experiencing this? strange sensation. ""for reasons sometimes inconceivable""

This right here, flabbergasting people dismiss science. understand frustrating  knowledge changes, science always updated. fact people expect scientists know absolutely everything knowledge gained results changed people think ok dismiss everything.

This coronavirus prime example, literally brand new course understanding going change time. minute something changes idiots come ""see wrong that, must wrong everything else"" said pandemic yet, fit criteria time. time said came bats that's scientists also thought. none lie.  can't believe absolute bare minimum consider actions affect others makes people feel weak. people need therapy. worms brains. love false equivalencies.

Nobody organizing protests. antifa left wing leadership responsible calling ""leftist mobs"" onto streets. 

All scientists said ""these protests going problem, go, go wear mask, stay distant.""

Trump - president US - organizing this.

Unlike protests, one person could say ""this good idea"" people would safe. won't. literally care people die re-election. apparently brain dead base either. worst part people aren’t going Tulsa. come everywhere go home everywhere US. refuse wear masks infect Americans city State. unfortunate. wear face mask.

It's ""strong"". actually give shit fellow human.

I want die coronavirus.

It's simple that. sooner people mask up, sooner end Yep, science denying R E states get fucked. I’m sure patrons sit 2+ hr movie eating drinking wearing masks. Better stock toilet paper Whatever say bud. ones wearing wrong. Stop making armchair diagnoses using terms learned week ago pointed complaining problem already solved. inherently wrong say cloth masks good N95 masks, need give correct information say shit thats wrong ends justifies means, N95 filters virus dont breath in, cloth masks keep people spreading offer protection catching it. heard booze cruise?

Let present Flu's Cruise. ICE detention. Cruise ships really weird HVAC set ups aren’t like facilities though. Plus people don’t go rally week time share bathrooms buffets.

Cruise ships already-known specific kind hell viruses :-) anybody look around America today say country better four years ago?

Record-shattering unemployment, top global epicenter new disease, mass civil unrest...

Great. wonder they'll even allow guests hug touch costume characters anymore. Think germs end Mickey Mouse line 100 kids hug row. Likely lot increase tied reopening states death toll lags behind new cases weeks. could also young people getting infected better outcomes comparing getting nursing homes beginning. Wow, we're #2?! Hold rallies Mr. Trump! worry. We'll catch soon. We're #1! We're #1! I've gotta give NASCAR round applause interviews reopened. worries. world rife terrible people treat others terribly stupidest reasons imaginable. even harder invest emotional time energy people turn rotten core.

I'm really sorry. worst kind betrayal. Venting a-ok me. 

It's much, remember lot people there, colors, regardless ever truly understand go through, alone working demanding bullshit end good. Didnt say boomers I, yes many protest things. also many it. People sub still act like thing seizes lungs contact. Clearly healthy younger people little symptoms all. view people wear masks aggressively stupid inconsiderate. idea idea 'strong' comes from. moronic jerk. Americans ignore science time Again, 96.5% known cases only.
The serological study done Israel suggested 11-16 times cases ones known time.
I conservative say actual cases currently ""only"" 3 times higher.
So ""at home cases"" percentage changes 99%. also diagnosed mid 30s. basically told well you’ve made far you’re probably fine don’t really need change anything  Lol remember people celebrated Sweden’s approach. Smh Evidently, didn't. matter waiting see what's going happen end. Stop gaslighting people I'll stop arguing thing trying gaslight people about. covid q terrifying disease. preexisting conditions. young two children. urge people walks life take seriously \*In USA. Plenty nations get sorted out. seal did. TLDR; yes. Fuck yes. Exactly. Clickbait title local news FYI. Death lagging indicator; people usually expire day they're first tested. often happens weeks diagnosis. even then, take weeks death reported. looks like [hospitalizations may ticking although soon say real trend. many haters sub follow link, already English. Rondolat said company’s UV light able eradicate 96% coronavirus three seconds exposure. goes 99% six seconds exposure.

That's impressive. article mention wavelength UV they're using. covid purposely underreported..information suppressed want things go back normal. alarming symptoms r beinv ignored state I've looked age data. daily increases usually main dashboard, either available feed bots create changes totals.

I see could efficiently track comorbidity infection onset, first contact would testing, goal test rapidly want allocate lot time screening. probably much difference versus general population given demographic / region, except hopefully people really bad vulnerabilities know take extra precautions. possible chose post this? wrong you? Good two safe. skin cancer much though Well could actually prove it, maybe people would believe. could tell people trouble I've traffic tickets. Even post screen shot history. Problem is, could lie. Case point days, sit day long telling people I'm rich pedophile, expect everyone believe local news also said so. get people power ability influence public, people also free access health information. like people can't things without told it... right? Paying $175 neurologist bill 20 minute video appointment bitter pill swallow helped guess that’s great. Hang friend. know trying funny mate, that's awful thing say. July 11 way early. Universal studios open per commercial saw TV today, though. 

He horrible mistake. Apparently that’s one thing FL right, governor refused let covid patients back long term care facilities nursing homes. weak minded, insignificant, self hating people, feel way. Ooo dark \~ &amp; made laugh (;  lead depression mass unemployment homelessness, possibility getting flu going look hell lot appetizing years depression. Wake people. Think happen people start opting things can't mask - going gym, bars, restaurants, college classes, theaters. cities die out. People fly. basically already happening. Remember, Reddit bubble/hivemind. IRL people want pretend walking around mask normal. job chopping block. really want unemployed broke pushed hard people wear virtue signalling piece fabric face? Giant Eagle Walmart, openly refused mask son didn’t. explained laryngomalacia, told masks mandated per stores rules turned away. get need masks, establishments taken far made hard people like son. I'd like know getting statistics.  Wait... earth round?   Well shadow PACs launched campaigns wearing + people mistrusting authority + lazy = mask wearing North Carolinian here....I absolutely disgusted walked big box sports store tonight saw around 50 people wearing face coverings. felt like outcast like something wrong wearing mine. company work made requirement wear masks anytime campus it’s slowly becoming way life family I. 

It kinda heartbreaking see families store giving 2 shits health, kids health anyone else’s. Gov. Cooper done fairly decent job (I won’t say he’s perfect), believe needs state mandated face coverings. 

Stay safe y’all. get together. mean? wrote ""get gets""   know couple people actually died car accidents. know anyone suffering even little bit COVID1984. lol even argument! It’s “infringing rights” wear mask someone’s poor grandparents don’t die!  Agree Tommy Vercetti remember name. #LOL CNN George Soros $500, Alex? bet large overlap people spend lot money lottery wear facemasks.

They think good chance winning something abysmally small odds, almost chance contracting something contagious relatively (to diseases) good odds kill you. definitely used help us survive point evolution inadequate world brought existence causing widespread depression anxiety massive populations. Covid-19 kills people every single demographic far flu. idea talking about. Yeah, member Trump administration, surprise americans paying much mind logic science. think sounds like ""conspiracy"", ask - mean truth sounds like conspiracy?

It usually means actually read article may understand scientifically illiterate comment is. crisis hotline people waiting talk. Please give call agree, stay safe too! 0 would also median, since chance death would either 0 1. absurd example. point want use median here. understand still arguing that. half deaths happen people assisted living facilities &lt;10 years live means nothing half. Nah, worst offenders elderly. Hit 'em nostalgia-loving hippocampus Patriotism (TM), skip part age. They're mostly trying reduce amount product coming in. They're limiting shipments essential items, like food, medicine, dildos, butt plugs, etc. lot people wearing masks others, themselves. Better mask all. got woman gas station must 80’s! Like lady, virus would take *down*. said “I’m favor! It’s like chicken pox.” friend said, “I hope doesn’t affect trip Hawaii”. *furious*.

But lot people - don’t know anyone who’s it, haven’t personally affected, certainly don’t know anyone who’s sick go hospital died. it’s lot easier convince doesn’t exist it’s overblown. doctors getting better letting patients die. 

For instance, I’ve seen ICUs begin flip patients bellies prevent blood pooling back lungs, since humans spend 16 hours day feet 8 hours back.

Small changes way administer treatment make lot difference.  That's gonna get people like told do. guess call strong finally wearing masks acting nuts store makes them. It’s hard imagine anything stupider risking life piss people don’t like. US citizen, agree endorse message. refuse go bar resturant makes wear mask. trials successful vaccine 6-8 months away. Give take month actually produce it. deadlier flu every age group case entire *world* case. Nobody decently behaved this, *nobody*, all, ever, anywhere. Lmao means go ahead “Juneteenth” rallies BLM protests! surely won’t spread virus! Antibody titers diminishing several months thing losing immunity entirely. NBA supposed arrive month...oh boy wear mask, confirmed smooth brain 3.6 roentgen great terrible confirmed cases. many prior contexts seroprevalence studies showed actual cases 10-50x number confirmed cases I’m soon lease up, realize it’s privilege say that. refuse wear mask. co-worker says quit company makes it. 

Lucky him, company basically nothing. think South Korea good gauge case fatality rate. 
280 dead / 12,373 infected, 2.2%. 
Now definitely unhealthier US, maybe 3%. insanely high, 1 33, think extended family, classroom, office floor, 33 people... shit wild. wear fucking mask anything else don’t know won’t spread it? difficult? would suggest keep hospital even infectious time? plus massive influx people coming in? lesser two evils opinion That's case maybe walk street dick hanging out. know, First Amendment rights everything. Ugh, that’s frustrating. hate working mask, walk average 8 miles I’m shift. It’s hard talk people, deal food, interact anyone, care patrons coworkers.  Legally. Yeah. fuckin sucks here. Imagine people protesting that. like distracted us something. would react virus 20% death rate?

""Wear mask get shot.""

At least, would hope.

We're headed direction, US. tens millions infected, things going get real, quick. nothing DeSantis everything FL becoming hotspot

And DeSantis head ass nothing FL becoming hot spot /S TOP 5 NEW CASES USA

1. Texas +4,497 *NEW RECORD* 
2. Florida +3,822 *NEW RECORD*
3. California +3,608 
4. Arizona +3,246 *NEW RECORD* 
5. Tennessee +1,188 *NEW RECORD* 

Texas blocks Florida top spot. Congrats Tennessee first-ever top 5 appearance! There's lung damage fraction fraction 1% 30 year olds.

The flu kills hundreds kids.

All latest data points Covid-without-vaccine deadly flu-with vaccine.

I understood panic March. point need help. I'm pretty sure America solved first wave yet. true UI, feeling safe work nothing sweep rug either say guy worked armed security 10 years back day.

Fair point parents, trying say losing job Disney going right starving death bit stretch vs bringing something home could kill folks they’re still around.

I’ll also say I’m going back work soon(have fortunate enough work home since Covid hit) I’m going need pay mortgage, hear ya, concerns work pale next huge theme park swamped people refuse wear mask politics. Cool, wear mask it’s even rarer. Really hard shouldn’t effect way beyond piece cloth face.

Don’t selfish. interesting issue regarding ""decreased deaths"" CDC's excess death numbers.

When looking reported deaths per region, CDC found *fewer* deaths average, set zero. argument unable tell incomplete reporting, bona fide low number deaths.

It's [methodology section CDC nobody ever excess deaths US overall computed sum jurisdiction-specific numbers excess deaths (**with negative values set zero**), directly estimated using Farrington surveillance algorithms. Summation (rather estimation) chosen account possibility jurisdictions may substantially incomplete data jurisdictions report may deaths expected, negative positive values cancel estimating excess deaths US directly using Farrington surveillance algorithms. data finalized (typically 12 months close data year), **it possible determine whether observed decreases mortality using provisional data due true declines incomplete reporting**. Thus, computing excess deaths directly US, negative values due incomplete reporting jurisdictions offset excess deaths observed jurisdictions. example, total number excess deaths US computed directly US using Farrington algorithms approximately 25% lower number calculated summing across jurisdictions excess deaths.

So interesting. would turn 

+8, +4, -3, +1, -5 = 5

.. ..

+8, +4, 0, +1, 0 = 13

Basically .. regions reporting fewer deaths normal, seems disregarded ""zeroed out"". there's easy solution this: skyteam alliance partners refuse board garuda's passengers connecting flights. i'm pretty sure alitalia, china eastern, china southern, korean air, maybe even delta want passengers infected. leopard eat face voters always shocked leopards eats face, news get sick Slippery slope argument.

Mandating mask wearing law requiring someone carry identification, example. Generally speaking, people right wear whatever want. speaking general health welfare, _can_ restrict someone's movement.

Basically, IMO, would easier prohibit people leaving houses without mask, require law someone wear mask public. police arresting ""bullying"" (what would say, I'm sure) wearing masks. would neigh impossible enforce.

Ridiculous, honest. no-brainer. leave home, wear fucking mask. might catch end year. Depends continues taper like been.

But never approach driving deaths terms living days stolen. even close. Bartender here. chaotic situations arise us sling drinks, asking customer, came bar drink, wear mask make many list topping situations happen. long 99.99% witness 20 people dying, it'll like tree forest never fell. Covid special olympics. US Brazil unfair advantage special ed presidents. Well, definitely agree that. Humans absorb negative positive. bad things stay minds prominently. (It helps us survive.) media always grow absorbtion bad things good things.  yeah, gov response slow lame, least destructive, that's big difference US Brazil. one mentioned political affiliation lol believe Peggy sees free spirit hahaha Testing expanded people deathbed, younger population infected lower risk supporters keep saying ""the point always flatten curve"" ignore fact 1) cases rapidly increasing areas 2) many competent societies managed control outbreaks staying lockdown long enough get infections manageable number valid firearm license forbidden wearing mask public carrying weapon.

So choose wear mask carry firearm.

By passing law requires people something prohibits carrying firearm, violating Second Amendment. Varies poll poll, lot use random calling. despite common misconceptions include cell phones.  Back peak numbers. Maybe reopening good idea? Oopsy poopsy. read one said ""Get 3% people die""

Like dude IFR actually anywhere near 3% would basically plague. Even 1% ton people Yep. applies covered entities business associates thereof explanations echo Trump administration's current positioning state Covid-19 America: denial excuses. 

DeSantis Abbott, couple P.U.T.A.s

(phallus trump's ass) **Ah shit. go again.** solution keep hospital send field hospitals. Elderly patients constantly going hospitals hospitals know manage them. states use approach far lower death rates. article excessive death talks stuff like that. Thanks Gov, right thing I, along time North Carolinian citizen, thank support you. Tell families lost someone 80 health issues. I'll know goes heavily freedom failed science class! Nobody tells wear wear it. somebody tell get haircut nails done?

/s can't tell. true, seems intresting deaths days. I’m sure target minorities aren’t wearing masks.  work Americans lol, aware known lie told didn’t want run PPE.  explains ignorance 🤣 little brother pretty severe autism. cant speak communicate, trouble keeping clothes on, can't use restroom alone etc. would definitly trouble keeping mask im sure would feel uncomfortable also probably scare him. hope brother well! Curious, steps take live? think would probably require lot lights would cost effective. Wiping things probably best. 

One possibility heard using reme halo air purifying system-can anyone shed light whether work scam? Raleigh went mask mandate 7 hours ago. missing range cases asymptomatic 'needs treated' - classify quarantine treatment. Gloves really helpful touch objects public immediate access handwashing hand sanitizer. Agreed. Well, America effective public health policy, masks. Thanks back up! 😂 don’t get ppl can’t basic research like u never ask kind questions? What’s risky? Like long 85 prbly anything. need protect elderly best that’s It’s affecting worst.....not blacks somoans Indians. Elderly....with existing health conditions. They'll blame youth going bars, restaurants, etc whilst forgetting hell opened damn places!  Bare minimum? bare minimum? Masks highly intrusive get painful alot people. mean, eat/drink/breathe mouth, you???? mention hot humid much country. Wearing mask akin wearing snowsuit beach. actually uncomfortable. saying ""bare minimum"" huge understatement takes away credibility Ah don’t live California, you? better treatment

When covid first hit, medical community near-clueless was, illness, let alone effectively treat it. That's case anymore. medical community far better understanding illness does, proceeds, measures tend successful treating it.

Part problem fixation deaths. Because, ability treat illness improved, get benefit hospitalized. covid potential debilitate victims, even they're spared death. places like Texas Arizona huge populations hospitalized illness, threatened permanent damage bodies, large segment population ignoring ""deaths gone up"". death concern here. I'm planning applying international grad programs probably fall 2021 earliest. masks talked protecting others primarily person wearing them? walking happen walk micro droplets someone else, wouldn’t wearing mask protect case? 

Why say wear masks protect yourself? means hit herd immunity superspreaders it, could occur well 70% population figure generally quoted minimum herd immunity. Yep. dating woman daughter asthma. first date arrived apartment told ""thank wearing mask"" responded response would correct: ""I'd asshole wear mask."" Herd immunity means people get virus cause already it. nothing happens someone gets virus. lol, true that. it’s even sad one women pregnant. It’s collateral damage him. value momentum press gets one rally far greater number die one event. resorting mind games get people wear masks... anyone says wear mask public:

“Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.”

― George Carlin ""It's flu"" Smoking. Banned restaurants, even outside cafe restaurants.

This pretty typical US. think ""nanny law"", misunderstood completely. purpose law protect non-smoker. non-smoker able enjoy restaurants without inhaling cigarette smoke. government care smoke destroy lungs. cares smoke near others may allergic may asthma.

Creating billions doses doesnt happen 6 months discovery. Furthermore, odds company actually finds vaccine going fine companies producing well? going bottlenecked really hard. height idiocy mask regulations considered ""controversial"" whole segments population pandemic killed half million people (so far). mind-blowingly stupid that’s just...🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️. don’t know laugh ridiculous furious reading it. see, case made alot clearer US system really bad seems.

that always say media nowadays professional reporting partial truth, sometimes none all. Look Czech Republic ...masks work friend Tennessee, please re-elect November. Even better manage elect Cal Cunningham too. Triple points state votes Biden.

My state lost cause, politically. still matter! thing is, I'm certainly fan Trump response this, however, talk politics coronavirus pretty much news politics sub, huge ones, least r/politics. 

This sub talk focused virus response relatively non-political standpoint. allowed politics talk here, sub would become mostly politics would become yet another clone subs. mention probably even US-centric. prohibition politics talk keeps place unique that's good. depends nurses union contract not. contract people, current president, view world strong vs weak lens understand complex values. hit lowest common denominator, masks need branded show strength. “Right now, data available us, appears little transmission protest events,” says. “We’re absolutely Covid's dead, Reddit get memo.

Ha ha, yeah... I've sick since Feb 15- &amp; stay home orders, I've basically seen anyone (other partner) &amp; hardly gone anywhere 4 months great! Everyone's upset able socialize &amp; heaven.  yes, must lot things public health experts contending however, US clearly adhering basic requests (masks/social distancing). point give up, call spade spade say people US won’t take seriously become infected? say, think governor’s words important. Virginia, currently North Carolina. Virginia, wearing mask felt like big deal everyone else wearing one. part North Carolina, wearing mask feels embarrassing nobody else wearing one. continue wear one exactly reasons governor stated. governor needs normalize wearing mask make people feel good so. easiest way would mask mandate, think even words helpful. South Carolina also thousand new cases today. Interesting. I've always felt rescinding laws difficult. easy guess concern moot. South Florida. wear full facemask going supermarket indoor area may go into. . Herd decimation happens nearly everyone gets sick.

yes, everyone left less immune. See good thinking! /s still pandemic? absurd. every comment thread purely political. Fuck shit, one around wearing even simple surgical masks. 

That means I’m wearing respirator. 

If one even attempting protect themselves, I?

Edit: prob say April/May wore regular mask. everyone butts nuts local bars though... I’m done protecting others I’m protecting me. could predicted this?!?!?  No, really. Thinking otherwise fantasy. property, rights, life exist continued government support things. taken without recourse arbitrarily-defined set circumstances little influence. necessarily like case, examining past current state things clear yet period (except pre-civilization) true. degree, becoming hermit migrating failed state freedom directly proportional capacity resist other's violence mitigate this, live anywhere infrastructure accept potential thing standing treated disposable property continuation rule law. New steroid treatment decreased death rate 20 25 percent I’m aware wearing mask isn’t really protecting me. It’s benefit others happen asymptomatic carrier, even then, it’s little protection I’m still handling goods people touch reason I’m (grocery store instance). 

I’m 28 home gym powerlifting cardio, keep pretty isolated outside/avoid people outside necessities like grocery shopping. much do. roommates wfh except one who’s EMT they’re people self aware enough really follow extra precautions it’s gamble regardless. OP PT clinic worked reopened May like even ppe don’t wanna come back? like fuck there’s way I’m risking exposure way screen patients let alone REAL ppe decontamination setting. I’m getting paid paycheck unemployment+fed bonus go grad school August gonna leave June anyway get choose rules enforce? Yes. lot people still think it’s hoax sort conspiracy mean, dead wrong. 


Protests absolutely spread it. outside helps air recycled, packed close negates that. Wearing facemasks protests help though. worries, we’ll agree disagree. good talking ya. “By definition structure”? According fictitious history? electoral college around since beginning.  Takes strength courage wear mask peers may sneer. Masking caring others. Caring takes strength courage. wear masks carry vials alcohol sprays.  AMC requiring masks social distance seating. CV tests also detected PEDs would zero cases testing. 🤣  That’s still haven’t looked 

Since couldn’t type in, literally first thing popped Oh, damn! made realize many journalists &amp; teams going exposed covering this. Also, heck mean CASES RESULT??? going MANY cases result. strange see Americans talk callously deaths countrymen. wear mask wanna catch anything. also wear one want spread anything. 

Nothing strong it. selfish ass. details - state South Carolina, percentage tests returning positive steadily risen 2.7% end May it’s 14% per day positive. 


So clearly isn’t tests performed. I'm 24 finished college also there's global pandemic. It’s simple, people ending precautions reveling imaginary authority figure. “I’m wearing mask it’s free country” ignoring science buying conspiracy validates want. Welcome decline USA. intelligence learning looked upon conspiracy theories fake facts rule day. define tapering off? Since May 1st we've hovering around 4k 5k deaths per day. There's tapering off. 500k 3 months. makes think 1.5 million year's end (most 9 month span).  math. rate death currently much higher driving deaths. think point going straight starving death bit stretch. think equaling going back work even theme park, instant death. also bit stretch. fact I’d say so. There’s precautions park taking Covid death sentence. won’t say it’s awesome, facts could even know. could also mild symptoms. Yes die it. Yes severe symptoms permanent damage. would say it’s gonna harder someone feed refused work therefore longer eligible UI. income; would die Covid working park. Disney’s precautions don’t work, they’ll shut again. Well like handling move Arizona Florida. Seems like better understanding things even higher elderly population. Apparently boils to. Although charitable. Frankly, believe Trump. could literally shoot people TV crowd would cheer louder. literally put t-shirt around face. Stop dramatic. Bastards. going interesting see Trump sort protection surrounding precaution not. cover outbreak facility.

...but keep hearing guys work hospitals declaring every patient covid one get $29,000 payment gub'mint! Ramen..... What's going happen team infected staff member 1 day game?

Reschedule next 14 games?

Forfeit?

Ask team ""be bro"" let play quarantined players?

What would happen Red Sox sent 14 COVID hookers Yankee's hotel floor? Gonna herd immunity time football kicks off. Wearing disposable mask would kill you. health authority introduced KF-AD (anti-droplet) masks, lighter breathable.

I know sarcasm physical work wearing N95 times may actually kill you. usually wipe outside Think way. You’re walking around touching things minding business. thinking it, rub fingers together notice hangnail. Still thinking it, bite said hangnail. 

Now, you’d touched something virus it, pretty good chance you’ve infected yourself. 

Now let’s say thing happens mask. Unthinking, notice hangnail go bite off, mask stops I’m pulled present realize there’s pandemic shouldn’t touching face. wait I’m done, car use hands hand sanitizer. bite said hangnail drive home. 

I don’t know you, I’m always touching face. wear mask, I’m constantly reminded good idea. Godspeed. Tulsa. Home Rockwell B-3. mandate 14-day quarantines suspend flights to/from Florida

Back like April, Governor applied 14-day quarantines flights coming whole states NY NJ CA WA, plus cities Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit Miami. negative person. Probably one likes you, usually tell that. mean, people want Ättestupa.  cool guess. literally job... Yeah, shit. Sounds like restaurant workers me. world going live die like us , let go , death natural Let's see proof wild claims. happening. continue spiral, promise. sorry repubs, private corporations, property rules right. hurt brain contortions. Dude stay safe stay fuck away people. Exponential growth demand reagents  probably good might well play safe. Thinking you. I'm sorry understand. hope friend call time time. wish give you. feel terrible together.  Amazonas first state get hit really hard almost two months simply started go hardcore lockdown mask use. Death rate close pandemic emergency hospital built covid shutting patients 

Some experts say that’s normal course virus less deadly contagious strain takes over. course disagree saying it’s soon something like happen. 

The first states got hit experiencing beginning flat curve others (like live) starting go up.

Edit: clarify meant hospitalization rate hospital exclusively treating covid patients. Nobody knows future, many trials medicines like malaria, aids, remdesivir. something worked??? if? could saved many lives. Think it. population 130 Cr means 3 4 Cr death months. India cannot handle that. form cure could helped. Unfortunately nothing worked far. take another month maybe India becomes like US. pray something better nothing.  patriotic brave blame vonerable group failure JOB. Wow! hospitalized? (I imagine yes know BP closely.) official counting yet, today 180.000 new infections. Covid 19 getting started. nation millions us voted candidate. walk outside buck naked. Let’s see happens. Im moving Britain Also Christian bashing. wish times like would turn science faith. take AC real serious Texas. shit, unusual store AC blasting 69° front doors propped open day.  long term. cases US less 3 months old. third study from China suggests critically ill patients; authors found 58 asymptomatic patients, 95 percent also evidence ground-glass opacities lungs. quarter individuals went develop symptoms within days.)

“These kinds tissue changes cause permanent damage,” says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, radiologist Keck School Medicine University Southern California. That’s actually great idea. 

Yea recently stocked disinfectant invested fogger clean everything shows. would think keeping pets leashes would common sense. 
  neighbours cat loves me, pissed give daily rubs loves 12 years. still comes around talk toss sticks ( he's weird) touching puts family mine risk. Common sense Unfortunately makes believers turn god even think it’s test god giving them. wife’s mother huge Christian whole crises strengthened resolve “the end times happening right front us” 

So sad. even hunker down. Hindsight 20/20 pandemics like pretty rare basically:

1. Stay outside outside home

2. Wear mask whenever possible.

3. stay house night time.

We could lot stuff still running, outdoors cities/states could plan anything, people could follow simple fucking rules. pick leaves plant keep growing - keep temps 75 though plant want bolt(seed).  
A window box inside window sunny side house would work. Put varieties relatively perpetual fresh salad mix. We're basically people drinking bleach. get burrito bowl Chipotle, transfer food new bowl unimportant? That's evil. talking him, would matter? Lol. 


He’s root problem along people (mainly followers) don’t take virus seriously. 


So yeah, might laugh situation like would someone ate goat shit. Damm dumb af They’re pretty damn good though. Nonono key add ZINC.  That’s way it! 

I’m cautiously optimistic NYC doctors still don’t understand enough. doctors looking virus angles, false negatives, long tail covid, children, asymptotic, etc. fact test results sent back caveat used diagnostic criteria. There’s much still need understand. I’m going COVID week 15, symptoms, multiple doctors agree I’ve tested negative. 

I hope people don’t get careless summer continue keep northeast going right direction. want wear simple mask ...

Don't ask anything , probably wont it. Good Well guys, looks like ""harsh"" social distancing measures able reduce 7-day moving average deaths ~600 per day. cases spiking handful states, expect number start creep back towards ~2.1k saw peak.

I really struggling see situation trickle self-reflection/modesty occur president governors states spiking refusing pull heads sand (FL, TX, AZ, NC, SC, OK) we're probably long haul. Well, work some, data quantify ’some’. exposed works lot more, someone house leading way spreading it, would seem crappy masks work aren’t risk, little are, well you’re home close quarters infected person - need additional protection cases average American isn’t getting additional protection unless it’s social distancing. also problem masks - aren’t swapping out, they’ll get contaminated you’ll breathe in, I’ve found least breathe differently - harder- particles get may getting deeper lungs. might end making sicker, faster. scientists weren’t wrong, it’s nuanced. like one even confused ""media panic""

That's hate much this. many people going Trump ""hurr media bad"", like yeah, reasons say mass media bad.

But looked JHU map, 100% numbers, fucken concerned. media there. die ones smart enough listen live. Nature merciless. things are.  Better risk inhaling virus instead. know what's healthy? Dying. That’s norm, I’d bet many dollars it’s universal across whole state. Coronavirus we'll get results much quicker. Ew. can’t interact school. work healthcare know children contract give adults. everyone NYC children. yes always fewer children contracting it, still catch spread it. hundred cases. hundred mystery illness. comment isn’t meant sound mean mad sarcastic anything. Sometimes writing something sounds like person dick wasn’t meant come way. Maybe so! Hoping not!  horrible is, suffered end long life. glad surviving spouse died soon after, live life someone long separated , death saved immense heartache 4th. Of. July.  


SMH. There's Reddit group Covid positive people share stories. Many ""recovered"" people still symptoms 90 days+ post infection.  I'm sure Fauci became sort god science sub. quotes read, clue virus anyone else, despite credentials. ""Fauci thinks"" ""Fauci says"" sort guaranteed popular here. antibody count? Try science World War II basically every war. graphs daily totals state Yeah watching government ecconomy turn that. Hey, there’s football, it’s strategic advance team immune players weirdest part is, everyone who's risk rally someone likely support him. Yes, may go infect others after, really shooting foot consider people going get infected possibly die exactly ones care enough president go rally middle pandemic.

it really amongst shortest sighted things I've ever witnessed life   Brazil's pretty clearly underreporting past days.

Their positive rate 40% like 30 days now. ALWAYS undertesting. can't keep up. everywhere, literally. assuming vaccine never made? lot companies racing deploy first effective vaccine; happens en masse, reasonable expect use masks decline. forget pays him. dumbest thing seen since Gene Ray’s Time Cube. Assuming it’s packed, it’s certainly going valuable case study see spreads packed indoor facilities. least got one. I'm still waiting.

I absolutely qualify. filed taxes end January return direct deposited beginning February account use every year. Nothing end changed. stimulus yet can't get past damn ""Payment status available"" message IRS website.

Called IRS zero help. Essentially said qualify, know received payment yet can't anything it. told show up, claim taxes NEXT YEAR I'll supposedly get then.

It's bullshit. I've Ex Norwegian cruise ship sails Sumatra Java islands Indonesia. ship even remove old signs food prices starting new role.

~Stay safe, good bro. original response made chuckle. sure explain it, reaction obviously proves good thing many subs. No...but will.

Second wave coming, mid-October. Went pick food place today. Guess what, one's wearing mask, owners customers. confronted him, like busy hot inside n all. Smh. People always say, “My vote would count lived [insert state here]!” But, again, statement predicated assumption states randomly-assigned, interchangeable collections voters.

In reality, lived North Dakota, would different set needs now. lived significant length time, would likely also develop different set values.

The said, think would fair adjust number electors assigned state proportionately reflect population. don’t think it’s good idea away electoral system. remember wailing came along smoking bans? bar industry going disappear hear people tell time. Seriously? Damned... might explain blood pressure reading 130/100 usually 119/100 most.

If case, doctor might want keep eye blood pressure. couple reasons deaths going down: know treat better early outbreak- using steroids anti-coagulants, limiting ventilators; nursing homes vulnerable people already hit; people getting treated sooner hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. would effective?

Dumb Americans one’s supporting themself working disney theme park. It’s like death vs move back home mom dad. ""It's time get wrecked

The closer get, clearer became



It Kid Rock yelling, ""What's Name!?"""" Sorry, temporarily infected Reddit2005-2020 virus. Symptoms include reading first sentence comment making assumption author’s intent, reading headline article, assuming entirety article’s content making ass oneself. Lets see many tens thousands end infected hundreds thousands people protesting sweating days upon days. Ignore 1000 lb gorilla room. Step 2: ????

Step 3: Profit doesn’t mean won’t permanent lung damage like many recover it. it’s dying it, it’s stopping spreading vulnerable people. Gaslighting abusive behavior but, usual, abuser always finds supposed justification it. like Governor Pooper imo Angela really supporting point, fact pretty much making mine China simply interested honest truthful conversation. Ya, wonder ratio though. usually show symptoms Mooch get test confirmation within two. sure many positive cases we'll see protests two Mooches, definitely helpful know. Right now, understanding outside low risk. could change that. work clinic where, 4 years asked us give masks people waiting room coughing, others would catch whatever had. 

This notion ""masks sick, protect non-sick"" around long time. 

It concerned would subjected very, sick people - gave us 1 - count 'em - 1 N95 mask. still holding like gold, sparing mask breaks. mention sterilization mask use. leaving us, apparently. bake mine. 

I glad mask-wearing finally recommended all, common surgical masks work everyone wears them, not.

 Americans refuse stubbornly, part, read academic papers, keep abreast new medical technology, even care sun solar system, unless intend go beach tan themselves. 

I considered ""egghead"" work know operate repair computers, know network basics, take interest goes environment around me. laugh technical scientific question, offer answer. ""Hah, hah! knew she'd know answer!"" ignore try discuss them, beyond answer question, cannot keep me. 

I'm scientist. am, I'd call ""scientific idiot"". love basics, beyond would rather math. - read academic scientific papers - sometimes abstracts - curiousity. 

What's wrong Americans? They've dumbed school systems, family, friends. fashionable smart lower income families. are, ""showing off"". often put like this. making $500,000 year, coworkers well, I'd better company. need elevate educational systems US, turn cave apes. still get masks become political thing. Science viruses care going vote for. personally think go direction reduce power federal government, particularly presidency. Good discussion 👍 Yeah cop comes kills someone piece shit. Went shopping first time since pandemic started yesterday. got argument group people refusing wear mask. told said stayed home. Hearing made frustrated verge tears. 

Do people get wearing mask isn’t protect *them*? gives shit get sick, don’t prick harm others. r0 1-1.5 data reopen. know, lockdowns cases plateaued, giving 1.0ish r0, that's **the only** real r0. lockdowns, places mitigation high 5.7, would lockdown levels reopen stop wearing masks? I’ve completely lost sense smell partial taste.

This common symptom. virus replicating sensory nerves mouth nose. Good luck! say risk banned sub whatever. rule can’t talk politics? Trumpism *guaranteed* escalation pandemic U.S. going forward intimately causably connectible. It’s like people pulled notion mask-wearing “political” thin air. It’s like President United States rejecting science, reason morality declare testing bad, makes “the numbers” look bad inconsequential.

He’s holding rally tomorrow. Indoors. 20,000 people. state case count growing exponentially. state’s coronavirus hotspot. 

A subreddit calling r/coronavirus disallowing critical discussion salient fact (for sake “neutrality” whatever) literal, pants-wetting insanity. nation vote all... Iowa already bill like pass get signed governor 😡 realize deaths don’t happen immediately getting virus? increase deaths seen next 3-4 weeks Meh

Fuck people telling news shit. gfs grandmom telling making paranoid told wear masks shit saying news.

I saw docs always wore masks felt like disease fucking transmitted like flu, wouldnt want protection could get? 

Common sense.

Ffs

My gf underlying illnesses makes likely die shit wasnt risking you’re 80 healthy statistics show dying virus extremely rare. Big brother watching. tell impressed yourself. Non-bright people usually are. bigger problem vote all... Yeah. lot people get married 20s know look for. pandemic? nah Fauci Adams lied they've damaged credibility. Yup I’m tangent. Sue me. :) (but reasons went tangent user replied said “American Workers” “disney workers” following line thinking)  would know didn’t even try live Iowa completely hear you. dumbass governor right stuff least done stupid stuff. However, honestly can't say exactly why, feel upheaval year going change many, many things. starting see rats jumping ship. Orange Banana's followers see bigger rats jumping ship they're going start worrying they're jumping mom, dad, baby dies Coronavirus they're going see everybody jumping jump them. Pre-post edit: Sorry writing half essay, ended way. think important elaborate discussion whole thing.

The statistics Scandinavia lie, course. I'm mostly proponent pointing fingers pandemic actually over. Two months ago one spoke Brazil Ecuador. Four months ago one spoke Sweden USA. Two four eight months now, knows countries speak then? Especially less countries decided open again.

It's fair Nordic neighbours allow Swedes (with exceptions) - reason allow inhabitants travel countries Greece, also opened people Europe (also Sweden Portugal) enter country. irregularities like that, especially tourist-heavy areas (which could seen Alps February, contributed spread quite lot seems), makes question whole lockdown strategy much good all, sort ""reset-button"".

Of course I'm hoping countries hit hard later on, real worry (especially vaccine come end year) least countries strict lockdown get hit way later year. initial lockdown surely helped countries prepare future wave, fact Sweden managed go initial wave well without overloading hospitals. remember ""Flatten curve!"" movement February (something one speaks more, ironically enough) that.

The failure, contributed high numbers, failed keep virus elderly care homes. *This Norway (among countries) truly successful*. Sweden failed - surprisingly, since there's warning clocks ringing years lack structure elderly care homes. that's rest countries little list made failed well.

[This broke news UK makes even clearer. Partly shows statistics modified - know correctly Sweden Belgium two countries reporting care home deaths thoroughy throughout whole thing - moreso shows many deaths occur outside hospitals. US states I've seen reports excess deaths skyrocketing even official Corona deaths quite low, interesting get kind data countries around world.

All all, hear ""WTF R U DOIN"" comments rather quite frustrating, personally. understand per se, sentiment ""now only"", utterly disregarding past future, quite dangerous. Critiquing countries react fair, disregard countries less retarded something dangerous. serves many things boosting national morale, quite honestly bad international liberal values long-term. go buddy? Germany, France? ""I caster nets. Tyrants emperors rise fall. Civilizations burgeon die, always casters nets. tillers soil, herders pastures. civilization begins, ends, begin again."" - Steven Erikson Jus keys, Orlando daytona. 

Tampa Bay count convo “If stopped testing right now, we’d cases, any.” wear mask 100% time public. Still getting smirks looks people. live Toronto Canada Yeah Cuomo arrogant piece shit, short memory. doesn’t really care anything generating headlines. trust Fauci. He’s cautious gives facts doesn’t speculate. 

MSM done really poor job reporting pandemic. It’s mostly alarmism. 

My go news source generally NPR this. they’ve guilty mistakes msm. 

NY Times podcast Daily pretty good. also listen covid podcasts. 

Back March started following lot epidemiologists twitter. I’d read tweet threads FLA like NYC, exponential growth would mean every major city US hospitals overrun like NYC. 

It never happened. half shit said wasn’t true didn’t happen. 

Now people saying FLA, TX, AZ go off. saying second wave coming. 

I’m highly skeptical know f*** talking about. Bro, president said something along lines - wearing mask somehow slight him.

While governors undoubtedly powerful, trump far far powerful - politically, terms voice.

We don’t want altercations potentially even violence sake masks. Better let individual restaurants bars whatnot kick people - grass roots probably works better.

The president absolutely mandating this, governors too. 100% onboard that. don’t see happening. AHS watching closely. Daily briefing today. Let's hope best. Oh way get back work.....even kills you. Well one side nominated, elected still overwhelmingly supports actual moron truly horrible person President. Oregon case 226 people infected one church. rural county prior church outbreak 24 cases. article suggests, think depends live. Northeast (NY/NJ) things certainly seem gotten better. mean, basically national epicenter period time. rest country seems getting hell lot worse. end goal deniers??

It can't anything good... clearly want many people die possible. comes another Civil War is, you’re right. proves point. Starving death bad thing. Deaths start happening go thru month long high number cases, overwhelm hospitals, even ventilators available. NY peak would 11k cases, reach numbers CA, FL, TX, that's get NY peak death tolls. median age FL 37. ""just"" get it. bloodbath everyone gets naturally, time. can't allow this, must social distance, wear masks, stop going places need go. I'm 45 pounds since first learned March obesity makes covid worse. never huge person, BMI March 33. Despite avid exerciser many years, realize much fat lost it. figured time got weight I'd almost thin still weight want gone. 

All lose eat less pretty much everything, plus strength training reps less weight (but gaining strength anyway) increasing running gradually 20 miles per week 35-40 miles per week. amazing fast weight comes take less 2000 calories per day regularly burn half run. BMI 28 keeps going lower. also motivating think everything might make difference get covid, maybe even difference life death.

The main bullet point I'm trying make work hard long enough, lose weight want lose. Ha. Go cruise subreddit. find out. people crazier Disney fans. bright. people know HIPAA is? lol Yay science! Agreed. I'm glad mandated VA beginning reopening. makes much easier people probably worn one denied service/entry places people shut started wearing them. think that's attributed new therapies sick patients. worry hospitals flooded covid19 patients, means anyone gets heart attack, car accident, would get care cause doctors slammed. think that's attributed new therapies sick patients. worry hospitals flooded covid19 patients, means anyone gets heart attack, car accident, would get care cause doctors slammed. cause death clearly pneumonia. Silly citizens. area sounds like mine! Wednesday night, Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg went Norwegian television make startling admission. Some, even most, tough measures imposed in Norway's lockdown looked like steps far. 

Is anyone friends Norway's prime minister? that's kinda article actually talking get hung one word title. it’s cons GOP what’s Gov Cooper’s excuse wearing face mask marching protesters couple weeks ago then? type people think baker shouldn’t make cake sex wedding infringes business’s rights eyes likely person wants infringe business’s right set policies protect safety employees customers. one bats eye 3NS (no shirt, shoes, service) signs particular snowflakes absolutely melt business says can’t without mask on... expecting supporters use basic logic? That's expecting waaaaaaaaaaay much Fauci Adams lied they've damaged credibility. Exactly this. world always horrible today (probably worse people) popularity internet finally seeing atrocious world capable being. doubt world get better, time, although terrible, result net positive. absolutely going major growing pains mean time. Good don’t know, death hell deterrent. talking adults fucking toddlers? seriously coddle god damn idiots instead mandating masks? fuck nonsense? people roof, bar restaurant. Seems logical really. lot people think CoVid scam (I think way) due ""Der Fuhrer"" White House telling scam. really want optimistic dont seem giving attention ""probable"" figures win ***far*** UV-C penetrate skin, nonetheless kills viruses, viruses small.

***Far*** UV-C used safely places people. think time public stop influence people. True. yet deaths decreased 2 thirds (or more) peak trough new cases remained largely range bound. recent uptick, third - that. words, deaths dropped disproportionately.

Can’t lag. Likely combination testing, better treatment, fewer hospitals approaching capacity, lower average age infection. Hospitalizations dramatically well, though obviously we’re seeing uptick handful states. know. wear mask you? forced wear mask protection? Hmm. care you? due respect.

Ummm makes kind hearted person makes world better? Wow man. Kinda sociopath sounding. isn’t going football fall. Take bank. could play “maybe if” game COVID allllllllllllllllllllllllll day. end, I’d mostly ranting testing restrictions delays.  said so!? usual, politicians eventually dragged right conclusion, kicking screaming like two-year-old child. pretty much America. People many countries believe still science ( science-believing american). Completely understand u.

I get tons hate say economic shutdown alone kill 30 millions starvation according UN, people gets mad cant understand unethical decision sacrificing millions otherwise healthy people save thousands people good health. dumb asses worst states come visit better states matter. English shockingly poor. Doesn’t Florida 4K pneumonia deaths last several years? govt lying stats, maybe? Crazy. would think would wave us live California: police enforce mask order, departments say

Even offender black? Fucking hell. people hopeless. Probably first thing I’ve disagreed on. It’s dramatic, economics political choice. economy changed several times matter days, last months haven’t proved again, it’s true February March (speaking US). 

Sorry loss. Wouldn’t think testing people symptoms people contact covid patients would yield positive results testing people without symptoms? actually give shit people pretend suits argument. another sociopath looking make money. Dime fucking dozen days unfortunately. neither you. good weekend, stay face buddy! Still overcoming shock. many idiots. sentence makes sense. mistaken, there's little difference end.

There's lots differences lie mistake, specially end, push point I'm going assume foul intentions instead assuming ignorance. Idk thought hear people saw oh cheap tickets fake virus rushed line get angry anti-maskers. ah, science wrong said 80% would ok. sure, keep believing bubble Good DJ (hilarious, look up) shitty person singer. dude case county Montana 60 days! opened up, 8 evidence community spread. ZERO fucks given social distancing. median death age...is .04% makes sense matter many times repeat it. seriously needs celebrity PR effort around especially would influential populations wearing masks. Yea fly Covid idiots? Ugh. skip vacation Sanibel March. may wish death, based experiences ""recovered"" 90 days counting pretty horrific symptoms. One friends live streamed DC literally counting masks. 30% people would take constitutional amendment remove it. Use brain figure that's done. yes does. study shows median death age 70s covid 0.04%. else say considering snowbirds AZ, it’s gonna shitshow well let's wait see hypothesis right. 

if courage, one goes 10k strong crowd people chanting screaming try get go back home decrease risk covid low fatality rate. 

the american public media basically moved away covid coverage. longer main focus people already become mentally exhausted it. stopped reading articles, clicking links, caring. 

the fact care. care. know get sick, probably wont half percent people die, develop immunity it.

and want reddit keyboard jockey typing away stuff, anything except mental masturbation. careful, public might come year Qatar two (well, three, 3rd important this) main groups population, native Qataris wealthy live comfortable lives, migrant labor. migrant labor mainly jobs one wants like cleaning toilets, construction, etc., imported India/Pakistan/Philippines basically treated like slaves paid enough make worthwhile laborers get send money home. migrant labor largely young healthy men, native Qataris ages, two populations rarely meet possible spreading like wildfire within migrant labor population amongst Qataris. Looking legal advice/info: ONTARIO, CANADA. living mother cancer therefore high risk. workplace lot people coming daily. worried getting sick infecting mother, risking health life. HR says need either come work immediately (after ended temporary layoff) need resign. said take leave absence. help/advice? go grocery store, everyone wearing mask except handful people. look like idiots. Put mask! make sense. No, actually didn't. leaves bad case credibility. Love it! Ugly af, still, love it. They're scientific organization. Scientists wait they're pretty sure something true declare true. Science lagging indicator. person decides take action truth fully known person charge government area live in. Jesus. Pretty sure takes longer months obese. brain neoliberalism everyone. Take long hard look cause going suffer massively people think way. without people spending money useless trash ultimately destroys environment need sustain life die from? would love hear answer.

I mean possibly sort issue using opportunity continue giving trillions dollars ultra wealthy using said funds reorganize economy away killing us what's left resources. even make sense. think report saw said 11 players tested positive AZ. Granted, lots players come many teams. anybody's guess, I'm sure handful coyotes players.

I wonder decided go enjoy Scottsdale night life.... point, 911 work more. own. New study shows median death age among people age 70 infected COVID-19 0.04% applause resounds low effort thing do. can't believe much trouble people causing vocal opposing it. Just...wear...the ... mask. Well, know, 3 months ago government saying strong people wear face masks compassion health care workers needed work normal people.

So rhetoric emotional manipulation changing. 

Wouldn't nice live world could state facts behave intelligently? instead, need emotionaly manipulative appeals get people follow idiotic leaders change messages monthly basis. one said we've downgraded, made lot progress right direction. completely agree, given current state everything would probably work generalised picture (like many phones rally long) due privacy laws USA, doubt legally reveal entity who's phone precisely where, even physical data available outside particular circumstances (not sure besides serious crimes). circumstances would serious enough US cellular provider turn subscriber location/time/date information? course would consider crowding sans masks &amp; distancing pandemic going serious enough. one tourism. NZ everything else, unlike almost everyone else. problem. way talk situation makes many think i’m conspiracy theorist ‘Grandma killer’ actually I’m presenting facts don’t get shown counter narrative  Yeah refuse asshole service, dignity worth $10 hour. feel attacked? ridiculous headline. really thought Americans racist? Oh, sweet summer child! risk get serious infection small! Womp womp.........my county going green next friday still make sense. Could rewrite title supposed communicate complete sentence? wasn’t fuck feelings crowd? 

we drop illusion people ever argue good faith. see many people bashing Sweden coronavirus response. US better? US even imposed actual lockdown? Get shit together put effort, get EU levels. we've pretended 3 weeks. shouldn’t mass gatherings right now. Regardless cause.

Are serious? referring Black Lives Matter protests, looking level detail beyond overall number US provides little evidence case. appear correlation states extensive protests states showing increasing positive cases. example, Minnesota epicenter protests steady decline cases.

It's unquestionable protests extent increase spread coronavirus, evidence appears suggest early reopening poor adherence social distancing/mask wearing much substantial factors causing uptick cases described post. Florida man crazy weird much stupid. Agreed. Mask Showing - $10
Non Mask Showing - $20 Wouldn’t ok tho, aren’t masks ok wear outside? Seems like park setting bubble would safe. Seriously asking  HAZMAT suits also save lives.. let's mandate too! Agreed 100% r/Masks4All  Average means mean (at least American math). again, mean would want use here. Using median incorrect.

As example this, median chance dying COVID 0.  Legitimately, sensory processing disorders, always autism related, probably people actual, severe claustrophobia. Like full panic attacks cannot stop effects daily life level claustrophobia, disliking masks they're touching face. Awwww, look super tough internet man bitches something 95 year old grandpa do, lol. Therefore lockdowns etc etc work?

What source? dipshits live kind thing. Act like entitled asshole cry they’re victim. already posted Reposts removed Close states down. Masks mandatory, jailled. Right police continue focus killing/arresting #BIPOC!!! Unfortunately, due Sheriffs elected, ending popularity advertising contest (I remember story random guy got ""elected"", simply one ran), end percentage simply good platform, skills, passion, ethics hold responsibility. Kinda crazy think it. Honest question.... evidence/risk COVID spread protests... shut small businesses use proper precautions?

 I'm sure find way protect risk people virus well keep businesses functioning, no? need revolution I've lived Nebraska 40+ years. rationalize Ricketts fault using talking points like fake media, false science even Bill Gates Hillary behind it. People blind reality. Clearly president thinking. reducing vote base, making come events. They're gonna protected second wave.. least.. Sci-fi plot commences... needed proof Fauci scientist, get load claiming ""science truth"" recent HHS recording. Sorry Fauci, science truth, never never be. Clearly even understand either word means. Mask wearing eating $15 buckets popcorn gallon sized soda don’t go well together. Hence initially winked away mask usage fucking cock. excess mortality give perfect number accurate indicator pick quick analysis

If looking US CDC excess death numbers far accurate. whole lot guesstimation going there. Fuck people. time.

This pandemic brought lot really shitty sloppy science, Santa Clara antibody studies hcq redacted nightmare

That shouldn’t undo majority Science, foolish approach every publication absolute fact

There way many missteps resulted scientific leaders (including fauci himself) speaking absolute fact things later reversed course long wear gloves, use sanitizer, wipe everything bring home, wipe surfaces hotel, fine. Wear mask, wear visor. airborne virus per say. said, emergency would stay home take unnecessary risks. I'm NYC cases continuing decrease. know anything Australia. mortalities C-19 follow pattern everywhere across world regardless measures taken - strict lockdowns without seen exact pattern: death rate hits level peaks, declines steadily. debatable effect lockdowns all. 

As see countries come lockdown, noticable changes pattern. expected 'second wave' simply happened. 

For intents purposes, appears managable, seasonal respiratory disease. little suggest anything that. Means covid cases longer traced back single person.

Like Beijing, trace back fish market; Korea traced back night club. 

In USA, everywhere. increases hospitalizations?  Damn right! fucking shameful little compassion many people have.

Only months ago jackasses attributing COVID deaths comorbidity, saying deceased ""already death's doorstep."" compassion... gloating American, would feel safer China tbh... agree sitting movie theater isn’t calling name, since wear mask day work also wear class I’m taking, that’s big deal. think need get used them, they’ll around awhile, I’m sure. remember first harder wear - barely notice it. hopefully that’s norm others - kind acclimate them. Okay? understand point, I'm pretty sure that's cause one. We're also densely populated state US, managed get virus minimal levels. wear masks indoors governor looks science first. lock helped. Stopping visitors nursing homes helped. course, first two months pandemic hurted us lot. 

Now, R number one. 

Our theme/amusement parks last things open well indoor dining. Drive-thru ""anything"" become trend here. Outdoor dining stay next couple months. 

Keep up, Jersey! 👍 Hopefully, join New Zealand soon. issue we'll probably build wall and/or quarantine visitors. Tough we're peninsula though. 😂  Mask wearing eating $15 buckets popcorn don’t go together. Hence initially winked away mask usage Hard nyc! Man. old employers head office there. I’m happy never go head office.  Saying mask mandate denying liberty like saying law denies liberty. people refuse wear mask biggest proponents ""LAW ORDER"", one it? Yep. They're insistent others fear mongers, yet they're first make blatant, incorrect, opinionated statements, yelling world end this, economy explode solely reason shutdown two, panic driven beliefs.

Yet, everyone responsible, course they're little worried, mainly go lives, trying prove whatever everyone, focusing important things. pretty clear take step back who's emotionally invested, general, panicking overall situation.  Wearing homemade one myself. Hopefully job isolated benefit want WWII style ""be patriot--wear mask"" campaign. Hell, get Chris Evans Captain America one time make over-the-top old-time patriotism. cant taking victory laps. 800 infections still lot infections take effect multiplying nature that. Soon 800 turns thousands. Yeah, vast majority employees aren’t planes time much less interaction public. would like know percentage active flight attendants got infected.  economy continue tank virus suppressed cure/vaccine. people understand that? Cut ties. relationship worth potential permanent lung damage. virus went arrogant spolied people? would something. appreciate it, frustrating haha Yeah guys keep telling that. also BLM protest Melbourne, majority people wearing masks. 40 new cases whereas prior protest, single digit cases. Dont give anyone ideas MAGA Cruise! Thoughts prayers.... thoughts prayers... saying bar really captures trashy vibe? could save many lives. face shield?  pay 8K deductible something similar, never comprehensive health insurance separate 'emergency' insurance plan cover 8K deductible like 

Lmao Exactly! Like greasy flatulence trapped gaudy suit ? thought read saying that. Pretty incredible really. least know stand Aren’t expected hold steady according “experts” wrong already several times covid. 

Deaths going likely continue so. Thank you! Happy early birthday  Kind like protests or? paint face orange? think that's huge false equivalency. Individual versus population level. Obviously positive test result isnt reason testing positive virus reason pregnancy. increase number ""chances"" positive result, necessarily be.

Another key difference pregnancies reported eventually reach actual number population whereas never true virus. 99% pregnancies come term. Way less 99% virus cases ever get yo point undeniable necessarily reported.

Therefore always lag reported cases versus actual. increade testing within lag appear surge totally possible cases stagnated even DECREASED

Not saying that's what's happening important recognize data artifacts making key policy decisions based Honestly, much pop culture based around strong heroes wearing masks protect people don’t even understand poorly received. Masks cool!   People orange spray tans. Arnie American, too.

You aren’t good analogies, you?

Washington Arnie born countries, became American later. able become President. know topic, everytime see name pop up, think ""JUSTICE TUVIX!"" (even though apparently killed family). eating? Boiled cabbage side spinach?

Don’t wear masks! It’s worst thing etc. need go state move apartment. Likely around people. need stay two weeks? Get tested? sneeze...FFS.

This case. I’ve never said open everything up. don’t (haven’t yet) seen spike protests (I’m UK POV), believe masks driving factor, could well be, don’t open outdoor gatherings make face coverings mandatory? protestors packed together, can’t packed together things enjoy? Mandate face coverings people come don’t, it’s important show people progress made. It’s weird virus, it’s suddenly bit less contagious less deadly looks it. comparing individual countries largely size states country five times population several times area again.

Now compare number deaths EU USA adjusted (much lower).

Compare number deaths Europe USA adjusted (even lower again).

Compare New York UK.

Compare Maryland Belgium.

Etc. comparing apples oranges. wuss amzing song: It’s Fox News blowing bullshit 24/7. Propaganda fucked things people’s minds.   understand US New York-led Americans reached first peak went accompanied 3000 deaths per day. Florida/Texas-led Americans reach second peak 'only' 750 deaths per day. healthcare states much better New York give reporting them? even see comments missing something? Imagine many customers got infected 500 employees. law suits it. public outrage?

Pointing gun - remember thing unloaded gun - door picture silly , unresponsible , stupid . Guns meant toys . Oh god, that's obvious! feel stupid thinking it. really missed boat. Sorta sounds like another pulmonary embolism point I'd happy data. ""cleared"" feel now? couple friends got it. Governor: increase cases alarming.

The governor's intellect, hand, alarming. think meant 'smart' far, stupid ass people think otherwise. else come ridiculous ""gotcha"" ideas like claiming HIPAA excuse wear mask, recent one, buying Asthma bracelets Amazon. much piece shit lie medical condition.... appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* actually getting quite worse us (we've broken records nearly every day week roughly 20% day-over-day growth cases highest test positivity rate ever) get point. 

The sad part science indicates much good simply wearing masks mitigating crowd numbers people southern US literally decided they're done anything stop it. totally get point people lockdowns people acting irresponsible way almost comically bad. 

An informed middle ground would helped economy medical recovery rate. People understand encouraging virus go rampant going devastating economic results anyways. 

It's like stuck human Petri dishes one side doomsday Sayers concerned conscientious humans need. o/ AOG well 6 months ago numbers would've horrific. 

Hunger Games could happen tomorrow August we'd favorite tributes subs ""FunniestDeaths"". Maybe switched due AC issues spreading virus (guessing) study “Among people &lt;70 years old, **infection fatality rates ranged 0.00% 0.26% median 0.05% (corrected, 0.00-0.23% median 0.04%)**. studies done pandemic epicenters studies done locations modest death burden also suggested lower infection fatality rates.”

Emphasis mine. title kind weird stats doesnt lie.

Instead playing role playing, could cleverly deduce people need quarantined desire old people others preconditions put risk.

That would better model applying restrictions part population risk. correct, yes opinion important fact greater publics health. 

/s .04% means 4 10000. one 2500. think think 1st include unofficial cases might know based upon title, MLB spring training sites either AZ FL. fact got sick 😷 pointed yet another post horrendous study got downvoted hell it. public know look data, also don’t want learn. There's lots differences lie mistake,

Not end user. result regardless motivation. point. think mean ""is handling"" well, long ways go still plague, people wore elaborate outfits looking like birds, frankincense kinds stuff beak. People today refuse wear cloth...

I'm ready bring back plague doctor outfits. anyone else wants join, start club.  Oh good! 31k new cases. Ever tried counting 1-31,000? would probably take day. that's many people got sick, got tested. ONE day! agree this, I’m trying gauge majority people think masks work. Since I’m downvoted asking unbiased question citing recent academic article, clearly isn’t good sub discussion. Ridiculous also expected leftists. guy say idiots cannot? Keep mind there's already ton evidence states data handled suppressed, president says numbers would certainly decrease testing we're stopped. Yes. scared COVID point. course that, also, nobody knows going happen next year. predict lot people going quit. I'm really sick tired seeing people talk herd immunity without actually understanding concept entails. awful idea that's backed research. focus herd immunity.

Herd Immunity idea population indirectly protected either there's vaccination that's introduced improve person's immune response virus (this either permanent annual), enough people build immune response. reach depending threshold required virus. Sometimes varies 30% low-end 90+% high-end depending significant virus is. researchers theorized, one example says coronavirus requires herd immunity threshold 60% based equation: 1 – (1/R0), R0 equals 2.5. time, difficult completely nail R0 reduced government/health sector gets good enough grasp reduce community transmission.

The problem 1) there's vaccine moment. Full stop. may may vaccine within next years, means potential risk re-infections. 2) cannot reasonably rely immune response simply know: a) long immune response last (if all). Research papers place working flawed research designs. better consistent grasp immune response works long, makes herd immunity nonviable plan. 

And b) much variability people's response virus researchers know why. means play around people's lives order reach theoretical threshold herd immunity. means risking death, future health implications majority people reach herd immunity may may disappear time. also means overloading hospitals. idea herd immunity without overloading hospitals nonsensical, herd immunity requires high threshold people getting immunity infection.

TL;DR - words, nowhere near herd immunity, completely unrealistic goal vaccine developed proven work. Researchers said unrealistic goal. Doctors said unrealistic goal. getting point think issue become politicized rather looking facts. efficient way reaching herd immunity vaccination. Well head anti-mask guy tweeted Americans wear masks “to signal disapproval” him. it’s freedom thing loyalty thing. It’s absolutely ridiculous. mean, he's actually considerate masked people grocery store masks 100%. us strict wuhan style lockdown things bad. already case studies. people forget cruise ships casinos? sunk cost fallacy story keeps getting trot sounds bad, details alleged data manipulation actually bad. policy describes exactly would report data. care _new_ cases, _on given day_, percentage tests reported today account new cases. care _people_ infected, number tests positive divided total number.

I think fired based know story, always two sides, side describe something objectively immoral. Yeah, would think airplanes could hotspots infections haven’t heard report shows that, makes wonder why. right, there's arbitrary line 18 level wisdom able demonstrate.

The arbitrary line 18 level wisdom **expected** able demonstrate. Welcome adulthood. edgy Also random question since Florida thread, username related I-4?

Looks like pair of... can't understand what's happening here. We're middle large Second wave yet keep opening everything. even restrictions left (masks, distance etc) enforced.
Israel responded initial wave extremely well early restrictions quarantines, contact tracing, lockdowns seems like entire leadership given up.
On bright side hospitalization rate low second wave maybe virus ""lost"" strength summer (vitamin d) mutations, knows... Americans lied COVID-19, expect.
 Masks work. Masks work. Masks work! Everyone needs masks!

COVID-19 spread protests! COVID-19 spreads rallies!

What expect happen American public? It’s mandated restaurant seated outside (then take eat, course), come inside use restroom. far, every single adult kind, understanding, conscientious.

I there, pay rent, need work. Caring enough servers (or checkout person grocery store, gas station attendant) basically say “fuck you, think masks silly don’t care risk person close you, get sick I’m asymptomatic” **adult** **functioning member society** looks like. well open hospital beds.

👍  worry, hoax stop Trump getting reelected

/s ded competent leadership Washington FAA would step make requirement airlines flying U.S airspace require masks everyone plane. Individual HCW: say patient mild symptoms might COVID, I’ll test, it’ll pain ass, taking lot extra time resources without actually changing medical decision making. Patient still go home get better (probably). 

Administration: COVID screening treatment taking massive amount resources manage safely, every time another positive admitted spooks everyone. numbers keep going up, may stop elective procedures again, make money. fumble COVID case contamination spreads, one want come anything. send scared patients mild symptoms home rest without testing, avoid wasting resources, keep numbers low, keep “business usual” going include lucrative elective procedures surgeries, avoid spooking employees patients alike. Life better low low numbers.

County Public Health: don’t keep numbers low, boss gonna pissed might close businesses again. again, aren’t detecting isolating cases quickly, they’ll spread. Catch 22.

Local/State Government: Fuck you, get positive cases. didn’t see them, don’t exist, we’re opening large conventions weekend.

Federal Government: See above

Irresponsible Patient: feel sick. bad, might COVID, need parents watch kids week go work. Fuck; shouldn’t gone birthday party last weekend. Karen told go, didn’t listen. feel worse tomorrow, maybe I’ll go get tested - good luck mom dad. Hope don’t die watching kids me. 

Responsible Patient: feel sick. bad though. don’t *think* it’s COVID, could be, even though wearing mask whenever *had* go washed hands like crazy. feel much worse, I’ll *call* doctor (or county public health) arrange testing, don’t want go clinic/ER unless I’m feeling short breath something. then, I’ll sure strictly self-isolate whole family. going mom dad watch kids, I’ll call sick work keep home - can’t elderly parents catching whatever is, even it’s *not* COVID. safe week two.

See works together promote underestimation cases? really like responsible patients. They’re like silent heroes. God bless ‘em.

FYI hospitals make peanuts kinds cases. Maybe long ICU stays cost million dollars month, get fat insurance check, every one thousand non-urgent patients “responsible patient” doing. It’s also hard explain effect COVID cases staff resource consumption. fuck whole work flow, spook staff, spread paranoia lingers weeks - major intangible impact work flow system capacity.

Edit: feel free save/copy/paste help explain others numbers likely underestimated. Encourage “responsible patient”. know public health officials, tell “thank service”.  whole everything gone right lives. wonder doctors journalists bother follow cases result rally. love people changed meaning democracy majority leadership ""mob mentality"". Majority said wear masks, wear mask. End conversation. Nope. pretty easily wear oxygen mask time. n95 construct airflow good bit normal surgical mask isn’t restrictive air flow. person asked, trouble wearing mask similar reason. hours, skin around ears torn heal like four weeks. may related eczema I'd face recently, I'm sure.

Now wear balaclava instead, point face skin way different body skin. course they're going to.

If every business someone test positive advertised it, would endless collapse one business another public completely stopped going months.

This would pretty well fuck everything. oh man need pull pants bs getting knee deep woman. asthma bad doubt would out. idiots like keep spreading covid. bf diagnosed w covid flu. fun time. wear masks, wash hands. anything statement ageist, racist sexist moved across country work right pandemic started living alone 3 months. Anxiety ups downs thing along thought control. Finally friend come visit one night moderate-heavy drinking started crying couldn’t stop. Completely uncharacteristic idk feel like deep I’ve suppressing lot lately. Christ, statement weak. least cheer death human race honestly. mean dont necessarily agree hes could said riots let's keep things perspective. call tantrum activism based side align Glad hear serves purpose. Fauci forgetting mention important thing. wasn’t March/April asymptomatic transmission long presymptomatic periods recognized actual (and surprising) behaviors virus. Prior that, research (based influenza-like-illnesses) shows basic masks don’t prevent wearer getting sick - flu doesn’t lot asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission. research show masks prevent transmission sick person. evidence didn’t support wearing masks seemingly healthy people, assuming novel coronavirus acted like influenza. people transmitting feeling sick, makes sense everybody wear mask.

You find evidence asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission became compelling around time policy mask-wearing changed. reddit hate athletes much. Posts like seethe jealousy. you’re troll. BBB masks would 🔥 Shut Fauci! testing capacity yet pulling daily numbers. 30-40k highs while.

Note mean virus can't spread 30-40k people day. virus going show good sportsmanship wait testing catch up... Honestly, understand (not respect) this. you’re willing leave house all, never accept food directly delivery person driver, never fill gas tank pass someone hallway, guest. Discomfort trumps selflessness, right? I'm 30s, work retail. working nearby location 3 weeks strip mall since malls still closed. Luckily, busy us 35 baffled watching people walk by, I'd say 50% masks 50% maybe 30-40 50. get People heads asses? Where’d get number Corporate Profit Public Health 🤦‍♂️ Really comes every citizen America part try stop spread. What’s scary people seem caring anymore act like virus gone they’re done lockdown virus. Would Ebola started spreading states? It’s scary thought. work live theater industry we’re still definitely shut foreseeable future California, I’ve put thought this. 

This one option could work appease sides patron base, especially fogger. 

And clear, I’m pro-masks believe work, there’s question that. usually leave Honeywell kn95 dash truck day.. triple digit temps it. week tend get rid depending use long sun  Well. There’s part also fact we’re likely going kill thousand teachers process. isn’t going popular opinion, schools bit like prisons infrastructure standpoint. Lots people crammed together, ton outdoor time, lots recycled air. Prisons fare well, suspect colder months take hold, neither schools. 

And note: Bucks County PA, recommendation parents take child’s temperature every morning. schools told so, since parents handle it. 
How many high school parents honestly think going this? No, 'easier said done' Hitler could stopped years became problem arresting one numerous crimes committed 'ascended' high government authority keeping locked prison rest life. Mind you, he's also stopping local governments anything pandemic either. states probably get really bad mid July. depends cases continue track. can't believe would continue grow current pace. better two, imo. part state in? based comment guess metro area. Probably lake minnetonka - eden prairie, chanhassen part. Nothing neat it, that's scary. I'll assume death rate lower since probably lot undiagnosed cases make feel better. we're find week 2 US dumb fucks.... link info that? true hes massive douchebag pining attention. dude flipped flopped many times hard tell people ignoring following old advice. Since bot clearly hates truth is:

Both sides stupid enough get infected. sides deserve consequences. welcome it. Apparently severe asthma makes mask difficult wear extended periods provide evidence “that almost certainly happened” opinion certainly disregarded? Yup. I've struggling masks awhile sensory sensitivies, finally found one like works. :)   Really thanks man! appreciate comment

Saludos vecino, ojalá por esos lares las cosas estén yendo mejor que aquí, aprecio realmente tu comentario lol who? wanted? ""herd immunity? oh... thought said 'heard immunity'. That's said 'no'."" millions people protesting rioting. Nope, single case that. people blindly acquiesce authorities. hope people die. wonder happy opened beaches fast??

Anyone wanna go club Mismi tonight? If, however, positivity rate increases testing increases, bad. IF, case Florida Texas, positivity rate increasing higher rate increases testing rate, even worse.

That would true *only* random testing.

But weekend say ""You know hear real Covid problem X, Y, Z .... lets get test places"", would expect high positivity rate that. whalecum even consider Fauci doctor, consider administrative bureaucrat medical degree 4 decades ago, seen patient since. Fauci admitted misled public people thread STILL trying gaslight us old excuses like wErEnT sUrE yEt. like 248 know airborne, obviously droplet spread concern. point, virus everywhere pretty much. I'm healthcare back hospital come July 1st, really matter much. exposed point eventually probably already extent, needed travel pandemic. I'm pretty sure literally anything better nothing, assuming cases people assholes try careful. Yeah “medical condition” thing flies ailment qualifies ADA. despite idiots best efforts, it’s illegal airlines ask is. HIPAA applies insurance companies providers. canceled Businesses started going under, increased pressure business owners You’re trying argue point doesn’t exist. You’re using facts, you’re arguing semantics it’s hilarious, it’ll never hold anywhere matters. Sorry. underestimated stupidity told us masks don’t help all, expect suddenly tell us important. Good luck getting data. Feel like lot people go rally get sick gonna forthcoming fact went rally. sounds like took page trump's playbook Good American Airlines! still dancing around it. Come on, it? Yeah, general, celebrities disappearing crisis could using platforms promote mask wearing. Instead, radio silence general.  Half shit passed science social distancing going disappear.

Plus surely vaccine effective treatment Agreed, herd immunity almost impossible hit along fact immune system exposed creates safety period 2 3 months. could go wrong. Good luck guys surprised going this. stupid even him, though double method kind knows guess shouldn’t surprised... needs every vote get, it’s likely people rally it, spread others screeching USA-USA. give families, friends, many probably share political beliefs. 

It’s sad really, mean lot people polar opposites beliefs, don’t suspect would like them, Trump really leading slaughter one. don’t wish coronavirus anyone, including fucking idiots. yes, interested seeing case load Tulsa 2 weeks this. It’s police decide laws don’t like. Goddamn jackasses. ""Activist"" guy gun who’s running cops can’t stop get away go kill someone night.. really wish would’ve taken threat huh even getting re-elected. rally Oklahoma gonna get re-elected.

This Trump feeling bad he's 10 points back polls, rally cheer up. predict behind plexiglass screen industrial fans blowing air behind towards crowds. 

No matter what, irresponsible put people risk stroke ego. would go determining was? I'm still hearing comments like ""they'd 10 15 years left"" ""Most nursing homes going die anyway"". I'm sure genuine. There's lot people trying sow disorder spread misinformation around here, people really seem little broken cruel Follow money, you’ll see controls things, also afraid of. ...which shop online, safe? Brazil show world basically uncontrolled outbreak looks like. Maybe southern US too. tfw gaslighting defeated actual admission Fauci misled public. Right. Thanks Karen. Motivational Papa Trump don’t wear one! *Dollar dollar bill y'all*

Get money politics FFS. 

I think could really fuck again, America finds way. Cmon Tübingen! even heard trial live road there. Got everything crossed Less lethal taser kill... running away less lethal lethal weapon threat self public allows happen justly police chiefs snidely say things like ""we're mask police"" quite literally need mask police - that's occurred countries handled problem I'm sure they're allocating money police military USA. Fuckin' r/Masks4All Unless they’re selling concessions also plan come checks movie, going trust fellow movie-goers leave masks properly dark. I’m sure find way nose chin. another chain near moved seats far apart - can’t even sit family. guess it’s movies home us on. Nothing ruins good movie people talking theater, often luck, guess it’s fine. feel bad businesses, though. Autistic people is. us breathe fine mask. lot us hate it, anyways... almost like generally significant difference. not? going magically disappear. Seat belts primarily help person wearing it

Except go flying cabin injure everyone else car you.  motorcycle helmets another one, even kids bikes accept safety 😔😔 Lol...and exactly ""true science"" would differ plain ol' ""science""? Hahahah.... C'mon now. social distancing thing stay. Keys?  found guy who's parents hated fact abort. Always good big imagination 1,492 total deaths reported April 18 around 149,200 gives us 333,100 cases April 18. means total slightly less doubled since then.

Hey numbers doubled span one comment, impressive.

So 300 000 600 000 two months.

While first 300 000 took what? month? 

I think need chat graphs seem less truthful. death numbers coming prisoners (which essentially none ""nursing care residents"" account huge portion deaths elsewhere) really worrisome. 

The prison houses 2600 inmates, 13 (0.5%) died. going 0.5% non-nursing-home population die fail contain? Who's complaining? know young infants may able breathe properly. kind obstructory condition?  guy paid troll, activist. California Nazis tight. There's gonna gnarly tan lines I'm pretty sure remove NYC true. Exactly. need lie Karen dies. goal response pandemic extermination bad advice. Places like China Korea manage way tests hours turnaround joke? Florida last week see single non-employee mask tough days really nothing else id rather doing. done job 12 years still love it! wish carers facilities homes forgotten underpaid. still fight get PPE I'm lucky I'm one carers earns real living wage, I'm trying buy much can. 

I wish idiot uk government would admit there's PPE stop changing guidelines make look like binbag, gloves surgical mask effective protection covid-19. stupid - tell us working with.at least go work knowing face without false sense security today's updated PPE lists! Theoretically scientists could get names email addresses everyone attendance. 'could be' follow questionnaires even calls... 

In lieu least hope guys tracked phones spring breakers Florida, subsequent dispersal, track guys. tell us something know! I? Negative? Dude brand incestuously inbred cancerous cringecrack u smokin? rant happened towards black person ebola outbreak got posted ebola subreddit I'll 2 million% bet fucking life worst fucking enemy fucking balls even write single fucking word ur original fucking comment!! makes us asians fucking different, huh?!

“YOuR LogIc dOEsN’t ExiSt”

Boy bye One father's co-workers friend personal trainer NYC. died COVID-19. fit guarantee live. interesting question. deadly contagious disease need justify lockdown? 0.1% flu enough. 0.5-1% COVID is. Somewhere line.  There's host long-term serious health implications affect recovered covid patients. Even putting aside deaths, going herd immunity strategy saying ""yeah let's voluntarily give lifelong respiratory problems population"".

Do kind numbers showing common long-term effects are? true science truth. Holy Schnikes!!! work figure out?!?! Wait they're still using tests week turnaround?  Also “the death rate 0.0005%” Plus virus causes lung issues induces coughing... take MD hazard guess wear masks find hard evidence virus *not* spread respiratory droplets. guy. loved beginning. message seems confusing. day seems like he’s saying something stark contrast something he’s said day two prior. Kinda odd, trust knows way us redditors, time seems super inconsistent. Lol searched build-up exercises lot diff articles/videos you’re interested. [Here’s guess internet broke love echo chamber much educate yourself. Typical left. Man, certainly wouldn’t choose live resort style golf course. envy other’s lives, together. Sounds like gratitude :) It’ll both. politicized sides. true. used open-minded this. shown true colors US. legitimately look folk. Sorry mate look like absolute fucking idiots. disagree this. Take seat belts example. Back 50s / 60s afterthought.  kind unheard drive without wearing one. matter social norms, take time take hold.

Highest number since 1 May. asked thanked different person. acted like prick reason hate break better two weeks ago according numbers proved elsewhere thread. Better good better. Sorry seems upset you. like less people dying getting sick. offense sort completely missing point

the guy could worded better, saying public nudity disallowed makes people uncomfortable bit reductive, point someone pants (in vacuum) somehow unsafe

it's unhelpful bring things like sexual assaults conversation like this; yes, legitimately huge problems, makes seem like ignoring point hand talk something utterly unrelated (and someone agree topic, generally great way irritate them, turn often lead likely listen shitheads) fourteen day letting mask rest lets virus die according study. Unfortunately desperate hospitals 5 days. article quicker method institutional use. week link elastic bands fail x uses. Oh. play differently crowd OK. It’s going really interesting couple weeks after.  

I don’t get finial part attendees. doctor said needed something, quit some, I’d get second opinion. looking future so. Soooo, go party everyone blowing death air?  worry them, arguably good parents, sons, daughters. astonished playing out. lack world works? Ignoring science ignoring latest data pandemic. 

Case point. New Zealand. People go academia comfortable; incompetence abounds.  Part every movie review also theater review, whether chain management part protect staff customers. me, basically saying stuff anybody see looking news. would higher, willing give freedom safety. Government force businesses shut down, force people wear masks, etc. role government. worry, last long. Deaths notoriously lagging indicator, meanwhile week US went back early May numbers daily infections. Anyone trending hospitalization data found deaths, feel like hospitalizations better leading indicator vs deaths.  cases Singapore, think 95%, young migrant workers. Probably case Qatar well. Well, old people die. Yesterday blaming migrant farm workers. wonder get blame Monday? Yep. mentioned even made first decision *delay* sports, simply happen, sports coming back significant manner awhile. amount people completely disagreed surprising, understand. take precautions, players, know, people like, get sick. get sick, even they're healthy, still possible might permanent issues after. happens teams lose one three best players due long term lung, neurological problems? happens coach cannot recover fully, retire? doubt fans actually want happen, want risk favorite team suffering losses, despite that, everyone willing ignore science, ignore we've seen places, risk health, lives?

It's shame even question risk worth it, let alone they're still trying make something happen. dude said they're anxious, suicidal, struggling right now. saying deserve gold star manners, please try take consideration. could positive influence keeps someone killing themself! Nobody really knows. probably fine, that's still 25 people breathing recycled air extended period time. gonna suck Tuscaloosa, home Crimson Tide. 

Im worried. sister brother law live T-Town. Sorry. following comment? clearer. asked link thanked them. great data. Alright. total deaths April 18 (Lets use official number) ~=200000.

How correct people dying median 18 days catching Covid-19? 

Obviously noone dies Covid-19 day catch it.  mean sound snarky dismissive. lost job permanently live NYC health care savings, I'm fucked anyone. However, say, shitty leadership thoroughly given jobs. entirely separate crisis, along civil rights protests. fucked economy too, resolved months :( According polls, Americans reached time low happiness. Consumer spending rebound years possibly, may well save lives process. bills wait. Maybe I'll look one bankruptcy things president fond of! Yup No, chose go ""factual land"" proving assertion wrong using official statistics.

The number deaths average mortality. That's fact. actually 3.3% higher number still go total number deaths week still certain.

Now, instead making stupid accusations ""conspiracy land"", actually try prove wrong? campaign promised ""the total complete shutdown Muslims entering United Staes."" even mused creating registry Muslims country campaign.

Since promise wildly illegal, modify message get courts, original intent crystal fucking hospitals get overwhelmed it’s usually middle aged die old. dying, still ending hospital, comission home, weeks even 2 months. people holding economy. People late 30s definitely 40-50 need elective surgeries, colonoscopies, prophylactic early intervention medical procedures etc. can’t pandemic spreading uncontrolled. people getting treatment need impact economy. Even completely ignoring deaths 65+, since honestly net loss economy, still going economic loss worse effective lockdown couple months. pipe dream, basically NM right now... confusing title. seriously scary quote. 😬 Rooting you, dude. Maybe allergies? upstate terrible pollen. Like Americans thinks school shootings price gladly pay ""human right"" buy assault gun reason think cool. maybe Never actually said good job making things junior. thank this... live sac county totally forgotten video. fucking funny  proving data, weird decided act like prick. Nope AMC stands Actively Metasticizing Corona.... actually trust vaccine rolled 🙈 get wrong super super pro-vaccine, rush inject something body rushed every safety trial. sister mom pro-vax healthcare professionals share concerns. Vaccines take years roll monitor test subjects *long-term* side-effects. cannot rushed. counter question argument would be...is hospital utiziliation covid patients going up..if is...it's testing. new spike cases. holy fuck, equating ""I like rednecks"" ""you hate foreign cultures"" laughable continue normal healthy develop immunity.

Good luck that. Every sign far says virus much different nearest relatives whose antibodies present months catch virus again. There's evidence magical permanent immunity. can't even say people catch second time less likely serve cases. could easily rolling dice every single time catch virus nothing hopes prayers long term disability death outcome. 

That even take account fact spreading virus like wildfire makes likely new strains develop antibodies might effective even still them. 

The ""develop immunity"" plan stupid fuck we've time research even may prove feasible. key points:

&amp;#x200B;

* wearing mask, exhaled viruses able escape concentrate nasal passages, enter olfactory nerves travel brain. 
Russell Blaylock, MD 
* scientific support use face mask, recent careful examination literature, 17 best studies analyzed, concluded that, “ None studies established conclusive relationship mask/respirator use protection influenza infection.”1   Keep mind, studies done demonstrate either cloth mask N95 mask effect transmission COVID-19 virus. recommendations, therefore, based studies influenza virus transmission. And, seen, conclusive evidence efficiency controlling flu virus transmission.
* importance findings drop oxygen levels (hypoxia) associated impairment immunity. Studies shown hypoxia inhibit type main immune cells used fight viral infections called CD4+ T-lymphocyte. occurs hypoxia increases level compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), inhibits T-lymphocytes stimulates powerful immune inhibitor cell called Tregs. . sets stage contracting infection, including COVID-19 making consequences infection much graver. essence, mask may well put increased risk infections so, much worse outcome.5,6,7 mostly common sense. virus spreads respiratory droplets produced infected person coughs, sneezes talks. infected people wear mask, they'll severely reduce spread virus. Since many people asymptomatic, know virus doesn't. wear mask, spread virus lowered dramatically.

I'll certainly listen/read data contradicts this, everything I've seen (including link posted) studies whether mask protects person wearing mask. main reason wear them. CDC never said that. part PowerPoint leaked explanation data. 3k worst case scenario. Bazillons Brazilians You’re right. say don’t dumb ass. dumb ass. Sorry threw little ad hominem argument. You’re exactly great defending argument though. you’re arguing called name. we’re sticking whole conversation, took turn implied wouldn’t want people know sick. gross lack empathy towards others may gotten sick. proof develop immunity COVID

Totally...aside [actual scientific studies issue, [effective vaccines coronaviruses used vets nearly two presence antibodies human patients fought covid...

There’s plenty evidence develop maintain immunity covid. nonsense we’re never going able overcome covid sensationalized bullshit. Please stop spreading around. Maybe get educated try speak maybe insult knowledge subjects versed in. 

Or keep running mouth like teenager. ever works you. say that? No, didn't. simply correcting u/Vedrops facts are. 

Instead misrepresenting/mischaracterizing said making assumptions insinuations learn exchange/offer/inquire goal constructive discourse. Otherwise, hostility expose fragile ego yours. [Until start going 371 confirmed infections 197 active cases, Coronel become one communities affected coronavirus Biobío Region. However, according mayor, Boris Chamorro, day sanitary residence neighbors, despite fact making request since beginning June.

Brazil. Hospitals collapsed, least (Sao Paulo). continue trend, hit maximum capacity public hospitals soon. Right around 70% city. happy thousand deaths day like happy shitting floor instead pants. improvement, there's long way go, given rise cases going start going back going get somewhere happy long long time.

But good sign measures got death rate low today working well. city goes way enforce parking, I'm pretty sure they're amped hand out. :(  Yes guess right. Maybe health care system collapsed rather hospital think big thing you’d never really notice: poor people voice dying refused hospital care won’t make news maybe even registered covid related. may already happening now, knows January shitshow took place, I’d believe Trump would re-elected. come November facing flu + corona pandemic/racial tensions still simmering/millions stay unemployed, many fence blue-collar workers disgruntled vote him. wait second. 3/7/20 Trump said ""Anybody wants test get test."" that's it. I'm willing listen stop cryptic appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Grimes Point Archaeological Site Fallon. *coffin dancers start dressing up* Remember CDC said would 3,000 deaths day June 1st? Looks like sub long-term memory wasn't. sometimes wonder types people stupid miss clear flaws argument (deaths lagging indicator spike cases increased positivity percentage testing unambiguously bad) bad faith arguments made clear political agenda. Hes sharing reasonable information though America didn’t exist George Washington born, I’m sure make clear. expect leader-less country 35 years cultivated personal prospects? Like wtf understanding here

He born land later deemed America. never accepted British domain. founded America. American, matter try argue it. wrong cuz idiots struggle think large picture wise. Ppl care inconvenience protecting public health fucking global pandemic. even comprehend death toll efforts taken worldwide stop thing? Florida; diseased dong America! arguing way do, holy cow get saying, think. 

I stand fact conspiracies theories bandied still less substance cult. Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, alt right asshole, make baseless shit. Antifa coming burn house down? That's baseless conspiracy theory gotten people hurt. Migrant caravans full ms13 isis? They're borders according conspiracy theorists. Jade Helm, Hydroxychloroquine, climate change hoax, women's bodies get pregnant rape. baseless bullshit put keep conspiracy theorists riled up. 

So sure, teach kids think critically question government. facts remain conspiracy theorists lunatics reminded reason separate dangerous people rest society. 

The idea everything bad done boogeyman according sinister plan distracts blatant nature current administrations criminality. continue distract future administrations history. long dangle deep state bullshit, 30% country eats up, hook line sinker.

I mean, critical thinking comes to. know rest nation Texas, GOP specifically removed phrase ""critical thinking"" board education's lesson plans because, 'it causes youth question pastor parents'

So yeah, conspiracy there. plain old bad governance. bunch yokels hyped conspiracy theories, racism hatred see government selling river. number, like 14K reported China one day, due backlogs publicly counting cases. Brazil's pretty clearly underreporting past days. sub wiki covers right masks buy use proper take care use them? eat vegetables, honey. help grow big strong. forget, I'm sure people stay home watch right? means people, like here, get-togethers, cook-outs, parties watch together. Simply put, lot people everywhere care, simply *feel* normal again, that's matters, right? China Italy? Great. Yup No, maybe should? Fox News working outcome 10 yrs Well, read full article instead fear porn headline, they'll also read this: disease appears control Italy, average dozen deaths per day reduced number infections. Oh... bad, misunderstood question...

The reported total number deaths April 18 multiplied 100 rounded up. actual number would 149,200. Like said earlier, perfect vector kill Americans, large 0 long term memory think all..
Believe far worse narrative believe.
Wake up
Masks social distancing effect is
Wake said “ don’t dump ass” start crude. insulting badly continuing spew profanity reason make look cool!!! 

Grow up, conversation clearly over. Cases rising past two weeks states. would surprised deaths didn’t increase. Cool. give us poor story comes one family. man/woman look grandparents/parents eye say "" Earth chosen good riddance tanking economy anyway"" lol roughly month Alaska since reopened life pretty back pre covid. Bars weekend, gym days, basketball times week. Right we're averaging 10-20 new cases day. Well saw protests country middle pandemic NY,NJ, Connecticut way down. fact still massively concerning. care deaths Texas, FL, Cali, Arizona NC/SC guess we're good??!?! shows anti-education sentiment probably find US. countries world, developed developing, treasures education. US kids good grades get bullied school. fundamental education average American students pretty poor. compare SAT math countries college entrance exam Russia China India. like elementray student homework.

The scientific mindset logical thinking average American poor. Americans chose leader like Trump turn complicated issues appear binary, black white, wins argument showing evidence proper pipeline reasoning, personal attacks. 

For people without scientific thinking politic fanatics, everything clear right wrong, left right slogan, thus political. see make masks political. high numbers medicated numbers. good day. also condition called [Wolff Parkinson condition randomly ramps heart rate around 180 whenever decides stop go ER.

COVID-19 coronavirus.
Coronaviruses discovered 90 years ago.
SARS also coronavirus. 17 years ago. MERS 9 years later. Researchers justifiably planning inevitable developing interstitial components extensible modular system. Would rather weren't?

As industry, develop backbone systems going production.

It's saying? 

That's disingenuous low-effort attempt strawman logical fallacy. misinterpreting said, reframing statement incorrectly. Everyone going infected eventually. shut go hospitals time prepare. moving forward. Yeah equalize things bit, also makes already generous assumption protests drop police killings African Americans 0 Covid deaths continue rise become even generous. 

Now protests solve racial inequality police misconduct whole, Covid-19 cases, deaths compare apples apples, stay locked now, again, far case. Either hospitalizations, total man-hours recovery time (average recovery time multiplied # cases) would good stand-in quality-of-life losses due Covid. 

You're also operating false dichotomy: Protest exact way currently carried out, never protest this. responsible socially distanced protests parts world Covid related issues Israeli protests PMs power grab. protests could done later time rather time coronavirus cases rather high. opportunity cost delaying protest would lives enhanced saved period would taken place (May26-current) vs future period minus coronavirus cases could prevented delay.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand probably good unbiased estimates many things, think important understand agree upon objective framework discussion. open safer. Masks distancing help. Sure show many experiments papers virus ways. super extreme either way tend thrown later. wear mask public stay away me. I'll same. public private group well enforce bad choice strangers. I’m point thinking stupid people won’t wear masks, maybe they’ll die corona less worry about. know wearing mask makes worse everyone else stop thinking like that.   first person get covid vaccine it? I'm pretty sure Oxford vaccine first one injected people disagree comment “purely political” see dynamic Florida right now. Cases exploding 20-50 demographic, hospitalizations creeping up. 

Some people might think that’s good, it’s absolutely terrible :(. means virus spreading control. It’s clear despite everything that’s happened people still **don’t understand exponents**. forgot put /S end tinfoil hat rant. Putin charge..whatever number doubt. suspected suffering Covid-19 admitted ICU Maharao Bhim Singh (MBS) Hospital June 13. test report, however, came negative later. could look number hospitalisations across country, clearly shows uptick last week so. consequence expanded testing. Problem is, relax lockdown NY/NJ future low cases, neighbour states still plenty cases. Unless close borders, it'll creep back in.

The world shown need geographical isolation keep cases zero manage eradicate. Think China, NZ, Aus (soon), etc. wlever ban interstate travel US? not, COVID situation NJ/NY good neighbours situation is. Across entire population yes, amongst young healthy people risks dying hospitalized close ZERO. can't learn metric system order change countries sorry there's people want deserve you. 🤷‍♂️ Obviously government controls guns. monopoly legal use force. think focus red pilling people principles liberty instead black pilling status slave - what's acceptable masses mind.

Science dictates younger people less cellular DNA damage [longer telomeres/aka aging clock cells]. Age-related conditions increase COVID-19 morbidity mortality. Muh masculinity says I'm insecure perceived weak way they'll learn affects personally. they'll keep going like everything normal. wear mask get one ANSI rating. someone caught Covid, I'm 100% unaffected it. True, worried numbers keep increasing every single day pretty mucy. would think number new cases would level off, start decline, testing treatments take hold, happening. nope, you’re one wrote non-related rant comment. 

I agree general sentiment, btw. weird tack particular comment. Yeah also vaccinations decrease effectiveness time. 

Basically idea whether get herd immunity COVID, pointing think science yet either. anecdotal experience see area. Granted go often, trying limit exposure public. worry HIPAA there, way anyone identify talking here.

People infected quarantined home still require treatment. They'll given medications help combat symptoms virus like anticoagulants, bronchodilators, pain killers, antibiotics. Even though sitting hospital condition still monitored, they'll still see doctors regularly, get xrays, ultrasounds, blood work throughout recovery last months. meat plants nursing homes. think he's worried catching Covid. think anxiety stems lockdown isolation mental health.

Despite news business usual. Also true. Next weeks telling fall going look like. Whatever makes feel better.  Per minute one cares that. They're interested big scary numbers. 7 day average constant downward trend since May 30th pretty steady downward trend since peak April 18th. Thank you, lab rats.

No way. want hair flying head crowd. Trump would stupid understand care cancer “curable”. Sterilization would bonus could stop pay abortions. suspect hasn’t yet wouldn’t able keep secret. Sadly, much now. Even close businesses again, protests continue. We're long (and deadly) haul. Even mostly carried New York. top 3 populated states rising they've started reopen going make much worse. Lockdown causes excess deaths every single major illness category, I'm afraid: Sweden, elevated Covid numbers, one lowest total all-cause mortality rates 20 years.

Lockdown scythed population like grim reaper. Yea people realize initial lockdowns happened late, re-opening everything re-set clock. 

Things opened early May, treat like February. Mid-June looking like Mid-March did. 

Late June July look like late March/April did. know, people started die. Except worse. three weeks protests already accomplished this? people incredibly greedy short sighted. Staying power important protecting people quick question. haven’t outside without car 3 months, live city US. plan go without car soon. know benefits masks, gloves beneficial ? using both? using mask washing/sanitizing hands much possible? Hey Buddy! tell stop prognosticating full keep d00min'! Warning: read comments article. What's more? 450,000 covid deaths 3 months 3 months auto accidents world wide (1.4 million ÷ 4). Also covid deaths world wide tapering off.

Covid easily kill year driving. Even majority deaths April 1st onward. Remember summer northern hemisphere 2nd wave still likely possible uptick coming fall.

Edit :. actually made mistake. 450k covid deaths less 3 months world wide still June ten days left go.

Do know R SARS-COV2 stands Ight, AA go-to choice. question direct relation comments death saying see increase since lag. seeing increase month ago?  mean people attending Trump rally Tuesday wear masks? suggests otherwise. Sweden one lowest all-cause mortality totals two decades. Telling right soothing, especially one else it. AbOlIsH tHeM! Yes agree Exactly! tons referenceable science available early proving masks reduce virus spread. (I’m general)

They lied supply chain jacked up. used supposed science back lies.  lmao China responsible Trump one stood them. Imagine world never consume anything propaganda, would seem plausible. like God, thank Trump good things accept judgement bad things times come Step 1: Denial Oh... forgot nonsense minute. reasonable concern immunosuppressive drug could hinder body's ability fight COVID. know body's cytokine storm biggest risk makes sense use immunosuppressive drug. Maybe smile eyes more. fatalities every major category.

**Indiscriminate lockdown scythed population like grim reaper.**

Meanwhile, Sweden reported third-lowest run all-cause mortality 20 years. State troopers exist NC shh Hello fellow used Pentecostal. Assemblies God. one gets infected even go huge numbers

Outdoor transmission basically non-existent, majority protesters wearing masks risk basically 0. 

Look NY's numbers believe me. We've like 3 straight weeks protests every single day, numbers keep dropping. hell tell don’t mean it? plenty preventable things cause death. thinking those? talking mourning every single death circumstances?

And obviously would care someone know. That’s completely logical. It’s don’t care deaths sure I’m gonna besides wear mask distance. do.

It's cuz Karen Chad. 80 100 still pretty normal heart rate, way harmful. honest, going emergency room 4 times still normal heart rate really quite excessive. shortness breath, feeling really ill, can't eat walk something sure go ER, going heart rate 80 suspect reason say answers trying reassure emergency.

During pretty much infection, heart rate increase. literally one criteria lets doctor know could potential infection.

Literally  Im original poster. responded reporting low numbers initially, revising upwards later one paying attention?

Sounds like Conspiracy Land me. I’m finally starting see people Greenville mask wearing, still run mill idiots either 1. Think hoax 2. Don’t think old enough get cause harm. 🙄Too little, late.  Huh? earth feeling real spiteful sudden? sort incredible missing point smugly rude right, said would gone April weather warms up... used think MIL also logical person, also believes George Floyd’s death fake government operation incite riots... soooo think logic left building lol. Certainly. respect religious philosophical differences. don’t respect violating scientifically-backed restrictions put place temporarily public safety. Media silent arbitrary milestone temporarily acheived. 

They also failed report 72-day streak getting dump 9 a.m. article posted say ""Because USA desperate situation, Centers Disease Control recommended public wear homemade cloth masks. essentially done effort try reduce community transmission, especially people may perceive symptomatic, rather protect wearer, although evidence scant.""

I totally agree common sense wear mask close people indoors. However, sources read say coronavirus particles small enough penetrate masks anyway virtually impossible spread outside walking past someone. really well. Especially surge experienced. Whitmer awesome. Stay safe cackalacky Hmm, we’ll impregnate men tests stats. Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Glendale, Peoria, several cities metro area? recall?  That's second wave crap starting news. riots dieing down, keep viewership clickbait world First off, yes wait enact ""don't murder"" long time. took thousands thousands years written Bible. still many hundreds years later added English common law. factually wrong. Second, never said ""murder good"". yes, post absolutely strawman. absurd strawman, ignored it, mean condone murder...

I always wear seatbelt. mean agree law. wear seatbelt substantially decreases risk death great harm.

I also wear mask, however, believe wearing high chance saving personal harm. chances death caronavirus like 1% (or under) unless old sick begin with. Also wearing mask provides little self protection. benefit others (which reason ever put mask all). However, 99.999% people wash discard masks use. EVERY outing, need wash, discard mask becomes useless, even makes far likely get spread covid. Since almost every single person wearing mask, improperly, basically makes wearing masks moot. perfect world scenario, masks great. reality, especially culture (which filthy), near useless. factor CDC stated covid spread easily surfaces asymptomatic people spread it, adds uselessness wearing mask actual benefit. Wearing masks virtue signal real deterrent spreading covid. completely agree wearing masks, wish like Asian countries sick people wear masks public. really respect that. However, wearing masks without symptoms pointless.

Mandating people wear masks times beyond pale anything reasonable; absolutely refuse. already forced wear mask 8 hours day physical work. guarantee 100% (yes 100%) people agree mandating masks, work. (Maybe excluding people healthcare, working home). go outside, 8 hours work wearing mask. Bet cant it. every day. also really bad allergies basically cant breath nose, making even worse. take breaks, remove mask minutes, fucking pass out. *STILL* wear mask despite this. say, must wear mask threaten use state fucking murder it, fuck you, that's ends. cant even get side this, know far wrong, longer know right is. baddies.

Also, Yes. government, penalty death prison, said mandated get vaccine (especially something like covid/flu), would also it. post literally political Money. Institutions higher education train employ leading medical professionals US,I’m assuming telling leadership good idea simply can’t afford listen. bring students campus week two won’t refund tuition send everyone home “care” safety. 

If decide online students arrive many likely withdraw, they’ll refund. 

Its still shocking nonetheless. literally cannot believe campuses like Penn State like yes let’s bring back 40,000 students campus middle PA small town hospital. knowledge right disposal somehow still want believe won’t deal sick students. Unreal. 

Truthfully schools look elite Harvard yet announce plans I’m sure schools follow lead. Harvard also one of,if first send everyone home. 2 really hot states yet people think going die summer lol. Probably dead hot damn thats scary next week

Makes sense. Anyone find something house tie around face get real mask. decided mandate masks, wait? ""None cases caused hospitalizations, asymptomatic, added.""

Between number prisoners asymptomatic, interesting think that's maybe virus widespread think. However, also performed 300 tests 28 came back positive Stop using douchebag’s name. He’s get 15 minutes. one resonates close me. inherited movie theatre father passed January slated open next week. 

I live predominantly red county requiring face masks would definitely cost business, opposite end would lose sleep night knowing hadn’t done part enforcing masks stopping spread. 

Tl;dr idk wtf I’m going requiring face masks. what’s WHO

“""there currently evidence wearing mask (whether medical types) healthy persons wider community setting, including universal community masking, prevent infection respiratory viruses, including COVID-19."" Tanzania cured thru prayer weeks ago God hope so. Target made announcement like ""due recent mandate guests must wear mask continue shopping store"". gives hope. ""Conservative"" too. again, people calling conservative much conserving. Stop saying name. He’s press.  Close, 95% virus killed 6 minutes. know viral load needed ensure infection. could've tutored, someone basically hold hand throughout process. Like said, I've seen tons people pass tests, even ""hands on"" stuff, university, forget half it, got complacent, practice, stick learning testing actively working. 

Like said, graduate mean going good job. mean remember everything, able apply years later. I've personally seen people graduate problem great grades, who, professional environment, completely fail basic tasks solely responsibility. know elderly cancer patient underwent chemotherapy went asymptomatically... getting numbers? 2%?

Spot 100% mean Surgeon General anyone grabbed yet?  think president would describe covfefe.  Dont say conservative idiots. Brazil campeão mundial de Coronavirus 🇧🇷🇧🇷🏆

USA vai morder poeira kkkkkkkkkkk one though. live 4 kilometers there, it’s bit worrying honest, well before. right, like... like there's enough wild shit going could report rather making shit lol Yeah it’s low now, we’ll see month since whole state back open. live NY too. area doubled since Memorial Day. none things.

It's still hard call. gym essential mental health. working home mental health definitely suffered.

I think likely I'll try wait month see things go. Walking everyday seeing people know getting pump struggle home going hell though. u link trolley problem  agree good idea wear even there's chance helps, seems like everyone convinced definitely help. Here's conclusion article linked: ""In Australia New Zealand currently, questionable benefits arguably justify health‐care staff wearing surgical masks treating low‐risk patients may impede normal caring relationship patients, parents staff. counsel practice, least present."" 

This Pediatric division Australia's College Physicians even think worth health-care staff wear masks treating low-risk patients. You’d surprised. Many people already think so. *huge* backlash seatbelts first federally mandated. can't possibly hard business call HIPAA excuse bullshit, right? Surely someone actually tried bring lawsuit said business, it'd become known court lying &amp; actual diagnosis doctor.  Winning! Best luck!!! also happy bday next week :) Given many people near Cleveland tested positive Wave 1 tested older people people literally death beds, would imagine we’d million cases maybe northeast Ohio alone sauce? reassurance you, UK locked march took end April cases start dropping. takes cases lower start tends consistent.

 We've gone 1k+ deaths day 150 ish weekdays 30-40 weekends. We're woods means show lockdowns work light end tunnel. Good luck man. Trains making comeback, baby! Florida fucked hard beginning, back April, everyone said “they’re fucked” get fucked hid well get lucky? PTSD traumatic event including strangulation asphyxiation along lines. Nice Show proof. That's true all. US gov: Reopen country, it’ll fine. thing go away summer anyways. 

Coronavirus: Hold beer. agree... first explain shit moron White House. work restaurant even though put quite restrictions new rules/regulations place, first shift back realized insanely soon re-open. cannot risk getting sick, environment clear peoples dirty plates put silverware mouths, it’s simply safe regardless precautions take. top that, even though mask rules (the guests don’t wear masks eat close someone without mask) employees supposed wear masks times. Guess what? employees push mask neck soon get away guests “too hot uncomfortable” - wear mask entire shift let tell - it’s bad. 

On side. One guests older people really surprised me..are lazy don’t know cook? don’t care get others sick, specifically workers? Nope live educated area local supermarket bars require masks don’t put bullshit. Correct I’m wrong, okay, testing increasing course number confirmed cases too. However PERCENTAGE confirmed cases compared number tests given also increasing, virus indeed spreading faster rate...  sure alone hating it... Fauci admits lying us mad people ignore him. saying reason why, sure hell doesn’t help. Doubtful average age positive cases nearly cut half. Younger people tend less severe cases looking back chain events. Look actual data, look dates actual significant events, see lag REPORTING data longer get sick 5 days get test day 6 see trackers day 8.

You postulate want based reports incubation times testing result times, stating see historical data available us. Plenty people hide them. people poor understanding risk. I've seen tons threads people misrepresenting, obscuring falsifying data. General strikes work work quickly. talking Trump? care humanity selfish?  That's mostly made average date I've read Reddit/the news/friends family across country. 

In area last week things opened non Frontline/hospitalized patients, June 8th 9th, definitely may 1 everywhere welcome back world film critics... try living 8-10 hours day office building recirculating air county, today refused force people wear masks. reminiscent ""if get corona, get corona""  still early make conclusion. attended Denver protests 5/30 following Tuesday. organizers made sure talk pandemic masks safe. 70-80% us wearing masks. I'm hopeful wearing masks outdoors prevented major surge. Hoping proven right next 1-2 months. remember spreading outside China dumbass declare pandemic longest time Guess who’s getting free Fed money bailouts???? 

AA! like Fauci responsible lot this. Telling people wear masks huge mistake. Destroyed lot credibility, fueled ""no mask"" nonsense. hard walk back.  case europe tiny circumsion rate maybe 4%, would far higher hiv rates compared say america around 58% rate (and dropping). case america higher rates hiv. numbers dont lie.

correlation equal casuality. reason certain parts world religious rite, populations practice less sexual partners due religion strict adherance marriage , decrease infection numbers probaly less negliable. determining factor always many sexual partners without protection. aids thing pushed circumcision crowd.

example hiv rate sweden 0.20% , usa 0.30%( taken wikipedia) yet sweden circumsion rate less 1% compared usa 58%.

also african countries highest hiv continents high circumcision rates, take south africa example 44% circumsion rate staggering 18% hiv rate. anything evidence points likely catch circumcised holding onto archaic religious rites often go hand hand outdated religious practises using condoms Yeah people really blow original mask suggestion proportion. Even back saying want make sure healthcare workers enough, shortages quickly became huge problem.  someone born raised NYC NYC whole crisis, absolutely disgusted De Blasio Cuomo. don’t try say but...but... Florida! epic failures. **Foxnews** sacrifice better step children, economy, racial equality future massive contribution. virus savior. death step towards better future! University South Carolina reported 24 players testing positive. rivalry continues 😳 disagree implied politics, for-profit media subject type control. FoxNews biggest, notorious, pretty far one side. CNN honestly bad, least display integrity, promoting lies blatantly harmful health safety mass viewers (like fox is). end day, get paid advertisers large corporations, views overwhelm everything else.  NONE trusted anymore tv preacher supermarket tabloid rag.

Yeah solution identify root cause (and think hit nail head). get defenders root cause STFU. (or least allow open honest debate). bold action (because that's take). Locker room, aerosol. I'm curious, lie?   mean got like 2.7k states work. We’ll see high next batch states gets. Hopefully much lower Honestly point nuke US. Nobody even gives fuck anymore... April 22nd officially day testing expanded people 18+ state Florida. also samples werewolves London. Might well call pro-corona activist.

Done. live DC, seen person inside building without mask since April. crowded streets, around 80% wear mask, less crowded residential streets, maybe 40-60% wear masks. Fair. end seen think. Usa failing badly. Ok, we've got facial reconstruction, autism, facial burns... that, can't wear mask? depends virus mutates. Since viruses minds they’re dumb. wouldn’t kill host knowing they’d die too. That's Americans chronically stupid. Can't wait move another country. Yes, $4 per hour figure correct, quite compare $22 per hour workers US paid.

Foxconn workers work 160-240 hours per month get paid 3,500-5,500 RMB ($500-785 USD)

But nothing slavery.

1, people free join resignation, forced relationship, people earn money work, right also guaranteed law.

2, stated above, Chinese law requires companies purchase medical, pension, unemployment, industrial commercial, maternity insurance employees.

3, average wage Shenzhen 2020 5,200 RMB (that's 724 per month), Foxconn workers' average wage close. Foxconn's workers bachelor's degree, getting salary level pretty normal.

4, course, price food China also low, example, rice, main staple food China, normal selling price supermarkets 500g. / $0.28.

5, fact, still big gap China United States terms Engel coefficient. Economist published list Engel coefficients 22 countries around world 2017, US lowest Engel coefficient, per capita Spend $43 per week food drink, 7% income; UK per capita weekly food drink consumption US, 7% income 9%. China spends $9 per capita per week food beverages, 21% per capita income (this foreign statistic, Chinese statistical statistics) (The figure 2019 28.2). country's average household Engel coefficient 60 per cent poverty; 50-60 per cent subsistence; 40-50 per cent modest prosperity. 30%-40% relatively rich; 20%-30% affluent; less 20% extremely rich. China still far United States.

6. Slavery system slave owner owns slaves. labor activity must slave-based, unpaid, without personal freedom.

Conclusion: income level ordinary Chinese people still decades even hundred years away United States, determined level social development. , earning less $4 hour proves country whole still poor, say China's low income slavery, allow Agreed. Chinese business owners personal freedom employees, China relatively wealthy Engel coefficient 30-40%, many countries world lower Engel coefficients China.

If think I'm wrong, please come argument well arguments people said China slavery, thank you. non-mask viewings fill entire theater airborne virus, sounds like great plan. considerate enough jump get good laugh retardation unfolds sweet deeply cherished friend giving chuckle fucker ink prime example times turned garbage paper dont think president knows herd immunity herd immunity strategy.

One potato. Two potato, three potato, four. 

Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more... underrated comment 2020 folks need careful R misleading cases low.

Lazio (the region Rome is) increasing numbers last 2 days got 9 new daily cases.

Lazio: 18 cases 2 days, population 6 millions
Lombardy: 390 cases 2 days, population 10 millions.

According R lombardy performing better cases decreasing... hate sub. good news?  Obviously. vaccine comes someone decides don’t want introduce body? what? cant kill every business there. Im never wearing sucks. therfore since stay home dont spend money. Easy understand. Nothing response. Thanks though symptomatic? don’t see people sitting allowing cut hair she’s coughing lung. know I’d like, I’m good. I’ll deal hair. symptomatic wearing mask it’s rare spread it, cough still spread masks really stop distance droplets spread. Good, cunt That's fair point. Possibly part US remain locked due lack welfare system place that's required lockdown, well. 

It's sad, hopefully pull soon. Good luck man! renegotiate lease. worth exploring.   Leigh Dundas disbarred California Bar evil stunts pulls- publicly doxxed Health Director Orange County, giving address. literally reason Dr. Quick got death threats. wish someone would sue evil ass. 

And Peggy Hall- special kind moron. Yeah that’s thinking too. Deaths hospitalizations lag tests usually confirmed. change title (sub rules). title different actually wrong. He’s fun play golf with, also sorta asshole. time it’s bi-partisan effort. According Professor Tamara Konetzka, recently testified Senate issue, no. profit v. non-profit owner structure bearing likelihood COVID-19 infections - likelihood infection transmission (36%). meaningful relationship found, though slight uptick facilities purely financed Medicaid.

Here transcript Senate testimony:  think Brazil taken lead stupidity capacity 20k.

whew lad know getting hospitalized 40 tail case still sounds pretty bad. 3/100 odds like. that's though. know still relatively low risk. still WAY early talk success. still early stages. 

The thing we've demonstrated lockdowns end spikes. Ending lockdowns starts spikes.  maybe we've demonstrated (via South Korea) outbreaks tightly controlled substitute harsh lockdown measures rigorous testing tracing. (which America absolutely do). 

My biggest fear anti-science spreaders beginning well. 2 weeks short. person replying noted first wave crests delays initial concerns. reason delay don’t really see 1, 10, even 25 cases right away. numbers aren’t significant really register right scale it’s multiplying wild bit unrecognized. 10 people got sick took care stayed isolated aren’t issue. It’s 1 doesn’t know gives 2 don’t know give 4, 8, 16, 32 know couple super spreader events outbreak shows state’s stats clearly. takes while. Even longer note awareness better people really careful. Thank you! breathtaking! US tons cities dominated slums overcrowding. healthcare system far expensive people still far superior Brazil offers. 1925 total deaths April 18 \~200000

No, 1,492 total deaths reported April 18 around 149,200 correct people dying median 18 days catching Covid-19?

Also, account fact total number deaths reported April 18 actually lower total due lag death reporting? Based current numbers, actual number people died April 18 1,925.

Here came with. use currently reported total number deaths (so 1,925 April 18) calculate total number cases 18 days earlier (so 192,500 March 31). gives us 333,100 cases April 18. means total slightly less doubled since then.

[Here looks ""flattening"" see middle May onward, much due lag reporting deaths. 

# Fauci says Americans ignoring science amid coronavirus pandemic

Well wonder who's responsible that... Masks symbol submission media fueled fear mongering. relief turn 65 US, medicare kicks in. Think people poor insurance insurance. lot people get outrageous bills. Lockdown absolutely works go hard enough burn out. 

Only one designed person per household allowed go food medicine every days, cars, travel. 

Massive case management testing people locked down.

It works, China Europe proof that.  think compassionate wear one contract COVID-19. can't ignore imperative kill name good longer. 

With death voluntarily feeding body economy, justice black people tearing major shitholes children rebuild gigantic trade hubs job centers! 

I think anything compassionate removing gene pool! effective lockdown couple months.

I agree everything wrote. Believe preaching choir. make points **we effective lockdown.** Now, even optimistic disease modelers think get cases US South Korea levels manage testing track trace only. problem pursue effective lockdown start. can't even get people wear masks, think they'll respond, point, complete lockdowns? 

I hear you. Every option absolutely awful. People die. Businesses go under. Children fall behind school. rich get richer wealth gap classes ripped open.

At certain point, shit creek infection going away *didn't* lock down. limited window eliminate virus, limited window resources public support effective lockdown. I'd argue passed point quite ago terms overall spread, funds supply support, public sentiment. we're waiting scientists save us vaccine great therapy. say scientist working therapies COVID-19. like given lot thought.

It's lockdown better option, missed opportunity it. even lockdown try right time, enough people listen vain. worst worlds. approaches managing overall disease level keep absolute catastrophe happening, states trying various levels. coincidence literally every state country trying reopen. absolutely necessary point. want reference think responsible opening, Massachusetts actually done good job. would change quite bit approach still, good I've seen far. ""Fatalities expected increase Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina Utah, according CDC.

Health officials report 2.2 million cases virus U.S. nearly 119,000 deaths."" government can’t even get second stimulus bill through, people still eat.

Then need complain government failing provide disaster relief middle global pandemic vote anyone refuses so. governments job make sure people still able meet basic needs crisis. pay taxes reason. government refuses provide services we've paying for, need start holding accountable failure. probably mean people vote favorite team election day though. Meanwhile comments led comments deleted mods. Alone are... alone ethics. Typical. Ya know? American ignorance personal opinion good well-known respected scientific knowledge... yeah!! CDC guidelines basically allow say fuck anyone refuses comply COVID-19 safety procedures, taking precedence ADA. stated (more politely) notice Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agreed Office Civil Rights branch US Department Health. See: ""tough shit fake medical condition, get mask leave"". safety rest plane complied compromised juvenile feelings dipshit thinks wearing mask violating rights. lot Dumbass Ignorant people post

Don't worry, China use vaccine internally first. worry country pummeled coronavirus 

All fun playing with, choking due to, COVID-19 😂😂  Maybe near zero risk death, lot reports long term lung damage survivors. know personally 20-something student athlete rough three months bad lung problems places..its pretty contained Europe What? responded already. want say something twice? seems case LatinAmerica. Unfortunately high portion workers cant stay home even lockdown measures mainly 3 factors: high portion workers manual jobs cant done home, high portion workers arent registered (informal work) related 3rd factor, poor social security networks aid people need.
Not countries region face problems wouldnt generalize usually things limit ability make strict lockdowns work like EU. Italian strain faster-spreading. (California mix strains, anyway, since Italian strain faster-spreading it'll likely come dominate population restrictions eased.) Kid Rock looks like Donald Trump smells like. Actually states hospitalization rate going down. small horses

I'm picturing small horse plane now. Pipe dream US parts world executing plan effectively. matter priorities guess? Elon Musk slime, seem ""anti science,""

Elon Musk anti science. See: FSD, Starlink, Hyperloop, Neuralink, etc. Yeah, needs happen apparently let’s get with. wish could blink eyes 2020 over. I’m done. US wants #1 everything. Winning! Times like makes wonder democracy voters countries gullible times go stupid tangent every again. fo4got /s. rest world whole heartedly apologize half country fucking morons. would surprised one bit open boarders us September 2021, stay safe reddit fam. Yup  here. Whenever finally calms I'm checking roach motel. really anyone anyway, missed. worse case isn’t, even go next one ends kinda event. gotta think either way team trump gonna say huge success. really don’t want hear everything’s fine narrative pointing Tulsa Rally evidence Yeah gives people something do. Coproculture Technician Lets guess, 0 cases china again? haven’t given anyone name, I’m saying according state it’s working reason said. 
Maybe people feel sense responsibility comply also feel sense responsibility keep job keep roof head family’s head. 
So maybe take chance ok around odds aren’t high got keep going don’t lose job case didn’t get all.
I’m speaking personal experience state government said. 

There articles contract tracing doesn’t work well places without social safety nets. didn’t anyone WARN me?! Wow, thanks insults. feel contributed bad information acted poor manor entire time. can’t give clear information constantly say things make question information. cheerleader must, worthy. latest post Asymptomatic spread thought better example happened. examples top head, sure find more. Cats death machines. reason house cats don’t kill people they’re tiny. You’re confirmed racist social degenerate. Nobody cares think anything. Two months ago thinking bad going get India. took longer start thought going catastrophic. many people living poverty packed together. pray them. anywhere US contract tracing? heard happening trump still better trump. theory cases necessarily leading deaths? Common sense left building right around time truth murdered, thought next niece compassion nephew kindness kidnapped sister integrity tortured. wished someone would show mercy.

In honesty though, worked long enough dealing thousands people daily common sense really starts seem like common. quite eliminated yet. Think 5 active cases here. people arrived overseas quarantine, apart two people let quarantine centre drive half length country go funeral fucking tested let out. Prime minister happy. Yea right. I'm American can't help it. someone insults can't let go. Reddit me. Signing off. mean ""only"" 20% people would assumption? country even remotely close that. handful countries 1% population infected. Sadly, thing indigenous people since portuguese arrived 500 years ago. always ''weak'' respiratory diseases coming outside corona around can't even imagine going happen them, especially since government giving help need friends fucking ignorant stupid, they'll start thinning too.

FTFY spike new infections mostly occurred within past week. Deaths follow starting 2-3 weeks. Global warming bring people together would think would? fact, gave thinking humanity chance last year older people tried shit talk teenage girl. see deliberately ignored part using lock get rest control.

The lockdown keeps things control long lockdown effect. lifted, like unkinking hose. 

Regarding /u/MDJ1981's Italy (worst hit country Europe) 21k infected population 60m. number falling STEADILY every day.

All terrible numbers worse even United Give one month less 5k infected.

We'll see. lot depends lockdown measures relaxing lockdown worked. people masks.

Well, actually justify causation, disprove it, though again, Goldman 2020, *Voluntary Cyclical Distancing: potential alternative constant level mandatory social distancing, relying 'infection weather report'* justify position. provide claim run off. matters, write scholarly literature justifying position. 

It'll take month two lockdown ending result noticable surge. dramatic depend quickly completely lockdown ends given region. He's completely wrong.

CDC's made ass themselves. like people shut businesses down. CDC said kept shut while. everyone quarantine. open schools rare kids disease. Swedish model seems better.

Impossible navigate situation efficiently top nobody's condemning protests health hazard brings Covid.

Now everyone wear mask (Sweden's mandating it). 1 month might say ""masks really necessary""

The CDC's made ass themselves, opinion SAY? say ""Africa cannot afford testing,"" that's bullshit. Africa continent country, probably countries within Africa can't afford testing, that's true places within Africa. Thank :) Sorry. I’ve subscriber long forgot existed. imagine fucked tourists would park cars airports. Actually said essentially yesterday tweet user error kind get dummies even today wear seatbelts wrong they're uncomfortable *at least they're wearing them* /s. suddenly get rid seatbelts them. get fined hopefully they'll wear correctly least avoid fine. think point trying make teen far healthy title implies. see coming from, read other's posts negative tone, read positive tone, nobody rude escalated. Please apologize other, move day. What? mention massive protests every city last 3 weeks social distancing little mask use? Could cause uptick? Nah, must something else. Outdoors seems real factor. several people see photo they’re wearing mask it’s picture backs. Fair enough. still stand say first comment. God damn it, got nothing fucking compassion, fucks wear masks give fuck compassion anyway.

It's selfish asshole giving shit else endanger show friends badass following rules. asshole-shaming ignorant, selfish asstards every chance get. Tbf Canada less 40 million people. people California Canada. POTUS dismantled pandemic team right real.pandemic? That's also negligence. problematic dismantle scientists wrong scientists often wrong. whole point science testing prove things. problem science wrong. problem people stopped trusting science. better system science. remove scientists, follow science. Union Florida? Ahahaha. Good one mate. Good luck enforcing Keys lol I’m American even know they’re different breed ahaha Even is, 5-14 day incubation sheep won’t connect dots. Cite? get frustrated friends say ""yah covid bad really bad thought"".  

So many people died still dying alarming rate everyone gave giving shit. That's things work Europe. disagree. family hubdreds cats, live countryside. live longer, healtier lives, thats true. cat wild animal, live arent allowed live wilderness.. Yeah also beat doctor patient died hear say repeatably read exposure virus (like one four comprises 'flu'), related Corona viruses, give added immunity Corona. 

And far work try viruses.

So question stands. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* BRI~~C~~A nothing “being poor” everything self sufficiency independence. 

These jackasses run around screaming liberty “sheep dogs” reality want perceived tough. 

They can’t back actual, substantive actions. 

Like said... crow constantly “not needing help,” can’t survive month without paycheck bailout. 

Weakest sauce is. America decided acts like it’s gone, go back normal. testing means mild cases turning up. statistics age dependent sure. overall probably looking death rate 1 200 permanent health issues least 1 50. Pretty certain anyone sick enough go hospital COVID getting long term long damage, especially 40.

Bad news, better worse country letting everyone make risk decisions. Half country going run around consuming, help economy spread virus. half stays home, staying safe, crushing economy. worst worlds. really need vaccine antibodies last longer couple months - ruined years. Trump Downward trend? Yes 700 day less peoples predictin 1500 day. Seasonality. Summertime😀 wear told to. Shut fuck  Figuratively  Doctors aren’t rushing put everyone ventilators, turns killing them. Lol, know I'm right everyone starts calling names rather dispute facts. told shut fuck Portapotties always flush, sometimes sitting pit despair   Kinda pisses get rona spreading wear mask, fuck faces say ""I NeVeR GoT IT, HoAX"" kinda makes want wear mask. alas empathy shit (whoever may be) benefitting?
I'm saying scam way, covid defenitely real, nearly dangerous world population first expected.
But can't see who's benefitting times that's you, pretty ignorant think one benefits pandemic. dont get impression we're testing manner china. read theory spike cases youre seeing related people coming contact people virus. old people, count. Hands freedums!! /s forget literal shitshow restrooms be. Texas Rangers / Royals spring training facility town. Mayor attended citywide events symptoms present 5 days ago. great news. played idea hold entire season AZ. couldn’t believe it!! studies floating around says mild cold caused corona-virus past year better immune response COVID-19. poor isolated people probably even know flu is. think they've already convinced Covid big deal/is conspiracy/is cold/etc. wearing mask stupid pointless deluded. government forcing partake delusions unacceptable. Yeah, otter proofread posts! Im first responder trying work (doing CPR etc) wearing gown/goggles/n95 terrible keep scrolling page see graph daily new deaths. Ok? turns institutions exist America, either. America's last island - end universe plus side time higher testing numbers.

This partially explains rise.

The positive test percentage rising well, points loss containment. Ah old “go burn 5g tower down” discredit “conspiracy theory”. term created stop people questioning governments narrative.

5g isn’t killing us, it’s danger companies installing 5g infrastructure Chinese. Much like countries trying stop huawei expanding west, although claim independent inherently answer orders Chinese government. Much like warfare 1000 BC, WW1,2 proxy wars 21st century, warfare told. Maybe we’re already engaged warfare don’t know it?

You’ve already seen companies like Facebook google literally create profile tailor specific ads, 5g used breach privacy even already do. Ha ha, I’m guessing you’re bringing potato salad? snot say probably surpass wars way going. Given talk Coronavirus ""plumes"" flushing toilet, see portajohn could good idea. I'm sure there's study somewhere depths internet. Lmao turned set reminders all

Itd play 'Siri, set reminder two weeks' thing saw teitter hope you’re correct, things may get severe single area like NYC, really doesn’t look great places like AZ, FL, TX, etc. there’s high percentage corona-deniers, unhealthy people, willfully ignorant among general population. Carry alcohol based wipes/sanitiser, wipe everything, wear mask, clean hands regularly.

Best way catch stay home watch TV. stupidest thing read. No-one takes seriously. close ties Denmark right next Denmark, like regions close Finland close ties to... well... Finland. Norway. 

Denmark lost wars remains tiny nation Sweden gave former territories(such Norway) votes independence. bring history know nothing about. understand people's argument wearing one funny Arizona land locked Florida 

Anyone I've met Arizona straight ignorant basic truths Covidactnow.org pretty detailed information state. know Michigan proactive texting advertising, lot contact tracers special call centers set up. Anyone working outside home get testing pretty easily. 

The numbers hopefully continue show results effort. I’m cautiously optimistic. gather, think NHL might get away it. Rumors circling around entire playoffs NHL could take place Canada might work bubble system NBA Orlando. blue side things wear silly looking sex slave masks!!!! /s course is. even question? 

A competent corrupt government would provide material benefits population. Measurable progress form wealth, health, on. Whereas incompetent honest government would help anyone, even itself. thoroughly disappointed trip there. never made key west entire ride 7 mile Bridge Isla Morada commercial underwhelming. Well it’s remaster, right? blu-ray version I'm Newfoundland. Things starting open alot we've 1 new case 30 days current active cases island. commenters special breed stupid. agree there. Less people going hospital, like mortality rate nearing average, points towards decrease total infections. Mother duker Lol, oh get wrong death lots it. Ro percent now, 1.6, guessing. Maybe drops 1.2 seen China protests.  Yeah, hoenstly, hasn’t even gotten bad expected reopening. simply can’t imagine job would fire someone quarantining required health department. force someone come work that’s massive liability there’s outbreak.

In NJ passed legislation can’t fired laid required quarantine doctor health department. 

Could troublesome informal economy amount success better 0. health departments also reported great success also troubles. 

The neighboring town mine health department keeps good statistics site two active cases 50+ April, population 25,000. 

My town reporting 7 new cases per week now, deaths weeks, population 60,000. 

The health departments fantastically this, see NYtimes article Paterson NJs valiant efforts. It’s small city that’s pretty rough history. Protests too. world gone mad Going tough get sports going year problem sort out. going fuck economy kill even loved ones, good news lot data anti mask crowd use hunt later ruin lives.


Caught violating mask law? Oh gonna get fired, fined, maybe jailed. portable toilets

are safe use? always try avoid That's true, also unplug anything hospital room know does. forgetting hell going places. 

Young people less likely stubborn science deniers. oh fuck yeah spread remember someone forum laughing suggested US coronavirus deaths combat deaths combined.

Sad see milestones quickly reached.

Total US Combat deaths, wars:  think hospitalisation spike already happening many ICUs several states rapidly diminishing capacity. like spread NY. n85 made claustrophobic hard breathe. like 30 minutes. can't imagine wearing day. thought they’d cancelled pro sport till September? 

But seems reasonable, 5,000 fans isn’t huge amount stadiums although I’d still rather see focus accessible broadcast rather trying rely fans. YouTube unreliable.

India 4 times number geniuses have. going higher that. Superspreader-in-Chief give flying fuck. also CA (though rural) one glad state requires it. county already required it, county bullied health department reopening, started protesting wearing masks, fearful county would bullied making masks optional. correct answer Brazil case probably able report many deaths saturated.

The regular flus (Typically 2 5 ongoing strains flu sweeping world year) infect around 1 billion people, kill around 400,000 year. That's 0.04% mortality rate combine influenza strains given year. 

Covid-19 currently infected around 9,000,000 confirmed cases, killed 460,000 today, course less 6 months. That's 5.1% mortality rate one disease. makes Covid-19 127.5 times deadly regular flu strains given year. 

Now, current best guesses take 75% regions population contract disease, around 70% global population contract disease herd immunity finally wear down. needed regular flu Covid-19 far transmissible regular flu. That's around 5.5 billion people need get herd immunity kick in. Now, let's assume current mortality rate high due testing keeping active cases let's conservative guess true mortality may closer 4% like many agencies suggested. That's still potential 220000000 (220 Million) people could die coming waves number years vaccine produced. 

It would take regular flus 550 years kill many people. 

So no, slightly worse flu, which, way, still killing people alongside this. rookie numbers, gotta pump numbers yet, people keep pushing cure... corruption government.

I talking CFR talking IFR. two different related measurements.

I saying equivalent ""Joe's eyes 5 feet ground he's standing bare feet"", saying ""but tell us tall is"".

That true, fact remains Joe's eyes 5 feet ground give us range overall height.

For example Joe can't 4 feet tall eyes 5 feet ground, unless he's standing box.

We say, however, Mary's eyes 4 feet ground standing bare feet, strong indication Joe taller Mary.

Neither eye measurement gives us true heights, still used compare two people.

Am supposed wearing mask time I’m house reason? young child frequently (like daily) put stroller walk local park back without stopping touch anything letting stroller, never wear mask. see people wearing masks park many. hand, time stop sort store, put mask use hand sanitizer frequently.

What actual recommendation? places like California, wearing masks outdoors too?? Wtf... Render unto Caesar daily dose hope. ""The lottery balls said 'Soros,' 'chemtrails' 'Hillary.'

Any speculations timeline? evidence this?? Also NYC here....not sure walking, I'm seeing maybe 40% people masked around Union Square area. I'm even counting people wearing mask pulled around neck immune system active night, that's nightfall usually sucks sick. I'm SWFL well. Neighbors sunbathing together lock down. may want see doctors telemedicine get refills prescriptions delivered. u/undeleteposter honest, I'm surprised taking long, especially given what's happening warmer states heat drives people indoor AC spaces.

It’s twitter post... exactly scientific begin with. 

Honestly don’t care anyone’s arguments shit anymore. I’m wearing mask visit store, I’ll wear one outside I’m going around people. Pretty easy adjustment live with. doesn’t make difference end, oh fucking well. Indeed, friend.

Instead, get corona parties.

Which opposite, less desirable direction. prior coronavirus infection stimulates t-cell response COVID, suspected.

There's reason cases fall sharply everywhere 20-30% threshold reached. use go walks without masks, see many others wearing masks do. Even though know liklyhood infected passing someone walking absurdly low thing happened lost sense taste smell due flu took OTC drugs recover years, take OTC flu drugs that. say right is.... Fucking yeeeeooooooo

Hopefully eventually get zero cases infected get outside Thursday 8pm scream 'ATS US NAAAAAIIIIII' Never interrupt enemy making mistake. Coronavirus (not covid19 strain) common virus found humans, typically 10-20% population coronavirus immune system. Wether makes sick different figure mostly harmless. There’s high chance test false test WASNT designed test contagious diseases stated creator, yet are. Using test. *shocked pikachu face* can't call 'pretending Covid-19 exist' plan. Crowd scenes lot times VFX’d, that’s new phenomenon COVID. Sure, need people order multiply group post, producers play cards right follow guidelines shouldn’t big deal. read much anything Swedish government said.

Then arguing things Swedish government said? one talking Ireland brought 0.5% people die related illnesses due job losses unable access medical services, measures taken directly caused deaths covid. 

**IF**

There indication happen. fact, Ireland's mortality currently well baseline according mental physical health detriments effectively house arrest length time remains seen, significant. 

Maybe... maybe not. fact remains, Ireland fewer deaths per population fewer cases per population Sweden. Ireland gone route Sweden, would seen far cases many, many factors consider judging strategies country taken. black white appears. 

No one ever said black white. However, economic damage heals. Dead people can't brought back life.

Sweden suffering economic damage Ireland... many dead top. Huntington beach, Orange County? guys ever teacher put whole class timeout something, one person tried talk friend, timer would start over? 

This we're going national scale. Every fucker wearing mask stopping early asshole kid kept getting timer set back 0. Deaths plateaued probably creeping next week. getting notion confirmed cases based symptoms tests? That's happens state health director dismisses every issue state governor reacts 5 years late. correct several times continued ((((misundertand)))) 

This thread nice content. Fear circlejerking must domain. enjoyed quarantine working home. Lol 😂 love cats much maybe subconscious slip obviously meant cars concerning also suspect people recovered lingering symptoms going online telling yo everyone... Gloucester county here. It’s beautiful  someone thinks Trump like pope wants kiss child, something would never million years even there's pandemic always felt like improvement Moltke's quote:

""No plan survives contact main force ""Everyone themselves"" got mess. bad. neighborhood Fort Myers. Lee County plans make masks mandatory. Funny state recorded many cases today good day. county posted numbers high multiple times this.

But seriousness, casinos require employees masked. still pretty early, make everyone wear masks could lock stay open. Looking good big event later tonight... I'm glad reminded this, thinking finding city similarly-sized similar infection trajectory compare next weeks Let explain bullshit then.  States broke trying avoid layoffs.  cant afford pay tracers.. untrained volunteers. essential worker bitter af. Woo fucking vacation. Things get bad again—*they* ones stay working, 4+ people’s work anger/fear/frustration everyone directed them. come home drained life hear people talk Pinterest projects, much moolah they’re making unemployment, whine bored are. us stayed working would like fucking break. 

I’m bitter af happy save lives. nothing, ungrateful brats don’t wanna deal anymore? Just, can’t. masks get political? Frankly, disagree breadth order (I think kids 12 shouldn’t wear them, I’m ambivalent outdoor use except crowded settings) adults need grow mask whenever they’re inside. soooo much.. 😷🤦🏼‍♀️ keep mind, thanks tip! That's right would think they'd common sense shut down, owners make player sign waiver players going refuse Hahaha. No. Still first one imo. tbh idk Scientific definition. Well, bad pandemic things definitely trending upward. It’s crazy NJ live there’s lot outward disdain masks. live work area that’s cusp trumpists liberal folk, they’re split. real weird. I’m glad it’s getting better, it’s easy terrible mean culture wants what’s best collective whole everyone part even it’s minor personal sacrifice? Yes. Live Sacramento I've definitely noticed less less people wearing masks last couple weeks. relatively good compared rest thr state too.  Harder government face track you. no. 2 weeks. get keep pushing out. happening me, jesus christ glad going crazy here. never sick long life. virus lethal even affect others? hear stories healthy 20-some year olds underlying conditions catching virus caused kidney/heart/lungs fail die. also hear stories people don’t even know they’re tested symptoms. CDC says 35% asymptomatic. possible one person die virus, another person asymptomatic, even young healthy? luck? Wtf about? wrong whole rally makes soo happy? - like people going really need gene pool tbf. gotta cull herd might aswell stupid ones ya? Figured I'd chime Narcolepsy experience. started feeling complete exhaustion amount sleep could touch. Nothing would help, sleep, less sleep, caffeine, fresh air, exercise. gave driving realized alert enough behind wheel. Anytime sitting could fall asleep. read watch TV kept falling asleep. gears brain ground halt fog exhaustion. would forget things, put things belong. People would talk 10 minutes later completely forgot it. 

I sleeping 12 16 hours day. stressed hours gone everything needed happen awake hours available me. Every minute went towards chores, work, doctors appointments, time unwind. lost 60 pounds 3 months exhausted feed myself. Doctors kept telling depression even though knew depressed. medical leave job months. two years diagnosed Narcolepsy another year found treatment worked me. 

There lot things need keep Narcolepsy control. sleep entirely controlled medication. need strictly observe sleep hygiene every single day. slip one thing get tired leads slip ups quickly find back square one. struggle get back control happens. spend lot time sleep clinic treatment comes side effects need monitored. fun far better alternative Wave 2 come... Yes masks many people traveling harder got Cali Az. Actually Florida death rate around 150 per million rising. 

In outbreaks deaths make 5-10% hospitalisations that's potentially 30.000 sustaining long term health complications affects livelihoods. 

Then there's can't access medical care ailments hospitals end overwhelmed covid cases. 

In long run shutting actually financially cheapest option. Yeah, I'm glad use excuse living state cause family (but parents) would definitely give crap. states haven’t followed lead absolutely beyond me.

My governor thought poor idea toss covid pts nursing homes. Yeah except restaurants last night sea obese people risking rally. Wonder heard severity covid-19 relative weight weight caused health issues. confirmed timeline. lot speculative talk September/ October time based stock prices people trying drive companies stock prices 10 fold like maderna etc. perhaps let meet &amp; greet Trump lol doubt would wear mask even 🤦🏻‍♀️ pubs opened Spain yet, they're open UK.

Can imagine British hooligans, long deprived public houses, let loose Spain?

I'm sorry, Spain knows British, problem now. you. Outdoor transmission normal setting pretty low. Distancing hand washing important ones. Wearing mask socially distance, indoors, exhibiting symptoms becomes important. could literally careless. unicorn could manifest eyes, bludgeon hundreds people flinch. Nothing phases anymore lol Make sure take deep breaths occasionally, relax minute, get back whatever planning doing. long road circumstance, take cars regularly. Depends Americans exactly prove it, I'd skeptical numbers either way. 

On flip side, also need consider number deaths worldwide attributed Covid-19 countries assumed cases included, cause death attributed Covid-19 even though comorbities, etc. happened UK, Ireland USA countries aware of. There's plenty read, posted tip iceberg.

Here main point:

There serious research side argument. Whether feel unsatisfied dozens reports particle movement, mask materials, infection patters, population analysis, etc, sure review counter reports would least present counter argument weight. none.

Ultimately, like arguing whether sun yellow purple. post 100 links analysis angles yellowness sun, say seem inconclusive view, going find serious report sun purple except rare ones said took snapshot 1 minute sunset found purple tint.

But simply take quick glance thing notice yellow: South Korea US discovered first covid case day, next weeks infection rates ramped around speed. Except today South Korea 280 deaths total. South Korea decided early use masks. That's main difference.

Masks work. Period. need convincing read on. Read research analysis want, points result. What's probability catching covid roommate does? work home following quarantine T. However roommate dumbass understand science still goes eat bar almost every night. interact reason, I'm worried chances living them.  would put swastika card assuming amount geniuses per capita, assumption basis for. I'll ask again, evidence support claim? Bruh 
 It’s working you’re trying lower state’s average age

No thanks believe reason all, yeah, you’re bright. want risk people you’re horny. jump forever months.

Yeah, self absorbed dip shit.

You want constructive? Okay.

It would really great stopped self absorbed dip shit. Lol “freedom living Americans refusing wear masks!” 
+20% infection spread  never thought I’d utter words (in context) - Go Blue! ❤️from 614🏈 Ah post link Trump related virus story without getting deleted! wanted post thing ""Trump"" headline sent moderation worried taking ""Tulsa Rally,"" I'd deleted modifying headline. Oh well, least here. guess we’ll never know do. Darwin... ya magic thanking them, majority working population essentially gaining herd immunity, come cave safer. 4-D chess move sub LIVES miserable. news amazing they’re denial. weird.  Outdoor seating opens Monday big first test, hopefully screw up

I've eating sit restaurants since memorial day. know places exist right? people risk family members, that's good test people, states well test nursing home workers regularly bad hit. It’s working you’re trying lower state’s average age
 Bruh know what's funny? According 2019 article, [Donald supposedly half years term, President Donald Trump solidifying standing germ-conscious man ever lead free world.  House aides said president simply displaying common sense: Trump keeping hands clean good way avoid getting him, staff, sick.

You'd think germophobe would welcome use masks goddamn pandemic, right? Nope, fucking moron. He'll abandon anti-germ instincts thinks it'll fire base. he's going send lot hospital, though.

Donald utter shit everything does, can't even germophobia right. know happened Asia isn’t apology America don’t know is.

Unplugging ventilator (believing pandemic blown proportion) plug cooler (no social distancing, heading bars beaches). Even Australia shut states. Granted states HUGE major cities quite spread apart, helped containment immensely. Arizona uncontrolled exponential phase since start June. Hospitals nearing capacity lockdown another 2-3 months. Every country state tried approach failed, situation ending lockdowns. I'm hoping states part control block travel areas minimum impose 14 day quarantines. Two words ... Fucking idiot! moron, know else say. ...Other spent 3 years living FL, state absolutely awful. Visit it, **DON'T** live - *ever*. Come central Florida. 10-20% wear masks. Everyone else couldn’t bothered. saddens say I’m Southeast Michigan there’s people broader social circles currently advocating flash-mobs idea BUNCH people show store shop without masks. Unfortunately you, people also properties North don’t plan cancelling trips. MURQA FUCK YEAH Expect Trump rally soon. Shit. bad. notice date thought new. going delete post since really ""news"". Sorry!  DeSantis &amp; Ducey = DD = Dumb &amp; Dumber *Nice people get infected, means disease spreadable people thought. We're going similar shift mentality NYC, loads protestors social distancing half wearing masks disease still fizzling out. people say ""the protests outside."" true, many people arm arm, took subway Manhattan, like room spread like does♥️ think meant say right-y pals? would great Michigan island, means nothing since they're part larger country basically given containment. USA! USA! Pretty sure never kissed own. Except Ivanka obviously. YUP. FIX in. Politics 101: dont racist. Yikes pandemic totally shattered whatever faith remaining government populace. certainly lack resources facillities expertise tackle plague. **It's American people refuse follow simple steps would end thing (masks, distancing, quarantine).** watching live stream youtube one wearing fuckin mask inside. 72% approval rate so..... I’m tired. explaining anything covid related. feel like broken record nobody ever listens. Wear mask stay fuck home people. family friends 

Probably safest thing COVID.

On side note story exact reason bullshit spreads cure. call anecdotal, lay person, bullshit. people, especially ones hospitalized, survive COVID even 80+ year olds.  States Control imo like little pregnant. cut States Control Complete (air, travel, transport stuff on) ok together it. all, whole world. good article. tough choice Donny, one hand, could sold 20,000 MAGA Masks, other, fragile image. Tell elected officials using religion guide policy choices. 

It’s sad grown ass people can’t handle reality live fucking fantasy novel instead metric R\_effective, ICU space, positive test rate, contact tracers. Maine middling R contact tracing metrics good ICU/positive test rate, seems like cusp. also hard low R cases. Yeah protests here, media said true. Rules thee me. can't see florida, arizona texas able write much longer. face mask mandate good going look like two weeks? four weeks? 8 weeks? annual Michigan Renaissance Faire opens mid-August. (Unless state intervenes) There's much arguing masks (that faire says required participants ""recommended"" patrons) facebook group leave.

I've going festival 20 years I'm staying home year. There's barely running water handwashing people assholes ask smoke booths. anti-safety crowd full force (and they'll drinking heavily) way keep anything contained gets in. easily see two three weeks faire undoing everything that's gained.

People travel far away Wisconsin go faire. Bristol faire canceled, probably people Wisconsin Chicago going Michigan faire. totally going shit show want nothing it. worry dude, count going even opened.




The count people is.. I'm sadly south hear over. I'll never understand cant hear utterly stupid sound. Itt forgetting even asymptomatic carriers virus ground glass opacities lungs. know effects scientists salivating one. It’ll like one big ass case study. Instacart service offering contact day delivery. Please don’t go out. offer anyone nearby text $$ (via venmo similar) grab stuff leave doorstep dont go out, works too. Please dont go shopping ill, even mask. could save someone’s life staying home blame China warning us. Oh mention CNN? see anywhere comment... Fox News literally pushing anti-science agenda decade support stance climate change. Ever heard kinda phrases fox newsers ""what scientists even know"" ""some pediatricians even kids, listen them""? No, that's point fencing buildings, yes police around outside fencing. problem players people, too. Often impoverished communities color. players become champions otherwise invisible communities. players kids federal government.

I think selfish ask people put risk bored. true. point April jumped shark fear mongering, press, ""it live beach"" ""it spray 60 feet out"" articles opinion pieces science. Alot news sources lost lot credibility I’m waiting see COVID deniers try spin things back exponential growth. 

“We’re testing more! tests, cases. real case figures actually declining. failed high school algebra three times, that’s statistics work!” right. federal government made clear recommendations mixed messaging couldn’t hurt. anecdotally result basically nobody's big jump can't attributed Memorial Day grand opening. think first really big inside event since size protest plus size rally combined far exceed proportional size protests

If look list US Cities organized population, find Tulsa Minneapolis Tampa side-by-side think city's look bigger protest Minneapolis less strict governor Tampa there's probably pretty good control hypothesis I’m pretty conservative (but somewhat wealthy) area northern Michigan right mask compliance high. Went Meijer day people noticed wearing masks big bearded dudes dressed camo (some electric scooters). Shocker I'll add Pres could modeled good sense procedures like mask wearing social distancing rather eschewing them, politicizing them. would say that? every person work either Gen X Boomer almost nobody takes seriously. Right? others mentioned deaths dropping high rate eight weeks got downvoted. Excess mortality Sweden back 0. What's point stringent lock-down now? Wow that’s crazy basically got lucky. UK lockdown happened 2 weeks behind curve compared London. shows important early weeks are. odds depend closer animals terms physiology humans, good disease model animal is. Non-human primates similar get humans, good models coronavirus affects differently, seem get much milder infection. So, long story short, odds high. also why, preclinical studies animals mostly done safety efficacy. 

What steps needed? animal experiments possible, determining dosage, antibody levels etc. animals. Toxicology studies done already. 

Technology new, vesiculoviruses used before, know extent successful. 

What odds Vegas? drug/vaccine pre-clinical phase makes market 10% time, broadly speaking. bet vaccine I'd give 5-10%. 🤣🤣 buckle boys, going bumpy ride knew finally going happen sooner later. Wonder point people base FINALLY say ""oh shit"" attend. fact downvoted sub thread wtf. Well I’m type I’ve got hair past shoulders guess I’m good poor bus drivers. Meh, true. patients hospital would flare night. It’s likely due Coker temperature night, causes bronchoconstriction. Couple laying supine likely layering pleural effusion, bad time. I'm even remotely surprised they'll blame SE MI residents inevitably get sick thanks taking zero precautions whatsoever. Exactly. amount absolutely confirmed diabetes cases rolling around place astounding. Western IL I'd say 90-95% mask. Went Lowe's ones wearing mask employees It’s hypothesized, nowhere near proven point. even 20-30% population 640,000-960,000 infected Utahns (which means 6,400-9,600 dead Utahns). level saturation (a) happening 2-3 weeks (b) would horrendous outcome. [Zinc come ""The protests cause surge!""

r/agedlikemilk  fault, take responsibility I’m guessing less requirement seeing news beginning take seriously. Call friend? Doordash CVS now. Curbside pick up. really avoid going inside anywhere even mask. That's north part Florida Oh yeah, CNN gives loads facts time. Gimme break Jesus. many times explain it? comparing apples apples. thing saying Sweden's CFR said nations' CFR.

However, comparing one nation's CFR another's tell something.

In case Sweden vs rest world, tells us one two things - either Swedish government worse comes identifying number cases - Sweden suffering many deaths per infection nations.

We know Sweden's virus deadly, either Swedish medical system performing poorly, resulting higher percentage deaths, number cases Swedish government identifying much lower nations identifying.

Either way, reflection Sweden compared nations... failing. Abrakadabra, corona away...🤡  Yes, that's stupid Fauci drama queen keeps coming dramatic statements stay press. many sanctimonious statements Americans deny science, Fauci actually saying scientific? Every couple dies tries get news saying ""it get worse."" That's it. Nothing Winning Yep got headline right there! Bill Gates made-in-China chips You’re joking, right?

They unplugged random machine fucking ICU.

That’s almost bad shooting someone saying “oops thought trigger safety” going “ah, sounds like accident I’m lawyer.” Hahahahahaha!!!




HHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH! realize wearing mask exact opposite snowflake behavior


Ask know you’re using words without really understanding underlying concept meaning going HoChunk casino Dells grandmas years ago passed billboard it. Hearing grandmas say ""Crusin Chubbys"" unison something never forget. read NYT article unless coerced, Japanese government shut businesses, unlike state governments, arbitrarily ordered business closures (but hey, liquor stores a-ok). answered question. That's answer. welcome. Well it’s going eradicated might well live little life left astronomically high death rate. love invade Hampton Beach. Michigan high ratio contact tracers per daily new case, even travel containable tracing works. penis must wear mask glory hole see yet another example failed high school chemistry! hope them...after all, [they giving official Trump campaign face masks clear they're sold rally today. info cities massive protests compared others didn’t? looking generally don’t think I’ve seen anything stood showing rise protests. visible due nearly everyone smartphones capturing video, surely. Really? I’m going back work right now. It’s people don’t choice. want end homeless decided go back work? want default loans didn’t money pay them? less dangerous? Deaths noticeably U.S. despite case load isn’t plummeting fast deaths.

Either strain weaker we’re hell lot better treating see every day full families three+ kids running around public parks one mask - parents included. walk mine nod, “you’re welcome.” tell corporate politicians wanting money forcing US allow SARS spit swapping causing accelerating cases. don't. Fauci speaks sides mouth. said needed earlier. Hong Kong another outbreak? 

Is possible Fauci changed recommendation data came in? kind science works. 

I heard new outbreak Hong Kong google search (albeit quick one) show anything. But, show total death count 4. recent Hong Kong article found this: 

They talk heavily mask big part containment. present time, widespread use masks everywhere supported high-quality scientific evidence, potential benefits harms consider. 

I'd interested seeing sources possible harms. 

 

Is study Cambridge university high-quality scientific study? countless others like this. 

Is 100% universal opinion? No, notably Michael Osterholm skeptical mask, pretty close unanimous point scientific community point. settings may possible keep physical distancing use mask could helpful provide barrier limit spread potentially infectious droplets someone infected.  important note masks used part comprehensive strategy. Masks protect COVID-19. People also clean hands frequently maintain distance least 1 metre others.

Yeah, one disputing this. Fauci GOAT way two weeks since anti-lockdown protests. HEB best. Seat belts also helps maintain control car keeping drivers seat accident. often helps keep injuring others. law, obeyed. lose freedom government requires seat belts required wear mask.

Also, quoting CatWeekends below...: help society whole driving post-accident medical costs down.

If wear seat belt wind seriously injured incapacitated... everyone else going wind paying help rest life disability payments higher insurance costs rest us. Sweden 505 deaths/million inhabitants. That's among worst globe.

That works ""5 people ever 10,000"".

And among worse globe pandemic?

There time year would thought bad.

Lets pretend last year, nobody heard Covid. telling story trip Africa.

And say ""While Kenya, *terrible* virus hit. devastating!""

You might say ""Oooh. bad it?""

I would say ""Well .. get this. 3 months, 10,000 people village ... *5 people died*!""

You would go ""Wait. say FIVE people?""

I would go ""YES! mostly 70s 80s. like Kenya! Villages saw one person every two thousand die. nightmare!""

You would probably think pulling leg. would like ""That actually doesnt sound bad"".

But are. Source? heard this. first marriage end? OK. people wonder? known since outbreaks China Italy. New York could focused protecting vulnerable. Oddly... yes...yes exactly. Agreed 100% r/Masks4All hear? We’ve already declared victory invisible enemy. Huge win administration. beautiful. Bigly success. /s Vaccine may never come want stay inside forever? ""Look! like grab there! compliment."" /s like mass protests? ""He needs kidney.....and two.."" Let's ask....just promote want to. 😆 24 years? Closer 40. Fauci really actually practiced medicine doctor past residency, become medical bureaucrat shortly following getting MD. statement trust everything says simply he's job 40 years ridiculous. grimace every time read news he's introduced ""America's top infectious disease expert"", since obviously not. He's top bureacrat NIAID. would like claiming Trump ""best politician country"" simply president. anyone worked bureaucracies, know top man usually one touch things ground.  brother aware even [asymptomatic people's lungs potentially Among 139 patients COVID-19 hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) asymptomatic. chest CT radiographic findings analyzed.

That testing important - know certainty virus had. 

I work hospital &amp; care Covid-19 SARS patients, illness lasts weeks &amp; hits much harder symptoms described.

TLDR: Yes, get tested. good news probably don’t covid, bad news definitely something designed apple Cupertino. virus isn’t less contagious dangerous reason countries states US starting open up. unfortunate sounds, think best bet stay quarantined there’s vaccine we’re going keep seeing cycles rising falling cases. Something viral load guessing Let's skydive! 💪 agree opening back up, keeping social distancing masks now, keeping things locked may best stopping virus 100% yeah would lower fatality rate, addressing economic concerns. someone explain guarantee keep things locked indefinitely come acceptable damage rate economy life know compared virus would do, I'm willing hear it. think least possible lockdown could literally destroy country eventually,and get nuked something we're shambles better worth it, find virus 2 times deadly flu? maybe living covid like normally flu way better option accept fatality rate shitty may be. Mom! Donald doesn’t wear mask! doh wanna! doh wanna! DOH WANNNNNNNAAAHHH! Ironically, masks also prevent spread virus exactly type thing help economy recover without closing everything again. true! Thank :) don’t lose weight gym mean believe Trump anymore, going start believing science right? make tinfoil masks? weird fan fiction rolled mind many times... personally, also think “admitting” healthcare workers reason, think REAL reason pressure Trump “task force” repeat negative mask mantra masks 1. Openly admitting truth (and Trump start.) 2. Bad optics economy. think walked tightrope keeping job informing public. Everyone told truth ended silenced. think reluctant admit put position, caused harm public health it. situation progressed became outspoken he, “task force” became phased come go looking find saying. cheered turned away politics, bothers allowed “the risk low” “masks don’t work” narrative continue. wanted blow whistle louder harder. still listen him, don’t forget missteps—which still seek many sources studies discern myself. astounds many others zero interest so. 
My parents (Fox News watchers) still come crazy bullshit, won’t visiting grandkids valid shot arms. Idk extremely. I'm AZ really bad. poorly done studies. 

Even ignoring fact *absolutely* immunity without antibodies, they're badly done. 

The first one found 90% C-19 positive patients test positive antibodies. false negative rate range antibody tests have, that's exactly we'd expect *do* antibodies. 

The second, egregious, studies tested HCW antibodies. first, removed previously confirmed cases testing pool. Then, assumed 25% HCW previously infected thought they'd higher infection rate general population (even though pretty much serological studies found opposite). get expected 25%, concluded must antibodies lost them. 

These studies survive peer review, irresponsible reporting like this. understand conversation attempting participate in. Darwinism works. Let play out. Black plague took alot lower class panned eventually. conservatism came to, denying science. imagine accountability legal stuff 😂 I’ll still step-foot Florida go yearly vacations...but I’ll stay isolated Sanibel Island. Enjoyable miserable. Probably much like pledging lol stop work pandemic stopped them. keep working need fucking money, like go front crowd dressed fucking monkey perform hot ass suit covered ass sweat perform complete strangers. Circumcision schmucks OMGOGMOGMOGMOGMOOMGOMGOMGOMG could ever survive that? versus, what... 100k deaths? wtf? Thanx buddy. one thing scares get car accidents something like that, doctor able help hospitals slammed covid. Yes due dumb America! try parents super Asian they’re trying limit Natural selection work? Thoughts prayers uninvot people infect afterwards though, ending ~~ICU~~ mass grave. Pretty soon West realize food vehicle covid. Aaah yes, RE-INFECTION. Good. Fucking idiot.  play online games friends. He's right tho. Look new death trends. They've dec,icing 7 weeks FL simply disagree. 

Throughout life, anytime I’ve protested movement, I’ve heard it’s “not good time protest” reason reason when, reality, critics never “good time” never want hear it.

Anecdotally, protests I’ve BLM outdoor close everyone wearing mask. 

Literally everyone free go anywhere want now. Restaurants, bars, nightclubs, hair salons, gyms, etc.

If protests account 0.0000001% infections (I don’t know number accurate accounts it’s low) - think it’s fair say fair time protest.

The motivation movement doesn’t come around every day.

You can’t bottle passion energy save appropriate time. Imagine try sell wearing mask pandemic something ""cool"" ""strong"" people they're compassionate, rather fact people are, fact, braindead. Sadly came late. mean guess better late never Arizona middle surge it’s going take weeks cools off. sub gets click baity every day. keeping us informed corona virus? thought that's sub was.... look fucking guy good idea wear mask moron! Terrorists....terrorists everywhere! need happy camps! Yeah, nice know something right $20000 real estate taxes! Good. Thank God. First impressions matter, complict message serious, public need masks, despite SARS variant causes pneumonia, kills via double pneumonia. 

China masked immediately, shown work. Fauci *deliberately* lied American public, knowing masks work everyone worn one. deliberately lied then, what's say he's lying now? 

Muddled, incorrect, politicized messaging lack trust got people dismiss him. main reason hard get people follow updated recommendations. 

Plus, he's part Administration that's shitting best practices political points. let young healthy get hospitals filled young healthy people. treatment, cure. That’s nothing proud 

I’m sure she’s polled kinds folks sun city It’s probably like like actual medical exemption vaccines. doctor right lol took screen shots thots

not mask sight URLs share, informal chatter? (I totally buy doctor's see things researchers gotten to, new one me.)  Right 80 I'd wear p100 go eat. yrs old death rate covid 0.2%.

Maybe known cases. show symptoms never tested number drops order magnitude. Also China (if believe it) zero 9 category. grossly overestimated virus. lockdowns mistake. basically flu anyone 40 without compromised immune systems. fact people expect scientists know absolutely everything

Well Fauci proclaims without caveat, hardly unexpected people believe ""science coronavirus prime example, literally brand new

No, new all, although would forgiven believing watching media. ""newness"" Covid-19 emphasized ""new"" drugs would examined efficacy despite thousands generic drugs already market. SARS MERS similar seems least Wuhan lab working similar viruses years, likely labs minute something changes idiots come ""see wrong that, must wrong everything else""

If lied to, especially life death issue, certainly idiot questioning things next time. due diligence.  No, can't energy -nandor probably don’t choice go back work.

This already discussed. moot point. People stop work funsies, stop work work right them. thing complain NC since it’s felony wear mask concealed carrying weapon, mandatory mask order used take away 2nd amendment “rights”.  People wearing masks must really insecure themselves. way get wear one tell tough make look. Every attendee Trump's Rulsa rally receiving free mask. We'll get see much compassion crowd. district entering 12 day lockdown. Hope effect wasted. LOL see you’re NC [Some make money, Doubtful. We're catching higher percentage cases right testing capacity much higher end March New York. estimated 3.5M New Yorkers infected COVID-19, last week March mid-April.  could sworn said cases before, I'm losing mind Bro work interventional radiology hospital. I'm actually writing you. I'm Tampa bay. look hospital almost 80% capacity ICU. totally normal. even back fully staffed yet. I'm shooting xrays radiology 1:30 enough procedures IR day. Hospitals nowhere near critical point. People understand hospitals expect packed normal basis coworkers didn’t mention don’t feel comfortable so. mentioned didn’t care. mentioned good sometimes wrong times. plenty reasons, possible reasons, might wear mask like regardless whether told it. 

On end, assume comfort that’s end story. also suspect reason see much backlash mask wearing simply people believing virus, authorities telling people early masks don’t work, misunderstandings virus works, lack care. would agree reasons haven’t made clear, have, haven’t always given straight forward message various authorities. One group says one thing, especially early on, another says something else. lot people inclined follow best sources information. problem partly info, still learning even, also heavily people. oh stacked everyone rich lot longer lifetime...But admit got worse Reagan. definitely harder survive 20s. respect anyone says without irony ""it's basically flu"" focus blame China? USA! USA ! USA! He's got double-wide somewhere Tennessee wrapped camo. No, normally. 35 years lived US, think ever saw anyone mask outside doctor's office hospital, except painting, cleaning, construction. 

It drives crazy selfish people wanting wear one. Rough day indeed, acting like shit's over. pretend exist, disappear/s Yo, too! travel hospital radiotherapy every day 10 days UK lockdown started. 

I gained weight chemo (my fault) start dieting Feb. fact anything go anywhere meant intermittent fasting quite easy initial difficult stage. IF/low carb M-F nice dinners weekend (takeaways/carby meals). Lost 25+lbs since started early March! start campaign men small penises wear masks. do. what? That's still 37k today also pretty massive watch?? People aren’t masking social distancing. lot people think it’s hoax data “fake.”

Keep us thoughts. hospital for. We've already seen covid related deaths patient never tested cause death pneumonia something else. Even skip stuff, always good scroll end check something shocking. Often, articles throw one last controversial tidbit. ""Totally worth it"" confidently stroll right past signs ignore anyone attempting get attention. 

Most people aren’t prepared completely ignore them, especially raise voices. 

The one person confronted completely unprepared loudly asking trying touch inappropriately calling police 

Most people freeze take script force play defense accusation aren’t prepared wait get point return climate change. crops grow certain areas anymore there's mass refugee crisis. million dollars bet, would politicians say, could anyone seen coming? Except wear mask public. wrong. 

I see need come gloat better everyone else it. I’m glad don’t, people need coaxed engaged toddler. People less mature stubborn think. live DFW terrifies know people travel shit. far all... Theres much outdoor seating here. coffee shop go im planning eat (just drink actually work), might outdoor seating sure. Would still case theres inside seating?  Yep! Theres enough gazpacho all!!! Or, make friends salad! airborne part also pertaining covid lol mass re-opening schools workplaces. Schools pretty bad since often hundreds students crowded together narrows hallways relatively small classrooms, often put groups. sure. close done. People suspecting India going peak somewhere August-Novemner. Looking India right now, good. nothing alleviate situation condescending people afar feeling self righteous top posting online clout. 


I think I’ve found redditor prime. can't spread virus right without rallies Holy shit, actually sent exact link earlier today explained findings him. odds.

He insisted ""rare,"" findings ""not confirmed."" told lack data makes even scarier. fact know little virus, yet see full scope long-term effects repeated trials future. fact yet confirm widespread permanent organ damage is, would wise err side caution understand virus. 

It fruitful debate, ultimately. kept attacking ad hominens ""dude, extremist, look worst case scenarios. chances getting lung damage like chances getting run car."" impossible get people. Findings like ones go one ear right other. proves virus come back where. People shouldn’t let guard all. necessarily strong.. non-whiny. “Granted” Trump thinks short term. look financial career. hypocrisy begins. want change, stop labeling people. American news right face im even American note, Brazil also reported record-smashing 55,209 new cases Friday. US also crossed 30k Friday first time since May 1st. Rough day, folks. added s/ fixed comment count though Stopped watching news last 3.5 years. I’m south asia know works. government cut corruption spending, could provide basic amenities people. USA Brazil: Pffft! accommodation would endanger people, granted. Never! totally pown libs inevitably going sort spike soon NY/NJ cases things open NYC Monday....but gotta honest....from I've personally seen people wear masks. absolutely acceptions, Florida last month...NOBODY wearing masks all. saw honestly maybe total 20 people 1000s people mask public. sad, hard see dangerous spikes happening happening. direct approach limit airborne transmission pathogens inactivate within short time production. Germicidal ultraviolet light (UV), typically 254 nm, effective context, health hazard skin eyes. contrast, far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens without harm exposed human cells tissues. previously demonstrated 222-nm UV light efficiently kills airborne influenza virus (H1N1); extend far-UVC studies explore efficacy human coronaviruses subgroups alpha (HCoV-229E) beta (HCoV-OC43). found low doses of, respectively 1.7 1.2 mJ/cm2 inactivated 99.9% aerosolized alpha coronavirus 229E beta coronavirus OC43.

I think lot non-epidemiologists designing studies right now, say certainty intentional, there's reason scientific papers go peer review. talking corporation dude. give fuck anything except profits. first party line was, ""Fuck old, let die save economy, happy privilege"" ""Young people? cares, they're probably gonna fine. Young kids days never visit places sick, elderly, dying go..."" I've called. Also swagbucks prolific. article 9 days old. Recently also collapsed Natal, capital Rio Grande Norte state. You’re embarrassing yourself. People states require masks getting really sick wearing masks. worries. I'm spreading knowledge. ;) covid-19 ain't racist...treats colors same. Dining restaurants allowed see people timeline judging people would actually go dine in. point yes, theres still virus kinda see point opening cause people need money jobs. me, wanna dine feel normal help mental health? stuck home 4 months want outside. 

Is wrong do? Imagine restaurants lamps hanging table, emitting pleasant visible-spectrum light also killing coronavirus. Restaurants good targets people typically seated across cannot mask eating. someone works US university, trying work home much can. fall going total shit show. El tema es que tenemos suficientes tests para controlar el contagio. Estimo que en la próxima semana vamos volver al aislamiento total en BA por 2 3 semanas Shit. Arizona fully open. Little league baseball full swing, bars packed every night, jam packed house parties restaurants full nobody wearing masks distancing. Oh gosh. Whatever anybody says, lockdown work. Downvote hell, care, lack hospital capacity India alarming. Go awaaaayyy Donald Truummmpp Funsies. Instead people making bombastic claims forgetting one ever checking back it, actually come back check.

I think cases leading indicator hospitalizations, hospitalizations leading indicator deaths. Unfortunately Florida doesnt publish hospitalization data, states started seeing increase cases (where case % increase greater test % increase) 1-2 weeks ago seeing increase hospitalizations (Arizona, Texas, SC, NC), probably start seeing increase deaths soon, states already have. case Florida, huge increase cases far outpaced increase tests (hence, increase % positive rate), dont visibility hospitalizations since dont publish that, think ~2 weeks see flattening death curve uptick, 3-4 weeks it'll surpass current death levels. No. peer review exists. studies get press without peer review problematic. kind shit created antivaxers lead much confusion throughout pandemic. Man you’re dumb lmao even park beach long space you. hard...unless live densely populated area people cannot get 2sq themselves. joker right, seems  Except aren’t always “lied to” - sometimes comes science, given answer based known current time. answer changes future, doesn’t mean previous answer lie, answer given less information. 

There’s also difference exercising due diligence, saying “they wrong before, they’re wrong now, too” LOL  entirely states covid-19 response team decision. Guidelines set different phases phases, spikes seen state take step backwards phases. 

At point, imo, state(s) reopening businesses way relieve pressure economy. Unclear kind sign is. 

Also study recently came NEJM spured headlines suggests antibodies **asymptomatic** patients decline several months.

This important distinction antibodies symptomatic infection. unaware studies examining titers recovered symptomatic infections. work healthcare Texas cases definitely gone significantly cases primarily mild asymptomatic, whereas couple months ago severe cases happening. also previously seeing mostly middle aged becoming infected whereas seeing mostly 20s/30s. makes feel better, almost none docs work worried longer see much worse flu. think weeks cases level again. Well got weird. 

But going basically say thing. We've started letting 3 people home, masked. they're kids grandparents. thought 5 guests home right makes want panic attack. LMAO cousin lying, pharmacy would allow that. Call bs Chinese Korean don’t look anything alike, stop broadcasting ignorance. at? Raleigh Harris Teeter go filled people masks thankfully. “But first, removed previously confirmed cases testing pool”

Okay something would wanted make inaccurate study mislead people. Period. Today 180000 55000 Brazil 33000 US Wait Tulsa rally. I’m sure one wearing mask... Humanity? American think represent world something? Okay true, recall. Sweden horror story. escalating.

Sweden's daily deaths continue Hmmm, registering old Simpsons memory, pig? episode Lisa trying get everyone go vegetarian? Orlando going better masks month ago idk people decided could stop. Orange County Mayor mandated everyone must wear mask inside establishments (besides like first responders couple exceptions). students get many parts world. Intelligent compassionate leaders easily saw coming acted early Goddamnit hate state Hopefully read comments see this. I've seen articles study reposted ton, I'm sure thing everyone bringing next several weeks without understanding. Floribama Shore thing study, researchers linked dynamics spread people population-level models

Google empirical. pretty close unanimous point scientific community point. 

No borderline group think become political. academia time.

Regardless let's say right. Let's say masks slow it. what? still going kill whoever going kill. Cars kill people age group. I'm going wear cloth rag rest life. zero vaccines Corona viruses. us remember aids vaccine two years out. I'm done covid. Stay 6 ft me. I'm eating going bars. 

The 1918 pandemic mask use. ended killed infected everyone going infect. LOL  corollary right shoot gun right shot Well, *that seems normal* I'm guessing scenario outdoors private environment (backyard/patio) versus contained space central air? see that. I'm sorry. must frustrating. Depends you’re state anyone wants visit. E.g. Florida’s getting hosed gets lot tourism South Dakota probably protected ads ran everyone meth. Stay safe, appreciate healthcare workers. Yes think so. Maybe worse delays immune response. they're ones going more. Duh. tRump malignant narcissist. wholly incapable suggest. people like authoritarian power hungry. See there? That's get buying Wish.com Yeah that's plan, outside mask 6 feet distance idea trying say say survival fittest referencing situation I'm purely speaking ppls physical health. yes words put together sound great issue world helping others live good life grow population would great thing create society dependent money survive. instead population growth goid thing long run means ppl living poverty. Ah Swedish Approach that's hard work.

And no, thankfully, I'm USA. I've seen effects people eat ""around there"". legendary.

I'm glad wearing mask, even complaints it. wear mask cause cause want lol. wear mask anywhere u go (target, Walmart. Etc) however u wear one gyms. planet fitness many times packed..only one two people wear mask like 60. Good luck getting people wear mask school dorms house parties. .....what fantasy. I've shared two links evidence, done question credentials, insulted me, deemed worthy talking to.

You keep pretending high road debate anything, feel superior too.

I guess I'm set too. I'm generally curious much inter-state travel actually happens average person. Feels like almost never travel outside state, much reason except vacation. saying two risks there, one .5 chance killing average age victim 35, another one .5 chance killing average age victim 79, would consider former larger threat since higher chance stealing life me. would prefer live much life possible. Holy shit. think understandable fans sad loss fundamental part summers. definitely bigger economic social factors concerned with, loss baseball sports mental impact fans well. selfishly missing baseball also mean I'm discounting impacts virus, certainly case. North Korea COVID cases thus COVID deaths Tell people dead batteries. experts say week, say five, say battery starts breaking 3 days. battery DEAD three four days, that's stupid, preventing breakdown process starting. people get “tested asap” 2 week window infectious getting tested find out. Given right circumstances could easily spread free travel states proper cunt. Tell NY  Bernie unfortunately. know answer question, visit dad outdoors, risk greatly reduced. Probably many Fetal alcohol syndrome strongly represented groups well. US state. Three states joined. total disaster here. went got tested yesterday. I've wearing mask supposed do. bars restaurants packed last night concert country bar pretty busy. manager tell local news many people let in. Supposed 50% capacity enforcement. screwed. try next? light disinfectant body? don’t graduate Harvard you’re stupid.

Rich people get sorts things don't.

Tutors hired. Special test provisions possible sudden test anxiety. extreme cases, new building wing might purchased... state getting shitload cases like Arizona testing asymptomatic people 

Because think strain contact tracing 4000 people. test asymptomatic ones adds workload. Also wasting PPE. ratio 4-1. Shows challenging containing COVID going be, even best responses. Hopefully Tennessee gets sense News won’t tell anything hints improvement Trump president. narrative. Suddenly Trump loses November, COVID control race relations.

Sounds like boring life, throw mask bring hand sanitizer live life. Dont doom gloomer. Physician here. put COVID-19 death certificate, must positive COVID-19 test back up. can’t get certified cause death without supporting documentation. gets tricky test negative evidence support likely COVID-19 (the tests perfect). Again, put “suspected” “presumed” COVID-19, still needs evidence- CT scan, blood work etc support conclusions. partly takes long get number deaths counted. Medical Examiner reviews put question make sense. COVID-19 reportable disease, every positive test goes health demand CDC. can’t make stuff up. True. Super unlikely. maybe 5-10 executions good number. Right believe also use wet teracota pipes fan behind them. cool air due evaporation forms used dry climets also add humidity air or. Evapaeration condensing coils thing transferring refrigerant liquid gas also vise versa case heat pumps closed loop system. Geo thermal uses gound temps cool water closed loop system. 

These examples Air Conditioning systems. nutshell Meanwhile we’re fucked Arizona Exactly. Consistency messaging matters, changes need LOUD FREQUENT messaging. 

China went all-out educating people started lockdown back January. Big time. Information overload. constant feeding information. early Feb, everyone heard dozens (hundreds) times disease, spreads, prevent, etc. Making captive audience home certainly helped, pulled stops people get it. 

America, dribs drabs, inconsistent. It’s suggestion, it’s enforced. sign document telling it’s misdemeanor break quarantine. don’t actually know enforce that, think that’s point. literal scheme make people think they’re actually something Definitely outdoors. There's really excuse wanting give anyone ammo claim (rightfully so) campaign knows good idea. together masks much. important things avoid infection keep moving, washing hands, stop shaking hands, avoid places bad ventilation, change clothes (+ wash face regularly). Also happens half country won’t listen science kind instead nods agreement president tells bleach cure. everyone’s opinion outdoor dining? Restaurants opened outdoor dining (NJ) I’m still little apprehensive. happy complain it. body, clothing choices alarms people think magically young people starting get never bothering even test people age mid-may?

Shit almost always way Yes. use outside cloth part.

You want square around 22"". nothing worry folks. we've started testing. /s wouldn’t say nowhere near. hardest hit areas halfway there. ten times closer heard lockdown strategy places like Canada 

But people think herd immunity wrong way. switch turns hit certain number. Every extra immune individual slows spread little bit slows crawl. factors equal, population immune individuals slower spread one fewer. Unfortunately, studies indicate they’d fly 10% capacity even begin mitigate risks. See here: 

They would selling tickets loss. clear answer flights fix air ventilation aircraft. did. study doesnt even establish definitely long term effects *at all*, much less common degree.

You see wording right **limited evidence** long-term effects new coronavirus disease causes still months old, meaning **researchers able study disease's long-term effects people**. Joseph Brennan, cardiologist Yale School Medicine, experts worry **there may be** subset patients suffer long-term damage. 


So, significantly, study say ""There Covid patients proven suffer long-term effects"". first time went outside pandemic LA, maybe 1/3 people saw wearing masks, fucking infuriating. good friend. Unless name corn pop course will. expect anything less.

You’re probably seeing ethnic groups you’re used crowds, Oklahoma culturally southern you’re going see Scots Irish English people many areas country Oh gosh, misread! I’m sorry. That’s bummer. :( People underestimate huge US is. response pitiful say least, comparisons like make sense. likely community transmission NY even US' radar, mean even close spreading amongst whole country yet. likely long plateau, slight increase country past first wave. hospitalization rates looking?  traffic accidents minor. bother wearing seat belt. one beer road. drunk driving result accident. bs I'm discounting it. literally know person trying say.

Watching NY, good job Michigan 👏 Maybe they'll mask burning session show support ""infection number"" completely keyed number tests conducted? test zero people tomorrow zero new infections. 

Except despite increasing number tests, affected states percentage positives going down. going up. Likewise, hospitals ICU units get full increasing numbers tests performed. get full increasing numbers sick feel like deaths way concrete relevant

1. Maybe virus mutated less lethal strain. makes sense, reproduction difficult keep killing host quickly.

2. vulnerable populations already hit, gotten better protecting vulnerable populations. beginning pandemic, high amount deaths nursing home outbreaks.

3. Remember New York New York, like Europe built similar way, dense cities. right outbreaks happening southern states, shut pretty much super spreading events like sports concerts, spreading, fast nothing.

4. Despite people believe, people wearing masks practicing social distancing, degree. helps.

5. getting better treatment. love it. “personal responsibility”

That turned quite laugh though, it.

Yes, panhandle extension southern Alabama fucks goin - Michigan  Thank updating me. really wondering that. Crazy. Yay America, #1 again!!!! achieve herd immunity

You achieve herd immunity vaccinating majority people, letting get sick.

Sure, end letting virus run course population would achieve herd immunity survivors, yo contend with: much higher death toll necessary; significant portion population adversely effected damaged lungs, kidneys, permanent health ailments. agreed. paying attention, lied them. people got tired paying attention thats remember. mean, many times read ""I wear mask time... neighbor doesnt wear mask... do... people dont wear masks... wear mine, I'm smart they're dumb... look me, look me...

New Zealand completely eliminated it. South Korea test much faster sooner, established contact tracing much quicker etc. think they're gonna encouraged go get tested event. expect opposite.. Holy fuck I'm wondering Covid now. unfortunate situation last months recovering healing wound required weekly medical care, involved home healthcare hospital visits. took precautions however interacting them, wearing full mask goggles, gloves, wiping everything, sanitizing clothes, whole nine yards. 

Then week two crazy high BP levels like 160/80 even 175 180. also 4 straight days chest pain would let up. attributed either white coat syndrome have, fact taking antibiotics minor infections getting healing. 

I also take BP meds usually 130s happen meds extremely odd. also high risk I'm diabetic high BMI, existing lung scarring pulmonary embolism. really Covid, I'm lucky hell. taking vitamin supplements well multivitamins years, knows, maybe helped. wish knew not. Antibody tests unreliable. confirm. reports coming hospitals Florida fake news hoax? radiologist infectious disease doctors? gives knowledge doctors front line covid patients? many COVID-19 patients treated doctors? many people put ventilators? many people informed loved died COVID-19. work hospital danger someone would fool believe radiologist doctor doesn’t treats patients real doctors nurses front lines. feel cold.

Florida almost _4,000_ new cases yesterday. 90% recover less OK, dozen die, hundred lungs permanently fucked up, hundred various permanent disabilities (heart, kidney, etc).

Similarly Texas (4,500 new cases), CA, AZ, TN... pretty well every state.

Right now, plan keep going plan everyone exposed it, half percent Americans died, maybe 2% Americans disabled greater lesser extent.

In worlds, 5 million Americans dead injured. Makes WW2 look like walk park. least people position power saying it, I'll fucking take anything get point didn’t listen!

I’m adult late diagnosis I’m sure life ever normal antibiotics antivirals certainly help. Thanks. didn’t see 300k number there. miss extrapolating based data? Florida’s daily death rate basically stagnant 50 per day 

Yes, that's Florida re-opened, new case rate also stagnant. starting beginning June, new cases spike again. weeks, guys die deaths spike again.

[Check Florida averaging 800 new cases day June 1. Yesterday 3,822 new cases.

My guess two weeks, deaths around 200 day.

RemindMe! 2 weeks. Even Canada cant keep Americans out. Americans going Alaska (yea sure) dual citizens going cottages. Every death reopening completely preventable. can't stop every death.

Interesting, didn’t know Play tupid games, win tupid prizes

Fuck auto mod soon admit premature... Thank clarification. reason thought Tamiflu alternative approved year ago. I'm SE MI like 80%-90% wearing masks. Friends mine west/south Jackson Hillsdale though reporting masks rare sight. *accept keep testing this? work, there's evidence backs effective treatment.  Dun dun duhhhh.... Darker black track reason jump, contain local outbreaks everything's well. Unavoidable.

Berlin worry right now, rise seems mostly unrelated one outbreak. good believe yourself. American exceptionalism  *Insert GIF someone spitting drink here* don’t think talking people know positive Play stupid games, win stupid prizes going take decade... live one reopening countries. First reopening numbers really low, aka (I live Austria) 5-10 infections per day rate government also made clear enforce rules infection numbers rise. simply hammer phase dance phase. biggest mistake US atm reopen without numbers down, invitation eat buffet virus. PCR.

Only PCR tests actual active infection. take long, depending kind fairly high false negative.  contain cluster. R sensitive low cases. issue long cause cluster known. Every death reopening completely preventable. can't stop every death. better arent. evidence Spanish flu mutated deadlier strain. hypothesized death rate increased, could lot things. Wear live? true also depends state double, police keep half fine then, would abuse it... Four major localised outbreaks Germany:

1. increase 7-day incidence district Guetersloh due outbreak meat processing
plant. one thousand employees tested positive SARS-CoV-2.
2. outbreak Guetersloh linked outbreak Warendorf. Employees meat processing
company residents neighbouring districts.
3. Magdeburg, outbreak affecting several closed schools led increase 7-day
incidence.
4. Neukölln, district Berlin, outbreak linked members religious community. far 85 cases linked outbreak.

So multiple outbreaks known yes hopefully contained we? go school online totally fine. nice work full time go school full time take debt. That's insane. CA got tested hospital tent sent results less eight hours later (negative, record). BC Canada 20 daily cases day weeks (including several 10 new case days). one outside family house since March. Wonderful.

Also, still amazed Trump even think outdoors won’t last Maybe could care citizens lives job? 6 staffers setting rally test positive OMG We're same. Fuck anyone wear mask. It’s funny covid riots democratic cities opinion though. think disservice looking broader reasons Sweden failed.

It way hard find sources talk communes problems protective gear, tests etc. delayed. huge debate...hard miss it. 

I’ll end this: problems «minor» strategy kills 5-10 times neighbouring countries usually similar respondes/health etc. need look major flaws case. spot on, imo becoming unacceptable narrative. hate default Trump's.

Except relevant degree. happens sinking star. much attention last year, overrun covid blm. wonder find something area interest link new trends, go back school like others. hard laugh sheer stupidity whole dumbshit rally. Roughly 1000 people killed cops every year. honestly believe fewer 1000 Covid cases arise due protests? tell, still phase III testing approved basically anywhere Japan china, due concerns tetrogenic effects.

And china approved drug March flu Gotta remarket sinkhole houses! 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! One thing though: said statement cloth/surgical masks effective preventing wearer infection “lie”. suited preventing wearer spreading infection, protect wearer everyone wearing one. logically must offer protection inhaling aerosolized airborne droplets, main benefit prevent transmission. Please explain think lie.

It’s lie standard public health outbreaks always recommended wearing masks protection, even make-shift masks times proper PPE unavailable. course better masks better even tying cotton t-shirt around face offers nontrivial amount protection infection, transmission. None new information. Even people knew germ observed protective quality adopted it. outbreaks SARS MERs frontline responders couldn’t get proper PPE wore cotton masks, studied later found effective recommended various CDCs last resort. 

There’s something fishy departure theories founded first understanding botched initial mitigation strategy horrendously badly guilt leaned hope masks wouldn’t needed thought lies wouldn’t destructive. Maybe also rationalized could benefit protecting available supplies he’s resting excuse. doesn’t really explain total departure previous policies many public health agencies issue often appearance conspiracy explained simply people falling line first authoritative voice heard. It’s possible Fauci’s failure attributed but, regardless why, express information incorrect must know so. Hopefully bottles get nickel recycling. two three times deadlier flu. flu epidemics every couple years, math add up.

More people die due global downturn economy thanks populistic overblown measures die Covid-19. ""curve flattening"" opened testing sites see people less severely ill. can't believe still happening. realize he's killing people would otherwise vote him? Hang there. hope start feeling better soon New York City entering phase 2 Monday, believe Long Island already there. think allowed small gatherings outside transmission fairly rare. long measure social distance fine. considering big 3/4: nba/mlb/nfl/nhl Yeah.... live Michigan. think Covid heading V shaped recovery.

We well people anything anymore. think you’re right. didn’t March going would look like admitting made mistake. fluapalooza. covid party.... gonna last night long ""Person lied public masks criticising public following advice"" test covid already? Superspreader event incoming boys n girls ""Wear mask grandma die"" -reasonable people

""StOp AuThOrItArIaN"" -you fuck yeah know people there....and looks like theyre chances catching fuck greater ever...Fuck! wanted! 

Good luck man don’t wind hospitalized it’ll affirm belief whole thing “fake news”... say every single person made choice ""unnecessary reason""?

It known risk, yes. people know that. known way lower risk? Also yes. implement way lower risk can?

Especially since personally getting infected effect you, many others well. public health perspective, generally attempting contain disease observable. 99.5% sure Florida one could predicted *cries Arizonan* watched Facebook lives Tulsa... science. Texas couple drove ""Texans Trump"" signs. problem New York City offices reopening.

I think valid concern. Many employees less 6' spacing co-workers many buildings modern air circulation filtration (let alone actual windows).

But, value NYC 'network effect'. everyone work home, reasons NYC. So, BDB / Cuomo really want get people back offices businesses start leaving tax impact everyone *could* WFH leaving catastrophic.

The best fix 'cure' COVID vaccine, failing I'm sure cloistering employees 3'x3' transparent plastic bubbles workable, know unpleasant. worried bad racist satire, remember hicks every country. Yep. Super dammit. could seen coming? Georgia +1800! went COVID feral. person needs

Many people believe *need* decent education. Insanely high relative (I europe) count everyone wills talent get proper education longer illness might cost job bankrupt top it. Wind &amp; elements fear... might mess ""hair"" disturb makeup effect. (this would like outside white house press conferences--less control) say that. point ability automate mindless jobs anyways that's one many issues, population goes jobs available go cost living goes up..it's balance. need automate everything give ppl basic universal income let rest passion particular field make due education luck greed. schools reopen fall

Then delay education.

“The North Britons brought ancient border habit belligerence toward ethnic groups.” Whats point? accept 1000 murders 1000 may get Covid due protests? Glad that's cleared up! understand Europe decided strain came Australia likely going float around rest lives... safe effective universal vaccine stains virus going found. 600 mutations month ago. going get 600 vaccines? [Here's rather depressing article international travel future.] doctor know told me, “there lot educated idiots.” blame protests. people seriously call “Northern Michigan”? Jared spreads stuff cause dirty little bird. Anti-science. Louis Pasteur must crying grave. media taught us gloves give false sense security. true didn’t teach anyone wear gloves properly would helped everything. 

I wear everyday know safely. mask gives us false sense security media taught everyone wear mask stop virus. Still full proof keep touching mask virus gets go right still get you. gloves cant get skin removed. Yes gloves second skin point. safely removed virus secured them. 

When mask shortage cdc said don’t wear don’t help. caught masks said help people believed it. 

When shortage gloves happened glove trend started. wouldn’t dare touch shopping cart public surface bare handed don’t care much sanitizer used it. someone else touched hasn’t washed hands it’s contaminate. 

People also touch face without gloves even though media says it’s way around. told everyone next day gloves worked everyone would jump start using again. I'm aware. protect COVID-19 handed supporters enter safety barricade President Donald Trump's campaign rally Tulsa. MIKE SIMONS/Tulsa Word

So one hand they're trying, feel like people take explicitly throw away one else use them. afterward Life can, should, get back normal point, time now, students trust universities keep safe. University responses woefully inadequate. COVID dorms? Relying upon students check temperatures daily? Limiting roommates? None measures enough, bringing thousands students onto campus, students stay campus, go night weekends, reckless. Maybe worded completely wrong. meant numbers exaggerated based number reasons:

-Adding antibodies positive tests
-Harvesting cases week old 
-placing several days build one two days
-FOCUSING hot spots (contact tracing FL doing)
-Focusing testing communities positive tests come (what FL also doing)
-Suspected cases

The bottom line increase cases worst thing long hospitalizations deaths spiking (which they’re not). learn live virus realize every increase/“spike” cases means world ending state trouble don’t know true data behind it. burning cool reflux, try sleeping wedge pillows prop bad handshaking. Hugs kisses would even better. Scientist need rally supply test case. test case like already occurred South Korea Shincheonji Church Jesus met. Thousands people indoors mitigation. One attendee gave nearly 40 others. within week half people infected. 

""In Busan, 61-year-old Daegu resident believed spread virus. 20 February 2020, 53 new cases Shincheonji attendees families, reaching 300 23 February, half cases South Korea. additional 4,000 cases COVID-19 within two weeks, roughly 60% total infections nationwide stemmed viral load curve infection Tulsa **already worse** South Korea time event.

I'd think would restrictions liquor stores that'd make much sense.  Miller tried Juneteenth!  almost taxes necessary evil keep society running ""StEaLiNg"".

Actually Europe way higher taxes average income, stealing also necessary evil, simply necessity keep society running applied well keeps social unrest away. always means collect taxes sanely, people need see money give spent well towards functioning society. DeSantis clearly depth. realize retirees pump huge amounts tax dollars Florida economy? Lobbyists work political realm, yeah  know since mask wearing social distancing thought people get lads! thing is, US government (and profit companies willing pay mobile provider) power (tracking cell phone location variety purposes) years, app necessary. 

Heck, even IRS uses data: give government power

That would great fight back late 1980s early 1990s. genie bottle roughly 30 years now. going throw ziplock bags full human shit trash? state mind, really. could start slowly open now. virus would gone would definitely back normal.

...but would still much better now, obviously anybody confident accuracy tests? responsibility serve food isnt spoiled? drinkable water without chemicals it? functioning bathroom?

If someone next literally shitting pants, spitting, throwing everywhere, would absolutely responsibility anything long get destination? Would ""fault"" chose fly?

No, course not.

Are risks flying? kind public transportation? course. cant litigate way perfection safety. can't achieve doesnt mean responsibilities fuck we'll wing it. It’s India. two consecutive posts one bringing politics. ""world"" applies USA? got bad wave early on, mean they’ve largely reached herd immunity? going biggest super spreader event far US absolute clusterfuck.

And yet laugh point. Same. Leaving two weeks two week road trip planned destinations except cabin. that, well plan days ahead find safest/best options camping whatever.

Starting Minnesota, we'll probably avoid states south us, seem worse off. trip Dakotas maybe far west Glacier national park looking likely. Yes 
But hrc biggest donor buy onion shut everyone able going go get tested?

Tests widely available area people don’t seem going. become mandatory people start going? contrary, [we've seen around following basic protocols epidemics humans known century extremely effective.

Your argument this: ""Epidemiology hard, therefore almost nothing prevent spread virus best move."" One hundred thousand unnecessary corpses might disagree you. spend amount time see Packer stuff. Shit, assuming trump's audience oklahoma young people..lol teacher currently work mental health. many kids recipe sorts issues. Read said again, slowly.

""I fear...""
""Because fact...""

Do know fears facts? Obama coronavirus opposed idea wearing masks needed/required simply see harm wearing one. However, completely disagree approach employer taking. Requiring everyone wear masks complete jobs home. working home past 3 months seem first ones area want everyone back office. said visit people desks instead call email them. So, exactly want people back office potentially expose everybody? happy right now. Best thing keep rallying then... expect DeSantis issue mask order, right one immediate family members actually dies. 

He could save grief. could save lot us grief. guy could literally say ""water wet"" sub would upvote it. family going eat father's day, way around it. stay safe possible?  found aunt Covid 19. Someone took care kid. honestly can’t even think straight right now. lot better swear I'm gonna run shocked reaction gifs rate. I’m super curious actual numbers be. compare protests. Demographics protests vs rallies. Generally assume large gatherings relatively young healthy people much better large gatherings seemingly unhealthy older individuals. MSM obviously make worse thing that’s ever happened world. current plan. already setup contract NBA. infection gets bad (it will), unclear do. “People aren’t hospitalized though!” 

(Once people hospitalized)

“People aren’t dying though!” 

(Once people start dying)

“They’re dying things!!”

This keep going someone know critically ill dies. 

The lack abstract thought empathy kill thousands. bolsonaro trump simp, pathetic. think USA back exponential growth since days Beaches low risk spread. There’s reason keep outdoor recreation closed think it’s going go full force denial/protest blaming Florida facing tsunami.. Arizona; people going refuse wear them, because, ""Muh rights!"" hear isn’t issue about. Live fl.

Fl wet pavements, humid, sun showers, old people driving. 

24 / 7 app could prevent track COVID areas. Yeah mostly central Florida beaches seems like. every state. smart ones. answer question. know mask usage save lives. Maryland might look great, Florida seen record numbers everyday. Masks testing work long people gatherings beach, clubs bars. people US would actually stayed home like Italy, France others current numbers covid cases would 10 times smallers. lock someone home America? People ""too free"" tell something. good dude! feel like needs ELI5 understand COVID far. going attempt here: know solve housing. know solve job risks. know provide social distancing choose US care people.

I’m sure massive problems known, obvious achievable/realistic solution. 

Rather shrugging saying US doesn’t care people, isn’t possible really complex issues tough solve balancing issues? Defaulting “the US doesn’t care” feels really simplistic. Germany face mask mandatory quite time. course it’s sometimes fun wearing them, infection rates seem fine. virus can't survive cigarette smoke. Tulsa ICUs problem here. people getting planes, flying home, trying refuse wear masks...

Frankly, local community spread likely negligible event compared it'll spread far wide across country. thumbs. Good job guys, urban NC, see side. I’m pointing people take definitive stands medical treatments without knowledge medical experience. 
Sorry trying put words mouth feel like needs ELI5 currently think covid works, understanding impacts treatment plan methods. attempt ELI5:

We break COVID two phases: early late. Early initially infected show symptoms. Currently, think COVID able downregulate body's immune response allows replicate spread without body noticing (hence show many early symptoms). 

Eventually, point COVID replicates enough gets enough places (lungs, kidneys, small vessels) body finally able recognize something going on. immune system kicks generalized symptoms begin appear (fever, chills, muscle aches, fatigue). problem people get fever immediately assume COVID (which understandable, TONS things cause fever). body's immune system goes little crazy start seeing symptoms like shortness breath. probably people wind going ER, point virus already done much set do. true killer body overreacting actually notices virus able get many different places body. immune system picks up, ends causing self-harm good (kidney failure, lungs filling fluid, liver damage, blood clots). things caused body's defense mechanism. 

So-- HCQ working? Well, problem antiviral. give patients already phase two, tackling root problem! Sure, preventing virus continuing multiply, immune system already fighting back point (and causing TON damage process). mention, HCQ risky given patients kidney injury, needs kidneys order get excreted blood. much builds up, cause serious complications (most notably heart toxicity/arrhythmias). See problem here? Patients coming ER bad symptoms probably ALREADY sort kidney injury, want throw drug risky kidneys working 100%? seems like common sense would dangerous game playing. know. Great- Florida gets host RNC 50k COVID deniers running amuck Jacksonville. Fucking irresponsible. China: OH no, hundred new cases? Time lock residents apartments order save everyone.

The US, 20,000 new cases every day: thinking mandating masks right infect everyone town want to. dont Ireland TTI program: doesn’t prevent virus, helps mitigate risk severe case

First time I've heard this. cite studies data? tf Georgia going crazy reopening seeing many cases don’t many retirees Florida does? Could make road trip? Nope. Ulster, province, includes Donegal, Cavan Monaghan. Northern Ireland Ulster, include counties. Pretty sure saying shutting flights would remotely sufficient address situation. Trump said nothing winter. incapable admitting wrong. base incapable disagreeing him. I'd say real issue man dying, sure. Shhh, waste breath mate isn’t entirely true MI. lot kept hospitals. ones sent continuing care homes separate buildings/wards anyone sick. never commingled. Please don’t spread mistruth. agreed, disagree message backl then, becaue international studies done (not US funded). bought masks China took 5 weeks arrive people either laughed got mad wore early April told government lying. right.

Things changed lot since March. That's understandable. passing by, around eating drinking masks, social distancing. Containing virus means R effectively less 1. Adding infected people changing constant rather changing exponential Arizona casino community transmitted cases stay Arizona, many cases transmitted Las Vegas infected individual return back home state. going hard determine much transmission actual happening there. AZ counties responsible contact tracing. doubt counties work much states counties share information, big cluster F, doubt processes place so.  city? I'm midtown I'd say 80% people really strict masks/social distancing, 15% people half-ass maybe 5% people give fuck. True. county network doctors (about 40- half non-hospital doctors small county) bought order stay business year ago. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* 24 community spread cases today.Not lot world numbers little spot fires daily double digits community cases last week mostly .The rest country great ,here Western Australia 2 active cases .We never get zero active cases regular flights bringing citizens back overseas isolated two weeks tested. Well judging happened influenza, mutated became deadly know coronavirus same. think thats generally true viruses.

As far shutdowns concerned, think least 6 weeks hard shutdown drive virus extinction. Along high quality contact tracing. hurt, thats believe. JFK said ""We things easy, hard."" 

Again, believe hospitals everywhere gonna become flooded covid patients. means car accident victims, heart attack victims, recieve care doctors slammed people die. choice shutdown. didn’t even PPE.

There's still problem PPE (also doctors horrible, horrible problem, add overall death totals Jun 17, N95 mask shortage? It’s still supply chain problem can’t compare now. Things full, patients dying': 3 Alabama counties see largest jump weekly 17, 2020, 7:22 AM

That problem here, now. new cases apparently younger people.

Many cases back young people well. info changed bunch? thing anybody able give single quote lying DeSantis. 

Moreover, reason believe that, unlike before, transmission young old? Agreed. majority grandma's comment sound like words. called sheep said ""follow cliff"" referring Whitmer. country developed world chose stuck herd immunity policy.

Belarus also chose route. They've 343 deaths.  Michigan still cases/deaths per capita overall Florida Arizona. could definitely change, Michigan one hardest hit early states. explanation complex ""we locked right, didnt."" Gavin Newsom made $1B deal chinese manufacturer make masks. Less 2 months later made mandatory wear masks. 🤷🏽‍♂️ U.S apparently don’t virus anymore. Everyone jammed places movie theaters aren’t even requiring masks now. Apparently it’s issue anymore. way look better?

All results terrible getring worse worse.  really depends airline. great experience Delta. required masks blocked middle seats flight. still risk course make sure get tested soon able. live Michigan supposed move NYC job. makes happy. Funny someone downvoted lol, got 👍 fairly conservative family member yesterday told “most cases nursing homes, they’re bringing virus nursing homes make trump look bad”. 

Despite second bit utter nonsense (who they, wonder?) true first part, “most” covid cases nursing homes? quick google search shows 1 4 deaths nursing homes cases? Arizona, Georgia, Alabama Missouri Obama administration left playbook steps take early threat pandemic, Trump administration scrapped de-funded department deal it. ACA didn’t hit primary providers nearly badly hit hospitals. lockdown closed practices. Argue fewer primary providers good thing want, it’s clear likely result many deaths coronavirus alone. thought guys smart enough need it. Guess gave much credit. number reported Saturday usually highest number week Florida. Sunday Monday low numbers represent tests processed weekend labs running full capacity. Yes, remember pandemic response readiness biggest focus Clinton-Trump debates 2016. Look, get it, leaders ready let's play revisionist history try claim people's biggest political issue year ago. sacrifice he's willing make. Yup, hope hit hard trouble access medical care downtown Seattle? I’m Belltown everything feels controlled. places seating it’s nothing packed control.

It sounds like local. US profit motive medical system. need single payer/Medicare all. would cheaper safer citizens. INDOOR. INDOOR. INDOOR. INDOOR. INDOOR

See said multiple times might able pierce skull. Cannot confirm. grandparents sides live literally five minutes used live Florida, suburb, retiree community.

Plenty old people too, grandfathers tired crazy like hang old buddies proclamation actually says wear face coverings.... opens wide range options. lost sense taste covid &amp; yet get back?! Yes, definitely. Germans particular image Sweden quite shaken according article: sad thing many people would regain lot respect Sweden outright said ""ok, messed up. bad, we're going fix systemic problems caused it. worry, we're planning fixing mistake taking x, y, z actions"" actually perform actions. 

I think going get actions, yeah doubt we're going get mea culpa. Nobody gives shit WHO, Chinese succubus. staying way *targeted*, smart implementation TTI. 

Ireland come lockdown without TTI system place. Yet numbers increasing. nothing TTI. That’s great point. it’s likely vast majority people complaining loss sports lamenting economic impact regular people, lamenting loss entertainment themselves. rest Europe reopened month ago. *yes, bad time cop murder black man* Coworkers. work airline fixing planes tons guys right wing. No, like saying ""I use condoms every time"". 

You fearful seem understand viral transmission all. 

There cases something better nothing. one cases. 

Bye bye now. drive upstate New York mid-pandemic. rest stops problem really. may changed food stops reopening.

Wear mask, use elbows push handicap buttons doors instead opening normally, wash hands every pit stop. Stock snacks drive buy stuff stops. Take roll paper towels use one fill gas push buttons grab pump. also get EZ pass go deal tolls. steps followed. Positive cases steady many weeks rise. 3-4 week lag cases deaths, I’d expect start seeing modest rise toward end coming week. lol know it’s absurd. NY, NJ, apparently MI order anyone lands self quarantine 2 weeks got together. tables turned. Florida behind times. mean pepper spraying people causing cough vomit excessively isn’t safe pandemic??? Never said that. Michigan also got nailed pretty hard. highest cases/deaths per capita country. NY, NJ, MA. makes sense decline places. states getting turn. How? whole Northeast great trajectory. hit hardest beginning everyone took seriously. part, everyone still mostly isolating wearing masks helps ton! keep we're doing, things could lot better parts country fall.

I live NH really care Gov Sununu COVID, really taking seriously week implemented program encourage everyone state get tested drive thru testing sites accurately track Asymptomatic carriers. I'm going get tested today! Yes, mostly rescind stay home order point. believe still restrictions businesses, mean state given up. dont think hard decision federal requirement face masks would great right now. setting disaster many places.  100%. Deaths increase 2-4 weeks later. Deaths getting lockdown 4 weeks ago. doesn’t prevent virus, helps mitigate risk severe case... people start dropping like flies FL TX make judgement, far hasn’t happened early surge. 

I would hazard guess Brazil doesn’t nearly level healthcare infrastructure US handle this, large, vulnerable, low income population live close proximity. combined probably cause lot excess mortality, much like NYC hospitals overflowed. general people say Latino Latino/Latina like 1/2 population excluding small amount. Northern BC here. rarely see them, hospitals medical clinics. population, density, reported cases course significantly lower, I'm worried completely relaxing inevitably lead outbreaks. No, white  mother fucks son strap Takes least week two see significant difference masks even implemented mitigation measures. So, think see difference, it’s going immediate masks alone aren’t going solution quiet acknowledgment it’s farted.

But, clear, *did* fart. Yep... I'm feeling bad extroverts... internally Snoopy happy dance I'm told woke thing do. I'm suggesting plan better NBA MLB still gaping hole miss rona find way go cruise stops there. Oh wait... So, guess Flordia hot zone now? Governor Dipshit it! I'm supposed spend 4th Torch Lake. still learning going could cancel, hope return. rude. It’s almost global pandemic doesn’t care people get play/watch sports. live Mesa, AZ masks required public now. I'm fixed income yet able purchase masks. supposed go grocery shopping laundromat can't afford buy mask? online find stock? I've tried Walmart they've stock since beginning. access sewing stuff can't make one either. Yeah understand all. seem think ""we're never going completely eradicate virus open everything things go back normal!"" Im suburbs Grand Rapids see maybe 10% people masks on. Worrying say least. Also, compare Sweden worst mitigates failure. Many countries extremely successful lockdowns.

Sure. say countries also successful ""non-lockdowns"" (ie Japan). put ""gold standard""? Reason: makes lockdown countries feel like government made bad call.  Gee, almost like early something like ...

... good luck NBA, bringing teams infection epicenter ... live Orange County. local drive testing center people line get tested starting 4am, also four hour waiting time get nasal swab test maybe five hours waiting time antibody test (which reached capacity remainder day midmorning). I’m glad county tried put heavy emphasis dire need everyone adhere wearing mask social distancing. They’ve put orders place mandatory mask usage public, aren’t really enforcing deem unnecessary. want people common good. isn’t happening across board. There’s many people crying freedom, unconstitutional, hyped fear-mongering media. There’s complete lack common sense decency lot people. become politicized past point caring others. I’m sure we’ll see numbers coming anytime soon without either major rules enforced change behavior think joke. Sounds like something parents would definitely happening - two husband's coworkers family members contacted contact person later tested positive (this Colorado). Whether enough effective another question. know actual numbers figured much. Michigan definitely California though. California could probably become nation wanted to. Absolutely play anyone's experiences covid-19, similar period recovery nasty flu cought 2011. 20 years old, healthy, active, flu took temperature 39 five days. recovering severe chronic fatigue syndrome six months minor chronic fatigue/adrenal insufficiency blood sugar anomalies two years afterwards.

I fully recovered stage barely remember life ever bad. offer kind consolation, happens viruses full recovery definitely possible.

Best hope everyone's quick recovery. people say “too late get tested” mean? ideal time symptoms start get tested accurate result? Full HAZMAT would protect us virus even better... reason get downvoted suggesting here. 

But also get downvoted simply saying wear mask gloat online.. So... Also highest testing day sucks. Hope quarantine return. bad bere think Arizona, Florida, Texas tough time. frustrates hell me: false dichotomy fear denial. Absurd choice. Wear mask afraid. Near lutz So, immune system used vitamin fight infections. People deplete sick. 

There still big question regarding whether causation correlation. 

Moreover, people get lot vitamin food, sun, especially true many darker-skinned people getting disproportionately hit hard virus (so sun important regarding vitamin D). 

Finally, many people hot environments actually spend time indoors summer air conditioning. 

There really good data showing saying, good reasons believe case. corps partnerships pass thru entities. entities don’t pay income tax, individual owners do. C corps pay income tax entities. said Florida income tax get revenues taxes.  case recently news ? Parents buying kids schools... backlog think safe say ""summer wipe shit out"" theory good dead.

Please, Indian large majority post history Indian propaganda lmao It’s super mediocre paper authors backed people overinterpreting it. 

“Empirical evidence X possibly occurs” good place argue from. paper doesn’t support hypothesis, stop citing it, find something better support. 

Good luck research. bad giant cheeto coming Marinette Marine week.. Tell better call local medical school clue in. Maybe call NASA hot tips rocketry they're it. Reasonable. Everybody talking round 2..

Breaking news- Sacramento sheriff inexplicably thinks Americans care happens Sacramento Today's 4k positive 12% positive rate? wait, Florida got plan? That's I'm thinking. Pretty bad popular still, Sweden’s many critics hounded Swedish troll brigade, near 50 Swedes still support it. Sadly, media covered well asked critical questions.

But better solution going make next decade, im ears. Sheriff (probably): “Don’t worry folks. won’t enforce it.” iirc highest South Carolina. Nationwide? clue, I'm sure states worse, much I'd wager. US 27 million tests, Brazil 2.4 million, wow that’s almost 50% positive rate whole country right? article literally states young people getting tested before. 

There's good evidence showing demographics getting infected different.  one going bring soon former guy charge US? international scope, Florida floridaing could affect US tourists allowed abroad again. Aside economy damage, would caused extreme amount social damage.

Did someone besides Cuomo? Trump avoid catching COVID-19 people seemingly affected even smallest unprotected interactions? never wears mask, seems constantly surrounded people (eg events like this), isn’t exactly age group physical shape that’s forgiving What.  Actually deaths downward trend upward. heart breaks America this, really. early days much gas lighting administration unscientific nonsense, deliberately misleading, hard feign surprise people seem live bubbles ""reality whatever choose be"". Like objective truth simply more.

It seems incredibly sad year people feel well aligned with. context, Feb 27 told [pandemic March 10, raged Trump retweeting critical moments whole crisis, utterly bungled science/logic denial. juxtaposition preparations [making propaganda coming US (and readily shared domestically), really mind-boggling.

Sorry, mean provide bit worldly context. Sitting MacDonald's breakfast, someone comes around wanting details contact tracing, every table closed - again, 2 cases state, hotels.

America instantly forgiven making choice turn once. make mistakes. hope country [doesn't double it, better days far now. Make good choices :( yea realized posted it. figured id leave up. added ""within reason"" part try make understandable people reading post. least see peoples reasoning wearing mask.

I realized posted, probly replied first comment chain comments instead yours.

No offense taken. know right. feel terrible every time hear coworkers complaining wearing mask. however searching asthma friendly mask. swear one point heard mask made specifically asthmatics. suffer woefully miscalibrated understanding virus risk many younger patients survive mean require hospital resources, they're better responding treatment less likely ultimately succumb. sufficient overcrowding hospitals reduced treatment per admitted patient, mortality would go across board. uses 24 years government service proof honesty? true, lie bottom sea long enough eyes move upward-facing side head. visited NZ virus, generally wonderful place regardless time although maybe ever. Lucky live place literally community transmission state borders closed. Can’t fathom guys dealing I’m psychologist make I’m lend ear need. lead depression

Well, almost certainly period recession, possibility getting flu

Death. issue hand death, even question if, many. current number stands shy half million worldwide climbing. keep number within general ballpark now, ignore problem increase dramatically. Think happen people start opting things can't mask - going gym, bars, restaurants, college classes, theaters. cities die out.

Cities ""die out"" quarantine. case, US would folded several times over, especially IRL people want pretend walking around mask normal.

True that. want pretend normal. want acknowledge reality I'm part prevent spread deadly disease.

Your lack basic human empathy compelling. truth common sense probably never existed. We've awful forever Common sense ain't common right here. Mask make problem seem visible election year. That's why. 4 years??? could know Pat building support Charlotte for-profit campaign guised daily talk show. use no-script disable javascript enabled couple sources try read comments.

Shhhhhhhh.... People Reddit smarter that

🤣😂🤣😂 I'm reminded Graduate. ~~Milk &amp; Cookies~~ Milf &amp; Cougars. stop wearing masks 

Merica number 1 Yeah id say face masks still great idea, especially something breathable like new nylon things they're selling now, blocking droplets spraying still want exposed various microbes keep healthy micro-biome whatever. need keep immune system strong. need get sunlight literally lock dark rooms 24/7 something majority humans much dangerous flu based certain genetics factors, least fatality sense, yeah might get sicker flu would give come nowhere near death.
Remember end tons people dead human intervention/unintended consequences terrifying, really sure shutting economy like lead drastic consequences?Similar black plague hit everyone thought demonic cats causing killed cats could find end plague good!without literally one worlds best alpha predators rodent poulation exploded spreading fleas everywhere grim reaper laughed stupidity, hopefully unintended consequences drastic intelligence save us. better damned sure know we're doing. Since wearing mask make activist. I’m conservative, guy moron. It’s literally big deal. thing you’re protecting people might need it. 

Wearing bitches glasses sucks. really matter think. matters facts, show countries wear far less contagion countries resistant them. ""you think useless"" make so. Hospitals US never overwhelmed, though. 

There is, however, lot evidence heart attack stroke victim numbers dropped (by like 40-60%). people recover home. Everybody clustered inside breathing other. Michigan really seemed get act together. numbers looking real good now. - Illinois No, I'm mocking something else.   10 years vr like ready player one, see I'm talking about. he'd moody. empirical evidence don’t? would interesting read article legitimately proves wearing masks work prevent spread Covid-19. Serious question - one? really no, also say contradicting confusing stuff, give information needed. give credit. would say significant driver. young person, Instagram feed filled millennials bars restaurants distancing masks. 

Also, videos working together dumb shit like high five pushups (touching other), hugging, playing basketball together. gathering precautions.

If wondering area I've observed in: DC DC suburbs. southern midwestern state. heard first folks1

/u/fagstick123 personally know anyone suffering Coronavirus.

Pandemic over! He's know taken consideration people running polls wonder reflects population. I'm younger know anybody answers phone calls random numbers, parents many older people know do.   Damn, going start seeing 1000 day again? Yeah, unfortunately indeed... depend person's symptoms are. friends symptoms headaches fever, could done take Advil Tylenol require prescription, need doctor's visit aside paperwork. know work, I'm U.S. lot hoops jump get work long period time. matter sick/hurt with, work much matter unfair illegal people claim is. Getting work done making money much important lot places health employees. Again: actually get infected, (only) approx 4-5% die.  


Is 1 20 enough change minds? kidding me? using unsourced tweet proof? 

Wow, must new interwebs. bad, thought speaking adult. Ask parents sourcing, rather -- ask mom sourcing, I'm busy explain you. Yes, freedoom....errr freedom..... one group's activities unmasked participating individuals personal pleasure/enjoyment/fun pretending pandemic, masked groups initially standing rights one fellow citizens longer someone knelt neck nearly 9 minutes? ex police officer... departments states give lot leeway officers enforced ordinance even misdemeanor. problem see officers seeing direct threat people around unmasked person... direct threat choice officer act removed them, must act. 

As clear me, anyone unmasked close quarters public space threat everyone around them, choice ACT. Good luck convincing educated often way young police force get board though. then, best all, Sir Isaac Newton gets born blows everyone's nips big brains. cowardice. pandering Trump. 

He complete 180 stance towards virus (previously claimed he'd let science data drive decisions) second Trump left state visit. I'm willing bet tone changed drastically chance visit. joking right? clue downvoted... temperature fever going eradicate virus shit. What? Bro, idea even saying. I'm physician #1, #2 covid patients treated nurses, RTs, Rad, labs, etc, idea talking neither you. talkingout ass right now. Stop acting lime yo idea goes hospital guy said, Indians spreading coron country, even said Indian strain deadly. heart rate goes think 15 20 beats per minute per degree temperature fever goes up. guess we'll governed feelings thing. Might good idea take break computer time time. That's think too. virus scary people fearful. wearing mask way telling real. reality scary. people complying there, maybe small area, they're definitely minority here. Hopefully unfortunate luck going groceries time people caring anymore. 

Lets hope best. evidence ""lifelong respiratory problems"" common might ..? issue, blocked all. feed hate ignorance free! need new friends replace old one, DM :) mean riots massive looting stores all
Across US wasn’t test case ?  Weird.  Tomato TomAto politician lying? I'm waiting story couple months Trump campaign paying rent rally venue. This... would match better, would still small state advantage, winner-take-all method states affirming EC vote means narrow victory one state different landslide another. theory, candidate win electoral college 23% popular vote. number electors one part reason. live see people complying. sure :)  another nearby small town fundraiser pop-up drive in. would make old.

You're old me. also damage internal organs kidneys, heart, pancreas, and... extra blood clots, damage brain. EXACTLY I'm worried most.

This event (and, God help us, others decides try do) going result huge increase positive cases way beyond cities actually held. Well, good thing I'm then! Yeah? Please indicate sources masks really mean shit. I'll call want to. guys giving meds people probably need lost protection virus. funny say that's county like said I'm experiencing total lack care stay home orders lifted. surprising seems regional. North East, relatively good. Retail stores require enforce mostly. I'd like see little outside parks risk lower outside general. sign compassion??? wear mask protect getting infected even feel 'safe' bc everytime get back home think got it. Forget locking again, Governor DeSantis wont even mandate masks enclosed spaces. blame internet media. Restaurants bars literally places problematic...even half time could wearing mask. Feel workers industries tey critical maintaining economy. Preventing spread keep open businesses critical economy care, price. Let's say masks slow it. what? still going kill whoever going kill.

So stay 6 feet away people? logic, you’re going catch eventually, aren’t you? gotta gotta do. virus there, cases rise places initially started low reopened thinking control. 

best keep trucking fet vaccine proof. erectile dysfunction?
Strokes?
Kidney failure?
CFS?
Blindness?
Clots?


This respiratory illness. Stop pretending is. know masks effective

you dumbasses adults children grown old. It’s optional grow up. true agree w u Sure, die year. Unfortunately, around 400 ultra rich people decided case. ^ imagine rooting fellow countrymen die disease share politics honestly says lot general populace. People North Carolina wearing masks all, although almost every business ""requires mask social distancing,"" see one maybe two people actually complying that. Good luck staying quarantine years lol Brazilia!! Fuvk yeah!! Sad state things pointing cruises pollute considered political issue. physiological hard work working 30-40 celcious degrees. top overweight like horrible hard breathe. That’s nonsense COVID cause heart attacks. attacks whole body. handful anecdotal cases piano lands COVID-positive person that’s inaccurately counted, every case like several people died COVID tested therefore aren’t counted.

Arguing otherwise different saying U.S. combat death tallies skewed we’re unfairly assuming soldiers wouldn’t gone cardiac arrest anyway without first shot.  literally anything India works, market stalls nuclear plants.

The last time tried buy leather shoes shop Delhi, guy took pair small away brought back thought next size up. damp, still snug smelled funny. turned dunked shoes bowl diesel stretch out. What’s confusing area still people don’t realize mobile phone company already sells location data private enterprises several levels government.   Oakland County folks seem comply, assuming due proper education pretty mild politically complain like toddler. grand scheme things, sure, say objectively beneficial things happen world less ignorant people it.

But I'm going sit tell someone directly ""hey good thing friends struggling gonna die. That's awesome!""

Its unnecessary me. insane read. person's family dangerously stupid. brought air conditioner room, unplugged ventilator could plug air conditioner.... attacked hospital staff died it.

Imagine fucking stupid kill family member attack people trying save want feel warm. southern roots Ocala family would travel kid, got huge culture shock coming hood Philadelphia... like late 80s. nurses provided simple cloth masks?  weird I'm still self quarantining myself? really number mentally since I'm alone recently late mother's house apply jobs. primary caretaker home hospice, dog. may narrative! course, wrong; instead, people dont like truth told. yeah. tragic part. wont mean shit employees/family/friendss,etc get covid19 diagnosis, eyes turn saucers pants wet piss....

sucks apparently seem think know better scientists. would someone like even speak? know young watch movies KNOW yoi protagonist... life isnt computer game little kid think sign anything wanting protect ourselves. masks kind statement care health around.  wear mask moron. Ezpz make choice. Florida restrictions, came phase 2. means retail operate 100 percent capacity. free retail, seeing results. glad chain work decided take step back still keep restrictions place. Yep day one ""political"" friends post stupid city lives mandatory public face mask ordinance. Surgical n95 masks reduced pre-covid respiratory illness 41% influenza-like illness 66% healthcare workers. send sources scientific consensus mandating public wear reusable cloth masks reduces covid spread significant percentage? think want sharia law,

Who 'they' scenario mask thing part religion conformity thought

Can elaborate point? better admit people confirmed negative test reports...

Yeah...like happen

Not worried potus...because keep well away crowd...

And seriously worried potus...

But crowded indoor amphitheater hope one dont spread it. 

Any statisticians care take stab odds? logical fallacy keep saying virus fake someone know catches bad case it. ^ imagine hateful would deny aid based political affiliation. How? get information rest us somehow access to? lol americans need treated like fucking babies think wearing masks cool done. failure US society is. Yeah, people complaining models predicted 160-240k deaths? Trump created cesspool federal government instead 'draining swamp.' family vacationing OBX. anxiety going. husband said would fine tourist area &amp; rules strict here. good reason worry. culture shock. Everything open. people wear masks grocery store. Locals give dirty looks see wearing mask. order food &amp; restaurant employees aren’t wearing masks. wrong people? don’t care? empathy? humanity? government told everyone mask protect us people’s germs, protects people germs. People would use thought protecting themselves. nobody seems give shit pass deadly disease someone else. disgusting selfish people be. live, everybody puts mask know indoors around people. isn’t hard inconvenient get used it. would feel sorry everyone disease doesn’t stop spreading don’t believe it. stubborn &amp; malicious ignorance &amp; don’t care spread Covid me. suppose day reckoning people start dying. Hopefully, people coming enough protect themselves. beaches fine social distance, suggest bringing food week. another gift someone 👍 saw someone Twitter said “if scientists correct, could potentially save life wearing mask. scientists wrong, inconvenienced wear piece cloth face.” 

I don’t get either. It’s really difficult understand. That's accurate comparison. bullet causative factor death soldier. Dying heart attack found also carry COVID-019 mean virus caused death. mean? Wasnt strange kept firm 'stance' something 'insignificant'? Isnt red flag?

And back pedal more... dont know santa isnt real?

To everyone else reading beside dipshit: new research(as suppose happen NOVEL thing/virus) showed even worst masks lessen infection rate significantly... course, he’s wearing one public. have. raise nose make mask beard chin shovel shit face hole asthma heart defect, I’m HVAC service mechanic. Going strangers homes point scares living shit me. wear full face shield respirator chemical cartridges try reduce risk. may look like asshole, I’d rather overreact, react get infected. little kids, I’m trying able watch grow up. mom died cancer 4, I’ve already outlived her, I’m trying make sure kids don’t grow without dad irresponsible. Relax. paid bill yet. Makes sense... lungs working less 100%, heart triest pick slack. Dumbfukistan Maybe I'm biased, Swede never liked approach. don’t know downvoted you’re right explaining it’s important EVERYONE wear masks. least, average, unaware rest world. true. matter fact testing less country things Terrible here. one dying parking lots here. infected major cities like Mumbai, chennai, Delhi states . almost 55% got recovered right . Even though graph rising, happening slowly. Trump, Bolsonaro assume, since pro-mask, restaurant bar since beginning outbreak? 


Because ""masks all"" actually means ""masks time"", impossible eat mask on, so...... 


Do suggest keep entire segments economy closed forever?

What homelessness? lack housing. solve homelessness? giving people housing.

What poverty? lack money resources. solve poverty? giving people enough money longer qualify poor.

These hard problems solve. learned solutions decade ago. issue complexity problem live system requires poverty homelessness. live society requires certain level unemployment.

Do know states entered agreements prisons states GUARANTEE number prisoners even though crime decline decades. result, states create new felonies new ways use prisons get financially penalized people committing less crime.

I bet money it... opinion it’s dangerous feeding news promotes particular agenda. understand sentiment, couple things problematic.

2. inevitably truth comes contrary we’ve told, damage done. Fuel poured fire conspiracy theories mistrust media. Kind like happened CDC recommending face masks March, didn’t know could help prevent spread (because imo question knew March) wanted could preserve supply healthcare workers. every idiot brother quoting CDC March, regardless CDCs current recommendation is. could known? use Ulster flag defined province EU take leaders mandate masks? need hit 10k day? hospitals overrun.

Sure, possible. ain't what's happening. data says undercounting. Everything antibody studies (which show much higher percentages population infected case counts indicate--a good thing ways) analysis excess deaths (which show undercounted numbers Covid deaths least 20k already month ago).

It policy going defend it. me, restaurants bars would remain closed (but forever).

However, policy exception requiring masks allowing exception eating drinking silly. simply matter weighing costs benefits.

The R naught number key metric. ""the average number people contract contagious disease one person disease"".

If R naught greater one, disease spiral control. R naught less one, eventually extinguish itself.

Let Policy 1 ""require masks public 100% time (effectively public eating drinking)""; Policy 2 ""require masks public (except eating drinking); Policy 3 ""do require masks public"".

If Policy 3 creates R naught greater one Policy 2 creates R naught less one Policy 2 reasonable. Persons like prefer Policy 1 simply go restaurants feel comfortable.

I hope you’re taking easy can, friend. hate you.  US pretty much fucked point. want know government spending time doing?

Instead anything help pandemic, spent time effort drafting memos propaganda blitz China, Syria, Russia, god knows else.

Pompeo got done telling China need like America.

Look happening America. letting pandemic run rampant, killing minorities protestors, police saying decide laws enforce. 

Why fuck would anyone want like us?

Why people spending effort shit like help needed country? casino work at, guy usually plays average $1,000-$2,000 hand double 16’s less $1 joke dealer call out. misinterpret means— much population still vulnerable. deaths made everyone serious social distancing soon behavior begins relax worst trouble easily resume. Also absolute numbers function population testing. reason CA positive test numbers look bad... bad. covid related subreddit without US based news? like old worldpolitics (not current one went insane) said mother morning complained neighbors wearing masks even though several people apartment complex Covid.

If putting piece cloth face scares *that* much, fucking sissy. Answer: opposite Oh, I'm aware. going happen. inevitable facts currently 41k active cases among 29 million ppl. really hope ramp testing too. cases mortality serious cases fall. watched mortality fall 2% week look serious cases worldwide. dropping ball. reacted minor problem. stupidest least scientific use R0 ever. seem massive campaign media article. low levels importantly isolated outbreak plant apply. mean scientists need calculate it, also know context. idea media doing, fear mongering countries good situation, ignoring bad one.  True. Chicago also looking good, still allowed indoor dining. sub people got coronavirus experience symptoms would least 10 times active sub. think people really start drilling looking city city instead statewide. Honestly, feel like go Walmart though much, much worse. Thought Phase 4 less month start. 

And alert meters fire-engine red. restrict anyone went rally traveling next 2 weeks, including Trump works weeks. people start notice hospitals overflowing bodies stacking. Ignoring problem solution. live rural MI one wearing masks give side eye wearing one still cautious. book disastrous bad dealings coronavirus separate chapter “The Tulsa Rally” It’s listed low risk there’s evidence date get food, according CDC, medical bodies. 

Multiple doctors explained eating food lot inherent antiviral defenses whereas inhaling aerosolized particles (from coughing/sneezing) go gastrointestinal track lead direct lung infection. Go back hole ignorance please Sadly think take 50,000 deaths spread across US people take seriously. also require number young people long lasting health effects take seriously. Aka keggers? Let’s honest. Going beach ok. Going house parties not. Nobody claims masks 100% effective. still irresponsible needlessly risk people's health, even risk small. matter are, still failing accomplish trying new account.

Don't get sick. pity. Three feet underground? call people covididiots. believe whatever right wing whoo whoo here. definitely cause resurgence. economy really going screwed. Bill Gates interview early said either going stay home orders right open early follow precautions different areas untill vaccine believed would destroy economy Thankfully everyone wearing masks facilities require masks worn hand sanitize everyone. 

But still I’m scared I’m hoping won’t backfire us. Although majority following rules still many people don’t realize serious is. exactly ""people like you"" mean? could possibly know dude thinks masks based single comment? Blanket statements accomplish anything

How controversial could possibly suggest people sick stay home? going litigate every single run-of-the-mill public health advisory now? relevant statement describe day 2020 Yeah letting everyone know DeSantis going anything situation put entire state in. Lemme explain little...

So starting course everyone shut down. state even start closing practically forced government, people starting stay home due obvious safety reasons. everything closed would think bad now, low behold disgusting, selfish, complacent people ever met guess what... ONE STAYING HOME!! 

First DeSantis wants claim virus even Florida yet, week announcement news. Hmmm weird right? better yet let's talk absolutely NOTHING unemployed people suffering worst website ever imagined, purposely made way keep unemployment low. let's talk actively pushing open everything way soon.

I work food, working since lockdown lifted, last time checked forced work situation exposed ignorant assholes can't keep fucking mouth shut, nose way. Genuinely scared life, due birth defect affects heart, breathing can't afford get sick, might die due pre-existing condition.

I think thing really want hit home one thing. Everyone complaining due virus rights ""taken away"" big reason everyone opening people protesting stuck home. Genuinely everyone feels like want ask question.

Why rights leave house, things trump right live? live safe mind you. sick virus, go can't handle inside, make dozen people sick three die. took three people's rights away, taking fucking life.

You may able get time back virus, fucking think someone living years, versus missing weeks important selfish ""rights""

Stop selfish pigs, think people besides yourself. Especially times. Neil DeGrasse Tyson: even end talking cricket baseball? I'm West Michigan heard people called snowflakes wearing mask yeah seen mask-wearing distancing 95%. long shot. Meanwhile Ducey turned Arizona petri dish don’t kill grandma

Although probably heard before, shit went window moment people went protest across globe virtually repercussions.

The protests set precedent. ok go now. Oh looks like goalposts grew legs again. Zeke good boy nail suckers down. Thata boy. fast easy solution. accepting lives going full inconveniences foreseeable future. that's acceptable selfish population. Yes would even think work first place? live Miami, safe meet friends outdoor spaces wearing mask? blood test done couple weeks ago nothing came according primary. sick months mental torture. Never sick long. reopening plan? reopened scientific recommendations. complete 4 weeks lock-down tourism earlier curve already exponentially declining? Reasonable. right say that. think hysterical. angry towards him. fault.

kind Copypasta:

Why American ignoring science facts?

Because trained so. Foreign Intelligence service, traitors useful idiots established last 40 years.

""As mentioned before, exposure true information matter anymore. person demoralised unable assess true information. facts tell nothing, even shower information, authentic proof, documents pictures. ...he refuse believe it... That's tragedy situation demoralisation."" –Yuri Bezmenov so? opposite attitude America. always emphasis individual rights collective good.

Look zipper merge highway rush hour see behavior go dramatically wrong. everyone took turn, didn’t feel need rush ahead, cut drivers, first, everyone would get home quicker faster, mention safer. But, always someone wants first, save themself extra 2 minutes even cascading impacts cut far cumulative two minutes lost. 

In Japan, every resource precious. People understand balance things occur greater good. there, tell nothing like America, though awe wonder beauty it, know cannot occur here. selfish driven give much collective. 

Sometimes great things drive, put men moon push boundaries computing science. strive reinvent market, first WalMart becoming nation’s retailer Amazon changing way interact retail all, greater good, Sam Walton’s Jeff Bezos’ glory. Americans like others. 

I hope never lose individual drive great. wish people could bit considerate everyday life. Truly unexpected send 4500 positive patients nursing homes instead ield hospital spent million build.

When mask worn, wearer protected, rather protecting around (we hope). many studies conducted efficiency masks preventing asymptomatic carriers spreading virus, conflicting findings. Since new virus, hurt try something, anything may help. take whatever necessary try contain virus much possible, nearly impossible maintain social distancing many situations.

There’s real discussion things going truthfully. Things change overnight. nothing optimistic since beginning past 10 hours we’ve given horrible news around world, seeming pattern say authority virus isn’t yet. Travel safe! sleep stomach? Good ive whole life  start BLM wave. going get much much worse honestly shocked people say social distancing permanent. quite think like that, seems... go. want back high schools colleges. virus nearly everyone alive probably exposed point life. we're trying wearing masks practicing physical distancing slow spread virus minimize impact global health care systems. practices also buy us time develop treatment vaccine. never trying limit total number infections, rate people infected. opening soon wearing face masks could cause uptick?? CRAZINESS That's happened Arizona. opened state everyone pet dog came states closed. We're lucky snowbirds (a lot immunocompromised too) able drive home happened.  looking large delta numbers. many homicides? Yeah still.... people gonna think nat disast new disease... area store owners threatened arson Muh rights mask idiots brain surgery. everyone caches cold flu even exposed it. everyone dies form lung cancer even though smoked whole lives. everyone dies liver cancer even though heavy drinkers whole lives. everyone cause car accident drive drunk. happen everyone, people healthy exercise ton drop dead heart attack run. everyone sees grizzly bear close attacked one...

Life random unpredictable. Best get living worry it... Paywall know watch anymore. We're couple hours speeches seconds watched saw two masks saw guy licking fingers handing something person next row Florida lost mind. 

I’m trying help Jacksonville little seem rather ignore it! Jacksonville also keeping arm length distance also wearing masks , sure, quite safe. cancer heart disease here? People keep saying sweden us nothing alike. doesn’t even need make mandate cult leader open wearing people would wearing campaign masks today N 42


O 69 could vaccinate every year, would catastrophic. Maybe anti-vaccination movement would problem everyone else.

Maybe would even good circulating little bit longer. many dangerous viruses like, HIV, Dengue, Ebola even hints Herpes virus connected Alzheimer disease. Covid-19 boost research viruses immune system extremely. 

Thanks CRISPER massive research, could get understanding immune system could start new medical age. Pockets happen. inevitable. may help. John Hopkins. Mask either effective aren’t, it? thought. makes worried they’re propagating idea public it’s mainly spread surfaces. would better spend money air filtration. cases still keep skyrocketing Disney probably postpone opening Proposal make 51st state names North Michigan renaming lower Michigan Mitten Michigan. saddest thing seeing malnutrition second leading cause death prior covid. Entirely preventable. world sucks. can't get covid food?

There's evidence can. Lets play Cancer Lottery: 1 million chance win. Would play it? /r/CoronavirusRegret would interested finding anywhere states position abortion clearly defined way. mean genuinely, I'm trying argumentative.

What find there's lot rhetoric anti-abortionists *accusing* supporting late term abortions, see anything actually indicates does. know worked repeal ignored 1931 law abortion... obviously political posturing. know favor accessible abortions. see anything late term abortions all. I'd grateful - genuinely - source that.

You sparred bit. Actually thread, recognize username previous conversation too. I'm ok - hope too. mind - want transparent possible. 

I care Whitmer, care much Republicans Democrats. Every time think something common sense, someone like reminds understanding ""common sense"" necessarily common (and mean good way - disagreeing healthy, humbling realize world figured out). 

On hand, think criticism Whitmer received largely immature. example, people accuse shutting things inconsistent ways make sense, think often use full brains.

Mask wearing still requirement, one science shows beneficial. also happens something can't getting haircuts. Gyms stress body cause heavy breathing. Restricting things without logic. own, anyone watched press conferences seen conferring experts, often join briefings. (That's trend honestly wish we'd see of). 

I also criticisms her. think made several foolish missteps throughout this, one biggest exaggerating hospital capacity. claimed hospitals full not. politician, dishonesty like that, however well-intentioned may try justify be, undermines credibility. want trusted, trustworthy - lying exaggerating works you.

That may waste time read, so, apologize. like said - since we've sparred bit, wanted clarify hopefully I'm totally unreasonable, even though opponents online debates almost always seem be. trust probably unreasonable, either, even happen disagree things. maybe got moved? yeah. head scratcher. live Grand Rapids, done great job full it. people auto industry flying back forth Wuhan Detroit president claiming hoax. Even cabinet intelligence briefings warned early January. Tri-cities, MI. Time day seems make difference, later fewer masks see. theory that's less educated (and extension higher population people forced work pandemic) get work go shopping. cushier jobs working home go shopping morning less busy see masks. apologize name calling yeah think misinterpreted well would say ‘are serious?!’ ... know damn well real fuck. real, fact. vaccine, anti-vaccers prevent us truly dealing problem? yes sad. knew someone got tested March, results took 16 days then. thought it’d much better.  doubt Casinos, specifically designed take money, give fuck wellbeing. Although dead customer doesn’t bring revenue, yet sucker born every minute there’s that. Spread among young people eventually get frail. matter time. Good weather, sunshine vit D. people still cautious, mean non-morons. tourism going come back summer. hoping cases would keep going would come back. clearly happen people money time going Florida. one meat packing plant though. working housing conditions staff industry, even single case bound passed everyone factory.

The meat packing industry going change way business lay factories, well hiring practices. One article TV news today one factory management staff actually address almost 1/3rd staff.

That alone really good sign lot staff actually registered residents Germany, required, probably also enrolled health care fund, also required, probably paying pensions social funds, also required. Employers also match employee payments that's probably done either.

In short, owners meat packing companies probably eyeballs shit. Lmao shit man friendly fire Something genetics bet. Reminds radio host used like always wanted discuss black crime stats “open honest discussions race” went rails white supremacy territory indicate sarcasm. die car accident life over, still choose get car... wear seatbelt.

God, hate comparison... CAR ACCIDENTS Please try tell risk tolerance be.

I never told anything 'risk tolerance'. simply laid facts you. risk tolerance include others? sure seem like does.

Look, angst ignorance going protect loved ones... masks social distancing, hand, might.

It's time grow up.  believe masks prevent spreading virus? Yes no? discovered anti-vaxxers know also anti-maskers. care you. claim 100% certain masks anything, really harmful wearer boot.  


Telling might kill mom grandma work. response: want safe, wear mask stay home. know supplies lab plastic wears running low what, pictured different standard laboratory tubes. far ideal, one make due pressed. worried idiot understanding lab work thought 'whelp, tubes tubes cheapest and/or make money'. website! true all. Virulence =/= contagiousness. Virulence means deadliness. 

It’s virus’s best interest contagious less deadly, since means symptomatic people less likely bedridden die quickly, likely remain relatively healthy walk around spread virus new people. Right? People still saying heat kills don’t even know respond? It’s pointless guess. pass popular waterpark texas everyday way work, lot people lined go big slides lazy river full people. gives anxiety pretty much every time pass US track today highest number new daily cases. think least couple weeks. People today won’t sick week, may may get tested two weeks out. Then, increasing hospitalizations deaths couple weeks that, maybe decreasing numbers there’s masks lockdowns tomorrow. DeSantis already said he’s shutting state individual cities/counties maybe again. seems hard pull off. would stop someone FL flying NJ driving in? Really sorry hear that. really hard knowing something wrong knowing get better. Best wishes you, mate. touched face. Tsk tsk. Well that's great relevant point hand.

We talking someone symptoms. could correct, devil's advocate game I'm fond well. poor taste coughing profusely public without mask right now. they're willing admit that, imagine hiding. Florida moron governor  government. social contract says government supposed find ways help cannot help themselves.

That live together society, shared protection.

We keep spouting epitome human rights equality, chips down, nation shows true face. give shit.

The countries societies keep pointing fingers inhumane lacking human rights, give shit. Look Asia, everything help people, half resources, yet better job.

Something seriously broken system governance, society, since democratic government direct reflection society. would mean nobody could ever leave home. plenty symptomatic people virus. Can’t keep everything shut forever regardless believe. Opening soon people wearing masks. Whole country doomed point. matter we're go there's gonna spikes one cares enought thinks less really Lmao released studies 2 months ago saying virus mutate rapidly. science shit. *No one* going able sue.

Not person got plane fun, person whose employer took inadequate precautions, parents college student lung disorder forced back school long safe him.

That's inhuman.

What's modern era everyone wants everyone else punished? directly, what's looking way say people deserve die, even cause obvious neglect major corporation?  OK keep stupid ignoring evidence. Us sheeple won, Airlines, shopping centers, theaters states requiring masks. guess entire world wrong troll ass right. LOL. 

I'm glad people know parse scientific information idiots like minority. Like idiot American Airlines got arrested complying sheeple policies. Hahaha thought people claiming masks 100% effective? post comments made think legitimately curious. I’m located Queens, city small many people us seemingly well. bigger states like FL TX CA currently breaking news record cases really can’t imagine it’s gonna look like it’s time news. moment gotta get headline NY, weather it’s surprising feat triumph somehow it’s gonna like rest world worse Here's full timeline along lot non doomer facts getting numbers? 30/200 15%. 41 year olds 15% chance death Covid. stop acting like algebra textbook solve problems change Five gallon bucket pool noodle garbage bag good kitty litter giving anecdotal account, church/school population Broward around 4000, know 1 person mild symptoms recovered quickly. People taking seriously, masks worn hallways stores, otherwise everything seems normal Chick-fil-a killing drive-thru curbside. Doctors seem annoyed new regulations worried virus. We’re certainly planning worst case, general atmosphere/feeling similar hunkered hurricane never arrived. virus state contained. We’re hiding. Exact feeling. like lungs sporadically shrink. I'm much better still breathing issues low grade fever. I'm day 142 insane. Goddamn.  knew something like that, think they'd come admit media. - read graph - literally says graph link provided. ? Huh... even mean? Everyone already playing. Except chances getting cancer far greater 1 million....... Two months later group scientists U.S. signed petition paper airborne transmission removed saying inconclusive. goal paper show effectiveness masks, btw. authors copped could used less sweeping language times, feel important emphasize masks great deterrent inhaling virus, RESPIRATORY ILLNESS.

Meanwhile, smart scientist, Linsey Marr running circles around bullshit actually working help make sense already know. also, twitter, said re: petition, ""Theres evidence route infection."" took mean that, standards, surface transmission proven actually worse - there's even circumstantial evidence transmission via surfaces. circumstantial evidence points prolonged exposure, INDOORS, breathing infected individuals leading mode transmission.

Finding two active viral particles surface means nothing. Finding thousand also means nothing unless prove people moved active viral particles surface, hand, respiratory tract infected. terribly. People mobile that, unless city verging another state, like New Jersey/New York. 

It mean never relax vigilance, though. give look people wear Spain vaccine cure always six months away arguing anyone. informative since saw really recent positive news discovered video talks covid-19 negative patients labelled positive put vent, I'm US problem country, scary makes afraid bad luck one cases get sick family gets sick. We’re constantly lectured social distancing prevents spreading virus. We’re told wearing mask prevents spreading virus. We’re told washing hands prevents spreading virus. What’s point taking steps someone can’t anything? I'm sorry hear that. makes sense mean monitors armpit enough know what's normal what's changed? one friend lump neck year turned benign adipose deposit. another friend exact problem turned cancer. Thanks mentioning importance screening. shutdowns mean believe regular screenings visits.

Let's get pandemic! We've got 3 months already. :) need still lockdown. People leave house anything besides groceries medicine criminals empathy... Florida sick March. Chest pain, short breath, fatigue, lost taste smell. high fever cough though. phone visit NP said probably covid go ER started gasping air. Rest family similar symptoms severe. get test time. kept relapses never really got fully better finally went doctor April. 

She basically told head.

I need new doctor. I've taken calling selfish ignorant. Shaming shuts certain extent Classic Thump. Still warmups. saying severity decreasing hope true.

Before reddit investigators say guy idea he’s talking works front lines covid patients Yeah it’s weird. friend went clinic symptoms tested positive I’m pretty sure got faulty test. Going try go get tested again. state shut two half months considered virus contained.

Good luck pretending Liberal pushing Right Wing agenda. Stop showing beach images 20-somethings. That’s majority outbreaks happen, that’s majority infections. Two pull quotes article:

The 24-year-old, healthy basketball player, also high blood pressure pulse rate, blood thinners might take whole life. 

 Another former COVID-19 patient, Rona Ohayon, 32, suffering fatigue weakness, take mother doctor’s appointments, remembers say told. “I’m focused pain, don’t remember things,” told Channel 12, adding came relief know ongoing effects unique her. 

One things always interested long-term effect recover. Thought interesting article share. I’m grateful live PA.

So many idiots going rants Wolf tyrant dictator…

Idiots. short answer: No, cannot expect tests quick accurate enough useful. must hype. NJ resident here.  Sorry peak 7 weeks ago, can't blame us anymore. Probably going rise summer. Good luck there. proper thing rated N95 big half-face respirator. can't get hands regular N95 mask next month, I'm going wear large half-face respirator school. Education lacking rural areas state. like going rural Kentucky areas. right wing conspiracy theory taken gospel logic science nope listen America always stupid?  Surely America made Panama canal like this. Currently 106 Phoenix suburbs, it’s supposed reach 112 Thurs I’m sure that’ll wipe Meh turds shitty anus. handled national level. State state garbage anyway. we're realistic, 10-20 times undersampled we're realistically looking 300-600k cases day problem ok maximizing deaths. Wolf saved lives. Israel again? Man guys definition hype. Lagging big factor treatment lot better March April. Doctors nurses getting better idea handle tracking patients better well *cases increasing counties protests* Massive unemployment businesses permanently destroyed lol. crazy part supplied mask get event. appears interviews lot think temperature checks safety net, imagine hive mind takes people don’t want wear mask. Good luck dust clears. fun looking mirror couple months lol. think crunch numbers see median American taxpayer spends much taxes healthcare services euro countries provide, basically ends wash. could universal health coverage without really shelling money. money goes somewhere else. grief wacko reds gave opening fast enough. Man stood firm save alot lives Red state right now. People always seem forget New Jersey significantly better almost every state. New Jersey safest towns country, tied fourth highest Human Development among US states .943. New Jersey independent nation, would third highest Human Development world. cannot emphasize much better rest United States. Calling New Jersey trash you’re somewhere New England get ill even die. Human trials like that. contrary. dishonest pretend count covid deaths people died testing positive, ignoring thousands - cases, tens thousands - people died clear covid symptoms never tested. Data excess deaths show beyond doubt pretty much every single country major outbreak severely undercounting covid deaths; go countries like UK, Spain, Italy Netherlands underestimate toll 20-40 % like Peru Indonesia, underestimate 100%, Ecuador, underestimate 300%, probably worst world (and without even considering authoritarian countries, even difficult knowing real numbers).

Chile, along Belgium Ireland perhaps others, one handful countries honest. Sucks non GSW fan. parity year great. Oh gosh, feel like I'm reading something wrote. 

This EXACTLY like going parent's house. Fox News background, right wing talk radio. I've struggling past months feel like responsibility help them, like said, can't compete TV. tried conversation dad masks months ago, every point tried make met another conspiracy theory rebuttal. Later day sent link conspiracy stuff, wrote detailed response linked bunch sources explaining pandemic hoax, masks help. got response. felt defeated. 

I avoided going house pandemic, stopped time pick boxes old stuff, experience increasingly uncomfortable. feel like know understand parents anymore. sucks. reading least reminds we're probably people experiencing things. wish knew deal way healthy me, also extremely damaging relationship them. 2 months lockdown nothing. Didnt even mass testing, lockdown pointless. positive cases keep rising government's incompetence. thanks I'm tn dont see many people wearing masks. kinda disheartening Pay wall :(.can't read real hard make look completely ignorant, you?

Please. Carry on. still would pay regular taxes unless return within next three years. guy credibility? USA... nurse urgent care performed test. Seemed like stuck enough. want anti mask anti science people suffer. terribly, fair get act like selfish shit holes make others die suffer. “They thought were!” people think game going Disneyland. Detroit. lot air traffic Wuhan auto industry. Outside area get many cases Which... science. Thank compliment. bracing hate. nice know message understood received positively.

I try always use everyday life examples illustrate argument, parts world, traffic America (and probably also Toronto) like none other, strong way understand struggle individual bests versus greater community good. I’m personally looking forward far less tourists, cancellation going devastate economy. said, people involved tourist shops glad 100,000 people usually flood Charlevoix staying away. beaches boat launches opened I’d hate shut down. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, two scientific studies, two anecdotal.

While studies show long term damage.

So basing stance absolutely nothing, science --And argument defend is, though science case studies run counter guess, equal ""nothing' support wishful hunch. 

OK skepticaljay, you. great weekend, coat troll hole one layer dried jizz superstar. federal government control states money - won’t send relief money unless follow rules New York increased testing substantially months found fewer positive people day day time. They're around ~1% positive rate now. Good precedent next time. Unbelievable, know degenerates get without evil “nanny state” watching them. Maybe one suits better Stockholmers immune end may Sweden fare much better neighbors second wave come.

“In autumn second wave. Sweden high level immunity number cases probably quite low,” 

Now turns 10% Stockholmers antibodies.

 fatal misjudgment Tegnell. Literally fatal many thousand Swedes. Nobody expects providers illness came true remedy. Even do, perceived psychopathic move.  point spike inevitable. dropped ball 100% beginning. Thanks autofill34, cancer sucks ass. realize growth right arm cancer 2 months... thought body fighting away infection. get, see (on friend) random growth, absolutely looked at. I'm already $60,000 debt. need apologize. He's always way. Every family least one, ours. southern states seeing spikes cases death counts flat. wonder count deaths differently lags (or even delay reporting). feeling unless death counts go up, politicians always make excuses like due testing (which misleading best) even like flu. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Hey, seems pretty interesting, anywhere could read theory? preaching choir man. I'm putting facts I've seen TV news, I've lived Germany long time speak language fine.

Still, went pub today 3rd time months, watch second last round games Bundesliga. two owners wearing mask pub, almost nobody wearing one street.

I know that's anecdotal, people around asking come back. hope make man take covid seriously can’t stand people think it’s something isn’t real Haha we're still top half first inning. ...it'll go away, like miracle. would write ""victim"" sentence all? incompetence paid excellent Supreme Court decisions. bad. That's cool.. cool.. get it? Sure. What’s someone allergies supposed do, stay home? PA much mild spike rest Northeast states Like flies honey! I’m sorry...I idea. profession clinical nature although closely work clinicians / medical professionals sorts &amp; believe every issue resolved / worked given large enough data sets / trend monitoring /possibly solutions &amp; time - (I struggle physical afflictions &amp; see time live &amp; limited aggregate knowledge solutions limiting factor). 

I look further, commonly thought / accepted thought causes this? Serious question, live Michigan, would ever want leave? Like don’t know anyone Michigan like, yeah... would like leave state. Michigan unequivocally best 50 states assure nobody wants leave..especially surrounding pits misery. Hard say happen. saw beginning pandemic US idiot Rudy Gobert, take virus seriously. I'm sorry loss. Valid point. Sure would nice stats common “long haulers” really are.  things excuses, true headline poorly constructed. meant random new vaccine candidate first ~~victim~~ volunteer. Roy seems good guy. sad truth Roy want reopen state. reason felt pressure every state borders NC addition OPENNC protesters running around like mindless fools are.

I get people work make money phase 2 opened knew gonna get bad quick certainly has. There’s “spike” it’s called increased testing, contact tracing exaggerating numbers. Disney World/Universal Studios tourists!


I'm Orlando


I4 bane existence I'm otw work mornings u/Mighty_L_LORT current trajectory talking about? miss shaved ice snowballs... Soft newly fallen snow melts mouth like crunchy bits crushed ice eat mainland.

At least four things like musubi make it... spam supermarkets... proper shaved ice machine? Can't find stuff anywhere. bad news dsy atfter day Covid makes wanna drink....

Now Im thinking might die alcoholism complications Covid19 ever shows up.....

The gunshots, fireworks, police sirens, drag racers....Jesus nerves shot shit.  Ok. also made mistake mistake corrected you. upvoted cause true 100% DeSantis wont allow enforcement emojis perfect comment. think people sharing michigan using big FU people complain constantly governors overreaching powers. I've stores SW Michigan I've actually seen mask usage go recently(anecdotal, people actually wearing liquor stores now). live liberal area though.

I've Target, Homegoods Trader joes week mask compliance seems around 80-90% NY antibody data shows 20% population infected 0.15% population death. Poker rooms among first businesses open Florida. Oxford Downs poker room employee die Wednesday, tried cover up. Health Department notified, sent representative location. close location down, dis ask patrons wear mask. 

There leadership Florida, except lucky enough local government share view governor. People dying still allow others remain exposed, GAMBLE. disgusting something needs happen. I'm La Crosse County. numbers skyrocketing. :( never proven work antiviral people. Lots looking good vitro, nothing show it. going discuss private message want continue. Clearly I’m going get posts blocked Well, quadruple daily case count. I'd say Arizona longer amateur hour... Laughable? You’re one can’t read paper resorts ad hominem.

For anyone else who’s tolerated far, here’s predigested statement thought cloth masks months ago: go search Entrez yourself. lot data either side. paper non-sequitur. 

If you’ve sneezed surgical mask, realize likely going help prevent spread population level. don’t need wait year controlled study call reasonable precautions limited inherent risk pandemic. mean Carlos Danger! lot looking way mean things going back 'normal'. shit close DTW

I live Detroit, downtown area people visit. Around lack masks downright ridiculous. I'd say barely half people wearing about, I've going burbs groceries super early Eastern Market avoid people.

It's coincidence within miles radius house hardest hit area Michigan Covid. dream Yes, states never closed also. 4 weeks almost 2 weeks. Please look list... nitpick one state. Whatever keeps echo chamber. Time bought China.. that’s COMICAL!! China lied everything. China lied covered things would given time countries properly react probably wouldn’t situation.. Chinese ppl lied world lied hell broke loose. Holy shit, didn’t know kind thing could permanent. Totally boggles mind Everything’s fine it’s going disappears

I’m fuckin sarcastic approved Japan since 2014 treatment novel re-emerging influenza virus infections. unique mechanism action: converted active phosphoribosylated form (favipiravir-RTP) cells recognized substrate viral RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting RNA polymerase activity.

Source: So, stats general 10x - 20x deadlier flu.

 report shows equally distributed across age brackets flu.. hence, 10x-20x deadlier Yeah live near Orlando absolutely one outside old people anything. Forget politics, nobody else seems care going make people general let guards result. amazing made it, good news! I'd guess length lockdown varies population. say India's lockdown work premature perhaps take 5 months, 6 months even flatten curve. 
Say India locked down, perhaps we'd seeing 50k cases daily even more. 
Sadly almost imaginable supress pandemic India conditions I’d like see statistic percentage people asymptotic ""if someone killed bystander driving drunk, right so?""

""So kill someone unknowingly transmitting virus someone else wearing mask, right so?""

There may better way phrase questions, liken willingly drunk driving. Sure risk driver they're willing take, people killed drive home - right put risk them. ex-military? Anyone link pushups? puts ex military shame. Reports back long weekend. need convince Gov thing better one victory lap two victory laps.

Let’s pretend round one, new wave deal with. Yeah, well, it’s everyone’s problem now. I’m wearing useless mask, support right wear one. Kind state level equivalent Birx Fauci, early weeks? looked embarrassed sharing stage orangutan. Poor docs people also need respect choosing return normalcy given current statistics / probability contracting COVID Michigan.

There return normalcy till treatment vaccine. reason cases covid-19 Michigan lock down, social distancing wearing masks; people stop things begin spreading like before.

Not wearing mask social distancing point almost like closing umbrella middle rainstorm getting wet.

Edit: thought umbrella metaphor kinda bad like everyone umbrellas middle rainstorm get sick holding umbrella drop grab fire hose start spraying people holding umbrellas.

Edit2: used word comment got removed fixed reposted it. moved goalposts. interesting watch policymakers DeSantis, first glance observe disaster making, maybe information plan intend execute later stage pandemic. I'm US, I'm familiar culture US politics, rule thumb I'd assume people enough awareness.

What seeing bunch people automatically hate everything DeSantis political party. 

Let's clear one thing: whole lockdown/shutdown/quarentine period Florida give hospitals enough time clear wards. spread slowed shutdown hospitals managed get beds freed up. 

DeSantis arguing reopening timed correspond hospitals ""breathing room."" reopening timed coincide last case coronavirus Earth. Also detectable antibodies doesn’t mean lack immunity COVID, cells respond infections body start making antibodies Avon. suppose depends local. saw man exit crowded bar nobody wore mask. man himself, stumbling drunk. don’t know local tourist. proceeded get truck &amp; drive. Many restaurant employees aren’t wearing masks husband goes pick food. sees places people taking things seriously, gives people mask adjusters making make fit better &amp; straps don’t go ears. I'm Ireland, I'm well aware counties country.  ""Nobody really hurting"", except course thousands people died... 

Sweden nowhere close done outbreak, still less 2% exposure mass population, meaning another 73% people country need get infected chance over. means current death toll drop bucket. 

There reason countries border Sweden keeping borders closed it. Considering reported immunity antibodies people Covid-19 might last months, maybe 6 months, vaccine produce longer lasting immunity? That's make vaccine.

Gonna need source that, chief right, everyone knows, governors actually doctors charge caring every single Coronavirus patient...

The governors mayors took advice medical professionals create guidelines rules staying safe stopping spread. place like New York, largest, dense city country succeed thus far whole state lower infection rate around 1% absolutely great feat.

Some people get sick die. need assess preventable every case is. person leaving home whether die. rules place stop getting sick, treatment options available, probability person got different illness like flu pneumonia would critical condition die?

Step one preventing people getting first place, states like Michigan NY done great job long run. places hit hard 3 months ago, course higher death rate. states like Florida, California, Tennessee, Arizona, skyrocketing right now, maybe take statistic later on. Right now, governors mayors charge prevention, personally giving medical attention every patient. bienvenidos los estados unidos /s would still little mutations occurring, would ""unique"" suppose sense city's virus slightly different, point functionally Chinese strain, vs European larger changes. Fyi, Memphis area.  
   County reported 400 new cases COVID-19 Saturday. highest daily count reported since virus identified Shelby County March.   
  now, instead seeing cases concentrated among older adults communal living facilities, said, ""We're seeing much younger people coming hospital, many 20s 30s, many cases chronic conditions co-mobordities. know college town people significantly educated elsewhere Michigan less brainwashed right wing assholes going people listening science. Sadly happens vote best interests. average age confirmed cases dropping necessarily mean younger people getting higher rate relation older people. trend data could mean number different things, instance young people could getting tested COVID first spike. comment age like milk 3 4 weeks. Sheriff Joe running again. put covid tents. Yes, answer every problem always “do nothing”, followed “thoughts prayers” inevitable happens. suck wear P95 respirator safety glasses. non-mask wearing people chuckle reproductive rate 1 county (means spreading) care laugh. lot students *need* campus. know nobody cares, point I’m far worried losing friend suicide covid go suck fart ass Huh know this. checked there's setting covid19 tracing though disabled set aint seen nothing yet.

It’s taking week get results now. That's literally opinion letter newspaper guy like official definitions. fine opinion, change fact claiming EU define NI province, ridiculous made bullshit.

And stuff said completely wrong still completely wrong. really time stop posting. Yeah well, let's call Schwarzenegger Rule.

Some moron made political. right actually hurts. understand. would define extremely bad? I’m looking numbers reported cases doesn’t seem though reopening justice efforts minimize spread. 

I agree points, don’t believe “wait see” things go considering climbing death toll. know casualties journey back normal I’d hope we’d minimize first priority. People state Aus get sick, get tested, positive, go large gatherings family members. think even day two like 2 cases day that, freedom given back lockdown. understand people test positive stay FUCK home 14 days millions live city get back normal. infuriating baffling. Even witness dying still might cheer on. know? Cops enforce law. ""I law!"" motto. would possibility perceived submission people didnt need told right thing first place. People wont wear masks created opposition. Live-streams protestors themselves. say ""nothing see here, move along"", ""come Corona-free Spain vacation"" ""bullshit"" Spanish ? Makes sense, Pleasanton sucks. Summer vacation locales northeast like Cape Cod Hamptons seen spikes. Gotcha thank you! think broken state geographic region US would look like lot European countries shown.  
 
Although many places US seeing surge, relatively good shape lot places hit early on. Yes, inhibits viral replication, maybe that's approved quick.

But anyway, slow progress better progress China : oh no, something moving ! bat! Let's eat start pandemic 

US: let's stick normal diet no!!!! Yes. Conservatives always wrong side science. answer every problem always nothing. question can’t exercise freedoms non risky activities? Even you’re getting bored stir-crazy, think many different fun things going crowded restaurant. involve nature, way better body mind anyway cost next nothing.  think result government officials lying populace beginning masks flipping. say “don’t use N95, make cloth masks” think would higher compliance. Lying strips liar integrity kills trust people hearing lie. 

Lie kids something life death, see much trust that. Air conditioner cooler different things. thought India done well long time. sounds control  Yeah, far seems area venue gets closed immediately employees sent home upon learning positives. People really like pessimistic news .... especially comes China WHO. Rally bad, protest good. Considering family attacked doctors blame hospital death... Somehow doubt sort people sense responsibility guilt. judgement mean fear? possible - think youre wearing cuz virus. think plan actually sound, follow important part plan monitor results phase react accordingly. started plowing phases rationalized data fit narrative (which many people correctly predicted would happen started). also neglected enforce measures plan. Lmfao consider 4 weeks almost 2 months. Doctor also refuse call cancerous cells generalized cancer, even complain.

You wait nothing, argue right, indeed generalized cancer. win? well, never thought I'd need either one. guilt feeling comes with/after doing/commiting something wrong, whether believe punishment god not, nothing God, human feeling. (that's believe, I'm talking behalf philosophy atheism) really shows decentralized control United States. countries lot capacity enact country-wide policies. 

They also better leadership. shut places super-spreading occurs: churches, bars nightclubs, parties.

Require masks indoor public places.

Require people job home job home.

At workplaces people be, protocols making safer, including masks keeping people physically distant much possible. Burn PTO avoid plague pit known office? That's silly take, boomer. China notified December. went lockdown mid-January.

The US see exponential growth mid-March.

The US start planning mid-March. Facts. live escambia county, everyone tired thinks hoax. dont know ever bad though since juat moved friends/family also think fake, assume tourism season aboot get worse. Malls open, restraunts open, bars, etc. People also dont give shit social distances bothers me. find comforting, actually since talk many people person. true math exclude nursing home, prison, group environments leave, add asymptomatic, get estimates well people self quarantine positive cases.

I'm end chance infection day much lower think course normal activity would higher think. one conversation, half people can't conversation nobody else can. 

A petulant child screaming parents avoid listing mean parent trying communicate. difference many states regions US late party, seeing first surge now. really whole seeing sustained surges hotspots like aggregate graph might suggest. 
 
Many European countries hit approximately time, showing aggregate give appearance nice ascending descending peak. thought trolling allowed anymore Jacksonville too...the part Florida gives rest Florida bad name....well, worse name. Hillsborough too. know someone tested last week results wont another week least huge backlog tests Time recall unlawful sheriff. wish onion think it’s time people start freaking states. difference make laugh cry? You’re even really cog machine pandemic, you’re like 1 person sitting sports stadium 60,000 people. reaction bearing happens. illustrates fast counties growing infection rate relative population. honestly dont k ow would count extremely bad. numbers threw would straight Department Ass. clue many cases deaths would neccessary enough people ok lockdown. wont works majority says fuck doesnt listen. 

 say least compared march, probably better idea what's going where. first lockdown, idea would 1k 100k cases. state 5k cases, 1k active bit 300 deaths, mostly one area. lockdown measures, assume would concentrated rather statewide. would, dont 100k+ dead cant. Noooo! face palm! Unless air palm, can't tell angle. takes one positive Democrat “infiltrate” accidentally purpose bad hygiene. don’t understand aren’t thinking going prove party affiliation??? understand argument. I'm saying wrong.

Heres graph cases per day calculated ifr 1% official death stats, shifted 18 days.

I also added ICU cases per day curious well new ICU patients correlate deaths/cases. shifted 10 Look. virus sucks. Bad. wish asshole eat bat.

Nobody wants sickness death.

And wish inkling competent leadership handled pandemic even marginally well.

But don't. Trump.

So are. virus stay way vaccine herd immunity.

A vaccine still year away, ever.

So herd immunity next best case.

Keep spread hospitals handle, NEED spread healthy individuals.

We New Zealand. heavily traveled country earth. Eradicating virus impossible. need learn live it. Ok, Ron. anyone also loss smell taste, senses start coming back?  feel guilty laughing headline...probably guilty family feels.  Labs need in-person. Unfortunatly theres way around yesterday. Yep, clicked random information didn’t really support theory. Clearly guy didn’t read DeSantis looking spring cleaning... /s 1 2 filled 24 bed ICU. severe respiratory distress severe hypoxemia. (Low blood oxygen) post, nothing see it. essentially Spain nothing without tourists then? 

With UK government shady case death toll already high could possibly go wrong Hopefully Jacksonville bad, coming biggest doomer all.

Jacksonville big population, *size* Jacksonville ridiculous. one stacked like north.

Europe duty China - contain virus.

They didn't.

China bought us time.

We use Europe buy us time could done month ago, probably would saved many lives. point got many state people hot zones make stay enforce kind effective quarantine return (i.e. voluntary bullshit know people follow). work outside glasses sit top face mask dont get fogged up. Might help don’t think giggling Oklahoman disagree politically getting sick help cure anxiety depression maybe I’ll skip yoga try that.

I get I’m control spike. However talking choosing mentality. Instead finding humor people getting sick find healthier hope isn’t one doesn’t ruin progress I’ve sacrificing life for. battleship turned, thank god selfish. 100,000+ deaths Americans think : “mUh spoRtSBall mUH conCertS”. Wake up. new normal it’s stay.

Mass gatherings may banned permanently fact. Therefore belief sports go business whole without spectator revenue. Traditional sports shift “e-sports” League Legends CSGO.

Concerts also banned permanently likelihood. music industry toast “music” simply shifted object-oriented programming tutorials.

**Could Acetazolamide used way treat Covid-19?**

Hi, would like someone medical field weigh this. 

One common symptom Covid-19 breathlessness. read articles Covid-19 survivors compared breathlessness felt illness one felt high-altitude treks.

I high altitude trek last year, started 7,000 ft went upto 12,500 ft 3 days. prevent altitude sickness, trek organizers asked us start consuming Acetazolamide (Diamox) day prior trek continue till day trek ended. I'm sure drug respiratory systems good, none us got altitude sickness.

I wondering Acetazolamide could administered patients experiencing breathlessness, get body acclimated low oxygen levels, us trek.

I'm doctor med student, would like know drug works (google searches yield much), cannot work. Well, model US government using predict death toll US 200k around 1 October. Here's decent follow want perspective Atlanta love push gibberish headlines. 😂

Nano Bob sponges? Next week see Nano Patricks too? 🤣 still sounds much good true, see guess...

i've dull sense smell whole life. even know I'm That’s due Wolf cautious careful. Unfortunately won’t see trend continue everywhere go PA see people refusing wear masks one willing enforce anything really. it’s opened back completely think know downward trend change course. wish wouldn’t already see increasing county live we’ve open several weeks. Getting beat layup drills  find plenty low risk people willing punch since high risk. would volunteer punch immunodeficiency disease. What's legal situation type measures? Presuming normal, must sort recent legislation Germany cover it? Afraid disproving simple-minded tag. would require basically sequestering young people, intentionally infecting them, keeping sequestered recovery. Yeah, know, probably nit sub explain R0. think mainstream media using way making wrong people scared scared totally ignoring issue. pub mask story, sure, bad Germany, probably like Europe, manage well, least autumn comes. people Americas not. articles high R0 successful Germany fuel anti mask crowd US, Mexico, Peru Brazil use R0 comparison cause big damage. general public know volatile R0 small numbers. don’t know single super spreader country technically cause absurd R0 30 he, spreads say mass meeting 30 people.

It’s gonna vary state sure, many states won’t shut again. doubt many states go quite far first time around. we’ve seen several states seem take pretty scientific reasonable take throughout I’d expect shutdown least partially numbers call it. Like I’m Illinois, I’m pretty confident governor shut shit back necessary almost none docs work worried longer see much worse flu.

Well doctors work ignorant science COVID-19 scare living hell think weeks cases level again.

Because miracle occur? would think re-opening Texas pandemic control would cause cases ""level off""?

I got bad news you: R0 number going skyrocket. Well 14% risk make huge difference scale. But, course, free pass anything. Horrible 

What's wrong people? know cant change mind, hope keep pushing through. life worth, hard see time like this. Stay safe friend covid incubation period asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission

And Old people particularly susceptible [Post Malone’s Latest Car Collection family stated month ago virus over-exaggerated media.

I guilted coming visit - even though lived one first US Covid hot spots.

It’s going shit show folks. disease affects us bad way. Reasonable creatures would unite (or least minimum coordinated strategy) fight it.

The fact let individual agendas interfere that, letting grandpa may die order buy trivial new pair jeans, goes show selfish average Joe ""modern"", ""educated"" society...

I think creating self centered individuals promoting selfish mindsets. War nothing guy next door mean daily jogging friends.

This pandemic great opportunity solidarity. Instead raise occasion showed ugly face individualism. increasing counties without protests too, including rural counties. Waco 15.65% jump today. protests help biggest issue far people going bars restaurants, usually zero masks. want good tournament, fine, probably manageable risk. tf live spectators? Mask use pretty heavy west harlem. 99% them, 80% actually WEAR given moment. wear, generally, closer people.

Also, lots vendors selling masks street corners. sound excited. make excited? I'm gonna say big hit like NY NJ.

Evidently, lack capacity parse scientific information thus cannot fathom information says. someone who's got least high school level understanding science read lol.

It's new virus, contagious previously found Corona viruses scientists medical professionals changing views evidence comes in, implementing scientific method. Funny, keep pointing Fuci said monts ago yet leave cdc recommending face coverings recent weeks, again, due evidence coverings reduce transmission rates. turn, makes California followers call Newsom Nazi. ridiculous.

Trust me. would prefer live much life possible, also want actually live life have. Sometimes two things odds make compromises put risk. enjoy motorcycles, know dangerous. would safer didn’t drive dinner friends, instead stayed home. would still chose live take drive meet friends. Even though means higher risk shorter life. Covid another one risks lifespan asses decide willing sacrifice reduce risk. place new risk similar ranking risks trade benefits every single day life.

There's data, study evidence points benefits hydroxychloroquine treating preventing COVID-19 infections. However, there's plenty evidence drug brings increased risk sudden death due cardiac side effects.

They asked many things frankly one side job (social support) completely odds (fighting violent crime). large it’s reactionary; don’t stop crimes occurring, support victims happened.

“Our genetic data confirm blood group associated risk acquiring Covid-19 lower non-O blood groups, whereas blood group associated higher risk non-A blood groups.33,34” Bruh like can't wrap head around fact poorer countries lower minimum wage lower cost living compared US, world's richest country. think simple concepts could hard grasp. agree. feel political agenda China? met ""fears"" (actually hopes) hysterical doommongers sub even lot ""models"". percentage Sweden's population actually affected still absolutely tiny. *According current confirmed numbers likely skewed*. 

Of course.... that's call ""crude"" CFR.

The fact is, way Sweden could *crude* CFR nearly double global average reporting smaller percentage actual number cases nations world. say ""most"" mean 213 nations, 16 nations higher *crude* CFR cannot make actual assumptions real CFR majority confirmed cases. 

I'm making assumptions. stating facts. way, know CFR is, right? know differs term *infection fatality rate* (IFR) also applies [infectious outbreaks, represents proportion deaths among infected individuals. closely related CFR, attempts additionally account asymptomatic undiagnosed IFR differs CFR aims estimate fatality rate infection: detected disease (cases) undetected disease (asymptomatic tested group). 

 

The case fatality ratio simple calculation percentage confirmed cases result deaths. talking infection fatality ratio, also tries account undetected cases.

The best estimates true IFR around 0.5 1.0%. Recently Swedish government announced antibody testing suggested 6% Swedish population infected SARS-COV-2. That's 606,000 cases. works IFR 0.83%, within estimated range.

If used IFR calculate number cases based number deaths, Sweden would 16th highest 213 nations. real comparison though, true IFR varies according myriad factors.

Still, matter look it, Sweden worse nations. live WI roughly 10 minutes either direction matter way leave town middle it. weekend WI opened met least 5 people talking wait go bars WI weekend. county (Dickinson) 3 cases prior that, 6 now. point you.

According Dellenger's report, infected potentially infected LSU players isolating roommates on-campus apartments.

One things China discovered outbreak isolate separately. Otherwise, potentially infecting housemates entire apartment complexes.

The US knows actually care enough provide safe isolation solutions.

Thats pretty cool family...im really happy life going well, stay safe bart. all-time Georgia high. last 7 days average also all-time Georgia high.

And past 3 weeks, number currently hospitalized COVID-19 slowly rising. protests largely unplanned unorganized. protests indoors. later protests organized, people wore masks encouraged others so.

This rally planned. indoors. people running deliberately encouraging unsafe behavior political reasons, going way avoid responsibility consequences. Vancouverite I've pleasantly surprised everyone handled it. Amazing happens actually follow medical expert's advice. one reason person governor, literally risked every person's life words, ridiculous. wont listen though... gives appearance something without costing much . one time measure makes people feel better company point asked anything protect employees. 

The actual process something; testing employees free, giving 2 weeks paid sick workers; actually costs long run isn’t flashy. Well it’s global model it. there’s that. agree 100% think certain people quarentined others able go lives. Like old people stay home along people qho pre-existing health conditions. point shutting everything something pretty minor 99% population. Imagine initial response professional, serious, dare say, Obama-esque? Nationwide distancing, testing, require masks public settings, would pretty well licked six weeks less tiny fraction body count. Trump fucked issue country bad dragged tarred feathered. Congratulations, well done !!!! blamed attacked staff afterwards. lack self-awareness, doubt feel guilt. Florida disaster... scrolled dozens posts, I'm seeing it. 

I want clear I'm anti-mask, potentially reduces spread covid diseases say go it, even data still inconclusive. I'm saying call scientist liar supporting position backed actual peer-reviewed science, scientific consensus, wrong.

You keep full capacity indoor businesses people cannot wear masks *closed* cases reach manageable levels, simple. Oh, keep tourists out.

hahahahahahah really funny joke. put /s denote sarcasm next time. anything changes itll worst. 

Thats climate things explains low deaths rate... Guinea pig lives matter. statistically kills almost nobody 50

And that? 

It people today age category become ill enough go hospital (and many get ill) medical supports available 1918. 

If virus attacked society back 1918 people would dead. would testing virus, let alone ventilators, oxygen supplementation, steroids supports. would wet rag forehead. Oh prayers. 

If pandemic patient becomes ill enough need hospitalized - (she - Doctor interviewed actually said all!) would die back 1918. 

That Doctors entire point - seem missed. 

This virus kills. 
It would kill plenty (people - Doctors - Nurses - armies people work like dogs hospitals) fight back. 

They fight like demons keep patients dying. efforts keep CFR is. keeping shit shoe level.

Yes, absolutely.

Why people think way? So, can’t completely eradicate entire disease state, there’s benefit taking measures? course are! less air share, limited spread.

We extremely vulnerable super spreaders, us wear masks stay home, less impact have.

Your actions save someone’s life, actions simply matter convenience. offensive suggest anything less compliance expert advice exceptions!

Have seen 5G masts recently? I'm starting wonder collectively willed existence belive watching alot people voting. Lol, I’m waiting see COVID deniers try spin things back exponential growth. know quite people suddenly going decide Facebook needs deleting. Lol recalled. Over-reach power, political gain. randomized, irrational orders laughable finally federal judge stepped over-rule her. evidence whatsoever extended lockdown order benefit. we’re one first states lockdown one highest number infected/dead months. also forced nursing homes take covid patients. WTF

She also responsible damn breaks Midland do-nothing attitude told numerous times imminent danger. 

Not mention she’s introducing legislation allow near-birth abortions.....sad pathetic. What’s really disturbing Gov DeSantis Harvard law school grad. He’s local yocal, don’t graduate Harvard you’re stupid. means, YES folks, he’s Trump bootlicker that’s putting Republican illusion “economy great” lives US citizens. state filled high risk citizens, guy could technically committing mass murder. Premeditated might add. Based exact post wrong since says 27. Spring break huge protestors filling streets. course not. covertly fish hospitalized cases, preferably friendly ones, “strategically” place throughout rally.

Nefarious? Yes. Unethical? Absolutely. That’s it. cannot possibly state failure pandemic over. longer plays out, better Sweden’s policy look. much kind opinion. believe would get tested afterwards? Many cases mild symptoms dont care virus would get tested I’m sure not. generally smart people, really didn’t expect them. I’m hoping see light it’s late. parent keeps saying it’s grandma really wants party someone’s gotta voice reason Thanks explanation, yes probably novelty begin with. still find creepy that’s me! stronk States sums counties county data insufficient.

Nah, asswipes probably feel sorry all. backlog yet counted days.

Yup, still hate him. can't beat join them. believe outdoor dining , good guess. Oh, totally different now. get world many moronic leaders 21st century. Around 1 percent, maybe 1.5.

But guess thing burns places poor leadership like US Brazil, knows. white- thought funny Good point. Subletting nice right roommate, every time I've tried there's ""you're renting room place"" vibe. savings outweigh lot time. Decisions, decisions! article says this. Manistee Meijer yesterday, I’m surprised good amount people wearing masks. I’d say 75% maybe. Free comes along things.

That’s idiots wearing masks singing churches. No, add 19m/3=6.3m previously unreported cases last 3 days, see curve rising people careers revolving around sports case forgot. always player fan. fans definitely live without sports. can't. Well, he's cold now. Mission accomplished. pretty stunned see graphic putting Trump bad light Fox News. BLM protests? Brazil's hospitals currupt making new cases collect money forms funding dried hospitals.

There's doubt infections rising exponentially brazil. 55,000 cases single day absurd number.

Police raided hospital brazil claiming 5000 infected 200 dead. Turns lie almost one hospital, beds financial incentive increase number infected patients get money time sources money drying up, many hositals exaggerate number covid19 patients. 

55,000 absurd number even brazil. Ok lets get crazy know this? know limited? don't. 

There restrictions travel Ireland testing anyone entering country. 

Please stop talking things know nothing about. Hahahahaha......... Thank you. thought everyone knew that. bad. 250k .07% US population. lot people tragedy could minimized, still unnoticeably tiny sliver country unless happens include someone know. People's reactions surprising.

Since said sub, agree reaction, making observation.  Someone popped blue bubbles Definitely money thing. grandmas set money going grandchildren reach certain age oldest still years that. grandpa died executed cannot changed

No one besides spoken far know of. live across country don’t keep touch extended family though. really hope least one find voice one. discrediting opinion since live far away can’t possibly know going   Same, I’m metro Detroit id say 90% people Kroger go wear masks. It’s comforting stopped following official covid death numbers seeing spike cause mortality attributed covid. Even using cause mortality drawbacks.. lockdown surely prevented traffic workplace related deaths.. 30-40% increase really 50-60%? There's bunch noise data we're seeing.. know covid deadly. Go Canada proper quarantine procedures. Bedpan? think done great job pandemic said I'm glad live republic central government responsible towns cities. said there's handling road repair Michigan (her opponent accused wanting impose 25c gas tax, called silly. actually proposed 45c gas tax) circumstances around Midland dam stuff important consider 2022 comes around. think state's AG probably take flak Midland dam stuff. Michigan - New York secession FINALLY 12.36 percent positive new cases.

six days ago 4.36. Pennsylvania’s legislature trying impeach Gov Wolf reasons. 🤦‍♂️ I've repeatedly stated want Sweden change strategies 1. deaths / newly gained disabilities Sweden stop 2. pose risk neighbors. herd immunity strategey clear failure. agree experts say lockdown while, there's chance that. thankfully discussing moving away current herd immunity strategy towards internatiaonl, European Nordic consensus Test, Trace, Isolate. Yes, leave suppression part unless current government collapses, bt one hopes TTI enough stop harm foolish strategy caused people / economy, also Nordic consensus European unity. Sorry I'm acreage white person told thing inclusive. That's say NPR. Can't say anything without offensive. Tell BS. going 2 million positive tests math, definitely exclude hyuuge number people get sick (but may long term symptoms) people unable get test.

Anyway, USA seems hell bent getting herd immunity level, speed other, ""10% long-term symptoms"" correct (I think higher, FWIW) 20+ million folks end. Weren’t NY, NJ, MI three worst states mid-April so? Whenever friends something cool call “Big Gretch Energy” Doctor!!! killed man

Put fan bed

Pulled plug hes dead  That's Grimm news China SE Asia? Yunnan regions practically SE Asia. literally least likely demographics wear masks themselves. Honestly, kind moron walks unplugs anything ICU hospital room? lost much faith humanity

I've long time, popular opinion. 

Trump's election, continuous support (by people pretended care freedoms, liberty, freedom speech, freedom protest, US constitution on), Coronavirus world's reaction it, made lot people realize truth. people good. people selfish tribalist assholes, little empathy people outside ""tribe"". 

And, even worse, people dumb shit. Like really REALLY stupid. world much worse could be. I'm hoping reach 1mil end year. Spikes entitled, selfish shits, 5... 4... 3...

WTH people? hard thoughtful member society. Right. seems Nlneed 4-6 weeks see meaningful statistical results behavioral changes. Bread circuses saying gonna riot outside, got it. want unlock things slow hospital personnel need plug equipment.
The real issue moron disconnected hospital machine whatever moronic reasons went though head think allow anybody mouth Every time make similar comment, lot people try correct me. ""You mean sides, surely.""

Yes, yes do. morons enjoy fruits lockdown claim measures overreaction. American comment get Nowhere meat cheap meat industry disgusting joke

It million times worse countries. r/restofthefuckingowl Thanks, will! waves happen everywhere once. first wave subsiding NY, cresting FL. Sweden’s PM, fit narrative? young people spreading virus everyone age 40 know taking stuff seriously, though everybody see wearing masks distancing usually boomer gen x'r. truth hurt me? Wait minute, pants, mask, Florida like fifty shades gray? Green good virus disappear completely yes would

As mask I'm Don’t let anxiety rule life, please remain concerned enough stay vigilant health guidelines. think I’ll OK long run, it’s hard, slow road “mild” case. silver lining don’t fearful catching February, still wear mask public 1. It’s required city state, 2. want encourage continue take seriously. LMAO. ""Still early"". ""Wait another week two"".

Can't wait see things next week. would spend next month trying convince everyone let happen. needs protected. drive celebration like people would make feel special, also keep safe. Canada absolutely fine merely 100 cases day less little while

Ontario alone around 200 cases/day right now, Quebec still north 100 cases day well. atheist 🤘 Insufficient contact tracing, apparently.

Never seen COVID Act before, contact tracing labeled ""Beta"" yo'uve tracking site's data awhile may rolled metric one Illinois green in. think virus unintentionally raise average IQ eliminating chaff? That's surely possible

No isn't. true, ish. (I grew there)

Big Pine Key (30mm US1) called Big Pinetucky reason.

However, even Civil War, Keys Union. Mostly didn’t want give port. speaks sides mouth. said needed earlier.


Because want idiots hoarding masks medical professionals needed. short supply already.


Also earlier insisting people stay home. 


And go out, insisted stay 6ft away others, wash hands, sanitize everything.


So unless doctor, nurse, medical professional physical contact potential Covid19 carriers need mask.


Not mention earlier, medical professionals complaining shortage insisting anything less N95 perfect fit, perfect use, would useless. that's people medical training, need medical grade ppe, work sick people.


That would like racecar driver insisting need 5pt harness, roll cage, fire retardant suit, helmet, etc... Sure racetrack high-speed race. 


But dosent mean standard seatbelt Camry help wreck way grocery. yes thankfully, going enforced? i’m worried it’s not. i’m done state. one's going wear face masks dining. one.  $7.3m peanuts compared $50m imaginery masks.

Or $400m decontaminate used masks. sure. left couple items would impact “deadly” virus outside virus changing. know old news, fact spike cases happening across different states rather concentrated somewhere like NYC also hugely beneficial outcomes.  theory midwesterners grew vacationing driving I-75 SW FL. Whereas people northeast drove I-95 ended Palm Beach. Proud Gov. Whitmer quick action taken state. Nice someone believes science making sound decisions based political misinformation. Deaths lag. Give month seeing something different. never good fight natural selection. species seeing results. group belong Facebook keys, visitors flipping fuck Florida people New York State. think good leaders would campaigns masks safety measures. could even taken cues wartime posters tap patriotism 'Murica type rhetoric many mask refusers keen on. ""Stop invisible menace. Wear mask,"" ""To protect economy, protect neighbor"" (two masked people exchanging money takeout boxes), Uncle Sam star spangled mask, etc. Question 46 47 protests. tried posting them, get removed political Shall keep going?

Strawmanning? No, not. DeSantis says age gone down. say previously much dropped?

I looked article linked followed link article supposed back up, can't find anything. see lying governor says gone down. 

Can link actual information? definitely exist. Might like respirator tho. honestly, you’re ok. I’m glad recognize difference Roughly 40% population stupid completely self-absorbed. That's pretty miniscule difference. yesterday 4.71%. probably noise. Britney Spears: “Hit baby one time.” 23 Clemson football players tested positive. 27% team sidelined result testing positive. That’s fucking point. Read comment. Goddamn people comprehend simple words. basically national epicenter period time

Florida, never wanting outdone, come usurp throne. You’re Catholic, too? Um, read full article. say Kushner behind this. say Kushner behind this. think author wisely decided stick known facts guess unknown things.

Regardless, Kushner put charge President's Pandemic Response - one way another behind this. Post Chronic Lyme feels. I'm two years fucking sucks.  Hang there. Look, he's saying keep moving forward. Great Leap Forward, will. work well society. CA numbers spiked protests especially LA county protests, rioting looting happened.

that conjecture you. article mention protest once. GTFO.  Rookie numbers actually hopeful May, anymore Used 10 dollars (I bought like week came random impulse) unfortunate position wear mask hours day definitely sucks.

For vast majority though needed occasionally minutes time. shouldn’t big deal all. Though required, that’s fucked up! We’ll find anyway I’m sure sick employee text friends work fill em in. 

These guys opportunity right thing squandering it. something doesn’t mean ought to. can't really apply normal metrics current economy artificially depressed.

A ""recession"" general term economic contraction lasts months, nature, lockdown causes default.

We really able measure impact workforce returns full. Technically, correct, we've never seen impact event like this, fact end source downturn arbitrary point future leaves us question: economy then?

Otherwise, we're sort defacto recession we've simply never seen (well, since 1918, economics developed back then, metrics helpful). Shit What's Africa? bot definitely handlebar mustache.  #3 world number infections hardly counts better others Sorry hear that, Uncle passed away well. There's reaching people. brainwashed.  Governor [Peter thing. go 10,000 active cases 10,000 active cases next day virus go away. 0.0% growth magic number virus congratulates disappears. thought nursing home assisted living facility. didn’t know there’s difference. hill would idea that: ""lower death totals mean virus bad""

...over 120k people already dead DESPITE taking extreme protective measures country taken in... probably ever... people say ""yeah well said would much worse!""

...its worse measures. painfully obvious? r/floridaman Yup. small state called Manipur around 550 cases rn. people positive cases people returning states/countries. community spread least. read headline sure Florida. really ate say it, simply natural selection work. Choosing seclude rest world order build immunity outside diseases makes much easier people get wiped out. Individually yes think US going lock again. Bro... serious? take deep breath. read title. read wrote. admit wrong. circle, Michigan like 70% approval rating her. country quarantined.

Norman isn’t immune cults unfortunately. Probably won’t help tell local hospital wildly unprepared. They’ve capacity since October last year. Honestly, think older people careful now, younger care. skewing stats move forward. CA numbers spiked protests especially LA county protests, rioting looting happened. fair, entire point protests fact US law enforcement public health threat? sub never accept anything lockdown 2 years plus. 

Like world could sustain it. Managing pandemics like human history? question. Countries gotten hit followed exact pattern, lockdown not. Get hit, spike up, get around 10% infected, reopen, second spike.  theory people believe media over-reacting virus way undermine Trump, action (e.g. wearing masks, social distancing, contact tracing) address pandemic extension effort. So, them, political campaign.

They far gone common sense. I'm genious amazing thinker clear fookin day want body go round CV. I'm 50 death fear all. I'm ready whatever takes whenever. However, thought spending rest life damaged lungs, kidneys, heart, known unknown potential complication recovered people.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think didn't? link good deep dive cases SC, trying track numbers TODAY posting 1 day old article bueno.

and lets real-- many people actually click article.... Yeah, Plague Inc. get fat update pandemic want $1.39 back. get tons free data thing. stop letting 1000’s people flood streets protest...the rest us stop living lives. It’s biggest dose hypocrisy country seen awhile. Covid last months mess one cares anymore. It’s BLM keeping trump office. Cool, hospitalizations going roof? Draconian measures populace told government-backed scientists. (In China listen scientists otherwise government puts re-education camps). 

Of course easier time quarantine. 


But also lied virus. rate burned bodies suggested probably 2-3 times many covid deaths reported. start also much earlier claimed. Measures place prevent spread month late. 

It irritates US simpletons screwed badly. also considerably disconcerting Chinese government let virus spread December January countries. Nice job stubborn jerks AZ. could worn masks, could’ve crowded restaurants shops bars, could made aspects economy open sooner. Logic insulting people. seems right. young person know approximately 0 people continued social distance people know increases deaths follow increases cases. succinctly, use fucking brain here. Also Australian, side country (Queensland). state copping lot heat conservative Prime Minister keeping state border closed.... today. One southern states suddenly 25 new cases. Keeping border closed seem like bad idea all.

I work government department. department working home since March. scaled remote worker capability 2,500 people, 25,000 - space weeks!

It really sad see happening US, worry American friends. guess silver lining pandemic shone light sad joke US political system is, reasons:

- sitting president controlling senate essentially whatever want, arrested kicked power
- president completely corrupt obvious fashion
- electoral boundaries insanely gerrymandered. Australia independent electoral commissions decide boundaries
- vote mail, vote early, elections weekends make easier vote, voting compulsory (you get small fine vote). baffles drama screeching US postal voting.
- electronic voting machines without proper paper record, companies making machines political ties. fuck. 
- healthcare reform. Old people voting single payer? fuck. received letter government telling hit medicare safety net, means health costs almost entirely subsidised.
- companies essentially bribing politicians... openly (lobbying). What. the. fuck.

I really understand country many smart people, yet many amazingly stupid people co-existing.... corruption simply... allowed happen way does.

Anyway, good luck really hope guys turn around. Stay safe! learned Bill Gates Dems hate USA apparently Brazil 5G killer robot future. Learning best! read said children cancer? said call whatever names pleases(altho mods wont it), children cancer thing inhuman Come dude. Spreading poor information like we're mess. Nobody actually thought exterminated, comeback expected. 0 cases week, number new positives increase. Europe needs keep control, hope achieve that. I. Stop terrified. Wash hands like normal you’ll fine. asymptomatic people getting tested. getting hot. Sun's vitamin may help according studies (if people actually go outside like lol). sub wack I'll probably get downvoted covid's death rate high seemed months ago. Still sucks, still vaccine we're far woods, death rate seeming similar flu. miss people. online course contact 

more information might interested  Haha like rest

My family trying pick up/bring back family member lyon since february... issue border crossing italy france? mandatory 14 qtene?

Ty I'm surprised took long. grew (calcutta), NYC feels like suburbs comes crowds people packed together.  Valve replacement? Cozy rich uncle can. guess seeds toxic craziness always there

There's good book : least even need stockpile bodybags, feed bodies alligators I’m sorry expect time-travel evening get *those* numbers? It’s 8am Saturday, posts entire site numbers published Friday evening. 

It’s like posted score last night’s basketball game like “why telling us happened yesterday”? I'm glad consequences, I'm sure thought 5 hours community service people wear mask. understand restaurants six feet mandated social distancing right? masks intended situations cannot distance extent? people risk restaurant unfortunately employees need go unmasked table take orders/deliver food. fucking sucks reason I’m going restaurants.  Young people... Obese young people... Obese young people non diagnosed diabetes shitty health system...Yeah problem infect young fit healthy people, sadly young, fit healthy always synonymous. knows, might actually created that. Florida Govenor = definition incompetence. Wisconsin Hawaii requiring 14 day quarantine, arresting people violate it. helps island... Mass great job too, think cohesive plan way. dude, see people flaunting ""oh yeah 80% survival rate"" would still rather catch ..y..you think it’s called Generation Sociopaths.

Unless looked different book. one stupid event take place. unbelievable teams fans Spain Italy still flying Europe time. Take seat, you’re argumentative argue

The lack self awareness mind boggling. Feature bug... here's works:

First, get case;

Then, get hospitalizations;

Finally, get deaths. 

There;s certain order things. real number coming in? Nobody believes anything coming Spanish government. lying hiding deaths months Thank Yea, agree across board. added second paragraph post read reply. Similar thoughts sure. Anxious, stressed sleeping schedule royally messed up. brain shut need go bed wake lot throughout night. I'm tired.. You’re citing faulty statistic many people seem grossly misunderstand.

Your chance dying car accident 1% course entire life. that’s approximately .01% year. 

Your chances dying covid around 1-1.5% moment catch it, likely 2020.

So chances dying covid year 100-150 times greater driving car, reality.

But please tell us irrational trying prevent people’s deaths? mainly 80+ year old nursing home patients last breath die WWI?  I've multiple people mention increased cases increased testing I've pointed we're 25% less month ago they're like, know talking about. Governor said increased testing. Jesus, people. hope medical professionals going end great set possible effective treatments bad case, even fewer people need extensive medical support / ICU beds etc.

But yeah, traveling outside Oz day... ever comes Exactly, anything 1 leads exponential growth, higher factor, faster growth.

Angela Merkel explains short video entire generation people run country never major, uncontrolled inconvenience lives. They’re still denial world actually capable getting worse. It’s absolutely insane many jokes hear COVID work. live area virtually unaffected sickness, people see “overblown.”

And guess what, it’s crazy political goddamn reason. hope wrong well. already, according official government statistics (which likely undercounts) ***WAY MANY PEOPLE ALREADY DIED.***

I believe US country messed worst. change belief US response criminally negligent. incredibly rich nation. believe smart. expect outcomes much better nations. telling many nations President Trump would denigrate ""shit-hole"" nations better us COVID-19.

Every single decision President Trump made made things worse. example, Trump called President Obama resign ebola doctor returned US ([for Trump Called Obama Resign Ebola Doctor Returned important? doubt People Republic China wanted US medical professionals ""poking nose China's business."" reasonable infer President Trump would use executive power disallow US citizen medical professionals contract COVID-19 Wuhan return US. Therefore, would sane medical professional volunteer go Wuhan help out. unwanted would punished. believe US medical professionals gone Wuhan early strong numbers, disease could contained Wuhan. confusing read article first time visited parents started wore mask stood outside talking mom. stepdad eventually walked actually asked “why wearing mask?” oblivious stupid lot Americans I’m exhausted. couldn’t even nice said “why think?” shook head like disappointed. Wtf? comment could made point time March till hung It'll likely infect 1,000 people. lot one area, course, still much compared overall daily infections entire US. so? Imagine deaths couldve avoided y'all stayed fuck home. Idiots keep thinking “flatten curve” one time event we’ve moved - mission accomplished. fail realize outbreak starts single case spreading, flare back time there’s cure/vaccine. whole world get rid countries like Brazil United States America fall demise, isolated rest. worry economy try go back normality soon posible, unlucky them, that's going achieve complete opposite. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Now it's, ""it's okay, young people"". Pls use 1 sentence THANK YOU. Cooper say wants one wearing them. saw poll full 49% respondents said would wear mask even mandated. Saying you’re “strong” wearing one convince idiots. Seriously. game told world reacts quickly ordered manner pandemic.

Nope Uh hell  problem Yakima really bad apple packing plants. distancing, lots positive cases, foremen telling workers show work they'll fired. inhumane. That's boss says. also says month... Reminds ridiculous meme saw ages ago basically said ‘we already universal healthcare, it’s called owning gun’. ???????? Agree 100%. know many people don’t care feel things worth risk. However new study showing asymptomatic cases little future immunity troubling. think line thinking dangerous. fatalities going now....but get back situation hospitals totally jammed pack, quality care going go down.

it stands reason young people better chance fighting hospital setting, care goes might certainty. 20 years go then... whole strategy based assumptions still much unknown virus worked. Many Swedes ages needlessly exposed potentially life long health complications, term Covid Syndrome around long time last death. care? He'll office young face lifelong medical issues due virus. yea thats called lying. worst.. worst anti mask, hoax/flu ppl..

But swedish beigade annoy dont understand hill chose.. even payed can’t compare Canada USA Brazil though. social distancing masks still recommended Canada, we’ve avoided major spikes didn’t open flattening curve. don’t think we’re going fast, unlike USA Brazil avoided science together. seem line countries well far. know one mentions? 

When talk high numbers *confirmed* cases nursing homes among elderly, don’t mention group (as whole) way likely medical treatment younger groups. 

I’m 40, grandma probably goes doctor one year past 15 years. 

Not mention nursing home patients essentially full time residents medical facility. 




Those numbers keep hearing, like number deaths attributed heart attacks tripled COVID, probably younger people didn’t seek treatment we’ve told repeatedly it’s dangerous younger. air cooler different air conditioner. think blown hype. Simple. drink need wear mask. might thinking US-specific definition “liberal” mean politically left. world political science “liberal democracy” refers system government ideological Cases deaths down. can't fix stupid, Arizona think shoot it.  Conservative fucking stupid Make sure partake famous Bushwhacker 151 floater! It’s absolutely yummy! Second question, checked every one standard downloaded apps sure whether already given someone else location permission? I'm little confused wording. mean evolved strain China exactly strain China. left house 3 months would refuse contact tracing.

Not think helps, think I'm giving administration list I've talked to, where, reasons.... going go? many live webcams streets? normal there? already discussed several times, including recently Reposts removed. I've read median age infection strongly shifting downward. Florida, example, median age infection dropped 64 37. Since lot younger people getting infected, death rate much lower. Exactly, people filed unemployment still received it, biggest indicator. Florida lost alot money springbreak time frame course lose alot summer. trend continues winter id expect emergency legislation start collecting state payroll taxes. That's if, when, virus gets there, people get tested. Overseas schools outbreaks looks like virus first get in, actively spread time (in incubation period). Day day movement unknown exposure usually worse even pre symptomatic people contagious days knowing, asymptomatic people spread also shorter period time looks like data. Good luck schools cold flu season, that's day day includes outside contact day day. There’s people country attending shit show. Natural selection, guess. Stands reason actually sick hospital. real sure going about, pretty easy see cases accelerating around country. Pretty equal! Florida side prettier beaches - especially since BP oil spill - irreparably destroyed beaches greed! far people, that’s toss - suggest make trip Mullet toss decide yourself! Yes, that’s thing! [Mullet Toss Flora Bama](http://www.florabama.com/mullet-toss) check it’s out! every 4 years, ""BLM"" ... gets voters out.. Yeah mullet toss event Y'all dry heat though. 90F Georgia today.... 75% humidity. Uhhhhhhgggggggh.

I'll still wear mask grocery store though. take slow don’t quite know you’re trying say here. blaming sanitation workers kids getting sick? expect careful respecting fellow man well themselves, many not.

This isnt 2019. days yet are, virus treated nuisance actual threat is, balls think go back way things were. Sorry....Aint gonna happen - new virus, new world rules table.

The virus aint going anywhere, certainly are, looks things.... Universal moved walk around characters spaces guests can't go, position talk long-distance selfie them. close contact. bad idea. LOL. Wtf, actually double checking 3 morning flat wrong here. 

CDC death data; made generous guesses bit due age ranges. 92 deaths age 25-34; 230 deaths age 35-44; 651 deaths age 45-54; 1,568 deaths age 55-64; next category age 65-74 2,541 deaths took 500 even though it’s probably waaaaaaay get 3000. reality NJ likely significantly beyond .04% death rate. NY harder hit us probably story truck is colloquial term heavy goods vehicle, originally American term. a truck is a trailer (and cab) well lorry. A trailer requires cab tractor unit move.

Not busting balls. bad question feel bad.  talking penis ?! That’s way it, mask times indoors, mask outdoors unless close conversing people. rose cases exactly tied rise testing. Yeah, usually compare authoritarian governments lying population China, China seems handled pandemic competently (Although hard tell manipulated information coming China is).

So we're looking incompetent authoritarian leaders bungled response pandemic openly lying population. Brazil comparison make feel less bad? Fine let's use then, US handling like Brazil. Always Good Friday Agreement ensures denizens Northern Ireland live solely Irish citizens. didn’t lol ... joke I’m sure wore masks incorrectly, touching constantly, taking wipe sweat, screaming yelling sealed masks. Social distancing absolutely happening, liar. first masks made pillowcases hard breathe through, also fit husband's face well.

I ordered batch company makes clothing USA, ones made double layer cotton jersey. soft stretchy, bigger, good bit breathable. 

It turns cotton particular inhospitible virus, jersey great filtering cotton weave, still lot better mask all. good grocery store visits. Young healthy people testing positive, may result badly need ventilators die, increase risk otherwise healthy ""super-spreaders"" infecting people may lucky.  childish name call someone legit question. are, piping point finger someone question, putting together thoughtful response? Really? question what’s going lockdown 2? I’m NY based stores reopening. conversations fairly positive, it’s almost like everyone choosing ignore spiking case numbers around world. 

As business owner, student, citizen NY, I’m confused mixed stories I’m hearing. Maybe it’s people never faced problem didn’t comfortable solution before. 5 months lockdown see society opening mingling medical advisement. 

Everyday see horror stories virus becoming threat ever. question realistically what’s next lockdown situation looking like? going close businesses almost immediately reopening NY? restrictions summer socially? fall semester? think depends.

we really know much seasonality first summer it. temps get hot cold think folks want gather outdoors. putting people indoors much likely infect someone.

now possible temps decline virus could live surfaces longer...door knobs, hand railings like. could concerning. right decent idea protect ourselves. places like Brazil getting hit hard? oh, wait..... maybe 6 months

SARS1 antibodies last 2 years, 11. 

Antibodies found blood. They're also stored T-cells even another thing, can't remember name of. 

Just chill. Medical professionals quite sure we'll get vaccine. might yearly thing, like flu shot tho Well I'm comfortable booking keys trip. scuba dive would love get there. Sounds like plan 40th birthday.

""Testing Efficacy Homemade Masks: Would Protect Influenza Pandemic? "" Davies good start want. THINK MUH RAIghts!!1!!1!1!1!1 Ha. Bro...

4 x 7.5 million = 300,000

.4 x 7.5 million = 30,0000 (the death rate described article)

.004 x 7.5 million = 3,000 (your calculation) know, Eagles fan trolling Ezekiel Elliot..dont mind Yea, like....the fuck doctors know? spent decade school studying type shit. ....what fuck reading. It’s hard believe anything hear anymore. Fake news people. Last week Sunday Sunday watched work case count go one million. imagine it’s continue increasing faster faster. :/ know someone works voluntary vacation July due virus apparent lack patients. lab tech employees still work confused testing positive negative told sick are. showed article they're saying article makes sense real. wish making up. Well aren’t making aerosols unless air compressor there... also chemicals portajohn kill bacteria title may misleading point valid. $7.3 million unusable recycled trash. would screaming cheering case OK jackass, go. keeping inflation cutting budgets much you’d like believe wise districts slash budgets. top everything else worry about, worry whether something I’d normally relieve worries gonna kill parents.

Hopefully child okay, too, tested yet. discuss utterly failed prove claim whereas provided examples several European countries good TTI infrastructure. Umm, what? Regular preventative care guided PCP best thing anyone improve prolong life medical standpoint. can't even believe still discussing masks. help. pandemic. Wear masks. Please. love holy...wear masks. POLITICAL issue. matter question opinion. Virus, airborne. stupid people really??? smart enough jobs drive cars, microwave hot pocket, understand simple life saving concept. guess quite opposite. Florida hit 4,000 new cases yesterday.

They're putting NY/NJ numbers now. Jacksonville and/or Miami going next New York City. let's say right. Let's say masks slow it. what? still going kill whoever going kill.


Masks stop spread.

Stopping spread keeps people getting it.

Once spread stopped weeks go away.

Once whoever recovers, does, quits spreading new people, end.


Even correct, everyone get it, (Not everyone gets colds, flu every year), slowing spread keeps hospitals packed, medical professionals working non stop. means sick people get treatment kill people age group.


So age group that's young, inexperienced, takes stupid risks, think know better?


Less 40,000 people die U.S. car accidents year.

So far U.S. recorded 121,000 Covid-19 deaths less 6 months. 


Do wear seatbelt drive? I’ve tried fabric disposable. Disposable definitely better much. know getting slammed wanted point I've meaning read book seeing conversation really helpful understanding points weaknesses. far fetched all. Perhaps, little optimistic thinking control thing. Yes please do!!!!!! Except mask denier de-selected, 63 year old essential worker undiagnosed condition havent seen doctor 6 years insurance terrible. That's first time hear book. Brazil study lot colonization americas spanish portuguese killed thousands indigenous people using diseases brought Europe, like smallpox, syphilis, tuberculosis normal flu (it time since left school though might gotten diseases wrong).

One first things first health minister pandemic said worried indigenous always trouble dealing diseases come places.

They already history mistreated government, killed thousands even recent history (as 1900) losing territory every year. think coronavirus making even difficult hurts really bad, especially one main reasons virus reached tribes first place people illegally invading We've cancelled trips year, west coast, etc. going push it. Carol Dover, president chief executive Florida restaurant lodging association, said remained “guarded” immediate future state’s $67bn tourism industry, even though numbers since reopening “are still going right direction”.

What? can’t. head exploded. wish lying. sucks man. wear mask time go public building, limited days suppose. forget mandatory Orlando's Orange County, surprised since almost everything open Yeah I’m sure that’s part plans. person charged criminal conduct, especially considering police officers infected.. selfish clear strategy failed. There's really way point Sweden's neighbors catch terms death toll. Esp. better treatment protocols significantly reduce mortality *already*.

Thankfully, Sweden changing strategy away badly failed experiment herd immunity towards one demonstrated work: Test, Trace, Isolate. Yeah..heading disaster, didnt western media report April india would 500 Million cases hard India's slums (which India prevented spreading), suddenly became silent.

Truth told , western media's bitterness quite apparent india's cases didnt surge. come third world country many cases deaths first world right? 
Their bitterness like , quite evident reported.

They grudgingly reported wrote articles ""Indian population"" dying? one stupid arguments age factor swallowed up. logic come Brazil deaths skyrocketing despite similar average age India? India far better western world, India's cases rising people recovering. last thing India needs lecture self proclaimed western savior nincompoops refuses wear mask ""RIGHTS"". Nice We've already discussed this. widescale TTI done across Europe. Europe beginning face C19 manner Sweden, Sweden failed, suppose happen everywhere else? Corona doesn’t pass river. People ha e physically contact them, hence someone exposed them. Odds loggers goldminers missionaries. ""I'm horny"" RA Lets take flordia put somewhere else Fauci calls ignoring science call calculated risk. can't stand people treat science like religion. method ascertaining truths reality.  


Science tell slice extra cheese pan pizza high saturated fat increase chance heart disease health issues cannot tell whether experience eating slice worth risk.  


If eat proper diet time without ever taking cheat meal, exercise recommended amount every week, brush floss teeth least twice day, abstain smoking drinking alcohol, etc, also ""ignoring science"" view reality.  


Furthermore, Fauci, CDC told us masks ineffective coronavirus begin with. mistake either. Fauci admits lied us shortage masks already. guy admits sold us one noble lie trust says? What’s really disturbing Gov DeSantis Harvard law school grad, don’t graduate Harvard you’re stupid. state filled high risk citizens, ignoring science could mean lot unnecessary deaths. Hmmmm, wonder about? Yo RA couple returning India, quarantine center. community spread. July Florida gonna get ugly Missed ""/s"" Yep, couple square inches cotton trick. Maybe make feel bit better - father pneumonia years ago took almost two years got back full form afterwards. year two often trouble catching breath. gradually went away. Yeah it’s like anywhere else. I’ve around midland, bay city, Saginaw nearly many people wearing mask. still wear mask support governor. It’s like 2 mutually exclusive somehow.  Lagging factor? 


Look hospitalization rates vs infection rates. moving opposite directions since march. I'm cool playing one positive, positive hit think plan make Bubble small humanly possible, rest everyone every day days case It’s almost like Michigan NY well first epicenters. Ohio seeing thing Columbus Cleveland hit really hard first great Ohio spike Cincinnati hit didn’t get hit hard lockdowns. back forth Orlando Daytona. 

You south Florida. really same. European leagues restarted without much issue, Germany's great. 

The problem US, really control many places. NBA NHL could restart plausibly soon imo need move hub cities Canada instead friggin Florida Vegas. wont argue that... always admit douchery, condemn apologize needed..

The reasons douchebaggery transcend need polite.. 2020.. watching slider go 3 decades ignorant comes healing trust medical system profit driven. Hope serves well. Yeah NJ done great job shouldn’t discounted always is. People hate it, make fun it, forget it, etc. We’re used living life well everyone thinks it’s terrible 😛 You’re right wrong said it, certainly endorsing. wrong that. merely pointing almost guaranteed hypocrisy senate playing politics relief money. I’d bet bottom dollar rushing rescue r _ states leaving NY, WA, CA, etc. high dry. extreme right played lesser two evils game world,because normal people tend think way corrupt politicians/criminals understand part human nature .It leaves vast majority term UK Hobson's choice = choice Heres avoid crowded rest stop bathrooms.

5 gallon bucket, plastic wrap inside #2, done fold put ziplock bag trunk. Throw arrive safely trash. 

For #1 plastic wrap bucket, dump grass.  multiple studies confirming virus really spread children. COVID-19 *not* flu, spread way, lessons flu pandemics *not* applicable wholesale. Pollsters companies make tens millions dollars year, want preserve income. wiff bad polling end company, go great lengths make sure describing happen, cause ones saying, funding business. Asian countries contained continue wear masks. Regardless hate America it’s incredibly short sighted write virus cases. look New Zealand, Germany, Australia, Beijing, Rome. takes one case cause community spread. people interviewed CNN waiting inline mask less talking ""have health"" hats go event. people saying ""they know might get Covid right"". assholes maybe get sick absolutely expect government safe lives. care. problem burden healthcare system sweet Grandma. mask less man saying"" fine use little hand sanitizer touch elbows wear mask""....while motioning non existent mask??? FLORIDA 4000 NEW CASES SINGLE DAY. FUUUUUCK. Trump PLEASE GET VIRUS. Yes, wishing/celebrating death automatic 14 day ban. typical internet troll. say knowledgeable cannot provide single fact back stupidity. go ahead start abusing. still probably get tested. Tracers find church many people got there, different. unaware, Maricopa County large, 4.4 million people. someone lives detro metro area, Boyne area, amount masks I've seen north compared downstate paltry. saw 2 people wearing masks entire weekend visiting, including grocery stores signs posted. Nobody cares. Since know anyone virus, lot people never bothered. 

Actual towns like Petoskey Traverse much better, especially stores, maybe skew liberal surrounding areas? influx tourists though, back summer usual Petoskey. Packed sidewalks mask sight. know one big downtown business opening yet virus/people's dgaf attitude towards it. Antibody studies considered useless actual doctors right now. father, virtual lock COVID, called wanted one make sure. Doctor Cleveland clinic flat called useless lol, even person doctor said would textbook mild COVID case I'm shook not. also fact UK handled situation badly. ministers responsible this. Yep. Jordan Spieth (who sits player advisory board) said entire social distancing &amp; contact tracing plan player tested positive. contact tracing actually happening US? Enough effective? 20-0 even half time. 

Why desperate blow whistle full time? IL well green based metrics track. Go IDPH (Illinois Department Public Health) website website, section says “restore metrics.” shows regions low positivity rate plenty hospital beds. That’s data governor using decide go next phase. 

From I’ve seen, mood people starting go more, lot using face masks (since it’s mandatory). Since protests throughout state didn’t cause surge, think IL really well.  can’t handle inconvenienced couple weeks order respect health well-being bullet dodged tbh.

I know it’s really simple real relationships still. Almost every local state official ( red blue ) failed us federal government absolute worst job everyone .

State governments base expertise deal world wide nation wide pandemics. That's federal government. Even is, states mixed responses state officials clearly done much better others. FFS, look Wisconsin governor trying issue shut down, foiled legislature state supreme court. Even final numbers hard grasp go fraction percent 20% thing either runs course get vaccine. Especially considering length time took get fraction percent considering ready first months. lol Holy hell Chinese bots full force thread. bunch people next door drive infect everyon

Or fly.

This I've trying ask about. Driving, depending people's desired distance dedication could bad enough, yes. flying? dont see connecting airport isnt automatically assumed hotspot. I'm NYC, I'm also worried people might look map say, ""Oh! safe NYC, let's go there!""

I'd happy someone explain isnt big deal. get nothing shrugs bring up. get easy answers this, amazing little acknowledgement. policy really going be, ""...eh, whaddya gonna do?"" Florida like large retirement home areas well? They're fucking doomed rate. Everyone equally weak coronavirus. highly unlikely affect remote tribes resistance affects city dwellers also resistance. 

The problem tribes sort upheaval forces integrate break apart, potentially ending culture. seen uncontrolled outbreak looks like, NYC: random sample NYC dwellers tested: randomly sampled people late April (who strolling outside self-quarantined) antibodies. perhaps 1.7 million NYCers became infected (although may lower number sampling people went outside include fled NYC, go outside). 

There 24,000 excess deaths NYC period March 11 May time virus spreading unchecked, schools closed starting March 16, subways crowded ever week ending March 22. Virtually testing available time. Everything City guesswork indication location specific hotspots.  

It point serious rate death population Lmao nice exaggeration Hopefully. Still though, 1-1.5% 7billion could potentially (POTENTIALLY know probably infect 50% population) POTENTIALLY kill:

70,000,000 - 105,000,000 deaths

And survive:

Countless millions persons lifelong lung conditions. (We really know long term effects disease around 6 months.) saw videos protestors thousands packed together extending blocks 2 weeks ago. said, yup... infections going go sky high.  Screaming yelling. tear gases start coming out.... reminded science videos people coughing far travels.  Yup numbers going break records. however areas actually rules outdoors rarely enforce them, it’s mostly closed public spaces, supermarkets, public transit etc. Florida fine till trump loving asshat governor decided rapidly open everything could continue ignore obvious issues filing unemployment shit website importantly pay unemployment...  

If live Florida vote red, stupid motherfucker. know people believe stupid stuff like that, like think majority believe corona virus real thing wearing masks sort political statement. That's really meant. America seems divided whether big hoax (involving countries earth) sent China mess Trump's re-election bid American economy. 

Every country fair share people see conspiracies everywhere. issue places years ago. got de-funded.... unless funded future . happen again. It’s tough! fighting phone also seeing it’s making little impact. Going keep trying though! Umm west virginia moderate spot, less 3000 cases. message opposed to, way delivered. But, hey, maybe that's way get people respond. like collective makes wise decisions part. two doctors state information #In Iceland

This one really bad title, even MBL standards! referring incident wherein infected people entered iceland, disobeyed quarantine rules, arrested shopligting. Three cops involved incident sick. 

Hopefully make full quick recovery infect anyone else. 

But tbh think Iceland would well keep borders closed longer. 

Fun tidbit: Icelandic police adorable Instagram: really shows police force evil. kind news article Facebook post telling people don’t cover noses masks? customers today (rudely) insisted don’t cover nostrils, I’ve literally never pushback before. happen particularly rude stupid customers today, something up? Whyyyy mmmmaaannnn go Florida last week? We’re talking thousands. one’s saying that’s good case study either. Cool Vietnam vs New York! Ok New York may worst country, try California! Florida’s daily death rate basically stagnant total deaths equals happening NY single day. think spare lecture, seem fine. Murica pictures right making basic fitted mask (not pleated) &amp; adding fabric tube middle seam put piece wire in.

I'll try remember take pics &amp; post tomorrow.  keep hearing American people local leaders mention 2nd wave. delusional USA ? well! Cheers! ain't flying anywhere till 2021 can’t appeal people he’s trying convince logic. Couple weeks ago NC made announcement restaurants required report outbreaks. you? really hard move another country. It’s worse that. 5 day beer suspension doesn’t even go effect appeal. Laughable. 🎵🎵macho macho mask! wanna wear macho mask!🤘🏼 People think fake, think exaggerated. live NYC deaths people past average life expectancy diseases. We've HUGE gatherings people wearing masks social distancing (though media denies it) uptick disease. #s fizzling out. That's people tired security theater, see new cases live Australia. Never saw single person wear mask last months. state essentially eradicated COVID-19.

A mask replacement effective public health policy. Lmfao joke Sounds pretty good actually, haha. Well joe Rogan saying wasn’t. that’s need prepare disappointed. US currently hitting highest infection rates date, including prelockdown. makes think thats going suddenly stop? going get worse government basically said done covid. isnt even 2nd wave qualified scientists stated certainly come point. still first wave appears rapidly spreading point cities talking 2nd lockdown. top vaccine even guarantee. Life never go back way was, sorry. say then...say don’t hoard n95 masks...we need healthcare...please get cotton mask supply everyone masks can...don’t fucking lie! I’m even American 🤣 Covid-with-mitigation-efforts killed people 3 months bad flu-with-vaccine kills year. Best luck journey 2020 friend hope best country honestly. worst part many innocent people died maintain US idealism. common sense politicize life saving measures stick libs? ever met flat eather? Serious question never met one. Cruise ships banned Canadian waters October 31st currently stands.   it. 21. easy man, healthy. business. care point. Testing prevent one's death. People treating testing like sort vaccine. reason testing matter much people diagnose Covid-19 still went engaged activities. People care others. Look whole world.. People listening doctors, officials ect. 

People grousing world populated, guess many getting wished for.. reduce population..

**It exact same**.

 mortality rate peaked February started steady decline that, [South peaked death rate - 9 people (yes, 9) - dropped also. 

***It exact pattern world over.*** 

The *only* difference country *is actual number* Covid attributed deaths. wouldn't. I'm UK course think American health care industry medieval, free healthcare cure death. *666g assumes everyone tested. think Delta realized ""Hey, awful lot people infected reported infected!"" would insist everyone getting tested. 2 weeks, right? week husband got back business trip northern Italy February, got sick. symptoms COVID like, testing rare point, want 'waste test' perfect match symptomatically. asymptomatic, went work like everyone else. We're scheduled serologic testing done near future see either us positive.

This running around world way earlier anyone realized. could stopped way sooner States handled better. Thats almost funny. exceed death count predicted, measurable outcome?

Second, increasing evidence outdoors much less risky catching COVID indoors.

Covid good example.  heard many things stated great authority based almost data people claiming scientists.  China CDC Surgeon General Dr Fauci friends.  Go back March Feb see said.  

We still know much. right 1.039.051 cases 2.550.648 tests done reported government. think tests bit higher (but much higher) government already said trouble keeping track  article correct saying 30’s assuming catches it, likely case, 0.2% chance dying. older relatives left hopefully careful around them, age range many things much riskier. lock November thru February flu season people freedom impact air quality however wished, laws smoking restaurants, bars, etc.  trump rallies freedom crowd, please. stop 14 days elections.

*crickets* lockdown, he's already said that. He's scared politicians party going recall first attempt lockdown lol expect morons vote Donald Trump president? wonderful stuff. Remember Brazilians lowest test rates. Therefore, likely cases USA. Maybe 10% population fact (some 20 million people, asymptomatic).

Which kinda implies herd immunity close, mortality death lower implied everyone mass hysteria. use cloth face coverings: children age 2, anyone trouble breathing, unconscious, incapacitated otherwise unable remove mask without start enlistment construction works south? Thats rhetoric lie Pence pushing couple days ago calls state governors. i’m curious US develop herd immunity. know question asked past everyone seemingly throwing caution wind, i’m curious it’s possibility. outdoor activities continue summer i’d assume. openings, protests everyone else seemingly hanging close one another without masks/not social distancing, states refusing make masks mandatory, eventual gatherings presidential rallies... feasible assume good percentage population get it?

Edit: However, believe masks need made mandated reopening anytime soon ensure health safety people. That’s sensible answer. people wear masks take common sense precautions, keep things open keep people businesses making money. quite really vague dick say something false way knowing meant quite few. say ""quite compared elderly"" shut up. see 'lockdown' looks like US south.

the american public said masks actually bad shouldn’t wear admits lying later... wonders americans don’t trust “experts” media. Hey now, claiming right wing people exacerbating virus POLITICAL BIAS CANNOT discussed politics free sub! like it! Still defiant brat age? know vast majority people dying virus.

Source? Yea statistics intuitive, surprised first saw explained well. Glad helpful. Governors, higher up, give excuse explain away increase cases. Anything ""its worse thought would be"". Easier said done. people live pay cheque pay cheque. gonna pay rent, buy food, pay car insurance etc etc etc? workers places like Disneyland literally broke days get paid, cant walk away jobs. Exactly. people tolerate wearing masks long it’s hot. imho Brazil beat US July calling agree would feel better going store honest things. states reopening, happening two months ago, right now. Anything say that, fact lockdowns ""should recommended?"" going harp one singular detail weeks back, corrected, suits warped agenda? Scrappers? forced say interview masks work, play ball Trump's economy-first philosophy mask shortages. least much pure BS, he's working epidemics decades, knows better. could least recommend people wear bandanas use cotton masks, like would eventually recommend weeks later.

March 8:

Fauci: *The masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around masks.*

LaPook: You’re sure it? **people listening really closely this**.

Fauci: *…****There’s reason walking around mask****. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.* 
*\[...\] think masks, think health care providers needing people ill.* Lmao, fox news polls make sense reddit trolls Hmm maybe I'll look could use chest workouts everyone sign waiver, wouldn’t also give least name document? Probably re-election suck dry money appeal letters emails. So, it’s pretty easy get data contact tracing.

Well going opposite direction hope it'll keep going people behave. we'll see. People bored virus, flights cheap, US summer break half country thinks it’s overblown masks pansies.

Apparently covid woke. No, lol. April 3 nearly early enough.

Can ask dead-set trying gaslight us forgetting government misled public masks? competent federal government loaning money states. Simply saying propaganda without following felt propaganda (Nuclear disaster Deaths , hard hide, mention opposition party would field day) really shows IQ. Masks keep respiratory droplets getting people, don’t really protect you. works others also wear masks. Ah, surely right-wing nutbag told Gretchen Whitmer dictator change tune, now. city 125,000. huge case community spread. personally know 2 died 40 infected. can't argue stupidity.

We're talking specifically PNEUMONIA flu deaths suddenly quadrupling reason. excess death, mysterious pneumonia deaths correspond yearly averages. 1029 infected one meat factory thats good East Asian countries end Madagascar/ Greenland. I’d say reacted efficiently comparatively experience SARS. including China.

*Laughs Filipino* asked hill ""reopeners"" choosing die on... explaining. misuse idiom? in-laws got saw firsthand them.

MO red insufficient contact tracing.

My issue labels associated colors. ""Controlled Growth"" yellow many states insufficient contact tracing bit silly. Colorado trending and, yes, co tact tracing low shitty TABOR, still covid well controlled. Bro, 121,000 people died US 463,000 total. compassion fellow human. “Plan” bit generous, no? ""save"" DACA. 

Roberts said screwed-up procedure gave roadmap actually get rid it. I’ve noticed Trump pissed Fox News recently, polls, Fox New polls seem indicate population aren’t complete morons. Yeah, know :/ Yeah pretty trashy, responses ""Santa real"", ""do know alphabet"" etc really classy either dude. trashy, arguing something pretty simple much hatred insults.

I think governor's logic. Nice. 

That joke. sure it’s getting downvoted. website banned here? Yup. decision backfired mistake. People still hoarded masks people still think useless it. decisions pandemic US poor, believe biggest mistake. That’s generous use term “scientist”. state testing easily? went got tested Tuesday hermit rest week wouldn’t distanced Father’s Day. Yes people boomers, doesn’t really *feel* like loss. Yes, priorities completely opposite. People favelas stand chance. horrible. Can't get reinfected dead. Texas: big enough, can't trusted. Trust California.  Yes I’ve saying get-go. credible epidemiologist stated beginning: takes rounds infection (each 2-3 weeks) see results mitigation measures lifted. exactly seeing south (places opened what... 7ish weeks ago?) unfortunately probably expect see northeast 6-8 weeks since starting reopen... Predicted whom? period time? even play Clemson? First people confederate parade don’t take enough precautions keep players healthy? school bad, especially you’re black!  Alberta? rarely see people masks here, neighbour huge backyard party day. 

No one seems get wear mask it’s benefit, mine. need get idea work. 

Sigh. Interesting that’s never talked 

This huge disaster nursing homes found 5 guys recently. want use drive through, noticed people eating indoors. like ate hood car. “As May 19, Sweden coronavirus deaths per capita country Europe.” 

TIL Italy isn’t part Europe. Yo, big thanks baristas putting shit. don’t deserve get dumped all. Going Starbucks one outings make keep sane days. No, cases deaths directly related. see, cases increasing deaths decreasing. evidence tall claims made? already countries reduced spread virus point relatively safe reopen screenings incoming people. could absolutely fight people gave fuck. sovereign citizens respond tell serve REGULAR AMERICANS. curious; seems like it'd ruffle feathers. regardless whether he's younger foolish, he's utter imbecile.

Makes sense. shame even needs said, legions SwedenTards sub keep coming excuses murderous policy. won't. wait till see bars NYC Jersey. reason I'm cause family makes substantial amount money would make anywhere else. I've multiple citizenships trust I'd part top. way fucking hell. please ever reproduce almost guarantee significant decline age infections, rather confirmed cases. I’m sure average age people getting infected also gone risk population likely continuing take precautionary measures less risk population longer taking. However, decrease likely much smaller looking confirmed/tested number. Maybe FEMA resell shady intermediary half price, shady intermediary fill crap resell 5x non-lethal crowd control ammo. know location exposed? Two reasons. horror outbreaks forced population accept ""social distancing"" population accept ""social distancing"" already got infected. simply true. Lockdowns aspect mitigation efforts supposed temporary goal flattening curve. Masks social distancing need utilized vaccine effective treatment. 

That said, I’m also young unmarried. already started *safely* socializing outdoors. It’s hard I’m selfish enough demand terms socializing pandemic. *Checks notes written Crayon*

Duh. SW Ohio here, mask wearing well 50% population. It’s conservative area, people don’t like told do. now, we’re getting spoke cases. Yay...

If people wore masks, wouldn’t spikes. could knock quicker, could get life like normal. no, people selfish. New York State never range either and, since similar populations, you’ve effectively proved point. Florida feel you...can’t believe governor said another lockdown. much “safe, smart, step-by-step”. whole thing makes mad. sort hope minute. medical funding not. need verified positive results. anyone flown this? We’re supposed flying 3 kids (6,4, 10 months) Alaska Sunday June 28th. much anxiety it. scheduled receive test Thursday flights. We’re visiting elderly grandparents able meet third baby. Obviously less risky us fly nervous all. We’ve isolating since March 11th, seeing parents entire time go isolation plane feels scary. 

The flight capped 65% capacity middle rows booked I’m hoping kind make difference? Idk. sucks. priviledge

However, want get month 6 month 18? longer delay ever getting means better chance treatment understanding virus. blood clots they’ve found autopsies freaking scary wouldn’t even know something happens clots. even simpler things like people losing sense taste smell. hell would want either? 1 million cases bit 2 million tests seems quite high positive rate 🤔. numbers match I'm seeing reported covidtracking.com. We've averaged 25K tests per day week.  opening everything complete disregard science medical advice bad idea, way. Gatekeeping compassion now? Thanks reminding us steps ~~grieving~~ grifting process. Lazy and/or selfish. believe covid perhaps? see lot lazy though, workers mask nose breath better, even Subway restaurant. 2 customers going go w/o mask saw sign door requiring went car put mask then. basically people giving crap. Sad talk adults like children get bare minimum protect one another. Airport security even different takes place designated areas enforced people guns. People going stay restaurant long spending money. 

You've obviously never worked restaurant business. NEVER ask table leave they're spending money. 

You also seem understand people well all---and think businesses sorts power ""require"" people things. properly run poll representative sample larger population trying represent. news polls, especially website polls something talk about, especially news networks actually admit oath entertainment news.

But try spread demographic's political viewpoints ask, get equal representation everyone, get proportional representation relative larger population trying model. Sample size relative overall population size even used calculate margin error. Serious errors suggest skewed data sample population representative whole. Also, leading questions skew data (great president, greatest president? example).

Tl;dr: depends taking poll much interested accuracy, speed, cost, cases, polling bad faith present case. no, shows ok, ensuring mass infections young people could never infect old people around them! smart!!! analogy use mass shooting event Las Vegas years ago.

we fixated fatality count. 58 killed became *the number*.

but fired 1,000 rounds. *413* wounded gunfire. suffered wounds organs bones....they probably 100 percent. give Trump credit comparing scientist. 

He putting significant risk well since majority participants breath vapor wafting down. nothing magic 6 feet, significant number infected arena get well Oh agreed, tax value land, otherwise underdeveloped! good boot licking right here. quite honest, Canada absolutely fine merely 100 cases day less little while. say fuck open everything once, kinda get back soon. USA borders still pretty much closed people kind still trying adopt good practices (at least I'm from). Unless things know, quite good place try open bits bits.

If opened month ago would said otherwise, bad, seeing bad southern border doing. High speed chase, that’s hilarious. gonna do, take back roads back Miami? they’re selfish. Simple as. It’s enraging time physician Facebook. Definitely thought biden flag... Wow. extraordinarily depressing silver lining. Florida fine, new cases we’re testing now. /s think that's stupid, so-called advanced nation history unable enforce widespread use masks citizens God given American right selfish, ignorant fucks? develop vaccine half county refuses take scared Bill Gates autism? about? I'm saying they're stupid. part math incorrect? New Jersey. Even true, choose drive seldom affected. COVID, can't choose participate.

And many us would rather see less able - know, old, young, sick - die selfishness.

Yeah, I'm 38 year old athletic male healthy lungs rowed 10km 100 burpees yesterday.

But know people interact daily basis? Many less able me. old receptionist. People heart lung disease. old man grocery store. Kids. People without immunity strong cardiovascular system.

I'm yet willing say let go hell. goes even that. counties done poorly even state whole well. First deaths month? It’s enemy weak poses almost literally zero threat “strong”. 

Elderly people obese people careful, rest us go business. hysteria ridiculous. It’s dems fault. try argue BLM protests riots nothing increase cases... ""it's reopen protests."" every one saw showed social distancing masks. Saw little BLM protests. Yes distinguished initial patients flu patients led testing. testing

Nope, number new cases places like Florida Arizona far outstripping increase number tests (which mostly flat). see positive rate, gone way states. avg age fallen 37 67.

Thank Sometimes breaking record *bad*. Seems well understood, everyone constantly chasing one! One dream What? hell would family members unplugged ventilator? would unplug anything hospital? party, ? country far diverse media outlets voting patterns that. 

There Trump voters listen NPR. LOVE THY FUCKING NEIGHBOR LOVE I'd recheck math, bud

And BTW state 3000 deaths people 70? almost like people hanging outside states southern states seen triple digit temperature days (pushing people congregate inside ac) seeing cases rise.. I'll forever amazed something simple, somehow turned political stance almost. Imagine scenario, seatbelts instead. People would hear and, obvious reasons, laugh notion. Expendables: Political Edition Sure does. People sitting room talking, sneezing, coughing, laughing expel particulate air far wider six feet. 

Try think. thank sacrifice. forgotten. cow urinate effort save patient? think apply basic common sense see stupid conspiracy theories are. unfortunately lot people seem lack common sense. GGO specific COVID19 really special kind stupid want go cruise conservative activist euphemism pos? 40/M fit preexisting conditions day 142. Much better lungs sporadically decide work correctly. nowhere feels like are...itchy lose 40-50% lung capacity. Hard explain feeling. Irritation almost like itch. Lasts 10-15 minutes. I've started taking nebulizer everywhere. Low grade fever times. 99.4-100 degrees. 142 days 138 days since thought fully recovered worst symptoms cleared quickly. Three rounds antibiotics touch it. Absolutely nuts. think might permanent. pretty much every comment pointing falling death rates. 

Anyway, previous hotspots (NY, NJ) falling, new hotspots getting going terms cases deaths follow later. 

It's strange there's magical thinking again, cases translate deaths. feel like back int earlier part year people magically thought ""ehh, get hit virus country"" whatever logical reason. affect personally going restaurants bars.

I know details protocols, seems

* constitutional right sit hours dining room. Restaurants set time limits dining. set policy well. recall last time ate (this pre-pandemic), dining room posted 45 minute limit.
* Policy require diners mask (necessitating stop eating drinking) wait staff present. waiter might ask distance whether need drink refills. answer yes, waiter waits guys mask approaching table refilling drinks. waiter done left may demask resume enjoying meal.
* Even right patrons masked minutes unmasked hours, ""accomplishing nothing"". nothing else wait staff remain masked entire shift. alone significant worthwhile. spread much? mask guess. . Brilliantly said!!! also young people like kids juvenile autoimmune diseases. deserve die already lost genetic lottery older person deserves loose one day much less years life! America relies brain drain keeping advantage top industry, current trajectory diminish. recovery rates higher infection rates . That's thing hope **China:** Scientific based responses. Quarantine lockdown affected area. Maintain good level food, water energy supplies lockdown.  Massive tracing testing. Encourage enforcing social distancing mask wearing. 

.

**Brazil:(mostly president)** Denial coronavirus. Hardly quarantine/lockdown affected area. meeting tracing testing required. encouraging enforcing social distancing mask wearing.

The guys MR house problem wearing required... didnt COVID seem saying. arent anecdotes. quite foolish destroy base support opinion Scary thought: people COVID attendance naturally spread. president, divisive way, go twitter claiming far-left radicals entered rally spread COVID purpose incredible right wing base, furthering divide Americans. 

I know sounds wall sane person, that’s dealing here. Would decent ventilation fix that? lot public areas naturally ventilated. guess downside increasing airflow buildings would require energy probably increase heating/cooling needs. Ok still wear one FREEDOM course. even visible now. really interesting 4 words chose get briefing. check make exceptions conditions. executive order state specifically exempts mental physical health disorders disabilities. Hell... I'll honest: would want plane right unless 1/3rd full everyone wearing masks. Full stop there. Well here, let's see flag COVID-19's manager. let know concerns ask plan wind operations. What's crazy given crowd size, even say .01% audience die, 20 people. 

It literally equivalent bringing 20 people stage, shooting head front cheering crowd chanting ""USA USA USA TRUMP!"". lucky people pushed back. restaurant, qhich pretty tame crowd overall, get several people day fighting us masks. One person today claimed free citizen (I think nut jobs believe laws) finally agreeing put mask seated told server ""I really wanted kill you."" Superb health system could another factor.

*Read article.* Everyone fine strange article April 6 seems say opposite

Its Opposite, take together see people cardiac symptoms stopped showing hospitals died homes, afraid go hospitals afraid getting corona.

 would expect doctors see less cases hospitals time deaths increasing homes, articles agree True. Peru locked mid march technically still lockdown till end june. still decrease cases... Reasons? 70% economy informal workers access social security arent registered many finantial aids goverment given. Lots people work street either selling stuff crowded marks. Seems weird cos havent seen even one person doesnt mask yet still fucked. Seems trend. Guess can’t magically wish away. Need plan. Yeah, say ignoring science nothing new pandemic, matter, exclusive Americans. Put people risk stroke ego?

No, assumes mitigation policies available besides lockdown, blatantly false. South Korea, instance, never lockdown Germany. Furthermore, lockdowns created equal.

Additionally, countries made sure financial assistance readily available duration lockdown.

I'm curious Turnout universal low reckon they're thinking worth reopening soon. know gamer things hard process, let's break down.

Outdoors masks = lower risk

Indoors masks = high risk Same. Late Feb, early March negative flu tests. I'm teacher students schools really freaking sick. never followed covid test bc atleast month available. antibody test yesterday though blood work. Hope explains feel like shit freaking time.

New York average 301 new daily cases last three days. three days protests average 583 new daily cases. 

Not NY decrease cases weeks protests, significantly lower number new cases Arizona. 

New York many much larger BLM protests Arizona. protests responsible numbers seeing Arizona, seeing much much larger numbers New York, case. Remind me! 2 weeks yeah 4 month old throwaway account ""leftists"" Yeah, would air place soon get opening window.

If truly paranoid bring container wipes wipe common surfaces bathroom, door knobs, ect. think people picture count high. Hollywood could stop making movie year two, mind. use escrow read description items buying carefully Freakin' knuckleheads. I'm really scared getting sick personally, felt like extra-cautious case crossed paths healthcare workers senior-care workers. geeze, gotta part. Yeah true, pretty clear graph track flattening curve since daily infection rate clearly going down.

Ah shit, phone upside again. It’s super frustrating. hate Arizona right now. situation country? Things pretty much back normal netherlands besides restrictions NYC happen? subways, sure. walking Williamsburg counted 56/160 wearing masks got bored. Also, restaurants door seating last Friday (breaking rules) even 10 percent people wearing masks crowded. parks. course couldn’t wipe everything, wiped surfaces, doorknobs, light switches, chairs, inside dressers, etc tried avoiding touching anything didn’t need two days. think point isn’t much reserve explosion cases leads patients hospitalized scary. LOT states showing kind growth.

New York City benefit able move resources around easier states things continue trend poorly. think masks non-starter event. Kind pointless. closed venue, probably bad ventilation large venues have, crowd whipped frenzy long time. Would probably reduce contamination somewhat, ethical thing course event all, mask mask.  Exactly. There’ll plenty people contract enforce cognitive bias. “See went, didn’t wear mask, I’m fine”. gets real pass relative gets sick. Boomers. many Rallies planned? shut one?

Yeah like football live :/ Regardless intent gives impression event goers it’s theater rally happen without [legal] issue doesn’t really matter. case ""future"" length pandemic. Honestly, I've felt like bit pariah American Europe since middle Bush years. remember back 80s 90s everyone seemingly loved Americans. That's bullshit. talked DIRECTLY positive test percentage. Fuck automod. think federal government power make face masks mandatory. would entirely states set law enforce it. Yeah, might even take 2-3 years, decade much. I’ve following closely since January. opinion hasn’t formed vacuum. think explain killing people bad pointing masks make difficult solve crimes? right cases. don’t get point. Yeah agree. also seems random. I’ve posts don’t even mention party anyone specific get auto removed keep reading thread find whole rant you-know-who it’s removed.  Donald Trump figured yet risk anyone else rallies? Can’t imagine getting hospitalized Coronavirus would good odds November Seems would make sense close churches beaches then. However people need able keep practicing religion emotional well people need keep activities outside physical mental well being. Instead let’s wear mask inside public buildings. Please keep conversation topic Coronavirus (i.e., relates Covid-19, derail off-topic political conversations) keep comments civil.

**Wishing celebrating harm/death 14 day ban, thread locked types comments.** Basically New York/Lombardy level infection. I’m sure fine universe hates poetic justice folks, bunch fit young people walking outside wearing masks different situation bunch unhealthy older people inside wearing masks. may never develop vaccine (or maybe do, various new strains year like seasonal flu).

I think today's world amount travel dense groups different populations (one may attend concert bunch people they'll never see again, go church bunch people, university classroom, etc.), can't fathom we'd eradicate it.

Which say, stay. going get used adapt.

FWIW, family still cautious point. Things starting open back community, we've staying home time being. well aware endpoint mindset, September latest children return school. literally can't help themselves. Outdoors heavy mask usage vs 19k indoors. even close. honestly understand blind idiocy people have, I'm talking attending.

Some people evolved beyond Middle Ages. BIG GRETCH!! NC: V E Thank you. 

Makes wonder sort security detail that. Chuck people coughing, refuse entry people don’t fit R image, surveillance listen conversation kick dissidents. Wouldn’t put past ‘em. sure going active. I'm hoping we'll vaccine and/or find proper treatment methods year two.  feel you, saw 4 healthcare workers without masks Publix day. freaking wild here. highly doubt going lockdown another month two. Disease support groups online attract bit identification sick role think probably healthy. Never mind people standing line infectious person waiting get in. saying shutdown social distancing poses problems mass gatherings thousands. Completely agree. situation probably couldn’t handled worse has. Seeing what’s going makes looking fall winter seem grim. Remember, would attacked guidelines based science, nearing lull leading inevitable spike come fall/winter. lull, headed another spike cold months. oh give up? Like right away? one extreme other? Makes absolutely sense pandemic. probably thousand ways handle this. like 4 like ""I give up"". country empathy common sense. Enough extremes. Well, least someone's gettin' it. Closing 122k dead Americans. need individual stories like people getting numb. honestly didn’t even know face masks weren’t mandatory here. Granted don’t go often, I’ve seen people wearing masks Bay Area. I’m guessing it’s different story SoCal. Hm, sort see you’re saying. 

I thought wanted wide-spread testing, no? Otherwise, ones getting tested? Thanks. Hope get conclusive results one way another July end study linked. 

Agree it’s hard draw conclusions participants drop out. know surgisphere Lancet study published; many trials halted. Lancet issued retraction; late damage done. look posts comments. Looks like garbage see certain family members Facebook, Indian. Good Lord, propaganda astounding. seem misinterpreting plan. trying minimize Covid cases, care.

I'm suburbs Ft Lauderdale I'm extremely fortunate employer letting us work home indefinitely. local authorities also mandating face coverings every time I've groceries, people seem respect order. coffee fatty foods? haven’t heard any, least large clusters. Police though - yes. Several stories infected. 249 million go. I'm sure many nursing homes still zero COVID infections think worthwhile lesson take article series common sense steps, taken early enough, make significant difference.

eg: Masks dispensed residents. Community meals eliminated, residents ate rooms. Employees provided food would go lunch dinner. Rooms one television two residents got second TV help meet social distancing.

None rocket science require right attitude buy-in everyone involved. Yes go home rallies protests infect friends family. It’s lose/lose situation everyone. Since day 1 thought whole war masks selfish people rallying behind excuse **MILDLY** inconvenience themselves, nothing else. bet OK data covid past rally somehow obfuscated.  AKA Sheep I’d feel super wary it. I’m pro vaccines, don’t feel great using vaccine developed country virus originated, kept hidden long. don’t trust entirely. Would prefer vaccine US different country.

Nothing Chinese people. Chinese government. Though technically accurate... “Dozens” word would choose describe amount college stadiums. Just... wow! overall point? never said he's ""god science"" whatever mean. point based what's happening States moment: example, Federal Government, State Governments, citizens managed politicize masks freedom problem instead protective public health measure. lot research coming masks one best methods fighting pandemic, yet people go: ""MUH FREEDUMB.""

So yes, general sentiment USA reject certain scientific knowledge.  new cases younger people 40. less likely hospitalized generally much less likely die overall. Still, means interacting society large could spreading older people.  Surely coincidence one states hit hard early. whole experience convinced American take climate change seriously even it’s late. Probably say it’s democratic hoax. it’s 5G. giant petri dish Oh wow. Per capita we’re number 4? seeing correctly? nursing home peaked 51 cases 140 residents. 0 week. we're back 1 suspect rise.

We also followed pretty much guidelines nursing home every nursing home. visitors. Nobody allowed outside room even mask. single rooms. dining room anymore, eat rooms. Employees assigned one unit stay unit enter others, separate break rooms unit. Still spread like wildfire. Thanks Riverside Orange Cty 23 0 hospitalizations, that’s good thing. really valid reason.

It’s like pneumonia. It’s usually something comes goes. everyone. life long damage. It’s rare, happens. 

That doesn’t mean vast majority don’t complete recovery

There’s reason think mild cases virus different respiratory virus $5k fine... $50 gonna anything. Vietnam. Fauci also told Americans reason wear masks, expect. Ya it’s almost like definitions use guide language use said international crisis alert people say pandemic wasn’t countries. Fucking scientists tell want hear  Again, misses point. point shouldn’t cost $1.1m either individual insurance company Medicare taxpayer. 

Obviously healthcare cost something — it’s expensive you’re trying provide high quality service highly trained workers compensated commensurate training. $1.1m ridiculous.  valid firearm license forbidden wearing mask public carrying weapon.

So choose wear mask carry firearm.

By passing law requires people something prohibits carrying firearm, violating Second Amendment. argued parents ( 61) going out. father still work, employer set stations everyone safe. 
  shopping pick ups beginning march till 2 weeks go cases dropped 100 day 1500 beginning. went groceries last week moms response shock amount people older mask following distancing.

I'll bet whole crew already got jabbed Moderna like 2 weeks ago.... Scumbags. Thank you.. wondering 5-10min groceries know chance:) true, we'll still get takeout. experiences far around town online community fb page covid older people bitching masks, demanding things open up, calling virus hoax know unfortunately little bubble I'm surrounded that's experience throughout whole thing. medical condition constant stream bullshit flows mouth. Well least admit unless marxist agitator freaks. NY 1164 new today. already suffered enough second wave. getting really depressing. **Translation** (summarized)

Ministers adopted recommendations Corona Cabinet gave green light hold shows performances restrictions. number participants event limited 250 people 75% occupancy - must wear mask time. Audience information kept case Corona patient discovered

The government approved phone relief cultural world. Ministry Culture said Friday possible hold concerts, shows, well open cinemas. new conditions, mask-wearing duty remains throughout performance film breaks allowed.

The number participants performances may exceed 250 persons, maximum occupancy 75% volume hall performance held. time possible standing shows performances include dancing participants.

The sale tickets shows done advance, telephone digital order, marked seats only. Viewers' phone numbers kept accordance designated seating locations 20 days, forwarded Ministry Health event Corona patient discovered.

Increasing participants 500 examined later, subject morbidity data.

""They fill 75% occupancy, groups friends couples buy tickets together, considered capsule sit next other. one chair separating groups, entrance heat measurements, need wear masks breaks shows."" Yup. get annoyed see people masks chin. One big warnings beginning keep taking putting masks we’d prone spreading germs. know germs last hours surfaces (metal one think) city like NY supposed stay healthy. Hopefully science answers soon fingers crossed 🤞 see lot really think recirculation air problem. opinion, dangerous situation ""down wind"" someone shedding virus.

No one gives shit me. want something. Oh nice . Im also computer scientist. Congrats getting statewe 72% ICU beds full Well, almost certainly would get dismissed. Karen already reposted Facebook.  Pretty sure there’s gonna vaccine long evolves survive outdoors guy three weeks. places see renewed restrictions closings? California instituted mandatory masks. Anything else noteworthy? prime minister NRW said he's ruling locking affected region completely.

So hope response goes well general. Trump totally going win thank wonderful two party first past post voting system. deaths days get marked coronavirus wether heroin overdose natural causes. covid19 patended everytime outside news someone filmed thier local hospital empty testing sites also empty.

Hospitals need doctors nurses. they're provided work conditions need operate safely, every right strike. would impossible replace nurses, would much likely powers would move every obstacle way meet demands. clearly asking nicely working.  interesting part state releasing age ranges comorbidities new infections. Old sick people getting infected? Uh oh. Young healthy people?

Sure, someone pass tests, pass bar exam, always mean they're good lawyer?

That's even touching potential schools incentive students graduate. Way see it, less graduates look bad, looking bad leads less people wanting attend, means less money end. I'm sure that's every university, I've learned anything this, comes profits money lot time sadly.

I've seen lots conflicting information know right answer is, recent literature I've seen says sufficient evidence face masks help prevent spreading virus. e.g. Racists can't hide anymore. want called racist? one.

Guess 2MM cases isn’t biggie legit flew American airlines Wednesday worn mask get airport TSA let lady front without either medical note mask (of neither) made get mask site joke. entire story jagoff fluffing temporary low numbers. Might well political piece saying ""it's over. Go back work play"" Reported. security assault doctor once? 10% sick need hospitalization, that's 1K hospital admissions per day. Shutdown never happen again, we’ve realized trolley problem. nothing old/sick people die, change course much young healthy people’s lives ruined Well, Earth told us prefers. bot bot bot Funny China/Vietnam/South Korea/Taiwan etc data efficacy masks US/EU didn't, it? Stop trying excuse inexcusable. hospitals collapsing means? sick people can't treated hospital full?
 would define hospital collapse? Yep, suffering work noun :)

In English, -ing ending turn verb something called gerund, verb acts like noun. Like, ""Her singing beautiful."" ""That's nice drawing."" Problem line reasoning HIPPA ADA laws... They've got right ask obligation disclose. fact, may illegal even ask medical condition is; see service animal situation. Good. Need that! Yeah also happens respiratory diseases, especially elderly patients.

It eventually gets noticed but... way, way late. 10-20% severe hyperbole. Considering least 70% population needs immunity herd immunity take place, talking 1/7 2/7 every covid patient developing long-term lifelong damage heart lungs 10-20% population develop issues. 

Based existing studies, 10-20% number seem exaggerated all. actually live Houston? Tell wrong admit may things may know.  last incumbent lose George Senior. Carter. faced significant domestic economic headwinds.

However, terms enthusiasm challenger, Mondale Kerry ring bells well. They.all respective primaries “only man left”, demoralized base. light, people voting Biden simply voting Trump, winning formula.

In view, DNC cut nose Democratic Party spite it’s face decade now. suffered candidates popular support advance, chances winning General would almost assured. Obama last candidate put forward nature, would remiss mention Clinton lock ‘08, calculus changed Edwards dropped race turned 3rd place runner lead. That's happened.

The president literally read daily intelligence reports gets. plenty time ramp production masks. person I'm pretty sure can't actually read leading country. intentional fuck up. Covid reports since us ever knew. thanks. I’ll keep outdoor, mask hangs. Good point. Thanks man Public support Sweden leaders risky strategies far high. I've calling Sweden's approach Reddit since march. Got lots patriotic rebuttals lockdowns work Sweden come top. New York threaten Rhode Island proposing something similar. Great. ""Jabbed"" drug trials yet become sterile develop cancer. Calling now, fists flying Monday. Good thing pandemic happen Endgame set release. would insane. Circumcision done 3 reasons:

* Medically necessary. rarely happens.

* religious reasons, please nebulous god nobody's ever seen.

* curtail masturbation non-procreative sexual pleasures, usually done religious reasons. See previous point.

Sorry, 4 reasons:

* people personal reasons. sexes cosmetic surgery done improve perceived aesthetic looks, like nose job. *can* truth... Doctors scientists. surprise.  Technically George wasn’t born country all. logic doesn’t exist. matter much keep repeating stuff, it’s true. even Autistic people. hang one us. depends specific sensory issues person might have. :-)  I'm genuinely curious see results. general, think make true generalizations millions people based nothing kind biological feature? problems children front. stuff tho, man... sound like Melissa McCarthy's impression Sean Spicer trying explain Muslim ban ban. Qatar really deaths

Really *reported* deaths. can't imagine they're anymore transparent Corona deaths World Cup migrant worker deaths. nothing else wake call people able comfortably ignore glaring problems nation now. There's certain type person struggles compassion empathy tend ignore dismiss issues personalty impact often putting blame people suffering. there's plenty suffering go around, I'm hoping least people forced change thinking. unpopular opinion Fauci necessarily WYSIWYG . spoken media hundreds times offers confusing tidbits information knows spun convey narrative. 

Here could easily said science pursuit truth. chose phrasing others use make fun “pompous scientists” Hilarious 😆 “Gay conservative”.

Just another way saying “self hating”. HDU, inhale virus infect myself! Better spread everyone else! /s ""Looks like cases going down!""

- Dumdums early March Arizona, Florida, exc... 2021? Really? Tons confirmation studies ignored modern ignorance Crabs everyone! Imagine 1984 described world could get people believe anything without need coercion, would make propaganda videos without even asked. 

And would believe obvious falsehoods strongly would argue behalf town square accuse sensible, smart people critical thinking skills sheeple. Well takes bit everyone get vaccine plus always end order early masks longer needed. DeSantis ruining lot lives abysmal leadership get 1? Especially idiocy seems. Fine, put jail then. doubt home acs problem. like centralized ac units workplaces stores. close indefinitely spring True. would useful know, exposure cabins lots people frequent use hotels. Still, general public underestimates cleanliness cabin air, especially plane flying. 

I vaguely remember hearing outbreak among luggage handlers, presumably infected touching many bag handles.  floor us. Yeah kn95 personal use, it’s okay good n95s though. One side seems much sharply inclined wear masks congregate outdoors, current spikes mostly Trumper-land Bible belt. Coincidentally, FL AZ entitled idiots I've ever encountered.  disagree masks don’t much, covid gonna spread airplane matter there's vaccine then.. says something obvious, people criticize them, says something misleading, people criticize them. like can't win! majority cases Marion, OH, prison. 2,000 cases 20 deaths prison. 12 deaths nursing homes. Considering congregate living situation, that's actually good news surviving virus. number cases Marion County low. 8 cases least week Source outbreak: meatpacking plant. 7000 employees sent quarantine.

Till Friday afternoon 3500 employees tested, 803 positive 463 negative results. remainder still processed.

Edit: I... ammmm..... Kiiiiiddd....... Rockkkkk Yep. Houston area done less tests compared beginning month positivity rate skyrocketing. eh, isnt like he'll live long enough pay off. basically non-issue  Unbelievable. Every article masks represent one feel wearing one - wasn’t fuck feelings crowd? still coddling freaking people like they’re toddlers let choose sippy cup want feel like control environment don’t tantrums supermarket? really obvious thing say. People strike stop work afford live without getting paid, circumstances employment become untenable. comforted respect shown live (not USA). line check-out, coffee queue train station, get happy nod person standing 2 metres behind you, quiet acknowledgment it’s farted.  hadn’t thought that. social distance large class sizes? don’t see work. understand angle, make sense reality. RCT serology study, testing active infections done aim finding infections.

Problem example X, Y, Z happen 20 full states. Even worse, could make strong case half under-testing majorly yet still consistently breaking records case numbers increasing positivity rates. Lockdowns/masks/distancing serve flatten curve, end virus.

if stop spread, virus dies population matter weeks

yes, flattening curve important initial spike, since there's vaccine sight, wore masks social distanced/quarantined like supposed to, outbreak would pretty much like countries. virus needs new host continue spreading, stop feeding new hosts die last person recovers dies actually support idea. long Trump goes staff MAGA Americans. leader! Serious question. dick. different massive protests? it’s indoors? sub run ground. soo good whole American political agenda arrived. guys get shit together. Every subreddit sides one american agenda. Usually liberal. boy get rage shit show us right now.

This sub, however, exclude US-politics. honest even super admin, would solution. can't really figure non-us-politics posts get green flag without horde people pay,

Its sad. info gained here. least dig wayyy deep.

Tell me: fuck care chris rock? Yes, calling lies calling gaslighting make feel better. Potus said use UV body. saying use disinfect surfaces people there. lol Unfortunately, I'm extremely consistent.

I'm glad found insightful! People idiots booking August quote president claims ""best testing machine history!"" single case live month, still wear mask. still ongoing, there's even small chance could spread it, I'd like lower risk. Countries gonna buy Chinese vaccine without thoroughly testing specifications. don’t think untested Chinese vaccine presented people. Or@nge M@n didn’t help, making masks politic@l win baseball championship year two ago?

Anyway, school that's thirsty national championship again, we'd take 2020 no-football-actually-played consolation prize end 40 year drought. people take month die. Deaths increase even new cases dropping long delay onset death. virus seems take longer two weeks really ramp up, likely percentage infected asymptomatic mildly ill. Americans follow anything... even science. Maricopa County required it. metro Phoenix included that. Anything better nothing. (Usually) can't fix persons life problems. let know risks privacy someone secretly recording zoom session exactly risk therapist hiding hidden camera recording sessions.

That all. pretend able comment information, context, experience.

Have good one hope something gets better soon. Except it’s respiratory virus. finding quickly. It’s pulmonary virus invade lungs. never seen virus like naive narcissistic assume know anything. know would hilarious imprisoned indefinitely without trial. way black people every day. show lack freedom really feels like Dont worry. used fears plain outbreak nyc. like space run asshole. letting pass enough. Wear mask visor gloves. SPray yur shoes soap alcohol leave door, little things add make difference. well going street see people sidewalk,. purpose shame people dont wear masks. Darwin important remember 96.5% home remain home, though. certain number end hospital, symptoms progressed severity yet. Depends power output.
Honestly would efficient less expensive wipe things class starts. UV generally used research keep sterile stations sterile times, bulbs lamps get pretty expensive. know positive tests going up. know percent positive going up. going anything it? see little corrective action done.  vast majority people play Russian roulette one time fine.  really sure means anything  Well it’s yet true. girlfriend (22)began getting symptoms, first dry cough couple days later got fever. decided self-quarantine, would take daily 2 days got really bad. said difficult breathe felt time going really slow, breaths erratic deep. One night took emergency tested came back positive, culonavirus Well , thanks guess? tend stick guns. proof , facts. well, made mistake. know. Fair enough. least, celebrate milestone getting far. :) mean, technically “us” didn’t create electoral college, majority “us” support abolishing it. panic attack respirator today! definitely sucked. Especially people wanted take mask of, like hell gonna get gold covid Olympics sure It’s real issue PSAP’s. 3 confirmed two potential exposures. larger center, maybe huge deal. potential. RIP condolences family. there's never vaccine what? End society? Academics ivory towers...  Whatever makes feel better. wasn’t serious would horrible  Like vaccines touted ready ""late year"" ""early next year"" course nobody going put exact date thier vaccines ready. Yes. 100% that! 

Unfortunately, see lots people wearing masks shore points. Understandably, may fine sand, boardwalks, becomes mix mask wearers non wearers. experience weeks back. sure now, imagine people shore. Probably Memorial Day. pretty packed since then.   Thanks sacrifice, coach. told give grandma economy. generous here, giving ventilator. finally admit mistake -- great.

And yeah, lots mistakes lot people. noticed extensive gaslighting campaign sub like mask thing. People seem really dedicated making us forget government health agencies lied. That's probably agenda here: gaslighting. Well dont read entire thread make comments. read post make comment necessary, I'm sorry read thing 3 times lol also hard gut digest, better eating steamed veggies, many veggies better digested lightly cooked  That's cute, wait India. population massive country open. Heard pretty much thing beginning March Spain, rest known. could mean? Better yet make CGI-aged Chris Evans tell wearing one kill grandpa Captain America.  Clearly don't. you, 10 years old? sounds petty. I'm celebrating loss life.  = Interner Explorer Maybe let happen. problem might take care itself... doomerish, probably worst time since April so. Lots people guard think problem anymore. That's exactly becomes problem again. slight trim pension obligations may make substantially higher annual pension obligation expense going forward, since lower interest rates mean contributed yearly. wait increase body count eat words. weeks. meantime, ignore calls safety precautions numbers rise. feeling resurgence higher body count states taking fewest precautions getting hit now. low prevalence, false positives much likely That’s kinda carried California Arizona Texas Florida like earlier northeast rust belt April think extreme Canada US. think deaths nursing homes/long term care facilities Canada. I've seen ~50% US. American Airlines private business. dioshit would ok denying service gay people right, telling must wear mask wishes travel plane assault freedoms....fucking conservative douchebag view, anything government *cannot* force do? Brazil crushed us yesterday day seems like he’s saying something stark contrast something he’s said day two prior. 



Can give couple examples?  wore masks, hes high risk begin due diabetes. Getting others wear mask another thing. ""The Close Talker."" Jays need play games Canada elsewhere. Florida. 

Maybe Buffalo instead. would probably better phrased ""science humankind's best means ascertaining truth,"" process flawed, particular work good data first place, good testing protocols important.

I think larger point stands though. worry movement deliberate ignorance. ""There'd [detected] cases test much."" mean, true, change actual suffering death caused virus. Stone Cold Steve Austin took photo IG wearing mask. [Even Multiple reports people who’ve testing positive  concede first point, since full quote (supposedly) contained element wear masks exclusively political statement, way prove someone wearing Biden-supporting mask wearing make statement, vs also wearing prevent spread virus. 

But ""come on, take mainstream media sources word,"" agree disagree. unprecedented dishonesty mainstream ""news"" outlets POTUS, surprise surprise, never get wrong favor, always - L W - error expense, exact intend paint unfavorable light. Every single time. still coddling freaking people like they’re toddlers let choose sippy cup want feel like control environment don’t tantrums supermarket?

Because election year. There’s lot issues serological surveys. agree infected known. Mine 90/60 years. 150/100 recently. resting heart rate, normally 50-60, spiked 160. Weekly average deaths dropped 150 though I’m planning getting ASAP That’s us. Electoral college democratic system government. may like it’s law know cases trending week two shouldn’t seeing increased deaths month ago? They’re still trending down.

Edit: people hate sub. Someone asking question get downvoted oblivion. Gotta bring chem-trails too! really true Brazil conducted 2.3 million tests higher ? busiest seen downtown. literally feels like everything back normal. nuts. Compassion? asshats aren’t wearing masks going motivated compassion. were, they’d already wearing masks. 

Make mandatory. Add nasty fines get progressively worse violators. point admitted previously lying? Men huge dicks wear face masks. known. swear, it’s like I’m writing comment different forms,

You can’t suffer depression you’re dead tho. good man, couple hours ago lol  Stay home then. protests area almost protesters wearing masks people arguing closed height simply sacrificed elderly good economy. Eh, hate response. Everyone knows game going in. electoral college positives negatives. Popular vote positives negatives.

The issue see D's put candidate unlikable many, people either voted Trump 3rd party say, ""fuck system."" Teenagers take kinds risks, much often mothers would like.  

Some adults still teenagers, emotionally and/or intellectually.  funny PROMISED call me! one wearing mask photo statue. Ironic. New death cases continue decline here. Hospitalizations stable. 

People getting freaked number positives there's context affect numbers health even like mask hard wear. fashion statement. wanna asshole it, wear one fucking MAGA it. still bad, least risking people's lives obnoxious sewer rat. can’t use gun you’re dead tho  NY likely starting spike sadly. people starting care far gather real problem system two tier winner takes vote means amplifies two party democracy. One could even construct case third party exists gets fourty percent popular vote(and win popular vote) even appear electoral college thing. means person votes basically three options. Support party A, B let vote go void. Assuming dislike one parties B basically forces vote other. feel like system part blame huge division America two camps. let us travel country. little airborne, irs still good still good! Kinda weird kinda correlates lol May ask where? mix deaths lagging well better treatments SMH I’ve lazy move again. think maybe year time get several people day fighting us masks.

Kudos giving in. It’s natural people resist masks dislike much convince don’t work. ofcourse even simple mask works prevents saliva drops expelled ending someone elses mouth talking.

The blood hands perpetuating asinine claim masks “don’t help”. Fuck them. WEAR MASK! Take L move kid. gets defensive this? He’s trying goad dumb folk wearing one strong. yes. that's said. live North Carolina, got yelled man least 20 years older wearing mask hiking trail. yelled take f**k off. people want wear it, don’t want anyone wear one. that’s case we’re fucked anyway vaccine isn’t going anything us. ""Create account"" wall.

Fuck shit. Next... Hospitals far greater infection controls nursing homes also trained staff. highly suggest volunteer local nursing homes clearly see understaffed undertrained are. governor choose evil cost thousands grandparents lives.  fat rednecks  Same.  many people hated Murphy. I’m happy NJ doing. made (hopefully) Careful sub hard gov cuemo whatever reason. Headlines need date day (Thurs, Fri, ...)

I know repeat yesterday's story yet new horror... Deaths way NYC North East. going south west. balances out. soon spikes show numbers. Yeah like worth even paid money? pay go cruise horror stories people forced weeks end tiny windowless cabins unable go outside leave ship, knowing going get Covid-19. That's people bragging refusing vaccine even laughably, worrying forced get vaccine ridiculous. Like, lol - going readily available worry. Belgium population 11 million, Brazil 210 million.

And unfortunately lot people Brazil packed cities, Sao Paola alone 12 million people. Stay strong! country's population truly beyond anything imagine. really hope disaster there. I'm Brazilian we're together, hopefully someday I'll able visit India, life-changing trip. hope decides look ""strong"" wear mask.  from? US that's sure.

I ask certain powers world *want* us give up. WAY early that, months! would ever consider giving fighting American lives? cowardly. 

Look New York. New Jersey. Look Chicago. Look SF. saved thousands.

We ""give up."" ever. wont even consider making masks mandatory. got 1031 cases today 16.1% positive percentage... May highest number cases day 250. fucking idiot Yeah get that, store made requirement wear mask. *had* masks initially get in, left around necks got inside, spoke up. wouldn’t left home knew people going casually take inside. - personally account people’s understanding, least area cases low. It’s interesting temp checks, hand sanitizer making wear masks.  link worked me, original. Looks like ""soft paywall"". throw link archive.is work everyone. talking viral reactivation relevant.... I'm immunologist lol albeit virologist Mindtricks first There’s many ways spin deaths start rolling in. LET BODIES HIT FLOOR  I'm actually probably gonna keep wearing one over, used get funny people coughing sneezing around wearing gloves sucks masks fine, infact get call lady way often nice Yeah said going review quarterly make changes needed. way change things America aiming profitability. individual doesn’t save money immediately installing solar panels roof wind turbine yard, it’s going happen. prices keep dropping green technologies, people move towards them. Nothing saving planet, everything saving money. Don’t fight current. Use advantage. Sadly I'm sure general public going learn this. government private businesses might better prepared pandemic taught anything fellow americans willing anything meet crisis, provided requires absolutely zero sacrifice discomfort part. understand however greatly affected country live. I've shared times recently actually little worried wearing mask public. made fun thought less of, potential physical confrontations. president's recent statements, I'm sure going improve. alarming amount people I've encountered still certain plot turn country communism. can't psychopaths get infected already.. So, mean states allow carry firearms public violating Second Amendment?  New York cases peaked time generally deaths - why? Herd* anyone else says it. spelled thing yesterday. contrary... Maybe different country, they're told chill home unless gets bad. definitely significant population receives treatment beyond rest, sleep, eat well stay hydrated. think doctors learning effective ways help people dire situations. also think lot really really vulnerable citizen already died, sadly, makes sense death rate slow down. states realize can't bullshit way though? Lying numbers fix problem. target Best Buy.  Probably shouldn’t respiratory pandemic, no? Wtf happening Brazil yeah gotta take wins shitty shitty shitty shitty times. Gucci making masks, masks hit bunch major fashion magazines. They're considered statement high fashion point.

The craft stores marketing fashion trend even mandated anywhere. many emails... everywhere... think anxiety leads poor choices impact society large? suspect temperature would different life earth.  Honestly looks like Fed Gov’t went version Redeker Plan World War Z. Accept you’re deep shit can’t save everyone knowingly sacrifice people effort save even people. surgeon general’s advice probably resulted hospitals enough PPE overrun. 

The real question hell hospitals position drastic plan necessary. left positivity rate virus last long enough - even optimal conditions - make packing plant salad bowl.

i've seen numbers long virus lives paper, steel, plastic, numbers long survives fruits veg?   almost like open up, takes small fraction people infected relatively quickly spread virus. Sadly, doubt see last states problem ""It's flattening"", open up, ""It's anymore, why?"".

I hope not, I'm seeing hard pattern people assuming numbers stagnating completely unimaginable rise again. relax rules guidelines, everyone rushes return normalcy once, imagine, quick way spread virus.

Like said, hope going happen more, see reason to. Sure, states *might* better, again, mean can't get worse road. takes small fraction people start spreading virus, time actually notice hard numbers coming back, going much states respond hard measures rapidly, we've seen many many times.   significant it? know past two years, sunspots present sun 78% 77% time. Historical highs since recorded. seems quite lately Yes. handled absolutely awfully state level. someone tries use NY model handle coronavirus applauding low positivity rate today, literally sit back laugh. younger people drive fuck outta office. don’t understand many people don’t believe say COVID rates likely significantly underestimated. VERRRY strong incentive minimize numbers every single person involved point care POTUS. Dr. Fauci [recently one reasons recommend masks general public PPE could reserved healthcare workers given is/was global also acknowledged masks initially recommended general public first responders wouldn’t feel strain shortage PPE.*  explained public health experts ""were concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply.”* 

&amp;#x200B;

The Surgeon General, WHO, CDC similar stance, foreign governments Austria Malaysia.

The Surgeon General also acknowledged recommending masks were, part, due trying PPE hoarding.

&amp;#x200B;

It fair give public health experts leeway is/was brand new virus, know effective masks are, also understandable people angry told PPE issue beginning wear cloth masks better nothing. say that? scary thing Brazil's numbers testing done - 11,000 PER million. Populaton 210,000,000 . 2 million tests 1 million cases.

A week ago 4k tests per million 800,000k infected 1,000,000 tested. 

Their real number probably something north 10,000,000. never stated things. stated flattening curve intended for. Oh, happening already Well, cases conscious. Plenty people conscious ventilators.

&amp;#x200B;

Christ almighty, know it...please, hope god survives this. sinking feeling probably won't. RIP Brazil live baffling well. guess might due people spending time outdoors around density Nashville Memphis have. Though weird Chattanooga exploded last weeks increase Knoxville mostly linear. Providing location help!  zombies start.... Probably next week it'll back 1000 day. know, 747 people died yesterday, 809 day that..it's still shitshow far I'm concerned. awhile... 

When check updates, seems silly worried couple thousands cases every day, moment get 140k+ cases day...

By way, wedding got stuck Philippines 3 months returned Europe now. OP sure intentionally getting respiratory virus destroy lungs smart idea athletes(or anyone). last two sentences mean? wouldn’t bad news social groups 50+? ""cancelled"" Agreed... He's may anything listed shirt he's c*nt... heard brain. I'm defending America's broken system way, $1.1M pretty misleading real.

Insurance companies hospitals America play really silly pointless game marking costs huge amount giving discount pretending great deal.

Let's talk simple task costs $1000. hospital wants charge $1200 recoup costs make little profit. 

But insurance company comes says ""we send patients hospital, gotta give us big 50% discount we'll send somewhere else"". 

So what's hospital going do? can't accept $600 insurance company they'll lose money go business. solution mark cost task $2400 tell insurance company ""sure we'll give 50% discount"" insurance company happy they're getting ""deal"" hospital happy they're getting money need stay business.

Repeat process hundred times got insane fictional prices mean anything insurance companies ever paying tiny fraction ""original price"". go hospital America tell insurance usually able give far smaller bill that's close insurance company actually pays. Low hanging fruit Karma worked. Nice job. Florida doesn’t high % excess deaths compared states. Deaths recorded COVID-19 pneumonia too. I’ve friends call coronavirus hoax day protests started zero deaths virus New York. 

Yeah, keep saying loved one gets infected point almost dying tell it’s real not. 

Also, we’re country Americans think Bigfoot real earth flat. Nothing come shocker  think theyve already passed US. still severely limited testing government plan increase ...this ~~getting~~ really bad. probably already has. isn’t far behind. i'm ignoring shit. shut debate, scientific consensus humans significant impact rate climate change. deniers usually benefit financially politically, joke. fun Ok Karen week, cities Arizona prevented instituting pro-mask policies governor's order. fake news, lockdowns measures taken worked *until* abandoned. We're upswing (even hard hit areas like NYC longer *as* active) deaths climb eventuality hits. can't remember said it, believe upper level CDC representative, statement effect ""a successful lockdown make seem like entire course action unecessary."" Evidence scant (everyone wearing mask pandemic) something that's robust studies done.

No one saying mask usage everyone guarantee transmissions occurring. wearing mask perfect solution terrible logic. guy Twitter attention whore. mean he's even pageant wave. statement City New Orleans, cluster new COVID-19 cases appears emerged large high school graduation party large gathering outside bar. bar located outside New Orleans, according city.

Source? government sending us die majority people willingly abiding. end result pandemic catastrophic feel helpless watching slowly burn. anime fanboys Cool, thanks.

Interesting see low increase hospitalizations Georgia is. Feel like things really opened here. Take care dear ones, strong! Hugs loves Argentina! 

I hope mother recovers family end safe healthy :). get this!!! Thats way playing start. boomers charge scared fucking death put misleading headlines studies make look like younger people need worry this, really don't.  Definitely wild witness wear mask water park? Answer honestly. That's reaction probably expected. think people feel like that's far popular opinion actually is. one group vocal mean majority. like far ahead America.

The US may OFFICIAL cases done 22 million tests total record 2 million cases. Brazil hand done 2.5 million tests already 1 million cases. probably far cases. Testing severely limited best Brazil tests ICU patients.

In fact study University Sao Paulo says Brazil may many 15 times number cases reported (so 15 million cases) “A recent study showed filtration shy N95s could achieved combinations cotton common fabrics like silk, flannel, chiffon.”

Bandanas offer really bad protection: Many states reporting that.

Try covid exit strategy though Prolly cause get elected basis they're good ""crisis management"".. they're particularly smart individuals.  sound like member CCP sad considered “good”, it’s oblivious done much earlier No. stuck ""responsible society"" philosophy  thought point article amount hospitals charge health provider?
Your health care messed everything artificially inflated insurance pay. 
I dont know sure, would say Australia UK costs would half lot less? virus becoming less deadly isn’t really talked about. Maybe there’s science behind I’ve hoping outcome since day one. like lived city 10000 people 5 people died, 4 75.

Its catastrophe.  seemed pro virus

Giving link ADHS data suggest all. Masks needed... masks needed

Virus getting less potent... virus becoming potent

Make fucking minds admitted intentionally lying masks

Huh? article titled ""media silent"" oxymoron eaten lotsa-morons blame game another week most. cases near 10k daily state weeks need actual response outbreak dumb words. I'm boat, want see GF (which since Feb) need take 1h flight. I'm going masked, goggled gloved fuck anyone wearing mask around me. 

Good idea picking seat far toilet. virus seems control there. Similar story emerging many countries things seem taking turn worse USA last days . Meanwhile Europe people basically think whole thing agitating everything ""go back normal"". DFW also bigger states.  Either way, thing control there's little hope containing it. personally know several anti-mask people think wearing attack existence human being. We're fucked. think saw 3k claim Drudge. Yeah, drudge often sensational headline never corrects confirms  Apparently silent since we've posts Hospitalizations reported everything longer tweet. news good. voters might seen theatre drink communion cup

this terrible idea even absent covid. intinction way. Genuine question, else would go?

Hospitals need space patients sick enough need inpatient level care, nursing home residents nursing homes family unable care them. can’t put nursing home residents hotels unable care themselves. planning leaving doors windows open get much natural circulation going possible. yep. time go get haircut! It’s design point. Running away using less lethal weapon still justified shooting, running away armed robbery gun pants still lawful shooting.. there’s plenty lawful acts unlawful acts ones condoning injustice you’re idiot today ""Shit can't make doubt happened"" uh, realize death worry? mention, read rising rate even healthy kids problems. many kids, many ""hyper fit"" players willing risk? Got number? many ending permanent lung damage, neurological, knows issues, worth you? What's price someone's future? already see people taking soon lights dim. fights. Lol don’t even compare 2 big shitshows led selfish morons  seemed pro virus attitude hard follow. People seem upset good news happens drive negatives. Arizona better last two weeks. good news. perfect no! clear saying always focusing negative terrible way live. 

If feel prick apologize them. intention. Political cults status quo now. Foreign adversary disinformation efforts divide sow discord essentially won. way *actually* make America great unity. Or, least, stopping ugly trend demonizing discrediting anyone disagrees political cult leader day. admit news fake? read study, 14 day wait mask set aside virus die. give you, right 14 day wait part... ;) described people exaggerating... propaganda... I've gotten much anxiety dumb fucks treating COVID joke lockdown honest. came comment exact thing. Currently Arizona starting turn real sh** show. Testing difficult find, reference CVS backed tests next Saturday throughout metro Phoenix. Testing lagging processing times taking longer longer. numbers see probably week behind. dad urgent care getting tested yesterday place accepting walk ins facetimed line wrapped around entire shopping plaza. It’s bad lot people still taking seriously, sad. Remember CDC never fucking said that? Listen yourself, 121,000 Americans died trying take sort sick victory lap one single day 900+. Holy fuck... 50k new cases one day?! Florida world hurt reach tipping point hospitals overloaded.

This said every state since beginning pandemic. Even 1k death per day , still looking 170k death October possible depending bad gets next couple months. go virus go! dont ever wanna leave mommy's basement! agree masks cannot relied means protection. mean they're useless worn. CDC W.H.O. recommend use mask along social distancing hygiene, especially cases social distancing available. I'd hope everyone agree recommendations. referring links give impression everyone wear mask useless. 

Also, burden proof you. CDC W.H.O. clearly recommend face coverings along measures doubters prove wrong. need year lockdown. Intense, nationwide lockdowns solved problem within months China, New Zealand, Vietnam, Italy, Spain, etc. 

Look Denmark. They're perfectly fine masks all. Why? got rid root cause. mention supporting employees help make everything happen, logistics, travel, they're certainly risk, maybe much, risk still there. think places make port calls letting them. Little island nations Caribbean Alaskan coastal towns much far medical resources go. doubt they'll letting cruise ship make port call anytime soon. one wants deal community spread ship thousands people quarantined port. worries, I’m venting point. Sorry situation, makes feel better stranger internet sending positive vibes :) never said that. listens film critics anyways? Comparing animal studies human studies thing human studies. antibodies mean body *fought* COVID, mean knows defeat it. mention people test positive once.

Still early certain immunity It’s definitely increasing here. Lee County, Known positives &amp; Hospitalizations up. don’t know Collier County’s numbers inland farming communities getting hit HARD. several stories sub it. Missouri - maybe 15% people see wearing masks. guarantee lone upvote person commented to. Likley number shut everyone went life like normal. Hence, advance screenings press critics  people getting two week lag? Average incubation time five days tests usually take 48 hours, I’d imagine there’s week lag. still makes 109,000 cases three days. alternating showings movies masks without masks? 1:00pm - mask required, 4:00pm - mask required, etc... 

I imagine also cleaning sanitary guidelines required showings?  Belgium already 277,567 deaths adjusted size US.

The UK already 209,087 deaths adjusted size US.

Sweden already 162,110 deaths adjusted size US. Permanent years. one percent three percent? That's still high-risk group. comment makes feel seen. last movie saw theaters 1917, think would last foreseeable future. 

While miss magic going movies, hope wait theaters still afterwards. Key word: ""want"" dont serious. can’t catch COVID large crowds?

This good news. Time open things ASAP. Okay... let’s say Covid19 like 40x September 11th since affected America 110000 dead ww1 ? Pretty much, they're probably already overrun. answering experience with.

At point I'm betting -are- good answers people COVID recover, flattening curve important, many people opting sick home. One insane parts virus there's many people really, seriously sick, once. hate isolated home shut down, they’ll really hate isolated hospital. behalf incredibly stupid Americans apologize. many people don’t seem care others (even Covid Americans never really cared others, sorta got implemented way people view Covid) 

It baffles many people don’t care. want playoff infected. 

If infected play  Active cases, new cases? Because, ya know, article new cases.  That's little 1000 deaths day. 704 deaths today. stayed right we'd ~15k deaths. virus accelerating though. So, although might 25k deaths, might thousand. 

I think panic porn much maybe slightly high estimate. honestly, might wrong either. certainly absurd guess. Fox ""news"" also large contributor something like minor issue know it’s awesome .. something never seen don’t know .. could tough diagnose. like giant hotel party everyone really nice, there's food everywhere , wake new place every days every day . love trapped middle ocean cell reception, escape. Fuck let add context happened underreporting issue last two days São Paulo state ""e-SUS"" system could update number serious ICU cases. Today corrected 19k overall cases last three days entering system.

Oh god I’m sorry you’re hot spot, please stay safe keep good work! aside. Austin, Texas right now, soonest schedule free test 7 days now, turnaround time tests ~4 days. I'm sure are, unless willing get stuck $200+ doctors exam bill possible get test result within 48 hours am. Well, know, nothing black white. Corona win situation. end day Sweden lock mean social distancing. matter whether world lock shit screwed inevitable outcome clear national strategy contain virus ever implemented. irresponsible states eventually cause hot spots states successfully lowered death rates new cases significantly around around go. Hundreds thousands lives lost, many needlessly. vaccine come new year US may recover decades. world laughing US, anything new recent years. Excellent. Please, usher savior human race rescue us mistake humanity. I'm pretty sure June 1, mean, everything else went back business usual? done, right? We're bored.

Sweden already 162,110 deaths adjusted size US. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* 175,000 new cases today, 55,000 Brazil. Must white houses new talking point. Except fact couple months old long term data. reports lung damage asymptomatic cases. New Zealand article today Chinese study antibodies actually increased risk death second infection. Saying nearly 0 risk wishful thinking, nothing more. ""doom er"" scenarios? Yes, can't disproven data far, avoiding infection smart move People incredibly dumb, panicky animals. many times must large scale issue, due decent percentage people arrogant, willfully ignorant, irresponsibly negligent?

It'd nice precuations made assumption people would able right thing unless thier hands held entire process, despite lot simply choice personal responsibility. ""gubmint"" tell wear mask mean can't wear one. stores let ton people mean can't choose time/day less people there, wait bit clear more.

Simply put, virus spreads us, reason. People large scale simply cannot handle responsible thinking others enough make small personal sacrifices required stop virus spreading everywhere. Ohio Please, honest guys. want American public die pandemic. win-win! 

Think it: Less idiots gene pool, less conservatives, less people deal with, less ""ACTIVISTS"" trying burn USA one city time, less white people. live Nashville days swear wanna go back rural area little supermarket street good enough internet. am. Working plant coworkers getting sick. Still low, stopped masks. hear that. moon landing filmed California, space suit couldn’t fit door lander man. know mans gspot butt? i've dropping ten pounds year eat always did. Brazil that, still kicking ass transmission occurs via direct (deposited persons) indirect (deposited objects) contact airborne (droplets aerosols) routes

It airborne...via droplets.

You're arguing point ignoring semantics.

The virus, SARS-CoV-2, airborne itself, requires microscopic carrier droplets, known aerosols, become airborne. British crazy amount people treat slightly lifted lockdown back normal Sadly, they're stupid enough point things like proof overreacted. Nice catch. saw posted sub right around time made post, wanted make sure saw it. remember mid April marches “for freedom” bunch incels stormed Michigan capitol building guns protest stay home orders...and look stay home orders got them. work disinfecting disinfected airbnb house twice already, think fine! states control, states could end success  Like anything anomalies. stories 20 something year olds sad are- rare. news media don’t care highlight anomalies makes appear common actually are.

Blood type plays role, viral load, wether immune system currently fighting something else hadn’t make sick yet etc.. said wanted family point life... makes self absorbed dipshit, yeah guess am.

I believe stay PhD biochem friends work genetics diseases saying. see shying away admitting know shit certain virus. no, literally. look death rates. wants bet reason could be? still get go there. Tax bennies lots problems. Health, humidity, gators, crazy people. Yeah, 80's. real people lotta doughnuts.

That's coming back, ever, FX departments probably cheaper. Sorry saw groups people top NYC, many without masks, despite media/Redditors saying (though many masks on) social distancing. disease fizzling here. disease care political party doubt Trump's thing worse too, pretty sure it’s scientifically impossible, let’s get testing study linked:   elucidated transmission pathways coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) analyzing trend mitigation measures three epicenters. results show airborne transmission route highly virulent dominant spread COVID-19.  
...  experimental observational studies interhuman transmission indicated significant role aerosols transmission many respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (8⇓⇓–11). example, airborne coronavirus MERS-CoV exhibited strong capability surviving, 64% microorganisms remaining infectious 60 min atomization 25 °C 79% relative humidity (RH) (9). hand, rapid virus decay occurred, 5% survival 60-min procedure 38 °C 24% RH, indicative inactivation. Recent experimental studies examined stability SARS-CoV-2, showing virus remains infectious aerosols hours (12)

but is?? put life hold forever.

If dead, life kinda hold... forever. work Army base. wear mask every building. one even talks it. it. I'm sick last person want infect platoon 18 year old kids miles home first time. Paging u/DrRobRedfield... Natural selection 🙃  awaiting test results I’m pretty sure it. really need essentials medicines. responsible way go this? ok go long mask? Next welding doors shut... hear ya. work healthcare, I’m right you. new treatments many need live without vaccine ? No, it’s didn’t include first part like suggested. Thanks tip. I’ll fix 👍🏻 m-makes so... \*sniff\* *sad*... w-why c-can't people n-*nice* him? \*sob\* honestly military saying helmets optional combat. Phillies ruined many summer me. they're going ruin one everyone else, too! don’t know US UK Germany EU countries roughly 50% reported cases based symptoms according office national statistics. Stop moving goalposts.

If masks limits transmission droplets, Limit transmission disease. way couldn’t.

You’re science denier different creationist. Back normal Vietnam. It'll taken seriously used leverage postpone elections November, fear. colors reflect overall picture multiple factors. Maine still borderline infection rate (R) 0.96 (which good 1, needs bit lower ""green""), additionally, contact traced 22% cases bode well ability contain new clusters. 
That said, 4 counties reported Maine model, know accuracy Yeah, thinking probably got trespassing telling leave. 'event area' campaign tell anyone leave, long race, religion, etc., etc. leave, trespassing subject arrest.

I wonder areas protesters allowed protest in. saying ticket might've inside sort 'event area'. Guess coulda spring break all. someone next literally shitting pants, spitting, throwing everywhere, would absolutely responsibility anything long get destination

Already air? No. don't. mitigate emergency landing, trying clean up, etc no. Would ""fault"" chose fly?

It's nobody's fault scenario. responsibilities fuck we'll wing it.

Unless airline c-suite put gun head made fly, one you. scared, get refund stop complaining. well, number burned destroyed buildings would indicate significant number less peaceful protests initial trigger teargas. really worth destroying people’s livelihoods whole 38 people per million? Epidemiologists study rallys years rest planet laughing asses USA extreme confidence USA puts masks. Masks bit list things scientifically proven effective, still Americans talk masks.
And laugh even harder Americans found masks effective believed. 

But thanks entertainment. need good laugh while. hope French kissed least 6 Trump staff. No. Padres fantastic! remembered season playing we'll since 98 devastating. hate thinking this, but: isn’t large outbreak occurs this, fuel argument “flu” “hoax”. One thing that's really surprised me: moved WeHo Valencia April. general preconceived ideas expect people area, feel like everybody Valencia wearing masks whenever run office back WeHo much. state primary yet? Harvard back day different Harvard today. saying easy get back didn’t tiny acceptance rates like recently. Sadly think going past tense. Less 40% people wearing masks stores beyond frustrating. Man Chubbys, many firsts place can’t even count. remember time cousin gave clap, time got herp momma.. don’t wanna get COVID though. I’ll go warn niece think she’s workin tonight. know say say Wisconsin it’s Alabama north. Anyway Steven Avery innocent birds aren’t real! sort copypasta fits here: American ignoring science facts?

Because trained so. Foreign Intelligence service, traitors useful idiots established last 40 years.

""As mentioned before, exposure true information matter anymore. person demoralised unable assess true information. facts tell nothing, even shower information, authentic proof, documents pictures. ...he refuse believe it...

Easy! New York absolutely fucking shit outta curve. Everywhere go redneck upstate ny people still wearing masks Crude mortality rate really applicable ongoing epidemic. 

Not itself. give true picture spread disease within nation, example.

However, comparing crude CFR's across nations highlight nations performing better comes identifying cases.

The Swedish government said antibody testing results estimated number infections exceeds 600,000. means Swedish government identified less 1 10 cases period infectious. big part reason high number 9% talking calculated current numbers infected dead people Covid.

No shit... that's CFR is, proper numbers current ramped testing Sweden - know crude real CFR. 

False. simply idea talking about.

We actual CFR right front us. case fatality ratio, CFR number reported cases resulted deaths.

We know many cases reported, know many people died. Therefore know ""real"" CFR.

You keep confusing case fatality ratio infection fatality ratio. two different measurements. One looks number identified cases, also includes unidentified cases.

But wrong IFR too. Swedish government given us estimate true number cases - 606,000 - based antibody testing. means calculate IFR stands now... Sweden's IFR falls within range estimated numerous studies - till one highest world.

In fact, using IFR Sweden, Sweden moves *up* rankings, 15 nations higher. Miss everything tbh know risk people never left home wouldn’t get it? everyone else’s problem protect them. Nooooooo waaay! sweating 90 degree heat. Yeah. Im sweaty time. sleep sweating gotten really bad too. twitching night.

Apparently we're bad guys going. know. I'm going judge someone behaviors immediately accidentally killing family member. probably reeling pretty hard someone blame. suspect went something like, see core powering, unplugged it, ventilator kept working battery, assumed well.The hospital idiot proof situation. sub suddenly went tracking daily deaths (which steadily decreased) didn’t fit narrative, moved cases based symptoms confirmed tests. 

Once figure goes wonder they’ll focus next.. want it, too. TLDR: care fellow man massive labor surplus actually helps workers... I'm going say take longer bet increase testing fast enough catch I'll say hit 10000 it'll 35 days

!remindme three weeks NY considered restriction Florida, already happening. Yes, asking latter. I'm Pacific northwest wondering that's drink specific region. Lol Raising cases bust. Yeah it’s real big fuckin mystery.... whenever someone something like two things, first block moderators, block active posters, usually prevent thing trying make happen happening.

I’ve adversarial engagement much longer I’m much better  wearing masks,

Yeah that's 100% accurate. commenting come back two weeks check Yes everyone reddit years. didn’t address point. Great way show you’re wrong. Looks like study event years come. feel bad workers there. also correct, one right tell wear mask.

 currently laws books compel anyone wear anything wish to, unconstitutional. constitution protect required wear anything wish public, covered freedom expression language contained 1st amendment. 

You however free stay inside cover bubble wrap. right, right tell do.

And lastly, one deciding anything. Unless know virus know contagious know exact transmission method... deciding whether someone catches Covid, whether infection asymptomatic, mild, severe whether die it. nature can't end life know strip something barely recognizable disease ifr .26 falling. really credit letting anybody anything half summer? take great leader did..  Appreciate it.

It looks excess deaths (at least time article) leads possibility undercounting 50% max 180k instead 120k, 300k unless something radically changed Looked could find it. amend post prevent misleading anyone. Thanks correction. Thanks info. Appreciate it.

i think ever majority opinion. u/summariser_bot need discuss plans tackle problems come, reasons stated. i'm arguing different; i'm assuming are. argument stands assumption, i'm trying list ways differences different effects ""end user"" depending nature.

in example, matter. broker incompetent able prove claims calculated action motive, name one thing. mom Traverse City thinks virus completely gone normal life resumes. Traverse City... million people visit every summer. Dense hi-rise building dense city. masses walking parks. Yes, suburbs it’s difficult find anyone one. Latin Anerica going mess. Thanks patience taking time put together, swear search...

At glance lot research suggestive far conclusive. Hamsters cages masks fitted scientists necessarily translate use masks general public. meta-analysis looks interesting. also recent though, making point Fauci speaking scientific consensus (or lack one). 

There's read though. Thanks again. According Gov spikes cases related darn pesky Hispanics /s That's moral argument, scientific one. evidence wearing mask even necessary outdoors. 

How protestors wearing masks never spread it? science woke?  3 week old received many necessary vaccines yet, pretty vulnerable. people won’t wear masks, 🤷‍♂️ grandparents. :( fiance grandmother left talk anymore. ain’t worried. god wants die, I’ll die. Replace ""strangers"" ""people cohabitate with"" funniest obese Americans wear mask claim ""being healthy"" 😂

But good thing closed schools. Everybody knows stop spread virus, least stopped school shootings 😉 I'm suppose go Lawton end July ceremony, thinking may skip based numbers far. Figured flying silly going drive, whole trip seems silly. works all. People aren’t able self isolate 100% don’t relatives people help them. desire “live life” nowhere significant lives others We're halfway year we're already near top end swine flu numbers, that's basically entire world locking down.

So ever think arguments all, spew moment come mind? Maybe one red zones spreading. would partially explain seemingly null effect protests aren’t using bathrooms. 🤷🏼‍♀️ knows actually. That's nitric oxide (NO) nitrous oxide (N2O). one way cells communicate within body involved erections, among things. I'm suppose go Lawton end July ceremony, thinking may skip based numbers far. Figured flying silly going drive, whole trip seems silly. There's already Phoenix, Arizona rally scheduled Tuesday, going held megachurch seats 20,000+ inside.

There's also rally planned Mobile, Alabama next month outdoor stadium scheduled yet. agree guy said, cuz much disagree politics people attending rally still people don’t want suffer die, I’ve noticed people protest really seem board wearing masks rally goers don’t. One group trying protect others, not. Ummmmmm... lefty's dont want work dude, want stay home . want keep country closed part. think confused. There's way many roads make plan work Africa posts underrepresented sub. South Africa seems like one next big Hotspots. Entitled life. freedom ends mine starts. outlawing, supposed proper regulation. Scientists would like supplements standards closer food pharmaceuticals. knowing supplement safe bottle says. Meh. People completely ignoring social distancing now. prepared second wave. industry many case meat industry compared size? Germany US, meat industry hotbed corona cases. So, yes, think specific problem. workplace repeatedly shown high-risk COVID-19 infections nothing protect employees. hope wrong, suspect prescient. state New York prosecute there's damn thing Biden it. Seems Casino owners willing roll dice risk. Lockdown get vaccine though? purpose everyone lifted lockdowns.

The countries done well locked long enough get handle slowly reopened using things like contact tracing masks stays manageable low levels. #misuseofthewordliterally Well maybe staying home then. could last rest life.... think thought all.

Enemes states fine trashing states .

Athoritarans natnalists know leeway power instead someone else.

And allies that.

So exactly even talking about? I'm gonna block like arguing trolls online...have great day! go something similar EBV. diagnosed reactivated 6 years ago. blood results still look same. difficult deal days. many people realize could long term effects. doctors figure help either. gave things treat symptoms. don’t money given up? California go outside 99% people wear masks. Clearly one given up. every individual make individual choice. argument works consequences affect you. cases like epidemic pandemic, individual actions directly affect lives others. Intelligent? dunno maybe people date get know get tested sex? know sounds really subversive used get tested new partner, got tested too. add Covid test put person bubble risk.

If want sex strangers, untested people know well, always crap shoot. Covid one many risks. buy weed person instead shop lol shits legal gives shit. bad also impacts people nothing this. Anyone needs get best available treatment. DC suburbs (Maryland), even lot solo drivers see wearing masks. Went drive rural Virginia weekend, greeted one town drove pack least 350 maskless residents - high school graduation city square. correct. There’s vaccine flu Florida resident here. did, seemed like lot people deemed essential. numbers pretty flat little bit, too. 

We opened back May 18th. June first something like 610 Covid cases reported today reported 4,000. 

In unrelated story, I've one work wearing mask week. turned white house federal correctional facility complete three miles fencing prison guards. rehoboth exclusively gay beach....but definitely popular one. looked article, talking northern part LP, I'll vote now. Famously strict. need skills get in. There's one Arizona, another hot spot, Tuesday. I'm sure inside outside. nothing sacred Nice - okay long cook get takeout. place Leelanau great weekend contact-free except family. Pretty much everywhere curbside. stay away tc Lol, yeah posted last night falling asleep really think examples. Lol leaving it. read article? nothing businesses shutting down, still happened. Japan culture actually values employees profits. Also little rusty parent stuff you’re right! need many shots spending time around large amounts people. put phone airplane mode paywall pops view article free depends grocery store I'm in. Walmart easily probably obviously worst, Costco best since heavily enforce policy. stores shop Kroger Meijer various degrees those. fact wearing mask become political issue drives mad TSA freaked pat accidentally forgot take bag M&amp;Ms bag once. 

“WHAT THIS? WHAT’S BAG”

It literally lunch baggie M&amp;M packs it. Wow, look people serious risk category CCOVID-19 doubling rate obviously going decline cases rise everyday.

Yes, decrease significant nearing herd immunity levels infected recovered died. Neither happened India time. Even now, biggest hotspot cities less 0.5% population confirmed infected (actual numbers probably 10 times that) nowhere near herd immunity levels, latter scenario happens slow spread enough, recoveries deaths catch new infections. Also, true doubling rate reducing numbers increasing, would still reducing now, lockdown lifted, isn't. That's means exponential, doubling rate remains constant regardless number. Trump going live long. think NJ benefits lumped together rest US. NJ can't really stand microscope.
-A New Yorker Apparently 6 members Trumps Advance Staff already tested positive there. Got link 17 year old? libertarian answer. again. weeping wailing gnashing teeth ought start taking seriously

From rally participants? Doubt it. Deflection knows limits. Exactly point Yeah sure. comparison aids apply. wear condom sex even seropositive, inforned, etc.

Also people continue sex. 32 million person died Aids total.

Covid spread breathing. Hard make love without breathing think.

So yeah life must resume depending spike country, state city etc, may refrain while.

If tests become widely available may test persons engaging close contact. 100% safe vetter hoping best. I’ve never fully recovered PE either. want like before, it’s frustrating. Hang there. okay, guys, remember doomers morons blowing proportions fake news saw TV. know smart rational thinker. freedumbs venue holds 19,000... Weve really given point individual much want risk senior week awesome.

everyone gets beach houses spends week together friends parties non stop.

its event hear high school...i see people would feel pressure miss out. especially 17-18 year olds. Add sir, nice. Lol... underrated comment. age well leaders stupid shit dont judge population accordingly. Um, hasnt bright past either, right? really crazy following going states compared going Canada. province; Ontario, best job; 180 cases today, see happening south, really insane. Toronto, largest city, around 60 cases today, opened bars, restaurants yet, much better shape places Arizona, Texas, Florida. live hour west Toronto, we, like rest province opened bars restaurants, allowed patio service. 

fwiw, people safer outdoors without mask indoors without mask.  No. Microwaves produce heat. “microwaves” flooding interior radio waves interact water molecules. interaction vibrates water molecules movement generates heat cooks food. understanding that, see mask doesn’t work. It’s fabric. water. don’t get wet. 

Believe me, read Stanford tests one based that, ideas shot down. 

Industrial ovens: produce exact constant temp produce consistency around entire interior. aren’t hot spots. 

So 158. 300. 158 PLUS 30 mins get temp high enough kill virus enough break n95 mask materials. consistent. 

So another option. UV light. works unlike heated sir box, UV light projected source. need get surfaces. literally bathed light. UV, minimum strength wavelength work still get surfaces. mask facing light isnt. issues light penetrating way thru. 

Then steam method. Sure. done. again. Requires proper steaming method equipment. 

Plus. Here’s kicker. gonna want decontaminate mask let’s assume it’s there, absolute last thing gonna wanna take mask drag inside kitchen possibly get virus everywhere. reasons throw masks becIse assumption mask job surface gotta get rid it. There’s even crazy process remove masks theory it’s biohazard. 

Most people pull whatever. remove mine carefully gloves paper sack sack closed it’s left outside days. never goes house don’t touch til time gone by. 

Am insane. bit. I’m operating assumption mask job don’t endless supply n95s. enough rotate. 

And also, get used. 

So bottom line decon methods aren’t even feasible average person even think got process working, you? Time one thing works absence friends labs bunch equipment. you’re willing go work dressed Goofy pandemic, even go work dressed Goofy can’t find better job, probably don’t choice go back work.

📷 fair enough, hard blame people trying meal likely think helping support restaurant.

It's fault policy makers enforcers. sounds like politicians anyone position power. guys think allowed even see friends (in safe manner). parents kept house since spring break. I’m allowed walk neighborhood bc one wears mask. I’m allowed go grocery runs bc guess shouldn’t risk parents can. I’m ever allowed outside mow lawn. try stay active house exercising ever gets certain level fulfillment life. play video games times online classes. still feel like I’m going insane. hate living parents, they’re legit keeping I’m prisoner. friends dumb going vacations pandemic, also several shut friends. stricter parents even could go outside meet masks. unfair want chill friends safe manner? told would wear mask 100% time, remove touch whatever reason, force friends thing. even won’t budge. American, I’d worry US vaccine well. wouldn’t put past administration ram vaccine hasn’t properly tested proven work. see little talk bad disease be, even send patient hospital. think Fauci said week believes 20-40% people mild symptoms. even tiny percentage 60-80% people (you know, majority) end hospital, that's lot weeks struggling breath. Yeah, would never want spread parents older family members, even purely selfish point view sounds horrible. acting like either disease either kills even notice it? feel like Trump knows he’s done year he’s trying screw country much possible leaves office. married Wife 1995. died last December extremely ill nearly 20 years. took care nearly marriage. 

I used think like hope going die first, even though illness knew would pan like that. 

But happened way glad died first - would want experience this. knew would bad - idea would bad. 

Very pleased still. know know already - make every day count. positivity percentage Brazil absolutely awful well. Obviously American making percentage mean something is, Brazil around 40%...which got really bad sign infections far they're managing find confirm. 15 min famewhore shoes, shirt, mask service It’s parable remember back February one brief moment China cases coming rest world quiet. Nowadays look world case graph barely tell China outbreak straight line. What’s blood type? good analogy... seatbelts save yourself, masks (save) others (if) it. think analogy brightest use pro-mask populace. saying. Everybody clustered inside breathing other. Trump = Colin Robinson. True. India poor country. money buy AC pay electricity bills. neighbor currently party 15+ people 1,000 square foot apartment. definitely needs said. world flat. 

Global warming real. 

Trump cares you. 

Covid overly hyped media. 



Let's face it, America going full stupid.  weight age know many young people scale weight reflect weight population set Literally nothing said said covid patients suffer long term health consequences. said exact thing wrote. may Hope worth idiots “I wish cooler bob would die already.” almost like thing exponential! knew?!  Bless simple mind, I’m sure mean well. 31K new cases reported US today. North Carolina (where Cooper governor) reported state record high 1,700 new cases days ago one wants take seriously. 

If you’re interested daily discussions, stop participating them. us like stay informed. diaper. Yeah use two totally excellent examples countries care citizens! Fuckn got em! man. Dying money getting sick stupid, please stop suggesting that. Al menos en Argentina están yendo bastante bien fueron cuarentena completa desde hace tiempo, lo raro es que suban tantos los casos últimamente, ojalá se conviertan un Chile 2.0 en casos la verdad ignoring every call family, friends, colleagues...I guest home since February. way would 5 guests Victoria secret angels, would still make wear masks time, probably chains safety 25 year old joke. See Seinfeld episode.  Yeah it’s bad. People don’t care. Going drinking brunch important.  uncle lives OC. major tool. calls Newsome “Emperor.” Needless say doesn’t wear mask. I’ve read lot articles lately tell, understand virus much better beginning.

My heart goes anyone caught virus early days. even go back far. major chunk population survives medical conditions half-century ago killed many.

Think many people high blood pressure meds Spanish flu technically floated around 50 years. Eventually, ran steam became common flu strain. happens, happens Lol. even think theyd closed. I'm gonna keep pointing every time. New York's testing roughly 70,000 people every day coming back average 1% tests positive. Florida's testing 30,000 12% tests come back positive. Less half tests yet 1200% positives. aren’t saying that, they’re saying “aren’t concerned someone would this” already know exact market came from, information don’t know specific vendor, level detail seems kinda pointless me. Alex Jones says hospitals patients college party ""Pretty soon, we'll zero""

-President Tweety McTurdpants whole thing massive fucking joke. Everyone know Michigan 24/7 screaming governor this. doesn't. Go back packer country! U.P. ours. lol. You’re haven’t you? 
Where source you’ve never been, lived grown here. 

First off, aware ROI separate country UK? Northern Ireland country UK. ROI course within EU Northern Ireland British country. 

Do really actually think hate lol. Nearly one million ROI citizens live UK nearly 300,000 Brits live within ROI. I’ve never come across one bad scenario entire life Brits Irish people lol. dare visit Ireland tell people like IRA see happens lmao. 
 
Americans can’t understand you’ve never grown lived here, Englishman also family Scotland, Wales Ireland. That’s case millions people countries. End of, idea you’re ‘really’ talking about, doubt you’ve barely met actual Irish British person doubt even you’ve even either country. 

I’m starting massive argument mate, I’ve lived life family affected troubles countries I’m qualified speak this, think say write. It’s fun games America nothing happened ever affected it’s different countries people deal real. Don’t pick sides based see internet TV. 

And serving member British Army actually find quite offensive genuinely think us hate other. 7 Irish Irish tied regiments Army thousands Irish serving British soldiers, numbers Irishmen coming join us WW2 levels nowadays. don’t think that’s quite hate imagined it. 

An Irish friend mine lost legs OP TORAL Afghanistan serving regiment I. Irish citizen serving British flag like thousands do. think he’d agree well? isn’t hate stop trying think is. 

Some things bigger think actually affected people like myself. It’s internet trolling reading Wikipedia pages it’s people friends lives. You’re lucky, you’re American never affected never live don’t take radical ideas even anonymity internet. case ever visit UK Ireland, never says beliefs yours, trust me. This. Seriously.

Vote. Done. Seriously selfish stupid. Here, take rope fucking dare point said anything racist. ok well, proof see states open - done smart still get result, gotta something else. money human nature. Non-fans calling sport ""sports ball""... cringe list lot federal officials. state local officials blame reopening? I've gone elsewhere, correct approach impending emergency tell truth. Say supplies N95 masks limited immediately restricted medical personnel IDs, non-medical staff also wear mask, make one necessary (as 1918). Share patterns. Provide guidance. Make recommendations hoarding (1 per person, etc.). things competent government supposed do. It’s vaccine Well shitty job immediately ton better get paid without actually it. Ha make Hispanic lives matter! Well, Moderna's statements timetable anything like Elon Musk's self driving, trouble. Dr.? Nobody staying anymore.

It's summer, even outdoor concerts yet open people pack Parks flocking droves parks!!! right, equivalent raptured. DJT literally second coming Jesus Christ. people die direct result attending Party Rally going straight Heaven. 'I'm Irish I'm right Irish things' literally identity politics. 

Yeah, say provide proof. think take FACT Irish CDC issued guidelines TTI words internet account hails *Belarus* shining success story, thanks. Agreed. still wear mask anywhere go. laugh want. USA isnt seeing resurge. still first wave forever doesnt say much.Bubonic plague hasnt dissapeared either. didn’t say wasn’t data scientist. I’m saying data scientist different calling poly sci major “scientist”.

As said, degrees nothing science. She’s chick puts data website. special training knowledge. Zinc use zinc 

Emails need answer emails. spent $100 million looking need answer. 

Hilary killed Trumps good friend Jeff. 

Lock up. DOJ left leaning. many neck beards listen too. didn’t realize douchey recently. dammit Mommy’s Daddy’s buy degrees. hope get better, may take awhile think wont. 15 years ago contracyed virus attacked lungs, SARS, lasted 7 months, took year fully recover feel like again. Shouldn’t rioting? dude youre asking people change eat thats hard work - even moreso facemask. seen way people eat around here? 

also - im using facemask, case understood. case levels starts spread pretty rapidly uncontrollable manner. Imagine thinking civilization would even happened humanity didn’t evolve take care others communities rather run around throw things prey.

And imagine thinking systems weren’t built protect certain populations others. Survival fittest people don’t realize sheer amount luck takes combined actions make keeps people alive even really explain it. picked helluva time pro-government. time sure shouldn't. noticed medical people screaming PPE. Seemed pretty obvious masks worked point.  get started that? fulfilling?i think may want try that. always wanted volunteer prisons never could issues immune system lungs. Tuberculosis tragically common us prisons. Living Traverse City amazing see. tell small businesses (most 'big businesses' too) taking seriously since beginning. Perhaps small town charm lack violent crime, general attitude usually pretty compassionate around like think instances like bring folks closer (metaphorically speaking, course).

Now work better workers rights service industry employees AKA work force propping tourism income resort towns. you’re cat Internet don’t medical degree. listen medical degrees 😂. Come problem kept saying Phase 2 going based data science. never laid benchmarks were.

Could worse. turned job offer FL weeks ago staff on-site whole time. FWIW, position company makes non-critical software. negative importance. Wow. Florida Arizona hot spots. That's good given lot people significant risk categories. know stating obvious, lot could avoided decent leadership. without Common Sense We'll live see. count chickens hatch. ""I can't believe everyone exact thing I'm doing"" Oh no, April 2020. Shits long cancelled could be? told website Florida fine everyone else prideful admit wrong Florida showed us could open everything spike Probably masks play role, role big forms hygiene social behaviour. Keeping distance probably non-existing stadium like that. Ventilation might ok. Touching face/... washing hands biggest factor probably.

All together big mistake organizing party, even top scientists make possible speaking it. PACs spend millions mocking political opponents, get invest showing going rallies bad idea. There's enough footage ski resorts happened Bergamo/Lombardia beginning epidemic. Chinese strain good.European-American bad.I cant take seriously anything comes China. low IQ think makes better? fact checkpoint nothing political grandstanding tax payer expense far worse. Would mean still deadly? new developments origin virus? Early Outpatient Treatment Symptomatic, High-Risk Covid-19 Patients Ramped-Up Immediately Key Pandemic Crisis Harvey Risch American Journal Epidemiology, kwaa093, Published: 27 May 2020
Abstract 1.6 million Americans infected SARS-CoV-2 times number carry antibodies it. High-risk patients presenting progressing symptomatic disease hospitalization treatment high mortality. outpatient treatment prevents hospitalization desperately needed. Two candidate medications widely discussed: remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin. Remdesivir shown mild effectiveness hospitalized inpatients, trials registered outpatients. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin widely misrepresented clinical reports public media, outpatient trials results expected September. Early outpatient illness different later hospitalized florid disease treatments differ. Evidence use hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin inpatients, irrelevant concerning efficacy pair early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin used standard-of-care 300,000 older adults multicomorbidities, estimated proportion diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias attributable medications 47/100,000 users, estimated mortality &lt;20%, 9/100,000 users, compared 10,000 Americans dying week. medications need widely available promoted immediately physicians Arizona far worse state currently. Many cities implement mask orders though. Like teeth. Lol, ""not political"" comment replied get removed? yeah, awful someone close gets sick believe it, damage done Ohh really? case numbers low. around Montana state around there? Seriously. Resistance futile point. open everything enforce mandatory masks, widespread testing contact tracing wait vaccine. that, media start focusing things. Two weeks whatever Why’s that? isn’t immediately downvoted? hope people get sick die? Definitely lizardperson, stupidity like 100% human. Yeah think government concerned would end many closed restaurants. Ny record breaking 72k tests 790 new positives like 650. That’s selfish piece shit. maybe people keel die getting positive test result. positive tests lead hospitalizations lead ICU admissions lead deaths. Good Lord.. new normal old normal much higher mortality rate. Well, one group made predominantly white people group fighting civil rights black people. come couple reasons someone might issue second one first. fair think many people concerned getting virus around 50% (which suspect low estimate) never even show symptoms. think many shrugged deadly dangerous old nursing home. long many asymptomatic cases know ever get people take seriously more. Yeah gotta see next weeks turn dumb Crossed fingers. Plus, AC failure would great. wearing masks BLM protests deserve hefty fines police officers right? There's many movies coming either. delayed till next year later. think do. wear mask pisses off. look number people public, got essentials shoppers, essential workers, ""I'm bored"" people shopping that's that's open. number ""I'm bored"" shoppers huge, huge, whopping majority, much bigger two groups combined. going making sure everyone's risk goes action hours multiple days per week, see need protect them. Make vanish, make stay stores except rare, limited time essentials runs, I'd lot less resentful wearing mask. Dumb sign indeed. theres lot stupid here. I’m showing symptoms live boomer parents. Temperature 99.5, deep cough producing mucus, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, diarrhea im getting cold sores like always get sick immune system fucked up. 

It’s obviously mild need treatment don’t want give mom dad. do? Lock room? go ask test? people best could, heavy voter suppression tactics. I'm taking Zoom class professor would like actually see faces. can't it. cover phone's camera. can't video chatting thing. makes anxious. 

I really thought one tbh. Everyone else seems love Zoom. told wife allow business charge fine. Come without mask? Add $20 total, leave, cover up. turn businesses use funds hazard pay employees. Big, strong boys eat spinach like Popeye! Happy cake offered suggestion proportional representation earlier thread, ignored it.

Furthermore, definition “fair” direct democracy. fair means context democratic republic.

Jfc, I’m sorry sound exasperated, I’m tired engaging people argue place ignorance and/or bad faith. largest areas PA yellow phase people using less crowded rural areas example successful reopening whole state creating false sense security. question. difference March? many infections caused far deaths. 

Sorry people downvoting.  Makes sense. think I've super market since March hah really not. part fuck rhe virus fuck testing fuck 1%? Second Amendment Right inalienable, definition inalienable way taken Constitutional Amendment Medical care isn’t surviving though. given palliative care? dying pain fear, helped meds treatments ease passing? don’t care other. did, would willing simple things like wearing masks voluntary social distancing. no, it’s “muh freedoms” fuck people health. People Arizona already blaming Mexico isn’t coming place think “give up.” think tailor approach handling differently. save thousands lockdown it’s seemingly undone mass public gatherings lack masks/distancing. literal president U.S. sees point wearing mask, despite guidance top public health infectious disease experts. president shows total lack leadership handling infectious disease state flavor handle reopenings/whether make masks mandatory, it’s going continuous ebb flow hotspots, case surges, deaths, etc. feels like needs consistent, uniform direction- fifty different states different things literal president insists everyone crowd venue distant future. long continue handling like this, seems like it’s inevitable many become infected. nice CA allows leeway. I'm looking forward weekly filing mess endure. rust belt much fun manufacturing cuts. I've endured several 4 hour phone calls, wait, trying keep unemployment flowing. Congratulations grad student status, enjoy yourself. one enjoyable experiences. Amazon puts OSHA Kenosha make sense new deaths continuing decline FL covid+ rates skyrocket Ive never despised country much life. Ive always felt like belong im starting see why. poor people families to. really breaks fucking heart. mention yet already know. Serious question : people drink mask on? Also many employees tested. them? care what?

Exactly. pandemic. Nothing perfect.

However, hospitals overrun cases falling due policies put place. Compared states, handled well.

Considering larger NYC area hit hard even half information now, started extreme disadvantage well.

And 2nd highest cases now. think we're unfortunately seeing challengers. stop letting stupid people take lead one cares. Stop salty. way presidential elections work.

And Dems want change either. know could help win point.

This bizarre gripe. think thrown window. certain common sense taken back behind shed given two head. I’ve called polls cell phone. Common sense case requires caring life others cannot quidproquo future due anonymity modern life. really. safe bet people develop immunity sure see “fake news”. It’s arguing wether 5k+ deaths pneumonia covid related. Hard believe jump pneumonia deaths coincidence. saying collection asault rifles large pickup sign strength?

/s People strong lungs chest mind little breathe resistance thin layers fabrics. that’s right. thank everyone wearing masks selfish pricks Tennessee same. numbers going either one believes don’t care. went store last week first time since started ( usually grocery pickup) one people wearing mask. shocking. Hey thanks! protesters looters different people. anyway, there's little evidence coronavirus spread due protests. Yeah that’s fair assessment, sort reverse ‘If Tree falls’ analogy.

I say far agreement Christian belief God simply created Big Bang. way, it’s sort like scientists rational thinkers believe true, Christians take step further.

Where gets less believable - - Christian belief earth 10,000 years old, evolution isn’t real. anyone noticed covid making pretty big geographical march right US? initial epicenters north. Washington, Oregon, Chicago, New York. epicenters south...Florida, Texas, Arizona. I've severely anxious. I've also getting mild asthma attacks every day. can't tell anxiety causing I'm anxious asthma worry getting corona bad asthma flair up. year sucks.  Deaths lag 2-4 weeks increase testing. already helped kids research timeline kids school project. already timeline news briefings bookmarked that's know people posting lies making stuff up. Mwahaha escaped auto-delete. never worn mask whole pandemic. haven’t caught Covid Really?

Why would talk Italy, Spain France?

Italy (worst hit country Europe) 21k infected population 60m. number falling STEADILY every day.

Give one month less 5k infected.

And despite country actually started spreading.

The lockdown worked. people masks.

Disprove that. Australia ain't bad either, NZ showing us way. hate seen far behind neighbour.

2 active cases state, discovered hotel quarantine, travellers must stay. next medical genius live Philly area area Lehigh valley third largest area Pa reopened week ago doesn’t include bars masks mandatory. restrictions ease people get comfy large areas see increase cases. Right it’s way soon say creates dangerous false sense security. 80 degrees extremely uncomfortable. wonder anti mask stuff coming south warmer climates. beginning remember whistleblower saying TSA even using gloves masks kind screening. days started hearing positive cases america. I'm surprised i'm hearing again. done things properly start maybe could caught borders. we'll shut afternoon ""deep cleaning"" entire staff tested positive we'll open business morning still good sounds wonderful. Although speaking German might me. Im thinkin New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, maybe Australia keep fires control. Lol really medication treatment *to* deal though, unless they're super sick hospital. friend quite sick since March, sick enough hospital. Really reason ever ""visits"" doctor sign paperwork excuse work. Ahh forget soon... South Korea Religious cult outbreak.

Look forgotten. Democratic republics form democracy. core pillar democracy fair elections, electoral college US Senate fail provide fair election. always true degree now. obviously actually care fair elections. care semantics right. electoral college voted people That's things work. see spike 2 weeks unless significant portion people rally already infected. see couple (likely) smaller clusters pop around people there, ~2-3 weeks see spike. 

Now, like, 2-3% people rally already infected prior going, might see sudden spike 2 week window, likely. far like 1-2 people pass another 20-30 people, several small clusters pop around 20-30 people, explode properly isolate distance. Oof get weirdest vibe watching live cams. Excess deaths Texas twice COVID deaths. happened Heathrow. didn’t lock airport made take every single thing bag. kind freaked pulled camera lens wrapped sock. Never figured set sensor I’m pretty sure got put sort list literally every time I’ve flown internationally since then, I’ve go additional screening. people talking breaking hospitals? Well, we’ll see two week Trump still president not. care what? better get cocky. Pandemics bragging rights much right see old people young people wearing masks near me. twice many tests compared May 1. back nationwide percent positive 15%, it’s 5% now. 

Some states undeniably worse right now, USA whole isn’t nearly bad 7 weeks ago. Hopefully enough people wear masks stays way. didnt try months ago? Oh, flu? Makes sense. dude government hoarding. peepees dont care listen hear truth say “fuck goverment” start raiding store face masks. think leadership pretty much knows country works selfish core drive away prevent chaos hoarding

we saw TP wasnt even crucial item lol 

 hand sanitizer wipes - shit went away FAST lockdown called in.......and didnt even put rules things all. GONE people manufacture sell mom pop santizer....


Masks went next think even declared shortage restrictions,if recall correctly.....im guessing online venues manufacturers told government sell keep stock going supply. Thats precipitated mask donation movement NYC turned Hell.

High demand coupled hoarding.

I honestly dont think bullshitting public telling truth would made difference - either way masks shit would still sold out.....All find surgical ones stylish fabric ones exhaust ports. goes wipes sanitizer - still sold out, truth told valuable use cdc....and still stock.


anyway thats think.  I'd encourage go. mental health matters too. Unfortunately hitting Africa several dozen countries without much testing capability. South Africa, Oman Egypt reporting thousand cases day distances 3 huge likely spread across whole continent. Sad part is, say native South Florida, we’ve got businesses struggling grateful open again, slurping shit social media serves (THAT MASK VIOLATES RIGHTS AMERICAN!), businesses shut again. can’t get way. I’ve never seen anything like it. Ha! I’m Irish American people. us lived lives ready go yet! [Instead doubling down, ask people saying consider perpetuating racism. Plenty space. Hope feel better soon. Plus, Arizona heat batteries breakdown quicker. never going completely gone learn live *out regular lives* though wont vaccine.  can’t tell many times fiancé (semi-jokingly) discussed moving Europe ends. we’re US state that’s taking seriously! Previously, ""pre-existing condition"", insurance company could deny purchasing 'services' entirely. ACA, ended ability insurance companies deny person purchasing insurance coverage. 

However, purchasing coverage, insurance companies still allowed deny coverage ""pre-existing conditions"" period 12 months start service, providing coverage new ailments 'immediately' following start service.

Its dumb. wait staff wears masks tables close together, I'd OK it. cunt racist sexist definition "" unpleasant stupid person choir! sure Oxford, room im familiar 6 people cash tournament tables 5 people table games. great we're page proved point three times three comments piss miserable prick. think rather safe say extremely self focused position. Life life regardless age. ... goes summarize evidence available. insignificant irrelevant. Again, nothing scientifically proven currently it’s barely couple months since covid widespread. doesn’t mean isn’t evidence. article cites describes doctors seeing. must one people enjoys purposefully obtuse internet kicks.  wish society could make people think coronaviris real/that bad express belief front ghost +100k dead Americans. Let's see still think fake then. Funny long things last spend week supply chain sitting warehouses. alternative?? 

Do think really stop people dying? 

If kept 10 people dying per day, would say also horrible? 3 day? 

Is 0 deaths per day acceptable outcome? realistic.  Come Port Huron lol.. wearing it, covering nose chin. I'm finding teenage daughter challenging. even understands risks (and high risks family members) friends gave pandemic month ago. friends tease even sending snaps hanging time too. 🤦‍♂️ I’m entirely disagreeing you, CCP wasn’t forthcoming severity situation..

So, like every country nursing homes meatpacking plants?

Indeed, singling China weirder now. article...
1. Abbot complain people wearing face masks. Seriously passing blame. 

2. Hospital cases risen age group many don’t symptoms. rise increased testing. 

My opinion: working seeing friends stay away high risk family members honest people come contact amount people interacting party make informed decision whether see them. know opinion unpopular. Mars, maybe. Exactly around three weeks ago social distancing went window Belfast/ Lisburn. lucky lack social distancing outside. bad sounds I've using test see safe conclusion gained apart odd cluster, community transmission must extremely low rate even three weeks ago little effect another, often overlooked, reason lockdowns. purpose never indefinitely lock irradiate virus find vaccine, shift infections time treatments could developed. shame media can't cover this. criminal negligence. reality US learned literally nothing 1918 pandemic even states would act absence President giving orders late. Also, CDC basically useless. could stop virus, could cure it, waited way long tell people wear masks basically dont authority anything. lmao chance hell Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  argue logic them. Comparison tough many reasons, especially consider bad testing access everywhere world (and continues be) Europe Northeastern US hit hard. Differences reporting standards tricky too. 
 
I think fair say way many people died US EU neither perfect response. really first time something like happened lifetimes. means numbers exaggerated based number reasons:

-Adding antibodies positive tests
-Harvesting cases week old 
-placing several days build one two days
-focusing hot spots (contact tracing FL doing)
-Focusing testing communities positive tests come (what FL also doing)
-Suspected cases

Basically data pulled hasn’t checked true increase cases. Merely better job finding people indeed coronavirus mild symptoms. Neither Italy France.

In fact, China country first detected it. Italy France failed there, too. can't. Anything say, even published research get ""yea trust science"" reply. worth energy. Yeah tons NY/NJ here. hate say think lot came avoid stricter enforcement social distancing there. Like said season here, there's big events going time year anyway.. traffic think major golf tournament going around here. see return replaced healthier people. may see short careers. Since April 4, data agency shows 413.9% increase newly reported COVID-19 cases among 21-30 age group, 966.1% increase newly reported COVID-19 cases among 11-20 age group. data follows national trends indicate growing number young adults youth confirmed COVID-19. Holy cow. Now, thing is, hospital’s trusted? defiantly ignorant folks screamed “over counting get $13k more” it. there’s this. don’t know wth going anymore. bunch people drive infect 'everyone'. Relative number residents state, number visitors small.

And black white thing either people seem think. coronavirus 'under control', means r0 &lt;1 residents. random people coming infecting people (in reality, slightly higher infection rates maybe slightly worse adherence social distancing/mask wearing) result higher amount cases substantially affect state-wide r0 people eventually leave. Here's latest chart South Carolina's cases/deaths. Cases spiking, far deaths remain flat:

 currently South Carolina currently ranked #31 terms per capita deaths, 12.21 per 100k old Devil went Georgia again... like saying clean room gets dirty again. child's logic. Apparently aren't. reading response straight PGA website. playing partners still even scheduled play next week despite might even test positive soon even positive.

They keep going yes, unfair players NBA teams one team kicked bubble.  coworkers clinical care specialists? Interesting. Criticism mishandling situation literally referred hoax... rebutted arguments data, dismissed hoax. Making issue subject extreme rhetoric gate fueled utter clusterfuck point wearing mask political much country. Crazy failure leadership. Oh yeah restaurants I’ve driven masks, maybe one group them. Got it.

You support thousands protesters 

Not hypocrite all. Keep good work know else would bad mental health? Catching covid Go youtube search videos COVID conspiracy theories. lot literally believe existence viruses bacteria. disease overblown viruses bacteria deep state hoax. Yeah, Sweden country developed world chose stuck herd immunity policy. Everyone else opted supression leading Test, Trace, Isolate. several examples TTI relatively successful suppressing disease course months now. 

Which ofc Sweden pivoting (albeit slowly baby steps) towards TTI: knows herd immunity policy failure (even admit outright) now, thankfully, least making baby steps towards moving adopt policy works. open question TTI work country high caseload like Sweden has, thikn certainyl help give optimal results. dude almost certainly trolling you, one naturally dense. Thanks comments though! Tell coworker give up. Yeah stats look pretty good, although 3x positive test rate compared NY (but still low). generational hate, like blaming millennials Honestly point need make wearing masks required public. wanted believe people would responsible it’s happening, people don’t care. doctor knows answer either. Coronavirus common us - that's difference. forefinger ready I'm saying mask usage ""all nothing"" proposition. 

If dentist wears mask working someone's teeth immediately takes leaves actual operatory, make sense?

No, virus present, disappear leaves operatory. 

If someone restaurant COVID-19, eats meal restaurant, everyone exposed COVID-19. reference, nearly ten times many Washington amount people. around 400 positives yesterday..... Vote whom? None candidates side donor class. 18.7? merely flesh wound even worse. including serology testing results.

3,519 new serological tests, total positive 3.0%. Let's assume 5.0% today.

3,519 * 0.05 = 176. 3,109 - 176 = 2,933 PCR positives.

New PCR Tests = 13,058. 2933/13058 = 22.5% positive. Gregg Abbot best screw up. told us enough hospital beds state everybody. doesn’t want people wear masks. wants schools reopen ZERO Covid prevention measures. Every day Texas gets record numbers doubles finds way screw everybody even Eh. I’ve seen California’s positive-test percentage actually going down. numbers seem related tests.
 
Florida’s positive-test percentage increasing. shame time explain really. guess trust anyway since say solid. fine. South always needs something angry about, give COVID scream at. much winning. Urgent clinic testing spot next house Pasco county. morning drove several times 9am 10am. packed. Scary even. People standing outside clinic. Cars line wrapped around parking lot. Pasco pretty small busy three times went looked like moving cars line fairly quickly. shocked. bad guys, getting worse. much winning! Don’t lose faith humanity, lose faith America. lot humanity correctly. America shit show right feeds llama-industrial complex. guess lawmakers hoping voting retired persons ""expire"" next election? 

That's bold move, Cotton. Let's see pays off... backlog bit 20'000 cases, remember correctly. India recently day 2000 deaths instead less 500, also backlog. happened before, though usually happens deaths new cases. Karma. clarified growth total cases per day. 

If growth new cases goes 0.0%, instead cases:  n: 385,142(+0.1%) 17,502(+0.42%)  n+1: 385,760(+0.2%) 17,587(+0.49%)

You cases:  n: 385,760(+0.0%) 17,587(+0.0%)  n+1: 385,760(+0.0%) 17,587(+0.0%)

Then yes, definition sustained 0.0% growth magic number virus congratulated disappeared. 10,000 100,000 active cases w/e, there's new cases active ones eventually resolve virus gone. 

\+0.1% smaller number 0.42%. 

Also perfect example warp statistics headline comment supports whatever opinion is. need look numbers think critically numbers whispers you, make opinion. Headlines like, ""Big number, record, highest ever, compared to"" meaningless full context. 

The growth total cases slowing since explosive growth March doubling every 7 days, shit real panic moment, growth continued, would 1 billion cases today, there's 8.7 million cases worldwide today, chill. growth steadily slowed since March doubling every 7 days every 33 days start June every 37 days today. 

If spike ""surge"", still plenty time deal it, dire middle March. panicking bad situation is, maybe wait situation we're worse state 2 weeks ago. growth slow, plenty time watch monitor growth reacting, open shit see worsens, there's real urgency anymore. testing staying numbers keeps rising can’t keep blaming tests you??!??!!!??! Maybe protest virus demand defund it. scale 1 10 it’s Florida bad. Yep, pretty much! Tom Cotton. usual, proof. need test every single person population TTI properly. need test infected contacts. fact, Norway came said need test much due low prevalence, Iceland too. 

What see [rolling 7 day average deaths outbreak Europe general coming lockdowns, staying way *targeted*, smart implementation TTI. Given financial impacts, I’m sure they’re pulling stops. Good thing tour it’s still workable multiple players out, think they’ll fine.

Given stats outcomes 40 &amp; healthy folks I’d worried volunteers mostly older retirees. Players walk 4 miles everyday living fine. legislative process hijacked billionaire class. government exists serve billionaire class constituency.
VOTE go restaurant remove mask eat, effectively made wearing restaurant lobby wearing public place waste time. 

You illogical. remove “with strangers”. don’t know fuck people know outside work. go work Stupid people easier time accessing stupid ideas via Facebook. honestly wish site would burn ground. Meanwhile, 14-day running average deaths Arizona Arizona currently 17.98 deaths per 100k Quality comment, thank you. Yep, could imagine many ppl also equally shocked regarding Sweden too!

Especially praising Sweden almost daily pre-virus..  I'm doctor can't really say affected not, doctors Brazil saying. said, history dealing well respiratory diseases common us, scientists worried well way saw rhey flat said nobody buy mask medics need them, im sure would massive hoarding, general mistrust government....and course Trump office..... idea, stay home leave everybody else alone. btw, virus black plague. That’s thing. People aren’t consistent principles think. People fought tooth nail seatbelt law came out. people it. us! countries locked worse death rate Sweden,

And would obviously even worse one. think many people states read news decide Michigan great place take vacation... checked math solid. sorry understand statistics work. case, solid argument backed several times several ways. Quite impressive actually.

I wish patience possessed walk math. get extremely angry see age group wearing mask. Yeah fine old underlying condition? Stop damn selfish wear fu!!ing mask!! Sorry vent. dumbest source I've seen long time.  anyone ELI5? glenmark's fabiflu? didn’t would get downvote brigade. President Fox News model. Repeat stupid people already think back love it. first point real killer. wanted control information political reasons, wanted monopoly testing. late working fucked first generation testing. Partisan politics incompetence top meant everywhere US flying blind. state/local could proactive, imho undoubtedly would actual data point to... folks turned back hospitals even exhibiting symptoms unless recent travel history china bc simply tests. Insane. where's social distancing rules? followed? Bro, shut up. Fuck. think brain shut trying wrap around insanity. u/award-cost-bot Won’t happen.

Illinois, get this? wait till Americans realize Europe gets live sports Americans continue politicize mask wearing mitigation/containment think see 10 days since started day ago business essential ones closed two months. Basically, grocery/pharmacy/food/car repair/gas stations open. Everything else closed. 20-0 even half time.

Not half time? said peak Sweden already past [march (then [3 days April...)? me.     
Who said ""herd immunity"" - ""not strategy"" hoped praised every briefing; come May, June? me.  ppl like idiots selfish af period would pretty surprised rally cancelled, especially numbers keep going next days national alarm Arizona’s outbreak grows. isn’t, look Phoenix hospitals. I’m mobile searching tough, browse r/COVID19 search Vitamin D. number studies month ago show correlation. Mainly around majority deaths virus severe vitamin deficiency. could cytokine response depleting reserve deficient beforehand, regardless something behind it. seen Jfc.

But, white collar crime, one cares.

The police murder someone busted wrong house try catch someone pot possession.

But hold door open CEOs they're way kill employees negligence. Yep that's one have. look good, I'm blood thinner already, might help. say Covid coagulates blood lot causes clotting/strokes. I'm already anticoagulants though, maybe it'll counter it, maybe not. stay alive long enough hopes better treatment! imagine happens hurricane hits... ok, link data shows ""Most"" people died corona virus seniors sent nursing homes. 

Absolutely ludicrous trying claim true. also clear anti-science push, would argue perpetuated social media. believe smarter “experts”. example - someone arguing Facebook masks actually make sicker you’re breathing back virus repeatedly. absolutely real evidence back course. they've decided risk worth it, guess. I've decided go gym reopen Michigan next week. I'm aware real risk I've accepted that. looks good Beijing people followed social distancing guidelines.

The percentage people aged 65 older US 14.9 percent. Florida, number 20 percent, projected 25 percent year 2030 (this pre-pandemic though). Also: ""Florida adds quarter-million additional residents year 2030, majority new residents – 57 percent – age 60 older.""

It’s mess. know *meant* statements, whether said clearly not. realize I’m writing sounds hell lot like Trump Cult member saying “he didn’t lie that’s meant even though that’s said.” point much defend CDC COVID task force public health officials. 

I personally believe messaging would much clearer responsible leadership POTUS wasn’t actively trying cover extent spread manipulate public buying/wearing masks, continuing business usual, etc... would said POTUS trying prevent run masks, realize he’s anti-mask general, probably part makes look like shouldn’t traveling spending money hotels. we’d POTUS let experts guide policy 100%, don’t think ever would needed shut begin with. could months ahead curve. believe officials bending twisting message reconcile Trump’s demands vs public needs. bit abstraction discussion here.

My real point CURRENT mask guidelines appropriate, weren’t entirely appropriate two months ago doesn’t mean opposite everything public health officials say now. It’s sad we’ve lost much trust government, even sadder good reason lose trust. 

One thing though: said statement cloth/surgical masks effective preventing wearer infection “lie”. suited preventing wearer *spreading* infection, protect wearer *everyone* wearing one. logically must offer *some* protection inhaling aerosolized airborne droplets, main benefit prevent transmission. Please explain think lie. 

When explaining, please clarify kind mask whether it’s individual/public transmission/contraction you’re referring to. qualifiers matter much conversations, hardly public discussion masks makes effort specify.

Anything happens two weeks now, affect Q2 results. didn’t see picture according another comment, woman handing masks wearing mask. inaccurate reached 26 multiple times past week. Headline prediction 1 2 weeks now: ""Hundreds attendees Tulsa Trump rally test positive coronavirus."" It’s sad poor unemployed saw 4 masks pictures lol, good.

They handing masks hopefully gets slightly better? yet still offer alternative. mask thing part religion conformity elaborate point?

tools toolbox usually ask color, replacing God state, non conformity threat objective  Ya colleges know damm well they're gonna lose huge enrollment numbers go online possibly schools don't. Agreed. thing keeps burning populous pace, going start encounter resistance sheer fact less 'lower hanging' targets. **Abstract** 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic caused SARS-CoV-2 emerged December 2019 China resulted 7.8 million infections 430,000 deaths worldwide, imposing urgent need rapid development efficient cost-effective vaccine, suitable mass immunization. Here, generated replication competent recombinant VSV-ΔG-spike vaccine, glycoprotein VSV replaced spike protein SARS-CoV-2. vitro characterization recombinant VSV-∆G-spike indicated expression presentation spike protein viral membrane antigenic similarity SARS-CoV-2. golden Syrian hamster vivo model COVID-19 implemented. show vaccination hamsters recombinant VSV-ΔG-spike results rapid potent induction neutralizing antibodies SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination able protect hamsters SARS-CoV-2 challenge, demonstrated abrogation body weight loss immunized hamsters compared unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed minor lung pathology, viral load. Taken together, suggest recombinant VSV-ΔG-spike safe, efficacious protective vaccine SARS-CoV-2 infection. First thing first degree geography degree science, treating one wild.

I person noticed today wearing face mask... 

Vancouver, Canada That’s get hooked Yea it’s uncomfortable - “extremely” much. human, ability adapt extreme conditions! Wearing face covering walk park. fun fashion statement. 😀 gun nuts really insert guns literally everywhere Happy Cake Day! Deaths lag behind cases, sure still difficult comprehend. 

If uptick cases, uptick deaths unless virus becomes less deadly. younger population means less hospitalizations zero hospitalizations. Infect enough young people short period time problem hospital capacity. forget athletes died coronavirus? Almost disproven dead cells testing positive person never getting rid reactivation (like person Australia). still dont single confirmed case someone it, completely beat it, got someone else. Agreed, trust broken, one cares Fauci says anymore Fauci lied straight face national TV. 

Somehow Chinese government right, issued wear mask recommendation national TV day 1 confirmed human human transmission January 22nd, despite also mask shortage first weeks. 

They mandated mask usage national shutdown began February. HEPA filters pretty incredible - air cabin passes filter every 2 3 minutes whole flight. 

Honestly, given that, air probably less risky local grocery store.  condition becoming worrisome every passing day. India Brazil started blow up, China (Beijing) United States facing resurge cases. best cases controlled everywhere time. Especially ADA apply airline passengers. Air travel governed Air Carrier Access Act. increases hospitalization? Testing too? doesn’t help called “macho men” like Joe Rogan calling people wear masks pussies. They’re doctors treat medical patients believed real doctors. states ICU’s danger eating words soon. Maybe lot people loss loved ones still able come delusions. 

I saw comment FB post lady claimed Dad died hospital NY. said doctors falsified death certificate say COVID part deep state. said probably hated Trump got money saying died COVID. said stop everyone knows ""truth"". 

Sadly, believe many people deeply entrenched conspiracy theories death close loved one enough shake it.  Yes. course is. virus spread? 🤷🤔 That’s Keys don’t medical capacity mainland. Medical resources spread different keys main ones Key West. wishing harm people, indirectly, gets banned here. we're smart enough know villages large retirement community central florida seniors high risk complications covid.  fuck people make people! NBA plan creative good, outdoor baseball bad October. leagues would theoretically playing October. 


It's small crucial variables details one make stances perfectly reasonable case. 



In MLB discussion, stated *late* October, specifically, ideal that's colder weather tends arrive; that's *outdoor* baseball smart *all way October* like plan suggested. However, *might* still OK, said, went bubble plan players (like NBA), even crowd might OK, kept low capacity. Level active regional transmission virus time would play crowd size limitation decisions. 



The NBA, hand, would finishing playoffs *early* October, indoors, Florida, removing cold weather factor influences MLB hesitation. Football needs bubble second coronavirus wave. Today comes says it’s inevitable second wave even happen. 



This one easier comprehend quickly reflective broader realities play, becomes clear minimal reflection there's really even logical conflict going someone simultaneously holds following two positions:



(a) *due continued international outbreak growing exponentially, combined astonishing bungling across country interventions CDC urged/urges, due nature past pandemics*, **a 2nd wave almost certainly going happen** [**and, such, advise NFL based strong assumption**]



(b) that, technically, (1) somehow nation, successfully CDC calls (imagine that!), across states, enough drive transmission down, (2) also get lucky coronavirus storm back regardless interventions, like past influenza virus pandemics have, **we could get lucky avoid second wave**. 



He knows unlikely, technically impossible. non-sports driven interview he's positive pointing 2nd wave ""inevitable"" - **isn't**, governments (and public) would read understand defensive playbook get try execute important plays. know 40 million work I'm one damn that's lot marching.

You clear table (just dump thing nearby). servers NEVER came table could alone group without masks on. 

We sat outside far away everyone else felt pretty safe. Hope healthy children. Nah, I’m big weeb. It’s real fucking sanctimonious way telling others breathe. Thanks explaining. protest argument 'never going wear one' make sense. inconvenient rights narrative. completely ignorable standards long kills old. testing increasing steadily? There’s sudden increase testing believable.

Wrong. Good thing young population isn’t plagued underlying conditions like obesity, high blood pressure dia-beetus...oh wait. I'd settle cheap rapid test kits, proven treatment procedures curb symptoms early stages maybe stopping progress disease. Eventually covid19 becoming another disease could treated pills require hospitalization.

They HIV 20++ years. accurate depiction area mitten well.

Need keep clowns Chicago western MI I'm old enough remember coronavirus alarming new cases mostly old people preexisting medical issues. Rules...

You might random.. want vacation. sick states requires masks and/or lockdowns come Florida. Florida encouraging tourists support economy. Theme parks open. Disney scheduled open. think idea movie theatres opening idiotic, especially optional mask policy. can’t keep customers safe don’t even try opening. It’s recover profits, BS.

Just people allowed sit eat groups restaurants, doesn’t mean requiring places useless. I’m sure would think that. Rules put place whether required required mask doesn’t necessary make right way things.

Masks shown effective reducing virus transmission, would wearing place useless? executives movie theatre chain making optional place business? shouldn’t wear elsewhere?

So sorry mom. It’s bizarre people think mask stopping “living life.”  Bull god master plan fail talked respectfully would come back? Gawrsh Mickey, somethin'? looks control many western countries lock down, germany, finland, norway, denmark, australia, new zealand even italy now. mixed bag. looks like many eastern countries cant keep control, india, middle east etc Vaccine effective treatment available.

I previously asked question, asking? Another thing Americans hard time understanding truth changes. inherent science, never static. Yet people see changes information reason brand new findings “fake news”. Oh yeah don’t answer all. don’t know number don’t answer. listen voicemails though laugh. Can’t scam don’t even understand saying lol embarrass people wearing one.

""Men refuse wear masks pandemic must tiny dicks."" young... something love one way aisles shopping nicely point store one way aisles, I'm told go f myself, one guy said care store does, others oh know continue walk aisles wrong way. Americans selfish (not all) virus proven correct. 

As Country even shut 30 days without ppl bitching, following guidelines even POTUS bitching following Administrations guidelines. countries shutdown 90 days. closure slow virus hot spots explode areas people follow guidelines. X doubt defend? pointed inflation fact still went use word ""shitty"" describing them. ""Half time""? talking about? kind bars frequent? go bar, sit bar, order drink, served. think people going keep mask sips?

and specially internet reddit :/ experience needed And? Yep. 1. sterile. 
    2. standardized test tube holder size. 
    3. USELESS. Shall, since nice guy answers questions vehement attitude, hope watch children die cancer. totally agree bourgeoisie don’t want proletariat critical thinkers. That’s direct conflict staying power. working class easier manipulate control they’re poor, tired, uneducated fight injustice. public education slowly defunded last decades. Look result. rich richer powerful ever, significant portion common population aren’t equipped motivated anything it. Hang immediately. huge influx robo calling China using messages like ""Chinese embassy"" ""Visa extension denied"" try get people call back. already present since 2010's gotten exponentially worse since pandemic. think worst part knowing companies sold information low life scum shit. That's understatement understand polling methods measures taken insure polls meaningful? actually waiting see happens..... We're locked he's exagerating lot. meet family there's 10 person limit gatherings (which people going anyway). Also businesses opened back now. also really see people wearing masks unless healthcare related area older person. Everyone opinion equal vote. That's populism anti-science works. wrong say things like then, wrong endorse now. state attendees would expected kind event, making good example look future event planners. 

Out state attendees eat, sleep, shop Tulsa town. 

And state attendees affect hosting big event affects ICUs Tulsa. 

Take seat, you’re argumentative argue YES! Media headlines worst misdirect! People damn lazy read article question headline look multiple sources. drives nuts.  Masks signs hate him. Thought read NY going Florida going forward. short, active cases includes people currently sick. Whereas recovered cases accumulated since beginning pandemic, including every patient ever recovered covid.

Therefore recovery percentage going increase time. Football started back week. Horse racing started last week. Empty stadiums, live tv free view. southern MI? greater Detroit, like 90% people wearing masks stores. Tru/\/\p sue probably win, like Tulsa. Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled Tulsa can’t force masks social distancing event. Compare Michigan's numbers today Florida, Arizona Texas.

I'd say matters lot! No, comparing football basketball. see anyone could think football worse. 

And agree, can't make baseball safe, there's chance sports.

This really bad time sports. already Exactly. two Governor's got kinds shit right. Whitmer even got death threats bad state capital close.
But look two states track control still find way blame Whitmer Cuomo praise Trump would describe March-May neutral, June 1st gear twlk shit they've never there. Yeah.... ICUs 43% since April 15 though. Mortality rates going too. Worldometer serious cases 2% worldwide asymptomatic mild 98% now. Stop fear mongering. Universities schools reopen fall, least campus classes. measures universities plan implement enough, meant limit liability, continuing bring money housing meal plan fees.  criminally underreported issue pandemic. One reasons people taking seriously see estimated (extrapolated) mortality rates 1% high recovery rates.

""Recovered"" mean end things affected. ""Recovered"" means ""tested negative"". That's literally it, terribly, deceptively misleading. People need shown bad survive. Surviving barely matters surviving, can't get bed, quality life shitter. media needs focusing on, constantly. Imagine thinking assholes plan. Yep like said, sub-optimal getting job done avoiding trouble/charges. Optimal protection whole different story lol tweet well known crackpot well. US cut pay, deny appropriate equipment safe, generally take advantage willingness serve. I'm one states disease relatively control sickened way people acting. There's huge drop mask usage point feel ostracized even using one. Meanwhile tourist hub states around us increasing case numbers. could possibly go wrong?  believe state imposed regulations making local mask orders difficult implement. Texans seem banking wide open spaces protecting people care coronavirus taking care whomever left. ...on Fox news? They're either talking Android phone theyre making shit up.  Defeatist? read comment? People dying disease millennia. eradicated many all. SARS went away know why. AIDS still thing. Ebola, MERS, flu, Hepatitis. identified diseases 100% fatality rates exist world right now. vaccines treatments exist them. study learn avoid contracting made disappear. we're trying Covid-19. Understand prevent people contracting it. Here's truth, someone almost certainly die COVID-19 2025. like someone die AIDS year failed take precautions. New Zealand recently declared free disease. reported three new cases past week. Cases increasing places deaths declining. Shutting world prevent death one thing, shutting prevent people getting sick week something entirely different. people still freak see someone wearing mask public urban legend point scientists never produced successful vaccine coronavirus.

...in humans. many article summed ""no shit, Sherlock""  See above-- liked question much added original! Let’s see data then. I’d like see recent data too, lockdown-related deaths people scared call 911. would buy time. like china travel restrictions, buying time helpful use take actions. govt not... waited criticsm handling virus could longer derided hoax shamed addressing it. states surrounding Ontario, excellent. I... think going even try go back lockdown. think anyone gives fuck anymore. smarter first place stayed put. oh well. NY/NJ white Jewish communities try skirt quarrantine throw celebrations many times. Hence, statements need data. people also need respect choosing return normalcy given current statistics / probability contracting COVID Michigan.

There return normalcy till treatment vaccine. reason cases covid-19 Michigan lock down, social distancing wearing masks; people stop things begin spreading like before.

Not wearing mask social distancing point like closing umbrella middle rainstorm getting wet. right

But countering someone chosen blame disaster handled it. country likely late implement WHO's advice, way early reverse advice. ignored fact commended china get go , enforced strictest lockdown modern history, canadians Americans bitching mild lockdown, would even call that. I'm essential worker observed people gathering canada entire time. 

God forbid hold countries leaders accountable. see writing wall early January, large number redditors did. 

Their goal likely avoid panic , worked part. get sit back hope result panic, doesnt fuck us ass whiners like Joe Rogan call ppl wearing masks bitches, horde followers already obeyed anything said covid came along. costs fall poor

&amp;#x200B;

So deaths virus

&amp;#x200B;

In fact everything falls poor like always Corona humanity running amock. awful governmental response real issue manage protect vulnerable.

The U.S. projected 200,000 deaths spite lockdown, idea naive.  want everyone able discuss conversation needs stay topic Coronavirus (i.e., relates Covid-19, derail off-topic political conversations) remain civil.

**Wishing celebrating harm/death (this includes wishing Covid-19 anyone) 14 day ban, thread locked types comments.**

Please keep civil. Florida shut schools 6k total cases. schools fully opened come August breaking records daily.

How make sense anyone brain? 

Unless masks become mandatory statewide, going explode soon we'll see 10k cases daily.

Do part people, wear fucking mask!! People shit governor &amp; look pulled off. Amazing. could guessed going scientists &amp; doctors right way go?! Ah yes, Catholic atheist protestant one? No. politicize everything, even medical science. county whopping 5 total cases 1 death.

Depends are. German data mandated daily testing done, people hospitalized, die.

We small weekly wave daily data, less reported weekend people working testing centers. numbers show Mon/Tue.

You can't really get much ""real time"" that. think sports teams back restart. went Florida's laws, safety...

I think Sweden’s greatest failure theefold: 

1. Slow reactions. Everything later everybody else. Always sted behind. 

2. Bad leadership: didn’t politicians took charge made things right nationally beginning. let communes fend find protective gear, gave ambigious test instructions funding etc. Plus, let citizens shoulder measures. know, citizens don’t trust drink death without systembolaget.

3. never adapted new knowledge came. countries didn’t go lockdown suppress virus, buy time mitigate till known. Later changed suppress strategy became evident could done. Sweden stuck strat (well, stealth changing test-trace denying so...) matter new scientific articles proved wrong caculated spread/antibody levels may/mortality chances suppression/masks etc. Ok median rent one bedroom (the $1340 one bedroom) $1340 median worker income L.A. around $30,000 pandemic (and that's generous; believe like $26,000, sake argument, let's say $30,000), least half renters spending 54% income rent. 

Ridiculous. supposed save house, retirement circumstances? god forbid want take vacation, get sick unexpected doctor bill. totally fucked. wonder tens thousands houseless people - simply can't afford live here. plan never reopen lower cases. buy time prepare Favipiravir oral antiviral approved treatment influenza Japan. selectively inhibits RNA polymerase, necessary viral replication.

Also coworkers planning state trips bad cancel plans?  ""What person wants, person needs two seperate things."" despite idiots apparently knowing wear one properly (covering mouth leaving nose exposed), virtually everyone wears mask far I've seen. 

This great news Miami, unfortunately that's case counties. I'm Lee people give fuck essential workers. neighborhood still crowding around pool together, group dinners, holding HOA meetings, etc., zero masks.

Plus NHL wanting complete playoffs. MLB looking start season. might MLB season play division rivals that’s it. riots looting already did. Trying original Sweden response now.

Let's see works take look /r/COVID19positive find many threads filled people regular runners, athletes fitness buffs types still barely walk minutes without crashing back days. fit seems offer little protection.

And common pattern exertion triggers illness, defining symptom post-viral illness ME/CFS, athletes likely advised rest. mostly seems chance know more. *another candidate. 

""The other"" misnomer. 2 candidates. Da fuck, 20k seats? truth hurts, sorry Lol. Ouch Fake news sure, would continue spreading. would take least generations spreading really become noticeable country-wide level. take time (and looks like country-wide numbers going go lot anyway. 

I'm saying big deal. I'm saying big deal get swamped spread int country whole. Amazing Doesn’t matter you’re packed shoulder shoulder streets. NS wear masks still higher risk people  Yikes. Sorry, friend. hope things turn okay.  would thought said. SCOTUS delayed repeal DACA, saying could still Trump follow correct process. think America's institutions good job enforcing constitution. ""rape""? Country territory would better definition. Denizens NI right choose Irish British passport, both. thing going face p100 n95. need vaccines! need take poor lab techs hostage rush vaccines! Switch “reader view” see article without ad top it. took 30 mins vent story run battery power, guess family figured whatever unplugged wasn’t important first it. see issue fact patient ICU healthcare worker noticed full 30 minutes vent unplugged/running battery back-up Half brain big ask 2020. Hahaha, yeah, movie theaters starting open here, live performance venues still shut down. That’s good info hear! Except every scientist study said natural origin created lab yes, know better doctors scientists, vast conspiracy lie this? Shake head stop easily disproven falsehoods. don’t know made lab not? Use google, read information understand vs spewing baloney Apparently different Spring Break. Biggest difference Texans see 90 think, well 100 better go outside take advantage cool weather go walk. Michiganders see 85 think, holy fuck blazes. Better stay inside crank AC hot.

Northern's tolerate heat well all. Hospices palliative care death imminent(median length around 6 weeks). 

Nursing home median time stay(usually ending death) six months.  

A nursing home retirement community, assisted living facility. people require 24/7 care go. contradict anything said? masks ""placebo"" like guy interviewed said, account dramatic increase hospitalizations? Dumbass. Nope never happen I'm sure that's got alot resurgence States, possibly larger factor populous states reopening. I’m disputing that.

However, comparing general running state Florida world-famous efficiency Germany would foolish best. Honestly "" best"" news source anymore. median age confirmed infected people ""plunged"" 37 statewide, said, according Orlando Sentinel. Orange County, median age 29. Seminole County makes sense, ones think hurts older people.
 
I confirm multiple coworkers, driving across state lines hit bars. saying mask usage mandated? Wearing mask easy, too. He's taking medieval multiplying get total. wrong math. 

Probabilities averages. Internet ready crucify kids Florida going beaches spring break. think lock again. *shouldn't*.

We definitely should. faith government really level anymore. fucking disaster  bet among doctors statue dedicated racist one, let's destroy statue! I'm NJ. Restrictions loosened week. There's longer lines get stores outdoor dining open restaurants. Monday, gathering 250 people parking lot show cars. Practically one wearing mask. Police parked cars corner stayed vehicles. People wearing graduation gowns family get togethers bigger restaurants like 30 people group. NJ 2nd hardest hit US. People wanna get back normal cant even bothered wear mask protect one another. Jesus. MIL almost went fiance's family gathering SC saying going go. fiance said 'only' going 20 people there, flying country, would perfectly safe.

Oh, fiance doctor make will. went store Raleigh. Still least 10% people don’t wear mask zero enforcement. It’s awesome people general wearing holy shit it’s infuriating see successful looking middle aged man line checkout without mask laughing super loudly pregnant lady foot away him, care world. saw something earlier year. study showing how, since like mid 1900's, people become progressively less empathetic. researchers conducting examinations people's reactions list hypothetical situation years years track this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* answer staring us face. drive throughs beed make come back Germany 80 million people covid death rate 107/million. 

Florida less quarter Germany's population Covid death rate 145/million. 

During week fresh outbreak meat factory Germany zero hesitation locking surrounding area. know sooner outbreak contained sooner reopening happen. Good lord unholy amount ellipses  Write script detect ads run it. 100k infections per day unrealistic. isnt enough people Thank God hit plateau begin reopen. hate government sometimes fellow country men women make disappointed handle deal COVID19. president saying people mask political statement fuck anyone feels looks way. long stages incubation/contagious/symptoms? seen many different figures, many estimates state areas highly affected right now. There's doubt infections rising exponentially brazil. 55,000 cases single day absurd number.

There also corruption involved hospitals. Police raided hospital brazil claiming 5000 infected 200 dead. Turns lie almost one hospital, beds absurd number even brazil. live northern arizona April fiance bedridden week diarrhea, fever, shortness breath, fatigue, chest pain. called hospital see specific precautions take advice really give us information phone besides required masks upon arrival. exact symptoms covid worried could hardly get drink chicken broth get sort nutrients.

He finally caved let bring er got tested NOTHING, instead received shame nurse doctor ""likely stomach bug"". sick like since high school 15 years ago.

Arizona handling like shit. I'll get downvoted sure trying stop pandemic like New Zealand impossible United States. way big spread many people can't/won't listen. 

It's like trying put house fire vs camp fire. bucket water threw building slowed bit still coming back strong people go back states go crowded areas? Obviously won’t wear masks social distance nothing logical regarding thinking. Here's brain actually work:

There's deadly virus spreading respiratory droplets

Masks help slow spread disease caused respiratory droplets

I wear mask whenever chance spread best ability. long incubation/presymptomatic time virus, I'd imagine it'd found eliminated developed symptoms. healthy immune system enough B cells. think problem buried point way end, read whole thing makes sound like one rubes bought ""protest spike"" narrative (hell, talked handful sub).

We fucked. Good thing POTUS banned flights Brazil weeks ago. Unpopular view. Well unpopular fact. better worse, ignorance seeing mostly working out. nearly deadly young healthy assumed might be, well... people stupid basically okay chance Portable AC *listen dysfunction dong... massive way... best erections. strongest. Tremendous really, people say ""wow great?"" really nobody knows dicks do* eat finger food buffet passengers rustled unwashed hands cos they're fucking lazy 

1) wash hands
2) use tongs serving implements It’s like decided play Russian roulette obviously lost. Illinois great still. ""Covid Act Now"" model seems Illinois ""green"" model enough contract tracers size population.

We're pumping 20,000-30,000 tests per day 7-day trend 2.7% daily positives. Stupidity knows partylines race. downvoted truth guess. think staying 6 ft away works 

I think really works. zero percentage chance increasing risk. Cloth masks something greater zero. never said anything sort. right, one study approved use US? think reason, US, deaths right now? must shut everything 0.00032 0.0016 percent people 50 die disease. 0.14 percent people 50 65. getting started? Really?

:/ saying worst (Mainstream media full shit, know)

Please share source knowledge sir. country getting record high cases every day, people around getting careless. share them, maybe listen cautious. nod, hear soft mumble can’t understand can’t read face slightly older article still pertinent. steep cost human lives, Sweden least save economy? Nope. Central Bank projects GDP downturn 10 percent, rate European counterparts.

That [a lot indicators show Sweden bad worse Nordic neighbors economically immunity strategy worst worlds: high death / disability burden *and* bad worse economic outcome *and* treated ""Europe's leper colony"". live Whatcom county, we're starting see upticks rural parts around here... masks almost nonexistent lynden, ferndale, etc 🤢 Chinas number fake definitely way higher know. i'm going rag protesters. think protests risky they're outdoor gatherings demographics likely wear facemasks. 👍 foot doctor call case unrelated dog walk ... it’s pleasant. want see real rebel fighters, read comments YouTube video regarding mandatory face masks enjoy.

I live FL. Scrolling comment section FB whenever local news posts something related. Mah god. hard stay positive. know 3 weeks ago. good. That's quite possible. mid life crisis 2015 basically caused mess. wait 2 years that, Jon? terrific country. wife got legally married Christchurch cool country wonderful people. Still doubt become new No.1? Denmark thing New Zealand. Shut borders imposed lockdown early essentially able eradicate virus. don’t need masks essentially everyone healthy. 

Places like US way beyond point. April 3rd alone, 34,864 new confirmed cases US. Actual number even higher testing ramp yet.

If people wore masks, cases could prevented. known effectiveness masks back 1918, virus transmitted aerosols droplets since least January 2020. problem NY, contact tracers forbidden asking attended protests well yes no. depends look it.

Im mind said prevent another TP hoarding situation preserve limited amounts front like health care workers....and get - limited health care staff, limited PPE. health care workers die = less health care workers = enough people treat sick. Therefore regular citizen take backseat.

Meanwhile stated mask use necessary “risk low”, guess could say everybody staying home, much country low numbers anyway. depends interpreted that, saw many wearing masks....

me? wasnt dumb said it. healthcare workers needed masks bet ass going need too....and never left house without one, spite “low risk” talk.

I dont think easy answer, considering problem: bullshitted little sense keep regular people panicking depriving health care workers need take care us. That’s works leaders states cities looking data phased reopenings requiring masks. data shows masks effective preventing transmission. everyone wore mask return ""normal"" effective vaccine comes out. biggest hurdle wearing mask Trump whose narcissism fueled chaos. advocate wearing masks even said wearing mask shows him. crisis made significantly worse people's ignorance. Open borders ppl giving 0 fu ks month..

Now panic mode hopefuly subside Ground Zero seems moving. First China East Asia South Europe North/East USA, Central Northern Europe &amp; UK &amp; Russia South America &amp; South Asia.

Not much going China &amp; East Asia, Europe anymore. East Cost USA also dampered lot. time Facebook redeem shut down. fox news/russian troll echo chamber point.  would call equivalency ""Ummm no. Wearing mask actually make sick. meant breathe CO2, trapped mask. Also germs supposed able get away get stuck inside mask going make sick.""

&amp;#x200B;

An argument I've heard put forth once. acting like straight bully. Guy enough swears back suddenly take high road ""reported.."" lmaoo police station? sabotage. Family memberS!!! Multiple! Someone known unplugging. didn’t didn’t question themselves? fucking hospital! hear you. Thanks clarifying. I’ve seen mostly hotels father still suffering shortness breath, sick almost 4 months ago now. Crazy illness :( irrelevant issue. Air conditioning fans huge deal viral pandemic. follow law. Making employees redo unemployment furlough stuff going suck Kid Rock Joe Exotic separated birth, change mind Recommendations based science tend change get information, specific circumstance (like shortage masks) changes. That’s science works. good advice, period. lose little faith humanity every time read comments attached articles. perspective:

Simply obesity steals average time life unfortunate enough one .5 percent Covid-19 actually kills.

Or 

Covid-19 steals fewer living days Americans motor vehicle accidents, pursued herd immunity got 2 years, would still steal fewer living days American lives motor vehicle accidents two years alone. risk willing assume even trivial benefits, like going get ice cream. Don’t mean-hearted. see Michigan fighting virus issue minimally competent. Combine China centralized (to avoid banned words), get can't acknowledge they're better fractured dual track government full anti-science influences. see eyes government transparency beats covid. can't abide rules, can't apple. person responded confused. wants tell flat earth guys? ""It's people decide precautions want take,"" governor said.

Yikes Thank tourists... cant wait meet one .... Outdoor activities less risky indoor. mean zero risk. 

On top spare covid transmission lose funnel cake deep fried Mars bar related deaths. Covid, stress. Another wrong estimate... posting yesterdays numbers? confuse people. CITY, Philippines — Four towns one component city Cebu province reported one new case coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Saturday, June towns Badian, Carmen, Daanbantayan, Toledo City announced documented one additional COVID-19 patient 7 p.m. Saturday. exist, they've gimped. evidence wide use coronavirus yet? thought one preliminary study. think would call dying stupid.   Yup, sounds right India. Trash. 6 hour newscycle Florida one giant retirement home. millions younger people, young families, working adults. depends live. Hey fellow narcoleptic. think I'd stumble across one sub. 

I'm really worried too. beginning I've felt loss whether treat higher risk not. doc said no, I've seen conflicting info. talked doc? I’m saying is, states everything “right” never able loosen slack long freedom travel. countries able loosen measures cases down. unrestricted travel states invalidates here. Cases, deaths I’m Planet Fitness right Goodyear, AZ. hadn’t heard proclamation nobody outside employees wearing masks. do. 

Source: Florida.

I still see people wearing face masks grocery store going eat restaurants like nothing happened. Well I’m surprised. mother law recently moved FL NY. wearing mask local grocery store idiots actually gave shit wearing it. can’t imagine insecure beliefs I’d harass someone wearing piece cloth mouth. Pffft. expert. We’ve ignoring science since loooong pandemic in!

And we’ll keep coronavirus done killing million claim find ways face billions climate induced collapse deaths right heels. No! That's impossible! sure gender, dress, wrap around head several times. proteins created body's immune system. usually become present 1-2 weeks infection. basically testing body created weapons specific antigen. 

Generally speaking, immune system works things check for. Vaccines used give mild exposure viruses, let's body's natural defenses create weapons fight virus. future, viral load antigen fought against. 

Scientifically speaking, there's guarantee presence anti-bodies means immune virus now...

HOWEVER, positive results leaning towards fact people experience second infection covid 19. 

But..viruses also mutate rather quickly, create different strain virus. create new flu vaccine every year, influenza virus mutates, potential deadlier next year. Sunny Isles basically Russian real estate agents pregnant Russian housewives kinda wild. problem aren’t able manage patients exponential doubling rate, unknown long term side effects disease, poor public knowledge/concern/compliance. countries best preventative screening, aggressive tracking, social compliance prevent spread. protect workers don’t go work sick. best would keep rates low possible vaccine help build herd immunity. (IMHO) Especially lot people stopped wearing masks social distancing... Cite empirical evidence cloth masks work. laughable. claim scientist jumped completely unverifiable conclusion cloth rags. insights? trust state numbers?

Thanks stay safe bud **［June 20th OUTBREAK ALERT］** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

🇺🇸 Florida : +4,049 new cases (spike +3,822 new cases yesterday)

Other countries, states, territories entities like **Portugal / Spain / Puerto Rico / Italy / Singapore / Guam** recorded jump new cases today compared yesterday.

Source : Germany calling. people apartment immediate neighbors originally Bangalore, language skills good.

However, super-smart people. works AI research Amazon working home least 3 months. doctor wife. wife helping paperwork such, ask help, they've got masks gloves them.

You really mind helping people like that, they're smart it.  go volunteer get injected covid support science. let minors it? friends losers Oh mean scientific polls Hillary winning landslide...got expect people agree say stuff like this? Like end goal here? I'm Michigan, seen anything phone contact tracing. didn’t follow sarcasm rules :).  Add /s Increased testing would reveal cases, account higher hospitalizations deaths.

If Florida truly testing widely, 12.36% positive rate scare living shit anyone lives there. Positive rate nowhere near high. Either state government lying snot testing serious trouble. CoNSTITutiOnAl righT GET hAiR doNe! Haven’t governors using percent positive show well doing? Yes, ironically trial needs area cases increasing, see effectiveness. understanding initial results look good, possibility early approval vulnerable people. Yeah we're pretending dont effect spread. Get word out... smh Holland, MI, seems like people Meijer wearing masks. visited Meijer 20 minutes east basically body was.

What strange phenomenon It’s hard think single county consistently wrong everything Orange County  Despite utter lack evidence connecting covid food consumption, China went with. America. sarcasm Lack testing. 

And huge thing doctor suggested trialing cure there. became huge race issue dropped far know. 

With countries really able handle one really spare resources. bread looks good. wish knew put effort learning bake. dont know I’ll make either. move get inpatient treatment became untenable. I’d graduated college worst time. Therapy zoom sucks better nothing. need friend, pm me. I'm around I've always been. Sweden haters tendency actually read write. 

I think deserves another adjective. ""valid optimal"" exactly situation. Another adjective would take away fact valid, would counterproductive discussion.

By way, I'm glad see starting come around fact Sweden's main mistake late reaction, strategy itself. would also help pay doctors salaries Whitmer knew dams failing federal regulators pulled dams license took office 2018. power hungry tyrant didn’t invoke all-encompassing authority order owners repair lower water levels - i’ll tell why, office overly concerned habitat fresh water mussels would negatively impacted. shoulders Right. NZ stuck border controls. contain things enough open back up, allow free travel areas virus raging, shut right back again. That’s whole state-by-state thing makes sense me. Every state safe open irresponsible state is, long free travel. hospitals overrun? HamSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Someone plan? 4K daily cases world meter says entire country 700? last time money didn’t proper army. British came took away Good points appreciate them. essentially plan had. go phase 1 phase 2 ridiculously fast. Maybe slowed plan might actually worked. south Florida right drove beach everything open, bars packed one wearing masks. Vegas local here. Starting hear positive cases resort employees week. like people risking health entertainment stay away sports. I'll continue avoid shallow pop-psychology bullshit like red, green, black pills, thanks least asking interesting question. honestly think things would need get extremely bad another lockdown. first one lot pushback, second one would enormous pushback.

We also seem know bit months ago, may able mitigate without completely locking down. true. Michigan health department said contact tracing plan, now, rely mostly dogged investigations phone calls alert people may infected coronavirus, high-tech apps seem talking Google's ""COVID-19 Exposure Notifications System"" explicitly state ""To use system, need download public health authority's app"". Michigan app can't use it. Lots medications work different ways repurposed. Take Ivermectin example-- used anti-parasitic, also know blocks nuclear transporter many viruses use. many studies currently trying see ivermectin works COVID. Hopefully helps put bit fake news bed .... along many recent studies saying same..... even Zinc. believe virus US March, believe community spread started Americans started become seriously aware COVID weird.

The screeching ""if worried, take steps protect yourself, force everyone to!""

Then followed looks disdain protect yourself. friends family think it’s flu. I’m seeing father Father’s Day missing brothers 21st birthday this. missed fathers birthday March also Easter earlier started. everyone wore damn mask could continue living semi normal lives. ignorance perhaps even willful ignorance, sky rocketing cases. wished people cared one another.  Alright... it... Micks own. Enjoy taste British boot leather... K, guaranteed worse COVID. Soros pays germs spread. /tinfoil post gives hope. friends could get clean towel shirt from? That's would situation. also washer dryer home. I'm actually laundromat right lol. struggle real. Best luck Tell Wirecard people that. Dude big difference especially protests hand masks hand sanitizer. 

If walk arena evening mask, bet get turned away scary Michigan while, especially Wayne County. glad Governor took swift action did. worry state travel people Michigan give summer gather thinking over. connected Newark saw industrial area NJ turnpike assumed that's entire state. Everyone except FL gov clearly.. Florida still checkpoint northern border (I think) let NY. epicenter now. Latino what's looking like hot zone. I'm wondering starting end June- phase 3 trials dependent certain number people getting sick (the hope placebo group), potentially speed phase 3 getting timing right local outbreak. far treatments cures. regimen right living better bed ridden quite back capable working lot daily things. 

H1N1 found major catalyst narcolepsy, sincere hope America's unintentional herd immunity experiment result thousands people developing disorder. would wish nobody. 

Best wishes well. Man I’m going map post. Take people made map government New York, me. nothing good, ever done anyone himself. It’s ant-malarial, kills malaria parasite. anti-viral There's money made. player/staff salaries get paid owners want make profit.

Also Tennessee. state needs roll back Phase 1. means theme parks, gyms, bars, etc, need close again. Restaurants back curbside pick-up. Disney obviously needs delay reopening (they want open weeks, laughable). 

Roll back everything Phase 1 reassess numbers mid-July. quickly getting control. Oh yeah, guess shold say team sports. Golf covid trouble way team sport gonna season year!

I guess next big test NBA bubble Florida. probably would whole lot better state blowing corona right though! think lot people going keep kids home. I'm Western NY, hospitalizations new cases gone since started reopening here. course we're slow people wear masks stores around here. actual fuck, dude. Hoping sense taste comes back, too! That's rough, least make it. &lt;3 ....and here's change. Thanks business us. system designed screw us over, take advantage system time world looked America leaders free world. like across pond cant actually believe seeing hearing. dont wish insult American response Covid beyond basic common sense. Trumpet holding party team Covid turn like lot lemmings? USA voted him? truelly concerned Americans, need switch everything count 10 switch new political system actually works, ban guns understand money everything. full article: Arizona. Brevard county, ~1hr East you:

Nobody's wearing masks probably month. I'm usually 1 maybe 3-5 folks wearing one.

Nobody fast food place wearing them, people Lowe's wear around necks put talking near customers remove talking other. may small pattern emerging here... RIP live Arizona far part Canada 0 cases linked protests, everyone also wearing masks might effect see. benefit living government believe actively killing people. reason rock boat try make change good people (under belief system), could threat wealth. Right? 

For it’s worth, I’m saying correct thinking government actively killing people. I’m shedding light seems thought process: complacency despite apparently believing government actively killing people.
I wonder part complacency due deep belief virus isn’t serious say. Like subconscious belief aren’t aware of. 

I mean...How else could justify lack action face passive government murder aside deep belief it’s bad - or, afraid lose wealth? India nuclear disasters unlike Japan, America, Russia. 

Unrelated, except possibly nuclear power plants could provide times pandemic, find ""air conditioned"" ICU unfortunately huge ass country already reeling pandemic.

His seems like sort poor justification low quality India deaths equivalent USA, 

Not yet. Time heard stuffing dead bodies refrigerated trucks Newyork.

Happened, outlier. 


Here real ICU beds US. us educated worry India. Young population help, crowded conditions inadequate medical care recipe disaster. 

Currently per capita deaths India extremely low. Brazil similar situation 6 weeks ago. Things change quickly India seems currently heading direction.

I hope wrong. I’m Fl neighbors literally don’t think it’s real. Meanwhile gf self isolated one rooms bc tested positive. It’s fucking sad really, ignorance hicks. don’t believe anything unless fat fuck Trump tells to. Simplified: 2 people app Bluetooth activated share keys. one gets tested positive enter app key get broadcast phones (keys tied individual). key list met infected person shown higher risk. based german app, since know one best. Umphta--thats real shit there, Jack. Somewhere, prolly multiple somewheres, charts graphs presentations demonstrating commercial value reopening inclusive increased deaths. 

I dont think state governments together enough it, dont think amazon nike sort analysis together forwarded lobbyists? Floridian, say large majority population either selfish ignorant ever accept wearing masks. privilege hard work immediately, coronavirus exists fringe there. wait couple weeks think distinction Europe America even stark. don’t think Americans realize badly fucked see Europeans live sports back American sports still can’t make move restart. It’s interactions people r/climateskeptics really got head. lost much tax revenue. Can’t sustain unemployment funds forever. Restaurants stores verge collapse. New Jersey alone stated 30% drop tax revenue yr. know, Germany working containing outbreak. 1000 recent cases originated one slaughterhouse. workers there, families people contact getting tested quarantine. hopefully start upward trend, short time spike. 

And either way considering size Germany even current numbers quite low. lot countries world much new cases every day per 1 million inhabitants Germany moment. look example two countries overall cases far. USA Brazil ten thousands new cases day Brazil 2.5 times USA 4 times inhabitants Germany.

Overall countries Europe far worst numbers weeks ago. least something. least better currently new record numbers. It’s what? mayor Texas city pass mandate there? Scary shit Nova Scotia we’ve new cases 11 days allowed group 10 people together two days ago. come outside province STILL quarantine 14 days Sweden’s PM didn’t suggest injecting disinfectant sponsor drug hydroxychloroquine majority doctors agree doesn’t treat covid. hubby big favor look anti-inflammatory foods. had/have lung flare ups too, diet really helped control it. processed carbs sugars- really stick clean diet lots greens, berries, chicken fish instead red meat. Fatty acids good, doesn’t like fish, fish oil supps. anti-inflammatory food stuff. Right you.  I'm 49, ""random respiratory virus"" like 2 months starting early February. Mild enough deal with, bad enough suck. Walking flight stairs like running 3 miles. 
By May, symptoms really bad finally tests area.  
Came back negative, doctor absolutely convinced false negative. 
I much better, still require 2 hour nap 5 hours work. feel like worldwide problem. far article itself, many economic measures simply GDP. amount time recover, employment, consumer confidence, housing prices, etc factor in, info won’t comparable pandemic over. work business contracts tell language showing frequently now. defending it, pointing lawyers moved quickly include standard contractual language. concerts, sporting events, amusement parks, etc. resume expect see fine print. android need download app facilitates contact tracing. Google built apis OS level make work 3rd party app, downloaded.

Misleading article least Android perspective  excited summer end school restart people get annoying. Saw Facebook woman looking chair daughters dorm room. People commenting chair people sit abiding social distancing. people miserable could probably paint masks blend paint everywhere else. Generally country treated covid properly handfuls people disregarding lockdown rules. Even BLM protests recently keeping social distancing. Still room improvement could lot worse considering idiots charge. Yay, Florida office reopening Monday. Mandatory everyone. Sigh. must something water BNO News, missed tweets ""free"" country, bad free limited lot things like idiocy. That's part certainly, also states got smashed first. -03/05: 100.000 confirmed cases Brazil

Tampa bay times Miami herald reported found evidence reporting deaths data scientist gets fired claims fudging numbers. went make website similar state's site, numbers differ DOH. That's 3 independent sources claim thing. know data using shape opinion usually try find politician's press conference source forming opinion. gut tells enough question official stats. India

Superpower

2020

poo loo I'll take it. I've never particularly strong social sciences, ""natural science"" take book appealed me, obviously makes lot big assumptions lead significant leaps. told friend reading book author would say lot things seemed based evidence make sense, draw wild conclusions. better, similar books written lay level? virus hasn’t become less deadly, it’s lot frail already died aka 40% American deaths attributed assisted living residents, leaves resilient patients contracting virus today. least that’s speculation. cool, never think flying body injuring someone else too. seem think I’m arguing something I’m not. totally opposed lifting lockdown economic reasons agree contact tracing vital.

However let’s face facts — Florida million miles away unlikely ever able take on. countries it, even New Zealand struggling again. thought source feel lol I'm Latino jus curious actual data that, and. hope latino/latina using latinx bullshit country many cases day lax Brazil. numbers lie friend. People use bad news football honestly think could good news load horseshit. latest evidence points long-term immunity full recovery majority cases. Also, impact ""every major system body"". affects, primarily, people's lungs secondary effects cardiovascular system leads complications minority cases. systems affected way common viruses affect them. find minority cases things like neurological disease, mean that's unique aspect COVID-19. Many viruses cause upper respiratory infections, including pneuomonia, mono, plethora others lead systems failing minority cases.  


COVID-19 bad, hysteria sub gets ridiculous. Shocker believe it. 

Of course believe it. conspiracy nutter posts r\_conspiracy similar subreddits time. Plus big treating medical illness pressure points like Chiropractor--- that's basically fake medicine. LOL. true. reckon retirement communities outbreaks much bigger impact surrounding younger population. neither California's. political reasons never see California Newsome get bashed. Los Angeles major Epicenter right now. Corona proving care politics mask wearing. It’s bizarre... even friends aren’t otherwise radical conspiracy theorists spectacularly dumb occasionally share anti-mask articles hate Whitmer. MI seen lot weird hoax propaganda reason. literally described coronavirus data scientist. actual headline article click link. yet Oklahoma’s testing LESS still seeing big increase cases.

And anyone passing through, quote article’s author, it’s quote FL governor. article includes context validate statement true. get know Ft. Pierce Lake Okeechobee regions. Inbreeding optional. Thanks info! right, feels like everyone forgotten already Good luck! hope works out! wonder know racist sound. ""orential culture submissive disciplined"", ""hive mind"".

What bullshit. Get american exceptionalism, nothing inevitable America's refusal wear masks. happen let science become object partisanship. one party activaly say global warming evolution liberal conspiracies, refusing listen advice scientific authorities logical next step. really, although that's part problem. government also big portion problem.

Just remember New Zealand island smaller California. playing game easy mode. great see worked them. 

Also usually virus mutates infectious less deadly is. 

We need take wildfire approach. Shut areas start flair up. need shutting Wyoming Florida flaring again. Florida needs shutting back asap til get things back control. New Yorker (admittedly live hard hit areas) feels weird seeing New York green zone. part illinois? I’m curious mood throughout state. I’m Kane. Exactly. suggest Giesecke Tegnell like Boris. Lead example herd immunity strategy go hospitals shake hand infected. 

BTW: Swedish critized Swedish strategy since they/we brought home Swedish citizens Wuhan (february 2) without quarantine them. Thanks. whatever reason didn’t quite process morning. It’s amazing cup coffee four do. Look people currently leading countries. Well, argumentation opposite. Laschet arguing kinds shops opening again, church service to. forbidden, took one week open start small catastrophe. What's absolute travesty people think government officials saying ok open actually feel good time reopen. don't. know worst time reopen. know statistics, they're talking doctors scientists. 

They care.


Simple truth, one people care death, health. 

You care. Let reopen everything pretend like nothing except essentials still open might make this. FL logic. Eagerly awaiting 300 IQ posters coming tell us plan along I’ve got great news Expect use masks, enforcement mask orders, oscillate.  case counts low falling, stuff news, people decide wear masks.  case numbers high rising, news full covid, people wear masks. 

The bad part is, eradicate virus get near-universal vaccination. Whenever get close eradication, mask usage fall, virus epidemic resurge. see daily basis. can't put words much anymore, ""possession"" them. rather they're consumed US idealism, capitalism, etc. point close death thing sobers them. could guessed would happen? everyone, thanks morons there!   Lol irony. He’s ginger 😂 blame you, pornsites making us confused days. Fauci says Americans ignoring science ~~amid coronavirus pandemic~~

Headline three words long. 
^(/disgusted American)  Racism? fucking pig? Yea, regional seems. live Ann Arbor area people good inside here. areas like pandemic. likely see shift outbreaks areas. Many people need eye implant. consider contribute. think coloring book analogy apt. 

If walk away book saying “global exchange way prevent one people dominating another combination technology immunology,” you’ve gotten something it. Trump nothing it.. thats china.. handling fine.. stop trying talk shit cause hater. “bro,” far unemployed cannot provide families. *Many* dying didn’t get proper medical/diagnostic care conditions would caught properly treated overreacted. estimated 150,000 550,000+ deaths worldwide swine flu first year, world reacted nothing like this... Asking poll protest question get answer looking especially since can't disagree BLM else. consistently seen across globe early strict lockdowns combined contact tracing able successfully contain virus. also seen across globe failure lockdown leads virus spreading control.

This complicated. Meh, disagree. Even conservative parents admit good job (even mom still makes quips “such open still can’t get hair done” smh). It’s really small selection idiot Trump-lovers hate her. like anti PC people start criticizing people using PC terms, inadvertently making form political correctness. matter fact, practise social distance period Black Death.  That's it? there’s legitimate reason can’t wear mask fine. 

Anything else completely disagree. 5,000 deaths globally yesterday. 

I get isn’t Black Plague shit serious. 

If wearing mask much know helps protect user, others, prevent spread don’t know else say. 

People need Wear fucking mask. Get it. ruin economy more? Prolonged uncertainty unknown future businesses neutered accomplish widespread mask usage high risk aspects economy either adapting business model closing spread contained?

There win economy situation. state income tax kind. corporations. Tried argument well. Apparently “those tacky” “she really wants party” 😶

I think get people respect let know it’s bad idea also reflects poorly throw party right would putting guests uncomfortable place even aren’t worried. Fingers crossed Bad math never convincing someone understands math. people trust experts - often use expertise simply lie, another expert disagree them, trust? Atheist raised catholic. Unimaginable guilt comes catholic. DeSantis: “IT’S WORKING SAY WORKING.” testing Oxford vaccine starting? putting data together state run website could save lives fucking scientist does? could Belgium already hit really hard disease slowing accord. we've seen US states previously impacted months back seeing huge accelerations businesses re-open. Btw, ended lockdown Belgium? allowed step retail shops? Dine restaurants? Oh whole bunch rallies planned next weeks. Tulsa distant memory. That's works, certain mutations affect effectiveness vaccine AFAIK virus yet. mutations actually change anything relevant. see willing approve someone else’s results. hope would, don’t, get it, qualms running trials, hate delay.

I believe already signed deal distribute one. think trump ordered hundred million doses deaths teens went 15 20 headline calls ""spike largest number almost 3 weeks"". single digit increase spike largest number. Lol think both. Realistically? voting majority one degree separation someone affected seriously  Honestly usually say this...

But unplug something.. hospital specially next patient... specially next machines think something happens...

 


How people like even make adulthood even survive. economy! /s   Depends you’re looking heard tried get one corona sniffing dogs check venue said “fook no!” Knowing Trump; he’ll probably sue Oklahoma allowing happen. Cut funding letting people get COVID alternative herd immunity? will. Unless government tells no. Nice know, considering live MI. Strongly agree. State enforcement focus financially punishing business enforce mask wearing. That's effective way enforce citizens requires many fewer resources trying enforce directly. police even participate. I'm big college sports fan care bunch B1G agree wholeheartedly sentiment fuck Ohio, especially Ohio State. I've read stories US doctors reporting patients complaining virus fake, doctors trying prevent organfailures. They'll buried MAGA hat, there's way back some. mean, go back old 2010-ish videos Youtube, many aged like fine wine. narrative? less likely catch outdoors assuming keep distance? That’s truth. aware studies US looking HCQ prophylactic, guess throwaway-person talking treatment. won’t. going shut cases. matters lockdown hospitalization deaths rental, family owns lake house. live Michigan unintelligent woman gas station yesterday coughing lung, scratchy voice trouble breathing. mask, says ""Don't worry COVID, promise!""

I hard stared furrowed brow transaction done. would let know idiotic being, want chimp touch me. folks immunocomprimised live them, I've bite tongue many times since shit started.

 I'm tired blatantly stupid ideas becoming mainstream. Yeah were. I’m riverside got home errands actually skipped stop large compact amount people masks on. Wasn’t worth get wanted moved on. That's what's happening Arizona. Yeah, state opened soon, everyone surrounding states coming go clubbing party boats we're open they're I'm fully aware risks, chose take them. 

Anyone knowledge risk, stay away . 

Anyone comfortable risks, stay home. 

What wrong lime thinking. Indoors vs outdoors.
Masks vs masks.

If *don't see difference*, might dumb. protest outdoors marching climate controlled packed arena ~6 hours? honestly don’t see difference? Democratichoaxapalooza Temp checks useless. Take something headache knocks temperature right I’d rather call temporary normal, maybe that’s me. also could never vaccine. North Macedonia. states regress cases one takes seriously Thornton/Westminster. politics allowed r/coronavirus 

So nothing see here. isn’t happening.  Putting data website actual scientific work?

You really think chick puts data website deserves respect PhD chemistry?

Anyways, don’t tell three people maintains company websites data scientists. might ask raise! stupid tell. That's con works. Ye done exactly described happened India... scenario. Definitely trying defend Brazilian government actions since fact bunch Trump-like sociopaths highlight devastating virus countries Brazil India. can’t even follow saying. like flu. Italy, 15% people got died. lost 200,000 people far. Masks encourage people go out. It’s pretty easy modify mask n95 help protect others. think would worse economy: losing million two consumers forever rough year? Consumers key. government businesses kind. Losing many consumers would devastating cause long term depression. Banks looking economy v w. recover. wearing mask public part jobs end this? probably one people wears mask driving... went Harvard Yale. Navy seal. say like DeSantis's politics, listen talk take two seconds realize he's highly intelligent. guys read comments here, yo”” find I’m arguing *for* extended lockdown stringent measures.

Jesus Christ. One first pictures guy 3 week old baby. Horrible. know everybody rally might get infected - except one person... ""The less tests do, less cases have"" -Donald J. Trump 

And Trump says, ""The virus *fading away.""* ...just like re-election chances. 

 Trump followers, forget sign waiver! agree. NYC/Long Island counted today every 1 person wearing mask 4-5 people wearing one. mention parking lots filled tables chairs packed people social distancing. hope wrong could turn bad NYers couple weeks. People forget 700 people dying per day month ago. made day. double ivy friend double ivy doctor husband aren’t wearing masks enforcing kids “we don’t it.” Hopefully minority Ann Arbor. pretty shocked Thank delaying. equipped handle surge. 80-90?? damn I'm kinda jealous lmao. live conservative area fair, id put mask numbers around 50% restrictions lifting tl;dr: Top Arizona health official moron understanding health science. businesses open full capacity? transit full capacity? large public events, like concerts sports. businesses open protective measures place. 

Also, worth noting new case numbers pretty low since early May, risk much lower places like US

Point masks one factor spread virus. ...They ""plan""? Pretty sure pretended virus hoax moved along normal. Ironic. neighboring states new infections New York still relaxed restrictions placed New Yorkers. 🤦‍♀️ Yes, narrative science. I’ll keep believing that. Besides high possibility many eventually catching COVID anyway. may well keep going outside, getting vitamin D, exercising right? days sarcasm obvious unfortunately long gone. off-topic comments allowed here? map makes Mimal look kinda like Winnie-the-Pooh (ignoring Minnesota). Philly we’ve ton protests weeks pretty large crowds, corona cases still steadily falling. honestly surprised. people rallies wearing masks maybe actually helping? fine, there's plenty space social distance. made 600 mile round trip Michigan week issues rest areas stopped at. lack clear guidance regarding slow spread disease keep economy open long possible single biggest failure US federal government whole crisis. one failure result huge number unnecessary deaths massive economic devastation near future scale make previous several months look like vacation. insist eat restaurant patio outdoor seating! Call restaurant make sure space tables 6 feet apart. ask servers wear face shields. Personally, would bring disposable plastic tablewear order bottled water/beer (just like Mexico Jamaica). importantly, use restroom. Research Diamond Princess ship outbreak Japan found bathrooms staterooms highest level virus particles! likely flushing toilets aerosolize particles contaminate everything small space. never argument — strongly arguing lockdown contact tracing. See comments. \*\*ck yeah! done Mid-March, we'd great position today. Hopefully three months, changes help us threat level virus massively reduced. Florida man don’t care slightly nuance comment: say 'on meat industry'. every industry makes use ""imported"" labor forces, people victims conditions forced onto them.
Yes, slaughterhouses example, there's many examples happening.  Im talking 100% capacity arenas always work mask visit Nebraska anyways. Hamsters given vaccine infected vaccine worked. Less tourists maybe? It’s easy say easy aren’t selfish person. Many sacrifices made part keep family safe. Going disgusting crowded pool like pictured middle pandemic definition sacrifice. Depends profession chose college. called idiots could well scientists painting idiots change fact.

All I'm saying shes actual scientific work real life pandemic stats state Floridas health department, downplaying trying compare complete different field insane. Think whatever want end day, Data scientists deserve respect scientists.  see someonw coughing, run person make him/her ""Well least Gramps got see Trump died"" Well, shitty, usually Hawaii layovers lasting day times month. Protesting took place outdoors, lessens risk transmission, protestors wore masks. Nonetheless, acknowledged risk. 

Trump egofest takes place indoors, likely little mask usage, attendees think covid hoax. 

Different things different. I’m staying one. Made sure get one whole place wiped services arrived. Oxford vaccine successful, copy moment ready distribute it. Thats Grate Leedur Little Automaton Grate Leedur told say. saying it. top article says it’s nearly contained MI. That's fucked up. understand people like that. case people even leave house come here. People 40 scared all. bars packed. bars packed, huge ""speakeasy"" house parties going virtually every neighborhood. Reddit non-representative sample. Sorry assumed lockdown/mask/distance sycophant questioned qualifications reddit comment. /r/Coronavirus describes people here. case you? apologize.

Deaths going many areas, including areas reopening. evidence people getting immunity. Nearly everyone makes antibodies struggle see ""beyond pale"" ask evidence support drastic changes society happening. doesn’t matter you’re ruminating doom gloom, depending area could reality regardless want. don’t think denial valid coping strategy, think change expectations goals fit situation that’s actually real. lot growth developing countries probably fewer BLM protestors Maybe shit load states follow proper reopening guidelines? That's great. Despite that, *don't get complacent*. Keep wearing mask. amount people Alabama wear masks ""it's going away"" damn many. state shut state travel red. pretty sure state people stay quarantine period. Totally agree there.

I favor stopping economy, jailing people home.

But also promote use masks social distancing possible. China didn’t contain virus. That’s got around world.  Also John Oliver  potentially spreading disease wearing fucking mask It’s actually bet government won’t allow lawsuits related lack reasonable precautions connection COVID.

In end, suspect won’t allowed - least decades - they’d simply bankrupt many companies. acted prudently prevent unnecessary loss life - question didn’t. We’re sitting one moments future people shocked accepted inhumanity (when 1/3 us raged favor it). according MLive, yesterday, Michigan *second day row* 200 new cases... doubled days before. as-if places baking numbers bit much, they're reporting different sources. OOP tutorials. uses OOP anymore?? How? What? parroting things hear? guess trend map.
So NY still better others terms less ratios previous weeks positive trend.
All highly misleading Corona 10% science 90% politics. science also 90% politics. We're left 1% actual science 99% bullshit. worried innocent people fucks infect making choice follow guidelines.

These people don’t deserve sympathy. know precautions need take, choose willfully ignore massive amount info available them. Fuck ‘em.

As someone immunocompromised, whole anti-mask pretend pandemic never happened/is get sick die meant mentality driving fucking crazy.

Sorry, trying sound super mad anything, want end everyone safe healthy too, feel long ways that. Maybe day realize nearly smart think are. 

Your opinion worthless. think bit stretch say we're failed state. Somalia failed state. can't expect people stay cooped months. like strict (too strict) diet exercise plan – people hit wall.

If authorities want slow spread virus, point need find ways, ways people manage realistically.

If want keep people getting all, good luck that. contagious actually stop completely, keeping people shut there's vaccine pretty much impossible. buy drugs you? Show football stadium doesn’t mostly indoor concourse, public bathrooms long try spread bleachers bit wear masks, cap 1/2 stadium size, think it’s great idea. players comfortable it. Soccer would probably better smaller team size baseball would best minimal contact. Less 2 months classes begin public schools, people gotta get vacations in. think sticking Man

They know sticking themselves, families, workers stores resturants eventually medical workers emts janitors clean hosptial rooms struggle survive.

some people would rather believe authority figure without science knowledge says act normal feels good rather deal inconvient truths scientissts around world say wear mask, distance, wash freaking hands, put lid flush toilet etc.

they rebels good cause, mobile disease vectors. Florida salutes service. Except Trump campaign literally handing masks hand sanitizer anyone wants it.

But keep spreading misinformation. Politics taken sub There’s third option, really applies parties: dickhead. That's honestly even dumbest idea I've heard today could someone knowledge viral transmission please explain differences new cases UK states reopening?  


both regions currently laxer restrictions ""hard lockdown"" states (MA, NY, MI, NJ, etc.) high numbers cases + deaths per capita (I think UK second highest) avoid comparison places cases begin with, makes sense. UK reports say deaths/cases trending downward, we're seeing explosive rises hospitalizations positive tests states reopened fully. might be? information gave gave enough info google it. stands Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated Streptococcal Infections got positive test results back March 23 I’m STILL suffering hacking cough, chills, breathlessness, strange burning sensation chest. gets worse night.

I don’t want say I’m happy I’m one freaking relieving know I’m going crazy—that it’s head. Thanks clarifying without douchebag. Michigan here. Nothing iphone. get mentality bearing success mentality— find tad easier live thinking I’ll able go back work soon, I’ll able take trip see family UK, favorite restaurant reopen, etc either ruminating doom gloom day taking solace people don’t agree getting sick Looks like old graphic march april. Italy, Iran South Korea arent crazy outbreaks anymore. 80k new 180k come straight Brazil USA alone, 100k split every country. shit everyone talked us Whitmer 🤷🏼‍♂️

But heck that, competition. frustrating hear everyone bash Whit taking charge, bet people salty woman using power, man done really good job this. youve got full face respirator, probably good time hit poker tables.... COVID whales probably poker whales, too. Theyre waiting give money virus. “Bad luck” rubes. right call people Florida stupid can't believe gall say taking seriously compared you. Sorry hear this. high hopes country saw airports handled country vs poorly thought handled beginning. Crowded terminals people wait seemingly reason feed spread. Why? Yeah :( Well what’s really fucked logic, people eventually travel hundreds miles across state find hospital bed fair northern Michigan upper peninsula there's many people begin live year travel much surprising good containment there.  assume 'north' yall saying U.P. understand, cuz us yoopers second class citizens state.

Well well like 12 ppl U.P. 

Easier us social distance numbers small /s live central Illinois. I’ve grocery store twice June. times 90-95% mask wearing. don’t know things downstate limited experience, mask wearing happening here. agree people generally annoyed though. racist.

The mods let get away it. Definitely lots young Russians. couple Airbnb next us Hollywood probably mid-20s. 

However stopping new hard Rock saw Russian Grandma probably 80s wearing full blood red Adidas tracksuit. Adidas shoes sweatband go it. 

it's little scary, comical, expensive Coming Arkansas) place diverse mixing pot. awesome food... obnoxious. telling become illegal resident Chinese dialect. It’s targeting foreign expats’ fears deported still stand smoking regulated is. 

If walked someone started lightly choking them, they'd call cops assaulting them. everyone's basic desire breathe clean air less important someones desire poison via drug? 

Absolutely infuriating, especially person number breathing problems severe allergies cigarettes. Sorry, speak up? can't hear evidence wrong contact tracing centre? contact tracing centre (CTC) place people (who trained) contact people COVID19 subsequently, close contacts provide advice help stop spread virus. web based system used track manage calls.   contact tracing centres located?  number CTCs established across country, Universities, Government Offices Statutory Agencies, including:  Army Camp

 hell wrong people?

A deep case morons. K sta je sa turizmom? Jel essential? Ko zeli zivit u strahu od zaraze od neceg sta ima posljedice koje mozda traju unedogled neki umiru? Alo ? Yeah young people probably okayish... bad health already. comes next? Oh yeah infect vulrable start dying again.

What idiot. police serve enforce this. harass Nestlé. one Monsanto murdered police felt threatened.

We police powerful.

We police communities color.

I'm frustrated. worst ""tested negative twice antibody test negative wtf covid???""

In fairness, tested negative virus also neg antibodies, doctor still believes it. wife hospitalized classic symptoms starting early March peaking mid late March second wave mid April. still lingering symptoms today. 

The tests complicated; tested back March/April might positive, unable get tested late May. virus probably gone body, due odd immune system (I ME/CFS) unlikely made sufficient antibodies show positive result. antibody test gave high specificity, means came back positive almost certainly it, also 50% rate false negative means getting negative essentially tells nothing. best tests simply good enough yet. part michigan. sudden town packed traffic lots people beach. want go home!!! Go back south diseased selves! election orders masks? Florida old af. live regular single-family home area north Miami. Two four neighbors (either side across) died five years I've here. old. bet theres whooole lot covid running around white house! He's honorable man!

/s can't blame NY, douchebag throwing anything seeing sticks. Oh, king US. name MONEY. friends/family Las Vegas stay local/Las Vegas news. hearing quite cases casinos. Also, guest comes hotel, ends sick, casino sends security room, security gets sick, etc. Exactly thoughts, I'm thinking may something Moderna American. see working vaccine becoming political depending country origin unfortunately. Also, I've seen certain people Trumps administration stocks Moderna. However, since moved Johnson &amp; Johnson September July hope Oxford follow similar route. Damn, even Trump bailed treatment long time ago. Now, pretends like want pushing it. Since got sick march, see anyone 2 weeks ago. met friend outside discuss august camping trip, needed put hands maps figure concrete route.

Am gradually opening seeing people long staying safe, know am. Nope. 

Paragraph breaks ever sentence make sound right, make obnoxious. downvoted? absolutely dragging feet. They've approving phases record speed. Phase 2 even received 1st booster yet. I'm right, phase 3 would start shortly 30 day booster, saw issues high dose phase 1. overlapping phases speed up. incredibly early.

And phase 3 completely dependent rates infection, timing uncontrollable. fairly quick, drag out. *some* people Oh follow precautions. Mask distance, question when? goal post you? vaccine never comes? It’s called misogyny. rampant misogyny directed Whitmer. Michigan full misogynists, men women. Yes, nothing without tourism. people survive that. way home(tn) Michigan type this’s difference night day compared tennessee. went meijers yesterday 95% people wearing masks. tennessee, 20-30% people wear masks. Today’s going worse.  want click image, US still around 20-25 thousand new cases every day entire European Union 5 thousand new cases every day. also noted EU's population 100 million US. There’s answer pointing “square one” zero awareness zero precaution.

It’s also zero immunity among easily infected.

The states hit hard long way zero. lifting restrictions carefully, shared awareness among people risks useful countermeasures. still can’t go sit restaurant NYC, knowledge - despite extreme downward trend.

That’s states didn’t get hit first wave partying like it’s getting crushed right (TX, FL, AZ). much political effort put convincing people states NBD, wonder they’ll able accept new restrictions they’ve “gone back normal.” lived orlando tx wearing mask, son? Floridians voted put Trump DeSantis office I’ll leave here: No, dying good everyone. Idiot. Yes, worth remembering. lot things specific Covid-19, happen lot viruses us none us ever worried about.

And cases, exception rather rule. nah come play ICU beds full. ATM transitioning liberal hoax, past 'things going fine' to, 'we need society functioning'. flat line beginning graph flattened curve. Right?! I’ve saying couple months! need mixed COVID. havent popping lately subreddit, swear hydroxychloroquine found dangerous ineffective MONTHS ago. still news. got numbers.
Though seems reporting today, yesterday. Texas already adjusted 700 new cases today.
Looks like figures incorrect. mention know effects virus children. Idk someone would put child risk political rally. Maybe one believe virus. Since COVID-19 trending topic, try take advantage this. hear burzum thing. fact im big frowny face time regarding hellhammer necrobutcher mayhem's views gays. Spoiler: views good, like think gays killed, havent listening mayhem since :( Flu dangerous 50. stop testing number cases go down)); wouldn’t chosen outdoor venue? trying smartass - security issue?? Damn. take roadie next month. mention reduced odds type also lowest risk severe complications. 

To fellow type O's, better blood types, even strong malaria resistance want mess either. mom's dad O+ like parents grandparents, moderate flare ups getting malaria one time.   Colorado ok also Coronavirus tests high specificity means low false positive rate. It’s nature test- swab trying dig around tiny coronavirus particles. don’t find doesn’t mean aren’t there, find it’s pretty rare something else. Meanwhile tests give 20% false negatives even best point. wait long, 60% false negative rate 

Even so, positive corona test corona symptoms negative test, quarantine. worth risk others agree Trump dident anything neither countries neither people either. Shockingly don’t think that’s protestors fault country polices peaceful protestors like they’re terrorist criminals. explains it. Hurry reopen faster slow testing problem solved. Holy shit that’s laughable. need remember PANDEMIC. virus doesn’t care political views rights lmao Ah yes, good ole American competitiveness see who's #1.  work casino AZ, fucking joke right now. Yeap, every time ICU bed headline comes sub goes straight top first upvoted comment always ""who could predicted this"" nonsense. believe Utah sent something like 100-150 doctors medical personnel help NY peak. Hopefully NY able return favor, looks like Utah might need it. finance website reporting this. ""personal finance"". stick know. misleading. much different someone works Publix elderly relative. public health message public, stay hell away grandma. 

The sooner young people get get it, sooner hug grandma without worrying it. mom assisted living facility, I'd feel much better staff already disease recovered. Getting encouraging young people resume lives best way lower overall mortality rate. fine. Lockdowns never going stop virus.

2-3 weeks we'll start see community case decline viable hosts reduced immunity. protect vulnerable we'll muscle this. testing? thought problem? lying me?+ would say technically no. good idea because:

1. sets example others, humans like conform everyone else it.

2. Antibody tests could inaccurate. y’all it. know anything medical science could told dumb idea. got running country?!? ""plan"" seems like generous word agree you. fun, devils advocate, let’s open minded. Maybe we’ll learn something interesting coronavirus this. Maybe won’t play like that. Anything possible. 

Obviously 99% chance thousands people get sick hundreds die. doesn’t happen, least science learned something important us going forward. Let idiots gloat. Well yes, reason think assuming. Wearing masks much case ""either it, we're affected.""
It kill ones it.
That said, Darwin's theories not, we've used popular culture, dumb die off. weak die off. anyone unable survive pandemic fighting virus dying pandemic much line survival fittest philosophy. Also take otc zantac see get relief! let acid reflux go untreated scar esophagus making hard swallow food! get ulcers. ulcer fucking awful. first thing noticed too. poor child - baby, would snuggled safely quietly home, instead, poor kid loud, plagued-up place. 

Just crazy...... going treated single dose, good luck getting funding. least HIV people pay treatment life - that's money is. Pharmaceutical companies going rush trying find round drugs take times make money back.  bad eggs ruin everyone.

Doesn't seem case countries virus control. Outbreaks clusters going continue happen virus burns eradicated. said, people can't respect businesses partial capacity, best keep closed indoor business focus strictly online orders/sales. working well enough before, government make enough money people going beach nature parks.  think want beat NY's records. long tail extends least eight weeks. Also don’t think extent spike. expect spike won’t peak while. They’d every right blame protests. equal blame put rallies know mean it’s really dumb considering happened states. PLZ keep curve flat criticism Trump Covid nothing February mid March. 

He hasn’t done much afterwards either... time period importance when: 1 - developed community spread 2 - stopped able contact trace 3 - rejected testing failed creating own... things happened Feb mid March.

The Chinese ban, policy Trump tried push forward, OK, didn’t go far enough. needed larger scale travel bans several countries already showing epicenters virus. Places like Italy, Iran. I’ll concede Dems partial blame rejecting Chinese Travel ban... Trump favors. Calling virus hoax throughout whole time. Saying virus would go away. 15 cases would go zero. 

The point I’m making Trump didn’t know doing. didn’t understand importance time period. didn’t listen people could helped navigate type event... perhaps fired many prior pandemic. 

If taken action time period, wouldn’t lockdown economy. wait til summer, die heat! pandemics originate lab.

There's evidence suggest did.

I let y'all in, either. “If Trump felt comfortable here, I’m comfortable.”

This real danger. virus isn’t going anywhere without vaccine may take years maybe never. States won’t stay closed unless want city look like Detroit MI Fuck... Ya saw like 2 people wearing masks. Hell, even handed masks event one wore them.

One dude said interview ""I'm worried virus cuz numbers gone significantly."" reporter told numbers going said ""those numbers accurate Facebook."" mind me, I'm commenting thread locked think air movement could carry droplets 6’. Air movement fan, wind, shouting voice even. don’t think droplet survives HVAC air changes. HVAC systems dehumidify filter air. Exactly. Trump's rallies like perfect petri-dish coronavirus 'breed' spread among people. sound like real nice guy. think make way sub. Take care. determined kill cult, Jim Jones netherlands. think virus pretty much ran course EU, given high death count. 

Americans decided one day 'you know what? Masks works! Put goddamn mask!'

Even though doesnt fucking work even said people risk group wear one. Wow, really cited Constitution reason masks mandatory?! pass seat belt law? smoking ban? helmet law? Constitution says government cannot impose rules public health safety? I’ve said times since happened, one point State Officials get held responsible poor decision making? point seen negligence? Let corona games begin! People understand US hospitals businesses, like empty tables restaurant, empty ICU beds make money. huge amount capacity purpose sub general MSM like spinning make sound like COVID patients filling majority ICU beds even remotely close true. hard fill small margin capacity small influx COVID patients. go again. Fuck... Ya saw like 2 people wearing masks. Hell, even handed masks event one wore them.

One dude said interview ""I'm worried virus cuz numbers gone significantly."" reporter told numbers going said ""those numbers accurate Facebook."" wrong think lulls people false sense safety ""insane"" people get sucked cult. im also really sensitive throwing ""crazy"" tag around damaging relationships, abusive tell person crazy normal, although illogical, human responses high stress traumatic events situations. Talk union. Teacher's union strong depending state let know concerns, see get early maternity leave something. There's science supportive public mask use efficacy.

Wear don't. obsession masks like obsession lockdowns. People shown true colors values year. raving weeks Orlando Texas buddy  admit racist.

It saves everyone time. sure. Hope so. least cite idiots talk YES, sending sick infected senior citizens nursing homes equipped handle COVID patients also virus ran course dying down. lack testing critical failure. virus already here. federal govt nothing proactively stop folks American china. may bought time, nothing time... indoors? Wtf. Brazil completely lax, taken many measures, many countries like taken severe lockdown measures.

And lockdown policies mean successfully isolating communities. ex. America. USA mass protests last 2 weeks now, sudden uptick cases, rise infections gradual slow.

Whereas brazil nowhere new cases showed tens thousands. make sense many cases made up. never seen absurd spike daily infection cases anywhere else world. early March (when virus first starting pop off), REALLY hoping things would contained late summer could make annual trip Petoskey Charlevoix. obvious reasons, we’re skipping year, fingers crossed trip summer 2021! seems one idea whay talking about. Literally every candidate 2018's election would better known homophobe, mysoginist, dictatorship-loving piece shit spent almost two decades congressman nothing show it. Brazilians choice, matter fact plenty choices, decided worst possible one. Also, Lula ruled election pretty early arrest, which, although beside point, shitty political arrest anyway.
You come across someone know anything Brazil's 2018 race simply one Bolsonaro's apologista. all. Sweden export oriented economy, losing everyone's panicky behavior, local businesses especially individuals hit places locked down.

We definitely starting lock now, new cases deaths steadily dropping despite us keeping society functioning. gym muscles

well planned diet losing fat


To lose diet exercise basically exercise many hours, unless already huge muscles burn lots calories. Keep churning Covid! Gotta sweep planet thing get past this. love her, get tested returns. Tropical Trump Trump. Wew lads, that's like Europe.

You're really trying give Brazil run money article says ""Anyone travelling Ireland abroad required fill Passenger Locator Form, states person ""may contacted 14 days arrive Ireland check self isolating"".

Does sound like way Irish government know anything number infections possible infections brought country? essential life supporting equipment installed easy unplug first place? Scientific polling less valuable personal anecdotes? got impression think know everything subject, I'm sure where. became fairly insulting reasons unclear me. like explain major issues points posted zoonoses greater development illness areas higher concentration population and/ direct better source, happy learn more. confessed ignorance ineptitude area already thread Thats definitely good point. kinda like Y2K phenomenon. family large cookout tonight graduation celebration. masks course. Thankfully parents sense dad told cry they’re ventilators.

I expressed similar feelings. None extended family taken seriously. even 70 year old grandmother. started new job yesterday. nobody indoors wearing mask.

The evidence point towards things here:

2. already clinical drug treatments significantly reduce mortality. way, frontloading deaths Sweden hsa already lost 

3. major questions raised durable immunity studies shown [not long all, antibodies longer detectable *always* open questions re: meaningful immunity would disease, remain. Therefore pursuing herd immunity knowing immunity worke *always* unethical risky gamble. 

We could already say March Sweden's strategy unthical highly unlikely work out. say great certainty [it well truly change voting people blue. kill enough vulnerable nursing homes really helped transmit virus. evidence? even looking highly doubt everything said think it’s eye test you’re alluding to.

No!

Well try again! India, dad worried sick, cares. America always #1! victory without sacrifice already nationwide protests? Ya Pirates neck neck division going break!

Its like 90s again! racist I'm taking national culture psychology. Go look racist means dictionary. Americans well certain context oriental cultures well another. elderly go die. Something isn’t adding continued downtrend deaths

Hispanics/Latinos (younger people) making vastly disproportinate (over represented) amount cases. Like ""Deciding Next 10% population, 44% cases 7% deaths"" (State Wide)

I imagine also case sun belt states (indoor) Construction similar jobs getting cases. talked much media though Look celebrating death people. guy. Perhaps that’s it’s working. government lied said masks don’t work weeks reversed course said masks magically started working protect catching virus, protect spreading it. Well it’s really hard people understand reasoning. say “wearing masks protects catching it” instead focusing “protect others you” part. great deal population, “protect others” isn’t goal. Amazon, Activision, Nike, Twitter, Disney etc. BLM corporate fueled, they've received hundreds millions donations liberal foundations, 100% political movement. corporations nowhere found people calling CCP buddies Hong Kong, comes BLM human rights suddenly start matter. Still trust Google? Interesting propaganda fed. pattern seems get big outbreaks particular area’s “let’s stay inside” season.

For sun belt (including Arkansas, Oklahoma Tennessee case even though aren’t traditionally included) stay inside summer go outside winter.

The west quite ride stay inside summer winter. almost even know there's pandemic going live (yavapai county) never less people stores usual, like %10 people wear mask, parties happening usual, crazy. FYI guns germs steel like coloring book version human history. author roasted many times probably idea unplugging. trying make patient comfortable. justification tho. saying lied us. trust people admit lied us? knew phase one Started. Everyone know read understand data. 

I know impossible sarcastic. really believe statements also believe god created child rapists serial killers. Keep believing guess. long invite virus, I'm sure fine. depressing witness handle America European perspective. family, sister nephews, US worry lot them. *they*?

cases *down* new york city. 1,000 per day protests started, 300-400. also conspiracy? know 14 days later? getting numbers? adult diapers? going enforced. They've got priviledge know people dumb? smh  great leap towards trashing Florida's reputation place retire to. keep hearing bullshit... like okay GJ testing now... still 4k new cases... like focus fact testing people that's it. numbers mean anything. since Brazil 50% positivity rate, likely 10-50x many cases, want positivity rate 1% upstate NY happy see 99% people wearing masks stores morning - employees, customers, everyone. interesting poor decision making worse situation gets. get trying reopen state save economy. 

But reopening state guarantee worst case scenario. guarantee number cases increase. guarantee things need reclose, again. guarantee recovery would exceptionally longer conpared leaving things closed. 

It's almost ""leaders"" purpose make things worse. Nothing attempt lessen blow. feel like twilight zone. 

Opening economy might give slight boost short term. long run people get sick. people lose jobs. business close permanently. people die economy even worse shape. could elected leaders possibly short sighted stupid?

They aren't. want die. working. reopening plan never Covid saving lives, rather getting people back work, save economy, ensure governors election. 

Human life? impact economy people die got job back.

All governor cares next election... Conversely, cordially invite share Michigan winter us. won’t characterize reaction like regarding northerners heat. come see fare. deliberately 100% knowledge outcome? Yes know. lots outcomes this:

1. Kushner pocketed kickbacks. YES, KNEW WOULD HAPPEN.
2. government would receive unusable product. NO, NEITHER KNEW CARED WOULD HAPPEN. STILL KNOW STILL CARE.

I would wish meet Trump Kushner, did, would act matter shows appropriate respect myself. think best course action would turn back walk away. better person. mean doesn’t basically prove lockdowns futile since lockdown lifted flares again?

No? handled shit well times. China ~5000 deaths. That’s like normal 2 week span US. Even math won’t convince you. Sorry bud truth won’t good. believe already believe doubt information would change mind. parents keep saying whole thing planned order keep us home online companies make big bucks. Trying convince probably isnt wont listen. 

Any uncounterable arguments yall got? tried everything could think of. Also people measles influenza vaccines appear protected. That’s maybe best response comment like I’ve ever seen. Nothing like age demographic blithe general rejection problem. it’s okay got big Gretch! That's protocol relevant apps use, that's bit misleading. Also really tracker, exposure notification. I’m sure hold court administration spreading lies seriousness virus. High score Actually going finally take trip NY MI visit mom. planned going March. figure I'm going catheterize wife sons visit bathroom in-between. Sweden LÖL-ing. lockdowns meant nothing.  Arizonans = Kazakhstanis?

Apparently yes Well I'm opinion hospitals gonna full choice shutdown again. cops. people ""brutalizing"" much MUCH higher rate ring well this.

Im looking forward covid stats July. It’s worth nothing anthropologists think Jared Diamond full six weeks see super spreader events: football games.

The amount people hellbent attending one mind-blowing. Anyone know authorized tracker app allow enable setting? (PA). going “green” Friday fact infections moving I-95 back NE great news us month so... reason still answered question?

Have run excuses? lots mask wearing vigilance, along strong leadership lot luck helped us tremendously. Honestly, people can't afford that. 9k savings. wife baby Apr 27. 3rd kid. Still gotten money maternity leave go back work month. money comes overtime since university closed, lost chunk checks. 5k savings. fortunate enough savings job. can't even imagine like people still gotten relief checks, emergency savings, even job. work mental health facility runs day program program closed. Clients well wanna come back receive normal treatment. Staff difficult time getting clients attend virtual meetings. Seems like people would rather risk work worry they're gonna buy food pay rent fun rally President Orange keep describing corps excess deaths Covid-19 deaths.

The CDC acknowledged many excess suicides drug overdoses. Since shutdown, calls federal mental health crisis hotline surged 1,000 percent, FDA announced shortage Zoloft, popular anti-depressant drug due surge. Alcohol consumption 55 percent, drug abuse similar. shutdown three causes death accounted 190,000 deaths per year US. Countless include people don’t overdose die drug abuse related diseases.

Add excess nursing home deaths attributable shutdown well. sister works one various reasons caused shutdown, homes become miserable places patients languishing. Standard care slid lot families volunteers big part care, also put lots activities hold patients aren’t allowed see family. Many don’t even get bed anymore we’ll-being slipping. Poor care loneliness aren’t known great lifespan people median 5 months remaining lives date moved nursing home begin with.

On top that, tens millions Americans lost health care result shutdowns. reasonable expect don’t health care would higher mortality rates do. 

So yes excess deaths higher Covid-19 deaths. shouldn’t surprise anyone seriously considers effects lockdowns. One newest pet peeve people wear mask, lowered cover nose. Agree look context deciding whether wear mask. Arizona really bad right now. Huge spike hospitalization deaths trending couple weeks. 

  article months old it’s photoshop.

,,l,,(-_-),,l,, saying since states started reopening.

Not single state plan routine testing essential workers obvious way identify outbreak explodes. said Florida compared Denmark, yet Denmark around covid death rate Germany 104/Million. 

Actually Denmark Florida almost exact population density. Noo feel bummed places gets better now, like Europe parts Asia. However America South America numbers going crazy.

I cant find source said couple days ago virus spreading faster worldwide ever has. reached peak yet, havent killed first waves yet dont know ever leave first place. yeah long vaccine, pretty much get worse seems everyone already forgotten it. Nobody going say anything protests might get disciplined. 

Here real questions.

Do think okay protests happen even people attacked playing golf going beach?

Should media attack people beach taking using trick shut virus got there, problem. yeah deaths per capita in... thousands new COVID-19 cases Pleasanton, California. Source? essentially saying many dumbasses live that's can't it. 

I take point, take account probably would better position government political willpower beat thing. 

I believe impossible New Zealand proved otherwise. end day, virus gonna learn new behaviours potentially dangerous. hospitals gonna full, choice shutdown again. Guarantee it. brother know survival rates 80's? 

That's sad family prepared risk Grandma's health. There's arguing people either this. Somehow America turned virus political issue. 

I'm UK we've done well dealing this, least people think political issue sort hoax. husband same. got February still messed up. prior conditions, healthy before. chest starts burning walks street eats carb (very weird???), things.  Good point. Re-worded it. speaking Kitsap only. People say political, is, whether like not. opinion US well situation due intense polarization facing. issue sides. There's unity, there's trust. someone one side says something, side believe it.

Most us part problem, everytime engage polarization make worse. seen figureheads sides say things ok, things not. people right refuse wear mask incoherent reasons. people left actually encouraged mass gatherings protests, sometimes riots, people condemned reopening america protests. sake ideology, giving polarization.

I think people concerned spreading ideology limiting spread covid. People insulated ideology matters. chance trot ideology, that's people matter what. That's now, opinion. think extreme lack national unity huge contributor issue. worst part think much it. point would take unprecedented national disaster unite country even probably enough, would instantly politicized. multibillion dollar corporations? mean doesn’t basically prove lockdowns futile since lockdown lifted flares again? China couldn’t control it, you’re literally required tracking app phone infected welded homes...then one else going control it. Sure, accountability people acting like bunch children Website clearly shows drive thru testing well state limit amount people per day. Im scared shitless Texas Greg Abbott owned state back like virus one social distancing wearing masks. Could almost make someone believe ulterior motive, like gunning inheritance. 

The lethality 90+ extremely high. would anyone think good idea. none family members voicing concerns? That’s governor might overwhelming miss point making mean overwhelming misses point. ""they're still perfect Super! Wow! Neat!® experiments.""

From page It’s hard get people social distance months government mishandling everything. seen across globe, yes impossible know strategy work given place. peaked yet. India densely populated country, population high. old people communities FL safe contained. No, deliberate fraud. even trying sports year? unnecessarily risky involved. You, everyone else, infact live 18 months without sports. potentially, might find interesting things there... Fuck mate we’re good Arnold says people morons. wonder guardian doesn’t care thousand black lives protesting. Must racist. confederate statues built ex-confederates like lost war. statues confederate general later founded KKK. American tax dollars funded statues Civil War. want know hear anything Germany tearing Nazi statues? _There none._ teaching people actual history instead preaching defending white supremacists ideologists figures. issue media hoax media complicit hoaxing us fucking many times before. Yea they’re pushing phase 3 Kitsap. It’s South Asia starting get hit hard? knew America.

Also, hell lack huge outbreaks Africa? surface seem elements occurred now. ride century rides HR 160's-170's five six hours straight.

80-100 barely warmup. Rigor mortis may help hold after...... write bernie still. Oh....and guess political affiliation? 6th grade. Dont live anywhere near guess teachers handled lot different. news TV live. watching first tower throwing smoke, saw second one get hit. school shut whole thing towers fell, teachers told us fell. child, didnt really know think. virus? /s still arent ?Still alive
This covid mess joke. 

Three weeks nationwide protests, would expect see people (go look large protests got crowdwize) dropping like flies corona past two week ""incubation period"" 

Nope happening. 

As flu still elderly immune compromised (smokers, diabetics, fatties) problem  pure democracy trample people’s rights easily king can. Full democracy desirable. Yeah. already low opinion humanity 2020, yet pandemic people's idiotic response made opinion plummet even lower. happened Illinois green? I'm Massachusetts went store yesterday first time 4 months. Home Depot every single person saw wearing mask. made really proud state. 


If people they're supposed numbers down. hate became political issue. stupid. It’s almost like states took serious prolonged measures starting see solid relief states halfassed heating up. thought supposed wear mask anytime may come 6 feet 2 meters another person. Arizona friend ranting phone going go unemployment masks required county big enough *ussy wear one! I’m “spreading” disinformation - recognize real threat one need take seriously. That’s reason mess, people discounting potential harm.

All I’m saying wouldn’t entirely rule origin virus could lab. It’s implausible. Thanks loving parents life instead possible death. hope able safely hug loved ones soon! It’s not. girlfriend leave home groceries, outdoor walks, pick takeout. Haven’t seen friends 3 months haven’t haircut since 3/12 lol. I’m Atlanta, cases growing state again, knowing I’m right thing what’s keeping sane, despite others giving shit anymore. 

The thing wish could participating BLM matches protests. Get pissed bull shit media pundits listen Fox News whatever flavor podcast give minds to. Deaths increase. always lag initial infection. know better treatment since April? Plug numbers line ya. looking intraday #s use worldometers like everyone else sad full souls tiny, insecure, gotta appeal ego, stroke vigorously, put fucking mask on. Good, learning. Michigan active cases Canada iirc. eager reopen border. 3500 rupees 46 US dollars, right? 5 days worth treatment. tylenol-level pricing hugely expensive drug either child, remember rules. incivility allowed sub :) Maybe attendees sign NDAs sue admit getting sick. would style. FL's death rate likely high NY's, studies vitamin helping prevent severe cases correct. get way sun USA isn’t one response rather 50 distinct responses. states actually done really well, whereas others done really poorly. Yeah, u see pattern across countries great terms containing virus. Numbers picking around month measures reduced lifted.

And opening tourist really helpful.

Can't wait autumn inevitable ""how could know?!"" cases explode again. one know sure. Largely though, they've much less exposure common pathogens overall, might quite different genetic characteristics to, inherit everything small pool. american, I’m willing try first policy, I’m yet sold second. sub moderated half stories probably made up. 70 percent estimation based statement Merkel March? repeated estimation recently? Sir, Wendy's. 

...This *second* time many days one missed huge #Translation header top *article news source* aka text write myself, rather translated. problem TV2's article contact directly, yell person merely translated it: willful idiots - authority enough brains understand stuff care. Even Trump everyone around tested daily wear masks including advisor/daughter Ivanka according herself: 

**Ivanka Trump: wear mask near Donald Trump 'everyone instructed well'**
May 15, take actions proect citizens sworn serve.

IF even trump gets danger know others legit excuse especially numbers. tweets trump ripping Obama two dead citizens Ebola somehow situation fine them.

So believe? going herd immunity decent science it? goal? one? 

Because masks measures maybe requiring businesses increase outside air improve filtration limits hvac proven ways reduce spread respiratory illnesses **CHEAPER**, mention **MORAL**, letting covid19 rip though world sickening killing people lingering painful way. 😂😂😂 BRAINWASHED need go back red everywhere Look real science Homerun numbers way year, though, looks like they're really cracking sign stealing year Title misleading mentioning US casualties played fairly small role war compared European countries. Total deaths around 20 million people. watched report CNN cut back anchor, dumbfounded. TLDR: Everyone back dork maintain profit rich investors... Sorry hear hope conditions improve. hope public informed long term effects. Yeah say “please don’t kill grandma” anyone leaves house reminder keep PPE protocol. realize it’s bit harsh, gets right meat why... Yeah statue nice raise? wish badly need include that/s people post saying seriousness horrifying. conjecture virus claimed vulnerable ones quickly hence lowered deaths despite increasing infections. thought real evidence back Stay outside sun, 6 feet away, risks greatly minimized. feel like hear news week past 6-8 weeks. reduce trump votes 2% coming next election. sounds like solid plan! I'll definitely ask ahead live red county CA. I'm seeing masks, certainly enough. don’t vote. math checks out. LOT higher voter turnout year! I'll still sit table 🤷‍♂️ want come back comment happens People argument reopening though mean, test positive sure it.

Do really feel certain playing safe? It’s perfectly rational play safe, emreally confident results I’m curious why. looked studies tests’ efficacy? someone tested positive taken test multiple times see he/she gets different result? sure positive results aren’t picking types corona viruses? 

I thought may symptoms weeks ago wife (who pregnant) got tested. test came back negative came back positive (she asymptomatic). Ok, fine maybe mine false negative and/or maybe gotten already. maybe never did, somehow never gave despite locked together. 

So 2 week quarantine thing go back get tested (a different place time, thought maybe first place switched tests something). get results back 24 hours (negative again) still back 72 hours later.

Ok, fine. even get back certain results? could still false negative/positive. symptoms quarantine still positive 2 week quarantine? information really learn. 

I totally understand taking precautions playing safe, doesn’t make super confident tests themselves. 

I haven’t seen research rigors test experiments people taking tests multiple times see get different results

It seems so...arbitrary. instances outbreaks happened outside. look documented super spreader events, two distinct patterns outside health institutions: High frequency speech (Church,USA; church, Germany; church, Korea; call center, Korea) long hours close proximity physical labor (meat processing, USA; meat processing, Germany; Mining, Sweden). There's talk Spanish football fans catching virus match, could be, likely bus metro game. coughing storm, masks def norm, huddling together swarm, COVID night! Gotta defend No.1 position resurgent Brazil... /r/theydidntdothemath understand why, people shouldn’t surprised leads higher infections people pack in. look Chaz pictures country willing though. indoor crowd yelling cheering same. plan? buy plague mask Etsy. know someone wears one around. buy food take home? Look graph NY shut peaked cases deaths. Florida fucked even shut down. flagrant disregard health expert guidelines make Florida/Texas/Arizona case studies pandemic spread / mitigation efforts (or lack of). violates amendment shut country stopping people express right comers Well thankfully state travel still happening right now. least people going FL, theme parks reopening (or already open) expect travel start ticking back summer progresses.

We trip Disney planned October. Cancelled it. Gonna try next year hopefully. Assuming place yourself, yes. I'd maybe try air place first got maybe go somewhere else hours check in. AZ confirm many care. Masks mandated yesterday Maricopa County. Videos social media bar scene nobody wearing masks, bar jam packed etc. state many elders? believe spread aerosol (like flu measles) droplets Vegas lot worry low humidity Nitrous oxide like laughing gas? here, i've lost much respect people i've actually stopped interacting coworkers. puts knot throat see disrespect that's happening around me. OOOOOOOOklacovid! disease comes roaring plains!!!! seatbelts rubbers either! 100.0000% effective pointless inconvenience. ....I’m sorry missing something here, pandemic happened source wuhan, bet ass get sniff around. Leaked natural origin, let’s get story straight. distaste towards China CCP hand. would (opinion) anywhere else clear. contacted Last Prisoner Project matched them. One even email corrlinks. several one. Yes, must crowded together. @everydayexpert IG best Lyme stuff. According NIH study 2005-2007, unusual. fact, it’s pretty typical. “if bleeds, leads” guess. Newspapers desperate readership drum headlines like this.

From NIH study: “The percentage ICU beds cohort occupied ICU patients given hour ranged 57.4% 82.1% ... three years (Figure 1). Mean hourly occupancy change three years 68.2% (± 21.3) 2005 70.4% (± 22.8) 2007 (P = 0.25) (eTable 1).” also, “The mean hourly occupancy ICUs 68.2% ± 21.3, median 74.6% (IQR 53.4–86.1%, full range 17.4% 109.0%) (Figure 2; eTable 2).”

Here link study. line, 75%+ occupancy rate ICUs far unusual certainly unique coronavirus. Yep, statistics hard work. Hot spots poor control, starting low number begin with.

Speaking statistics; ""You know dumb average person is? Ya gotta keep mind, half people dumber that!"" - George Carlin (miss guy). Like Florida, Arizona, Saudi-Arabia... wait thought Florida fine proof Covid bullshit./s seems enforced one way friend. Nearly top upvotes comments political. Assuming state closed tomorrow, long would take numbers drop stabilize? Disney World apparently still planning opening July 15th. One group protesting systemic racially motivated murder police, group promoting it. one would deem ""essential""? Big Gretch got em shook There’s deaths increased testing!!!!! /s think genuinely concerned. think can't insult anyone hispanic, literally Spanish speaking. lot Spanish speakers actually use phrase, hispano. speaking young woke crowd, might get angry insist say latinx

As Spanish speaking immigrant, refuse. use latinx. can't pronounce Spanish. even way x used native languages (eg. nahuatl) words like xotitl Sonos &lt;chilling series pics police arresting woman praying protest front rally also pretty upsetting, especially since later announced arrested request Trump campaign even though committing crime. least police wearing masks? Technically north bridge, anywhere near bridge beyond basically northern Michigan. real riddle ""up north"" happens be? Omg get lucky people get sick, red hats going scream us wrong long.

They understand ""high risk"" mean guaranteed death. realllly bad idea. 

""I dumb thing nothing happened"" rallying cry reckless 14yo boys, I'm hearing adults now. wild different things close by. live like 45 minutes northwest Detroit mask use matter people doing. I'd say maybe half people stores using them, that's generous. live conservative area though risk going go away, though? date, sure, understand logic waiting. don't. people supposed wait indefinitely, suffer violence police government unknown period time? indoor crowd probably tear gassed causing extra coughing. think people thinking it’s “cold”, go away warmth summer...just guess Bold choice Cotton... Scary stuff, right there. That’s gonna dog identify Hamster-Kin? really disagree anything said, even talking indoor business full capacity. I'm aware businesses open full capacity area. saw lots individuals without masks ignoring distancing soon limited businesses started opening partial capacity.

Forcing businesses stay closed going stop spread significant portion population can't act responsibly. bad eggs ruin everyone. No, go look yourself. one example get started:

 end, Trump's fault instead blame China incompetence. smh
This country beyond help. lot tell they're plenty scared virus, they're willing put lives line view justice, especially face police beating skulls arresting journalists. every protest I've seen wave facemasks people handing hand sanitizer. 6 advancemen infected

&amp;#x200B;

how many advancemen there? 100% IR, 75% IR 50% IR? It’s island.

But so, FUCKED economically. It’s already pretty rough survive is, entire state tourism dependent. long able keep 14 day quarantine guests? 0.5% deaths would 1.6 million people. happens, definitely volunteer. wasn’t Obama’s job send help Africa aid stopping Ebola?
Not two viruses similar, preventative actions taken Obama line president stop American pandemic.  😂🤣 NY times wrote similar PM's hair Canada. weird.  think they're saying. graph page Wonderful question, I’m sure don’t proper ear protection either... Yep

My school person 

And bet loose money either way First - isn’t 1000 *murders*. It’s thousand *deaths* run gamut justified shooting wrongful homicide.

Second - narrative police brutality justification millions people stacking top protest middle pandemic, significant harm needs empirically proven. 1000 deaths population 340 million significant risk. Tourism completely what’s causing it. Second problem entire economy based it. Yes, famously open well organized democratic primary evidence intended voter suppression whatsoever, including refusal shut in-person voting favor mail-in ballots global pandemic. That's amazing considering I'm seeing tons people distancing wearing masks here. virus 20% death rate.

It hypothetical, genius. ball. different year. kept bag really makes hard pickup comes pitchers hand. last point wrong even funny. could possibly foreseen development? SE MI would say 70% still wearing masks gone Meijer Home Depot last week. Lots places requiring people wear masks enter well. Welcome mitten, amigo. someone substantial amount family industries proud work, totally disagree automation.

And UBI don’t think works. discussion people know way better UBI, everything go price ensure class society. Bordering? Un contained pathogen spreading exponentially country, fifth population without source income , mass riots protests. 
Idk... think may already crossed border working according metric? thing care ""number things open,"" I'm sure working fine. 

Cue everyone ""we knew cases would go up"" camp saying ""this fine."" far understand Preclinical data, phases: kind gaslighting public health crisis inexcusable.  Something potentially useful may yet come this... sent private prisons slave labor. case music festivals sporting events okay masks worn It’s gonna hilarious single new case this.

You know lamestream media watching case counts region like fucking Hawks there’s even single increase you’ll see headlines “TrUmP rAlLy CaUsEd SpIkE cAsEs!!!” Except US states say motorcycle helmets impact freedom (to get brain damage guess). 'Murica! celebration number one US Humans.... dumbest animal planet. Perfect thank you! could drop rule vaccine found early  3 days row new daily record many trials treatment testing? Thank you.  Replication protesters protesters general public takes bit. goes partiers memorial day 4 weeks ago. Michigan actually meeting metrics adequate contact tracing testing (as well hospital ICU capacity). never going get zero without closing borders, chance contain outbreaks locally become big clusters. Disney World open up? cant afford buy afford laundry maybe month. Someone said could make one though thankfully, single clean clothing item, rag, bandana, towel cover face able go laundry today I'm freaking bit. So, words, saying locking state governments helped hospitals. Thanks, seen before. know live Spain apparently second-best air quality world, nice. 

Was supposed fly Florida next week 4-week vacation. Stay safe there, looks like gonna rough ride. Nice work bot. crawl back government prefers herd propaganda effective pandemic policies... makes sense. wife son covid symptoms wife needing inhaler breathe. get test March April unless health care workers ICU state.  others company results Covid symptoms. state offering free drive thru testing anyone wants symptoms no. Well talking contained nearly. Michigan high beginning Whitmer put strict rules we're great. 
But thank they'll say something like 
-- see look death rate low never needed 
Or something along lines Good time Buccos fan! happened ‘law order’ bs red hats? 
Such filth hypocrisy . lol like rule masks southern Michigan. closer get Ann arbor, high percentage population wear masks Followed “Californians ignore orders wear face masks public” That’s great places California people state care San Francisco, Los Angeles San Diego, don’t think making big statement thinks hoax trusted orange president said himself, go drink bleach make feel better. 43% ICUs since April 15th. Knock off. average ICU beds use without pandemic 57% 82%. Also, new cases mortality serious conditions percentage going down. government pdf 43% sure link it. Knock off! Friday, Texas racked 4,497. That’s double numbers week ago, even beats previous high number governor Greg Abbott blamed numbers prisons nursing homes getting bundled together. Abbott’s biggest achievement Friday declaring would remove executive order keeps cities counties creating local mask mandates. However, earlier week support keeping restriction southern U. S. border prevent transmission COVID-19. probably good idea. counted 3,822 new cases Friday. That’s 600 cases previous high … Thursday. Texas, number daily cases reported state 200% numbers week earlier. rather announce new precautions, governor Ron DeSantis took break earlier excuses blame roaming bands watermelon-picking Hispanics state’s surge. would hilariously racist wasn’t also true. Making much less hilarious, infinitely racist. I’m guessing USA 50k per day 4th July. plan? No. Blue officials tried best Trump anti-science anti-facts nonsense, could get traction federal level.

Time drop goddamned both-siderism... not, never been, never specific subject sides fricking problem. Super scary. people need know this!! level threat covid represents health.

Isn't half problem? People thinking selfishly rather overall good society?

If testing running full capacity, easy do, free fast get results, people could travelling issues right people thinking ""I feel ok fuck everyone else"" madness. mind can't changed countries significant failings government, disorganisation, general lack public cohesion. I'm thinking US, UK, Sweden etc.

These countries still minimal traveling measures place know virus managed tested traced.

COVID poses little threat me, want giving random shop assistant, hotel worker bar staff infect potentially pass someone interact home risk category. Ah yes, representatives seem think ignore Rona like bill wanna pay average American go spending dollars. 

Gotta get money. seem difficult control masks indoors limitation close/crowded indoor gatherings. 

I think many/any states going go back type lockdowns April, maybe we'll start seeing concerted effort get people wear masks. sign submission. 
This experiment gonna end well. Holy mental backflips, batman! admit much puss wear masks! Texas

go away troll Imagine accidentally killing family member like blaming doctors. Wow.

RIP :( Trolling ugly Texas, we're absurd battle mayors governor. Gov says can't require people wear face masks. ""You've got ways keep people safe,"" says. Nevermind fact wearing face masks literally one *only* things reduce spread. 

So mayor resort weak ass proclamation *recommends* wearing face coverings, emphasizes can't *make* it. 

Then, week, guess city's crack legal team finally epiphany: now, businesses city required covid plan keep customers visitors safe, post plan visibly. kicker, plan must require customers wear face covering. So, government can't make wear mask, make business owners make customers wear masks. someone problem it, ""Hey, voting citizen, *I'm* taking away precious right mouthbreathe unimpeded—it's damn business owner making it. we're business rights around here, right partner?""

And local grocery stores conceded stop making people wear masks inside. Snip snap, snip snap. coordination agreement top bottom. Story whole response. responsible president would say ... “a rally worth risk public health safety.” president ... “you must sign waiver get in.” ??? Sure thing.

Just like North Korea. hyperbole here. America handling like North Korea. Atleast cold beers got bad news. I've also read tests unreliable. trusting comes things politicized. Well, possibly. article told everyone safe place be, picture hundreds people flocking Michigan. likely hotspot. 🥺 Can't win unless mask assume we, everyone else, sick bit.😷 People terrified getting anthrax filled envelope back early 00s catching disease.

I don’t think it’s time go back clubs pub crawl, that’s risky. wearing mask out, going restaurant socially distanced seating &amp; employees wearing masks, using hand sanitizer... sounds like reasonably low risk me. take precautions. safe! “You right” Yeah .. it’s complete disregard anything . different time right now.. historically things get better quickly reliable data available ICU beds hospitals handling this? 100% this. people wearing masks necessarily think help; they're wearing masks President made political statement. I'm sure scenario worse. hard tell also matches states reopening lots people cutting frequency mask use. Due numbers concentrations people I'm sure play part, hard pin entirely one factor lot changes US last weeks.  Trump tbh.... Hey young healthy Floridians: time book parties Mar-a-lago! /s

I’ve saying months: take care wear mask nobody else care health, even president. hell ""Covid Act Now""? Clicking map assessments appear made almost individual county data. appears rhyme reason color scheme click individual states (check Missouri, instance). map looks Cuomo Whitmer commissioned someone set lol Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Arizona like ""why cases spiking lol must Jesus intended. live Michigan (Detroit area) work around ton people refuse wear masks, wash hands dropping duece, etc governor (Democrat) fuck bc needs appease Trumpers science denying Bible thumpers using executive power fix problem hand like Gov. Pritzker (Democrat) neighboring Illinois. He's using executive power Republicans rural areas challenge court says ""ok lmao I'll see ya court"". 

Flint still drinking LEAD WATER btw. much really changed lack media coverage sadly. Former means little many athletes fall right cliff physically stop competing. Also, linemen would crazy high risk getting sick. spell mean post right sounds like care people die long they're old. Get fast likely alot factors, outside, alot masks worn, testing sites closed whole lot young people probably getting tested.. Especially symptoms. Haha, wish maybe next year beloved Cleveland Indians winning World Series. Right now, it’s maybe next year season  Ah. Ok. see, thought meant something different. 

I can’t find chart anymore remember seeing uptick mortalities overt baseline pandemic started. Personally I’m side coin thinking directly covid. 

The wild one pneumonia excess deaths double stable baseline 60-50k per year, passed quarter time. Planet ""I've made decision virus, worth killing people want."" seems... dishonest. Proud home state! Thank Gretchen Bolivia someone ran advertisement someone actually dying COVID, understand collateral damage attached think might way get people take seriously fifth population without source income 

Uhh... dont think saying think saying. know old dudes going around spitting hands shaking thinking they're cute ""hoax"" going die weeks. Better late? I'm wearing mask! left property 3 months. Thankfully sock puppet keeps company wore mask first two weeks arrived. Unless full face mask even covers eyes filters air protected. extra vigilant, face masks protects others case virus way around. didn’t Also, risk virus mutating antibodies useful new strain. Like flu mutates, need new flu vaccine every year. Shocking, simply shocking. makes sense. taste gone, could taste anything whatsoever dull, literally everything tasted like nothing? Health Experts keep saying third inning now, instead second inning saying weeks ago. starters, open gain function studies virus back 2013. honest reporting this. death rate back march presumed 15 40 times higher reported.


so china give us shit start. however, blaming china right like 40 year old blaming fuck ups life parents. 


we better stockpiles.

we made public aware prepared.

we capped cornholios panic buying.

we encouraged face covering/mask usage febuuary.

we found ways maintain economic progress spite physical distancing measures. binary option.

we found ways make tests instead chloroquine.

we started public education campaign.

and cursory starting points.

it china's problem. problem. choose blame, go solving it.... like florida, ignore it... right. Look, concern legit. Everyone prudent authorities ask us do. hysteria helpful even harmful some. reading sub regular basis, people panicked simply aware, concerned prudent. Exponential growth hitting Texas. Already least 5 days 20%+. really think people indoor environments strangers present need wear masks. Obviously restaurants bars exempt obvious reasons. many outbreaks linked church services. politicization masks beyond stupid.

We also reduce mortality shifting public health message toward sequestering protecting old people. Every 25 year old going clubs needs educated staying hell away grandma.

But, generally, much do. way past it. Don’t worry, I’m sure wearing masks. Right. Lockdowns relaxed, cases climbing, deaths still trending down. First, common flu kills lot people. Second, coronavirus also vaccines. can't wait years stopping everything. Neither protesters. Maybe pay attention what's *actually* happening, desperately *want* happening. Ah shetttt insane Utah. get feeling everyone that's wearing mask, majority, passing judgement taking simple procaution wearing mask. mean fuck? used think person smart people group dumb. think everyone crazy. NYC double capacity?

 

You guys spinning too. ""ICU capacity always near capacity fear mongering"".....that truth either. understand trying convince people spin way....It's flu?, nothing see here?

Do believe ICU's hospitals completely overwhelmed throughout world Covid gets foothold area?

I care ""normally"" area seeing spike hospitalizations means ICU's going fill point less room sooner be. places start testing nursing homes aggressively. could partially explain increased age since elderly cases detected. Non american here. laughing. concerns breaks heart see happens, numbers, handling possible outcome american people. sayin. would take three week old crowded event circumstances? Please noise cancelling headphones. people, COVID-19 causes mild moderate symptoms, fever cough. severe cases lead death.

At point, think articles need stop saying this.

It's dangerous.

It's disingenuous.

And really know long term implications COVID survivors. took couple seconds look would see India several nuclear disasters. Also problem lack air conditioning hospitals another symptom systematic neglect public India. It’s tricky situation. thing makes ethically complicated they’re putting lives line, also lives didn’t consent risk. whole moral responsibility calculus becomes much convoluted pandemic.

Nice timing, today heard people allowed go church without mask (when seated) again.

Imagine down-voted pointing unethical wrong something is. eventually issues mask order. 

Mayor Demmings (D course he's sane), Orange county. We’re going witness super spreader event tonights rally Tulsa. folks support trump also believe masks destroy liberty. 

Think it, thousands people one building, sharing air, cheering dear leader. 

Folks CDC need pay attention folks get sick connected rally. We’re gonna see BIG spread. Dude, what? routinely make little sense? trump past months equivalent bringing tens thousands people fifth avenue, shooting head. getting away it. Bring 'merican top. Sorry thanks! rephrase original comment. Thanks China No, 5G /s protests millions across country count? alarm probably , still, think ventilator patient . makes sense small percentage population exposed yet. promote people moving? turn head, means rich people don’t move jobs live big houses tax-free, people move never get rebate.
Or people would never dare buy starter house makes sense instantly buy house you’ll ever live in! kind disincentive labor mobility huge issue economics, suggestion would make worse.
And people stop moving, lose critical tax revenue even people don’t stop using whatever funded that.

People living HCOL areas massively gained wealth property rising value given preferential treatment. take big bag cash they’ve made move don’t feel like getting moneys’ worth. 

But generally shouldn’t tax value property land. would stimulate building multi-family homes instead never-ending single-family McMansion suburbias. way you’re basically splitting land value tax number families plot. white people killed police black people. violent crimes caused black people white people. police officer likely killed black person black person likely killed police officer, far. understand downvoted. teams come fall other, one team antibodies testing positive, team's star player and/or multiple players quarantine, seems pretty obvious. isn’t adding continued downtrend deaths

It takes pretty long time die COVID. It’s anywhere 2-14 days show symptoms, another 1-2 weeks symptoms get bad enough go hospital, average 8 days hospitalization death (though lot longer- patients spent months ventilator). new deaths always weeks behind new cases. US really cruel self-centered place half population care death toll, care personal wealth. hot countries people outside getting hit hard (Brazil), lots countries better getting summer (most Europe). Moreover, many US hotspots, people stay indoors lot summer heat. longer live Florida born raised lived life Keys. I’m glad rule implemented, locals response heartbreaking. Claiming range “slippery slope/rights trampling” “MaSks DoN’t work! dIE CO2 pOiSioning!”, would say general response locals outrage.

It true “the farther south go, farther north are” Florida, promise Sourh Florida stupid it’s breed. There’s thing low humidity Michigan. There’s place state that’s two miles away body water. highest humidity country. evidence virus manipulated lab. Several labs study coronaviruses we’ve known since least SARS 2003 things dangerous could turn we’re seeing now. would academic malfeasance didn’t study understand infects. fact knew soon thing broke uses ACE2 receptor enter cells, knew proteins virus immune system uses ultimately inactivate kill due last 17 years work. reason vaccine even possible last 17 years research. 

So yeah. We’ve studying manipulating viruses decades prepare monster didn’t know. know researchers blamed lunatics. That's big part it. masks - they've walked back lot things. Even want trust experts they're giving clear answers.

It also help lot people encouraging Floyd protests condemning lockdown protests. virus sentient know difference, made expert advice look like based politics science. Smart move would consistency. Beg people find means physical mass gatherings. Correct.  Way Kokomo?? Antiintellectualism. Still, *a perfect 0.1%?* go.  wonder lack testing Africa setting situation like thought spreading US quite time NYC exploded. basing anything conjecture, hopefully not. That's it.

New York pretty low deaths now. Even going back month, they've dropped 50 deaths per day average.

Meanwhile national average dropped nearly 700 deaths per day.

New York explain it. body choice Yes, 90... anything south much hotter. hit 90 week, maybe need set reminder 3 weeks see heat affects case load there.

Also 90 degrees low humidity great outside weather. Everyone coming Wisconsin? think shocking someone 40+ (I'm assuming maybe 50 60) would 1000 sq ft hold huge party

I mean going risk life rather huge place, backyard outside lots air windows doors open air conditioner recirculated air? BBQ season ... would still endanger lives workers. population 1940 132.1 million. really think half US population (all men, million women) died WW2? Smart move considering many reports (suspected confirmed) cases exported Sweden people pissed mask laws, wait til hear seatbelt laws! Atleast stuffing dead refrigerated trucks like ""first world"" America. huge deaths like Italy. came realization global warming kill us think got lucky Canada. amount folk arguing local walmart masks, sheer number people wandering grocery stores family *browsing* aisles (without masks) staggering.

We seemed abide lockdown things loosening seems everyone thinks over. 0.0004* 7,500,000 = 3,000 risking life

And lives others.

They stupid; they're malicious ignorance. age confirmed.cases.is dropping.

Can give cite? Also, that's confirmed cases? mean average age infected people dropping, increases testing picking young people getting tested before. alarm blaring one noticed??

If happens, suppose going happen rest Europe reopens? think then? tested results, death rate 5.2% worldwide. I' giving leeway 2-3x people infected reported. Time open everything up! look like states opened everything up. Better need now, fall hits everyone congregates back inside shit definitely hitting fan. feel like least likely debilitating issues already healthy world class doctors watching them.

I’m content watching tv. making mistake believing tell truth got it. sun. UV damages brain. [IHME estimates New York 100k new infections per day March 21-27, even though course never confirmed many. Florida would never confirm many infections testing hundreds thousands people day time next weeks. Shoo bot Sort controversial discussions. Fresh new dress WI, stores required maybe 30% compliance. Costco Aldi's me... question. think headline pretty misleading. bunch vaccines tested people right now, started long one. Well ok told Since people think people free  Many countries zero cases. Vancouver Island (population 870,000) I’d say it’s 10-20% shopping groceries, less about. zero reported cases island weeks though, feel like everyone thinks we’re fine. wanted say people area society actually blew away wearing masks following six foot guidelines. work retail food industry town frickin ghost town week everyone staying home work. actually staying inside! lost concern compassion along way somehow. sure pressure people platforms calling ""weaknesses"" people wearing masks, what; opinion, started going downhill onset summer (people wanted outside enjoy summer) riots media Police (major distraction pushed hidden agendas government provocateurs social media). Could sworn would Florida Texas. almost refreshing moronic covid headline related USA team lost season though, obviously we're track sportsball trophy. Woohoo, Georgia's red....wait, thats good thing Remember “just cases coming China” “the dem’s new hoax” “we everything control” “face masks don’t help” Read paper actually says. control “standard practice” high percentage mask wearing, “occasionally”. lack true maskless control makes whole thing uninterpretable way trying to. 

The authors state much:

“Owing high level mask use control arm, unable determine whether differences medical cloth mask arms due protective effect medical masks detrimental effect cloth masks.”

This study well-designed support claim trying make. want say mask wearing dangerous public setting, need data address claim.

This paper gets frequently cited internet posts, it’s poor evidence claim cloth masks inherently dangerous general public. 

I encourage read author update restate limitations study (even solely considering protection hcw assumed old news Saturday news first.

Dr check-ins, still waiting stress test call again? kind distrust GP can't get another. agriculture dense population, people whose ancestors Afro-Eurasia tend better immune systems.

People whose ancestors North America, South America, Oceania mostly lived sparsely populated, isolated areas without cities, mega commerce trade, little, agriculture. chance develop common colds, flus, chicken pox, etc. that's immune systems respond poorly.

I read account Native American redditor month ago said growing reservation, even exposed chicken pox child. got chicken pox teenager moved reservation general society.

Meanwhile, Native American know anyone *hadn't* gotten chicken pox age 10. got vacation England 4. shit. catch wrong date. sure saying me. misuse idiom confusing me.

They've together 9 years love travel anything save money everything else that.
It took finally move Perth WA closing border finally things going well. Except know we'll able visit able come visit us again. U.S. poor job disease may never let Americans - can't blame that. thought seeing son, wife and, probably next year so, grand child knows long killing me. He’s postal worker. He’s clearly insured. one exposed them. flu passes river.... relevant? forthright. like Jared not?

Health good, diet pretty clean, fairly regular exercise. much blame falls CDC saying masks helpful February March?   DoCToRs KNOw ANythinG eCOnOmY. Lol yes.

That's so... perfectly example. Countries gotten hit followed exact pattern, lockdown not. Get hit, spike up, get around 10% infected, reopen, second spike.

If true China wouldn’t second lockdown. heated mask debate say least. catch article. case, defer people hospitals equipped handle outbreak. Right whole health care industry seems giant mismanaged mess Hospitalizations still down, good. Yeah, binged 4 pints ice cream, put bunch weight.

I don’t think so. Northern Michigan also open weeks places I’ve to- past manistee area, people haven’t wearing masks! Interesting data though.... one day. backlog. We're dozens cases day now, less 10 deaths day. Yesterday general update. death case rising, least now. going fix then? time anyone posts evidence reported covid fatality infectiousness, someone always responds like did. 

If it’s really bad say, going it? live country actively killing people (according believe system)? put dead grandmas grandpas?

Except, truth is, won’t anything you’re either lazy afraid accept real logical reasons mainstream media would want drum much fear possible. People PROFITING pandemic. Jeff Bezos, multi-billionaire owner Amazon made much money due increase people turning shopping online “safety”. Bezos ALSO owns Washington Post - news outlet pumping fear daily. connection obvious. 

Except...you’re willing believe government killing you? that’s extreme belief you’re operating under, you’d better start taking action support it, cuz that’s pretty wild. going government killing you? call strawmanning. read every one statements posters comments section alone, never mind threads subreddit."
