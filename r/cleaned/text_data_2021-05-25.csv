0,2021-05-25,"  I'm criticizing study, I'm saying media making results clear/accurate reporting. still leave non-refrigerated groceries box hall, wash hands touching stuff 3 days. Ditto mail - sits quarantine 1-3 days (paper/cardboard 1 day).  
Food delivery also song dance. We've known probably necessary, we've long we're close totally vaccinated, figured we're protected, *just case*. Neighbours nurses doctors, I've heard them. They'd leave shoes outside door, step in, strip down, dump clothes wash, shower hard. I'm sure psychological aspect well, really terrified catching Covid giving family. haven‚Äôt seen many people wanting keep kids home still. seen - support - people suggest keeping mask mandates kids vaccinated safely able go live normally. Almost experts US underestimating amount natural immunity US trying calculate herd immunity.

Israel seems hit herd immunity 60 percent population vaccinated 9 percent confirmed Coronavirus testing. 

Let‚Äôs estimate 3 times actual number cases confirmed cases. Let‚Äôs also assume 25 percent people infected got vaccine. would add additional 20 percent people acquired immunity didn‚Äôt get vaccinated.

So Israel telling us 80 percent works herd. Could couple points lower.

The US infection rates higher vaccination rates lower date. 40 percent fully vaccinated another 30 percent natural Immunity haven‚Äôt received virus. Almost there! might unpopular thought sub concerned pathogens/germs. aside serious stuff, benefit exposed germs moderation help build immunities.

Not saying go lick bus seat, need careful society overdo sanitization...especially anti-bacterials evolve immunities attempts control them...aka creating super bugs. balancing act know either. also wishful thinking assume lockdown less dangerous Covid, since cant compare two decisions one never chosen. dont know outcome locked 14 days stop spread. Happy cake day! Eh ... successful keeping COVID get called opening up? Right. I'm Connecticut too, state handling COVID incredibly well throughout entire pandemic, now. Sure slip-ups like spikes summer fall vacations time meet family came around, generally, well enough still enough hospital beds. Given, state rather low population compared states, everywhere I've going, everyone wears masks. curiousity (not saying it'll ever happen), Japan somehow drop out, feasible would US UK (who mostly fully vaccinated then) host Olympics short notice? Well, Turkey, schools partially opened last November. apply class (I school since 2020 March), applied 8th 12th graders (in grades enter national exam). mother middle school teacher (she teach 8th graders) school absolutely ravaged COVID. least 5 cases day. clearly spreading school. November case numbers going down, community spread relatively uncommon. Yeah know ""rushing develop vaccines"" vaccination rate ridiculously low amounts vaccines get. Dont know Taiwan SK also low rates, know received large bactges though   'anyone' getting blame, China - government created mess, purposefully spread abroad (allegedly) profited proliferation. absolute mania fear parents definitely helping. Yes, benefits go way beyond whether host city makes profit. 

The corruption companies get construction contracts, politicians get kickbacks contracts makes well worth it. /s

And Putin's Sochi Olympic Games 2014. Prior games, popular politician. fact many opposition members gaining popularity time Russia. worked incredibly hard get games,. Overspent building (to insure got proper kickbacks). importantly put together finest state-sponsored cheating system ever operate Olympics. majority Medals Russia, able rally fervor nationalistic pride brought approval ratings new highs solidify power base.

*Source ""Icarus"" documentary. They're roughly vaccinated UK (maybe more, forget).

Regardless know 'western' vaccines work variant (they do), can't lockdown forever - ALWAYS new covid variants, new covid variants every year. vaccinations help new variants, we'll deal get lives. Lockdown sustainable.  Turkish schools still closed stay indefinitely. school since 2020 March. good thing developed bnt completely agree - long short term ban stem rise Indian variant DE, I'm it. extra week current vaccination rate save lot lives.

Tbh - I'd also support closing internal borders, since internal borders really enforceable thing Europe, there's *much* point that. Australia New Zealand wait long can. much better rest world health economy. It‚Äôs brainer keep way.  please post source claim? teenager, idea friends doing.

 went somewhere bunch people long time, taking shoes taking shower get back good idea. looking globally? US‚Ä¶ wonder distributes. Well yes, countries actually doses. Exactly! Many adults fucked bc trauma went kids. grinds gears people say ‚Äúkids resilient‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôll fine‚Äù ‚Äî like seen adults society?? fucking won‚Äôt fine! It‚Äôs dismissive. Yeah, groceries alley never get host game again.

Given many games lose ton money ones make money could easily made carefully investing cost games stock market instead, make sound like bad thing.

List cities made lost money Wished state percentage. Looking Georgia. Also dumb fuck nephew lied getting vaccinated dad 73 yr old cancer survivor. I‚Äôm boat know feel üòû article Economist. Ridiculous you‚Äôve downvoted. people want protect children well themselves. Shouldn‚Äôt controversial. Go then. call Xi Jinping?   TBH smarter move might think. population thats holding COVID vaccination lottery ticket buying crowd basically completely overlapping circles venn diagram. stupid take.

Only need hide vaccinate 75%. reach appropriate amount vaccinated adults, let people negative test results. everything open stadiums full meantime, unlike everywhere else. teenager, extensive mental health issues multiple hospitalizations past year due pandemic, thank you. friends branded ‚Äúlazy‚Äù due school performance 100x even moreso pre-pandemic. Every single one friends, teens, mental health crisis covid. There‚Äôs second pandemic going around; psychological one.

Not alarmist, sound dramatic, kids REALLY OKAY HEAD right now. ""Insignificant"" similar words need actual numbers data attached them. experts saying ""I don‚Äôt think probably"". got vaccine...wtf Yet working they. kids need outdoor exercise red meat. greatest generation war, war lot suffered PTSD (not really treated seriously time) many refused talk saw horrific was.

The ""greatest generation"" moniker plaster hide toll took make whole affair tolerable (how many people fondly refer ""Blitz Spirit"" people War tough making something harrowing?)

Now disparaging people generation, went horrific admirable got ag all, let alone actually performed heroic deeds battlefield. no-one ho that, especially tools experience avoid trauma again.

So blithely say history repeats situation ignores context problems come trauma thought Japan sitting 70m doses?! terrible war, still costs American lives resources. see. sides waiting one another make move try use benefit use future negotiations. Maybe arguments articles containing stuff like ""decidedly uncommon"" ""I don‚Äôt think probably"" would greater success.  I‚Äôm hanging Top Gun II. could use little Maverick tough times.

BS policy's like make want shop places. Also glad cash thing catch big. useless BS IOC cancels Olympics, Japan hook IOC loss revenue made TV broadcast rights worldwide. Maybe get another Olympics 12 years make it. Japan cancels Olympics without IOC's approval, reimburse IOC loss revenue never get host game again. many nepalis work india returned pandemic india also open border lot incoming ongoing 2 countries. lockdown started nepal many indians coming nepal go gulf countries travel india banned many countries. add incompetent corrupt leaders care seat like many 3rd world countries. thankfully nepal get lot help neighbours countries. pour bag crisps resealable container, discard bag.

Same anything consumed single serving.

When microwave popcorn, pour serving bowl popping discard bag. Well I‚Äôm sure entities (IOC Japan) say taking place games, however one cancels probably one would left largest bill end day therefore one wants them. 

As far games themselves, honestly we‚Äôre pretty much June find waaaay late wake decide cancel. I‚Äôm gonna harsh towards Japanese authorities wth doing? months stockpiled vaccine deliveries coming Europe factories (and god knows else where) millions. Yet able vaccinate barely anyone. IOC. athletes delegations come vaccinated, much tourists (plus Japan set rules people coming assume set mandatory quarantine + test, etc). main issue Japanese population single digit % population received first dose vaccine (less 10mil people supposed received 70mil doses). Maybe feel like it! matters ...? Exactly!!! Sorry Reddit can‚Äôt convince people aren‚Äôt extremely gross! Hey I'm trying fit here. Gotta get people hyped vaccines know? .

CDC already said interview NPR expect localized community spread occur foreseeable future (next years) regardless measures taken. 

I'm opinion consider three points. 1) vulnerable members population highly vaccinated point. 2) developed better treatment options get need hospitalized hospital faster. 3) pretty soon everyone wants vaccine gotten it. 

I see way hold health measures keep businesses closed much longer. economic cost balanced public health benefits. agree masks low burden, even last another 6-12 months among adults. selfish, that's world.

An infected bat brought Wuhan. virology lab researching exact bat. 

I haven‚Äôt even gone RRAR cleavage site Covid-19 unique sense well.

The point isn‚Äôt convincing argument natural cause theory. It‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt dismissed outright genuine concern scientific community. 

For person infected Yunnan infect anyone Wuhan, that‚Äôd crazy. 

Your theory cave spelunker explored remote caves came contact Cave bat, contracted virus immediately isolated car drove 1100 miles without stopping city infecting single person got Wuhan. sleep, hotel rest, pit stop. straight cave Wuhan. 1000 mile trip, stopping. 

The lab leak theory Wuhan virology lab history lab failures bad precaution knowingly researching Coronaviruses exact bat Yunnan talking about. Therefore, investigations need made whether lab following precautions set place. 

That‚Äôs lab leak theory. theory could plausible, find truly case, lab leak requires serious inquiry. read anything covid actually body? I'm thinking not. friend mild case recovered. post infection blood clot caused covid killed her. mid 30s. Here's one sealioning. think noticed that.

But even cursory look shows ""extremely unlikely"" way cast idea unworthy investigation. 

Easily-googled example nutty idea dismissed using top-level U.S. science advisory panel concludes **extremely unlikely** brain ""organoids"" animal brains transplanted human neural cells experience humanlike consciousness pain anytime soon; panel's report calls current oversight bodies policies adequate.

That's way saying there's way could happen. mean don‚Äôt phone room? Wait states send back get allies? Georgia send directly korea via ups? It‚Äôs bit crazy kindergarteners could possibly considered ‚Äúgaps‚Äù learning begin with. formal content kindergarten irrelevant, main purpose kindergarten play kids, get used routines social structure school, etc.

There‚Äôs course nothing inherently wrong kids e.g. learning read basic arithmetic age 5‚Äì6, it‚Äôs means strictly necessary life success, necessarily better use time unstructured free play.

Similarly, IOC heeded lessons large sporting events. Many U.S.-based professional leagues, including National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association, Women‚Äôs National Basketball Association, conducted successful seasons, protocols rigorous informed understanding airborne transmission, asymptomatic spread, definition close contacts.2 Preventive measures, adapted amid continuous expert review, included single hotel rooms athletes, least daily testing, wearable technology monitoring contacts, supported rigorous contact tracing. Despite increasingly rigorous protocols, outbreaks Covid-19 caused multiple game cancellations.

February, Australian Open challenged hotel-driven exposures two local outbreaks. early May, Indian Premier League cricket tournament suspended third IOC‚Äôs playbooks1 built scientifically rigorous risk assessment, fail consider ways exposure occurs, factors contribute exposure, participants may highest risk. sure, athletes low risk serious health outcomes associated Covid-19, Paralympic athletes could higher-risk category. addition, believe playbooks adequately protect thousands people ‚Äî including trainers, volunteers, officials, transport hotel employees ‚Äî whose work ensures success large event.

See: Rules thee me. Nothing sad kids!!! /s Yes, exactly.

My personal opinion, though deeply unpopular, people don‚Äôt want kids home day (yes, get hard also work), loudest proponents ‚Äúkids mental health‚Äù pandemic upset little Johnny can‚Äôt play soccer year senior misses prom. saw one article claiming virtual learning ‚Äútrauma.‚Äù Um....that‚Äôs no. No, trauma. normal year, people vote funding schools, educator unions, health care, help women, etc. etc. topic comes up, can‚Äôt help roll eyes. people *truly* cared mental health kids, would funding resources would community priority MANY years ago.

That isn‚Äôt say kids aren‚Äôt struggling. someone working trenches everyday seeing kids surprisingly well. ones generally speaking kids need lot support regular year. Exactly. job closed less week year. birthday special day off, usually ends Sunday nothing open anyway. context -  fully vaccinated people there's nothing wrong going wherever want. I've going local gym without mask great. got two day delivery whatever box already isolated box good 30 hours least. Yes used strip leave clothes another room decontaminate whenever entered house didn‚Äôt know virus spread supposed touch cruise ship surface studies ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we've what, 4k stimulus money?

Sponsored Container Store would shocked allowed NZ. govt consistent strict hotel quarantine. takes single case slipping ruin everything worked for. zero natural immunity puts us huge risk. Taiwan's recent outbreak comes failure at-home quarantine. even trust pilots national airline abide rules. way we'd take risk.  One word: ""mull"".

So many new articles use word regarding government action good reason. Every decision over-thought, analysed. It‚Äôs difficult families separated long.  end day one remember fails.

The fact got vacines fast risky time extended dose meant got much faster.

When lockowj see Europe still struggling yeah. mean technically that's vaccines used be... small amounts virus hurt you. Covid year change long though winding down. one year life. That's nothing. I'm fully vaccinated. poking fin nowhere near point vaccination populace whole grande reopenings. Aerie changing rooms open! Waiting North West get old enough comment parents.  Good.

Absolute risk reduction (ARR) ‚Äì also called risk difference (RD) ‚Äì useful way presenting research results help ARR therefore amount therapy reduces risk bad

At least read [the press study defines advance ""endpoint"". Often track multiple endpoints (symptomatic case, hospitalization, death).

To make results comparable adult study, used endpoint, defined disease two COVID symptoms + positive PCR test 100% +/- lots effective definition.

They also evaluated alternate endpoint 1 symptom plus positive PCR test evaluated 93% effective *first* dose. Don‚Äôt care confused are.

Of course government leaders learn nothing past mistakes. Wild origin would *probably* true ignore literally circumstances around lab Wuhan, totally unique coronavirus research do, gain function research do, proximity epicenter, documented safety issues. like arguing Chernobyl disaster natural fluke totally disconnected smoking power plant (which, Soviets did, years). stand lose asking people continue masking certain circumstances? people got habit, became kind non-big-deal part everyday routine (like putting pants). Heck, see women wearing heels sometimes, way equally, uncomfortable wearing mask (although probably true all). say done bulk work, we? Children still mask due rigorous testing protocols vaccines, seems little bit unfair. well this, many people fully vaccinated full 2-3 week wait schedule? Probably good portion still window reach full protection. Now-- suggesting wear masks forever, providing counter point-- CDC announcement pretty unexpected, good majority public health experts previously expressed desire people continue wearing masks, particularly public places would exposed large number people. would that, eat banana peels? something similar. made lists every single thing use meds paper products cleaning supplies etc. stocked everything. literally afraid supply chains going break down. I'm last box tea bought March 2020, ha ha.

You say investigations warranted.

Remember idea initially emerged r1ghtwing deflection, trying divert blame America's abysmal pandemic response. Janssen like Danish version Johnson &amp; Johnson? 1.2% breakthrough cases died.

Now, keep mind possible large iceberg asymptomatic people never got tested. I've thinking second question lot. even go deciding appropriate punishment preventable pandemic killed millions? guess sanctions could imposed, would problematic due reach economy. teens don‚Äôt wanna take either.

You don‚Äôt want this. Like all. What's ideal time Pfizer doses? know makes small difference, remember seeing headline saying waiting longer minimum 3 weeks preferable virus survives weeks fridge temperatures, months freezer. decays days room temp. Genuine question haven‚Äôt read study:

How determine gets sick? Plenty people get Covid asymptomatic. testing everyone study covid regularly regardless whether symptoms? Otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt call 100% efficacy getting covid, would call 100% efficacy getting symptoms. 

I‚Äôve seen multiple media outlets portraying vaccination study results prevent people getting Covid entirely, instead vaccines preventing people getting seriously ill, it‚Äôs irresponsible reporting. Obviously vaccines good thing either way, public presented accurate information media responsibility so. 

I recently found vaccine studies researchers didn‚Äôt test study participants Covid regularly unless reported symptoms. provided public vaccine efficacy findings many media outlets media reported preventing Covid entirely. That‚Äôs shit journalism. I‚Äôm sure actual researchers‚Äô papers (fair disclosure: haven‚Äôt read papers vaccination results) actually represent findings accurately, public doesn‚Äôt understand part many media outlets aren‚Äôt reporting correctly, happens journalism reporting scientific findings pretty regularly begin with. See Twitter account ‚Äúin mice ‚Äúas pretty good example. never learn hard way, though? early days think everyone stupid shit know anything. Right lockdown went effect went got long refills prescriptions batteries kind stuff, took left home depot couple tarps realize autopiloted preparing fucking hurricane. Yeah, there's people thread saying still (and stop). shuddered thought can't even imagine repercussions concluded pandemic caused lab leak. could realistically see disruptive sanctions time. Fry thieves drive food lol thank you! seems like smart move.  cannot say whole country Delhi hospitals collapsed from.around 18 April around 7 May 20 days. enough beds oxygen positivity ratio fallen 95%.It seems obvious coronavirus peaked Delhi. vaccinated, Even catch Covid, won‚Äôt shedding enough spread others. dont think crappy cdc card count anything outside US. every state immunization registry info people got vaccinated. possible principle get something better less easy falsify.

Anyways, here's studies done. March 4 May 20, 2020, 1169 patients COVID-19 admitted 3 Italian Medicine wards. 12 patients (1%) suspected acute myocarditis; 5 (41.7%) men, mean age 76 (SD 11.34; median 78.5 years);""

Perhaps 50+ makes sense 65+ reading studies above. so? Wait, understand people investigating this. article came accused China (or entity) without great deal proof, problematic. long discussion unbiased based fact, info better. 

Now next question is, happens way prove came lab (again, speculation probably impossible prove point)? Would demand reparations? think result something like would stricter rules labs/testing/viruses. again, would actively enforce it?

I'm pro mask generally pro idea lockdowns needed (especially last winter). also recognize vaccines amazing completely change risk assessment. There's scientific evidence came lab. apparently US intelligence report. know US intelligent always 100% correct. That's American invasion Iraq failed onslaught chemical, biological nuclear attacks Saddam Hussein's invisible WMD program. I'm down.

The flu deadly virus also, scared around people workplace flu seasons? isnt wrong SSRI withdrawal comparable.

Heroin also artificial harms drug (that say controlled quality, dose, RoA, anywhere near destructive unpredictable may think. FFS still prescribed huge portion world). lies EU.

Yeah, that's point. lot infectious diseases follow seasonal pattern, pattern world. Influenza goes away summer northern latitudes, behaviour closer equator. still know exact mechanisms behind phenomenon, surely temperature.

Perception warped all... I've watched 3 friends (come SSRIs, heroin). Guess helped symptoms... cannabis! Sorry offend you. delivered cost. Feel free play again. produce vaccines inability deliver timeline could subject damages far excess revenues

I‚Äôm arguing merits either side (I haven‚Äôt read contract know details) noting economics make sense sides  AZ committed exact number doses. goal, like Sanofi goal making effective vaccine. AZ may 100% successful meeting goal, least 0% successful. AZ ""noble intention"". Oxford University invented vaccine, would give AZ AZ agreed sell cost. ""noble"" ones Oxford University. 

[[Oxford University also got bullied Tories cancel previous agreement another manufacturer partner AZ instead, whatever reason.]]

AZ (who never made vaccine before) agreed non-profit-deal thought would free advertisment company. also means (on top zero expertise vaccine market) clearly intention putting much money effort production process. whole non-profit angle comes back bites everone butt, one source current mismanagement company.

BTW, AZ's accounts show managed make profit 250 million dollars supposedly non-profit vaccine first quarter alone. Ironically, posted sub full people whose fear virus lead this. #1 restriction negatively impacts children school closure. could‚Äôve kept restrictions place making in-person learning last shut down.

Children‚Äîwith exception small minority extremely immunocompromised children‚Äîhave never risk COVID. flu poses risk kids. never reason children afraid go store. could understand child would afraid despite low odds: adults lives capitulated mass-hysteria didn‚Äôt give proper guidance.

People also love bring example children traumatized losing parents. risk also insanely low, especially young children. 80% deaths occur people 65, 20% skewed pretty close 65. kids lose anyone, would grandparents great-grandparents. sad is, it‚Äôs expected lose grandparents childhood. March, less 20% Americans knew someone died COVID. I‚Äôd bet among younger people, number much lower. mass-trauma death doesn‚Äôt seem much basis.

So no, I‚Äôd argue mental repercussions year lost school worse anything COVID would inflicted kids. say *nobody* ready. lot people even know healing option. Remindme! 30 days Steph Curry also born Ohio he's younger build culture based around idea punishment, simply shrug shoulders say, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs gods will‚Äù forget greed wealth hoarding destroying souls, leaving us bereft god. there, tests treatment mostly free, might little different?

Wait, Covid tests cost money US? guess never thought that. Yeah. shit. Lock downs ok know dealing afterwards knew affect kids much. Kids class. adults fight among children quietly suffer background. world needs priority adjustment. NY giving away 50 full scholarships public university NY 12-17 get shot. seems like solid reward  ePHI naming medication? No. 

If way correlate named medication someone particular taking it, would violate HIPPA. Giving general info statistics related client populations? you‚Äôre good. Lmfao fact comparing SSRIs heroin goes show warped perception is. Contracts seem quarters theoretically J&amp;J could drop rest June 30th breach. 28% order expected Q2 begin with. effective, 0.01% figure doubtful, since vaccinated ppl exposed virus. better stat would people exposed vs people infected(although impractical) main purpose kindergarten play kids, get used routines social structure school, etc.

These learned skills. kids kept school learning things, would learning gap? test people close contact, test people symptoms, catch cases.

Maybe bit different there, strongly suspect relatively people symptoms seek testing care. figure people, milk, seek treatment get ill well-insured.

Up there, tests treatment mostly free, might little Recently rapid testing schools here, came similar results... using random sampling basically waste, produced low numbers... Covid rampant schools recently.

Yeah, know states sampling-style testing schools found infection rates pretty much representative public large. words, schools really super-spreaders everyone thought would be. Woah.

Using alcohol cope never positive outcome. Using weed cope like drinking coffee wake book. guess course . ...please read post one time ... around end :) Right, again, talking millions people got vaccinated soon could (or close it).

Pfizer sell cost developing countries. main problem storage requirements, stored fridges vaccine gotten much broader appeal. also pretty good research cannabis age 25 inhibit brain development, no? Honor system current employees, new employees allowed office unvaccinated. Everyone work educated, I'm concerned anti-vaxxers liars slightest. Maybe address concerns then?

Problem is, GOP continued base supporters demonstrated care kids getting killed school shootings, care climate change, care accelerating concentration wealth opportunities wealthiest segment population, fact seem hell bent making problems even worse.


Kids smart enough informed enough realize they're getting left global-scale dumpster fire best-case scenario. hopefully great news. Single-dose vaccines key getting immunity among under-served people countries. Yes, exactly. hate kind misleading headline result. makes sound like vaccines 99.99% effective, absolutely not. vaccines amazing, definitely get one, 95% effective (for mRNA vaccines Pfizer/Moderna), also similar amount protection hospitalization death case get sick.

What they've done calculate number vaccinated people getting Covid diagnoses divided number vaccinations. Sure, incredibly easy make calculation, calculation tell effectiveness! depends rate infections, even comparison rate unvaccinated people getting sick. Furthermore, would even rigorous result compare unvaccinated/vaccinated rate exactly -- even done -- populations unvaccinated/vaccinated differ considerably demographics. butt hurt gaslighting I‚Äôve ever seen it. You‚Äôre clearly butt hurt one. Given pandemic going year, 20% vaccinated explain people 69 make majority deceased citizens?  Wisconsin. always said normality won‚Äôt on/off switch, almost feels way! Vaccinated people quickly starting move on. Love see it! really, artifical creation part. Another thing people don‚Äôt small children don‚Äôt realize WAVE speech delays. Speech pathologists booked months advance.

When toddlers don‚Äôt anyone parents listen to, one parent always working home switch off, kid functionally one person learn language from. don‚Äôt hear much cross talk conversation, don‚Äôt hear different voices ways expressing. masks, can‚Äôt see mouths model shaping sounds.

Everyone age group depressed anxious well. witnessed 9/11 t.v. spent elementary school years bush administration ongoing war. middle school years great recession, family nearly became homeless(we pretty poor first place).

Now I'm mid 20s look we're at. future looks gloomy, whole American life non stop climb/struggle lol. feel generation. CO also giving scholarships. honor system enforce somehow? kind company industry don‚Äôt mind asking said vaccinated people could still contract spread virus there‚Äôs lot people never believe anything else. Nuance exist. Surely cause significant sociological issue. Even true would still worth getting. believe Germany examined dismissed theory designed virus. thought natural virus escaped containment still potential one though.

basically, see nasty virus, go examine lab, someone fucks gets environment. would explain pattern infection surrounded lab Wuhan. ""All adverse events excluded""

This test spot Propaganda headline achieved, right?!?! Really? want know maybe send kids school, even symptoms? maybe let person work next know, get tested too?

This sounds really irresponsible (unless seen people couple weeks Covid). I‚Äôm blessed near 2 awesome drive ins. They‚Äôre awesome experiences. Terrible shit happened throughout human history - exposed way social media. one point say got news exclusively social media?

Even get news exclusively social media, social media internet 100% influenced current state journalism. News slowly merging entertainment even use all?

You're literally reddit right lol say r/europe.

Children need see peers develop properly.  worries‚Äîsome people fact stuff like that! read article, I'm hoping dispel confusion it.

So article claims 0.1% fully vaccinated individuals actually get infected. However, mind, people get tested vaccinated probably people likely symptomatic right?

How study account majority vaccinated people never tested simply develop symptoms due vaccine? Exactly. ex friend believed controlled infections way go dealing covid. stopped talking that. Covid vaccine? work forever take every year?  Yup! Although reach 70% population &lt;12 year olds eligible, hard see slowing down. Assuming get 75-80% summer, plenty achieve localized herd immunity (remember Israel whole 60%) Don‚Äôt forget Texas Rangers opening day crowd surge Anecdotal, took flights. Everyone wear mask plane, although people pulling noses. airport itself, there‚Äôs still requirement, like 25% people either weren‚Äôt wearing wearing chin diapers.

People restrictions restrictions over. course did.   think Americans foot bill hospitalizations unvaccinated every one chance get vaccine. always variants future vaccines/booster shots take account. like seasonal flu shot years.   want see State (or US state) may ""hiding"" COVID deaths look Deaths - Causes Excess Death counts.

I think conflating medical understanding public relations. Guess one ‚Äúlucky‚Äù ones odds even 80 year old dying within given, 2 week, 4 week, whatever period use, actually still quite low

And would died anyways (ie, died covid), would accounted normal death rate. So, excess death first place. headlines scary, trust math. encouraged adult daughter get J&amp;J vaccine type person would find difficult make Jab #2. fine. really need single-dose vaccines population vaccine hesitant good health resources.

Governments levels pretty passive know deal bad news. That's ridiculous. honestly think people died random shit people staying home, far less, distancing people? Excess deaths almost entirely attributable COVID. bullshit excuses like suicides going easily countered lower flu deaths like.  Given supreme efforts Trump Co. poured downplaying virus, think true. travel shut partial, targeted Chinese citizens IIRC. quarantining questioning anyone came directly China time - basically action Trump took spent next year constantly writing dangers downplaying virus.

If knowing sooner could saved lives, Trump Trump would saved many, many more.

That's much higher .01%.

What exactly trying accomplish comparing two numbers? testing pretty much free, wait times non existent, people hesitant han ever get tested.
Why?
1st foremost (in USA) CDC removed guidance masks(in places) gives people feeling safety comfort. need even think covid (for many people)
2nd feel like getting trip stuck nose.

Now real problem number 2 is, even someone get tested positive covid, self isolate simply say ""oh well I'm going dash Costco pickup things
 really feel bad headache hot air-conditioned car?""

Yes vaccinated people certain level protection, unvaccinated, bigger problem.

I think testing needs continue least monthly tests hospital employees. Yea. never understand CDCs position this. totally contrary *everything* know vaccine is, does, works. 

Their position regards ""Even though vaccinated still wear mask"" massive mistake. sent message believe effectiveness even though testing proved ~97% effective.

In addition, served disincentive on-the-fence regarding getting vaccinated. resulted slower necessary vaccination rate. 

I know this. *extremely* conservative want wrong. think considered downside approach. Sorry hear :/ I'm sure die young (because preventable disease) balance increased cost medical care survivors.

I understand works, know right results exam, moment I'm comfortable results makes sense ""everyone 40 eligble"" rather ""everyone 41 ineligble"" Maybe don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking about, keep quiet.  also like hear Albany capital California. got J&amp;J vaccine, got covid. It‚Äôs effective vaccines, time took could get. I‚Äôd recommend getting one vaccines choice! less technology fast SARS-CoV2 coronavirus mutates compared influenza viruses. influenza viruses mutate quickly. One right things government probably effort deserving huge credit.

Only brits really like cheer on. rest knows failing company sees one. obviously haven‚Äôt read Nicholas Wade‚Äôs piece GoF research lab. isn‚Äôt nut jobs saying could manufactured. wasn‚Äôt given full access records weeks. report origins next useless.  percentage infected people groups ""unvaccinated"" individuals. 1%, 0.1%. 5%? period?

Data analysis always needs control groups.

For example period December-January 0.001% people got Covid South Korea. mean 0.001% people get covid.

note, denying vaccines work. do. CDC better job data presentation winning skeptics. study limitations, also, similar study vaccinated people? Maybe results.

I'm ""conspiranoic"", trust safety drug short time testing.    wondering well April approx 50m UK 350m else where.

Again false. AZ cannot claim SII numbers since cannot provide vaccines make someone else production partners US, Mexico, Argentina, UK, EU, India, Australia probably more

They destroyed [15 millions baltimore forced give site JJ. contractor hey, seem mind differ appart.

They delivered significant numbers neither Mexico looks U.S. help AstraZeneca admits Latin American vaccine struggling behind-schedule local AstraZeneca production shortfalls deliveries foreign suppliers asked United States help vaccines. read request addition 2.7 million AstraZeneca doses Washington sent Mexico March.

&amp;#x200B;

The UK got enough doses end hospitalisations vaccinate ages 44-40. country able AZ. UK population 66 millions got 50 million doses (out 100 million doses). enough make dent hospitalisation numbers. 

Compare EU ordered 300 million gotten 53 million far.

&amp;#x200B;

Australia berley recieved 2 million 8 million doses. came EU sites. begin production [54 million AZ yet start.

Everyone crying ""transparency"", one could elaborate transparent investigators last mission. politics, science. 

How anyone work regime putting politics ahead science dealing pandemic, cost hundreds thousands peoples' lives? Every time people (usually people without kids) scream parents want schools reopen 'can't stand around kids' want wave face. Like, no, assholes, children miserable isolation. back school hours week changed lives. Fun fact Liz born battalion command shitter. Like backwards Athena emerged fully formed father's ass. like, yes, children's school hysterical kindergartner big 'gaps' really apply. fine getting year mentally stable, school putting ton pressure 'catch up'. Although I've always landed squarely side ""more caution better"" regard covid, I've saying along wary ""opposite"" relationship mental physical impacts ordeal. 

We learned early virus overwhelmingly damages kills older people. physical health impact heaviest top end population age, diminishes go younger, gradually first sharply cross like 50 years old. Pretty much whole world reacted strongly quickly protect vulnerable people, took unprecedented severely expensive measures so. 

But always felt like invisible side coin downplayed or, people, even directly trivialized ignored - mental impact. seems fall almost exactly opposite physical impact; heaviest youngest people (school aged kids), gradually diminishes across early adulthood, probably sharply drops around maybe 40s 50s. ~150 million young Americans losing year school young adult lives incredibly steep price pay. early years life vital become (social mental development kids, career relationship development young people) compared later years people tend lot settled. 

This better discussed throughout whole past year, least could ready end try address problems going have, like one. personally find completely absurd people still want restrictions continue protect ever-safer group morons (anti-vax) super-low-risk (children) individuals. free harmless upend society culture way past year. terrible, terrible price. lot schools reopened, many cases close cases. school closed reopened several times now. like hand soap sudden hard find. I‚Äôm pretty sure part hoarding, part bunch people buying hand soap first time. see, well guess I'll wait 5-6 weeks. I'd rather extra protection sooner since I'm sure we'll boosters stuff line sound like husband. First thing (and always done) gets home work strip boxers stay way. man loathes clothes. Unlikely while. took years researchers came better estimates number infected people deaths h1n1 (they estimated roughly 15x higher global death numbers reported). 

We really (and shouldn't) focus primarily data we're still middle pandemic we're still likely see outbreaks. Totally. whole pandemic varying levels crazy, first months, whoa man. googling bit, looks like determined *US v. Hamilton (2012)* illegal wear US military uniform authorized intent deceive. they'd prove intent quite difficult, yes appears would.be law case. Honestly mind sanitation-theatre practices stick around. always good keep things clean disinfect occasionally, pandemic not. general public disgusting. kids young, close loved one immunocompromised received vaccine didn‚Äôt develop antibodies. 

The pandemic Covid like small pox, measles chicken pox.  I'll also add animal models suggest infected COVID mouth likely mild inhalation.

In study hamsters, full dose covid administered orally produced asymptomatic infections compared nasal spray resulted severe refund call protein blocks, tail end passengers eat them. tried imply ""as long can."" reach near herd immunity, dangerous reopen borders. wonder real numbers like would 100% go court. Alright, winter people gonna start wearing masks realized nice get sick entire year. see people wearing masks, here's do: Nothing. Leave hell alone carry life. several orders magnitude worse Chernobyl. closer accidental nuclear explosion medium-sized city: millions dead, many trillions dollars wasted. came lab, measure would nearly free compared harm caused.

If there's non-zero chance came lab, virologists science general need get ahead it. Talk even possibility escape unacceptable, cost completely prevent going forward, including personal costs like automatic on-site quarantines experiments. Nuclear science learned hard way happens condescendingly say control not. humans known contacted Covid-19 Wuhan Yunnan(where bat found).

I think convincing argument either way:

a. reliable bat covid sampling? (To feels missing covid Wuhan province Yunnan Wuhan definitely fairly possible)

b. infected bat (or intermediate host) could brought Wuhan

c. Patient 0 could traveled Wuhan right getting infected, passing disease others never noticing anything...

In either scenarios would people affected Yunnan   [This came year ago. Real world data [191 came last October.

Optimizing requires going much bigger search space finding something works well enough.  

From community perspective, vaccine short supply, longer waiting time doses benefits everyone means people get first dose sooner.

From individual perspective, longer waiting time may produce stronger immunity, consider current pandemic trajectory places - community spread rapidly dropping; medium-strength immunity ~3 weeks might valuable super-strong ~3 months.

This preprint reports interval 12 weeks people age 80 produces 3.5x higher antibody response 3.6x lower cellular immune response vs US stock 3-week really good writing author intended interpreted ways. article answer second question.

You seem mixing COVID 19 SARS. really mentioned two things here, they're part it. Perhaps biggest parts it.

Over years, I've slowly come conclusion human beings need something fulfils role religion. traditional religion, they'll take another set values beliefs treat one. Politics science easily fill role. course, try force science religion, stops science, science putting theories test changing beliefs presented new information.

And course, lot people, way affirming place world correctness tribe identify with. someone comes slightly uptight suburb backwards small town, like parents, fairly well academic aspects school social ones, often end attitudes identified. ""Science"" (not actual science, idealised concept it) becomes thing gives comfort they're right people dislike wrong. Funnily enough, another role religion traditionally filled many people. 2/3 cases found greater Taipei region. plans initiate lockdown Taipei and/or travel restrictions Taipei rest island try tamp outbreak?

We‚Äôve never super worried outdoor spread either ask kids wear masks required since they‚Äôre young. that‚Äôs pretty much plan right now, cases looking better better sure.

I typed say: severe issues like this, imagine people even serious stressors dealt with. think many people suffering silence sucks. story leading headlines around world. wish would also included estimates excess death based measures mortuary records, burial/cremation rates etc. recall reading values indicating death rates least 10x official numbers, lines Times' ""Worse Case"" estimate, closer 4M dead. acceptable strategy **vaccine**

What lockdowns? Masks? Social friends get vaccinated eligible, wait vaccines way yourself, friends, country

To clear: agree this. ... disagree that? Interestingly I‚Äôve heard anecdotes breakthrough cases vaccinated people generally don‚Äôt involve coughing. least light coughing part it. 

Generally it‚Äôs flu like fever chills general malaise. good know he‚Äôs likely even hallmark cough happen him.  Nah man see can't even read, say listen me? I'm saying need listen read recent articles kind developing knowledge, experts. know conspiracy theories born? Exactly like trying push outdated article 'evidence'. 

Hell, try call professor right he'll tell unnecesarily cleaning groceries. 

Give another example: Multiple experts (just like chair infectious diseases is) said masks ineffective stopping transmission therefor unnecessary. Guess many still say today? Answer few, they've accepted research done past year know better. example would still quoting favorite chair. Political leaning definitely correlates vaccine enthusiasm, it‚Äôs much weaker one class. Basically richer better educated people likely get vax less privileged people. 

This especially obvious dig county level. Hunterdon County, NJ example nearly 60% adults *fully* vaccinated (so obv even one shot). Bronx county NYC around 40%. Hunterdon voted Trump 60-40, Bronx Biden 90-10. It‚Äôs (or even mostly) politics.  scared death like us. no: fool anyone. time let go **get vaccinated** instead. learn hiding fear actually insane. Judging comment history can‚Äôt decide hate white people kore Asian women  strong reaction first dose 3 months post covid infection. Fever, headache, pretty major fatigue. Bad nausea think got stomach flu day. Fun. sarcasm

Domestic Covid cases covered almost like terrorist attacks, lot people fairly parochial begin with, suspect even mass vaccinations make Covid kill less flu (it looks like will), government loath open border risk extremely low - well beyond we'd non-Covid cause death.  think isolate long deem adequate. populations say enough.

Not long go lockdown quickly enough strict enough. August outbreak NZ virus already circulating 2 weeks densely populated economically deprived area country. still managed shut contact tracing 17 day city-wide lockdown. 

Since systems improved, number positive cases quarantine border workforce 100% vaccinated. there. much less risk before. still enough we've seen Melbourne.

The system working meant Melbourne. cases far linked. Contact tracing overwhelmed yet. find spread next 24 hours, they'll likely move lockdown.

I‚Äôm concerned egregious way Americans mislead lied February 2020, told don‚Äôt much anything worry about, virus already gone firm foothold rapid-fire spread.

Maybe announcing early saying ‚Äúby x date‚Äù would better approach. Please stop excessive sanitizing hands schools. usally bad parents leading outcomes. time year (graduation) brings back great memories even though graduated high school almost 35 years ago. really saddens concerns peers able experience time life worked anticipated years! Please hang head remember even though access them, feeling you. wish solution..... eye test time! Man feel really bad Australians. hope ramp vaccinations soon, start withdrawing snap protocols. Same. mean honestly I‚Äôd happy attach vaccination records passport way would eventually streamline process. see testing required least next 6 months next year.

There's need spray world disinfectant.

Some people like live fairy tales. lot times though really want best simply truly understand history. I‚Äôm sorry hear this. daughter admitted crisis year ago (not pandemic related all)...as one parents want say surprised beyond belief ever found situation. household loving supportive ... kids still hit low lows sometimes. professionals around us calm neutral understanding, helped tremendously us absolutely unfathomable situation. people become straight mentally ill covid prevention. EU give shit poorer countries getting vaccine. did, spent months undermining calling ""quasi-ineffective"" etc, knowing full well countries going convince populations take line. politics.

I don‚Äôt think comprehend effect leader like Donny last four years people, especially children.

We‚Äôre normalized it‚Äôs really fucking significant. Read article, says verdict expected next month. everyone followed guidelines CDC suggested everyone feel perfectly safe, yes. know might help?

Letting go back fuck school see friends...get fucking vaccines approved know safe dragging feet reason.  Yeah, generation really depressed. don‚Äôt know diagnosis rates higher us generations, matter go feels like sense apathy. Obviously that‚Äôs generalizing, there‚Äôs much depressing shit going world, we‚Äôre still expected always good mood school get perfect grades?

Really, main thing past years, lot people generation‚Äôs outlook gone hopeful, ‚Äúwe change‚Äù attitude apathetic, ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs listening‚Äù view. That‚Äôs vibe get, anyways. We‚Äôve put much effort energy making positive change future, world ‚Äúleaders‚Äù treat us bunch dumb teenagers. Nobody‚Äôs listening. supposed care future might even get change doesn‚Äôt happen *now*?

At point, mostly vent post me, want give one perspective say hospital absolutely right: we‚Äôre exhausted. Source?

[Terms here. Seems set 20 million doses end June deadline, doses, HAAAAA Living event ""surviving"" never much danger.

I ""survive 9/11"" alive happened, risk low non-existent.

Face facts: many kids died covid...we help survive...we help older vulnerable people survive. assume talking US different countries.

Here Canada seeing cases drop significantly right provinces due vaccination efforts ramping considerably last month. Ontario govt made decision there's currently ongoing debate schools - whether worth opening not. best high schoolers would get like 2 weeks school elementary would get 3, teachers vaccinated yet. vacccine acception rate
62.1% Japan (March),
65% US (February)

In europe often even 50% last year, availability rose many decided get vaccination anyways. Meaning, acceptance rises availability Overpopulated sense that, least developed countries, many people materialist culture makes way life unsustainable.

Its pipe dream hope unanimous change, desperately need learn moderation lives, species' greed food need starving people Username checks out. cost lockdowns. Sure, saved grandma sacrificed kids it. 

I‚Äôm hyperbolic, repercussions lockdowns outlast physical effects Covid. Suicides, mental health issues, depression, delays learning, kids living paranoia fear... That‚Äôs even including effects poverty. 

Some people trying talk cost lockdowns entire time, they‚Äôve getting banned silenced. hey, mental health development one ‚Äúscience‚Äù didn‚Äôt give shit last year. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs finally ok talk it. referring specifically trending section. Musicians lyrics drugs, shooting, sex, taking bathes blood. Fake family vlogs utter nonsense gives false expectations. formula shows similar kardashians like shoes. correct kids watch questionable content don‚Äôt know better parents idea kids watching long keeps quiet still. someone spent pandemic UK US, corroborate this. Masks appeared earlier people committed wearing them, especially outside. 

The US big place though, live small corner (New England).

*Here  forgetting pretty much human history, even though people deal shit things, parents able raise children cornerstone right. 

Now families even get that. Children raised daycare workers teachers parents go work. Think child's development. 

Fun fact, actually protections puppies children comes child care. illegal separate puppy mother prior 8 weeks, know incredibly detrimental development puppy. Yet humans, US gives exactly 0 days maternity leave. people wonder children increasing levels mental health issues. daycare worker replace mother father.  I've never asked people continue put lives hold.

I'm stating there's lot misinformation anti-vaxxers actually are, effect mental health. Same. young family member likely advised take vaccine due previous negative reaction. always lifestyle choice. important part statement 'feel safe'. unvaccinated wear masks still spread vaccinated guaranteed 100% protection. Y'all bitches need video games. criticism towards people need incentive get vaccinated Honestly? Ask teachers knew. watching kids slowly burn course school year breaks heart. hope able recharge little summer. People can‚Äôt trusted quarantine home. tried get people March 2020, asked people isolate home returned anywhere. end impose lockdown instead. I'm unsure feel this. believe choice think anything medical done without parents knowing. side effects, albeit rare, parent know might go unaddressed. teachers trouble getting us talk

I'm sure old certain amount teenagerdom honest. However I'm 100% sure exacerbated social media pandemic.

Big popular social media (Facebook) really started high school, early raging beast today. kind all-consuming grade 11 way (because novel thing everybody wanted talk person, importantly smartphones come high school).

But students still close bit high school become introspective anyway, think, regardless social media. start actually think fit world - terms friend groups, cliques, fields work, version education system destined (trade school, college, university, perhaps none above).

Having said think really important resources kids right now. say social media escape teens -- think anymore, especially COVID. many, social media *is* life now, real human interaction escape. crushingly depressing. Fall 2019 would impressive still right ask others continue put lives hold severe reaction, vast minority vaccination outcomes.

If we're trying maximize health people, need going back normal questions asked. back 2019 early 2020, gym rat. Loved going gym lost lot weight it. also first time gotten sick much adult life. definitely blamed gym capacity people wipe also touch face, phones etc wash hands. gym almost year stick at-home weights bit longer suspect public relations side would problematic: controversial best, generate negative backlash worst. doubt US UK want want take kind risk. what‚Äôs wrong them? acting like that‚Äôs getting admitted? Worth noting covid also made social media worse. cant think many worse ways fuck teenagers mental health locked home 24/7 parents whole time, coupled fact way engage peers social media people trying talk cost lockdowns entire time, they‚Äôve banned silenced. 

This cost lockdowns. Sure, saved grandma sacrificed kids it. 

I‚Äôm hyperbolic, repercussions lockdowns outlast physical effects Covid. 10 euros times 200m doses times 100 days would equal ‚Ç¨200b AZ's revenues tenth that. cripple wipe out. expect court give anywhere near that. CDC assuming unvaccinated continue wear masks. public feel way go gym grocery store? court case takes least five years, ten, final decision reached cannot overturned anymore. then, China selling vector vaccines similar price AZ anyways. flu deadly covid kids. let kids 2020 implicitly think level child death acceptable. 

Many times amount kids die car accidents. Yet i'm sure kids car walk near cars sometimes. 

We accept loss life. Well paid rat piss, damn it. Europe also saying Australians perspective isolation sitting golden cage.

Yeah, AU NZ open let virus (in winter btw) known consequences... 

They delusional psychotic. shitshow Europe, lockdowns lockdowns, masks, insane rules, million deaths, poverty, economic downturn, school closures, widespread psychological problems, etc, etc, etc. nerve criticize Australia (and New Zealand) opening up. Give'em finger. there's quite countries gone strategy pretty much major outbreak sooner later. Mongolia Cambodia name two.

Of countries world, zero-covid strategy few. China, Mongolia, Taiwan, SE Asia, Australia NZ Pacific Islands. 

Mongolia SE Asia systems fail, within last month so. failure they're developing nations without enough testing capacity difficult control borders. one SE Asian country failed, stopped spreading others. 

Only Taiwan, Australia NZ wealth isolation completely keep Covid out. three countries category country could hope in. need wealth provide economic support people make lockdowns effective. need total border control prevent undocumented migration bringing in. quite funny claim given good system worked far. guess I'll saying thing Nz's system ever happens face major outbreak (I hope cannot ruled out).

Their system worked well before, transmissible variants game changer. require catching leakages even earlier locking harder. Since beginning NZ we've told daily basis key good testing numbers maintain elimination. shocking seeing Taiwan severely limit testing lowest testing rate developed world. They've tested 25,000/million NZ done 400,000/million. factually wrong, there's also countries managed manage covid without experiencing massive waves also without ever lockdowns. See Korea.

Elimination best approach economy lifestyle. every country like South Korea 40 went mitigation/suppression ended big waves. guess Melbourne's experience showed weaknesses Australia's system subpar contract tracing, then?

There Australian system. Every state totally different strategy, 2020. page, though still differences. NSW continues favour much looser approach relying contact tracing less lockdowns. Western Australia Queensland lockdown drop hat. 

But I'm defend Australia gold standard. I'm NZ there's lot Australia's approach find confusing stupid. part held months opening bubble lot Kiwis still like it. mean, pretty big dip, quick one  all. really tried keep things normal possible. kids spend lot time in-laws super paranoid general. also got sick Covid didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt keep secret kids. Plus still required wear masks school it‚Äôs really ingrained them. Luckily he‚Äôs comfortable going maskless playing baseball. refused make wear one playing outside. problem took drastic action before, people want us keep taking drastic action now.

A line needs drawn here. People need going back normal, kicking screaming need be, overall cost worse cost virus. article lays happens try reach zero. Children coming ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. 

There living alive. Yes know. see, kids get flu shots every year. effective covid shot, far ever gotten flu.

I live Louisiana, one worst covid vaccination rates. means greater likelihood teacher another child bringing covid school.

See first article: ""Reducing transmission schools shared responsibility. combination effective prevention strategies (including consistent correct¬†use masks;¬†physical distancing;¬†handwashing respiratory etiquette;¬†cleaning¬†and maintaining healthy facilities;¬†and¬†contact tracing¬†in combination with¬†isolation¬†and¬†quarantine) implemented strict adherence limit transmission school setting.""? Physical distancing happen vast majority kids back person, kid's school old ventilation system, handwashing already lessened considerably since beginning year, ""respiratory etiquette"" among 5 year olds... hilarious, cleaning hopefully still done well. Oh masks required.

From second article: ""It noteworthy among reported pediatric deaths, 80% children fully vaccinated."" That's flu. since kids always fully vaccinated, shows much less likely chance dying flu. They're less likely get all, do, less likely severe case. article also gave range kids die flu season.. 100s-300s. 200s kids died US covid. know longer period time, rate still pretty close. proven information third article.

So see getting here, please see perspective. able get kids flu shot. worry much flu. able get kids covid shot. still worried covid. Reversing mask mandate bad idea CDC said masks remain schools bc kids vaccinated. past, children survived wars famines.

Today, can't survive year home parents. Yes, thousand million times, yes. CDC white house said so, straight enormous teams leading scientists public health professionals. According CDC, yes. comes definition safe. One year long especially live country. people travel overseas year normally. discussed half people subreddit adamant wanting social distancing continue. care, even though constantly say ""care others"" absolutely disgusting calling point.  Mental health resilience mix. mental health, want make improvements grow, revert back stasis, definition resilience. low baseline, one mentally resilient *and* poor mental health.

Also, childhood trauma basis almost maladaptive adult behaviors. shit sticks us forever. way around, lol. I‚Äôm 30s wrote year 60s! district removing mask mandate kids next year can‚Äôt wait. It‚Äôs unnatural eat lunch partisan other. worst part trying bring dismissed anti-masker anti-vaccine person, especially, people kids.

Listen, also kids, recognize large portion current generation kids fucked social disruption caused Coronavirus deal society years come. contamination OCD I've always observant people's hygiene. 1 woman department saw wash hands correctly restroom. would eat food brought her. People gross. early March 2020 group lunch. told everyone wash hands grabbing food, eat laughed like joke. aware *all* manufacturers also faced significant delays deliveries rollout? Everyone knows taking breaks (especially outdoors) actually improves classroom focus performance. lady sounds like awful teacher, I'm sorry daughter misfortune student year. It‚Äôs unpopular going take extra steps prevent unnecessary screen time child. want focus live, interactive learning young, entering school. know get harder they‚Äôre school. Don‚Äôt know going handle yet, make specific hours ‚Äúscreen time‚Äù hours make sure interact nights weekends. It‚Äôs one modern parenting challenges.  Aside outright abuse, purposefully ignoring child absolute worst thing parent, especially young kids. Yeah lot people holding Japanese vaccine? Dirt, grime, germs everyday reality lived fine. Yes. carefully avoided poke topic. countries healthcare temple Mammon, complete human sacrifice. Plus wanted weaponize COVID 19 2015 apparently speak situation work old school investment management company. I'm talking shirts / suits ties everyday. working remotely year we're never going back full time office, always hybrid. Yep come couple days week, split working home office 10000x better, plus fucking ties. Yes, Trump power want use phrase ""airborne"" pandemic inconvenient electorally. CDC update use phrasing April 30. People dying 3 months, tell us facts. definitely need held accountable.. move manufacturing companies.. something. get main UK news reddit skewed. Reddit thinking Johnson would lose election handily instead party won, kind mandate. Reddit vocal Johnson hate get feeling pretty touch happening ground UK. Honestly, Trump. Reddit would think Trump widely loathed US yet picked 46% vote election he's clearly hated. imagine election held reddit % would probably single digits. contextualize this: Belgium bought 5,160,000 doses vaccine. today, 142,800 2.77% delivered. J&amp;J massively behind schedule EU deliveries, even 2.4 million doses get clearance use end week. public ones hybrid remote person year back fully person next school year. poor high school seniors missed person graduation ceremony last year neighborhood parade them. person one year though. home room teacher frequently takes away recess entire class due excessive talking students.

Beatings continue morale improves. 46% Hawaii's population fully vaccinated, 65% received least one dose, 23 cases yesterday. would say they've point needed grand reopenings weeks. entire time rhetoric ‚Äúeven saves one life‚Äù. in, don‚Äôt even want talk costs lockdowns save grandma. Well turns real cost line thinking insanely stupid along, guess it‚Äôs safe talk it. 

A lot trauma kids unnecessary. encouraging parents lock kids separate rooms quarantine disease poses virtually threat them. child abuse. 

We allowed discuss costs lockdowns entire year, personally comments downvoted removed talking costs associated lockdowns. put children‚Äôs well ‚Äúnot allowed to‚Äù worrying catching cold. 20 years United States packed full exponentially anxious, disillusioned, disenfranchised, impoverished people today.

You think things bad now? Wait kids grow spent entire lives stuck inside surreal unsustainable bubble constant fear, inflammation, identity confusion.

This generational crisis waiting happen. Vietnam foot step across China places. think one thing shown (and eagle eyed hindsight that), hard quick lockdowns probably better economic recovery. country earth island successful that. Even Taiwan new outbreak week. anyone tried telling grow they‚Äôll get spend rest life working college debt?

That would millennials. think zoomers gen alpha different approach. not. smell great except sweet orange, even one bad.   Stop giving attention anti vaxers arguing online. want it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're point, US, everyone wants vaccine likely already least partially vaccinated. We're starting get back normal. They're hurting time stop giving want.  businesses really going back office? liked flexibility don‚Äôt want end back 2019 robots less faith others. People (myself included) funny. shot administered, actually feel (I believe man giving numbed area ahead time). 

My first thought realized was: ""Oh no! feel it, must administered right/ correct area.""

Which course, silly, looking back it. Viruses care lines humans draw maps: 11. thought might week, looks like might another week 20k cases day. since existence AZ good poorer countries, anything wish go law, pat back?

Mind you, I'm lawyer. knowledge know fine fair not. fine laws, interpreted judges, say. cripples AZ maybe thought respecting contracts. think create precedent company necessary, law. Gee, seem hyperbolic all.

You're making world one really advocating for, - making different choices mean absolutely nothing mitigate spread, means things shutting schools expecting everyone stay house time. almost impossible denigrate Pfizer-Biontech vaccine considering vaccine saving people's ass mess. Johnson &amp; Johnson doses administer first place. delivered every week since April rate 35,000 45,000 per delivery. lasts us 3 hours ordinary vaccination day. Great adults Direct communication rarely works precisely *because* scientists use words differently general public.

‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù great example. ‚ÄúGenerally true‚Äù colloquially means ‚Äúmostly true‚Äù. technically means ‚Äúalways true, without exception‚Äù. Teachers take away exercise punishment really understand kids work. They're going disruptive get time run around play. probably tons pent energy socialization they're acting way first place. 

A good teacher would pivot exercise lets socialize learning, even stand dance stretch 10 minutes get systems. know always possible, limits teachers, kids need kids. People put shoes couch/bed filthy. even like shoes HOUSE. GTFO shit. horrified first time witnessed behavior. Hopefully motivate companies grossly overpromise deliveries future pandemics.  probably lockdowns strict rules vaccines kept deaths relatively low considering given older folks first. compare wave winter wave clear much fewer deaths. lot people intuitively assume severity side effect directly correlated degree efficacy vaccine.

However data support assumption. people severe reactions vaccine, all. People groups receive benefits vaccine. Yes. I'm science following person comorbidities yet I've around tons people including indoors party like 12 people within past weeks I'm fully vaccinated.

If fully vaccinated, pandemic you, period. Ehhh.. much, nice would be.

$150 J&amp;J

$200 doses Mod/Pfiz, $50 first dose $150 upon 2nd one. comes eats cost blinks first. thing happened last April Australia start Formula 1 season. People literally lined outside gates waiting get cancelled. side cancels cover biggest costs TV contracts, etc. sit wondering made 5 years online standard education... Oh Yeah! parents assholes least get norovirus! shit everywhere. respectfully disagree. 17yo wasn‚Äôt allowed social media younger. she‚Äôs older desire social media. observe peers, seems upbeat positive kids. 19. feel solid relationship. talks everything asks many questions. friends kids say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird actually talks rather phone room‚Äù. kept social media? I‚Äôm sure. believe social media plays much bigger role kids behavior outlook. course tanks empty. You‚Äôre scaring constant coverage death. scrapped lesson plans year I‚Äôm focusing social/emotional activities like trivia games silly dances.

My kid, 2nd grade, lucky school system basically said would doing. added supplementary summer program help get back academically. one month ""in school"" two hours day, one month summer. really like approach. Stop prescriptivist. saying that.....covid likely circulating u.s prior January, makes sense since main vector spread time travelers china before, during, Chinese new year. support prior point?

The real incompetence still comes china. tried save face suppress news virus spreading china. world would better handle covid news dropped December instead late January . what? people's obsession people's grime? impact all. I've never gotten sick touching things grocery store neither you. That's thing. adults going (by large) *tool kit* appropriately cope stress last year. 

How could expect children to?

Resiliency mean anything without end game support. see Chinese bot.  100% repercussions lockdowns. However, mental repercussions would way worse happened kids watched even people dying became afraid even go get food store might die, too. Whatever response was, always going trauma.  fair strict lockdowns also worked vaccines available. provinces still lockdown still strict rules. live hypochondriac world now. Sinovac effective younger people whose immune responses stronger. proportional decrease every state too? Yes. 

We're talking 50%+ total population. were, 25 states that, would 5. Honestly, even literally true, what? I've apparently ingesting rat piss entire life absolutely side effects truthful guess bad? It‚Äôs probably fine you‚Äôre vaccinated. realized last summer like local drive theater better regular ones I‚Äôm probably going back indoor theater sometime next winter gets bit cold drive in. honestly asinine. No, all. kind headlines scared bit past months since young, vaccinated (with J&amp;J vaccine) nothing major happened (and hundreds young people stood line weekend) sure feel now.  

However, suck deaths happen. think look common trait people severe reactions. investigation that? Hmm. Yes, bad move conservatives. another party could elected since time, holding office power re-implement ability domestically produce vaccines.  investigation team already visited Wuhan, China. call lead taken. Time stop.... now? 

""People"" stopped wiping groceries last April, ever all.

The out-of-touchness articles serious damage level respect average citizens disease prevention. already improved. Mind still slow comparison pretty much everybody else, least 3-4 times fast beginning month. Idk, guess. ask people wrote article Yup! Gyms one biggest harbors MRSA outside hospitals. Lol wut? Can't go outside? I've Toronto ""longest"" lockdown we've always able go outside wherever whenever want park, jogs, meeting people outside, grab takeout etc, goto stores .. indoor activities like bars, clubs, gyms etc that's closed took 6 months find intermediate host sars-1. 

Politicians aren‚Äôt asking conclusion. They‚Äôre asking investigation. That‚Äôs need, isn‚Äôt direct evidence either theory need take theories seriously get bottom it. 

The HIV thing isn‚Äôt relevant. SARS MERS analogous cases, found intermediate hosts outbreaks much quicker one. even mention SARS-COV2 doesn‚Äôt even appear infect bats efficiently... also tested vaccine 3700 teenagers (or 4000 listen evening news, know accurate) small sample size make claim like 100% effective. Good point. really uneasy EU going this. AZ messed everyone seems forgetting noble unique intention contrasts huge profits Moderna etc make. Literally main plot point Inside Riley keeping together, can't forever needs mom dad recognize struggles allow space sad.

I think lot kids. resilient still need us. ;) Serologic Testing US  
Blood Donations Identify Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)‚ÄìReactive Antibodies: December 2019‚ÄìJanuary  seroprevalence 
 epicenter Wuhan, Hubei, six selected provinces containment 
 first epidemic wave COVID-19 Let kids live normal lives summer, psychotic freaks CDC assuming unvaccinated continue wear masks.

Got source claim? omg yes. Online relationships huge fucking pain. 

My DnD group thing survived. Thanks. sounds much better days (we get speak 5 minutes 3 times week family zoom therapy 45 minutes week). never lived zoom calls like 

It‚Äôs special kind heartbreak can‚Äôt fix things child. 

I‚Äôll take sounding good last saw person day. That‚Äôs definitely kids resilient expect end like measles circulates poor countries pops back developed countries vaccine coverage lacking.

This likely going happen. scary part though years mutations, vaccines probably become obsolete. Already South African Indian variants better able break through.

Until develop effective Pan coronavirus vaccine, doubt going away good.  suppose 9/11 Coronavirus. 14. Everything changed. somehow, seems worse. guess everything kinda good 9/11. towers fell, watched country slip stone cold patriotism. Flash forward two decades, country fucking fire, even pandemic. pandemic straw poor kids. CDC influenced teachers union. India seriously poster child justifying US's vaccine response right now. Get line first; easier help shrink problems home want laugh comically evil is, can't, frankly terrifying real life Russia operates (without consequences apparently).  taught wipe tops cans prior opening them. Never know sort dust amd debris land cans storage shipping. still that. wash hands. Please people, keep washing hands. Uhh... brought point kids issues long term COVID whether symptoms not.

I posted study saying nearly children recover within 6 months. Science always evolving science outdated. everything copy/pasted. 100% dropping restrictions. CT last week, although data still weeks ramifications. Still digging wearing mask (in establishments allow it, still rule that‚Äôs ok).  EU stopped exports Australia, also threats ban exports UK stopped supplies lots raw also put pressure private businesses stop spreading lies.

Edit: proper links Canada Mexico received shipments million. US currently sending South Korea military. India saw increased export raw materials 20 million additional doses end April. mean‚Ä¶ least work required actually produced something? CFDB Edmonton it‚Äôs ensure don‚Äôt return others terrified ever going there. Australia NZ fucked even ordering Pfizer, mind blowing 2 countries among richest world fail hard vaccine procurement mind blowing even mad it.

You clearly know talking about. NZ made deal Pfizer October 2020. time signed deals AZ, Novavax J&amp;J ensure wide range types vaccines available NZ could get effective. purchased enough vaccines vaccinate population 4 times over. late delivery manufacturers prioritising countries invested development paid higher price per unit made huge orders. Yea. Well Reserves part time not, guys sacrifice quite bit time respect that. Spot divide bs. old. know many Reservists cops, firefighters, paramedics, top sacrifice weekend family, nights training. get it, full time. reservists, different aspect. choose wear flag shoulder, brother sister me. 

All asking, give credit due.

Don't worry, still get ton guys needed boot doot immediately, I'm sure guys get stuff. Almost definitely true. Something like 90% Senate Republicans say vaccinated, 45% House Republicans say so.

Either huge gap behavior, half House choosing answer even though vaccinated think politically beneficial / gives cover largest assholes. don‚Äôt think anyone really knows. don‚Äôt think CAF levied anything mutiny related since‚Ä¶ WW2? What's point? 99.9% people wear masks travel 0.1% risk people can't? Like, point trying make?   matter? Cases matter slightest deaths Hospitalizations down, across America papers coming first half 2020 didn‚Äôt provide concrete evidence airborne route, evidence leaning toward support not. CDC dragged heels this.

I don‚Äôt get argument wait evidence conclusive. presupposes assumed airborne route. early days pandemic, make assumption? CDC, think motivated wanting preserve masks cause panic. article mention lifetime immunity? must missed that. flip side: India may actually increased death rate due areas medical services overrun. Even younger patients may need oxygen treatments survive easily that, without oxygen, rate survival go quickly. figure 14 days date, since official statistics updated health system's computers working. told broke 2.5 million doses end today would correspond 50 doses per 100. despite opening people aged 45-49 week.

The amount fully vaccinated really indicate anything. reason US fewer people turning first shots.

Uptake practically 100% older age groups survey survey shows Ireland least particularly low hesitancy. even pushed getting it, since key us opening up.

The doubt achieving 82% adults June whether supply keep up. part unclear on?

Do want studies say masks help reduce Covid spread talking children catching Covid? studies long term effects catching Covid-19 can't find anything side you. would need wait 10 years. Lol, can't even use public washrooms people shit/piss floor never flush. Toronto, sure states different. Bunch animals here, litter floor time too. wipe boxes cereal??? Probably difficult know, maybe two infections two different variants?  Worse. Edmonton.

On serious note though, extremely empty place. 25 cell jail, half time literally 0 prisoners. I've heard, like basic training again, strictness harshness turned 11 - days consist lots drilling, marching, PT, etc. like civilian prison - make sure bed perfect, early wake ups, uniform inspections, cleaning place etc.

 lot tougher normal prison, bright side, victim prisoner violence others. Sentences also fairly short, 14-30 days. send think still salvagable. clicked check poorly written positive weren‚Äôt giving away everyone vaccinated. Yes understand difference IFR CFR, however case believe using commonly understood CFR inapplicable. 95% vaccinated population taken board infection, thus cases.

It highly likely pre existing condition causes immune system failed achieve adequate immune system response, preexisting condition leads eventual demise.

Ultimately believe argument simply semantics: could equally argue computed CFR needs divided 20, ratio successful unsuccessful vaccination.

That would also distort meeting commonly understood phrase CFR.  Alabama likely dependent country came back from. Seriously. hygiene issue without covid. Also, ""increased"" cleanings many gyms also standard, hard side eye places things like advertising cleaning week pandemic. didn‚Äôt see study touched variants (if bout covid protects current variants). vaccines work current variants. Something consider. hesitancy borderline non-existent Ireland. EU countries opened vaccines everyone, Ireland still 40 year olds virtually everyone offered one taking it.

Ireland also higher 39 doses per 100 people, due hack reported 10 days Haha yeah first state this? nice. Kids 12 cannot. spread germs like crazy.  Look studies covid immune response one vaccine. nothing. Gotta better vaccinations reach 70%.

Numbers look good though. Go it, one cares Yeah, took pretty seriously always something seemed like theater me. Indeed. Anyone got idea moderna experiencing delay shipping doses outside US? little news incoming shipment ordered moderna vaccines philippines. need compare CFR vaccinated age health risk. Assuming breakthrough cases ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù individuals unvaccinated CFR could high 10%.

I assuming breakthrough information people vaccinated first. I.E. nursing home residents major health issues. said above, Australia made error putting much faith AZ vaccine ended needing new deal late Pfizer. Sorry, that's incorrect. Said nothing work home. said get tested returning. gets tested regularly, travel otherwise. 

Your 2nd like vacation home ""incident"". article dated May 26,2020 talks husband ""last week"". Seems week May 26, 2020 month April 24, 2020 executive order permitting travel vacation homes. again, that's still evidence begging pleading people travel vacation so. ~~Try again~~ actually, nevermind...don't bother. I've wasted enough time. Working essential worker since start this, I‚Äôve lost hope people generally clean ngl. I‚Äôll continue wiping cleaning, peace mind anything else. Enough times day see someone pick eyes/nose/mouth, touch object (usually money!), go right back picking. day saw guy sneeze hand, grab bunch water bottles store, decide put back. People nasty it‚Äôs fact lmao. got mine last week, 2nd one early september favorite ""North American hygiene much better China hit us."" yeah right US ""advantage"", 10% population infected per CDC, unaccounted estimates even higher. going cautiously optimistic relaxed indoor masking rules, whose impact know weeks delay (pre-symptomatic &amp; asymptomatic spread). cause upward trend, we're good go. buy this. argument vaccinated simple, ""fuck em, vaccinated. affect let learn hard way."" would bet good money years private school kids school since last summer statistically measurable advantage public school kids home. damaged future fear. So, literally ignoring CDC recommendations. Unvaccinated supposed remain masked, includes good chunk school aged children eligible He's even qualified fire Chicken Cannon crappy analysis. needs compared number infections vaccinated group vs unvaccinated group. # deaths vaccinated group vs unvaccinated group. lot less viral spread spring 2021 winter 2020 people vaccinated.   Nah, considering got fined NHL breaking covid protocols first time went covid list, mysteriously got suspended time right went last time, think fair put Howe's name kind stupidity. Kuntz special Paywalled...please post also think maybe schools unmask August September Covid starts resurgence, remask. think mask people, especially kids, unless solid proof going make big difference. big believer masks necessity mandates thus far, can't afraid unmask kids summer Fall help much. panic.  

The studies particularly conclusive either way; recommendation appears abundance caution.

EU best union. Try prove wrong.  Vector vaccines technoogy supernew though, existing vector vaccine (quite new) ebola shot. Same. Curses try 3 months earlier kid born May. think point report William's death without making seem related vaccine. Yeah. Eventually, much less circulating R rate low enough shrug turn personal responsibility back individuals protect themselves. Let's face it, kids masking lot states even schools. watch real time what's happening states like Utah, Texas, Florida decide Fall states. data backlog, also restriction dropping. caused wild fluctuations. shown manageable, large vaccinated population dropping restrictions fine.

i hope vaccinate kids soon. suck masked person room can't get kid shot yet. Yes, sorry unclear. around 12/2020 Blockchain provide definite proof comparison, Germany (and therefore less also rest EU) ~55 doses per 100 people.

At moment bottleneck clearly delivery, 90% delivered doses used. thousands times likely acquire long-lasting health issues catching covid experience real side effects vaccine, likely catch covid eventually remain unvaccinated. Plus, vaccine provides much robust immune response (especially variants) natural immunity. 100% without doubt. Far downplaying dismissing need continued measures though already Covid? probably going get downvoted this, sure black white already Covid based available data.

I it, much wanted vaccine. thirties, covid riskier vaccine far. Plus, much want go back normal, small part herd immunity.

If already Covid, would opt least one vaccine get big immunity boost better protection variants. might opt J&amp;J get one vaccine considered fully vaccinated travel. me, would win-win.

in addition, need remind science ideology (althought people like Dawkins like push one, almost utilitarian sense), method, method continuously self-correcting. method self-corrects continuously described certain uncertain. 

So slight error there. 

if claiming that, incorrectly labeling it. 

To me, seems like answered previous question, , ""What language science referrring to?"" I‚Äôm curious much difference make States. I‚Äôm middle/high school teacher CA, think every student who‚Äôs wanted vaccine got within week made available 12+ here. policy aren't. policy.

Uncertain happen immune-evasive variants. far seem winning battle, takes one major mutation take hold spread. Yes, clearly there's line washing groceries wiping. recovering mild cases COVID-19, people still immune cells body pumping antibodies virus causes COVID-19, according study researchers Washington University School Medicine St. Louis. cells could persist lifetime, churning antibodies while.

Are antibody levels high enough detected antibody test? Realistically easy say. portion vaccinated population exposed virus quick way get number.

What could see compare amount death people (or cases) versus unvaccinated population timeframe study. 

We know 160 patients died 101 million vaccinated people. also know timeframe around 240000 people died COVID remaining population (we kind ignore small overlap). try see (very roughly) many non vaccinated people died group 101 million people divide number death people roughly 2.2 get 110000 deaths.

Vaccine effiacy preventing death (with lot simplifications roughly) = 100 - (160 / 110000 * 100) = 99.85% doesnt even really cost anything since ohio every state funding incentive programs federal stimulus money. per rules money, states use stimulus money handful things, incentive programs one That's easy enough explain - probably asymptomatic first time never reached stage developing immune memory. teens forever; might well give immune systems head start fighting FREAKING DEADLY VIRUS.

Come on, put thought it. allowing even fully vaccinated people dine together large group did.

Obviously are, since it. LOL Correct I'm wrong, evidence strong memory cells COVID infection, reasonable assume even someone reinfected, would brief mild antibodies would quickly deployed.

Protective immunity sterilizing immunity, still lot better nothing. One thing blows mind people put trust random Facebook posts friends, family, FDA, on.

The house current political power structure. Right now, I'd say house failing. Things falling apart, due foundation - solid needs repaired (if replaced). Nothing get better foundation gotten better. (FYI personally assign blame sides - R D, blame R recently ofc.)

In metaphor, walls stuff like economy, help people get crisis, etc. foundation particular people government helm power.

Yeah, numbers low Canada time... think still shows main point well enough... people get Covid, get close contact, asymptomatic rare, people still symptoms... test people close contact, test people symptoms, catch cases.

Recently rapid testing schools here, came similar results... using random sampling basically waste, produced low numbers... Covid rampant schools recently. count started US

Keep Yes science clear, vaccinated people safer around unvaccinated people. 

The CDC deems risk vaccinated people low enough worry either mean zero. Well, rabbit hole. Everyone cites Tulane study, cites 2007 PowerPoint Southwest Research Institute give sources

http://www.boulder.swri.edu/clark/binhaz07.ppt Lol. I‚Äôll fix it.  But, reality, places staying remote don‚Äôt deal it. it‚Äôs anti-vaxers fault. Especially youths.

The brain stop developing 24-26 years old.

You put chemicals (even ones brain produces) brain finished developing, affect said development.

It possible 20 year old abnormal brain development due smoking cannabis.

And last portion brain finish developing region responsible controlling assessing risk. younger people things older people clearly see stupidly risky. that's portion brain's development hindering, possible could affect risk assessment entire life. Ok totally valid decision there‚Äôs shortage doses RN Thank reminding continue give fuck people told wasting money buying 10 month old seat strapping car seat trip. risk, vaxxed person, *slightly* elevated around unvaxxed (the vaccines *very* good 100%).

But choice segregate unvaxxed probably based profit science. let get straight. people care enough lives get vaccinated, every 2-5 year old NY help shoulder burden keeping alive? Come man. even think type? Sadly they‚Äôre focused legislation like NCLB ‚Äúperformance‚Äù goals. Teaching test weeds kids bad memorizing.

It‚Äôs like manager given responsibility single metric. entire project doomed turns adding dancing hamster feature results 0.000025 bump metric. I'm sorry, typing quickly, got first statement backwards. 

My point comment mere existence excess deaths imply excess deaths due COVID, also massive change way people live lives.

A lot people (presumably included) see ""excess deaths"" exceeding coded COVID deaths, think they're undercounted. think opposite, given way cases counted coded. fact pretty substantial levels non-COVID excess mortality (and rarely discussed) tells we're underestimating share excess mortality. Nope, provinces restrictions last November? second wave winding provinces loosened restrictions back restrictions. mainly vaccines Nova Scotia see biggest surge require lockdown bring numbers down. Also, weather may affect cases little plenty examples warm weather areas massive surge cases. However, moving forward people vaccinated see fewer cases rules loosened. Lmao people paralyzed lockdowns, shutdowns restrictions

They paralyzed pandemic. former teenager, feeling magnified teenager, including anxiety depression. depth experience know feelings pass. It‚Äôs free ride it‚Äôs listening science data. That‚Äôs son‚Äôs entire life.   parents worked 100 years two them. Dad forced retire mom got cancer served caretaker. wealth gone. insurance, cost months hospital, surgeries, medicine treatments destroyed lives.

America, right? CDC report notes certainly underestimate breakthrough infections reporting voluntary many asymptomatic cases may never tested. Also, clear study breakthrough infections likely new, concerning variants.

Oh.  article talking vaccine mandates bar individuals eligible vaccine going school/work, shutting whole place people refuse get vaccinated? example says lawsuits ""whether schools may require shots students, faculty staff members way many require familiar vaccines measles chickenpox"". staff member student measles vaccine shut whole school, say person can't school unless get vaccinated.   three kids aged 13-8 tell true. Pandemic online school messed mental health BIG time. lower risk around people vaccinated. 

The risk low regardless anti-vaxxers get free ride people taking vaccine. haven‚Äôt seen anywhere actually pediatric data 2020 yet. ages, include kids along everyone else, it‚Äôs actual data. I‚Äôve seen lots articles anecdotes none actual data showing rise youth suicides. Restrictions haven‚Äôt really changed Alberta since basically January

Pardon me, absolutely false, quite frankly misinformation suggest restrictions much.

[New restrictions introduced early included:

- K-12 post-secondary schooling moved online instead in-person
- patio dining closed
- Retail reduced 10% capacity
- Personal services like hair salons, tattoo studios, tanning salons nail salons completely closed
- Places worship capped 15 people
- Funerals capped 10 people
- Outdoor gatherings reduced 5 people 10

Heck, Pfizer/BioNTech even consistently over-delivered upped targets.  Yes (16f) completely agree you. dad asked day- ‚Äúmy generation wanted make money kids would great life, don‚Äôt think generation goals. Why?‚Äù

I tried explain want pass earth. need make world better everyone, future kids may may able afford. We‚Äôre running time. core issue 300M doses EU hoped receive. It‚Äôs 90M doses AZ committed deliver Q2, already cutting delivery expectations half.

Obviously. case UK ok. top 10 per capita Europe world, third Italy Poland terms large European countries. Maybe different experiences? dunno.

In seriousness, fantastic. wish people would focusing rather trying undermine vaccine efficacy. truth mRNA vaccines simply amazing.  seriously doubt masks source problems. Kids able go school interact friends almost certainly FAR damaging masks. mean suppose seeing faces causes mental health issues interesting theory I'm sure there's evidence seeing part face problematic, especially compared bigger issues caused like isolation, fear, sharing economic stress parents impacted. Masks probably least worries.  Still wait 2 weeks fully vaccinated I'm still wearing mask...also one family members immunocompromised. say, I'm exhausted people racist idiots Asian Americans COVID feel like people rude I'm wearing mask (just experienced today). Effing ridiculous wearing mask literally hurt anyone. hate feel even conspicuous given attention I'm Asian. remember beginning pandemic worried wear one Asians getting beaten wearing one feel like people feel even justified nasty since mandates lifted. really annoying. I'll still error side people's health safety. least either national cases get meaningfully low better idea common long term side effects are. got look other. individual risk low, actually clear ongoing safety surveillance received reports **six cases** CVST thrombocytopenia occurring **7 14 days vaccination**... cases reported **among 7.2 million persons vaccinated**

...people develop symptoms vaccination contact doctor seek urgent medical care. clock...with vaccines plus natural immunity it‚Äôs running hosts   that‚Äôs Republican / conservative concept That, also decades lobbied regulatory bodies failing protect American people creating general atmosphere distrust. even know say whole ""It's even vaccine!"" thing. knew would vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, whole lot soon started working one; expectations level sheer *stupidity* sadly far mark.

Absolutely true. ""hybrid"" two known coronaviruses, well-characterized mechanisms viruses recombine nature. Well, put blame previous partners, (I blame all,) changed found *right* partner. Yes, therapy helped recognize understand fears anxieties formed, helped manage them, enough without finding partner compatible with. Someone whose temperament trigger latent fears. Someone steady reliable consistent.

As result divorce, lacking children feeling secure base. We're probably seeking fill void adult relationships. partners provide that. Relationship dynamics wildly different two given people. like person lot, even love them, still terrible match.

One example mean argue well. Many people argue way that, us, shakes foundation relationship. ruin trust arguments stoke worst fears. children divorce, constructive arguments probably modeled us parents. witness two people argue intensely still end day.

So hindsight, would've let go bad relationships sooner instead grasping straws force work. trying desperately establish secure base people never going me. fear losing partner outweighed desire find right partner.

But one things think told you, us learn experience. ""Some""? anti-vaxxers still    admire gusto, silly, doubt Detroit would agree that. tried critical thinking already two weeks since CDC altered outdoor mask guidance even already incredibly cautious. We've known months outdoor spread major factor thus outdoor mask mandates necessary. 

This cautious, overkill sending false messages activities done safely. people wear masks outside, they're likely go outside. That's going far safer inside mask.

You want people picnics beach/park, rather meeting homes. 

We long past point outdoor mask mandates make sense.

I understand politicization virus damage did, think there's enough discussion extreme measures caused people give entirely incorrect assumption take ""all"" precautions worth taking any.

üêéüëû problem Trump said bunch bullshit alongside made people disregard entire message. Here's Reuters article April last year: says saw evidence came lab (which probably lie). insinuates China 'let spread' 'did somebody something purpose?'. also people believing could artificially created, directly countered evidence originally proposed.  Yeah, someone job vaccinated March got COVID. symptoms didn‚Äôt sound mild spoke phone last week. Another one (also vaccinated) coworkers got back trip India, wonder asymptomatic passed one Indian variants him. 

Eight Yankees players vaccinated got COVID weeks ago, seemed like symptoms mild. sounds like CDC counting breakthrough cases require hospitalization, seems like apples oranges comparison they‚Äôre quoting figures like one headline. 

‚ÄúThe CDC report notes certainly underestimate breakthrough infections reporting voluntary many asymptomatic cases may never tested. Also, clear study breakthrough infections likely new, concerning variants."" non-Canadian finds incongruous Premier using D-Day frame reference, 15,000 Canadians took place landings Juno Beach hundreds lost life assault. Get vaccinated! Enjoy benefits :) 100% agree everything said, especially work.

I always liked watching Dark Knight TV home, last week saw theater get used going back. It‚Äôs complete masterpiece theater compared home. never got hit bad COVID, ended similar shoes Michigan Oregon. Luckily, mild resurgence spring. Cases dropping significantly almost restrictions lifted, big picture looks promising. Yeah lets hope time catches people vaccinated. comparison painfully apt. mom spent 2 hours literally shrieking phone vaxspiracies. Apparently fault gently asked passing take look newer data really encouraging. understand happened. closed travel to/from China anyone else, took ton shit still already late.

That still allow something like 40,000 people travel China US. respect that. Personally, I'm fully Vaccinated ready get back life 2019. I'll going ball games, county fairs, hopefully cruise ship, amusement parks.

I hope see alot people kids caution things miniscule bad mental health everyone, especially children. death rate July 31 September 31 virtually never exceeded 1-2/day. Since death lag behind cases weeks, assume low level since least early-mid July. Denmark death rate 0-1/day, lower might expected since country half population. Looking European countries similar population similar level Sweden, higher (such Belgium). truly think texas natural vaccine immunity combined canada simply ignorant situations countries. Matter fact texas still many daily deaths canada. least reported deaths. total, Texas way deaths per capita canada it‚Äôs even close.

Of course. said natural immunity vaccinations Texas *at time lifted restrictions* (March 2nd) much higher Canada's immunity right now. 

As Canada vaccinated one dose: one dose 80% effective, two doses 95% effective, according best data. Granted, covers symptomatic infections asymptomatic ones, doubt large part Canada's case rate consists asymptomatic, vaccinated people. ‚ÄúSomeone left *their* umbrella,‚Äù grammatically correct sentence. original post also grammatically correct. argue pass out, fact you‚Äôre wrong one. gender subject sentence specified, singular correct object pronoun.

Well that‚Äôs point, dose 1 even need dose 2 carries similar risk? sufficient protection severe disease, I‚Äôll wait mix actually safer, effective vaccine second.

This would happened US would gone ""herd inmunity"" route.

Thankfully enough people resisted urges unmentionables death toll US limited ""mere"" 500,000+ Americans.

Without sabotage response, would less 10,000 casualties would last summer.


Are aware that, think deceived? things presented fact, accompanying evidence talking points, yes generally discarded political conspiracy. facts verifiable evidence put forth, yes circumstances investigated further. facts evidence available 12+ months ago, administration time failed properly investigate order reach factual conclusions supported real evidence. mom saying ""not even vaccine"" thing. think gets Mercola. dont know conspiracy sources spreading BS. nonsensical. claims done research done nothing read Mercola's ghostwritten fear mongering. think that's really all.

Personally, athlete, I'd little upset Tokyo/Japan pulled point get shit together. Vaccines available top myriad sports occurred worldwide done safe environments, really excuses.

Yeah likelihood boosters (in countries) cases dropping zero make really question worry about.

If we'd stricter protocols elsewhere, maybe could've safely kept schools open. Hell, even mean lock downs, contact tracing joke good tracing could've made huge impact.

NYC overall hit 50% total population least one dose, hopefully continue see slow steady increase lower-vaccinated areas city.   Word still mine. end mask mandate starts 5/28 Murphy announced new executive order today employers allow employees forego masks social distancing prove vaccination status. Hopefully give site push week two. company wide policy employees vaccinated ditch masks prove corporate medical team vaccinated site said would follow new policy needed reviewed nothing changing notice. Tuesday, Biden administration¬†announced¬†that half all¬†adults¬†in U.S. fully vaccinated, 70% of¬†adults¬†in Massachusetts across New England.

At first thought headline meant 50% adults vaccinated, nope. accurate! mean dropping mask mandate literal ban wearing masks? simple majority require larger percentage vote? Got Pfizer. First shot, side effects beyond sore arm. Second shot, felt little weather afternoon nothing. See that‚Äôs even misrepresentation. said ‚Äúwe know vaccinated people spread virus, continue wear mask vaccinated.‚Äù 

Which media changed ‚Äúvaccinated people may able still spread virus, need still wear mask.‚Äù 

Which people interpreted ‚Äúvaccinated people spread virus.‚Äù Yeah, southern European countries much stricter enforcement. allowed meet anyone first lockdown fairly well observed. pretty much never saw groups park. Good  great gesture stop banning unused vaccines almost two quarters in... it, 85-90%, 60% 66%??? That‚Äôs says  ""Lab leak"" generalization investigation may fill details exactly happened. addition punitive measures mentioned, also knowledge gained lab practices safety measures. protocols place, followed, labs need review protocols similar weaknesses, etc. mean, cousin ticketed Madrid taking unauthorized exercise walks last March.

If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus&amp;subject=Removed comment&amp;message=I'm writing following comment: longer conspiracy theory, stop calling that. real hypothesis deserves real scrutiny.  Except vaccinated individuals saying continue wear mask. Why?  Well, symptoms, got tested. I'd rather know.  True. think [Moderna asymptomatic testing trials people came second dose, little, showed level (clearly nowhere near high level protection study shows 2 doses).  Exactly !! understand changed suddenly ?  theory true also happening Sputnik...

I'm finding conflicting information whether Sputnik-V's spike protein native 2-P proline substituted, sources seem indicate native-type, like Astrazeneca.
So probably similar behavior AZ, speculation. Forgive getting vaccinated wear mask. trust CDC science. trust there, many people proven untrustworthy. Besides, given effect Flu season 2020, maybe ought keep precautions little longer? go 38 million cases needing doctor's appointment worse, 22,000 deaths, way 2300 CASES TOTAL needing doctor worse, good reason keep wiping masking social distancing...... still clinging idea ""no evidence"" lab leak? got test saying ""positive IgG"". 13 months later, I'm still inmune

That says. says detectable levels antibodies, necessarily sterilizing number (which somewhat dependent variants play). Vaccination significantly increase protection. really enjoyed video. also wonder also people (some them) covid weeks prior vaccine experiencing myocarditis, say occur weeks viral infection. might coincidence some.

And also thinking spacing two doses bit could maybe help. Quebec, getting 2nd dose 3 months 1st. 

Still, type thing hypochondriac ass wanted know haha. ""Corruption okay bad things happen anyway"" lmao listen getting actual virus would cause body create perfect immunity virus compared vaccine. Marine Recruits Reveals **Imperfect Immunity** Effects COVID-19 thought first released vaccines said like 5% chance got pfizer moderna? That's likely case. 

Natural immunity lower efficacy rate mNRA vaccines, evidence vaccines boost things like antibodies more.

**So go get vaccinated.** Yup‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs reason don‚Äôt go gym‚Ä¶ lazy blob. believe whatever government tells official finding like good citizen. same. Amirite?! different flu bunch ways. type virus is, way infects cells, fact vascular disease rather pulmonary disease, way mutate rapidly flu, on. Everything complete opposite libertarianism.

Read book something.

Redditors days. Maybe didn‚Äôt understand would affect humans? Maybe didn‚Äôt know lab leak first? lab might known leaked it.  context past year, lockdowns restrictions changed people's behavior ways we've never seen before, sometimes, ways understand yet. 

For example, despite mobility data people working home like never before, traffic-related fatalities *increased* 

Prelim data showed people dying form preventable causes, like heart disease diabetes, possibly public scared visit ER's 

And finally, dementia deaths well. possible, maybe even probable, deaths merely 'pulled forward' months years, 2020 see spike. routines dementia patients fragile begin with, lockdowns pandemic PPE measures would confuse scare patients 

And finally, studies starting show that, least children, Covid hospitalization numbers inflated tested positive admitted hospital reasons - *with* Covid, *from* Covid.  Congrats ur vaccine! Thank much. nice weather I‚Äôll trouble occupying myself! Good times ahead :) mean knew were, seems bit foolish assert 99% safe.

I less forgiving anyone still believes last year conclusively backed data available general public would like word Gloryholes encouraged start  /Investigation intensifies  20% young, healthy adults reinfected within 6 Marine Recruits Reveals Imperfect Immunity Effects go get vaccinated.** It‚Äôs also much easier handle logistics single dose. sure don‚Äôt remember exact numbers. let‚Äôs say placebo group 20% end getting infected versus test group 1% get infected. 10% placebo group infected versus .5% test group. conclude vaccine 95% effective preventing spread assuming good sample size subjects tested regularly detect asymptotic spread. People fucking stupid. Obviously it‚Äôs airborne. Everyone knew  mostly agree consider physical dangers covid mental health challenges what‚Äôs going on, don‚Äôt entirely agree framing two goals (physical mental health) opposed. Yes, people experienced mental health impacts restrictions. hadn‚Äôt taken restrictions, it‚Äôs like mental health would totally fine. Living pandemic always going stressful. people might mentally better without restrictions, might lot worse numbers got even worse due lack restrictions. It‚Äôs also stressful forced go normal knowing it‚Äôs safe. never way get without impacting mental health way. really think people understand impact youth. thinking early couple weeks month would manageable, full year young putting lives hold vulnerable people, serious consequences.

People grew great depression still affected day, main period 1929 1932. remember parents losing job, food home. entire life they're hesitant markets, like money bank, frugal everything have.

Even single year shape entire culture. Look Great Chinese Famine (1959‚Äì1961), something like 40 million people died starvation. People watch family members starve wide spread acts cannibalism. food. people lived food guarantee, take can. Chinese people go abroad they're often seen rude bad manners. Many older Chinese people experienced true scarcity, changes people. teach kids lessons learned famine continues on.

As COVID-19, Gen Z already socially inept. really cruel them, amount social anxiety come this... covid schools still regular flu seasons, kids told ""Wash hands stay home fever"" imagine differently sounds 12 year old today. parents extra freaked COVID two years they're told flu season they're friend gets normal flu, ""Will whole school shut again?""

Then actual impact education itself. like missing 1 year 4 year college degree means still got 75% education. need actually understand content course previous year understand higher level courses. one year subpar given pass/fail grade distance labs open book exams google every answer, proper college education. people need fill actual roles society, they're given free pass college ""because COVID"" doctors, technicians, engineers know they're they're education got screwed up. mention lost internships networking opportunities job fairs got cancelled companies stopped hiring. Maybe China saw making people sick reacted lockdowns? Maybe didn‚Äôt literal buffoons open racists running american government, could‚Äôve spent less time crying gina time responding appropriately knowing exactly virus worked like every civilized Asia pacific country successfully did. you‚Äôre shitty racist 100% time, maybe call country people listen especially using slurs using evidence. Lots ways get people listen you. It‚Äôs called asshat every day. r/iamverysmart People keep repeating ""kids resilient"".

unfortunately, lot people saying actually mean ""kids **better be** resilient, adults enough shit deal with, kids gotta figure shit without help supervision"" wait they've vaccinated population. 


You know sensible way deal pandemic lol. 


The criticism countries seem acquired vaccines slower rate western countries, logic sound, vaccinate population reopen.  one cares opinion. Yeah, feel that. Lost college friends basically finished last year half college without there. Totally destroyed social aspects it. almost delusional hoax-believers.  agree you, try understand schools stuck. teach 5th grade feels like third parents understanding, third get mad child asked work weird year, third get mad standards bit relaxed normal. Meanwhile students‚Äô needs gone up, local funding risk due less money coming covid federal funding could impacted test scores fall. sucks around everyone, schools parents struggling navigate it. mom still this. groceries packages ""quarantined"" garage five days. packaging food gets delivered order restaurant wiped first eat. also shower within 30 minutes arriving home, phones, eyeglasses, wallets, etc. disinfected first.

It's ridiculous, really.  simple questions China, WHO, able answer.

Who believe Patient Zero China and/or Wuhan?

How China believe virus originated mutated?

What China believe done prevent outbreaks like future? Since March 2020, really? Oh man, sucks hard. kids literally crying closed school two weeks open month half year lockdown.

We excellent homeschooling provided them, kids friends, us parents closest relatives. really missed social aspect achool.  Still technically member reserves... never wiped groceries, once. idea freaked out. Trust say took **every** precaution avoid COVID solid year ... that. 

When heard thing, like ""... shit. welp, I'm stuff, get COVID anyway mfn groceries, doomed start"". Luckily, luck good enough &amp; never caught Rona, fully vaxxed 3 months Thanks. thought maybe Jennifer. Nah everyone hates schmo funding purpose built quarantine 

And slow vaccine rollout can‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt exist. even gonna report one, enjoy billion downvotes alternative facing reality trauma though, nobody really ready see flawed parents upbringing shapes parent. chance running type serious investigation country powerful opaque China going cooperate investigation.

The UN G7 take lead threaten sanctions China doesn‚Äôt cooperate. virus came lab, leaked accidentally, China covered up, China would liable trillions reparations rest world.

No one stomach though. wait till USA reaches herd immunity. really waiting. Vaccines still high demand.


Aus making one million az week.

Then getting pizler like 200k week. increase.

They def could ordered different mix. But. excuse explanation: Uber provide insulated bags driver carry food in, kinda catch-as-catch-can. 

by contrast, GrubHub provides noice hot-bag big enough hold pizzas in, long they're 14-inch smaller. DoorDash also provides hot-bag smaller, like burgers tacos. (source: drive three, others) person replying correct. Suicides down. We've borders closed 14 months always plan re-open vaccinations complete. would shockingly stupid suddenly abandon plan. article seems ignore closing borders never meant permanent. 

The govt open fact Covid endemic going forward community cases NZ open borders. waiting somewhere around 80% population vaccinated ensure R0 stays 1 local outbreaks quickly die off. 

In Budget last week Treasury predicted significant border opening January 2022. success vaccine roll-out determine they're right. bulk vaccinations begin August. Yes OCD  That's crazy.

But one personally find completely absurd people still want restrictions continue protect ever-safer group morons (anti-vax) super-low-risk (children) individuals.

I necessarily think everyone taken COVID vaccine anti-vax traditional sense term.

Personally, I've issue past vaccine spend several days hospital due reaction. So, like fear vaccine microchips 5G lumped folks unfair. topic mental health, affect negatively.  states shut schools, yell parent nothing with? real winner understand that. two variables changing can‚Äôt attribute positivity rate one selected variables fit narrative. dunno someone choose go college? didn‚Äôt say chose finish remotely.

""For unvaccinated adults indoors close conversation outdoors, costs mask vastly lower risks Covid. trade-offs different outdoor settings, different children. Covid risks children similar normal flu (as charts show).

There appear much scientific reason campers counselors, people, wear mask outdoors summer. Telling example extreme caution ‚Äî like staying ocean avoid sharks ‚Äî seems greater cost benefit.""

Kids wear masks outside summer. 10 minutes math homework, 10 minutes reading/writing read/be read 20 minutes night. also simple homework could sat cooked got things around night. required adult help supervision. school teach we‚Äôve virtual year. came back hybrid model kids class okay.

As per social media, think media general (includes games, youtube, movies, cartoons, streamers, etc) becoming toxic well.

But please (and thank you), could describe exactly changes seeing? Social media reason we‚Äôre depressed.

The internet may play role, raised let us see people First world countries things. governments seem care live die, basic healthcare access doesn‚Äôt bankrupt people.

Even hearing potential bird flu would lose sleep (keeping myself), imagine emergency really happened. let go fuck back school see friends.... anyone evaluated cost program versus additional number people estimated vaccinated result?

Children primary schools wear masks rarely ever see outside. reason, Australia's budget based assumption significant border opening mid 2022 even though enough vaccines Australians end 2021. wonder is!

Social media use symptom many ways larger issues. Cummings full it. Government UK unprepared pandemic government NZ done fantastic, example western world. Keep way listen naysayers.

Original Covid R number 2.5
1 - (1 / 2.4) = 
1 - 0.4 = 0.6 (or 60% herd immunity).

Kent variant roughly 40% transmittable, R3.5, 71%. Indian variant another (this guess UK scientists) 50% R5.25 = 80% herd immunity.

However r number constant. people packed, unmasked, crowded room would much higher r number numbers sitting park.

Testing identify people quarantine would also reduce infection rates. Mask wearing public transport would also help, etc. took pain medicine 30mins 1st Moderna vaccine (500mg Acetaminophen) heard people really bad arm pain wanted avoid that.

CDC apprised general thinking rheumatoid arthritis infusions lowered effectiveness vaccine.

So give ""empathy refuse vaccine"" bullshit peddling. asshole gave us COVID stayed home, masked, gelled FUCKING VACCINATED Dad would alive facing ever much hospital bills. Dumbass.

As brother, DD vaccinated brother idiot DD received notifications eligibility get vaccine day popped positive.  oregon announced similar lottery, tho oregons probably gonna better since county also lottery top states lottery, means least populated counties highest chances among vaccinated That's part secret service security unfortunately. always multiple routes often give reasons warning changes plans.

I feel like argument many make deny Covid, ignoring fact tiny number people ""dying Covid"" would noise. Something like 1% people diagnosed Covid died within couple weeks.... determine number people ""died Covid""... figure odds one person dying 2 week period is... take extremely tiny number subtract 1%. also somewhat problematic counting beds COVID-positive patients means count whole bunch nosocomial cases count people hospital something completely different, happening test positive.

Two birds one stone. antibodies 6 months felt little sick day December. Imagine COVID then. give blood month see still antibodies. Haven‚Äôt vaccine never taken COVID test. doctor would know cell response likely generate life long immunity... Ontario locked capacity since October, yet 3rd wave  think news organizations disservice advertising he's vaccinated. gotcha them, always fail mention natural immunity. Mine allowing request, move requiring 1 - 2 days week later year (probably long term.) Masks still required regardless vaccination status. person department chosen come back, probably one hybrid starts. Hopefully point decade able create single seasonal flu/seasonal covid vaccine accounts major variants emerge year us believe science like breathing get folks roll dice. feel kids growing right now. School adolescence hard enough can‚Äôt imagine dealing top everything going pandemic world right now. Even adult struggle process make sense cruelty selfishness see world. EU nearest peer, it‚Äôs closest comparison. article names particular lawfirm, Siri &amp; Glimstad Manhattan, behind lot bullying places (like schools employers) drop vaccine mandates. 

I thought people know case, say, landlord might persuaded double rent something. seem work them. haven‚Äôt read many complaints. Yes didn‚Äôt enough people approved give vaccinations. friend got first dose sinovac Chile received Pfizer US different/abnormal side effects. talk doctor though, wait bit getting Pfizer. Yeah physically mentally abused child. didn‚Äôt even... consciously... realize year.

It something aware of, like telling friend last year, I‚Äôd told like ‚Äúwait... abused. Hold on! abused!! fuck?!? realize abused!!!?!‚Äù

So yeah... kids resilient, experiences influence they‚Äôre older. know Alberta asymptomatic testing 2020, numbers ridiculously low stopped it... think something like .01% positivity rate symptoms close contact. 

Plus know antibody testing random samples population see many people gotten Covid, never diagnosed, son one trials. sucks hearing makes feel bad even though know shouldn't. Rural white people urban minorities likely hospitalized covid, they‚Äôre ones responding lottery. Mine yelled crying it. idk. Mostly ended distancing haven‚Äôt really spoken teen could help meant criticism.

There lot that... emotional abuse, neglect... drinking drugs (one parents) probably narcissistic sociopathic tendencies...

I learned show emotions people issues trust relationships. Oh well. got yelled going ‚ÄúWhy treating us like that?‚Äù would abuse us mom brother would ask starting fights... alone isolated small town.

Sure, except half Asia, Australia, etc damage certainly high, don‚Äôt see AZ could liable damages related pandemic. agreed deliver vaccines, end pandemic assume risks related it. mental health social skills went shit quarantine god can‚Äôt imagine bad kids.

What nightmare. deserve cut out. Everyone else might ask questions uncomfortable better living deal that. shit terrifies me. I'm 25. one age really phone like age 9 10 earliest, back smartphones really thing. kids get phone 10-13, usually flip phone, one really smartphones high school.

But knowing true infection rate -- times probably significantly higher 1 100 -- would helpful, I'd think. know? One dose fully vaccinated? Fully vaccinated 4 believe. 

It also noted MS, AL GA lowest percentage vaccine doses used. means percentage doses state received vs doses administered. Book learning second right opinion. Young kids need development humans right anything EU? know talking about. information would rejoin EU tomorrow brexit huge mistake. conflating several issues, sounds like personal experience AZ colouring judgement.

Yet every single brit willing lay life AZ. company none heard last year. company failed every single country. give provided UK bull.

AZ always shady continue shady. dumping shit rivers. making shady deals certain countries. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

In words, *not* case, people feared, virus still infects vaccinated people unvaccinated, feel it. Rather, preventing infection except breakout cases. vast majority breakout infections still asymptomatic. spread virus infected it. Otherwise viral load high enough spread.

Further, already know asymptomatic already greatly reduces chances spreading virus infected. lot diseases newborns catch can't vaccinated yet. Statistically, ""coronavirus vaccinated person"" extremely low list. newborn significantly greater risk catching flu person coronavirus vaccine catching coronavirus.

The mobile teams across country begin actively searching people risk vaccinating today. emphasis cantons highest incidence mortality.

As Monday 31st, new Vaccination Plan start ; details yet given. process, Garz√≥n said, ""comprehensive"", since include placement formulas also epidemiological surveillance , early detection diagnosis.

The plan three phases: Save Lives, Take Care Reactivate.

Lasso's website indicates use 2 100 health centers country. one, 43 people would immunized day (five every hour one every 12 minutes). way, 90,000 citizens reached every day; added together give 9 million vaccinated 100 days. specified whether two doses.

The contagion curve slight drop

The risk contagion remains high country: 28 100 processed samples positive, average. 18 provinces exceeded 30% positivity, end partial state exception.

The country accumulated 419,198 cases confirmed PCR tests , Monday 24.

In general terms, contagion curve achieved slight deceleration , April 23 - began govern confinement 16 provinces [the lockdown/curfew]- last Monday.

In 32 days, increase new cases 13%, four percentage points less period prior partial isolation. However, measurements, average number new cases per day still 1,600.

An indicator allows us know clearly evolution pandemic percentage positivity virus. north-central Amazon , seen, example, Pastaza registers 43 positives every 100 samples processed. According World Health Organization (WHO), 20 risk high.

On coast, Santo Domingo province affected, rate 40%, followed Manab√≠ Santa Elena, El Oro Los R√≠os. Throughout Sierra, highest percentages found Cotopaxi, Loja, Ca√±ar Carchi.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* nowhere near Canada would put misinformation regarding covid restrictions. Restrictions Canada pretty severe many provinces. example, Ontarios winter surge winding premier lifted restrictions cases quickly went back up. resuming lockdown cases dropped drastically. 
The reason case rates low last summer last spring severe restrictions US Canada. low case counts lifting restrictions. example, ontario dropped days 100 cases. lockdown last spring severe, almost businesses closed. Across border Michigan also case. days cases around 100. populous US cities major restrictions. fact many states cities stay home orders. restrictions loosened case counts low therefore took surge. matter fact look individual states ie Florida Texas last summer surges many restrictions. forced biggest restrictions date cases dropped. Matter fact Florida actually closed bars believe last summer haven‚Äôt done since. point lot less covid spread last year, mainly hot spots fee cities, spread widespread thought Canadian provinces US states, however cases recently dropped Canada US countries well vaccinating populations. experimental serum.

And that's really need know know ignore them. deliberate word choice, ignorance. OK, can't speak NZ OZ, Japan also testing reporting. height pandemic, Japan Testing 30,000 people day nationwide country 126 million. Now, severe 3rd wave, they're testing 60,000 people day nationwide. 8,000 people day populous prefectures (Tokyo &amp; Osaka). Meaning lot people getting possibly dying COVID-19 without even reported. test people post mortem, there's way know. desperation keep economy going (not mention Olympics) that's done that. 

But yes, China bad. spent several years China witnessed government cover bad things want public know. say they're bad, mean I'm saying true. agree. smoke weed help issues, however also became bit crutch limited ways too. Definitely give take one needs able balance. Occupy right idea implemented interesting concepts terms organizing street level. organized enough solid enough vision legitimize movement translate political representation platform. flamed sent cops parks. thrombosis happens 6-24 days injection, stay alert go hospital symptoms. media CDC OWNED, duh. totally agree understand...as hard is...they want feel disenfranchised, depressed, way won‚Äôt realize them. generation hope. Don‚Äôt give up, get mad, get loud don‚Äôt settle shit!!! That‚Äôs like 3000 people entire US population vaccinated.  Holy shit teacher charge children Florida 170 deaths per 100,000
Hawaii 35 deaths per 100,000

Total deaths:
Florida: 36,580
Hawaii: 493

More Sure thing. form find study PDF file, article link it. also gives examples reduced transmission, study Israel shows significant reduced viral load breakthrough people realize much lost stop virus 99.5% survival rate among young people.

As someone lost 3 friends age 30 course pandemic, think notion ""overreacted"" what's going make unhappy. fairness, outdoor mask mandates bit silly begin with. personally would prefer Northern VA area MD. (Again, afford higher COL.)  ask... would make happy? I've asked 12 yr old can't respond. wants left alone, phone. point park want lay rest. want open understand them, like Jane Goodall studying chimpanzees, but--like Goodall's primates--they never understand you, want to. ""CDC monitoring systems found cases would expected population"". quote article: news station needs clicks. one comparing past flu season deaths children current covid deaths children accusing cherry picking data back assertion covid demonstrably worse flu. That's rich. graduated college 96 recession. Lived L.A riots Rodney King. 
3 wars, kuwait, Iraq Afganistan.

My whole life adolescence adulthood, (Just turned 47) nothing racial conflict illegal wars.

The sad part learning.  

Rinse repeat. Rinse repeat. hopelessly controlled others? Forced nonsensical positions need react others? appreciate response understand way worded led discussion specific wording. however, wording ""may"", ""seems to"", etc. led questioning more, lack data numbers. Basically statement without data therefore searching specifics. also clearly may also searching wrong things. 

If send study get moment would great. 

Thanks again! remember homework preschool, short article squirrels answer like two questions draw squirrel. I'm pretty sure even collected. One thing learn ""the game life"" race. people circumstances work let get house they're 24, others wait they're 34 like husband did. people circumstances force kid they're college (rather, choose terminate deal consequences) others undergo IVF they're 40. people luck high paying career high school, others get unexpected laid change careers turn 50.

There's one right timeline, one right way adult, *especially* Millennial.

Don't feel guilty success. understanding success anomaly privilege something everyone else able easily replicate. That‚Äôs exactly feel. outside - least like fancy - appear somewhat normal. However inside everything completely broken like shattered mirror. Sounds like maybe leaky gut something it? 

Do know obese people serious Covid outcomes? I‚Äôm wondering poor diet (and resulting leaky gut) could large factor this. Also since tends hit minorities harder, happen lower income eat processed foods, might something there. idk live California coronavirus-related subs, whenever kids brought up, chimes parents probably let kids leave house year say they'll continue they're vaccinated. keep arguing can't reopen children vaccinated, refusing understand risk severe complications able-bodied kids exceedingly rare. get it, child want take risk. responsible. let leave house sometimes, rest world gonna move on.

I'd argue types parents wayyy harm children psychologically COVID would kids physically. They're not. People ignore miss signs. think dad's attitude specific small group Gen X people, he's kidding himself. one else (*especially* Boomers) think way.

they making money kids, made money &amp; left kids rot dying planet.

Thanks :) personal perspective: deal SwitchHealth's quarantine measures April, drove Toronto Ohio back get Pfizer shots. goddamn nightmare. test kit pickups weekends. at-home test administered via video chat, site kept crashing.

We see struggling too. Hopefully something change. üíú nowhere near Canada would put misinformation regarding covid restrictions.

I never said anything restrictions Canada. 

The situation Texas Florida really relevant radically different climate compared Canada Europe. mentioned it, might worth noting Texas lifted *all* restrictions March 2nd, case count dropped 76% since then. Anyway, look data, plenty examples, mainly Europe, cases dropped towards summer independently restrictions. 

This something I'm making up, loads research subject, [this yes, vaccines massive impact well. Israel virtually transmission anymore. Since massively *eased* restriction people (even unvaccinated ones) late April, case incidence continued drop 75%, like Texas. mental health pandemic going ravage country thanks exponentially increased covid.

Do know much guilt comes along telling friends bought house 24? even mention one old friends food stamps kid I'm kinda dreading get-together we're soon probably going come conversation.

I think much imposter syndrome survivor's guilt. Sure, always good mantra. However, statement noting virus made lab

AZ two tasks:

 * clinical trials
 * production

I sure outsourced lot it, far worst company really hate kind article titles.. materials, scaling issues etc. know, issues mentioned restrictive months.

What funny joke made. supply issues raw materials know every single entity world except AZ apparently. 

Despite raw material shortages everywhere, one failing bad AZ. Despite AZ fails acknowledge shortcomings. pretty obvious going they're seen British company. That's transparent are. WANT spend time school friends. NEED spend time playing socializing friends. That's human necessity. loss life acceptable, otherwise expose kids danger?

The flu regularly kills kids covid. 

Children's parents grand parents largely vaccinated. I'd like see pathogens survive splash bleach wash water high-temp dry otherwise killed laundry sanitizer. course! Like said, enjoy it. 

And yea polarization gotten pretty bad. try call people overly simplistic tribal things, expense opinions. never relying one company. That's vaccine portfolio, single order.

You **hoped** AZ would deliver hundreds millions doses soon possible. took little longer, companies deliver all, yet silent those. Unless I‚Äôm missing something, there‚Äôs scientific reason restaurants separate vaccinated non vaccinated people there?

Once I‚Äôm fully vaccinated cdc says it‚Äôs non vaccinated people even without mask. 

So segregation? equate therapist shopping going first dates over. third fourth first visit, walking even exhausted went in, gave up. felt like emotionally dumping giving nothing. actually made feel worse I'd spent hour dwelling progress plan work it. Thank you. Everyone saying schools return person learning kids need social distance wear masks everyone vaccinated need read article take heart. positive test asymptomatic, could still affected long covid right? That‚Äôs worries (im vaxxed still) companies make risk assessments. EU same, many deliveries contracted needed population. AZ seemingly deliver promised, self created problem. Well kids can‚Äôt go back school people. hospitals overwhelmed patients.

They overwhelmed COVID patients, general. Now, many places periods filled capacity (though even majority COVID patients), happens many places EVERY SINGLE YEAR. 

Outside NYC, places USA ever overwhelmed, tiny hospitals diverted patients larger nearby saying, excess deaths, hospitalizations, need ventilators, random across world time Covid happened? Come on... give head shake.

Never said that. like keep shifting arguments.


Has AZ asked help production like Pfizer Sanofi Merck? AZ asked help like Moderna Sanofi? like JJ Merck Aspen?

They absolutley refuse realize failing. done nothing try make sure deliver AZ claiming would deliver 30 million mars. (Spoiler failed delivered 3 weeks CEO claiming would deliver 50 milliom april (spoiler failed deliver 50 million last week, 3 weeks after). saying EU made plucked number air. True form suppose. data back claim??? bullshitting Yes, ""recovered"" Covid stats never based people negative tests... many people register positive months recover fully. Cough cough ...

I'll speak mind online, like people, physically go protest unless gets lot worse It‚Äôs uncommon positive PCR months testing positive. patients positive PCR fecals tracheal washes. Americans touchy ""rights"" ""freedoms"" relying masks ""social distancing"" way avoid court cases would (and cases did) result trying restrict people's personal movement. country precedent putting requirements businesses protect public health (food safety, need provide lifeguard, fire safety) saying ""businesses must require masks provide enough space distance big gatherings"" easier telling people stay home. Even states ""mandates"" private gatherings often oversight enforcement. Realistically, every time try enforce something like another chance court strike restriction completely. saved egregious cases rather checking many cars driveway. wrong inherently bad thing CDC says lot things, including [cook eggs yolk white  started college student support center campus.

If went speak friend's funeral, would introduced ""Lt. ___."" almost formal social context, referring someone military rank perfectly acceptable; title different Doctor, Father, Sister, etc.

The sound issue me.

Do actually know intent people involved. say certainty individuals convinced leadership team, built proposals, drove projects, executed deal solely intention adding AZs pocketbook.

There two problems world view. first, seem create distinctions company individuals run it. AZ took big risk this, effort led individuals. claim know true intentions, say know profit wrong.

The second, whether motivations effort good gain long term (we know), know short term intentions clear. able provide low cost vaccine millions. noble intention. know virulence severity. fairness goals assists stats year ridiculous again. Wash U time machine?   That's bad excuse. butthurt Brexit, wanting doses paid for. soon half year since vaccine approved, still hardly improvements seen. AstraZeneca handled manufacturing communication much worse company supplying EU.

It delayed vaccination process significantly, resulting many deaths additional months able go back normal. really think AstraZeneca British?

// Swede criticizing Anglo-Swedish company confidant shouth usually mean  they? Looks like cases got slight bump beginning month lowest they've 7 months Aren‚Äôt mRNA vaccines totally different flu vaccines? effectiveness another level, effectiveness variants great (so far). I‚Äôm saying won‚Äôt need boosters, keep seeing vaccines compared flu vaccine, far less effective.

We‚Äôre still dealing tail end smallish 4th wave due UK variant, virus levels community continue decline vaccinations county 70% first shots. doubt outdoor mask requirement stick much longer. Indoor masks still strongly recommended Public Health due higher case numbers, mandated; case rate dropping, quickly compared areas.

Summer fine, it‚Äôs drought year wildfire season could really suck. hey, we‚Äôve got plenty masks smoke‚Ä¶ China banned domestic flights, banned international flights time. don‚Äôt see anybody defend that. matter factory made it? I'm fairly sure production outsourced, India plants. see going sub contractors.

The fact AZ delivered second highest number doses globally(unless charts I'm seeing excluding russian/Chinese vaccines) therefore deserves huge credit efforts ending pandemic.   skip yesterday??   conflating two things: genetically engineered virus China (this condemned) may accidental lab leak (always plausible, actual evidence come light) Yay, P ! definite coronavirus potent, viral dose lethal spread non-vaccinated person?  AstraZeneca company, like want maximize profits. agree humanitarian basis, rather thought company would gain long run - either PR eventually able sell vaccine profit.  That's always intuitive me. getting actual virus would cause body create perfect immunity virus compared vaccine. seem exactly case head makes perfect sense. would show us EU citizens actually matter first step towards playing big global player game.

Also EU would considered right this. US considering litterly nothing. second shot, I‚Äôd hanging friend, working project every day first ten days second shot, got sick tested positive. went got tested couple times following week, negative. 

There plenty exposure period time second shot positive test. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure even though didn‚Äôt full two weeks second shot, vaccine still helped prevent spreading me. 

So I‚Äôm pretty confident vaccine. But, never really think know better experts spent lives studying developing shit.  No, it‚Äôs scientists able look virus say almost certainly wasn‚Äôt manufactured. agree confusion. Again, seems like could really easy figure data coordinated concerted effort so. either purposefully greying up, incompetent enough trying pick data. Looking total order alone highly mis leading. need consider delivery time lines. UK due 30mil last year received approximately zero.

You also need consider order 1/4 size supply chain greater than. 1/4 EUs.

The UK order massively behind despite head start.

I deny EU order worse state claims EU politicians AZ delivering UK divert EU complete bollocks. thought beginning pandemic, scientists concerned COVID 19 would drastically different.

Science inductive, deductive. never 100% positive *anything* science, everything one piece evidence away upended. number interesting recently difference ""spread vs symptoms"" based vaccine type. seems like mRNA (Pfizer/Moderna) versions great preventing spread, inactivated viral ones (like Sinopharm/Sinovac) aren't.

Obviously, extreme comments like u/GrammerSnob 's thread ""0%"" stopping spread ridiculous, lack spread prevention places like Seychelles also real.

If bout illness, sure stay home well, otherwise carry on. waters muddied vaccinated people offering lot protection unvaccinated, hence case numbers dropping cliff. general X number covid cases, assuming people vaccinated. would simply multiple efficacy vaccine figure many vaccinated would gotten infected. Long story short ""breakthrough"" cases roughly match measured vaccine efficacy, always comes somewhere around 95% mRNA ones. words low F.  Different metric.

I couldn‚Äôt find English page Number plenty German one uses think history look back measures took 'protect children' disease less lethal common flu barbaric. numerous reasons, 0.01% figure taken probability catching COVID given vaccinated.

If subject agree verb, get question right SAT/ACT. I'm sorry burst bubble.

I believe correct noun refer dog ""cat"" want; I'm still incorrect. absolutely problem believing vaccine reduce transmission rates due multiple factors. Either viral load reduced therefore transmission harder, asymptomatic means body suppressing virus/are less likely spread means coughing/sneezing.

What problem wrapping head around vaccination effective apparently positive rate 0.01% fully vaccinated individuals? 

First all, way value indicative true value. suggests definitely prevent able get infected certain degree pretty obvious already. However, think 0.01% misleading value. many asymptomatic cases slipped crack? many ways value gross representation actual infection rate.

However, important thing think gather based data, certain level protection COVID absolutely clear fully vaccinated watched parents aunts uncles retirement ruined pandemic. big plans enjoy golden years travel events, year later many coming much worse shape. facing reality don‚Äôt many good years left lost significant chunk sitting inside. plenty examples round world places simply experience can't dismiss telling ""oh guess tracing good ours"".

There countries world used zero-Covid strategy. vast majority countries used mitigation strategy moved lockdowns hundreds thousands cases prevent hospital systems collapsing. 

It nothing contact tracing. better anywhere else. fact multiple reports found contact tracing quite poor would overwhelmed quickly major outbreak. 

There really one strategy works finding outbreak still single individual family two people using contact tracing, gone instantly locking staying locked certain every contact found. Waiting day two means even longer lockdown needed, waiting week two late months long Melbourne style lockdown work, that. strategy finding cases asap. Taiwan, measures worked great multiple times longer did. even managed avoid lockdown entirely, unlike Australia Nz. bit stretch assume system inherently less effective Australia's.

Taiwan's strategy concerning since beginning. I've amazed outbreak earlier lack testing lockdowns. current outbreak proven weakness systems. talking last year.

Last year Melbourne learned hard way elimination approach. big outbreak also opted mitigation/suppression strategy shunning full lockdowns. trying avoid lockdown long made control lockdown months.  Since embracing elimination massive outbreak again. say GIGO ... Please consider due transmissability covid vaccination percentage needed herd immunity higher illnesses. ...

I'm sure ""most illnesses,"" herd immunity threshold higher commonly known diseases like measles, mumps chicken pox since higher estimate 65% threshold Covid based assumption R0 around 3. I'm worried immediate reason quote. flip side, know what's chance long term effects flu vs. covid. That's I'm worried - mRNA vaccine mind better alternative real virus. Nice.

I agree social media bad students mental health, never see talk kids give social life, sleep schedule, passions hobbies different reasons. Maybe school, pandemic, social media, home problems, etc. friends feel silenced, main response problems advice judgement, emotional support.

And lot us scared seek support, judgement worry financial burden parents. certain things want keep private, since we‚Äôre kids, word get around parents it‚Äôs relatively hands knows. don‚Äôt want lose control another aspect life.

Obviously benefits still outweigh risks. Exactly. Figuring origin jack shit help fight it. get revenge whatever we're pandemic.  easy crunch numbers come scientifically valid conclusion, main reason would compare two demographically similar groups -- vaccinated unvaccinated people. states applied different criteria states vaccinated high risk job people people first (healthcare essential workers, etc.), plus older people. right bat get meaningful result say real-world efficacy comparing unvaccinated people. Second follow people know vaccinated, compared people two groups tested positive. people exactly know keep track dates well enough separate two groups -- make sure mixing partially vaccinated people either group.

So far Israel done real world efficacy calculation 1.2M people (600K vaccinated/600K unvaccinated, demographically similar). possible keep centralized health records state US does. results similar Pfizer Phase 3 trial results.

Instead produce anything scientifically valid, headline simplistic dumb calculation number vaccinated people tested positive divided number vaccinations. comparative result really tell anything vaccine effectiveness (though guess we're supposed feel meaningful?).

So, ""infected?"" consider such, since know viral load spread others, mean consider failure vaccine? 

The likely answer no, vaccine effectively stopped cluster tracks.

Like, totally understand trusting government. really do, feel like pretty blind trust US government.

*however* mRNA vaccine clearly gene therapy. designed gene therapy way hide gene therapy.

So argument strikes argumentative sake arguing. also fine literally lives line. anti vaccine can't collect VICP hey man I'm you. COVID vaccine included VICP. call gene therapy actively misleading people something *clearly false* *clearly* designed scary sounding possible. lying, know lying, result people literally dying result willful lie.

It bothers me. Right? People seem one track mind understanding works. ""Virus can't kill me, need vaccine."" ...like what? really besides change leave mess clothes behind? Meanwhile ontario   said week ago, bears repeating...

It's almost vaccines work!!!!!!!! seen humanity pandemic? Even gotten everything completely right beginning, nothing would've changed huge % people morons. India US Brazil places in-between, leaders general public made ridiculously stupid decisions again. ever get highly-contagious virus much higher death rate, we're screwed. learn anything this. John Hopkins University says US 7 day average 50Cases per 100000. Yeah EU demanding doses expense elsewhere, taking doses USA example means go Latin America sorely needed, even EU donate back wasting precious time many countries relying AZ EU looking pinch doses have. We've known year low risk surface transmission yet every business spent year talking new cleaning protocols, like meant anything.

But agree. idea many people Covid, recovered, data reflects positive test results. test communities get one number. limit tests three verifiable symptoms (my town) get vastly higher percentage positives. Since published data combines lists results, idea actually means.

So, accept job pays less comes things make difference. get 10k year (untaxed) maxing employer-matched contributions 401k also enjoy benefits healthcare plan negotiated large group (even small business 25 employees families get large savings compared individual, even open marketplace facilitated ACA).

So, no, don‚Äôt *absolutely* need rely employer healthcare. *affordable* healthcare many. Examine cost COBRA healthcare plans, example. Anecdotally, mother retired early start pandemic. enough years service (in company eliminated option grandfathered in) could keep employer-negotiated healthcare would pay 50% reached age Medicare would take (which taxed income). pays $500 month healthcare plan, amounts almost 20% net income. Also, large deductible visits/medication/tests, paid (the remaining) income.

Without employer, medical costs would easily exceed 50% income. considered ‚Äògood‚Äô healthcare ‚Äòdesirable‚Äô compensation career city mid-high COL.

This means healthcare tied job. gone long, actual wages depressed (along across board stagnation). cannot find job pays 25% want purchase healthcare. now, healthcare taxed income monetarily tied income (‚Äújob‚Äù) now.  feels like every state country lifted mask mandate (or set concrete date so) already, still end sight Oregon. concrete date, plans, *anything*. Even mask mandate lifted fully vaccinated people encouraging, businesses verify vaccination card go maskless, vast majority businesses want hassle. feel isolated rest country, jealous read stories y'all going places without restrictions.

There's pretty huge difference looking scapegoat failings looking cause figure happened I‚Äôm pretty sure also don‚Äôt know fully process trauma certain age That‚Äôs almost happened Pfizer didn‚Äôt join party. Biontech vaccine developed Biontech , Pfizer Fosun Pharma, Chinese company. Pfizer rolled China name Fosun-Biontech vaccine Things rough little one. 3.5, back pre school since July.

But still struggling. bad days would expect age. ADHD/anxiety evaluations done (waiting results). clear us preschool teacher stalled socially. Academically fine, ahead bit even. socially/emotionally, struggling again. 

Been working things best can. super hard us too.    Lmao know stupid article. people didn‚Äôt feel safe wouldn‚Äôt go.  mean it‚Äôs pretty obvious came UK 35%+ population fully vaccinated lockdown last week. hand, got J&amp;J vaccine

This thing ""fully vaccinated"" thing. J&amp;J one dose pretty much comparable AZ first dose lower efficacy one dose Pfizer/Moderna. tested one dose regimen, fully vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna not. Pretty much every country restrictions place.

Many even permit tourist travel general. two paragraphs press secretary reassuring. information (regarding possible side effects) would say f that. 
Perhaps said "" numbers low currently primarily impact males"" CDC along various agencies looking expect answers next days"" % placebo group infected time? think getting me.

If enough people say they're done, matter virus fall. gone long enough lot people simply cannot afford again.

Do honestly believe government, anywhere country, going able put distancing/closure restrictions without massive pushback? dearth testing early on, probably lowest numbers year. absolute numbers undercounted, estimate numbers.

It‚Äôs special trick called Bayesian statistics allows one indirectly calculate cannot directly calculated.

Here‚Äôs works: 
Let‚Äôs say two different situations going on. first situation we‚Äôll call A, means person contracted COVID. second situation we‚Äôll call B, means person wants get tested COVID.

Obviously want chance (or probability) person contracted COVID. We‚Äôll call P(A), said ‚Äúthe probably A‚Äù. person must get tested, everyone wants gets tested. calculated those. 

For first one, say that‚Äôs probability contracting COVID ‚Äúgiven‚Äù got tested, P(A|B)‚Ä¶ P(A).

For second one, say that‚Äôs probability someone wants get tested P(B), calculate population data.

The trick something called Bayes‚Äô Law says P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)‚Ä¶. need P(B|A). What‚Äôs that?

That‚Äôs probability someone get tested given they‚Äôve contracted COVID. test people don‚Äôt want get tested? answer hospital. one checks hospital, get tested whether want not. hospital confirms whether person COVID, P(B|A) less calculated.

Now P(A|B), folks getting tested; P(B) population data; P(B|A) hospitals, calculate P(A), estimated chance *any* person contracted COVID.

In real time, it‚Äôs bit involved that. that‚Äôs general way calculate good statistics can‚Äôt measured directly.  aka livestreams. livestreams already. see many people getting infected, does. family friends Brazil know tons people COVID themselves, cases recent weeks. didn‚Äôt matter time

People deplatformed banned views 'didn't matter.'  
 ridiculous. Get Tylenol beforehand! Don‚Äôt *take* beforehand need it, since going store difficult haha. Taking fever got bad relieving months 2021 still can't get deliveries time anyone UK.

End April approx 50m UK 350m else where.

AZ busy working production partners US, Mexico, Argentina, UK, EU, India, Australia probably more.

Huge effort deserving huge credit. Total bs mask mandate hasn‚Äôt lifted. TN nowhere near 70% cases deaths plummeting. ‚ÄúWe lied, cheated, stole"" - intelligence community. discussion stories. state opinions. spare ya rest, suppose. shared yet, so... Maybe stop jerk it? Curious: part dislike more: ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù ‚Äúserum‚Äù? conjunction? Americans going stop sending kids school every winter want consistent. [Russia, China sow disinformation undermine trust Western vaccines: says AVAILABILITY health services opposed efficacy existing services.

Availability proper health services modern countries often underwhelming, know why, maybe something thecontextofpoliticMONEYMONEYMONEYMONEYMONEY equally unfactual ""vaccines prevent passing someone else"" Stop wasting money lol, whole world knows China it. shit, half trauma isn‚Äôt even mine. glued onto parents, whose parents passed onto change point, matter look protect adults protect kids became clear likely get sick.

And thus concern spreaders hits lot differently every adult get vaccine...makea wonder school districts still considering virtual options fall...

If adult vaccinated, you. Get vaccine, kids (a lot ages get vaccine now) spreader threat you. Well, may change... anyone link CDC report? article uses ABC news links reference. appreciate feedback reassurances. Thank guys. Here, here's wayback machine page: here's saying back Although COVID-19 vaccines effective keeping getting sick, scientists still learning well vaccines prevent spreading virus causes COVID-19 others, even get vaccinated COVID-19, may still exposed virus causes COVID-19. exposure, people infected ‚Äúcarry‚Äù virus causes COVID-19 feel sick symptoms. Experts call ‚Äúasymptomatic reason, even vaccination, need continue using tools available help stop pandemic learn COVID-19 vaccines work real-world conditions.  Ahh gotcha.

That‚Äôs good stuff. Good glad agree! continue clean, chose never clean anything ever again. That‚Äôs beauty charge lives.  surprised pikachu face 70% gotten first shot, wait month get 70% fully vaccinated. Unless there's huge influx J&amp;J 1-shots (which low supply PA), can't get 70% vaccinated faster even every unvaccinated person decided sign tomorrow.  Fister Roboto. missed senior summer break + entire freshman year college. Everyone get's experiences once, missed chances. hope sophomore year ladder half summer make it. Hi! told remember post, did. 

I know mid-summer yet, wanted share weeks check again! vaccines good covid preventing covid. Good. today, one them. hope turns zoonotic accident makes much tragic. I‚Äôm really interested straight appeals authority though, I‚Äôve seen enough eminent scientists (including like Elbright Rutgers previously convinced zoonotic) speak need take lab leak hypothesis seriously know it‚Äôs total crank low-IQ view. course position US government appears be, per Biden‚Äôs statement today, theories equally likely point. again, I‚Äôd much like read good rebuttal Wade‚Äôs article, haven‚Äôt seen anyone make similarly thorough explanation case zoonotic . don‚Äôt dog fight, hope get bottom it.

That's mNRA vaccines compared unvaccinated. can't use breakthrough numbers efficacy low spread lack cases unvaccinated people, time delays. 
 
There's low spread many places (and yes, part vaccines, way vaccines help!). many unvaccinated people getting it, can't assume vaccinated people getting vaccines. 
 
time delays: 
 
For example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months. 
 
The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good.  I'm looking New York... Get shit together evidence suggesting educational deficits due virtual learning lead lifetime lost Covid would have. 

A large Dutch study concluded children learn anything distance learning, actually regressed. [will offer Johnson Johnson coronavirus vaccine anyone arrives benefit anyone wishes get vaccinated arrive here. trials showed 95%. can't use breakthrough numbers low spread lack cases unvaccinated people, time delays.

1) There's low spread many places (and yes, part vaccines, way vaccines help!). many unvaccinated people getting it, can't assume vaccinated people getting vaccines.  
 
2) time delays:

For example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months. 
 
The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good. number nearly high enough useful. logistics hard part. weird thing see meme ends spectrum. talking covid denier anti-vaxxer work repeated whole symptoms meme, also see zero-covid Twitter people also repeat it. 

It‚Äôs bizarre unproductive version shaking hands meme sides don‚Äôt get it! following rhe science. Also Trump proposed early limelight one thing changed.  what? mean complete sincerity, caution plan foreseeable future different 2019 order protect others?

I ask I'm genuinely interested would like know things plan short term long term order that.

I want make sure I'm clear since know tone difficult convey typing, I'm trying come rude condescending asking this. legitimately want know plan cautious, long plan things, would like see average Vaccinated person order cautious well. Yeah, nothing stopping people baselessly suing anybody want too. ‚ÄúThe CDC report notes certainly underestimate breakthrough infections reporting voluntary many asymptomatic cases may never tested. Also, clear study breakthrough infections likely new, concerning variants.‚Äù

The reporting volunteered systematic. Israel reports systematic gave % infections spread consistent Pfizer testing data. saying.

Don‚Äôt see happening good while, I‚Äôd guess fall? doctor would ever allow this?

What security detail would ever allow this?

I British seems like idiot times. However, can't see anywhere near reality. late, honestly. Let rephrase don‚Äôt get another commend deleted:

Why pretending two options? entire year criticism lockdowns met hostility bans. Valid criticisms lumped conspiracy theories. lockdown skeptics, one ‚Äúpro-science‚Äù crowd. vaccine situation quite well. Compared supposedly well organized EU using large size purchase bulk. Living hardest-hit province (Alberta), I'd say bit both. locked December much gentler slope. leadership failed act way late. Luckily started hitting 40-50% single-dose vax numbers around time combination enough reverse skyrocketing case trend. Yeah, million dollars rounding error state government. lot, think nothing spending million dollars. feel really bad Canadians. Yes, someone severely medically fragile certain types immuncompromsied may able handle it. seen overseas people ill handle took led deaths due immune response. Allergies/severe allergies another factor. side immunocompromised, take vaxx straight doesn‚Äôt work body something wrong immune system can‚Äôt create antibodies properly. make several types antibodies peoples systems ‚Äúbroken‚Äù bodies don‚Äôt make appropriate ones response. possible get Hep greens herbs (probably due open defecation field workers nobody wants hear realities food production United States supplier countries) people indeed get way.

I say somebody germaphobe things like reasonably clean public transit, public bathrooms etc. Washing produce good sense. (Also, pesticides) guess Melbourne's experience showed weaknesses Australia's system subpar contract tracing.

Contact tracing state health departments federal. standard Victoria baring, cannot used indicator standard NSW.

Infact, NSW attacts best public health professionals invested strategically health better contact tracing teams best public health professionals build careers Sydney Melbourne. never real lockdown Sydney, 2 3 weeks mask mandates whole pandemic amazing survalance testing (i.e. sewage) contact tracing, we've international arrivals closed borders least Australia giant margin. 

Claiming contact tracing pointless beyond ridiculous. medications seen large uptick last year?  People downvote you, look countries like, know, New Zealand, lockdown financially supported government even last six weeks. countries like Iceland, South Korea, Norway, Denmark, took steps mitigate COVID without using long-term lockdowns. good excuse, routes could taken.

Why many people seem think option nothing? Thank article long winded. definitely applied China. numbers way accurate. There's definitely way dead infected officially reported per government suppression China.   stopped getting vaccine. trying safe possible since one us higher risk. really.  

Locally San Francisco Bay Area most, almost all, cases localized zip codes neighborhoods. random sample completely miss magnitude problem areas. Instead realized aggressive contact tracing treatment rather wasting resources areas better position handle virus. Yes is.  Stupidity. what‚Äôs behind hesitancy. faster comes faster goes. basic stuff dude. think literally everyone get infected? stop sadistic fool Sinovac stopped shipments sudden Turkey backup. I‚Äôm sure would done big deal Sinovac delivered vaccines. obviously BioNTech better herd immunity. paid around 2 euros dose want 10 euros PER DAY delayed dose.

Well, damage caused additional month pandemic missing vaccinations pretty high.  2 3 weeks still long time struggling kids kind like whole super mom trope (""mom amazing, EVERYTHING!"") - yeah, well mama's also burnt exhausted too. 0 cases treatment group, 4 cases placebo group. That's enough data say 100% efficacy. AZ cancel orders, refund EU refuse contracts. possible someone allergy one vaccine ingredients.  I'd say kids resilient degree mundane stuff highly depends adults around them. example, let's say child really excited going zoo birthday, ends rainy day. opinion, best thing parent validate emotions (""It's okay upset looking forward this"") try help child ""solve"" problem (""Do want go somewhere else something else that's special?""). Allow express emotions appropriate way also make sure understand sometimes things happen way want.

However, global pandemic life disappointments. Hell, lots adults coping well this, certainly expect kids resilient right certainly schooling social disruptions. Kids handle people think handle, applies everyday frustrations (and assuming loving home life), something like this. data actually even messier would understand.

Case counts great measure overly high PCR cycle thresholds catching people neither ill contagious. 

Death counts great measure terrible job differentiating ""Died *from* COVID"" ""Died *with* COVID"" 

Hospitalizations also somewhat problematic counting beds COVID-positive patients means count whole bunch nosocomial cases *and* count people hospital something completely different, *while* happening test positive. Got jab hour ago, better effective :p filthy  articles continue always bullshit. It‚Äôs complicated. theater open town want go see movie, go theater good time. WTF? wonder pizza place eat cost Uber delivery guy gets penalized. Ohio idiotic legislature time. really hope vote people lot state votes party line pay attention stuff. Well also enough toilet paper build new house it?? lived poverty kid suffered abuse never knew truly awful world became adult, always hope sitcom family/house/job/happy ending future. social media 10 year olds ""all lost"" moment 22. Even adult feel helpless, can't imagine anyone still devoloping brain could see shit see keep going. Well real question wahr hate more? Thick necks leaving weights stuff orrrrr weight hoggers? Guys 3 different weights.. ""Virtually zero"" zero. death child devastating preventable, prevented. sure that's even conversation needs happen. dealing novel coronavirus pandemic midst initial outbreak, completely acceptable take precautions time.

No tests cases. fumbled CDC test kit development early policy testing people traveling history China conveniently delayed proper surveillance COVID-19 US easy count. depends many unvaccinated fall. simple count give pretty accurate number infections, no? There‚Äôs smoking gun. simply don‚Äôt know came from, substantial circumstantial evidence linking lab. either way know sure didn‚Äôt go bat human, go another species first. right again? many misses acceptable we‚Äôre measuring accuracy?

Thank much work. could‚Äôve haha. covid early March last year, terrified months I‚Äôd get conflicting info. didn‚Äôt know got it. took awhile break cycle. exhausting. takes minimum 2-6 weeks walking pharmacy, depending vaccine.

I necessarily agree states restrictions, that's answer specific question. really true. lived lockdown new Zealand like 8 weeks - started late March never hundred active cases. US probably many cases January, indication bad things would get. think nationwide lockdown month would've helped like mid January, that's even assuming manage get something going states (probably constitutional). going happen. There's proper lock since got (July 2020), can't speak last spring. 

My wife says never ban, *suggestions*, though lot people took ban. focus personal responsibility common here, guess. point issue blanket apology conspiracy theorists? 

From stand they‚Äôre right often CDC WHO.  Millennials parents now, oldest among us reached promised miserable. succeed massive case imposter syndrome feel like deserve much better peers clearly we're actually better ones still struggling much. Okay, well wearing mask going make safer. almost knew exactly entire world would've imposed travel bans United States. would've known test airports. would've wearing masks planes. Instead idea 2-3 months spread everywhere. this... news? body make specific antibodies combat different viruses already. would Covid different? Indeed, honest I‚Äôm angry embarrassed got injected vaccine. Everything seems terrible it‚Äôs ever getting worse time. Dose 2 definitely cards me, I‚Äôd rather catch mild Covid due protective effect dose 1 suffer 6 weeks anxiety blood clots, seriously fucking joke lab leak true China knew Wuhan would've locked *instantly*. What's percentage people gotten covid second time? mean there‚Äôs millions animal human *novel* coronavirus infections China year. Existing ones perhaps. 

Human error one biggest risks exists. Accidental transmission bio lab animal human always one plausible explanations, virtue lab Wuhan consolidates animals coronaviruses close proximity people. Meh. India reporting factor 10. I'm 35 introvert even really struggled last year, can't imagine hard kids especially need lot social experiences outlets. I'm glad happen even decade ago know would able get things like discord zoom keep regular contact friends family. scheduled weekly game night every Tuesday meet discord play things like jackbox drinks hanging out. Without outlets like probably would lost it. Yup, super worried. remember infamous super bowl Easter surges! need factcheck.org tell whether knowing 1-2 months earlier could saved lot lives. blatantly obvious could've avoided lot mistakes far prepared. You‚Äôre great job getting help needs. Sending positive vibes way.  might genuinely missing something here, study linked suggest epidemiological evidence suggests individuals  
never develop symptoms may likely individuals symptoms  
transmit SARS-CoV-2 others.

Of course, published December widespread vaccine rollout, maybe apply asymptomatic cases post-inoculation? It‚Äôll probably like Measles, it‚Äôs around, people protected vaccines. cases kids antivaxxers didn‚Äôt get vaccinated parents. lucky continue mild children basically cold kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated get immune rest lives. I've seeing similar stories popping, they're US news sources. international cover potential coming lab? hate sketical I'm best Google searching, feels like might bias. least starts getting international pickup. Development education. face face communication. navigating social situations. facing dangerous situations. exploration. experimentation. 

Kids locked inside year+ put pause, brain work like that. One formative years wasted, we'll suffering consequences decades.   I‚Äôm sorry hear this. daughter hospitalized twice 6 months well. similar issues. home, everyone terrified relapse. idea going play trying best doesn‚Äôt always feel like enough.

Stay strong, don‚Äôt forget impact kids gone this. seeing odd behavior oldest towards one this.

Edit. Getting bed terrifyingly hard. luck end, docs said whole system bursting. mention Pompeo claimed months ""credible"" intel virus came lab actually produce   assume lot 0.01% would mild/moderate cases. Would interesting see long term study rate severe infection full vaccination suspect would much lower (obviously, would lot instill confidence people still doubt) Top Men working it. Top. Men.  I'm vaccinated, concerns variants there. really want believe seeing end pandemic, hope everyone gets shots does, shit dies off. vast majority us sane people conspiracy nuts. right, came who's blame blame go around important me. expect report placed desk. would think final report go people matter. That's need find what?

data collection problem? Seriously? anything else?

the politician charge literally said keep boat port let everybody face destiny international waters would've increased numbers

the politician said stop testing testing increase numbers

Brix said saw numbers press conferences politician charge came nowhere. (to say politely)

what article for? I'm sure That‚Äôs pretty big generalization. owe everything public education  got bit b.1.1.7 Michigan style resurgence cases sharply declining literally month so...    possibility good way get piled condemned 

Depends mean ""this"". originated area China? No. biological weapon released world purpose? Yes. ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù enough loopholes fly several jets through. New York‚Äôs outbreak came Europe, travel ban China doesn‚Äôt work countries don‚Äôt follow suit.
Not much would changed everyone piss poor job contact tracing rather take seriously election. seems like bad news face value, actually evidence vaccination program working protecting vulnerable.

20% population received least one dose; great, fairly good BRICS country global average. public education USA dog shit awhile now. Glad that's case (not got sick) sorry misunderstood you. Luckily, like virus transmits 10 PM restaurants, also hitches rides sedans. There's point courting far right UK. Every far right party failed UK elections, believe largest share popular vote ever ~2% (BNP 2010, virtually dead party). Boris successfully courted traditional working class lot UK traditionally vote Labour, 'trump card' long retain demographic keep party power, position leader Conservative party remain intact. noticed *vast* majority times brought up, especially last year, direct response criticisms federal response. 

This also gets meant last sentence, discourse poisoned propaganda, specifically, propagandists pretending ""concerned citizens,"" shown above.  Hospitals, state facilities, nonprofits, profits, understaffed workers underpaid. There‚Äôs mental health crisis enough people organizations willing pay for. Yes, could. EU would simply give patents producers. Sucks AZ, that‚Äôs life. funny certain sections British population spent whole last year talking evil, dishonest man world, people ready believe every accusation makes. 120 millions vaccines vaccinates 60 million people, 2 doses per person.  story June 2020?    Credible sources? New information? aware two doses needed ? reason didn‚Äôt buy bunch shit hadn‚Äôt worked previous year‚Äôs hurricane supplies yet. it‚Äôs time start stocking back year. yes figure came from. However peddled used distract piss poor response many countries. Probably same. 

It's still 100% indications immunity vaccination infection hold well while. 

Only future tell probably decline somewhat could provide protection decades. One reason covid bad one level immunity. Compared say flu people prior exposure similar strains. new York times ever spend time country first? wonder what's real tally US. much higher much lower what's reason behind connected elections. always possibility, since Trump liked decent chunk people rejected matter evidence 80-100 isn‚Äôt gonna happen. misspoke. 50 percent adults. new evidence def investigate it. However used conspiracy folks right point go ""see global attempt take lives"" would know without social media? getting vaccine worth it, even fact dont get panic attack anymore throat gets scratchy. also didnt side effects either shot! Good stuff. BINGO.

This likely lab made, zoological. 

BUT evidence sloppy lab procedures cause spread.

To put US perspective, would CDC discovered virus sloppy lab techs let virus leak accidentally investigating it.

Wasnt created there, contributed spreading faster followed procedures.  Murphy set pattern putting stringent mandates rolling back time. cases really low fall, expect see masking. He's cautious.

I'm still hoping relents summer camps month.   J&amp;J simply humble AZ this. AZ outright denied could problem vaccine concerns raised Denmark Norway. J&amp;J hand canceled rollout Europe CDC EMA investigating possible links blood clots. J&amp;J seems everything promote safety vaccine. Oh, arguing bad faith now. Nice. 

[39.7% Americans *fully* Partial vaccinations count, information currently have. full vaccinations counted, people try count partial ones dishonest. Stop that. 

But yes, around 80% 100% would ideal. then, over. covid time. would get months later laugh ridiculous thought symptoms Probably means nothing grand scheme things. again, like Spanish flu, likely lead people pointing fingers one another years . great unsurprising news, find kind strange author never really defines ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù. They‚Äôre talking specific type immune memory, could see people interpreting it‚Äôs indicative lifelong sterilizing immunity, it‚Äôs not.

Also, sure paragraph makes much sense: studies may soothe fears immunity virus transient, case coronaviruses cause common colds. viruses change significantly every years, Dr. Hensley said. ‚ÄúThe reason get infected common coronaviruses repetitively throughout life might much variation viruses rather immunity,‚Äù said.

We also long-lived B cells common cold coronaviruses too. immunity isn‚Äôt ‚Äútransient‚Äù. viruses evolve enough circulating antibodies wane enough reinfections possible, immune memory sufficient keep infections mild asymptomatic. We‚Äôre already seeing similar process SARS-CoV-2 where, example, adenovirus-vectored vaccines less effective preventing infection South African variant, still effective preventing serious disease. paragraph seems suggest things different SARS-CoV-2 compared common cold coronaviruses, I‚Äôve seen many experts suggest opposite: like common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 continue evolve, reinfections occur hopefully mild people. trump shown barely pay attention intel briefings. whole pandemic response dog pony show try stay elected. Real traction didnt happen Biden came in. Remeber trump claimed Covid cause china also democrat hoax. Let's wait research done scientific community say probable origins. people sides coming presumptive conclusions without research evidence. 

It may intelligence community even Chinese whistleblower/leaker provides evidence.

Either way, I'm glad Biden calling investigation. issue people think waste time align political beliefs. still spray bottle isopropyl alcohol car. boss ordered extras us spray gas pump handles, packages, etc. Healthcare workers?  possibly data pandemic height.  certainly used certain quarters deflect, observation conversation getting shut regardless context.  knew actively covid time quarrantined. Outdoors mostly safe people without active infections. trial results shows data form efficacy. different piece information. fine many folks tried use conspiracies fact. data comes light shows came lab good found thats happened last year. think lot media confusion.

It well established zoological lab leak. evidence lab investigating may contributed spread China China covered Dec.

But lab made people REALLY need stop fucking claiming was. conspiracy exactly that.

TL:DR investigation origin timeline. well established scientific community origins zoological, also established bad lab procedures investigating might contributed spread. lab made virus though.  public never trust epidemiology public health ever again, certainly enough follow restrictions like time.   Best guesses would be:

1) hit hard last year fall / winter much natural immunity

2) Seemed like decent amount travel / movement started back spring vaccines widespread (just observation) always lot tourists around people started feeling safe, I'm sure travel state last year

3) Despite election results, pretty high number conservative / military / evangelical people stalled things bit vaccines. El Paso county large population great vaccine rate account good % cases currently

4) remember right, lot new cases kids -- lot districts stayed in-person hybrid think bigger ones Denver came back person spring, well

So, usual, really knows things would say contributed. Here's hoping vaccine sweepstakes helps! wasn‚Äôt company‚Äôs decision sell cost, Oxfords. Maybe Oregon? Less expensive California, red Idaho, far travel trying maintain connections back home? Idk, spitballing Initially ‚Äúbest effort‚Äù create effective vaccine, realize production par committed 90M Q2 - probably won‚Äôt make, hence EU‚Äôs lawsuit. also ordered 50 million doses Sputnik V vaccine it'll also produced Turkey condition domestic production first used satisfy domestic demand. doesn‚Äôt take years. I‚Äôve seen 15 year olds it. started smoking weed 10?

It harms. Everything risks benefits. It‚Äôs wonder cure everything. Everybody crutch man. it‚Äôs weed, it‚Äôs alcohol, it‚Äôs overeating, it‚Äôs caffeine, etc. people vice cope things. vice makes life easier individual yes could impact positively  Drug use cope exactly good perspective perhaps bit old. 

Here‚Äôs mean: 
When headache, take Tylenol, right? It‚Äôs drug. people drink coffee caffeine help wakefulness keep headaches bay guess. 
Now, don‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt take huge amount Tylenol caffeine help symptoms. No, take prescribed dosage. 

I use medical cannabis cope certain things. cannabis field, it‚Äôs called micro-dosing. control amount intake much send nice intense high little doesn‚Äôt address problem. 

So believe drugs good you, balance. think perspective someone smokes huge blunt gets high ass. That‚Äôs everyone getting high ass great, coping mental health issues. 

I LOVE microdosing makes feel normal, provides relief takes edge off. don‚Äôt everyday would needed to. 

So I‚Äôm asking make blanket statements cannabis use coping bad. It‚Äôs really not. 

Ps. Still unpopular opinion goes psilocybins well.

Edit: wording clarity. OK, work want saying true. 

My concern infant cannot get vaccinated. I'm looking answer ""kids get sick it"" anything along lines, straight want get it.

But I'm seeing anything says reduces spread? I've seen studies saying vaccines ""may"" ""seem to"" reduce spread, nothing definitive yet. 

I'm interested see anything point saying otherwise.

Again, concern vaccinated people carrying it, regardless get sick not, passing little one. Appreciate info throw way. lot countries invested lot money vaccine development. worried getting return time vaccine out, everyone already took foreign shots. PARTY TIME!

Indeed. Go worldometers. Sort deaths/M, everything high group well: death/cases either low declining quickly. areas get 2nd wave: MI, IL, France, Spain appearance wave much weaker first one. Deaths extremely low

Florida Texas affect NY, NJ, CT, MA

Why? look NY,NJ,CT,MA's curves, stayed stably low 3 months despite reopenings despite raging epidemic elsewhere.

I see say Texas Florida though.

Want prediction? month, case death curves TX FL much lower much open CA.‚Äù

You dead wrong probably say spit nothing terrible information, right? Texas Florida shot dramatically. closed shop refrigerators full dead people cities. 

Or science statistics virus change worlds trajectory?

Maybe take overall scope COVID-19 face value. mouthpiece entire world, country city company entire world.

So maybe take hard look research tweets.

That‚Äôs whole point urging caution claims lifelong immunity. You‚Äôre clearly getting it. Fair points. aware quarterly profit figure. also great think absolutely doable. Could enlighten understood ~~lying~~ mistaken long took publicly state that?


You lap dogs like Europe Minister Cl√©ment Beaune also criticised said: ‚ÄúThey spaced ‚Äì scientists told us ‚Äì massively spaced two injections apart ‚Ä¶ mainly depend one vaccine, AstraZeneca. European authority tell us tomorrow, Germany already told us doubts regarding effectiveness people 65.

So two French government officials, seems bit thick requirement French politics.


And accusations EU French UK‚Äôs ability move quickly, Ms von der Leyen told Le Monde: ‚ÄúSome countries started vaccinate little Europe, true. resorted emergency, 24-hour marketing authorisation commission member states agreed compromise safety efficacy requirements linked authorisation vaccine. Time taken analyse data, which, even minimised, takes three four weeks. Yep. article says, eight fully vaccinated Yankees players staff members got infected.

I know exactly many people total, let's say 80. 8/80 10%. That's much higher .01%.

I'll support everyone mess people remotely forced mess life plans. Yeah exactly. Maybe kids resilient Resilient bring gun school. Im layman, Ill offer insight Ive gathered experts...

The mRNA vaccines highly effective (80%-95%) preventing infections (symptomatic asymptomatic). look CDC studies regularly tested healthcare workers look Pfizer's trials Israel rcvd real world data proof that. youre getting infected- youre spreading virus COVID aerial virus.

Also, top preventing majority infections- even someone vaccinated catches COVID, viral load usually severely reduced making much harder spread virus. studies regarding this, Fauci mentioned well.

Nothing fool proof, live community high vaccination rate virus curb stomped level make even less small threat youngsters vaccinated. convince lot close contacts get vaccinated building defensive barrier around kid, say. close contacts arent vaccinated, may want consider wear mask around kids. Everyone's risk level different. 

One issue nearly sterilizing immunity may fade time meaning vaccinated folks could become increasingly prone catching virus suffer severe symptoms due memory cells. Variants also concern, now, COVID mutating significant enough way evade strong effectiveness mRNA vaccines.  Well, maybe person access birth control, health insurance, ability terminate unwanted pregnancy maybe would able choose children life stable? 

No? It‚Äôs money? know much kid costs? know much government actually gives per child? math comes deficit. Waste money time... thing find whole lot nothing... added tossing dry goods closet days avoid wasting water wipe. Still trying mindful much trash create. mostly use wipes things go fridge freezer. Fruit vegetables get washed hand. Yeah absolutely. Thanks advice.  Honestly insanely frustrating would still require standardized testing year. pandemic shined massive light many issues society. Oh, pretty clear that. didn‚Äôt expect virus much different, also didn‚Äôt want take chances say much. 

The biggest issue honestly alarmist people, among others subreddit threw logic fucking window majority pandemic something could clarify? parent part advice judgment really hit home. suggestions parents talk support kids? would like see parents support you? argument places like live wore masks 14 fucking months? ""Just wait two weeks!"" stupid argument political scapegoat. Everyone wore masks. Maybe helped little, guess what? Corona still thing. 30% individuals infection never develop symptoms 75% infectious develop symptoms.

Now everyday struggle I'm sure going turn out. I'm trying that's do.  find day smoking detrimental me. Kills productivity, lots negatives personally me. right bed great. Relaxes lets unwind nice nights sleep top off.

I'm youth 23 though either. younger would sit couch. experience seemed much different going out, creativity, energy speak of.  Thank ‚ù§Ô∏è we‚Äôre together Honestly, thought so, Reddit, never safe assume. complication hard show effective preventing asymptomatic minor disease without testing everyone trial routinely.

But think rollout large scale trial, testing many people trial, many completely asymptomatic routinely tested work. positive rate low, conclude transmission far lower unvaccinated.  Doctors drug companies caused opioid epidemic. Doctors used prescribe heroin cocaine. Doctors aren‚Äôt infallible. used prescribe alcohol too. 

Don‚Äôt think cannabis lobbyists best interest heart.  might cringy first, would recommend trying see anybody know Discord server. I've made effort spend least hour every day maintaining relationships online, I've found Discord effective way start maintain relationships. 

My advice though: pushy. Best friends made day. Look similar interests (gaming big) spend time participating talking interests.

Good luck! another take: get infected takes least 2 days infectious. vaccinated antibodies likely defeat virus much sooner, hence never get infectious. believe wanted produce US, British government happy stopped comment meant reply comment sorry man Yea I‚Äôve seen niece nephews. fianc√© come weekends kids family spend night purely get away parents socialize kids.

Im sorry things hard!!  getting caught scientific language. mistake people make time, experts like Fauci get strawmanned media. scientific world, phrases like ""seem to"" basically saying "" general consensus"", still might rare exceptions.

Definitive wording big scientific world part. thing consider, scientists looking tiny percentage vaccinated people still get infected and/or spread. So, technically possible (albeit rare), use kind wording talking here. Based current evidence, vaccines SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE transmission. completely, 100% stop it. vaccines SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE chances infection, 100% time stop it. 

If like, find study showed vaccinated people around 60% less likely infect people live unvaccinated people. keep mind, also remember vaccinated people significantly less likely catch first place. So, vaccinated people .01% likely catch it, they'd chance .004% infecting someone live (which much different infecting someone spend 14 hours day with). absolutely idea much right dose coronavirus give someone mild case without killing them. comment original comment. Probably means comment regards original comment. That's...that's Reddit works. every comment every post original post comment.

And someone smoked cannabis almost nonstop since 17 years old, I'm legalization anywhere.

That said, comment still nothing factual. opinion all. stop, spit many facts Yeah every chance turning Pyrrhic victory EU.

Please explain Glad worked out. remember running one summer grab paw socks dog pavement hot. That's probably bad thing, model seem worked.

They incentive make doses earn money, companies like Pfizer have. they're company all, strong incentive make doses serve public either, public initiative would. 

It seems got worst worlds. surgical masks acc uncomfortable personally putting cash selling old furniture electronics bag leaving two days deposited account. believe  AZ supplied second-most doses EU. Obviously Pfizer delivered miracle terms large scale manufacturing, simply possible viral vector vaccines (see J&amp;J god Pfizer/biontech moderna.

AZ delivered twice many doses EU Moderna have. let's even get started Sanofi. Yeah, mockdown lol Apples oranges.  teacher smart. agree daughter. even that? really hope find good psych, really helpful. yup right hopeless ones there. find good one, worth it. boss everyone else office buy cheap pair shoes wear inside office leave shoes corner break room.

Thank god lasted week kinda realized excessive anything. nice apples got there. Pity discussing oranges.

Please stop comparing covid flu. lose credibility that. know many pediatric deaths 2020-21 season? One. Compared 195 2019-20.

Yet deaths covid 591k... number would undoubtedly tremendously higher locked down. hospitals would overwhelmed sheer number patients -- exactly seeing happen India well saw happen Italy. yeah, let's accept loss children, well children's parents, grandparents, friends. loss life acceptable you. school staff could still die. Teachers want work start pandemic blame them. kids go several months year without school anyway unless they're year round. think covid serious mean isn't/wasn't. Given kind disinformation fatal, point stop nuisance start act war? Raw materials, scaling issues etc. know, issues mentioned restrictive months. excuse blatant corruption could done much better weren‚Äôt morbidly obese course. I'll admit suspicious aggressive here, there's lot people agenda.

I always want nuanced discussions, gets precluded people trying use vehicle propaganda. apologize came shooting.  come boat parents. Neglected emotionally, functional alcoholism, gaslighting, lies. lies worst. product affair nobody told me, literally treated like bastard without courtesy even telling why. found DNA test see ancestry (because knew lie somewhere, expect me). spoken mom not-dad decade. There's loads more, that's basic story 

I'd also probably dead addict loving grandparents, husband, therapist I've seeing 15 years.

I vowed kid haven't, least hope not. allow express emotions without yelling her. try explain what's going why. allow opinions argue think something fair. 

I hope continue heal wish best. airborne pathogen work way. Coronavirus‚Äô usually studied PL-4 Lab settings.

That includes: positive pressure suits, isolated fume hoods, separating air purifiers, blast proof windows, etc. 

So others go say removing clothes going inside ridiculous,

Keep mind researchers studying virus must maintain precautions.

Excess death followed covid lock step like shadow around country. whole died 'with' covid narrative always disingenuous lie. people died covid reported, less. 

Excess death jumped highest rate since last major pandemic. happened covid ravaged nation case counts rose. Restrictions haven‚Äôt really changed Alberta since basically January around 400 cases daily compared almost 2,200+ weeks ago. definitely think vaccines anything else. low amount doses tge rest world then? keep missing target every month? somehow sore arm second vaccine, hurt like hell first. would be? COVID really bad kill people? Yes majority people die Covid older... odds even 80 year old dying within given, 2 week, 4 week, whatever period use, actually still quite low. Nowhere near 5% odds dying got Covid... look relative, age group. 

Again, yes rare cases breaks leg happens asymptomatic covid... explain hospitals overwhelmed patients. 

Are saying, excess deaths, hospitalizations, need ventilators, random across world time Covid happened? Come on... give head shake. wrongdoing, evidence, they've plenty time hide need to. Yep, exactly works canning brewery work at. also use rings snap cover whole top can. again, beer really poured glass, especially craft beer often live yeast it, small clumps yeast, like see Kombucha.

There's little skew data one direction (""I've vaccinated, must something else, need get tested"") there's little skew (PCR ""tests"" detect active infections differentiate mere presence virus (even incommunicable) test sample. vaccine ever prevent positive ""test"" form, major flaw style ""test."")

But yeah, breakthrough rate going low. new information. mean, guidance fomite transmission always incredibly clear. problem (in view, brought friend) people started adding steps scientific backing scaring people thinking extra stuff reckless. insignificant effect people's mental health already terrifying time.

It's actually simple washing hands touch face eat. people really internalize (as masks come across country) plenty crap spread way. Sadly, due Trump office politicizing public health, followed hivemind characteristics MSNBC / CNN / Left Twitter orbit, questioning part public health response enough get one labeled Trumpoid pilloried such. unlike Pfizer, Moderna even jj seem refuse ask help.

Nope, bad methodology. 

If talking healthy 35 year olds, I'd agree you. we're not. average age COVID deaths near (or often past, places) life expectancy. odds population dying given period time quite high, especially severe comorbidities. Literally majority people move Long Term Care Facilities dead within matter months. people hospitalized already end-stage diseases, sitting ducks nosocomial COVID. 

When add fact places periods time, counted ""probable COVID"" without test due symptoms (symptoms seen issues person may have), get little bad data. 2 week period 

That's done, either. period time ""positive test"" death much longer still coded COVID death (with higher reimbursement odds ICU given week? 

Same problems deaths. 

It's also ICU beds. post-surgical recovery person coded ""case"" reason. acute injury person coded ""case"" reason. millions people infected covid, much evidence 1.)individuals reinfected, 2. succumb second time around. difference dengue covid covid literally pandemic real world data hundreds millions people.

Pretty much every country operating fact didn‚Äôt know Covid was. Many thought beginning virus spread surfaces didn‚Äôt spread asymptomatic. spent months finding virus - spread. point, great way eliminate pandemic vaccinations 

You argue travel restrictions Trump imposed last year didn‚Äôt help likely slowed spread somewhat. didn‚Äôt, else would Biden keep policy along many countries? Thats see happening. 

Just cancel crowds. know thats hard compromise. 

Require vaccination athletes, delegates, judges, workers.  Canada, one feel like people say lowers symptoms forgotten miserable sick feels. wonderful able taste smell. individual's hyper focus mortality metric matters reflects lack perspective. thing case match; many real world studies like this. every vaccinated person sample, find someone ""matches"" closely possible (similar demographics, potential exposure) unvaccinated. That‚Äôs true. Everyone saying China cooperative regarding investigations origin since beginning.

The idea *manufactured* lab deliberately released regarded conspiracy theory.  covid numbers always wildly undercounted many people get sick enough even realize it, stayed home two weeks never bothered getting test confirming.

No. Masks still required us. considering it, waiting cases lower police people.   someone recently Hawaii, outdoor masks required theory. practice, enforced. I'm sure would want delivered.

The question ofc rhetorical, know answer.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Brilliant. both.

It significantly reduces chances infected, makes much less likely severe case *do* contract virus, makes less likely transmit virus others.

We knew first two clinical trials, know third definitively studies conducted. article specifically talking people recovered COVID vaccinated. 

""Together, studies suggest people recovered Covid-19 later immunized need boosters.""

""The result may apply protection derived vaccines alone, immune memory likely organized differently immunization, compared following natural infection.

That means people Covid-19 immunized may eventually need booster shot, Dr. Nussenzweig said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind thing know very, soon,‚Äù said."" can't get again? I'd saying? greeeeaaaattttttttttt realise SII subcontractor AZ right, licenced AZ, yeah call something else vaccine.

AZ set multiple supply chains around world, UK, South Korea, Latin America, China, europe, Australia, contracting India.

In parts world supply chains alright, mainly european one lagging behind due lower expected yields. european story far story around rest world.

It's europe would even use 20 million AZ doses delivered end June anyway european countries limit 60s done then. Neglect actually harmful outright abuse. get infected can't spread virus, right?

Full text: Mexico, lost people Covid almost country, seeing mammoth drop cases deaths, likely result post-infection immunity, vaccines, warming weather proximity U.S.After deadly winter saturated ICUs desperate searches oxygen tanks, Covid clinics closing positivity rate tests, one point highest world, 17%. Hospital capacity, 90% January, 13%.‚ÄúThe drop cases deaths likely combination vaccinations, natural immunity following infection, perhaps also changes season,‚Äù said Emily Gurley, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health. Gurley says vaccine immunity lasts longer immunity infection another wave could ahead.Another explanation Mexico‚Äôs northern neighbor. U.S. rapidly vaccinating better health. means infections headed south greatly reduced. President Joe Biden eliminated age restrictions month supply began outstripping demand, Mexicans began going U.S. get vaccinated.‚ÄúMany Mexicans gotten shots U.S., that‚Äôs sure,‚Äù said Carlos del Rio, epidemiologist Emory University Atlanta. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs combination factors inhibiting transmission.‚ÄùMexico reported 9.5 Covid-19 deaths per million inhabitants week May 23, slowest rate fatalities year 80 earlier year.

**Vaccine Tourists**Mexico‚Äôs vaccination campaign covered 14% population least one dose since began December, according Bloomberg‚Äôs vaccine tracker. strategy prioritized health care workers, elderly teachers.That led hundreds thousands seek shots north. Although exactly many isn‚Äôt known, data offer clues.Passengers flying cities Texas, hot-spot Mexicans looking shots, doubled March February 305,000, according government data. includes Houston, McAllen, Laredo, San Antonio Dallas.Miami saw 76% monthly increase passengers Mexico March. Mexico‚Äôs travel agent association says members sold 170,000 vacation packages people looking fly get shots.When U.S. began vaccine roll-out, Houston Medical Brokers set service help people navigate appointment process.‚ÄúThe word somehow got Mexico people started contacting us vaccination process quite slow there,‚Äù spokesperson said, adding company helped 200 Mexicans book shots.The U.S. also sent millions doses vaccine Mexico Canada.Last month, almost 2.3 million people traveled U.S. Mexico, according data posted Airlines America trade group. next highest country Dominican Republic, 606,000 passengers.And decision Tuesday U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgrade Mexico‚Äôs air safety ranking could reduce uptick traffic Mexican carriers, won‚Äôt impact current routes prohibit U.S. airlines expanding operations country.

**Opening Up**Mexico City, one hardest-hit regions December wave, expecting return ‚Äúgreen‚Äù government‚Äôs categorization, loosest since pandemic began 14 months ago.That means city considering opening schools June even allowing concerts, unthinkable three months ago.The country, officially lost 200,000 people Covid, likely reach herd immunity September, Mexico‚Äôs virus czar Hugo Lopez-Gatell said earlier week. told Washington Post recently half population may antibodies variants haven‚Äôt become dominant strains Mexico.Gurley Johns Hopkins warns relying immunity acquired virus isn‚Äôt good long-term bet.‚ÄúPopulation level immunity infection dynamic - months peak transmission, likely start wane,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúVaccine best strategy keep immune levels population high.‚Äù‚Äî assistance Sebastian Boyd questioning endemic virus really be. think might present certain regions world like polio,yellow fever etc. really sure, virologist. China well now, idea many cases many people died originally containing reason believe China lie numbers. understand taking haughty stance can't proven China lying Covid numbers, people doubting ridiculous. ridiculous history propaganda CCP assume completely honest anything would make China look bad.  Oh boo fucking hoo. didn‚Äôt expect many responses lol. I‚Äôve unhappy teacher since day 1. She‚Äôs older teacher rather set ways. Honestly, suspect she‚Äôs checked job years ago. I‚Äôm thankful daughter‚Äôs teachers next year seem much approachable. Dude, tank empty January, can't even imagine younger generations going right sure, wouldn‚Äôt think anyone would find incongruous though. Canada joined war pretty much immediately. would law unless passed last two months? use blind testing resolve this.

E.g. test 1000 people randomly. scale results up. perfect bad either.  COVID's longer huge threat US now, time politicalize it. Right? didnt see anything convincing linked paper Sore arm, maybe little sleepy. Nothing else either shot think 3.5 million dead (most certainly lower actual), accidental not, move needle international relations I've got bridge sell you. Masks still required. said evaluate July..... thought employment US will, anyway? Employers set conditions employment, like vaccinated. one's forcing get shot. don't, gotta find another job. That's large difference males females. 

Why rate Brussels much lower? 9 people Yankee organization (out 70) test positive vaccination. Make wonder  I‚Äôve trying find number (I admit haven‚Äôt looked hard) stories aren‚Äôt super focused I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna, I‚Äôm exposed, I‚Äôm 90-97% likely catch COVID-19 all?

Then would assume even lower catching communicable amount/infection virus? Couldn‚Äôt engineered research simply escape Lab? Let‚Äôs face it, China isn‚Äôt world leader safety. Says based investigation lab theory found unlikely, zoonotic vector likely, EU USA agrees like lab theory fewer pages theory want ""clarity"" followed whiff whaff people risked lives truth.

I fail see reheating old shit Shouldn‚Äôt default assumption since vaccines work. need evidence people getting infected vaccination? sTrAiN iSsUe people less contagious shorter period time. study shows lower viral load, therefore potentially lower viral dose (those two different) anyone breathe on. Viral load measured log scale (cycle threshold theory log2 scale). Whether lower viral dose leads less severe COVID unknown - everyone sub believes true, evidence supporting (for viruses).  thing Nephew. taking playgrounds parks get house parents hair. Although couple times told leave simply true. Fact Pfizer delivering doses initially promised. **This personal story, bit convoluted, but, sorry; already rewrote comment, ain't again.**

I went this, recently, parents forced go back school year. entirely depends stayed together - case, gaming voice calls.

I used talk 8 guys good old times, pandemic. online classes started, lost touch 1, and, due personal drama, cut ties another 1 - total, 6. Stayed way while, met another 1 gaming. became friends, showed us 2 good guys, so, also became friends.

With that, went 6 9 people, even friendship losses. also became closer people, stayed Discord calls hours day (and still do!); kept contact. Later year, met nice girl who's friend's girlfriend, that's 10. Yay!

Now, went really hard times last year, developed many /r/EyeFloaters eyes (for reason; please fund research), guy's/girl's support great.

It happened without gaming, though. Without it, it'd like first guy lost contact with. question, guy (who talked year), others, exactly like old times.

Nothing changed. still know other, talk like used - except asshole cut ties with, hey, loss. Even then, though, took really large toll mental health - **especially** floaters; theorize happened life proceeded usual, impede using white screens, paying attention class like used to, working bright environments... fun stuff. Even that, took new free time learn programming, quickly, live now, still think I'd trade security vision fixed.

It's definitely hard us, man, especially developed new issues, truly isolated - did.

Life goes on, though. least look back realize good came it. *Freude*  lot tribal sentiments going around whenever got brought up. entirety federal pandemic response ""China It."" People recognized distinct possibility, fucking frustrating like ""hey going this?"" met ""it's fault.""

The degradation discourse surrounding issue result blatant lies past admin. fact grown ass men think putting piece cloth face children several hours good thing fucking mind-boggling me. swear fucking rock could make better decision. Amazing naive people be. Everyone stays home...consider result hospitals, nursing homes, fire departments. would definitely lose power. Probably water. cell service. Good luck driving somewhere every light can‚Äôt buy gas. Etc, etc. investigated found wrongdoing tradeoffs wearing masks. piece fabric across someone's face. shaved, called 'no-hawk' i.e. opposite Mohawk. Definitely different I‚Äôve seen southeastern US! Schools open months vaccines even available. point you‚Äôd barely know anything happened. I‚Äôm happy things open, feel like mask mandates dropped early many places. state less half adults vaccinated there‚Äôs restrictions mask mandates anywhere. friends kids young get vaccinated frustrated feel can‚Äôt safely go places now; many unvaccinated unmasked people.  Right, actually mean?

It means China massive fuck need open facilities inspections. mean 3.5M dead kind important know happen again. Medication alone pretty garbage. Therapy secret best data combination. That‚Äôs everyone needs stop saying *well still get COVID vaccinated* gives incentive get first place. formal collaboration underway North Carolina, Siri &amp; Glimstad attorneys co-counsel case brought last month federal court Durham County Sheriff‚Äôs Department. local attorney participating case, Jeff Dobson, declined comment. plaintiff case, Christopher Neve, directed questions Siri &amp; Glimstad.
After Neve refused disclose vaccination status March, sheriff confiscated badge, gun bulletproof vest placed administrative leave, according complaint. fired later month, complaint alleges.
Durham County Sheriff Clarence F. Birkhead declined interviewed said statement, ‚ÄúRequiring vaccine protects employees covid-19, also provides protection anyone lives in, works in, visits Durham County.‚Äù
The arguments set forth North Carolina complaint mirror outlined letters Siri, sent April 22, presidents Rutgers Princeton University.
‚ÄúICAN received numerous inquiries members regarding mandate, including students attending university, asked send following notice,‚Äù reads letter Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway. urged reconsider requirement students vaccinated arriving campus fall.
A university spokeswoman, Dory Devlin, said policy stands. ‚ÄúLike hundreds public private universities followed lead, entirely confident legal ethical position respect mandating vaccines fight global pandemic,‚Äù said email Washington Post.
Princeton, too, unmoved letter. ‚ÄúWe conducted careful review confident legal position,‚Äù said Ayana Gibbs, university spokeswoman.
Putting ‚Äòyour imprint early area law‚Äô
This month, ICAN updated notice seeking plaintiffs possible litigation, saying ‚Äúno longer accepting cases legal action.‚Äù
Some legal experts suggested group may pulling back accomplished set do. attorneys made mark early legal contest vaccine mandates, commentary well legal communications filings, said Reiss, University California professor. noted lawsuits filed coronavirus vaccine mandates ‚Äúfollow closely Siri‚Äôs piece Stat.‚Äù
Attorney-client privilege makes extent role played ICAN‚Äôs legal team difficult determine, said James G. Hodge Jr., director Center Public Health Law Policy Arizona State University‚Äôs Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor College Law.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre peddling specific legal arguments designed attract anti-vaxxers others might willing listen,‚Äù Hodge said.
ICAN‚Äôs legal team remains active vaccine-related fronts. Earlier month, Siri &amp; Glimstad filed complaint ICAN‚Äôs behalf asking federal court order Health Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra remove finding ‚Äúvaccines cause autism‚Äù communication public.
A suit last year Facebook YouTube said platforms terminated greatly restricted ICAN‚Äôs activities ‚Äî offered window group‚Äôs communications strategy. stake group‚Äôs ‚Äúability reach billions potential viewers,‚Äù said complaint, filed Siri Brehm, along California attorney, federal court California.
Asking court dismiss complaint, Facebook YouTube said acted ICAN ‚Äúspreading harmful misinformation covid-19 could exacerbate ongoing public health crisis.‚Äù
Stripped platforms press case vaccines, experts said, group turning increasingly courts.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs chance put imprint early area law hasn‚Äôt litigated before,‚Äù Reiss said. ‚ÄúAnd context fits beliefs.‚Äù suppose he's sort not-as-socially-conservative well minus courting support far right I‚Äôm aware. I‚Äôm thick research right now. It‚Äôs part reason focusing home purchasing first goal. hubris Ox/AZ even bother respond acknowledge research. Everything team behind AZ vaccine absolutely stinks inflated self importance, including team Oxford particularly Professor Bell. proud one countries supposed finest educational institutes. 

I hope fallout vaccine destroys reputation good Holy shit TIL Yellow Cake Uranium actually thing. makes Chappelle Show black Bush sketch even funnier They're 50% beginning month, gotta chill look bigger picture  Likewise, Kennedy said full approval make legal opposition mandates difficult. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd need go Supreme Court get reversal ‚ÄòJacobson,‚Äô ‚Äù said, referring 1905 Supreme Court decision found states could force residents inoculated smallpox pay fine.
Others said hurdle created emergency use authorization, EUA, rhetorical legal. ‚ÄúThe FDA required much EUA requires full approval,‚Äù said Dan Troy, former chief counsel agency.
But issue never tested, Mello said. ‚ÄúEven legal scholars disagree read regulations,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs great deal uncertainty.‚Äù
A legal warning
One Siri &amp; Glimstad‚Äôs earliest challenges brought county-owned skilled-nursing facility served southern Wisconsin community 160 years.
The 128-bed Rock nursing home 15 cases coronavirus two deaths, said Rock County Administrator Josh Smith, prompting leaders require staff vaccinations. memorandum issued shortly Christmas noted failure comply would ‚Äúresult employee laid off,‚Äù eligible return vaccinated.
Of nearly 200 workers, 16 layoff status, Smith said.
Representing Rock employee, Brehm, one firm‚Äôs New York attorneys, wrote county officials ‚Äúdeliberately taking away employee‚Äôs statutorily guaranteed right decide whether accept refuse administration covid-19 vaccines.‚Äù
The Feb. 2 letter arrived day another Wisconsin law firm. ‚ÄúIt firm belief ‚Ä¶ Rock County‚Äôs perhaps well-intentioned heavy-handed policy concerning mandatory vaccination county employees violates ‚Ä¶ constitutional rights,‚Äù wrote Michael J. Anderson MJA Law, located near Madison.
The following week, Brehm wrote behalf client, noting 15 additional employees represented separately Anderson. ‚ÄúWe hereby demand Rock withdraw covid-19 vaccine mandate forthwith since requiring unlicensed unapproved product violates federal law and, likely, numerous state laws,‚Äù wrote, time Siri also signing letter.
Anderson, local attorney, said spoke four six weeks ago representatives Siri &amp; Glimstad possibility working together. collaboration, said, would allow New York attorneys practice law Wisconsin temporary basis without formally admitted state bar.
‚ÄúThis New York firm ‚Äî believe interested cases like around country,‚Äù said interview. ‚ÄúGoing forward, litigation, may may involved. don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
In meantime, however, Anderson went ahead claim county earlier month, demanding $50,000 lost wages benefits 11 employees nursing home.
About week later, county showed signs backing down. health services committee voted 4-to-1 May 12 recommend officials revoke requirement nursing home reinstate employees refused shots. full county board consider recommendation Thursday. Well, May 1st CDC counting breakthrough cases involve hospitalization death. course numbers decreased. think assume much competence part. ;) sure provinces, Ontario wanted vaccinate every last old person finally (and extremely reluctantly) opening age brackets vaccination centres stood half-empty. ethics strange... CDC director got front Congress last year claimed masks effective vaccines. 

They also spent months months refusing admit COVID significant aerosol transmission. 

They also spent significant time giving stupid guidance fomites. 

The CDC done good job separating fact fiction. least includes already infected.  Bots force annoyance used distract piss poor response

If lab leak true China knew obvious many lives would've saved would've informed world. Trump closed travel to/from China anyone else, took ton shit still already late. think things play quite differently especially states like New York told 1-2 months prior. can‚Äôt make people better parents, way can‚Äôt make take vaccine. don‚Äôt mind orphaning kids, I? fuck would toddler blame this? Childhood amnesia real thing, it‚Äôs even clear gave parents COVID. Maybe mind business instead trying keep people didn‚Äôt ask help alive. Lori done atrocious job handling pretty much everything. JB. like Saint Andrew Albany, Sexual Predator killed Grandma lied (only rewarded book deal!), still telling great did. 7 day moving average, 7 day moving average 100.000 inhabitants.    Yes, therapy help. hard find right one. Please give yourself. deserve better. Yes, didn‚Äôt matter time used shift blame away US‚Äôs handling pandemic response towards China. It‚Äôs like someone getting stabbed saying first foremost figure stabbed them.

Now vaccines position pandemic winding down, it‚Äôs proper time root cause happened. You‚Äôre confusing per capita total numbers. Heck yeah! hand washing! Definitely going touch face, day. 

/s  Government knows best. Boris actually left Conservative party, hence manifesto 'spend, spend, spend' unlike predecessors 'cut deficit'. Also right leaning newspapers turned amount government spent covid schemes furlough scheme particular strict lockdown second wave, still strict nation majority vaccinated positive covid test rate 0.3%. Lol mean internal link found text one source posted? clearly see link back exact website, they're seperate sources... conclusions support want communicate--libertarianism. Partially disingenuous argument , whether fault design, currency media.

edit: IMHO  Frankly, looked like dismissed precisely previous administration suggesting say someone despised last administration.  Thank good answer. Thank asking! tell you‚Äôre good parent. Don‚Äôt force tell anything unless need know safety, health concerns. They‚Äôll honest feel like tell things terms. tell things, make sure take seriously let know appreciate honesty. Make sure know won‚Äôt get mad take say personally (but don‚Äôt let treat badly, disrespect another thing). last thing anyone would want talk admit something that‚Äôs really big dismissed. don‚Äôt mean hurt people‚Äôs feelings keep things myself, especially parents probably telling things.

If it‚Äôs really big deal I‚Äôve reluctant tell others, helps person tell it‚Äôs ok feel way stay confidential. want know won‚Äôt telling people (unless it‚Äôs health safety I‚Äôm ok it). want know wasn‚Äôt worrying nothing maybe it‚Äôs reassuring hear I‚Äôm worrying big deal. Support without condition whether approve goes long way, keeps real.

I admitted hospital asked parents leave ask questions. told honest wouldn‚Äôt get trouble stayed completely confidential unless safety safety around me. telling kinds things lol surprised myself. things wouldn‚Äôt told otherwise.

Just keep child‚Äôs well-being else situations leave behind criticism dismissal moment. Follow advice judgement necessary, based affected kid is, gentle.

This comment getting kind long, story dad gave kids piece paper could go paper wasn‚Äôt allowed get mad whatever said, meaning could honest didn‚Äôt afraid tell things things important parent know. really resonated me.

You‚Äôre great parent, thank asking. it‚Äôs relevant way, I‚Äôm 16 years old. talk initial studies looked protection vaccinated people. Also studying likely trial participants spread virus would added time complexity would slowed rollout. Now, months later, real world data showing helps prevent spread well.  ...

Framed legal overview offered benefit employers, schools organizations ‚Äúgrappling whether require Covid-19 vaccination,‚Äù piece warned ‚Äúcostly time-consuming litigation.‚Äù
Left unsaid fact Siri law partner representing Wisconsin nursing home employee objecting one requirement. piece also note significant disagreement law allows.
The fact sheet issued Food Drug Administration coronavirus vaccine recipients caregivers says ‚Äúyour choice receive receive‚Äù shots. language echoes provision federal law governing emergency authorization medicines stipulates people must informed ‚Äúof option accept refuse‚Äù product, also ‚Äúof consequences, any, refusing.‚Äù

Michelle M. Mello, professor law medicine Stanford University, said it‚Äôs clear whether statute meant address making shots compulsory work school.

An employer can‚Äôt hold get shots will, said experts health employment law, believe permissible consequence refusal vaccinate could, circumstances, losing job. December, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said employers requiring vaccine would comply federal disability law anti-discrimination statutes long make exceptions individual‚Äôs disability religious beliefs.
Still, employers avoided mandates. notable exceptions, including many universities, several hospitals Delta Air Lines, said month new employees must vaccinated.
Many police officers spurn coronavirus vaccines departments hold mandates
Employers confidence requiring vaccination, experts said, products gain FDA‚Äôs full approval, U.S. pharmaceutical firm Pfizer German partner, BioNTech, seeking coronavirus vaccine. decision regulators could come soon fall, coronavirus vaccine makers expected apply full approval soon.   reason would bucket hot buttered popcorn. sure draw is. exactly pills lol, drug take cope life problems? people antidepressants group right?
