Sticking principles important solving one individual issue.

I'm saying COVID restrictions unjustified, giving government much power could dangerous. Another Trump situation government controlled single party (vs. current democratic house) could literally see end democracy. 15+ family members got it. completely fine.  haha, yeah... that's one abbreviations better trying pronounce dragon I’ve chasing 35 years. It’s aligned caring arts general. There’s depressingly lot care especially given (in social circles) people arts far willing follow restrictions voluntarily often anyway. defend possible reopen extent safely. New York went summer low cases. likely thats going case places. Rolling reopenings vaccines become available. Badass grandma. mean, yes. Illinois worst rates infection country one point.

I want get dick measuring contest state wave disastrous (and I'm sure states bad we're currently seeing California based stories), really, really bad. really, really bad couple months California was. think another article 2 billion again, kid glove treatment police. Explaining stuff them?...just fucking arrest disorderly conduct. 

The police useless corrupt. think /u/gaukonigshofen pointing one obvious reasons leading charge COVID spread. POTUS anti-masker, minions follow suit.  California much stricter rules Florida 51,000 new cases 679 deaths Friday. talking Florida? numbers identical Cali force lockdowns masks? actually comparing situation Jim Crow? Good fucking god, get life. Every Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, Walgreens, etc give flu shot. ok people vaccinated go concerts &amp; music festivals? Seems like need type proof vaccination carry phone . Worked st comedy club covid. closed, places still open cannot exist fall best case opening. need actually care industries hurt covid

I worked city gets extremely cold quickly make vast majority money spring summer. especially summer people “let loose” brutal winter

I hate diologue around industries perceived large enough voting blocs  total war? find trial information per country unfortunately  weren’t Dodger stadium nightmare heavy traffic.  proof lol Jesus man, get entitlement checked. Dude, many people american. wife kids get flu shot. gotten flu shots 10yrs. never get sick. three hand gets sick every year. saying Nobody said anything kind. donate literally everyone, Democrat Republican. donated fucking McSally Sinema. I'm sorry, poor Gorillas :( now. Obviously eventually kids get studies done. Full circle back Harambe. curse broken. People would remotely tolerate 4 month lockdown similar March. really. obliterate way businesses one imagine. don’t get people don’t see boarded places around town There’s place hometown called Delias Tamales, brought woman named Delia great business great food. opening restaurant San Antonio, hope people able taste great dish soon. People wait literally hours sometimes get tamales! Here’s clip interview recent I'm chronic reddit account nuker.

Doing fine someone decides NEED pick fight dumb misunderstanding comments. get way worked reddit anyone ever should, nuke account claim I'm done commenting. I'm back new account month lol. Dude can't take HAND made food people pandemic NHL board crossing fingers canceled. Remindme! 180 days go back month ago buy doses ones work. SARS-CoV-2 productively infects Syrian hamsters, rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, cats, dogs laboratory experiments.

Natural infection SARS-CoV-2 also documented ferrets, mink, dogs, small large cats. makes potentially viable animal models, apart large cats typically used biomedical research.

Among species, natural transmission observed mink, cats, Yes, agree.  I’m little confused, would FDA give EUA data South African trials wait still US data? Wow. potentially big one based manufacture, easiness distribute one dose. country live (NL) use mainly one vaccinate young healthy population. Pfizer healthcare professionals Moderna elderly. someone get flu vaccine flu practically disappeared year? Instant pot steamer setting ya got Right give high risk people earlier Well, starts Trump states yes, administrations response large part blame failure, failures way every level government would unfair lay responsibility him. 

It's failures incompetence, way down.  trajectory downright scary, among least affected European countries month That's enough 200 million people. US population 328 million. enough herd immunity even vanilla coronavirus, let alone mutant strains. I’ve sacrificed make sure people don’t die get hurt em masse, didn’t sacrifice get back normality sooner   Exactly. catastrophic scenario always breakdown hospitals. that's longer threat vulnerable vaccinated, enter back territory ruining livelihoods creating poverty dangerous virus. That’s 50lbs freedom units. god that’s lot flour. get info re: tamales? matter companies listen this! I'm sure amazing troll picked worst possible band example going pay workers? going deny living?  doubt. That’s said total failure leadership levels :) 

It’s actually incredible badly fucked up. Like middle school pre algebra school student could’ve figured ... 

“If X # people vaccinated, every person giving shot administer # shots per day, many people need giving shots vaccinate everyone 3 months?”

Like seems like point anyone actually figure needed mass inoculation centers logistics set ahead time actually get done quickly. states ever large disastrous wave like California experiencing right now? Remindme! 6 months several. ask prescribed studied more, cause know. put hcq ringer decided even try anymore. I'm fat wear glasses. absolutely hate wearing masks. options go see favorite band mask go I'm gonna shit eating grin right behind mask Well yeah probably Africa poor countries lack access vaccines, rich countries will, world whole That’s like bonus every week working there! 80% hospitalizations fatalities 12-15% population, people aged 65+ health conditions. protected fatality risk drops 80% entire crisis far less crisis. Health care workers higher risk getting also spreading it. Pretty simple. whose lives worth less others. focusing people risk and/or spreading it. don’t agree one could predicted wave. People warning weeks Christmas. mean agree well. That’s good reason feel Last two years first time adult life them. I'm almost 40. Ya, lot Americans also realize many people countries travel U.S. healthcare system countries' free, lacks quality. biggest drawback universal free healthcare. Doctors selfish people follow money get paid practice Anybody acknowledge politically ignorant. abundantly obvious anyone pays ounce attention news Trump admin's rollout plan vaccines less stellar. Exactly that. can’t something solely based young healthy respecting restrictions don’t really think it’s acceptable reward st risk people punish people cannot get vaccinated yet. age groups open think that’s different high all. continue isolate they've vaccinated? whole point start opening things back up, getting people back work, getting deaths getting back normal life. [Yeah Countries can, end, choose purchase fewer vaccines — Germany's approach snap leftovers seems catching on. France, too, already begun purchase leftover doses, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, delegate minister charge industry, said Thursday. Denmark also this.

Bulgaria secured 500,000 doses, two million fewer could purchased. realize US still second largest manufacturer goods right? manufacturing happens cities, plus headquarters agribusinesses located cities well. girlfriend, except since early December never tested positive. directly exposure (she's teacher). second time lost sense taste smell. last 4 months. don’t support intermingling though. I’m saying don’t open one group rarely feel lonely. especially true pre-pandemic, true even now. I've always loner. People kind get nerves.

But social isolation still wearing down. Every social interaction (whether phone person) leaves feeling anxious wracked intense self-loathing feelings. 

When variety social interactions every day, feel like this. ignore less-than-perfect social performances focus good ones.

Even times like this. right delayed right denied. Communism dead end. failed ideology one wants it.

I assume that's suggesting bring collectivism? forms collectivism that're economically socially viable sure, communism one them. India already reached herd immunity numbers falling since months. imagine also happen countries, hell anywhere really locked down? Even devil standards. They'll end emptiness void. hard lockdown didnt work country.


So extending it... Fair enough. That's big rabbit hole go though. could also add % chance kill/main someone permanently. Herd immunity works weaker individuals everyone gets vaccinated(or infected). 

I really care people's personal decisions body part. decisions affect others(99.9999% people denying vaccine isolate bet) rubs wrong way. Nope. dhouldn't feel guilt starting great normla life ater pandemic. generally feel ashamed happy. yor life preety much impact happens people Here? yeah testing free easy find government sites. want rapid test 150 private clinic. Even surge turn around time 2 days max. got money test everyone around somewhat safe. people raw dogging though. that's sad hear. hopefully vaccine, year years come better know never disappear sadly. whole investigation big cacophony given PRCinfluence head. Ok. scary mrna vaccine? actually provide reason besides “I don’t know science I’m skeptical it”

And yes. agree shouldn’t mandatory. doesn’t absolve people consequences actions TIL people live North Dakota ""China’s government strictly controlled research home origins virus, an Associated Press investigation found, state-owned media played fringe theories suggest virus could originated elsewhere.
The AP investigation found China’s government handing hundreds thousands dollars grants scientists researching virus’ origins southern China. monitoring findings mandating publication data research must approved new task force managed China’s Cabinet, direct orders President Xi Jinping, according internal documents obtained AP.
The culture secrecy believed delayed warnings pandemic, blocked sharing information hampered early testing. Australia countries called investigation origins virus, prompting angry responses Beijing.""  Testing understand free, though. could wrong that's cousins told me. Japan, Socialist Party also taken power past. CDP likes China, center. political problem Japan opposition fond foreign countries (China, Russia, N. Korea, S. Korea). Therefore, many Japanese choose LDP. But, Japan's LDP neoliberal, perspective average Japanese, LDP leftist believes globalism. We're also 100 years scientifically advanced medically educated. we're living 100% potential, massive factor. think part problem socialite nature LA. I’ll honest, still lived would harder resist going out. Japan reacted lazily growing pandemic Kanto hospitals starting fall apart, government continues lazy.

Considering Moderna looking approved til May....ugh. good bad points, people still vaccinated immune systems primed further.

The problem that, people it:

1. We're presumably under-testing 4:1 overall;
2. need deal long-term consequences millions, tens millions patients;
3. many people it, still spreading, *possible* (and means certain) reproductive rate even higher thought, and/or prior infection offers less protection assumed (but absolutely **not** proven could outweighed extent lockdown compliance). lest forget blocking investigation team going find source ONE YEAR after. Fighting health orders suppressed really treated like every business, ""fighting good fight"". makes plague rat . . . bad Christian. argument made every worker matter life death, though.

Not fair assume every week worked since assume contract Half-arse effective; effective. get transmission somewhere region 3-5 old/new variants, 1-1.5 lockdown, that's effective. might enough spare us severe consequences make difference many people treated time buy us time roll vaccine. course, more, would get results might right call, mistake 2/3 effective still growing completely ineffective.

Incidentally, going hard lockdown *would* going home case. yo virus real Collectivism way forward. gov confident, I'm not. not. problem government corporations shady people trust them

You _have_ trust them. complete cynic still see reason lie mislead here.

Think cynical way POV - government's corporations' best interests? Even give fuck people all, government corps reasons want vaccine work properly, without side effects.

They want ECONOMY back. economy ain't coming back unless vast majority population gets back there, working buying paying taxes. population ain't getting working shopping paying taxes unless safely. vaccine _caused_ health problems would completely counter getting economy back online. don’t care look one, even find one wouldn’t relevant. mRNA vaccines new enough point can’t know long term effects. Doesn’t mean people shouldn’t get it, everyone’s personal choice. guys see Vietnam war museum Ho Chi Minh. There's different perspective war see museums US.

Every country writes history relates them. surprising China focuses achievements rather mistakes. They’re private business whatever want! Like Twitter !! It’s fair prolong pandemic based fears zero historical biological basis. Good, glad control somewhere... hope 4000 mutations recorded Corona19 sequence, 2 actalually distinct transmission numbers, real changes appear virus.... 

This could potentially allow us pass Covid19 covid 20/21 strains Corona flues spread virus changes form variant immune slightly affected vaccines, still valid unmentioned possibility. would require efforts possibly casualties again. also 3 day holiday, probably going get real bad Wednesday's numbers. no, that's something happens later way defending beliefs; original problem People keep entertaining deep lot people selfish irrational phobia science stuff involves them. validate people themself area vax degree

You call skeptical really think somehow know trained professionals would Covid related deaths yes. people died quicker didn’t spend 4-8 weeks hospital would coped pressures lot better unnecessary deaths would prevented.

The point making death toll isn’t thing think about.  really. It’s new vaccine media fear mongering exposed conspiratorially prone people are. It’s similar USA government developed vaccine Lol. 2023/24? Typical Reddit. 

They let unvaccinated. athletes poor countries get vaccinated. They've brainwashed since kids friend, point arguing No. It’s problem people thinking smarter know something stuff don’t It’s still SARS COV2 hope wins probably afford test often.

Read little something exponential growth. go far start punishing bad thing happens regardless reasonableness response limits power prevent it, sets incentives try burry bad situation instead dealing it.

I think right. standard punish/reward local officials dealing crisis transparent clear. metric basing ""more seriously"" on?

Because much right thinks conspiracy ""take freedom"" ""just flu"", taking ""more seriously right"" count much.

Which think problem. Liberals actually believe COVID exists, they're willing make minor sacrifices lifestyle changes regard situation affects individuals, something prioritize most. like article tries account non-death economic impacts well. use estimated monetary values controlling asthma measure dealing symptoms require hospitalization, values controlling chronic bronchitis measure symptoms require hospitalization result death.

Given we've learning long-term effects people getting COVID, suspect we're going see economic impacts time. last year. Oh triumphed alright exhibition displays PRC authorities deleted/burned/removed research experimental papers associated Corona Virus Wuhan virology institute? trace bat Carrier related research, source almost 30 peer reviewed papers. gone.... Well done China. This. Back April Cuomo hailed hero loled hard. mean, compare Cuomo, even mayor Wuhan done better job, yet almost 1.5 Billion Chinese want head pole. get flu shot office, I've worked home almost year. I’ve always 100% pro vaccine kids. reason, bit pause one. know long-term effects one long-term? feels rushed, back mind, thought arises maybe compromises made aren’t bad COVID wrecking havoc population.

I know perspective coming ignorance (I haven’t read much vaccines), hopefully explains “the side” bit.

I’ll still getting vaccine available me, I’ll probably reading day comes self-assurance. maybe aint place im hoping put work changing done, dog. Bc people go home vacation Florida test positive home state. live Key West know 8 tourists tested positive week-ish visiting later died covid complications. 

I live party town. Normally husband go dinner, drinks live music 2-4 nights week. bar since March 16 dined anywhere home. Instacart groceries, week hubs goes right grocery store opens get random stuff instacart good for. people friends similar. know people still dining going bars, petrified tourists ignoring covid protocols. bad pastor go vacation south. Every Canadian would asking head. 

Instead creates potential super spreader events regular basis Canada simply asks stop. 

What fuck wrong people country? priorities fucked up. traveling might smartest decision actually getting angry people feeling need interfere cringe. Mind business, let people live life, let suffer consequences. virus spread whether friend goes vacation not. 

Cut people slack, we’re exhausted. You’re covid police chill tf out. city's party secretary (in China, party secretary powerful mayor)has fired.

Is fired acting late? playing down? ""bad things happen prefecture must go""? Japan wants delay make better tournament arc. 2 weeks also japan life barely changed here.

you think might something huh? Pfizer phase 3 data shows almost complete protection 10 days first dose (it's amazing graph behold)... that's protection Covid symptoms, protection hospitalization much higher. Plus it’s dipped 0 like twice winter? delay it. hard. meet Please, continue assume know me.

I remember anything discredited either. dismissed. will.

In 9 days, 11 hours, 13 minutes. lol  kid drive thru testing one end, drive thru vaccination other. Last year late. example, Wuhan lock-down two days Chinese new year. time everybody already hometown. government could shut cinemas ask people go celebrating streets. Well that’s one way get close god quickly possible. Good job! religious people like you. world would truly better place. That's wrong lol Yep lived 20 years
i forgot add “slack jawed” “get gun”
and youre right “playing” actually real. aware unlike careerfield military nurses doctors either get training civilian institutions civilian bodies complete oversight military programs.

True, military invited in, even doctors working FEMA. Here's graphs Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin Colorado. Trend lines same. Smooth arch. Period viral seeding exponential growth hit lag coming down. certainly agree trend lines - that's point. trend lines despite differences changes mobility.

Again, idea look conclude concluding. 18% decrease mobility baseline sufficient trigger collapse cases we've seen North Dakota (80% decrease 6 weeks), states graph greater 18% decreases mobility summer/fall see massive spikes? foot. 18% change mobility sufficient reduce R0 far enough 1 trigger kinds reductions, state averaged 25% reduction mobility summer never seen surge.

It looks like simply conflating correlation causation. Obviously people reduce mobility cases increase.  Depends underlying health issues. waiting thousands lock way late.

Every sane mind know happened Wuhan. Unfortunately lot people get it. sure did. really debate. I's like opinion, man. get vaccine, need front line?  Thanks. 

Honestly met guy year ago, I’m real broken up, wife pretty upset.

I’m pretty much “what be, be” whole stupid lot families. They’re behaving irrationally. Sources? Well husband 10 years old you, onto something. Mental health good right nope feel good sitting sweats working stupid home desk. Give leniency. Nothing normal right now. sounds like live together? hard spend 24/7 around ANYONE. Talk maybe plan time 'get ready' takeout something, date. feel bad. CCP highly concerned economy well. smart enough realize

Well, part reason CCP focus less Economy. last five years, party narrative campaign economy slow focus improving ordinary people's life quality instead. Chinese people receptive idea economy might good la-la days.   Australia New Zealand accounts isolated least densely populated places earth minimal travel small populations. article, he’s adding churches Publix list distribution sites. anything, gets credit picking two groups handled pandemic abysmally. going do, swap communion vaccine dose? Truly pathetic. “get jab”? Goddamnit  say economic cost losing life someone past retirement age losing life someone 30s

That's said. (Speaking forcing data fit narrative....) said necessarily ""drain"" economy.

As relatives gotten older I've become involved different hobbies, I've hanging around lot people 65+ age group paying attention them. real eye-opener see many still worked (even part-time) much spent hobbies. example, started going birding field trips, help notice people who'd spent thousands dollars spotting scopes long-distance birding trips tended retired. Also found surprising number old people ski weekdays; took lessons ladies 70s.

While people engaging much economic activity somebody works full-time, they're way sitting home collecting Social Security. yep first winter/spring surge dextramethosone , proning, anticoagulants right?  Uh, yeah are. remember correctly WV also last state get official case COVID Im sorry absurd. I've seen many times sub little depressing now. 

It 'BS'.. data right peer-reviewed p3 trial. public accessible. first dose pfizer confers ~90% protection measured using like-for-like efficacy metric. primary reason second dose prime boost regimen generating durable, longer lasting immunity. important first dose always heavy lifting. 

You probably heard story 52% protection right? stems mainstream media understand primary efficacy endpoint calculated go communicate concretely public.  pfizer final efficacy number found 95% that's calculated looking PCR confirmed symptomatic cases anytime 7 days dose 2. infection occured past 28 days point dose 1 ignored. 

Whereas 52% number counts every infection point dose 1. data cumulative incidence antibody titre clearly shows vaccine kick till 12 days. deviate placebo. 
That's 52% figure sounds artificiailly low 95% artificiailly high, they're measured separate metrics infections occur first date. 

The data right Moderna too. See trial. See FDA briefing. data shows ~92% one dose.

That's one reason various governments gone decision give second dose 21 days apart (21 days, way chosen minimum time pfizer could use trial given urgency time constraints optimal dose interval) works ok
CDC/AICP usually set 4 week delay minimum vaccine US 
 places going tweak it. countries pressing issues supply constraints rising cases. 

Also everyone pfizer trial even got second dose within 21 day planned window.. got (not design) six weeks later.. that's denmark, says six week delay fine. They've seen raw data. Everyone’s moms vacation there. That’s problem see logic it, focusing first productive age demographics.

It far plausible logic:  vaccines' third phase trial didn’t include young children elders. Texas? everyone going party- catching it- bringing home state read toss wash One month later.. Well, offering you. Apparently always you. narcissistic one. outdoor activities would go it. cold outdoor stuff summer. hear though, im 30, husband 32 know elderly people cancer fine covid. know tons people fine, makes think! lot goals life want work towards them. think make outdoor plans friends want. happening Native American tribes really depressing. population Navajo Nation 173,667 (from Google) 871 deaths would mean 1 200 0.5% people Navajo Nation died due Covid, almost five times USA’s death rate 1 1,000 0.1%.  condemn building health code violations. reliable study lot reasons:

* looked hospitalized patients 
* half discharged patients refused participate (so really random sample)
* control group mentioned. idea common (minor) problems reporting general population. covid-19 hotspot Hubei province surrounds Beijing

you mistook Hubei province Hebei. Hubei province Wuhan capital. year ago scared shitless thought COVID 3% chance killing us. learned kids people 60 really much risk dying. Suddenly scary many people life line.

Give us similar disease even 1% kids healthy younger adults die people scared leave homes could stop USA (Not sure Canada). could simply say ""If deliberately violate health orders place, Health Insurance companies refuse payment Covid related treatment."" Now, they'll still treated people like credit scores like $75k bills hung around necks think twice attending promoting bullshit. can’t appeal intelligence healthcare workers making decision experts disagree whole heartedly. now, vaccinating little month. 

We vaccinating since July. Surely, means people get vaccine 5 months sooner right? Yes, housebound people can’t leave house usually means aren’t mobile. said first description that’s talking about. think meant generally 18.5% entire population. 18.5% tests run. really bad this.

Obviously going exactly 18.5% entire population. rough estimate. obviously going direction correlation percent population positive positivity rate though. true percentage people positive going bit number people given day taking multiple tests going slim. helping argument. again, 10% serology testing working entire herd immunity BS.

I'm talking taking multiple tests given day. I'm talking people taking multiple tests mid-August now.

Not really sure arguing point. I'm biologist. Idk we're anywhere near herd immunity whatever. see far-fetched near 50% ND infected looking graph showed me.

Let ask this: day 18.5% COVID tests positive (7-day average), percentage population would estimate currently COVID? go. Can't stay topic. Definitely bright. Border N.K. : check. worries. fat kid shoot anything moves 10 miles away border. 

Border Vietnam: check. tight sealed, Vietnam even fewer COVID patients China has. 

Border Mongolia: icy cold. case, assume border tightly controlled. 

Border India: Tens thousands soldiers side standing Himalayas. worry something border, surely COVID. 

Border Russia: that's real deal. border long, under-manned, major source imported COVID back summer. However, winter now, temperature around -30 -40 C. ok now. 

International airlines major concern China prevent people coming virus. Well, done this, also according China. Apparently things change time. bad stupid can't get it. can’t read clearly says Queen **and** Prince Philip? Maybe time eye test.  cremation becoming popular/accepted UK? can’t read clearly says Queen **and** Prince Philip? Maybe time eye test. Quick google search tells free drive-thru testing sites free, mail-in saliva testing you’re showing symptoms. personally MA, free testing sites pretty widely available. course, onus still individual seek out/schedule testing.  Yeah, doubt. like saying eating shit worse drinking piss. Maybe either. Current life long North Dakota resident, winter absolutely run September May believe true people stay even brutal stretches. Hooorayyy holidays! Butts seats = money. Simple equation. [Yes has. We're hitting Lombardy levels death back spring.

Except little obedience enforcement social distancing guidelines. car dealerships count transportation??? Haha sure see allowed go group? Pedantic hat on: England island.

The South England particular size Latvia population equal Venezuela. 

Pedantic hat off: Without proper, strict lockdown going even serious trouble. hate word “chemicals” means much many ignorant people. It’s much universal word actually means nothing. You’re fucking idiot. think we’re done here. April may better estimate prob. say that, slow delay presume? could ended sentence 3 words earlier. Try Guys posted interview Dr Fauci.  interview done layman’s terms public.  
Takeaway need 70%-85% herd immunity.  (As right NYC low 20s.). 
If get herd immunity levels could open big issues late summer/ early fall. Peer reviewed doesn’t mean correct. states getting hammered surges right lot people ones bad month two ago, contributes it. holiday travel definitely part it.

we also massively scaled rollout rapid testing we're week two January, lot school districts workplaces using surveillance testing probably picking cases. worries covid annoying us don’t blame it’s stressful af I'm currently hosting refugee friend mine Australia work there. want nonsense states delusional. Owned Postmedia currently 66% owned American media conglomerate (Chatham Asset Management), known close ties Republican Party (United can’t believe weeks ago hoping get vaccinated March 😭 rate probably June later line hate “my mental health important.” mental health important, doubt doctor recommending go 400 person rave opposed maybe exercising park yoga something sorts.

In words actually happening. ""Do whatever want"" States America  24/7 way go. Yay! mean weren’t awful spring that’s sure

So agree facts regarding Europe least. point arguing assumption climate played significant role success (and likewise Europe’s failure) doesn’t really make sense.

I never made assumption, never claimed climate played significant role them. asked anyone could know didn't? 

My entire point post many variables goes success failure country impossible say sure country X succeeded reason Y. leads situation everyone interprets data confirm beliefs already hold.

I know Vietnam's climate played significant role success. many others seem strong belief didn't. know this? naively asked question weeks ago. reality already fighting pandemic whether VA hospitals already civilian hospitals. anyone know US suddenly much worse rest world? mean, yea lot us behave badly, travel much wear mask, etc. numbers charts. periodically check countries like India Brazil also high numbers before. Obviously want high numbers, I'm confused much worse here. new strain place? people traveling Thanksgiving? Jesus, man... “Mild virus”. 

If 350k+ deaths mild... would consider serious? /r/lostredditors especially true many Frontline workers nursing home residents gotten first vaccine. Let's go. know matter comes soothing someone's fears.

Opening gyms lead additional deaths. I've explained why. deaths could family, too. Sometimes rights conflict, right killed far outweighs right go gym months. Lol wtf idea CRISPR mRNA vaccines developed based technology I'm hospital lot pretty terrifying many ignorant nurses running around. Dr. Gupta wrote article reducing hospital infections one hospital, lot nurses believed rumor hand sanitizer caused abortions. pretty much auto mod now. start deleting anything mentions political name Athletes poorer countries haven’t stopped training either. I’m 100% positive either taking COVID risk adapted training continue training Olympics. think bothered, ever...other promising going magically disappear using opportunity grift. optometrist thinks COVID hoax. Haha true. Sorry. India already 50 million Oxford vaccines stockpiled. vaccinate 300 million people first three months. quebec PD needs least 20k strong effectively enforce this. Food thought. great example difference statistical significance clinical significance. results show RR 1.1 (CI 1.0-1.2) p ~= 0.02. Maybe there's something there, maybe isn't, pretty clearly indicates going silver bullet (consistent literature).

It's also bit hard draw conclusions set patient populations good outcomes infection. 93.1% placebo group survived, compared 100% treatment group. Again, that's nothing, that's high survival rate, making generalizability difficult.  think that's good news herd immunity. Slaoui plans distributed enough doses vaccinate hundred million people March 1, combined estimate infected could realistically talking super majority population immunized sometime March.  Dude it’s really like mentally weak freak this. Please like seriously seriously ask something worth arguing over. yes false positives issue whole pandemic haha :p one thing NY leading deaths last 10 months. another thing get massively hit beginning spend 8 months one lowest percentages spread.

A place like Florida Texas can't double triple NY deaths months claim they've done anything great. Thank you, totally agree reminder, medical advice, period. give someone medical advice kind, comment removed, may banned.

If even hint ways obtain prescription medication without legal valid prescription qualified licensed medical professional, permanently banned. Murdoch newspaper, like Sun UK? Guess understand then.

And re: husband probably got 2 false positives

Someone get lottery ticket.  Fining antimaskers good enough.

Jail time assets seizure would start. Maybe put fly lists fact virus make lives worse well.
 
Couldn't bothered wear mask public? vacations next 10 years. think CDC's 91 million Americans it? I'm sure lot cases know of, 91 million seems like insane amount. given immediately infection could theoritically help people longer incubation periods, known vaccine help people already symptom onset. It’s really interesting months leading vaccine, pundits saying poorly vaccination rural areas go due storage/transportation logistics. Looks like states best vaccination rates fact rural ones Nice see state government getting done. Enough privatization everything. absolutely nothing CRISPR. CRISPR genome editing technology changed DNA.

these vaccines use mRNA coated lipid signal ribosomes produce proteins. absolutely affect DNA whatsoever.

CRISPR mRNA vaccines completely unrelated. kind ignorance conflation gene therapy DNA editing part what's causing people paranoid. What’s common sense here? non compliance

Can use terminology? Taking vaccine ""compliance"". Like wearing masks? fauci never learned Measles barely mutates vaccines guarantee sterilizing immunity incredibly high efficacy.


Thats say vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. Right lot guessing game  Miracle cure. Take one already approved pill die COVID.

There's clinical evidence supporting even clear mechanism action. “The city's R-value 1.02, meaning person contracts COVID-19 infect one person. “

That’s means empty desert get much covid cases idk /s Somebody please help us get smarter. ""Trust takes decades build, moment break, lifetime rebuild.""

Flemish proverb: ""Trust comes foot leaves horseback"" Manaus citizen here. Let explain disastrous Covid-19 spreading here.

Since death cases exact (many covid-19 deaths classified ""unspecified SARS"" due delay covid exam results death) use dark precise measurement: burials

In normal situation approximately 30 burials daily city. Since Jan 6th burying 100 people daily. Sunday (Jan 10th) cemeteries buried 144 people. largest number daily burials pandemic (maybe city history), surpassing even 1st wave peaks April/May.

Hospitals crowded. public particular health care. particular hospitals stopped attend new patients 24h rooms take care them. never see anything like life. like we're war.

Don't believe herd immunity bullshit. Stay safe stay home possible. That's fine agree argument OK people use personal risk tolerance vaccine last 8-10 months called people refuse wear masks shut business. business owners anti-maskers ""right weigh risk death?""

How getting vaccine different wearing mask? if, getting vaccine presented option, get asymptomatic case proceed spread people die? Disunited States America. total number people infected bound peak positivity rate though. 

For sake simplicity, say 20% (150k) North Dakotans test positive one day 20% also test positive 2 weeks later. That's 40% population infected. Given positivity rate peaked 16.03% wave, need tested 1.5 million unique individuals wave 

Why would unique individuals? People tested positive past might want get tested see they're negative; people may get tested regularly work, etc. I’d like secede then, form bleu etat allianz name christ /s  I’m NH, made joke Something something speakeasies illicit ""after hours"" parties make decision example anti-vaxxers science deniers. Hopefully realize average police department needs 4-5 times larger comes major cities. can't properly enforce 4.6k cops entire city. (and family) rights too. Nice know matter comes soothing someone's fears. nurse. West Virginia wiping floor New York despite much lower income tax. pretty easy understand lot Americans suspicious notion raising taxes improves quality life. Oh completely agree, stating Japanese government actively made sure keep them. **However, significantly higher proportion patients discharged alive hospital received ivermectin.**   

This matters Give source life expectancy 2020, link goes 2018. even 2019's yet, saying 2020's higher... Glad getting better, sounds like huge immune response. I'm surprised one major adverse events listed occurring reported via VAERS. Hope better soon. Oh, gosh. need adult education system. Thank sharing quote! rights end start infringing rights others, sorry. get human sacrifices order look ripped. think Americans accept ""one best world."" national sentiment want best world, better best world, full stop. state, Massachusetts, given doses 2.2% population, would higher country besides Israel, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States itself. That's good enough me. want governor, Charlie Baker, drastically expand vaccine pool get doses arms, want learn lessons anywhere world that's better us, including states within borders.

One fastest goal. example, consider excusable aren't. Obviously bigger issue Oklahoma right pope involved election steal prophets saying united states prepared blackout's. per mother law. 


Like literal fuck wrong people. studies see could reduce symptoms. vaccines like MMR vaccine help symptoms given infection soon enough Average monthly wages places like Serbia 300eu/mo, yes, $15 big deal. Definitely downplaying see guys? politicians scared people couple zip ties trouble. really think health care workers refusing take vaccine holding process. New York example, Cuomo refers hospital's ""refusal limit"" reached vaccine sent another facility. means facility given every worker wants it, move on.

If look carefully reports unused discarded vaccines doses like last 3 5 doses end vial something. media would love turn big story states ramping tens thousands vaccinations day really think sitting waiting. That’s considered too. It’s amazing talking people like you. hell? country, churches still open operating like nothing happening hospitals collapsing. That's confusing me. vaccines work medicines treatment?

We drugs even AIDS now. virologist could made simple mistake working monomeric ACE2 rather correct dimeric ACE2. monomeric ACE2 low binding general since hACE2 dimerized receptor vivo. I’m wondering MLB delay spring training &amp; start season article literally says PA responsible health care vaccination West Bank. Look, makes sense. Palestinians wouldn’t happy Israel responsible health care public health normally, completely understandable. also means can’t demand Israel sudden abandon goal hard work vaccinating entire population suddenly start offering vaccines Palestinians. 

Whatever Israel does, always get criticised someone. think applaud govt set efficient vaccination roll sharing data countries learn it. Palestinians incompetent govt blame decades mismanagement. isn’t Israel. many died there? leadership above...the states basically told hospitals figure out.


No, think I'm making excuse anyone, unless think states leadership position think providing little direction actual hospitals/pharmacies etc somehow excusable, personally, don't. people really get Independent agencies federal level work.

Show us evidence claim there. 90% efficacy second dose halved. disease thinking 3/4 patients given positive prognosis yet suffer disabling symptoms six months onset? 1313 hospitalized week ending Saturday 3.7%   

I doubt there's tracking mild &amp; asymptomatic. think hospitalized say mild case. Yep exactly right. world broken two groups -- terribly afraid Covid sure ever get better, ""hoaxers"". try suggest good news analysis ""one them"". dead!* 🔔  people know

Yep tragic stories emergency health care worker breaking point, can't take more, dead bodies piling hallways... yet significant % health care workers refuse take vaccine. Sounds like found disgruntled health care worker wanted vent made headline it. hate take single passage claim directs behave today. Roman empire different place today, consequences following Roman laws pretty horrific.

On hand, absolutely theological scientific excuse defying government orders limiting spread Covid. behaviour inexcusable. Age based. Everyone knows thier age, big risk factor, easy verify, easy adjust number eligible people supply changes. actually believe Satan trying force go. know people honestly believe faith tested, way remain faithful Christians keep going packed church services. care pray home, churches services online now. worship God Jesus. worship going church.  nicknamed North Texas reason Put jail! mean, CCP usually does? especially questionable? evidence this, already know that. remember reading virologist AMA used SARS-CoV-2 LOW affinity ACE2 prove wasn’t lab made. always confused me. Virology super confusing. Exactly thought read this. Yep feeds itself, everyone one side issue. Nobody discusses good news, progress, calm, facts. Everyone tries out-doom other.

There headline 14 year old died virus leads people believe young old affected equally teens great risk. know many Covid fatalities US people age 0-14? 105, 313,000 total deaths. Statistically 5 people aged 0-14 die *per day* swimming pool accidents.

Do people know 95% people die Covid least one (often many) health conditions average age 80 80% fatalities 65+? say people matter anything like that. fatalities heavily concentrated elderly sick. guess reasoning extra jabs come later year, Oxford vaccine supposedly already approved - get cheap one instead, even efficiency bit lower. guess Oh, youmean group told world limit travel would limit information flow? ones clearly heavily influenced China? full year manufacture whatever explanation wanted?

Trust them, guys! They're real serious trustworthy. temporary law ""real"" one hopefully books quickly election 2022. sure. Also, NBA opportunity sit back watch MLB NFL test cases them. think MLB NFL player, coach, employee died CV19 things would different. far know 1 player even missed significant time outside mandatory 14-day isolation period, Ryquell Armstead contracted season even started. He's long-hauler, appears. March still full arena fans. Almost teams playing fans hospital's oxygen supply ""reached critical situation"" due rising numbers Covid-19 infections.** *A document shared BBC showed Southend Hospital reduce amount uses treat patients. said target range oxygen levels patients' blood cut 92% baseline 88-92%.

This happened 1st wave too, would thought would learnt lesson.

April 17, 2020: [NHS rationing oxygen doctors instructed downgrade blood saturation hope - [seems probably explains roll slow  mean [this Haidt rejects rational thinking entirely. Indeed, goes far label engage systematic rational thinking ""autistic"" (pg 136). labels modern, civilized countries WEIRD (an insulting acronym made up). also interest individual rights, America's Bill Rights. Rather, finds solace ignorance impoverished villagers northeast Brazil primitive people India wipe butts hands (really! see pg 122). praises studies show ignorant people prefer collectivism use intuitions (prejudices/biases) making moral decisions. Critical thinking? Rights? Haidt, they're irrelevant. He's openly hostile critical thinking. disparages psychological studies advanced (""WEIRD"") countries ""statistical outliers"" (pg 112). Lemme guess: island nation. Ask jack     guess prioritizing seniors without segmentation, state filled seniors job plenty free time, enough vaccine, good idea all.  reliable study

Reliability speaks study's repeatability: every time turn knob, open door might say study reliable.

*Validity* seems issue study: want see people suffering long-term effects COVID19 things I'm using criteria good job measuring COVID19 damage?

This RCT. reads like case studies and, given first study kind magnitude, exploratory research. concerns raising would properly addressed follow-up studies testing hypotheses developed early observational studies. seems massively overblown imo. NY best administering doses, better terms population vaccinated.

Cuomo's anti line-jumping stance made clinic committed fraud get bunch doses distribute random.

Also...NY expanding groups get vaccine today.

I think people like Cuomo's rhetoric, NY really much different compared states. sufficient time mr. Chlorox friend Mr. Clean act. Well said. wonder though, possible reinfected get sick therefor spread unknowingly. Many people go back relaxed way living they’ve sick virus would never even think getting tested since they’ve already virus don’t symptoms. Yes that's china routinely causes people disappear. journalist disappeared investigating coronavirus cover-up Wuhan reappeared 2 months later, praising police detained would feel large events required proof vaccine purchase tickets? (Sporting events, concerts, etc)

Do think possibility?

If got us back normal life faster actually think might okay this. Also, wasn’t law passed breaking? so, violating *LAWS*, rules.  tier system working. Open vaccine citizens imo. Yep see over.

One article high case fatality rates become. Read article find they're talking hospitalized patients, general population. mention headline.

Another headline said Japan's ""Medical care system already state collapse"". Read bottom article opinion given associate professor, sounds like referring difficulty giving examinations, entire country's medical system.

Many articles talking ""heart damage"" caused Covid athletes. myocarditis (the ""damage"" refer to) common complication flu viruses.

It makes realize editing matters. envision army people writing articles trying get clicks, trying figure make headline sensational possible... little bit spin $50 thank you.  Every country makes mistakes, faking perfect picture destroy image. went ER 3 days vaccine petechiae. took 2 weeks die.

Not sure related, random death 2 weeks later either.  fairness old testament god shown one time really enjoy good bloodbath Thank this. appreciate Oh yeah. unbelievable things tagged ""good news"", good news people want measures lockdowns. Leave alone. He’s proselytizing. He’s sharing experience perspective. He’s allowed believe whatever wants, history withstanding. came nowhere make point nobody needed hear. get it, you’re atheist Reddit. brave you.  understand, given importance vaccination 24/7 operation. virus fucking sleep, keep office hours. would happy go get jab 3AM heard expert say ""world ending crisis"". 

But trust experts actually saying. important incredibly dumb think various efforts, masks, lock-downs etc. protecting personally. collective effort keep total level infection society low possible.

When government say can't go bar, must wear mask **not** personal protection. saying ""we helping protecting yourself"". reason lot people seem believe this. think like this: ""But young, risk negligible. feel safe, important"". completely 1000% irrelevant., seriously, nothing anything. keeping total number infections low possible, keeping R-number low. Virus mutates, like water wet.

There point hyped every mutation unless behaves significantly different. rapture them, supposed die? I'm confused. I’ve really struggling thing. haven’t heard Christians denounce Trump. keep doubling supporting claims pro-life, completely ignoring every single thing does. It’s sickening watch. since wednesday saw white terrorist look like, color blind  🎻🎻 It’s Facebook era. Everyone thinks they’re smarter could literally kill them. 

For easy decision.....what doctors doing? Oh they’re getting vaccine? Done. Got first shot last week I’m elated 80% protected next days even dose two. 

I’m healthcare worker frontline elderly. feel slightly guilty getting parents chance didn’t want risk turning getting bumped couple months. parents get next week I’m even thrilled that. big news portal tv indo say same

I’m pretty sure person’s original statement wrong. Yeah true. Three reasons why: firstly winter season, secondly people caring less pandemic, thirdly (in Europe) spreadable variant.  leader done can. /s would know that? hard lockdown anywhere far variant widespread.  ^This. kidneys shut next year list. took ten minutes per person give 60 million vaccines you’re talking 1100 years time get done. 2200 years time injections.

I feel dumber read this. I'm beginning think states software create database/registry like that. Many states struggled unemployment benefits due outdated software/systems, example. China lies data, Cambodia extremely poor 3rd world doubt testing/detection remotely reflective reality. Also, heat humidity SE Asia likely pretty helpful aerosolized virus spread ADN BSN MSN confirm. They're also old refuse educated think know everything. Five different ones. lot old people bequeath money church whe die. could really work him

On one hand, they’ve seen effects become numb like “another one dead, moving next” like it’s another day office. hand, may mindset “this going almost year haven’t gotten it/died yet it’s whatever”. strawman? said April. set remind April. issue?

Well, vaccinated bit earlier followed general pattern. like :/ :| research like :D Here's latest case/death charts Florida, running 7-day currently 103.68 deaths per 100k. ranks Florida 25th US per capita So.. think change strategy? feel bad Japan. honestly point cancel.

They're smart people 2022 Winter Olympics World Cup. much sport, especially Olympics run December months, World Cup (stupidly) scheduled run. Yes do. Since lockdown Belgium lowest numbers Europe. One would therefore conclude particular lockdown working.

Meanwhile, people still wear masks they're gatherings &amp; parties like everything totally normal. workplace 8+ people covid, one ended oxygen, people still refuse take seriously. believe months back decided can’t safely held summer, won’t held all. think options like spectators table, pushing even another year determined option would disruptive training timelines lot sports—that is, 2022 would time start training 2024. haven’t read anywhere. I’ve seen it’s like 8/14 days(?) RemindMe! 3 Months ""Life back normal"" Agreed. Still doesnt make easier :( totally agree. internet ever done me!? welcome:) know several people tiers general population definitely want it, way sign yet. Unless advocating mad black friday dash local CVS, we'll still need sort sign up, exactly suggesting? Prisons need pastors too. general consensus canceling event collapse economy.

Uhhhh what? Why? disagree Olympians getting younger. I'm thinking primarily Simone Biles without doubt would Olympic gold medalist, clock ticking long she'll prime. 

I think lifetime work training people put sports deserves set aside people entertained without crowd. FYI - Christian. live Alberta Canada 300 km north Calgary. also attend Baptist church. 

The pastor church article wrong many levels. Bible instructs us submit governing authorities unless government forcing us contradict God's law. Wearing masks social distancing contradict God's laws.

Since covid restrictions place small church attend started live streaming services started holding 2 services Sunday incorporate many people possible. followed government restrictions still function church God.

Here Alberta daily case numbers finally started come down. Christmas posting 1500-1700 cases day. 1000 cases day. proves restrictions working. Feels kinda shitty one 'essential front-line workers' since day one...and left till end list feels like get vaccine. job never closed, got busier people home, deal directly face-to-face people...I help hundred different people day. wish could get vaccine. Yes good DK. 

I'm disappointed happened thinking while, get it. people involved horror year, things control, last chance take time off. Danish colleagues easy comparison. 

Flip side... everyone vaccinated summer. brief daily reading jp.dk politiken.dk gather going much worse Danmark, min gamle ven ;). sounds right HM, surprising number anti-vax nurses. Met one onboarding there. makes feel better, I'm 30 years old, sex since 26 years old(and ask who, led circumstance), I've still never girlfriend life. That’s actually spot response would expect someone going casino every day. wasn’t causing problems , would concerned. still plethora dumbasses spreading thing around. THANK would like hear dead people. 😤 want this. Someone else wants teachers. Someone else wants grocery store ect ext. technological expertise develop thing. registry would require advanced technologies pen paper, beyond reach poor country.

I wonder extent could backfire create mass hysteria ""government vaccine registry"" Wait, vaccine prevent spread? told shown prevent disease. problem vaccinating poor likely co morbidities worse access Healthcare Thanks! That's really informative! point, way look it. know grim, way mentally withstand mess look opening bright spot. thought olympics doesn’t return lot money, instead gentrification area hosted olympics becomes prosperous hence generates money?   Luddites. Yahoos. Yaddites. Ludhoos. 

I'm sure word conveys abject poverty thought combined selfishness narcissism play here. Again, NYC, 1940s, hundreds thousands people got vaccinated basically overnight. Within three weeks deciding vaccinate people, millions one city inoculated. 


Developing testing vaccine always ""difficult"" applying finished product person's arm via syringe. Fauci scientists stated ""start normality"" fall end far less 7 million vaccinated US, we're lucky hit 1 million week vaccinated, take us end summer. actually hit 2 million week, well might see semblance normalcy *by* Summer 2021.

I know there's talk 2 million day seem struggle get 2 million week. Sitting home unable anything handful State-approved activities losing lifetime. Lifetime taken away protection people.

There life merely existing. Hey wanted share CVS aiming vaccinate LTC facilities 25th.  I've found people often appear simple they're interacting someone else something person proficient them.. Apparently Opening Ceremony costed LOT, sucks they'll scrap that. US poor lacks technological expertise develop thing. registry would require advanced technologies pen paper, beyond reach poor country. Agree you. It’s “thing”. Negative press hoarders won’t hoard. It’s suggested year. give 2032 Olympics. literally arent. half assed wearing mask whilst going daily routine (and never, ever caused loss life suffering) eliminated flu season. loss life suffering due deadly disease, mitigation disease. Nobody dying cloth face. Nobody dying can't overfeed restaurant. Hell home cooked meals probably making everyine healthier consuming weeks worth food one sitting WV made right choice allowing small pharmacies state administer vaccine instead waiting CVS Walgreens. first dose already 100% complete LTC facilities second dose done well. mean, “making religion die” isn’t exactly valid policy goal Western democratic country, sooo... time get see Jeff Dunham year.

I dont see could argue event cancelled rolled everything forward.

A train cancelled train come next one regularly scheduled train.

This Tokyo Olympics 2021 2022 delay 2020 ones. cancel wait 2024. add new one different place. delayed .25 [units time]. think new strategy based Israel's, given twenty percent population shot.

It’s worth noting 20% Israel’s population 1.3 million people. US given enough vaccines today vaccinated 92% Israel’s population. 

Israel’s strategy small, dense country public health care system centralized record keeping whole nation. US absolutely zero way replicating success (just look Florida example state that’s distributing vaccine purely based age). Source? regards NY throwing doses Fine, give 2032 Olympics. losing lifetime.  Much like Olympics, reschedule. educated enough believe know better enough actually understand science. failure distribution baffling. There's reason priority list made advance vaccine ready inoculation.

- local/state health department decides gets first, healthcare workers, essential, old people, etc... back fall. 

- Contact employers, ask employees want it. Use voter registration info ad campaigns contact elderly ask want put list.

- Compile priority list based that. info shipment sizes arrives, apply list start making arrangements appointments. get cold feet get standby list look next person list.

In real world still get delays errors ultimately start throwing vaccine doses like NYC clinics have. true wait month second dose, get full immunity vaccine? don’t mind debt virus wracking up? Many hospitalized long-haulers 65+, that’s taxpayer dollars, well testing, supplies, private insurance, increases private insurer rates majority employer (rates go us). 

Forget health ethical issues minute- many poor understanding economics fiscal viability?

I hear shingles actually worse chicken pox. dry state it? partying utah? don’t know you? Sorry nurse? dealt bs? seen ppl die front you? I’m 27 grandma needs vaccine me. dare we’ve war think still give shhhh. Wow. Rude inconsiderate clue. dare judge us. We’re ones making nothing bs country doesn’t give damn us. honestly fuck calling dumb clue took get I’ll help grandma. I’ll bet she’s like me. God gave brain, use it. Phew! I’m glad done timely fashion! It’s though. lot nurses personally know well educated least. There's high chance rural areas could see high % infection population risk older folks suffer severe complications,

If 20s-40s people know got covid major complications, would trust outside ""experts"" decrying world ending crisis look experiences around go, ""I see big deal"". far know, Florida report non-resident deaths cases, significant number state tourism destination.

This one things Rebekah Jones objected to, Florida's cooked numbers. argument applied ebola vaccine, live area ebola rampant, absolutely right wait. 

But makes incandescent rage say vaccines may harm good vaccine ever come even vaguely close harm Covid currently doing. thing matters long run reproduction number larger smaller 1. smaller 1, matter time spread eliminated, Europe problem keeping 1 summer. Even Sweden never locked saw decline cases since April.

But winter came R value shot roof Europe again. evidence seasonal effect can't clear. really easy control printing press. Yea know says considering real looking about, mentions, England.  went cremation week ago today. think case unpopular accepted. personal preference individual/family they/their family want deal it. I'm curious; fact tested pregnant women puts off, something else too? feel like there's middle-ground whereby pregnant people counselled risk: covid one hand, uncertainty vaccine pregnancies other. understand covid particularly harmful pregnant recently pregnant people many uncertainty vaccine worth it. Thats result modt people egomaniacs dont care happens others. Religion never get tax exemption first place. freedom religion, religion gets leg People watch first one full year.

But we're talking totally different disciplines here. can't image people like: ""Bobsled? Nah, I'm good, already watched pole vault year"" putting people's lives risk sound religious They're strict data understand plan release data prelim analysis dump. used rather strict cutoff considering kidney damage. EGFR &lt; 90. Based normal eGFR values 93 50s, 85 60s, 75 age 70+. lot old people data set, 38% “failing” eGFR 90 criteria alarming.

Note Lancet study draw attention 38% figure. Instead, chose highlight first time, showed 13% patients without acute kidney injury normal eGFR acute phase decreased eGFR could due general wasting away lack exercise due hospitalisation followed months Wuhan quarantine, maybe virus caused it. It’s hard tell. need resources live long enough, think one lockdown lasts forever.

I hope family ok vaccines work every variant layoffs.  🤖 Baller. People caring less less Covid hysteria. two hour wait times restaurants town Saturday night. Goddamn people stupid everyone already die? tumor removed years ago Hypothyroidism. counts chronically ill appearently gives higher priority. friends Asthma diagnosed kids. one single seizure young age never anymore afterwards. Counts chronically ill tho gets higher priority.

With want simply say chronically ill totally live normal life. guess people think tied bed forever constantly sick something. example EU everyone wants one vaccines get end May, early June pandemic completely European Union.

That's wishful thinking based promises politicians. I'll believe actually happens. vaccination process far disaster. Shut down. Confiscate assets. Put money towards COVID relief Pamela Addison (the lady main photo) also done interview [Stolen Goodbyes sad story, widowed two young kids too... Academic Times? Never heard before. honestly blame you. He's worst. They’re painfully average ranking. Holy crap. Oh vote numbers underestimate, though spikes dubious sometimes cases weren’t counted confirmed thrown they’re corrected. average curve best bet things headed. Americans get sense superiority? Absolutely bizarre given reality world. Hey, cleaning staff truly deserve need it! keep covid wards disinfected them? I’m nurse incentive lie? don’t incentive anything situation. job love people want vaccine please take unfortunately got Covid messed mess need me. Good luck  people really understand studies looked hospitalized patients
They researching hospitalized patients symptoms i.e. people hit heavily covid. make study unreliable, different question half discharged patients refused participate (so really random sample)

Legit concern, still discharged symptoms significant enough even half show that. concerning nonetheless suggest long covid thing, even estimated incidence rate biased due sample selection whatever reason. job give reason bias critic. driver sample selection, reason concern lower sample size.

People really get kneejerk ""not random sample"" even participating mean anything lower sample first. control group mentioned. idea common (minor) problems reporting general population.

Eh, would control group? infect one half covid not? look population similar characteristics hospitalized people compare them. RCT. 🙃 French lockdown spring included following measures:

1. report government leaving home wait authorisation (so many people would go shopping). stopped street, would show authorisation;
2. go shopping, stay local possible (1 km within cities, rural areas);
3. exercise allowed outside home;
4. non-essential employment (construction, business-to-business sales, takeaway food, etc.) shut down, non-essential retail personal services businesses. Obviously power generation, firefighting, etc., continued (although argument workers ""bubbled"" avoid impact);
5. government made generous support payments affected.

It may sustainable, least possible without society collapsing, least long enough give time competent vaccine rollout. military killing people countries 'containing' stage  Time tell. Ah come full circle. Fine indeed. Lmao visit family doctor get Covid test also patient. japan lowest testing numbers developed countries less tests even many developing countries.

It seem like many cases japan purposely attempt detect (see olympics).

By looks article, japanese blindly believe numbers instead context behind numbers.

Now seems community spread control even horrible testing, ton cases showing up.  bad country founded prison though far shit. fined 10k showel x50 that. is. Apparently there's already one article... Sounds terrifying... whole purpose visit rubber stamp China's version events. forever refer visit. ""But allowed investigation, found nothing!"". 

It would better trip happen all. think rules applied forever? point new variants vaccines becoming useless, long going measures? $1,000 credit card debt, pay back $500 it, fact still credit card debt mean repayment enough, repayments work all?

They kind lockdown, (with limited restrictions Christmas December, current hospitalisations would transmitted) since November, one designed limit ""international"" variant virus. case, seems strong enough stop transmission November but, second half lockdown, cases London (which quite low) began grow eventually got control. 

Even ""lockdown,"" people still go work can't work home, still get takeaway hot food, still shop supermarkets essential retailers, still exercise crowded public places. seems enough virus, mutated form least, continue spread. 

The lockdown reduced transmission ""a truckload"" ""a lot"" that's still enough cause big problems. Ah, coffin Wi-Fi. What's like? 2024 Paris. &lt;We need give personal narratives stick science.

Yep, that's dismissed almost everybody except whack jobs trying get Facebook famous. patients hospitalized? What's also pretty satisfying one one morons shares ""empty hospital"" photo video, find date stamp pre-pandemic. Calling shit like picking scab.

Christ, they're fucking stupid. shit takes time ya know wants parishioners money.  also, get HPV elsewhere, like [Changing room  Look Mister King George England Here! Get Pitchforks! Nah Nature healing! could less worse situation new strains around transmissible thing that's driving lot cases number countries, definitely think we'd near back normal. That's point hoped Germany would summer lol. Props them. anyone else wondering, that's roughly 11k Arizona. 😉 alternative would exactly? Death?

She’s yet get kiss Seal though fact people actually want continue wearing mask pandemic honestly sad. I’m wearing mask stop COVID. flu?
We vaccine soon vaccine readily available everyone Covid. reason flu numbers lower usual people getting flu vaccine

If wanna wear mask everything go it. I’m good though, I’d rather breath nice fresh air doesn’t fog glasses actually enjoy rest life. want slave pandemic it’s that’s choice. 

I can’t say I’m surprised people sub want continue wearing mask Covid. coronavirus sub reddit 🙄 California 39th deaths per capita Florida 25th. 

Agreed New-York though. Cuomo totally incompetent, continues vaccination campaign. praise gets obscene. He's actually worse DeSantis Abbott, far worse Newsom. Brian perfectly fine thank you!! Yep, people upset lockdowns upset community following guidelines. Since certain places stop fucking essentially forced lockdown. Fucking people follow rules want try live somewhat ""normal"" life. Chinese scientists already research March last year government put gag order it. never released findings. envision 6 year old would go police wasn’t illegal? Or, makes think law enforcement punishes children rescued?

I get impression discussions people tend antiquated understanding prostitution. partly due conversation years it’s framed, media, publicized stings forty years ago.

Modern prostitution sex slavery operates world sane people can’t comprehend stomach. career I’ve come across cases elicited physical illness veteran law enforcement—some hardened detectives killed things they’ve uncovered.

Right vaccines rolling out...  good, can't wait day they'll open normal purposes! Damn, homemade grandma tamales hit different, Im hungry Oh, fully agree. people video chat with, people don't, miss can't *be them.* made come conclusion? Financial solvency, education, mental health would call 'short term satisfaction'. two weeks March, might point. Things changed dramatically since. 

As risk: vast majority population COVID-19 pose significant threat lives. country (Israel) 92.5% COVID deaths age 60, 72.5% 70. despite 12.1% confirmed cases 70. 

Given statistics, believe shielding prioritized risk, whether due age and/or underlying conditions, allowing rest population live normally.

While certain risk death long-term health complications COVID exist everyone, think large enough justify draconian measures like forced business closures restrictions people's movement. Despite ever present risk death maiming car accidents, continue drive every day, society think risk worth benefits cars provide us. 185 million doses 370 million doses end June, since person requires two doses. Pandora's box dates 7th century BC. Christians invent hope. *Hello, 911?*

*I’d like report murder.* anywhere tracks states getting more, state sitting 109k received week now, used 92k far, states must burning allotments too. I'm everything avoid car accident cruising around town! solution make everyone happy

I mentioned root problem provided potential solution. mentioned outcome problem suggested way alleviate outcomes cascading problem you’re offering anything substance begin need people work

That’s understandable ultimately meaningless point view without contextualizing defining work value consider “endless growth” ultimate object.

We need happy healthy society function within confines economic structures allow demand. One many components work, however many termed work demand workers changing fast pace, changes demand new economic political system. changes central powerful, face lumbering giant automation, democratic socialism universal basic pay work, work, incentive gone.

That hasn’t proven true studies UBI. fact people tend happy healthier begin seeking alternatives types work shoehorned prior study.

The system capitalism uncovered antiquated disgusting go rabbit hole capitalist consumerist culture. Read article entirety though. Lots interesting findings. learned kid's hospitalization numbers far serious realized, yet still alarming extent. 


It covers time period March November, conclusions study could theoretically quickly evolve mild severe direction, based potential impact youth many new variants sprouting everywhere. guys maths third, strongly suspect many people like myself, willing get vaccinated turn came long assured getting second dose timely fashion, thinking prudent wait - even delay means months longer home - things calmed enough assured receiving appropriate doses appropriate schedule.

1. would prefer 0% protected 90+% protected weeks, unknown level protection thereafter?

2. refuse, means get dose (or two) sooner. First doses first considered demand vastly excess supply.

3. two points almost moot Biden really first doses first. Unfortunately, still extremely likely get second dose schedule (just new production rather reserved stock). Given official medical experts’ propensity tell white lies order get behavior feel beneficial us all, something tells might difficult time getting info case. plus people push back hard second sit butt/no fun allowed/watch tv summer. Yeah...let’s go concerts Broadway shows winter 2024 fucking flu. 

Give break. Flu season also half year!  Yeah, factories built summer. might reason people aren’t alive, you’re okay spreading virus. like wait see approach. Many people aren’t anti vacs want make sure it’s safe see problems others  wish case PA... we’re way far away long touch three days virus dies poop fine lays Second this. I’ve told several flu everything marked COVID extra money hospitals get. fact wearing masks seeing less people....  That’s even close true. Since 100 people win lottery every day Florida alone? bewildering r/Coronavirus constantly positive headlines California negative headlines Florida. Florida ranked 25th country right despite rejected lockdowns mandatory masking California sits top three worst states country. Los Angeles lifted lockdowns day since March yet worst spot *entire fucking world*. people try say COVID political issue look reporting see 100% is. New York butchered response every step way yet Cuomo praised hero. Stop pretending we're together giving information agenda. nursing home death total 21 residents 62 full capacity. people older 74 conditions well though. you’re elderly conditions covid kill quick. happened within month. remember CCP telling us this! welded people homes Remember people vote even encouraged to. friends flew CA Miami New Years. downward side peak Christmas New Years rolled around... expect start trending shortly though absence holiday season. droplets sneezes cough airborne I'd think like spray bottle, seems land surfaces even products anywhere. Many probably wash hands going picking items, opening doors, paying cash.

I'm going risk it. people mad him? He’s absolutely right. Great question. [Bloomberg Vaccine fine provides forward projections whatsoever. I'd like see single graph showing projected versus actual: 1) dose delivery 2) doses actually arms. retrospective projected, nationally state state. Clothes invented yet -1. know will. They'll probably kill gorillas... long time ago masters online university north dakota. computer engineering class one example problems program wind chill/temperature certain parameters. example put result 4 degrees F professor addressed class said wouldnt lovely today.

Me, confused los angeles watching remotely, decided check weather grand forks. -25 degrees F. way mean negatively towards Fauci, timeline things open, return normal, etc. keeps changing. know new information learned, things things bound change. point is, don’t think anyone knows accurately predict back “normal” actually get there. Vaccine's back menu, boys! [The model, think CDC relies on, deaths peaking based data thru Dec. 20 quite accurate cumulative deaths now. 

The daily predicted death toll bit high today even deaths peak next days, could remain fairly accurate. However, infections peaking Christmas Eve think took account holiday surge (unless look ""mandates easing"" line, scary).

I'm sure model due updated, assume unreliable reporting around holidays makes updating difficult. Oh yeah. Mother law said thing. said fill car enough groceries month. fantasy land created involves marshal law. also thought Pope arrested yesterday human trafficking. difference? Maybe worldometer also counting Puerto Rico, Guam soldiers abroad? giving vaccine? first: even bad last year. specifically concerned about? hardest thing us getting toilet paper while, even real issue. area lockdown while. laughed second. cried.

I seriously think that's going happen (the told part, actual people following it). really, differing opinions. think everyone risk lives lockdowns seemingly care anything short term satisfaction. think need take all-of-the-above approach push different channels,” Dr. Gottlieb said, “including big-box stores, including federal sites Biden administration talking standing up. need try everything right create multiple distribution points.”  it’s consensual legal. Lonely men get intimacy, women can’t get jobs get money .  let pandemics originating china keep bringing world knees scared offending difference masks work better flu/cold, cause droplets contain covid vs flu get smaller covid still survive, meanwhile flu dies easily bigger droplets, besides small droplets fly longer remain floating longer time. Seriously, Golden Chancla award? not, I'm making one. Problem: states can't utilize vaccine have, vaccine beginning spoil

Solution: lets send vaccine!

This either stunningly stupid explained Biden team and/or press incorrectly. Stop what? realistic reopening? Even conservative vaccination estimates, don’t see scenario venues theaters open summer. everyone stuck though.  women charge 400 hour, work days week make BANK. want work normal job. Money metric. sell concert tickets requiring masks vaccines haven’t reached young adults, absolutely mandate it. retail stores, won’t remove mask requirements early concerned turn away unvaccinated customers. People don’t seem realize young adults don’t want get sick even risk bad reaction low. sick time don’t have, worrying family members since shot isn’t 100%.

I think masks stay place anyone wants vaccine, get rounds done, probably July-August. expect businesses want good businesses, they’ll probably also lobby Govt take heat them. rather engage anything said? blame Trump admin lol, know plan better, holdups specifically related priority politics worth acknowledging. That's great news. I'm cautiously optimistic given Dakotas, Montana, etc. indoor dining bars seen another wave.

U.S. wait U.S. data.  shows good news SA though would shocking U.S. didn’t show similar. quote Draper Mad Men, shocked quickly never happened. second visit olive garden ask want breadsticks going think, weird eat inside. 4% discrepancy means could related viruses found bat populations Europe anywhere else Asia seeing horseshoe bats exist continents. would imagine masks would thing 2022 many areas. I’m guessing less urban areas drop masks quicker cities. J&amp;J announced they’ll releasing data 21st definitely Damn. might become Chimera virus. Honestly shove it. vulnerable vaccinated (which literally finished Israel ramping many countries) need start opening up. That’s whole point restrictions! one ever said herd immunity mustn’t anything. vulnerable vaccinated that’s it. U.K. massive push get many people vaccinated flu year. sure countries. opinion piece well, things. sure way know. antibodies reportedly fade months, less severe reaction, fewer antibodies first place. probably huge population people exposed would show test even tested them. knows could half population more. Would able order online overseas, perhaps? 🙂 Also easy pop crock pot. know getting downvoted telling truth. can't conclude anything outbreak detected first China either then. goes ways. Wrong thread. bit complicated that.

Firstly, chance catching virus proportional number people currently ill spread disease. people vaccinated, group grow smaller, less risk.

Secondly, probably practical allow people already vaccinated freedom. Trying distinguish workable. everybody follow rules, vaccinated not. least fir little while.

Mind you, goal vaccinations protect virus. goal reduce infections us safe again. subtle difference important. affects government makes decisions. get thing control, make rules us, us. 

Of course protected getting vaccine, OK. moment someone insist first detected really matter terms finding origin. simply cannot stay closed vaccine hits critical mass. cost high. nothing left open. must reopen economy, must smartly Daily case number start mean less less vaccinations happen though. Setting record daily cases shouldn’t matter get point vulnerable vaccinated hospitals aren’t risk. demographics cases matters total number hospital let us float covid icu get sick three patient assignment critical care hard good day. guarantee I’m knocked ass covid top that, patient outcomes suffer. Given contagious areas clearly insufficient precautions, see spreading least much.

It way actually good news. 25-35% population already exposed we're vaccinating another 5-10% next weeks we're inching towards truth. disagree, although i've tasted peruvian tamales.

Homemade nice orange ones restaurants mind blowing delicious. Pfizer think boats missed going away. hope I'm wrong vaccination help us eliminate think first anti vax movement significant die change heart get unfortunately. That's beautiful thing remember ❤️ I'm sorry loss, sounds like great memories her!

Man, used work fortune 500 company tons managers would spew sort nonsense like meaningful. Yeah Cuomo de Blasio arguing weeks. Looks like de Blasio finally going get way NYC (not NY) though Cuomo want spank him.

Basically adults take care filling kids grunt work milling corn forming tamale. clicked laughed like beavis butthead took PNAS website. I’m apparently still 12 year old. That's said. I'm talking getting point people feel safe, financially confident enough return considered normal before. Fall 2021 overly optimistic, delusional. Honestly though really cold masks nice. Like scarf face that's easy breathe through. yeah chance people follow long term. anyone know big SA arm was? Would FDA consider us arm ? Usually early morning edit edit later day 18th MLK Day stock market holiday. So, maybe Tuesday instead?  wouldn’t surprised majority MLB teams fans seats opening day. That’s late March/early April there’s reason states still restrictions they’ve vaccinated vulnerable population  J&amp;J especially promising because: (1) single-dose; (2) vaccine stable regular refrigerator temperatures; (3) J&amp;J says capacity produce 1 billion doses year. (And vaccinated person require one dose, two.)

Hopefully J&amp;J meet goal filing data needed FDA EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) month. SEC full capacity like virtually nothing changed. Guaranteed. Yeah run numbers. Say one person virus infects average 4 people within 2 weeks. 50% immunity person infect average 2 people instead. period 10-20 weeks difference enormous due exponential growth.

When get say 75% immunity person infect one person. Game changer combinatorics perspective. could genomic sequencing really isn’t main point. also need test everyone identify potential spreader someone else also infected actually infected sheltering. Yep that's exactly right. pretty much hit nail head.  Literally year away, point vaccines available worldwide. Seems like anti-China fearmongering. Hehe. used /u/Busch-Diesel periodically nuke accounts. sure next username. Good you. Seriously. fully expect people wear masks every day on. That’s choice. issue it. we’re emergency scenario unacceptable imposed others. rather people die wear mask feel ill? standard mask wearing world think could sick, wear damn mask feel better. Granted course normal times think expectation would wear one perfectly healthy.

There's zero reason responsible person want wear one feel sick go out. feel may coming something feel bad enough yet warrant taking sick day.  I'm sure many become homeless, there's also lot table manual labor women tend hired do. Living situations also different. single man might able couchsurf get cheap room rooming house situation easily woman child. woman child needs consider childcare - onlyfans done home. get vaccinated. Well, it’s difficult. Plasma less specific erythrocytes, frozen don’t match RhD+/-, millions transfusions administered different reasons year hospitals used monitor patients transfusion reactions. 

What problematic keeping supply convalescent plasma. donor give 3 transfusion doses time, Europe go 14 days transfusions. also need sufficient levels antibodies, veins take repeated apheresis donations. big bottleneck supply plasma. mom, grandma, great aunt great uncle getting shots early Feb. 

I haven’t happy months! Exactly... herd immunity on/off switch degree. better anywhere around 40%+ immunity significant positive effect. Last year's flu vaccine 39% effective. Didn’t hear? god-given inalienable rights US founded “FrEeDuMbS” now. Even restrictions justified set dangerous precedent much power government maybe next time won’t justified 1 every 13,157 people younger 50 I’m actually you. don’t think going carry many places past June. think demanding sort firm date unknowns tad unfair. You’re never going get answer won’t happy answer. 
What’s likely happen eyes places like NY, CA, stay tight restrictions FL, SC, OH, get back close normal. place like MI middle we’ll get pressure neighbors move forward faster. Ohio land unmasked promise lot people visit Ohio spend money instead here. makes perfect sense, I'm rando electrician, try pass along know passed filter reliable sources. means err side caution, I'm okay that. CDC site shows 8,987,322. Pretty serious lag Bloomberg. awesome lady! bet damn good tamales! I'm concerned privilege aspect much concerned non-vaccinated anti-maskers stop using masks taking basic precautions, lying vaccinated. We've already seen large numbers qualms lying ADA protected medical conditions (and buying stupid laminated cards). cause non-trivial increase viral transmission almost surely put people waiting vaccines greater risk. would like make point vaccinated without getting ill. year, projected revenue shortfall $15 billion largest state history, amid widespread economic carnage, Mr. Cuomo said. “Businesses lost, lifetime savings exhausted, personal debt mounted,” made clear state needed “to jump-start economy now,” promising New Deal-style program invest infrastructure, including air, rail, road projects well housing.

It time put economy ahead lives. think still wear masks well end 2021/early 2022 even places start open again? Serious question - hate masks social distancing love following guidelines - I've wearing masks everywhere going anywhere unless essential seeing zero loved ones since March - important save lives... can't lie pretend happy restrictions wanted see others thought. Awww. sweet. made smile. 38th today - there's doubt going move next weeks (and that's treatment benefits nearly year study). could infected night before, walked building, dinner, etc.. testing people room prove infected her? know. 3 vaccine manufacturers press releases Monday submitting data FDA stock price increases week. I'm expecting J&amp;J same. mandate requirement test everyone, pretty ad hoc, due part people want work places require it.

However almost everyone wants get vaccinated. Realistically wonder many 260M actually get it. would say least 10-20% country simply refuse. Sorry run government. may hate tories mean can't something right. listen folks trying justify special privelages vaccinated. I'm you, that's stupid. thought already done whole special privileges thing Jim Crow laws, turned well it. That’s kind getting at. different small rooms. pretty easy identify room test people contact tracing perspective means congressperson active contagious COVID infection. even myocarditis isn’t usually permanent stemming viral infection Tell couple months wrong think pace vaccinations going increase significantly next 2-3 weeks.

New York example 3700 POD's (points dispensing) planned state, first started 50 active currently 650 are. that's 5-6x increase.

Other states using stadiums, hotels, large public spaces give 1000-2000 shots per day coming online now.

The constraint currently vaccine supply example New York getting 300k per week. reports federal government holding back supply case manufacturing disruption Biden intends reversing that. Also manufacturing seems going well pharma companies upping projected numbers.

We pretty close 1M per day today (went approx 8.02M 8.9M far). think 2M per day within weeks go there. embarrassed ask sources age internet. Go due diligence like called out. yet offer sourced rebuttal, even took time entertain laziness.

I provided sources explained impression choosing act immunity might last long even gave saying also fair interpretation. Yes, scientists believe likely longer, lack evidence therefore cannot advise acting beliefs.

But even though seem angry, kind enough describe comment word salad. agree, health conscious decision, also pretty tasty. salad suited taste, matter preference only.

Come back learned Google. much prefer spend time discussing obtuse individuals least take time teach something. Why, though? can’t one thought process I’m sensing you. missing something here? concerned transmission disease, or..? elderly 80+ frontline workers Tier vaccine distribution clearly says Queen **and** Prince Philip control you, ignore little nerds get vaccine. people want return normal pathetic pandemic they'll still pathetic after. literally dozens us! Maybe misunderstood you; calling politicians suppress protesting elections? thought virus particles travel droplets aerosols much larger virus itself? Man, let's hope there's snafu distribution.

It pedal metal run either vaccines people vaccinate. No, he's right. said ""way 500k"" closer would mean 750k.  right first time, ass. I’m loosing perspective. dawn 3M P-100 face mask now? mean, they've shown reduce curve again. hey, Americans never even bothered lock spent 2020 fucking licking say work. Clearly data must wrong. Lol become ”no true scotsman” fallacy point. country true lockdown, even think ”true lockdown” possible? Well, Chinese care China. problem that? tiny brain figure out? India planning use this. CoWin app planned. Anyone wants vaccine register. using unique id like SSN, verify age. medical documents also uploaded verified arrival Florida? former resident, description “playing” like “oh that’s Florida Florida things.” old deaths? Numbers started dropping two weeks following late issued mask mandate last month... Masking works. Surprise surprise... Huh? doesn’t. “and” indicates two seperate people. Saying “The Queen” doesn’t makes grammatical difference you’re talking anyway. Kinda hard separate two nobody wearing damn mask. think selfish politicians stop thinking power position. instead control pandemic outbreak stop virus spreading. Protesting elections make things worse...  say commenter said “closer 1 mil further.” read saying 1 mil. he’s right that. mean bed confined? Googleed UK learned used home visits stopped takes much time. However general doctor(PCP) still obligated home visit anyone claiming sick make hospital. wonder means community nurse worked Australia New Zealand. 4 million people Melbourne,Victoria got cases 700+ day zero locking down. agree it’s far late UK America though, especially idiots seem think it’s nothing worry about. Somehow news like come Australia. Why? Retaliation trade war? Remember Christians tried good society rather acting recklessly endangering people?  

Some churches gone far course. I’ve spoken Christians gay friends. I’ve spoken gay people Christians. Sure, hick town backwards it’s way everywhere times changing. Catholic Church accepts evolution now. Evidence shows homosexuality exists nature church evolve. It’s doom gloom don’t wake every morning spend whole day hating gays. It’s minor thing bigger picture. 

Don’t get wrong though. I’m condoning homophobia. I’m saying it’s problem doesn’t touch people’s lives.

If you’re gay though, know it’s tough. would move different area tolerable people. hear LA California nice? Liberal? thought liberals taking covid seriously conservatives not? know joke, low population help? Compare longevity time also helps. honestly rather 2022 full event everything back normal 

Yay. someobe needs example white privilege show 👆 sorry family loss, hope rest family members stay safe $10000 week $520,000 year actually. 52 weeks year 4.333 weeks month.


Typically travel nurses work assignments like every week year though, know many work like season take break. Keep mind really long work hours week too. Good money, lot work. classic collective action problem. People think people following rules feel need either. might want read countries like Cambodia Vietnam done terms mass testing. “Developed” countries struggling get results back week still aren’t free like here. Also theory true countries like Philippines Indonesia wouldn’t nearly disastrous now. little early say sure, immunity appears last long time fairly strong. always exceptions, appears general pattern far.

We understand better data comes in, take long point. DeSantis favor first dose first.

I think official policy Florida, I'm guessing he's going push default.

[Note: post meant make judgement that. opinions ""first dose first,"" really thread that.] Man can't take fact downvoted dumb.

Heart made glass. right here. It’s become political issue time politically extremely divided, health issue. people would literally rather die Covid admit “the libs” right honestly effort considering probably people within percentages can't get vaccinated immediately. I.e travelling, commitments, type health issue. Still better Facebook though. group tonight reading people’s thoughts vaccines. Whoooboy. journey ignorance. even know ND issued mask mandate. maybe I'm thinking SD didn't. hire Spirit Halloween Stores distribute vaccine. Could solution really simple? don’t see obvious flaws here. liberals support social democratic government. liberals centrists. Britain Ireland harder hit mainland Europe though? I'm right this, phrasing question really Please provide source “immunity generally lasting 3 mos”

The pandemic going 13 months. Tens millions infections. immunity “generally lasts 6 mos” would know now. 

Many scientists believe could years, MANY years. point anti-vaxers aren’t hurting themselves. People North Dakota particularly sparsely distributed, though. Yes, overall population density low, people live towns/cities population density normal. Can't hard transport cities. Yes well economic differences political origin current order without consequence. inequality increases, disorder ensues, wonder got back started next crisis happens, global government likely urgency governments world contend gets worse Yeah, keep virus spreading even farther, like Wuhan last year. countries, like Sweden, right-wingers pro-lockdown leftists wanted keep open. Rochester near 100% Can't wait go get mine soon I'm eligible elderly, housebound patients ages. That’s sounds like too. logical.

Weighing risk isn’t long term risk vaccine versus long term covid suggest didn’t weigh factor likelihood getting covid.. it’s 100% likelihood subjected vaccine get vaccine 100% chance get covid. I’m making argument one way another perceived risk one assigns calculation different individuals.. I'll gladly fly first world get vaccinated. fcking 3rd world country dog shit current govt. Prisons 14,100 issued 14,909 administered 105.7% shots used

Ok see many people want turn country giant prison. Possible, need Feds give states heads vaccine way states roll be. Japan extremely elderly population, surely that's factor? serious dude? many people know one family member got covid (confirmed test) rest family got sick never tested (because duh, it’s covid). know LOT those. 

And isn’t counting asymptomatic lightly symptomatic people never thought get tested  Deaths per talking elderly? sounds like UK everyone regardless age like lot states. I'm northeast different kansas empty time slots. help 95%+ sites open 8-4 weekdays people work. 2019 doctors offices pharmacies like CVS, etc. delivered 175 million flu vaccines flu season. extra effort planning. That's average 35 million month. covid unlimited money months prepare nation plan maybe 20% amount first month.   politician corrupt useless bag garbage, one willing anything save lives, right thinks need pretend vaccine doesnt exist politicians left dont want people vaccinated trump still technically president somehow think would win trump.  Governor Lamont CT let teachers vaccine trump power CT State head department education going join biden administration secretary education they've decided vaccinating needs start leadership point policy ""win"" first week.  disgusting. Sales tax anywhere 0% 7% cities/counties bringing total much more. State income tax anywhere 0% 12% average around 6% believe. Federal income tax similar yours, lower bracket, bracket 40%, highest bracket way 150k. thing everything else attempted Trumpsters: Utter incompetence. I’m list late June. We're approaching amount time since shipped

They meaning first batch, right? [The first batch 2.9M gone. 

And second batch? 9.3M doses. well way number well. Obviously lot harder say sure solid numbers many vaccines actually delivered across country.

I insist good.

It issues, people like also make shit push there. tired hearing NYC did. think comparable.

But also think everyone across world getting criticized botching rollout, maybe, maybe easy everyone thinks is.

But getting back said vaccines thrown out.

Close week. Book blocks addresses certain times.

Get people fast.

Or use arenas communities them. ...is cause everyone already dead? Delusional. New contagious COVID variants make things worse months, least vaccines measurable impact.

Yes: RR 1.1, lower CI nearly .099, would p = ns. kdhe said vaccines arms, shelves.

No. 18.5% entire population. 18.5% tests run. really bad this. unique tests could people taking multiple tests factoring numbers.

The number people given day taking multiple tests going slim. helping argument. again, 10% serology testing working entire herd immunity BS. underestimate stupid people are.

I still see idiots Twitter saying virus real calling people wearing masks stupid. accounts tens thousands followers. Ugh, bad headline... *hospitalized* patients.  That's excuse. Illinois verge bankruptcy forever avoiding it. make hires based future, stopping state right now. bad it. Italy

Is joke? think it’s like flu. would especially refuse n95s bc it’s harder breathe them.

Have seen travelling circus cabinet? think people tested? Really? “Many-fold” highly misleading. 1300 30 MILLION. already genetically predisposed narcolepsy. slow vaccine rollout one many ways prove central planning work. way? government given airlines $15 billion help adapt N95s actually filter particles smaller 0.3 microns, they're tested size (or close it) penetrating particle size that's hardest meltblown masks vary course, typically pore size ~10um, exceeds size smaller aerosolized droplets

I think simple pore size. Filtration [doesn't really work like problem meltblown masks (I assume referring commonly used surgical style masks) medical rated ASTM surgical like decent media arguably filter aerosols (although they're tested filtration stringently N95s, subjected test filter latex particles ranging 0.1-5 microns) tend fit poorly (so air bypasses it). people also using ASTM rated surgical masks unfortunately. say 0% effective (even cloth masks useless), make safe expose infected people.

Agreed. mask really does. ¥50 ND reached herd immunity, they're still getting relatively stable number infection Rt around 1: 2.2M deaths, seemed like reasonable estimate entire US population caught COVID-19. know happen, also know total effect pandemic significantly severe officially reported COVID-19 deaths.

Not excess deaths analysis putting total deaths pandemic (whether directly indirectly caused coronavirus) [35-40% higher official COVID-19 also long term effects survivors. What??? scrutinized medical undertaking ever. 

There’s also lot context pandremix you’re missing:

The patients already genetically predisposed narcolepsy, 1300 30 million, European version, American one fine. Also there’s research saying narcolepsy may even related vaccine. I’d imagine even Hades would want guy flock. Exactly. I'm saying they're correct. even think they'll run fast think. agree totally.  city monthly anti mask protests  

I wonder though. Chinese race.............It nationality. feeling might four years Olympics resume. good host cities, typically end worse-off economically Olympics. CDC rules staff medical facilities considered ""health care workers"".

That's hospitals able give admin, admissions, cleaning staff, etc. Yep. monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, dexamethasone. 

I believe doctors also yet figure intubation mechanical ventilation great covid patients. better put give patients oxygen masks nasal tubes. That’s fucked.

We 4 deaths state since january last year... total. Wtf usa I'm curious learn this. hadnt heard anything Quebec' CT cutoff seeing post. Would able link articles? might true though. original ICL projections herd immunity ~80% IFR ~0.9%. conditions, estimated 2.2 millions deaths. IFR widely adjusted 0.5% range. Herd immunity natural infection (not random vaccination) *might* occur lower levels predicted ([scientists looked natural herd immunity threshold estimated anywhere conditions (e.g. 0.5% IFR 40% herd immunity natural infection), would experience 660,000 deaths US. ~2000 deaths per million. North Dakota ~1700 deaths per million. far proven, plausible, natural immunity playing large role North Dakota's COVID situation.

Keep mind, I'm arguing *possibility* alternative explanation. still possible far unproven COVID could kill millions. North Dakota state driving 1.5 hours store fairly common. Even distributed local means, people going need much dedicated get it. Fake news: care others MASK UP. point people wanting shot problem, ""give people want it"" solution. Yes. Relative states, California *had* really well, November. Go look total coronavirus cases meanwhile much retail open city seems business usual. know people work pay rent survive hospitals full. continue get worse worse everything remains open? heard couple months ago near immunity lasts 2 years, source CDC IIRC.

However, there's absolute immunity, cases re-infections. rates small enough (less 1 re-infection 1000 contacts) almost one done thing. Hard predict. researchers think Measles vaccine helped immunity younger people. didn’t exist 1918 it’s hard say wouldn’t bad back then. We’re going researching virus decades. Downvoted you’re speaking truth. Vaccine side effects don’t pop-up couple months. pandemic, try gouvernment support much possible rest life. wont waste time everyday getting morning working 9/5 something gouvernment print asses trillions. Fuck that, whoever thinks great idea working worthless money simply loser. perhaps objectively wrong? No. Italy’s lockdown turned around massive outbreak NYC. 

I included people think lockdowns aren’t effective virus widespread. locations epicenters outbreak effectively used lockdowns turn around viral outbreak.

There ample evidence lockdowns stop spread virus even worst outbreaks.

What people say lockdowns don’t work
always forget would happen absence lockdowns. see happening world people aren’t following basic measures stop spread.
LA London two examples. 2am covid shot You’re wrong friend.

The last expression way refers Popper’s Paradox Tolerance haven’t seen Oregon called National Guard help next week. I’m suggesting give vaccination want it. drive system. participants sit cars 25 minutes post injection send way. recipients need entered national database prevent hypochondriacs trying double dose. properly staff vaccination sites get done. Vaccine sites first come, first serve digital ETAs wait times public display. people wait 5+ hours shot let them. What’s happening right ridiculous embarrassing. sucks see la YouTubers living life seemingly unfazed..... death rate Belgium quite high but, according Worldometer stats, Belgium US State would 9th highest death rate. Eight States higher rate, pretty shocking. shitty turkey dinners relatives hate. also comes people honestly never many friends social life begin with, easy clutch pearls cast judgment probably even opportunity things they're screaming people for. They're still wearing part, Menards place I've seen enforce it. Good bot everyone already get it?

According [this data (who first accurately predict official death reports back spring), [ND third population 

With common 2020 coronavirus, herd immunity achieved roughly 60% population immune, new strands start spreading across US next weeks require [~70% would instead? Considering things getting worse even restrictions really think dropping restrictions going improve things either. Let's honest, kinds people going regardless whether things legally open not. Begging playing nice try get compliance probably losing game. honestly feel like primary problems pandemic (lack availability tests, whole ""you need masks/actually shitty ones"", etc) bad almost entirely result product shortages.

Now got same. wish ""they"" would admit could done better. Also, happen 2022 winter olympics? Maybe drag 2023? 11pm curfew doesnt stop viral spread. everything allowed open anyway Like 😎 key article:

“However, new information tells us deaths, higher death rate among Americans, diagnosed not.”

He’s saying total death rate attributed COVID higher think. CFR lower undetected infections; he’s saying people dying never counted COVID-related reason.

I get point, terribly written. Dang. flu season! It’s hard separate two North Dakotans they’re wearing mask No. Look publication Pfizer phase 3 trial:[Pfizer shows graph immunity starts 12 days 1st shot 80% efficacy going 95% worth second shot eventually. we're talking going raves. nothing fair middle ground, surprised lot idiots going specifically meme think funny break restrictions.

Let's pretend there's equivalency people going mass parties (purely luxury even normal times tbh) desperate people losing livelihoods.  Clearly terrible idea. Waaay many problems. absolute disaster waiting happen. Zero possibilities. We’ll sit patiently wait state government develops efficient solution.

Edit: realized post Coronavirus Florida Coronavirus. governor’s primary strategy herd immunity willful ignorance. we’re little testy Florida know federal solution hope. trying dissuade people living want them, worry, need to. one wants move there. One hope considering countries (looking Aus) ordered enough vacinnated populations three times over. “Probably can” doesn’t mean won’t suck infecting others. Sure, won’t zero transmission vaccinated, people would infected didn’t simply cannot infect anyone.

If viral load duration symptoms reduce, able infect others but, less opportunity so, it’ll probably way still run 100m gaining 50kg: it’s likely happen lot less take lot longer. shame isn’t followed. live Melbourne prior mandate, Asian people wore masks. order came, personally saw probably 99% compliance.  Masks work. ""people get vaccinated see rest us guinea pigs died vaccine.""

*Raises hand* :)

Thanks guinea pig.

That said, I'm intentionally getting right available everyone months reckon they'll enough data feel comfortable. disease deadly, like Ebola, going asymptomatic lmfao. believe anti china brainwashed generation, also think Harry Potter real...right? People actually live North Dakota?

Can whatever you’re smoking, please? could really use hit hopium right now. CDC appears say 60 days now.

Stop ""China's lying"" nonsense

China black mystery box. many people US co-workers live China, videos get out, news gets out, KNOW happening part. 

And China mostly back normal. Restaurants open, night clubs open, businesses open, etc. way would happening virus still running rampant. Every time tiniest outbreak, gov locks entire area vengence till eradicated. 

And mean LOCKED F DOWN, like totally completely. China kicked ass virus, might like hear did. That's problem poor people minorites though. concern him. bars **open**??? fuck frontline essential worker New York end list - next group going eligible. go back work tomorrow.  4% population (with overlap vaccinated previously infected), vaccine anything significant population level. Ya'll LPNs need chill, ADN, best nurses I've ever worked ADNs.

Ron desantis, ladies gentlemen. long? virus could start anywhere happened start China, never heard anyone angry Mexico starting swine flu 2009. standard anti-China rhetoric Western propaganda. unusually mild winter ND year.

This almost certainly result mask mandate. mandate maybe 1 3 wore masks area. Today almost everyone wears mask. length time governor drug feet mask mandate criminal. month *first* dose. still confers around 80% protection itself. probably hearing get tossed around people speculating long term care residents immunity. 

it's around ten days second dose full immunity take effect.  understand new information establishes there's higher death rate, claims. higher *number* deaths understand (because relevance coronavirus unrecognized), surely *rate* relative total number cases. Given total number cases unknown, known overall death rate higher originally estimated, lower? What’re gonna work? Weird, I'm pretty sure like 90% non-medical population North Dakota believes hoax refuse wear mask. South Dakota seeing similar trend though.

China locked entire city 11 million people I’m struggling find better word “incompetence” describe CCP’s handling pandemic generally. Europe free fall response new variant entire world fell knees March speed virus vastly outpaced CCP’s subversion. It’s called tu quoque fallacy shift focus incompetence Trump faced criticism beloved flag, lacks logical cogency. incompetence doesn’t negate CCP’s. magnifies it. 

try thinking yourself. Better later never guess Well like many things pandemic really facts data people feel it.

I think people feel comfortable see sustained decline cases fatalities. think far concerned hospitalizations fatalities cases. Cases among young healthy people really issue.

But media start reporting headlines like ""cases fall 7th day row Sometown"" people really relax.

From facts figures standpoint, think 12-15% population 65+ health conditions vaccinated good get back normal. Thrombocytopenia platelet death, cause bone marrow suppression. died hemorrhagic stroke bleeding brain due low platelets (anemia) bone marrow suppression. grabbed ones mentioned post replying to, point stands. would say always goal. fleshed plan achieve that. . vaccinating since July.

Stupid people everywhere. China , Europe , USA :everywhere. Yo FUCK I’m Canadian I’m sure even gunships capable making effect! :)

But anything note, it’s Reddit representative real population. people basement dwellers, social life, they’re bitter everything world. real life experience living city Toronto people much minority real influence world, frankly voices never heard outside Reddit. No.

I mean, that's part job description, Gov Death Sentence actually *do job*. Absolutely, point point restrictions end point true herd immunity. 

I'm exactly point 25-30% people vaccinated deaths/hospitalizations fall low levels i'd still favor ramping restrictions. source supporting 1 1000 number.

I'm saying reinfection common. I'm saying possibility puts whole ""herd immunity"" idea back burner.  Oh probably diluted easier volumetric dosing grew San Antonio.

Bad news gets upvoted... join doom gloom party. Good news downvoted. Wait serious? You’re telling ^^ ^has happen order justify reason wear mask even getting vaccinated, disease that’s already 99% safe...I’ll pass. highly doubt CDC's estimates September update study showed 52.9 million total infections serological surveys ~32.8 million (which also doubt due cross reactivity B cell repertoire existing seasonal coronaviruses... 5.3% adults 42% children). Think implications saying whether makes sense. saying nationwide 1 every 3.6 people infected US. seem plausible. still lot asymptomatic people.

Which CDC estimates 40% cases turned true. half 17-20%. think 2-3x still possible.

Then show positivity rate wave double actually get 2x triple get 3x. time explaining serological testing showed 10.7% positive. HPV vaccine cause chronic pelvic pain women, something vehemently denied masked using active controls rather placebo controls. I’ve taken 3 vaccines HPV research interest me. author founded Cochran collaboration one well respected review journals worth noting got vaccine idea protected against. 200+ strains HPV still get HPV even vaccine Yeah, want look facebook comments eyes bleached Might wrong plan UK always vaccinated everyone wants one fall? veterinary surgical clinic worked (I part emergency there) used fentanyl drips big amputations always vials it. I've never seen powder form I'm sure compounding companies and/or human hospitals get way often.  think lot less 50%. 40% fatalities nursing homes less 1% population, 80% age 65+ health conditions 12-15%. vaccinate 15-20% population think numbers begin go way down.

Basically healthy people 60 little risk really carriers. protect get sick, carry want fatalities drop significantly. math make sense (FWIW PhD immunology), like said, far explanation. already know IFR really ~0.5%. That's widely accepted. natural herd immunity level still hot debate. People's careers made destroyed speak.

I think explanation possible, however, I'd want know see change Christmas. 10F outside mean Christmas cancelled. Contacts definitely increased, like everywhere else, discernible spike. youre missing 1 major point. Every shot administered sitting freezer multiple potential life saved lives. order minimise loss shortage vaccine due distribution would good Unfortunately that’s I’ve found friends idiots virus keeps growing area. Hint: “masks muzzles!” Agreed also add: beliefs unfalsifiable.

People downvoting comment intuitive, I'm technical truth hurts sometimes goes something deeply believe. I'm okay that. Whose idea blame people? wonder would vested interest that... China guilty

See... point investigating, there? reached verdict already. mean shouldn’t responsibility kid earning £9 hour enforce mask wearing agree, isn’t worth abuse customers “TAMALES TAMALES TAMALES!!!!” Yes please, extra green salsa! It’s one thing miss Texas. Minority? Look thread, asking set fires China!

If 30 years ago, gunships would Chinese waters long ago! made change second shot vaccine hoof medical backup.

Time tell whether good thing not.

I'm guessing cause issue line.

And downvote away fact remains BoZo absolute fuckwit be? country done much keep numbers expecting see comments. read data recently far, 1 1000 people reinfected COVID usually something failed immune response first time around. wish could find source that, wondering sources reinfection rates? hotly debated topic right Sadly, thoughts well. 
Even limited attendance , would sign caring . Well think articles trying make point immediately vaccination still need wear mask while.

But gets carried extreme... saying still spread virus even vaccinated, though evidence. Yes, need careful, lived vaccinated viruses decades walk around wearing masks.

I think messaging would lot easier people accept reasonable made sense. Simply telling people lock wear masks indefinitely eventually going ignored. grandma portions that's like enough 20 people?  say hungry, make  go right trash.

After all, system really advanced think /r/COVID19 chatting water cooler, sub chatting dumpsters. like every developed country? I’ve already seen comments state’s health department Facebook page. Bloomberg currently 8.02 like kid saying ""Just minute!"" mom check status cleaning room. China's horrific industrial animal farming practices live markets close human contact large factor. Much likely come country practices elsewhere. US 2019 2.8 million deaths total, hundred thousand isn’t startling almost like captain trips without 99.4% mortality rate. Thats basically Omaha is, could never handle Olympic games upgraded facilities it, would rot afterwards. gotta lot hotels, demand fairly large new build apartment complex serves Olympic village.

Its one thing host college world series 20k fans. another host Olympic games 11k athletes 30+ venues. wouldn’t go far say hard part easy part. Moderna vaccine put together within couple days. takes long trial results. actual development basically weekend. That’s putting mildly. Someone explain distribute 100 million doses flue vaccine three months fucked hard first month. It’s like states aren’t acting urgency whatsoever. doesn’t make sense. vaccinating Americans 24/7. urgency?! Japan really expect country send athletics?? going playing among themself lot people saying goes away. like magic. big difference cox2 inhibitor vaccine. arent remotely similar way. Additionally, people arthritis higher risk cardiovascular complications begin with. prexisting condition exacerbated vaccine. *prevents* condition first place. treatment. NSAID, cholesterol inhibitor, like alcohol (you're teetotaler presume). 

It's vaccine. messed creating full hierarchy. hospital workers age based oldest youngest. Done. Instead everybody pressuring based perceived value society risk level.  states way picky Twitter hordes would descend upon somebody finds 22 year old white girl straight nursing school got shot 40 year old mother 3. writer want what’s going NY doses thrown away they’re expired? Doses getting older folks seems like better alternatives even it’s chaotic - least seems like rollout happening faster speed wise. yep i've read late funding make contracts hire people actually $. know Gov. asking funding least summer knowing point vaccines would come state could get ready.

most states health departments keep numbers outbreaks, tracking &amp; tracing would time plan decently? &amp; money hire people it. know state able borrow special freezers universities help get ready. 18.5% highest positivity rate single day I'm reading correctly. Roughly 10% 3 weeks later. Roughly 10% 3 weeks earlier makes think we're near 50% total infected? I'm following reasoning.

Again, I'm taking total number people positive entire period time. I'm looking single day. I'm taking cases tested positive midway August today multiplying 3x factor. maximum positive day 18.5% I'm applying entire time period. works lowest possible calculation number lower (say 10% rate), number people tested come positivity rate would even higher. So, instead saying, ""Oh, 10% 10% there,"" I'm saying, ""For sake argument, lets make maximum possibly could say 18.5% entire period give MINIMUM number people would need tested come back positivity rate."" looked around site says 4 ways positivity rates calculated varies state-to-state. know way ND's using?

It's ND calculating it. JHU calculating it. state:

""The Coronavirus Resource Center’s current approach calculating positivity throughout site Approach 4, following reasons:"" 

Approach 4 ""The number people test positive divided either **unique** people, encounters, tests"" 

I really idea many people sort hang want cling belief ND reached herd immunity know virus comes waves. ND basically first wave and, like rest country, small second wave. third large wave like rest country experiencing. go back places large first waves retroactively claim reached herd immunity even though didn't? essentially claim people trying make North Dakota. 

We look serology testing North Dakota found here: detected 13395 total. That's 10.7%. Compare place like Manaus Brazil 44-66% positive serology testing March August. Guess happened brief period respite declining numbers? That's right...another surge kicked mid September. think North Dakota unique completely throw everything know virus coming waves window. - much life tradable someone else rights kick in? much healthy, productive, limited irreplaceable time people get take me? That's said. said know prevents asymptomatic cases prevents transmission...which worlds apart saying ""it stop transmission"" 

The way know sure would much invasive &amp; involved study relying frequent testing (which infallible) see seemingly healthy participants still COVID-free not. &amp; not, difficulties assessing transmissabiluty would interesting try work out. administered 30,000 doses opposed Florida administered 537,000. lots states. Let’s pat back hard here. Heck, advocating Chick-fil-a day - talk logistics. Seems people disagree me. see US returning normal summer, internationally? Doubtful. That’s choice point. husband work healthcare. decided yes us, sisters also work healthcare decided no. hospital system, early one obligated take it; however, eventually mandatory like flu vaccine. ask called clarification either. Mostly for.months dead people consistent testing

There alot rumors hospital prefered fake test someone died lack resources/negligence cremate directly federal orders

Add people werent trained either, back nov nurses got 30min course use respirators


Also people paid attention get admitted 80% possibility dying , became wary, people started dying home


They hired french team «recalculate» «real» death toll, well went nowhere Wear masks! Go church like go store keep mask on! We've services since we've allowed everyone wears mask. one person diagnosed covid, get church. church closed 2 weeks. cases reported. masks work. vaccine strategy? dumped vaccines onto states told figure out. didn’t even approve funding programs weeks ago. wouldn’t predict that?  shocker. like predicting this...wait Redditors anti-social losers else new. one time lives get act like heroes sitting inside watching YouTube day look people actually want see friends loved ones again. could result taking virus seriously well, would lead fewer deaths people vaccinated.  Doubt it, pretty good protection couple weeks news update release home tests OTC? It’s like must choose one other. getting that? looks like 600k/day last week. tells 'em shut fires toe line... Fuck Scott gottlieb coming Kratom dude trash. trusted tie shoes. you...a monster???? worry black market would counterfeit, expired, otherwise ineffective doses. people thinking vaccinated weren't.  agree narrative, it’s tough. taken every recommendation seriously. haven’t seen family, grocery pickup, wear masks everywhere, socially distance need see colleagues. time, government enough people say they’re following rules aren’t. It’s people’s responsibility government’s fault. going dumb idea, could individual events held bubble like NBA did? think could done figure skating skiing, maybe? opposite, want go long possible they're anti-social shut ins terrified excuse stay inside time act smug go away.  one enjoys pandemic. point easy ""staying inside watching movies."" That's slap face everyone who's lost loved ones, jobs, seen decline mental health throughout global government incompetence.   say Florida example happens officials attempt distribute vaccine still limited supply broad spectrum population. state 4.4 million people 65 older, 402,000 doses administered Friday, according federal data, fourth-highest total nation. Florida used 30 percent vaccine doses received, behind 29 states.

For people wanting give vaccine whoever wants one...Florida’s chaotic shit show STILL isn’t getting doses fast want to. Right now, no. months now, be. United States also walk clinics national data base keeping track 

This big, big problem country. Nearly everything devolves state, people absolutely freak federal control otherwise. RealID act passed 2005 fuck's sake, absolutely required October year, really folding passport requirements id driver's license state. surprise me. lowest mean age state, younger population would lead lower death rate. parents qualify vaccine Ohio February 8 (65+), vacation plans Florida late February. Ive far unsuccessful convincing cancel wait get shots.

any chance able get second matching shot Florida? deaths well fact can't act like degenerate friends person fascism reeeeeeee Actually know people permanently disabled COVID. can't work anymore. don’t want risk side effects. Honestly, live US, know many people going lives destroyed. can't imagine impact areas work done person.  Shocking half-assed lockdown anything. Exactly.

I've dealt anger depression entire adult life probably rest life. I've made peace that, point important take care mental health.

However, lot people essentially abuse notion vein ""I'm depressed can't usually I'm going break rules cry I'm real victim get caught"".

That's basically liberal partyboy/girl mentality right now. stale boring ""the government can't tell do!!!"" thing right wing libertarians running on. ""long term side effects"" expecting immunity disease *has* long term side effects? vaccine crying loud. Men take sildenafil tadalafil make dicks fall potentially kill without second thought y'all worried long term side effects class medicine never long term side effects. bonkers.

Seriously, smoke weed high school? Cigarettes? ever drink alcohol, literal poison? Ever dropped acid? Done shrooms? Speed? Meth? 

*Those* might long term side effects. Vaccines not. all. Like ever. I'm conservative - even call libertarian - lean left nearly every aspect politics.

I get good laugh fact left (like you) preaches 24/7 what's right community country unemployment highest levels ever, HOUR plus lines food banks, small businesses virtually nuked existence around L.A., VASTLY blue metropolitan area, continue see highest case/mortality #'s ever. left pretends they're morally rest country yet see spikes, breaking rules, general non-compliance everywhere else. Read article Based : 2.85 per 100 vaccinated, 45.9% vaccines distributed

FL: 2.78 per 100 vaccinated, 44% vaccines distributed  Seems science says age biggest risk factor covid death. Vaccinate older high risk prisoners staff. Problem solved. point conuntry invest big tons cash celebrate olimpycs tourism right?

So fuck japanese goverment obsesed celebrate event tourism? Keep mind covid could cause “immune activation” vaccine... could literally pathogen cause fever. articles looking immune response necessarily vaccination - fever/infection issue. it’s weighing risk covid.

I would make decision doctor random person Reddit. Someone mind sending link actual source info? news article, data CDC website something astounding.

The contrast amazing near miraculous development vaccine absolutely garbage organization actual mass inoculation mind bending.

The difficult part executed perfectly, comparatively easy part completely failed make good execution. example far successful vaccination program NYC 1940s crying loud. One problem medical workers need encouraging everyone get vax turn, discouraging anxious people accidently giving anti-vax people fuel fire.

Yes point move next tier get medical &amp; nursing schools teach vaccines graduates know concerns unfounded understand data themselves. Huh? point downplay pandemic severity. point fact subreddit acts like yoga exercising park year straight perfectly healthy normal substitution actual, real-life socialization events look forward normally get throught year. 

Zoom happy hour fun week. Netflix fun month. Saying ""I can't believe world stay home year watch Netflix!"" comes place enormous privilege disingenious people who've lost livelihoods, jobs, mental health past months. Like things, Reddit users (on sub especially) can't seem understand middle ground. believe speed up. Everywhere. still high hopes deaths drop May.  actual situation realistically people talked want go ahead virus stuff even started. Mainly it'll complete circus people living Tokyo deal event size crowded city 99% people could never hope afford attend engage way nothing costly inconvenience country benefit all. government wants go ahead reasons unrelated general population wants opinion polls gonna impact decision cancel not. extended family die Minot Friday. hospitalized 8 weeks. want optimistic might lull. Probably selfish idiots keep ignoring advice?

Libertarians individualists throwing temper tantrums like they're ones COVID negatively affecting always good laugh, though. 

You either pretend special unique world revolves around little clique debauched friends, take one team what's right community country. countrys best handling covid-19 get awards. that's Olympics 2020. Congrats surviving! Shits rough. hopefully reverse 2020! COVID long term effects vaccines....don't. long term effects immunity. What's concern? still can't believe Cuomo threatening huge fines hospitals dared give vaccine people meet strict criteria. stupid shortsighted was. makes say that? Serious question. still people fighting HPV vax even tho protects males well females cancers :(

even kid celibate marriage monogamous thereafter knows spouse obey religion too. always risk sexual assault could transmit disease. &amp; really wish people think sex outside marriage death offence via disease methods. federal plan, funding towards state’s vaccine distribution wasn’t approved coronavirus relief bill passed late December. It’s wonder states shit together. exposed twice this. Believe me, come Jesus talk he’s better. understanding US ordered millions doses vaccine candidates bet one horse. reason HCQ was, HCQ+zinc plasma, vit D, etc. Etc.

There people money made, harder people sheltering home. convince people come promise cure it, ethics damned.

Of course also money cure that's bonus, necessary FUCKING ROOM MATES, right? problem. He's already given twice. point hosting olympics huge tourism numbers Good hear - smell keeps wonky, able - get essential oils extracts flavors (baking extracts). I've told (all anecdotal point) helps ""retrain"" brain recognize things since one-smell time. Hopefully since completely gone get back relatively quickly! United States Whatever Lockdowns work federal government support. vaccine, think perfect time lock downs cases hospitalizations increasing isn’t manageable social distancing masks 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Detective Conan movie got delayed Olympics delayed, too, makes really sad. :( never going happen. You’ve got people refused acknowledge Covid, whether greed, desire consolidate power, sheer stupidity. Businesses refuse allow working home, schools refuse close. first-come, first-served approach point? know many people high risk get vaccine. Better was, though, fairly mild case. lost sense smell days (it's mostly back though bit wonky times,) headaches/pressure head (still dealing that,) well sore throat lots fatigue/light-headedness. Scariest moment took shower almost passed afterwards, laid flat bed 15 minutes kept eye oxygen never got 92 so... figured okay. Currently, mostly weak/tired, headaches sore throat still. I'm lot better though going try shower tomorrow really convince I'm good. :) many restrictions rules, certain things like seems worth prioritizing. think prioritizing extremely, extremely small sub-section United States collapse Healthcare system distribution. Minnesota would even deaths without restrictions. interaction=more spread. Jason Kenney gonna something this?!? launching domestic travel campaign completely ignoring pandemic weeks ago. According Alexa echo dot, 369,000 due virus seen that? @segal_eran Israel watching proportion hospitalizations 60+, since proportion fairly consistent, despite rises falls competing factors (B.1.1.7 variant; stricter lockdowns), vaccinated many elderly (40% 60+ ten days ago; 72% now) proportional hospitalizations start come day now, even little total hospitalizations start drop.

Wonder UK could look something similar. Seems like really focused 80+ beginning, maybe proportion hospitalized 80+ start coming soon. sure data available though. I'm crna people fucking stupid putting patients risk declining vaccine.  rich people get one first Guillan Barre discovered years later. it, going discovered quickly. literally thousands things associated GBS even flu itself. also unclear whether flu vaccine actually causes GBS. still fairly idiopathic disease.  I’m quite ashamed admit despite young girlfriend (22 20 dating 2 half years) despite remaining close lockdowns almost absolutely killed intimacy relationship seems there’s lot change that. 

I feel like shouldn’t happening relationship young age trouble forgiving problem convincing get past this. allow leniency here? feel like lot couples know aren’t going dry spell like this.

Roughly 10% 3 weeks later. Roughly 10% 3 weeks earlier makes think we're near 50% total infected? I'm following reasoning. 

Also looked around site says 4 ways positivity rates calculated varies state-to-state. know way ND's using? hospitals vaccinating workers people definitely waiting it, maybe state said x % healthcare people got vaccinations, go next step. No, Great Britain island. UK geographically politically island.

The UK comprises three countries includes thousands islands. ‘UK’ also used politically shorthand sovereign state United Kingdom Great Britain Northern Ireland. cannot find look. much sequencing far know. Anyway, would say covid-19 need mutate US. regular strain/s great little opposition many americans. much need change. /s  I'm sorry, profits people argument completely asinine. Businesses need make profit; businesses pay taxes; businesses provide employment; employees pay taxes. I'm continually fascinated notion money something live without. Money always treated want. need money live. Buy food, keep roof head, etc. Nothing free. worry, government politely requested restaurants Tokyo close 8pm. age breakdown? diminish headline, curious happening. I’d imagine contagious variant contributing tier system protect healthcare workers first, get sick, care multiple patients, domino effect patients getting help. right way distribute wisconsin fewer deaths despite larger population essentially restrictions Oh piss off. It’s nearly year. People beaten head months “there plenty ways socialize!” point shit mundane dystopian zoom happy hour.  Isn’t one appoints guy charge states public health system...? quite elderly people therefore particularly alarming.

Yikes many people want vaccine. feel like people refuse go bottom list. think many would change tune really quick. said, that’s “feel” I’m fed idiots. don’t think that’s good way go it. guy facts. Got it, case yeah agree. Although think sentiment subreddit starting come around bit accepting dissenting opinions. ""toxins"" bad. I'm going go juice cleanse remove ""toxins"" body. doubt die COVID losing many valuable years life (or many others experiencing shortened lifespans due damage COVID), hindsight preprint come fairly short predictions. good sources there, one change considerably peer review. NY, strict get it.

In FL, FFA.

Both vaccinated numbers.

I think that's interesting. Nah I'm new jersey. would think would know better now. Native Americans US received vaccines directly US government Indian Health Service. Due special govt-to-govt relationship tribes US government, US natives healthcare considered priority. I'm glad mentioned long term covid complications. Clearly can't possibly know long term complications associated vaccine, surely agree front. mind, metric one use measure besides risk death? risk long term complications associated vaccine covid surely point can't considered one other.

The link sent also states widely believed long term complications covid permanent, data required make kind definite claim. say someone's take risk vaccine, data also required, decide covid lesser danger them, us say.

I definitely camp ""the vaccine probably safe time get millions others received it"", I'll probably get regardless. point post show rationale side argument. think sides offer valid reasons whether someone chooses get vaccine ground judge person, like see lot people lately. daughter works COVID unit. got COVID 2 months ago. got 1st dose vaccine. knocked butt 2 days. 22. retrospect thinks waited. ""Armsrace"" will? us pointing japan hardly even testing anyone months now, others claim they’ve basically eradicated virus. People, you’re low amounts testing finding plenty cases, it’s spreading society. don’t care many masks people wearing. never beat it. case long ago. fast would religion die less money made since would taxed? Sister works hospital Southern California, got second refrigerated morgue delivered. hospital morgue first refrigerated morgue filled capacity want start ""stacking bodies"". J&amp;J rollout goes smoothly march could still possibility Eh pretty much risk people vaccinated months get back mostly normal life. Many experts (including UK health secretary) agree this

Also warp speed expects normal may Fauci said could hit “relative normal” April-July

It’s really common opinion sub point

I don’t think evidence supports statement man, sorry

Edit: dude post history seems support 2022 normal don’t think I’m gonna argue you, I’m objectively telling facts, good one man sorry 🤦🏻‍♂️ really hard predict get vacinated point. roll botched costing lives sure there's reason can't get caught up. JnJs approval one dose two amount stock piled probably biggest impact general population gets vaccinated.  Could call ""localized herd immunity""?

If 12.5% ND covid, that's 1 8 people, every 8th person. I'm thinking places still ""covid free"" towns reached herd immunity, averaging 12.5% across entire state.

I'm thinking statistical point view. Household/Town/County/State/Country level. downvote guy realistic outlook! Yeah states compared Illinois public school system joke Politicians business leaders necessarily smart, good managers, competent, moral persons good character. usually sociopathic hacks. want competent, smart able, elect technologists veterans, watch like bar they’re recovering drunks, IMO. saw somewhere SA variant show reliably quick tests. would effect things? mean something host cities who've spent lot money preparing host. losses scale Tokyo would still hundreds millions ($1 billion estimate Commonwealth Games). course American understand would irrelevant *you*. Yeahhhh, sure yoga gonna help mental state nothing working socializing 10 months. able finish patients effective trial.

Seeing could end situation like see seasonal flu, think matters finish 'before over' vaccines could end even effective current ones needed yearly every years could offer even protection. Good thinking. share sentiment. shall wear mask long-range public transport even pandemic over. basing on? think evidence points contrary. shhhhh, let idiots feel way, it'll make faster get it. Missouri Iowa barely skipped beat There's hilarious story behind WV law. remember, state lawmaker introduced bill ADD religious/philosophical exemptions...about 5 minutes big measles outbreak Disneyland made national news. bill debated, language added/subtracted change OPPOSITE original intent. guy introduced pissed course dropped support, folks happy sponsor modified bill, passed. 

Wish could remember details; screencaps whole delightful incident somewhere can't find them. 

That's WV; elect raging asshats like 80 percent time, every get right! :) vaccinations polling stations. Everyone assigned locations. Get healthcare staff locations. supply could shots arms orderly fashion week. Repeat process three weeks later boosters. Job done. news story this? seems like multiple healthy people dying vaccine would major international news. average age? Younger older? long logical consistency issue POV then. Lol Illinois is! Australia use Tier system Matrch pressure full crisis. US needs ramp things ASAP. Vaccinations per day need millions, hundreds thousands. FL teacher come NY get it? I'm similarly hesitant similar reasons. Also single.

It seems like definitely one side story, even COVID. agree right, also fully agree with, put, social liberals. definitely think easy EITHER ""if everyone grew responsibility stopped f\*\*\*ing partying, would control"" ""COVID flu, live fear!""  Sure. fact 150 state national leaders worse gives pause either it’s lot harder looks Reddit, may good reasons needs go bit slower. 

It’s also possible 150 leaders incompetent way, course. want say thanks forgetting Microsoft. nerd that’s mainly critique strategy, chaos plan leadership. COVID version General Honore, going get way worse, months yes still get others sick People also forgetting people won’t take vaccine already gotten sick old-fashioned way.

Probably huge amount them. free home school, no, giving bodily autonomy. saw many supporters Wednesday problem rampage would see receiving vaccine? misinformed. Everyone UK get second shot, 12 weeks first. believe want. skin back. two legit reasons taking seen months

CDC says immediate allergic reaction—even severe—to vaccine injectable therapy another disease, ask doctor get COVID-19 vaccine. doctor help decide safe get vaccinated.

Which within reason backed science/experts. healthy 20+ something anti-intellectuals people pre-existing conditions sub problem legit reason taking vaccine fear unknown(which magically apply covid). Living LA, hearing people actually working hospitals. plateauing. get worse month. months us rapidly approaching year. much longer right sit home someone else's safety benefit kicks in? much longer traded enough limited lifetime someone else's protection?

And, funny enough, family get COVID. us. Me, wife, kids, even middle aged elderly parents (who live due housing instability family worth number separate rants). know what? Everyone better. symptom 4 days loss taste smell. mom, worst, also basically better (slightly reduced taste that's left.) daughter - absolutely nothing. known without test.

Some virus. ya gonna talk feminine penis? Well, that's true. Also, Europe still bad comparison because, again, country Europe came close getting zero months like countries listed. predicted… link? 3-mil COVID. VJ tentacles? Every single medical reservist guardsman know already working civilian healthcare trained capacity. may medical technicians different careers, anyone more-than-AIT-training (nurses higher) already involved fight. 

Activating guard/reserve robbing Peter pay Paul.

There's also already agreements AD hospitals surrounding civilian hospitals. One buddies last deployment split time on-base work work local civilian hospitals keep skills sharp - base clinics see trauma like civilian ER will. 😂 posted now? bodily autonomy also apply vaccines general? someone give bodily autonomy go things like public schools? think people mentality underestimating long-term effects actually contracting COVID, *also* studied extensively. reports show permanent lung heart damage, increased risk stroke, neurological problems, etc. 

I’m afraid *do know* “long haul COVID” don’t know potential vaccine side effects might even exist. Meanwhile 2 people got fined going walking hot beverage.

Why surprised? understanding native Chinese renal failure well-known associated SARS quick search associated MERS. also remember journal submissions last summer exploring this. lockdown.

ah yes, lockdown CeX various coffee places open

it's lockdown, mild request...which many complying sorry lockdown get hard enough welding people homes works you.

well went 0-60 real quick. 👍🏼 I'm hotspot. drive miles away shop. remember correctly /r/Seoul South Korean government covid cases trying negotiate price down. caused issue started seeing spike cases lock again. need vaccine, since didn’t lock orders little harder get it. /u/NateSoma probably knows lot though. need ability control future pandemics. allows that.

Temporary law. Ends September.   Keyword: Fanatics.

I'm Christian, think God gave us science reason. following guidelines, ""holy people"" could literally killing others.

When watching Capitol Raid happen, saw flag Jesus it. exact opposite real Christianity. I'm worried potential believers see distorted beliefs, they'll assume religion straight-up bad, think that's religion unfortunately becoming less 'relevant'.

I want call atheists agnostics bad, faith saw saw I'd probably really skeptical religion too. Try posting good news... gets voted immediately. Everyone wants wallow. Source? saw reported 78%. Im Floridian cystic fibrosis idea get vaccine, odd see spent much time hospitalised patients.  know anecdotal, friend got heart test signs inflammation second heart test done months later, inflammation gone. He’s back training now. still big move Swedish gov't, right one make. need ability control future pandemics. allows that. Truth is- theyre trending toward gov't control less. Still model success means, though countries claim that. Truth really know. theories. someone else pointed out, asymptomatic spread unusual might one cause. could also something virus binds human cells. new ""variants"" virus said contagious original strain, suggesting something virus determines contagious is.

Also previous viruses like SARS H1N1 thought spread airborne. Scientists really sure Covid spread airborne not, read says virus seem ""season"" like flu, transmission really slow warm weather months like flu.

I think virus studied years come try figure different viruses. vaguely recall kid always someone swore cousin’s cousin’s best friend got reinfected chickenpox. lockdown sensible people like you, people like normal plentiful. It’s moneyless ego rush guy gets leading people. That’s real addiction can’t give saw report morning, couple 80s spending quite bit money get centre taxi. parents sent one hopefully get everyone cars / lifts available. big scheme things China quite long time ago deserve 52 downvotes. community claims care much mental health wellbeing, right tell someone interpret current restrictions. meet newborn nephew first time facetime, felt pretty shit. Florida still covering cases though? I'm aware many diseases one expect suffer symptoms 6+ months diagnosis--especially one positive prognosis. unforgivable fucking stupid alleged ""humans"" are. Still getting downvotes single argument vaccines effective new variants. 20 somethings exposed long ago. them, unequivocally less deadly flu. California 20 somethings got summer, California would closer herd immunity far less vectors. would saved lives. Firstly, Church disappear months years restrictions. Church institution thousands years old bigger one particular building congregation.

Secondly, something important beneficial without *always* necessary. People need running water stay alive either, still important helpful society.

As far tell, Christian justification keeping normal church services going pandemic church attendance spiritual tool, mandate, case attendance contradicts mandates loving other, submitting governing authority, many others.

Then again, would consider many Christian churches first place, regardless call themselves.   Boca week October people wear masks public buildings, beach would see groups 20+ people playing beer pong flip cup sharing reusing cups. Pretty sure everyone group got covid case all. things people get hospitalized recover weeks. 

There plenty evidence long term effects quite lot people. 75% would much bigger number previously estimated, mean theory people go hospital months problems true.

The average length hospital stay US 4.6 days. people feel bad months later that.  20s-40s people know got covid major complications, would trust outside ""experts"" decrying world ending crisis look experiences around go, ""I see big deal"".

Apparently depends live peer pressure social circle. friends whose young-adult kids friends avoiding unnecessary contact, others area partying causing dangerous covid surge. 

North South Dakota two ten worst states terms covid deaths per million. guess people 50 considered important there. total money actually gets services needy? don’t count millions toward facilities big clubhouse congregation enjoy real charity. also don’t count 100 billon plus mormons sit dribbling 1 2 percent annual new contributions actual charity need.

Unless prove China making biological weapon something going prove anything matters magically going stop pandemics like research origins.

Anytime disease pops infectious common cold like symptoms capacity asymptomatic people carry it, pandemic. country system rapidly stopping virus like that.

During large wave, North Dakota tested 25% population (unique individuals) average 2 times. positivity rate unique tests never exceeded 18.5%. That's maximum. wave period approximately 80,000 people tested positive. number 7.2x higher, would 576,000 cases accounted for. Given 18.5% maximum positivity rate, would need minimum population size 3.1 million people, exceeding population state 2.3 million. Again, minimum again, 25% state tested average twice wave period. 

Not mention, ongoing serology study North Dakota shows 10.7% state antibodies SARS-CoV-2. (scroll serology testing) Compare Manaus Brazil seroprevalence 44-66% September still experienced another wave cases 76% seroprevalence December. 

In words, there's herd immunity here. mathematical impossibility, supported serological testing data, simply defies common sense. was, however, 18% decline mobility cases rose.

Do it. Everyone go stores get food. Nobody said anything 100% certain catching it. said it’s less 100% chance one likely get covid, logical compare directly, long term effect vaccine vs long term effect covid factor assess whether get vaccine. 

Let explain terms equation:

Chance getting long term covid complication = (chance getting covid) x (chance long term complications covid)

Chance getting long term vaccine complication = 100% x (chance getting long term vaccine complication)

You see two variables first equation one second (since chance getting vaccine get vaccinated 100%) That’s point I’m making, it’s illogical compare two long term risk variables one variables involved calculating covid risk. Nobody knows exact values variables certain, certainly assign personal values make pseudo calculations. keep saying single vaccine ever randomly long term effects zero short term ones. makes sense given mechanism actions vaccines historically.

You can’t claim something /could/ happen without zero basis it, either theoretically biologically kind previous examole Wait what? quite bizarre think people filming non-clinical areas hospital surprised lack people milling about.
What expect? Someone ventilator reception desk car park?!

As someone worked nights on-call, assure everyone hospitals really quiet pretty much every night, except perhaps ED/A&amp;E. others wanting live appears. United States don’t even wait. you’ve got star flag, let it. anything. voter, people may taking issue saying willing locked care others. Yes. outdoor concert venues. built heavy traffic large numbers. Japanese government requested immigrants quarantined two weeks. Brazil allow leave country? due Japan? think Japan criticized countries generated COVIDs countries allowed COVID-positive people leave country? Great, know can't expect anyone entire state responsible. Good idea imagine still believing bs made crazy ppl 1800 years ago developed world SHIT WANNA SEE, IVE SAYING LETS GOOOOO Lol..Mexico never denined Swine flu, neither hide evidences lied infectiousness virus China did. Also Mexico never deleted/burned/removed research investigations associated Virus...as China did. think world brainwashed ....I see brainwashed. brainwashed never see brainwashed. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Shouldn’t spread misinformation like without facts back up.   closed?? south stopped packed since April Transmission symptoms occur little 10 viral particulates (this evidenced CDC studies). Evidence suggests vaccines slow spread greatly reduce mortality. We're going endemic Sars2. True herd immunity pipe dream. r/ConfidentlyIncorrect call anything happening North Dakota ""intervention"" yes. people moving right around restrictions. Contact tracing/genetic analysis... Im pretty sure America given I'm trace 98% transmissions. businesses fined it. Lock psycho They’ve already trimmed OC plans way hopefully question doesnt get political response, but, feel like completely fair reject socialized healthcare country big America. wait times would astronomical. whether cheaper expensive, id rather private healthcare able get care want want wait long periods time see specific specialist dr want see. Ireland UK way worse are. How? Dying much cheaper medical care? make sense mutations using six distinct categories. first common type substitution. go, example, G somehow ends instead. Unlike RNA viruses, human coronaviruses come equipped corrective machinery normally fix substitutions. so-called proofreading mechanism SARS-CoV-2 thus far yielded rate error much lower RNA viruses like HIV influenza. virus lacks capacity variation, makes large number people infects—meaning variant catch on, spread like second type deletion. Deletions occur polymerase skips, leaving gap genetic code. nasty thing deletions virus cannot correct retroactively. Though likely disrupt function substitution, capable killing virus altogether, deletions, small large, still allow virus grow. mutations sort advantageous virus—and concern us—alter virus significant kinds deletions exist—in frame, frame. long deletions appear multiples three, remain frame, unobtrusive protein whole. However, deletions occur singly doubly—out frame—disrupt entire protein, unlike misplaced letter run-on sentence causes reader stop third type insertion, mutation observed occasionally amongst hundreds thousands genomic sequences stored GISAID, open-access sequence repository. Insertions describe extra bits genetic information, whether it’s one nucleotide entire segment, end given genome fourth type inversion, happens segment genome flipped head, reversing order polymerase stutters spits bit information again, duplicate created—hence fifth type, sixth final type recombination. Literally, parts two separate viruses become conjoined. two different viral genomes find cell, bits pieces shuffle one other, unwittingly settling new forms process. way SARS-CoV-2 produces proteins encourages recombination. Even region crucial protein could existing literature coronaviruses already tells us recombine, least bats. fact, process likely SARS-CoV-2 came born, possibly ant-eating mammals known pangolins. unpublished reports recombination among SARS-CoV-2 variants occurs. dense crowd, one person might infected simultaneously two different people, reinfected subgenomic remnants first infection still linger system. SARS-CoV-2 also infect animals live closely us, recombination events combining SARS-CoV-2 animal genes might also occur, changing virus unknown possibly dangerous high prevalence SARS-CoV-2 cold-causing viruses time, suspect events either already occurred inevitably ill. first glance, none mutations, taken isolation, would appear capable kickstarting new variant disease. Calculated conceived scale, however, swarming certainly startling impression begins substitution. average, viral genome 30,000 units long, substitution alters one unit every 10,000. can’t say sure many viruses teeming moment within one person infected Covid-19, know every milliliter contagious nasal fluid contains something like 10^8 (one hundred million) 10^9 (one billion) viral billion viruses, per one per 10,000 average, means three billion substitutions—and that’s one drop mucus. Multiply actual volume active virus single body, number active Covid-19 infections given populace, long you’ll find well quintillions. words, mutations give way viral variation happening time rates nearly inconceivable. lot events 100% outdoors. Everything I've seen said vaccine prevents sickness, necessarily transmission. 

That's primarily trials focused measuring effect vaccine people getting sick. completed studies impact transmission, medical experts erring side caution telling people assume reduction transmission.

However, would surprised vaccine impact transmission all. vaccine effective preventing illness, leaves people contagious would without vaccine would strange. honestly understand spousal transmission low. Spouses literally sleep bed exchange respiratory droplets (aka kissing) shit headline. Since Dec 13, North Dakota reported deaths Sundays. 7-day moving average deaths 6 right now, 300+ equivalent deaths CA. wonder kid Wyoming. Kids usually rebel know.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah could start anywhere didn’t lol swine flu didn’t fuck world two years In-n-Out Burger states. People line hours get it, even anti-vax idiots. think we're seeing right anyways virus less run course current amount potential hosts combined vaccination effort, beginning form better picture.

Yes assume well, vaccination + careless people infected + rest simply careful takes toll virus!

Congratulations Europe, dont let guard another while! People downvoting me, tell alternative please. Everyone know comes work knowingly sick paid sick days living paycheque paycheque is. joke fucking tired worse live lost people Covid. forgot add: entire congregation That's based model. Serological antibody testing North Dakota says otherwise. problem model uses factor serological surveys conducted early pandemic without taking anything like population density account. 

Mathematically, simply cannot 3x positivity rate would exceed population state. that's using peak positivity rate applying entire outbreak. decrease positivity rate increases number test subjects needed. Yeah 80% correct, 100%. Like another Redditor said, 2022 realistic. people vaccinated dad’s 80 heart problems still can’t get appointment. wait 3 years, make sure everything clear stick regular schedule afterwards?  get vaccine questions properly answered becomes readily accessible. lot questions confusion issue, one seems good credible sources information help make decision. mean know anything companies manufacturing it. know differences ones they're testing work. even know mRNA is. However, seeing people medical field hesitant concerning leaves alot confusion people like me. am. Read on, want know personal reasons stand.

 time, hesitant due unknowns others mentioned, addition simply decently afraid suffer GAD, anemia, CFS, seemingly become prone infections within body towards end 2020. (I total 3 different types past 5 months). None serious, alarming sudden increase despite leaving house working half time period. infections gone except one I'm currently dealing with. 

As fear, bit anxiety disorder relating issues less unknown. I'm afraid needles use clinical trial patient quite studies years ago. However, struggle take new medications recommended, even new higher dose, I'll inevitably fall anxiety attack causes get angina one long enough. concerning heart slight arrhythmia given long list family history many heart health issues especially immediate family, cannot afford take risk lightly. past September, ended nearly go urgent care heart would stop squeezing/spasming irregularly chest half hour. eventually return normal went anyways get checked (I'm uninsured), felt inclined take wait see approach. happened since day. 

 beginning past year, admit adamantly getting simply believed young, decent enough health, therefore need get it. downplay could get flu. simply looked numbers went statistics. get regular flu shots last 14 years. I'm opposed people getting Anti-Vax way, simply want know diving putting substance body given I've listed above. 

 yes, maybe even bit paranoia play believe media always honest general public. I'm never gonna change mind that. honest feelings without fear-mongering using pseudo-science ""prove point"". addition moderate distrust higher end pharmaceutical industry American government shady dealings, still have, even I'm taking time think accurate information available me. mom got sick (her covid test inconclusive) ending ER, made reconsider stance I'm looking information make better informed decision get vaccine time. sure best option they're accessible everyone. 


TLDR; confused, afraid, questions, health related issues. sure vaccine best even I'm good candidate despite health issues. grandpa driving van nursing home producing $10M economic output? No, that's rich people. restrictions, likely districts There's nothing statewide could've done unless something united *nationally*. Even California 40% Republicans. even Trump thing, though help. US short-sighted pro-business ways done kind extended national lockdown required actually stamp COVID. Also, Spanish Flu started close WWI. basically, 100 years ago, fought another world-war level pandemic. vaccinating then? People know? Thanks mate.

I'm big fan learning behavioural economics human decision making (driven personalities experiences) irrational, rational believed traditional economics.

Behaviour fascinating brains work way generally advantageous think way upon time.

So presented different opinion mine, try determine truth. care less right knowing truth.

My opinions ultimately drive children experiences, think important know true.

All said, one favourite articles, thank job IOC? IOC disappearing party's guest list issue? think liked get attention middle expensive party venues. announce cancellation Olympics, problems solved. Oof, that's discouraging. think it’s spelled boreder also like part assign lower value Italians. check math confirm. People still going work... could also backfire people want get vaccine doubt second dose available on-schedule. Epidemiological analysis put IFR less 0.7% official death count ~372k (and actual number likely [30-40% means absolute minimum 53M infections 16%.

I think Youyang Gu cautious refuses use excess deaths data. that's case, [91M infections estimate probably closer reality. point doesn’t work way. notice, positive correlation accross Canada cases CT values: Yup, imagine much reluctant people get vaccination lose confidence government's ability ensure timely access second dose.

I one sure hell getting vaccine feel confident second dose administered prescribed schedule. “Researchers found 76 per cent discharged one hospital Wuhan, city centre outbreak, still showed least one symptom associated disease six months later. 

Fatigue sleep difficulties, occurred 63 per cent 26 per cent patients respectively, common problems. 

To surprise researchers, third patients showed signs kidney malfunction, led problems increase bodily waste blood increased risk sexual dysfunction.
Read feel like already case 😅 one society, even best leaders world except centenerians still living experienced something like magnitude pandemic wise, even one experience call economy industries affected this. Similarly grandparents tell us stories war fought hid bombs, feel we, old frail tell kids' kids tales stay inside weeks end world fights virus tired hearing NYC did. think comparable.

Yeah I'm sure indeed sick hearing example blows whole argument up

In 1947, NYC started mass vaccination program overnight got 6 million people vaccinated 3 weeks.

Over 70 years later, NYC started vaccinating people multiple months notice. got 520k doses delivered city, three weeks vaccinated 200k.

What stops using least half doses today exactly? forgotten vaccinate people since mid-century, point vaccinate 10 times less people? can't provide reason, glib dismissal example find single one next two weeks, either. guarantee that.

I certainly hope not, states seem finally start addressing poor rollout, hopefully correct linked article says they’ll finish first doses Jan 25 I’ve never paid much attention Florida, seeing governor reacted virus I’ve decided 0 interest ever visiting state. fucking degenerate life worth $10M life insurance profitable? pay $1M pocket $9M? Thats weird wrong way look ok. need chill. I've never unplanned pregnancy. stereotypes make seen really insecure unhinged.  nobody pays though essentially free. people can't afford pay relative's death. Tier approach fine burden proof receiver. make announcement saying X date we’re receiving people healthcare, grocery stores, teachers, etc. would provide proof employment arrive register online something. ISE US EXAMPLE. Without getting details let sink in: governor mandated masks fist time NOVEMBER. 2020. Well, competent leadership would helped. Plus know n95s actually really block virus. maybe would..and Covid fatigue bad 6 months ago. 4 weeks Covid could levels Australia. serious contact tracing quarantining. Great points. kiss ass I'm gonna need build mod PITA EHR improve metrics believe Florida 25th per capita deaths. bad considering everything open. honest question, free ensuring people going get second dose right time?

I see many people advocating states start giving vaccines anyone wants speed things up, seems pretty clear needing two injections within time frame makes utterly unrealistic. boring friend? we're states. Small businesses going rapid rate government imposed lock downs, mostly state government mandating. big box stores running full capacity. Walmart, Target, home improvement stores open operating raking big bucks. Fast food chains thriving thru drive thru services, chains indoor dining spacing tables. Yet little grocer mom pop joints told shut doors. 

Someone said 1% that's fueling lock downs right. Name one big box store actually stood little guy. one spoken know why. problem. ones benefiting lock downs. competitors gone. 

Now need look politicians lobbyist big box stores. bet thry holding hands. Democrat run states worst far imposing lot unnecessary lock downs. Except half population would refuse wear :/ need medical staff right badly, making point worth risking people's lives ICUs become understaffed Well, huge surge reinfections far I've heard we're 10 months point, seems immunity definitely permanent, getting infected seems give immunity people. People fearmongering reinfection since beginning pandemic, still remains rare(especially considering claims reinfection likely cases someone never fully getting virus virus suddenly causing symptoms again) somebody looking forward vaccine, great. someone getting whatever reason, great. People reasons getting it, like people reasons getting it. valid. end. Wonder conspiracy theories rampant. Maybe politicians want crisis go satisfy thirst power? 


You would think vaccines would priority #1 Summer. article says, idk they're reading! I'm taking total number people positive entire period time. I'm looking single day. I'm taking cases tested positive midway August today multiplying 3x factor. maximum positive day 18.5% I'm applying entire time period.

If 18.5% tests positive everyday mid-August now, virtually everyone would infected Coronavirus Resource Center’s current approach calculating positivity throughout site Approach 4, following reasons:""  4 ""The number people test positive divided either **unique** people, encounters, tests""

So unique tests could people taking multiple tests factoring numbers. old deaths 🧐 I’m far Ontario thing happening neighborhood. Parties every weekend hear. data yet.

But assure Saturday way better last Saturday.

I realize talking first shots shots. Shut electricity gas. Seems simple enough.  Every year nation gets new flu vaccine. don’t know hard. Spread word, virus man really said Daytona 500 National super spreader event☠️ mRNA unstable begin although stabilized vaccines, point cells around days disintegrates. months certainly years - days. There's really nothing vaccines (and vaccines general) sticks around long-term, since definitely established vaccines *not* like therapeutic drugs taken regularly given period recovery, really understand general fear long-term side effects vaccines. started Christmas. tens thousands facilities. finished date article. 2 weeks now: Calgary Pastor says God lrt die vontracting COVID. 

10 days later: Calgary Pastor broke local COVID rules dies COVID. 

 heard hear first all. Happens like nearly every time. guy blurred legal definition cherry pie? want make profitable need go Western large cities already stadiums place demand brand spanking new everything.

A place like Chicago already everything place could host Olympics building new apartment complex probably desperately needed anyways.

But instead choose Rio builds bunch stuff plan use it.

Stay away authoritarian regimes willing dump truckloads money prestige IOC would better off. ran people kill? It’s shitshow cvs. Cvs always devil. many yesterday (Saturday)?  think fair count M-F ignore weekends.

Anyway, 700k still closer 500k 1M. Yes, know different person made claim. please stop bullshit conjecture of, ""unreported cases"", rampant, ""asymptomatics""? actual evidence supporting been, despite nonsense circulating months.  


People want true, keeps coming up. sarcastic, aware they're tied 4th deaths per capita? Actually important stuff usually rational people seek information for. really devolved much species need nanny state hold hands everything? mean, education understand grown people think going spoon fed encyclopedic knowledge palm hands. 

Physicians writing Facebook posts Twitter threads stuff forgot Google Gates forced make Edge default browser mind control powers. Yes, that's true. And, -20 F. gale force blizzard face so. Spread word. right. I'm calling lack political will. US person would assume deeply self-hating addicted drama. much thought autism related this. Infection vaccine cause it. 

My SIL advised get vaccine she’s due March. worries she’s doctor would assume knows 21 imported 48 domestic transmissions. Wishful thinking sort? mean, would nice *if* something we've already got shelf would help.

I think lot people familiar veterinary uses saw articles double-take -- know also drug humans that's attention-getter. Eh, I'll take government actually governing 1,000 deaths rather living country 380,000 died. (Assuming US) They’re ones dying I’m one kids school needs work every day. sit house indefinitely, regardless, aren’t getting either. health department freezer adequately protected right it’s ridiculous. WTF happened army standing ready distribute?!?

I mean believe him, questioned We’re to. Wait find 6 months ago government could sent 10 n95 masks every man woman child cost 15 billion. Instead trillions used prop economies. really wish could appreciate stupid sound everyone else. still mutating slowly. difference lot instances occuring lot hosts there. stopped coup? reason think North Dakota distributed 30,000 that’s nothing! can’t see harder distribute vaccine 40 million people 700,000? Yea percentage basis ND better whoop. point saying let’s hold back patting. ND much easier job CA TX FL NY pretty much every state fact. West Virginia awesome. would go 3 called get shot.  Leverage jury duty system send paper mailers. day call number learn report vaccine administration. someone explain anti parasitic would work Covid? oddly intriguing Well person replied lamented rich getting first, presumably talking period time people vaccine far. I'm pushing back saying: means less people spread disease. saying think necessarily true. Well register, might assume want vaccine. people want list, signing up, they're different list, government would know vaccinated omission. So, point worrying. can't tell government create registry people want vaccine. live ND attest. Almost every person I’ve come contact gotten it. Also, one cares COVID here. It’s actually insane. interesting demoralizing Thanks input, vaccine ultimately opt for? Sign *that* hand sanitizer woohoo! I'll bedding every hawt resident facility!! I'm sorry hear it! hope mom hangs gets shot soon. Like said, stage 4 stabilized. Communication college professors non-existent states. teaching F2F damn well deserve one. College campuses petri dish.  government's terribly inefficient someone's making money every turn.  Makes sense though. Kids going remote teachers in-person classes ones dont give rats ass vaccine covid general. 
So theyre wasting time teachers continue teach online get vaccine high risk individuals people 65-75, also highly susceptible virus wait 12 weeks(thats Cuomo’s words) get steady increase supply. 

However, bottleneck. Nurses doctors saying vaccine delaying deployment caught hospitals surplus know with.

The problem isnt vaccines. problem Cuomo’s plan, need finish group 1a jump group 1b couldve combined. 

30% vaccines administered slow so. healthcare workers/nursing staff/residents didnt want it. It’s clusterfuck. Work starve. people understand countries without safety nets choice? blame them? know wrong better know right. I've heard lot optimistic stuff virus day one, almost without exception, pessimistic case closer truth. comment originally replied mocking someone recalled study mentioning 25% cases leading degree permanent lung damage. think falls totally within realm possibility. going ignore fact medical professionals trust well least fucking ASK hesitant get it? mean come fuck people get finger blown whatever yee yee ass shit y’all do, people take care go ER. yet y’all fucking AUDACITY write possible ISSUE instead ASKING people MEDICALLY TRAINED don’t want get it? 
In conclusion, opinion actual vaccine idgaf get ffs bring back logic reason discussions instead writing people different opinion? Y’all fucking similar people condemn day long look mirror 

im done Take look [this summarizes financial report University Oxford Tokyo 2020's Olympic budget.

They've *already spent* $12.6~15.84 *billion* USD, projected spend much twice actually hold event. Talk [sunk one hand, sounds almost likely hosting event break bank, plan recoup losses (as much possible) ticket sales, sponsorship deals etc. think ever planned make *profit* games, host minimal loss.

I think also holding nostalgia 1964 Olympics, led direct investment Tokyo's infrastructure followed economic boom: government believes revive magic.

Note: point defend holding games prop economy actually good idea, illustrate thinking everyone I've spoken Japan uses justify holding games prop economy. California used less third supply. North Dakota used two thirds. Stop making complicated. I'm sure thought made sense compare one least populated states one populated states first place. believe CNN CDC? 

No. actually one case severe COVID vaccine group, can't remember pfizer moderna. deaths, though.  


Others symptomatic covid considerably fewer control group, hence 95% efficacy. experimental group part clinical trials, though. expect real world efficacy lower due screw ups certainly happening transport, storage, proper preparation prior injection, etc. yes no.  Obviously, total amount money huge, total tech sum huge....but poor tech deficient ways matter regards particular issue.  I'm expert, think one things falls category Repubilcans scared/skeptical government Well...if virus longer cause disease cares spreads not? ever suggested vaccinating poor? Yeah...and one two articles examines primates neither examines Covid vaccine, specifically. people probably get vaccine anyway first dose phone worked great older model android. I'm getting 5G even tho capable battery life improved significantly. addition, $2400 deposited bank account Feds mortgage came due month $15k owed back payments sent back loan. like knew exactly needed money pay bills. Incredible. 

When get second dose I'm buying lottery ticket pool backyard would really improve productivity work cardio would reduce risk cardiovascular disease thus lowering premiums employer pay insurance. also join gym. Yeah. Maybe take running. productive. work. That’s county doing. Call want vaccine list go priority tiers kind like free all...more vaccines per hour distributed physician works healthcare employees looked stuff internet decided skip vaccine ""based research"", disheartened seeing among supposedly educated people claim care patients.

If graduated degree healthcare, able basic risk assessment - comparing risk harm vaccine (while ""zero"", minimal) risk harm society risk *should fail achieve herd immunity*.

If basic assessment actually reading understanding information vaccine, right answer (with exception contraindication, course) get damn vaccine. awful think Frontline workers state covid deniers. Heartbreaking. say travel? public listen either way. don’t vaccinate anyone unless ask themselves. really highest finally reported correctly? *Checks*, yep. 2 weeks since Christmas. Israel tiny country population land area huge supply vaccine national healthcare system. I’m sick hearing it, “model” based reality US.

For example, national database US use tracking. even want one, would take long time develop one. forget it....if national healthcare system we’d way better time start work would years ago. Sure, Jan. everyone assume one done thing? virus like chicken pox pretty much immune rest life? get around 2 3 months protection, vulnerable virus? 278,920 record anyone wanting click article. likely pfizer moderna vaccines work covid 19 variants years, getting marginally less effective time. States barely distribute current supplies. can't imagine progress improve available doses distributed. Well 50% population it, assume roughly another 10% isolating rarely going out. could hitting ""herd immunity"" threshold. 

However think what's happen decent portion population isolating basically non-existent potential hosts pool. Meanwhile virus running rest potential hosts still available reached point running people antibodies infected it.  


However past weeks winter break colleges testing well underwhelming number people. I'm expecting rise towards end month, could also wrong. 700k first doses administered friday.

I would highly surprised fewer 50k second doses were. anything like travel order we've Chicago since last summer, won't, businesses will. said staff.. subtly trying tell ""that person"". comment reeks dingbat superiority complex that's rampant IT. people care least virus don’t believe likely ones get least likely ones get tested. Also know cases one person household got tested multiple people Covid, also underrepresented case count. probably well. probably 100 different things. feel really bad Japan, must invested much it. closing ceremony Rio fantastic. Doraemon Super Mario everything! Oh.. :( People UK fully ignore outdoor transmission. much empathy healthcare workers...people part. can’t blame government since voted in... Wrong. happens culture promotes seeking individualist pleasure anything else society.

These people hate idea putting community themselves, stupid understand concepts civic duty, would thing COVID 10 15 times deadly is.

These kinds people scared making even minor sacrifice greater good, disgusting.

""Dat's like fascism, ayo"". Stupidity. Doctor cost- benefit analysis.

I wonder much lockdown cost personally? Thank much detailed explanation. Didn’t know thanks. critique content article? So. 2021 copy paste 2020, rate. travelling everything closed. Cool. Especially people like live big cities. Yes, many flu infections also asymptomatic. think stay inside forever name safety. repost actual title likely stealing asset civilian hospital using asset

Definitely. also complicated even decisive enough mobilize guard reserve unit type mission. Many PA's physicians already practicing respective hospitals. 

However... would gladly take activation heartbeat means able help needed. math herd immunity work North Dakota... working less dense population. Strain variant things. Difference Virus Strain Variant: It’s administered directly uptake thought occur though. It’s simply “easy way.” follows research could prove distinctly effective.  lot throat singing people definitely keep far enough away can't catch anything...so ya, works. fuuuug.... july? seriously? study bother link take word even exists.   reason call nurses idiots. wonderful nurses around world. idiots doctors though. min. wage workers better critical thinking skills nurses. like rhetoric highest status jobs deemed idiots. guess makes sense...after all, people Covid another flu [/s] considered implementing lockdown widespread transmission country surrounded water might slightly different circumstances? nurses telling wear mask, feel free ignore that. domain expertise virology.

But actual doctors, importantly, health scientists actually research found mask reduces infection rate something like 60%. Ya, need get back habit...

I used boil water every night leave covered stainless steel pot use next day evening. Got habit moved three years ago used tap every since.

The risk anything bad clearly small, still unnecessary risk. Thats interesting counter point, although feel significant percentage &lt;80 getting ICU care. thing remember infant mortality etc really skewed life expectancy lower. 1919 life expectancy 53 men US 56 women. LOT people could still expect live til late 60s, early 70s. unexpected hear Toronto Sun Note Toronto Sun considered absolute joke Toronto really people organizing. Host cities lot heavy lifting. officer Alberta Health Services said inspection found two approximately 75 attendees wearing masks, pastor church staff unmasked rows auditorium full, people sitting side-by-side rows less two metres apart. inspection also found cleaning disinfecting high-touch surfaces officer issued following orders church verbally Monday, written order Tuesday. staff attendees wear church calculate allowed capacity public health restrictions, exceed 15 per cent fire code capacity. physical distancing signage instructing showing

Any bets long hear outbreak traced church? 

2 weeks? Maybe little longer? Bloody fanatics Honestly I’ll get vaccine, think it’s fair people want get due lack data long term effects obv haven’t studied  literally always stance might flu, stay home. many people. Knowingly possibly infecting people huge dick move certain individuals power don’t like pass things like mandatory sick leave many people faced tough choice. 

But yes, sick flu, going visit family members makes dick head. think less logistics giving winter Olympics bigger stage.


Because overwhelming majority Olympics done host city. Strain variant things. Difference Virus Strain Variant: California one lowest hospital beds per capita country. Strain variant things. Difference Virus Strain Variant: ND definitely bodies infect. state's seven-day new-case average ranked second nation Saturday. Arizona last week ranked first three days row Friday got cia van follows around new friend dresses black. name Kay, he's swell dude.  interesting read. Thank sharing. undercount cases 3x could hovering close around 50% - quite herd immunity level enough start cutting spread quite bit.

I think assume 3x rate. might valid densely populated areas, unlikely apply North Dakota. wave ND, 25% population PCR tested average twice. hard argument make 3x infected would ~241,000 infected wave alone. Given positivity rate peaked 16.03% wave, need tested 1.5 million unique individuals wave, twice population North Dakota (which 762k people). math work out. _entirely_ there. pretty much one swine flu vaccines caused narcolepsy. dead virus type vaccine one shell proteins resembled protein regulates sleep.

Of course, actually catching swine flu likely cause narcolepsy getting vaccine shell comes virus. vaccine still taken market swine flu disappearing likelihood catching dwindled longer worth it. Preach on! Lockdows bad! I'm sure speculations equal Lancet study. easy way administer clinical strength antiviral. miracle cure like implying. going apply logic flu future? Death rate may lower, still kill people. feel guilty got flu spread someone end dying? Hmm... 2.839 mil 2018. deaths causes went down? expect 2.8 3 last year 150k people die stuff? likely get reset 21 January. Trump simply can't bothered coronavirus issues time now, Biden step 21 promises make vaccination priority. Mostly lack testing, health authorities said mass testing pointless. mean, 20 minutes headline referring long takes individual get through.

In article, show numbers people observation area (100) administered vaccine(32), throughput person jabbing higher every 20 minutes. Yeah sure. That's another huge factor reducing seriousness. Hell happened 10 years ago would WAY worse. Something? Thanks, helpful. Looks like done homework.

I'm glad took it, must feeling much safer now. think wise decision, even susceptible. Im working healthcare, training scientist, running covid samples seeing many positive. took vaccine, fought get actually. Took 3 weeks bc shit hot mess organized. Minimal side effects, slight muscle fatigue hour got it, may bc sleep much night bc another nightmare caught cdu wo ppe. cant wait second shot. Il happy know really almost over. say open everything back think North Dakota quite reached herd immunity yet, North Dakota relatively good testing per capita, cases started declining days governor issued statewide mask mandate(way late!). Another example “what virus?” attitude here. People wear masks that’s line drawn. Literally nothing else changed. govt ashamed. exactly. painful data know vaccines already knew halfway phase 2 trials months months ago. process needs revamped. 

No double blind placebo bullshit. someone wants vaccine phase 2, let part separate study. Regulate vaccine manufacturers provide ""open beta"" structure order get approval fast tracking. 

Imagine collapse hope economies get new strain affected vaccine. slow, careful really need be. Even 1 100,000 people getting something horrible vaccine nothing compared damage lack vaccine caused.  agree. People listening doctors getting annoying ( already annoying) agree him. Get rid tiers set drive thrus get people vaccinated.

You completely ignorant. fine. Ask plastic surgery sub (I know septo isn’t really plastic surgery, good info there) 66 million 2021? Fat fucking chance. type authoritarian control unapologetically rejected. 10-15% hospitalized. big, big majority would died then. Rite Aid focusing wellness, carrying natural products like sleep remedies essential oils.

COVID infectious widespread refusing vaccine essentially choosing eventually catch COVID. light makes even less sense worried ""long term effects."" fascist mean something bad you? really. shipped box. takes hours drive across North Dakota.

The biggest problem last mile. people taking vaccines boxes putting people. understand

right? place went moderna vaccine cranking weekend. one many sites city 2 million so.

The formula there, everyone needs it. line saw vaccines reminded testing lines before, except time moved quicker. Everyone get there, takes time. realistic assume everyone automatically go super efficient mode once.

My worry new strain coming renders work mostly useless. that, seeing possible I'm optimistic. Especially considering much fucking tax pay superior state health agencies. argument 3x population easily countered advances acceptance germ theory.

No can't. like .05% die zero medical intervention 55 almost everyone 55 1918. FINALLY! Wonder Murphy follow Cuomo.. What's issue that? means visitors Yosemite covid, mean isolated.  way easier distribute vaccine 5 hospitals 50. 

I know that's political. know else living? Knowingly spreading virus wearing mask much ask. 

What hyperbole thinking people want wear one time reason? Maybe, modern medicine reason population old first place. Transport virus back 1918 blip percentage population 80 extremely low compared modern times specifically advancements medical technology. forgot /s Good thing doctor friends. traditional vaccines, yes, mRNA vaccines unknown. 

Im anti- mRNA vaccines likelyhood they’re safe, think people right control put body. Weddings, birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years...the usual. People stopped caring think they're safe ""it happen me."" know everyone lives alone, right? Would virus eliminated large household 21 day lockdown? Let's say family one grandparent, two parents two teenagers living together. Suppose one parents infected picking supplies lockdown.

How many people fail prepare properly supplies would end dangerously malnourished? Six months recover respiratory infection way worse vaccine reaction I've ever (and I've notoriously ""rough"" vaccines there.) much alive well, contrary certain Ruski oligarch would like believe. it’s gone unfortunately push 2022 winter summer year Okay, unjustified hesitancy kills someone who's right thing I'm sure lose drop sleep people fundamentally selfish. Nope. said that. Oh good point, sure could ask people administering quick hi bye. North Dakotan here, worst state nation time worst world. governor issued mask mandate November, helped curve actually started flattening days mandate shown effects. suspect partial herd immunity help sharp drop cases, Covid rampant everybody careless (and LOT people) already caught virus recovered it. 

That theory backed data South Dakota, curve similarly bad flattened time, without mask mandate. curve flattened much slowly however, compare two states see proof herd immunity flatten curve, herd immunity plus mask mandate flatten much effectively. Skepticism healthy actually

[Sunny Care helpful free checklists email you, Loss Checklist. also pay help things overwhelmed.

It might take time consider reading “grief” books, Megan Devine’s **It’s OK You’re OK** really understands emotions involved. prefer research-based approach, [The Side George Bonanno, head Columbia University's [Loss, Trauma Emotion uses cross-cultural comparisons talk science resiliency.

And anyone dealing grief incredibly stressful time - get better. might feel like right now, survive this. Connect online communities remember, **you're alone**. side effects vaccine present months, year. reset till February, people know gotten second shot. Perhaps, ND also good testing compared states cases registered, decline new cases came several days ND's governor issued statewide mask mandate. one hand, govt stay personal health choices allowed decide businesses succeed fail. hand, people allowed hurt people, right? Even young person get symptoms, pass along everyone else community. 

IMO, grossly simplifies debate harm caused current approach, also dismisses argument morality. I've thought long hard increasingly become sympathetic critics stance, different angle.

Like said, government really allowed decide fails succeeds subsequently lives important lives. emergency case must decided power public good, there's moral obligation also good faith make things whole getting lives destroyed fault own. Instead, actively observing governments power actively choosing whole sectors destroy also leaving high dry. prioritized one's life someone else's. Think businesses real people whose lives invested absolutely destroyed may never recover from. I'd make argument least bad outcome infected, even worse actively decided government people zero control over. 

Ideally, could shut highest risk activities accordance science data full transparency. clearly done (e.g. outdoor dining shut riskier businesses get arbitrary ""essential"" designation thus remain unchecked despite proven widespread transmission, ICU capacity zero weeks high profit margin elective surgeries allowed continue). Effectively, power decided protect one group shift entire burden onto another group rather take burden alleviate burden harmed group. 

To make things worse, public convinced deserved morally acceptable burden. IMO, government unwilling follow science/data prepared protect livelihoods mandating destroyed, unfortunately would morally better nothing. government could've given risk means stay safe sustain home. Instead either. instead somehow we've convinced accept ridiculous standard nothing else could done reality massive government failure protect health well livelihoods times. wrong place burden uncontrolled outbreak deaths struggling survive specifically government's mandates control. mention horrible policy also fueled government mistrust, contributing many people longer care longer believe government competence priority make best decisions protect public health well being. haha, yeah, least sites ballpark Yup.

Yes getting paid part bodily autonomy We’re lawbreakers. law criminalises us.

You could say everyone gets arrested. ""I'm lawbreaker killed toddlers. law criminalises me"". IDK seen this, great news, thank you! 9.66 million vaccinated far, 766,000 per day. Probably one million per day end week. need run full background checks anyone let country poke around make sure spy. probably why.  don’t think literally everyone North Dakota got already. it’s possible enough people developed immunity cases deaths slowing down. Herd immunity isn’t on/off switch. Also, no, reinfection definitely common enough concern. MBA never sign high IQ. It’s signal enough disposable income incur opportunity cost tuition loan 1-2 years pursuit higher paycheck. 

Your sister might idiot. Yeah, good you. know covid, people looked weird even behaved hostile someone wearing mask, gone thus good time that, chose. also gets around ""bans"" placed one need get creative w/ pu*** di** *you’re silly* said, *mask mandates aren’t forever* said.

No. choose wear masks indefinitely.

You vastly overrating amount people people chosen go back commuting work

Eh that's really power decide bunch reports anywhere 4 15 times many people exposed virus reported asymptomatic people. find example antibody tests.

Those 10-15 figures made sense back spring, testing limited.

But nowadays, even US, can't many unreported cases. Let's pick value 10 argument's sake. would mean given day since November, would 1-2M real infections. period ~70 days, we're talking 70-140M infections entire US that's besides infections prior November. We'd already herd immunity territory case. ND only, 82k confirmed cases since September, value 10 correct, means would infections state population last 4 may playing parts country too. think asymptomatic % something measured enough really be.

I think sufficient studies pretty good idea rate asymptomatics per age group. 

You get good approximation subtracting symptomatic illness rates infection rates [CDC  want hide house half year rest life, go right ahead.

The rest us going back living, shit over.  think mixing would good. referring completing dose/course one getting another later. 

so got 100 million get 2 doses 90% effective, 80 million get 2 doses 95% effective, 50 million get single dose vaccine that's 75% effective another 50 million get single dose vaccine that's 65% effective (all numbers made up). supplies better vaccines available late year next, last 100 million might want get one others. necessarily think someone get first dose one month later decide get dose different one. finish course one started iwth get fresh dose something else later cdc advises long promote equal mandate I'm fine 160 tamales day!!! maybe started weak 50 tamales day grew stronger meds love country (EU) likely offered Oxford vaccine Pfizer doses cover high risk population reasonable timeframe. Honestly would prefer Pfizer (or Moderna) much really trust Oxford vaccine - consider far inferior, safety efficiency. think protect hospital (which great course) that's it.

I self quarantine sine last March due living household high risk relative - get first vaccine offered keep sane.

If get Oxford vaccine months later Pfizer available get too? make sense? never mentioned america, besides said wasnt there, doesnt qualify bootlicking. Learn read, moron Nov 2019 doctors China sounding alarm told quite ignored. said true, stopped saying stopped true? original danger herd immunity approach figured would result 1-2 million dead Americans. Thanks vaccine improved medical treatments, “only” lose 600-700k Americans 2020-2021 Covid (don’t get started long haul deaths). 

Reaching herd resistance point sad milestone testament horrible leadership. Nevertheless, are.

On flip side, Larry Hogan (MD) decent, along Ralph Northam (VA) think heard Mike DeWine (OH) well well. Lol. term. “Privates” euphemistic Victorian-sounding. soon enough. want follow restrictions come Spring... definitely new awareness handwashing hygiene ever used to. say gross taken new meaning. Masks though? I'd rather roll dice getting flu. right thing all, ever want see fucking mask over. Seriously. Making tamales pain fucking ass; they're super labor intensive. Can't imagine hundreds  wear sick minority. Like 1/25 people would wear them. think missed ""If promote mask wearing social distancing people FLU SYMPTOMS, less people get every year.""

No say ""healthy people"".  Meh. People's perception risk problem sure. 

I mean think 40 cases narcolepsy per million doses high risk, however 2009 pandemic flu probably seriously harmed fewer 40 kids per million infections. 

I know numbers GBS 1976 ""pandemic"" flu, considering known killed 1 person, I'd say harm caused vaccine much. 

So think two cases benefit vaccine outweigh harm. 

There likely cases well. might interested thing put together day:

[Cervical Cancer Rates enjoyed extremely high uptake Australia something like 80% girls receiving vaccine. smashing success article came 2018 claiming 2035 Australia essentially wiped cervical cancer entirely. 

I thought check numbers see, went Aussie vital statistics site, collected bunch cervical cancer data. Looking graphs tell year started offering Gardasil?

Point there's lot skeptical about. think Americans somehow less compliant average? Sometimes hard tell sub don’t think much say matter. would expect concerts, festivals, fans sports etc 2021. No. Resoundingly no. promote reasonable societal actions - first foremost paid sick leave everyone sick (as norm many European countries already). social distancing! incredibly damaging mental health social fabric community. cannot give lives viruses exist. risk providing breeding ground new variants virus. coronavirus mutates slowly self-correction mechanisms, still mutate. cases, chances new mutations that, worst case, could prove resistant vaccines and/or antibodies people previously immune. could still get herd immunity everyone catching it. Perhaps soon consensus better let 2 million die another 5 million suffer permanent ""long haul"" Covid, rather go without restaurants vacations stuff like that.

(Talking U.S.) damage (financial, emotional, societal, cultural) done going take LONG time fix. Keep mind moderately heterogenous population around 46% Americans thinking hoax 54% taking seriously. Herd immunity achieved much lower threshold values situation. 

I think near peak numbers drop far faster Spring multiple factors combine end major part pandemic Wave 1. Keep eye long haul effects wave 2 triggered unknown unknown. Oh too. end result... Well UK consistently saying ""we discovered it, mean came here"" even though biggest % penetration strain anywhere world.

So not? Maybe virus originate Italy simply took China.

Are saying China entitled view UK is? getting mobility data from? Might interesting overlay case counts.  Haha feel like that's boiled peanuts south. know they're good guy looks sketchy AF. He's saying avoiding covid things also minimize flu transmission. Abuela! dominant strain 5-6 weeks wonder whether significant extra spread COVID pandemic people encouraged leave home get tested minor symptoms, rather riding home self-isolating. education part auto filled.

You simply want right tell transparent deadly lies consequences. Sorry, don't.

The comment commentary horrible situation Mexico. really sure happen there.

But one thing sure of. people telling horrible, provable lies COVID, would much better situation.

Shame, shame, shame telling gross lie. That’s unacceptable unrealistic Southern California incredibly dry. counties hardest hit california cold, dry nights, ideal viral spread. Similar situation Arizona. 

Humidity plays important role well virus transmitted. Linsey Marr, expert viral transmission atmosphere, noted virus particles spread drier air. Furthermore, humidity helps destroy virus air. 

Compare regions within California. San Francisco area high humidity incredibly low transmission. contrast, Southern California deserts suffers constant droughts; transmission highest state. 

This say transmission happen humid regions; clearly since florida deaths per capita California. Nevertheless, leeway flaunt rules due atmospheric conditions. Areas California humid follow guidelines (SF) much much better control virus Florida. remember - educated. use title appeal authority truly lack academic rigor. personal attack. fact. Stop spreading false facts.

Also stop spamming.  cause everybody died? walking? scheduled ‘arrive’ least 6 months now.. That’s stupid. That’s clinical trials. don’t need people conducting ill advised inappropriate trials. Either get vaccine tell employer won’t, rest public get access it. over, look forward watching Covid themed zombie movie. think would milling around hallway? Visitors obviously allowed, due virus. alone accounts empty parking lots. Doctors busy trying save lives, know, areas hospital patients located. patients need life saving equipment that, know may come shocker, stored fucking hallways. share correct image? appears chart single dosage efficacy, asymptomatic spread. Borderline yes. New Zealand? american one yes. austria they'd good job. literally 81% people think mishandle it. People say everything open, lockdown end wear masks like crisis atm whatsoever... 81% people handwave dismissing pandemic. 81% people ""don't follow mainstream"" Australia turned fine Maybe God's us suffer. case aligns perfectly. don’t care don’t want it. It’s body choice. Medical professionals Gods. succumb misinformation disinformation. 

What I’m concerned hospitals sitting vaccines hopes vaccinating staff, staff aren’t open honest wanting take it, ultimately delaying vaccine released public. costing infections lives. States need move. want know pun was. point completely irrational ok say so. I'm fed people absolutely slaughter white anti-vaxxers whatever reasons (e.g. kid's autism became apparent mmr vaccine) claiming fears black ones totally rational understandable. show perhaps bad then? everything though? tell police department job? tell schools days teach? Etc never actually anything Restaurants essential sorry amigos Translation excerpt: Government begin making adjustments declare state emergency areas novel Coronavirus cases growing rapidly.

Plus science, inexact. missteps made scientists invokes fury doubt. People understanding new virus many unknowns knowns. Guesses made based viruses acted, majorly wrong, like asymptomatic spread, usefulness masks. 

At point, best thing hop time machine stop virus seeding world, s/. Read username again, slowly. ;) perfectly acceptable stance have. truly analyze qualitative data large scale, it’s incredibly irresponsible make conclusions lingering issues. It’s quite literally anti-science. need everyone. vaccinating two groups first, vulnerable (elderly sick), likely transmit (service workers healthcare workers). Studies found less 10% people spread 80% virus, mostly frontline essential workers. 10% gets mostly vaccinated, transmission rate virus going collapse downward. Similarly, half deaths among 75+ demographic, 65+ demographic responsible 85%+ deaths. right massive impact deaths hospitalizations. 

The whole idea kind 'percentage' threshold virus (the often one see 70%) highly misleading. everybody spread virus completely evenly, sure. reality small portion majority spread, small portion getting vaccinated soon. goes show much fucking scam olympics cities fall time

Get facts straight! ‘Old’ deaths would included total death counts. That's another level bigotry case, entirely hospitals/states asinine policy? vaccinating people want get vaccinated, certain percentage people want it, incredibly inefficient wasteful. somebody passes vaccine, moved list people want get it. seems like common sense Honestly. There’s fucking way hell hospital admin would risk sued high heaven would tell nurse pandemic come sick. said I’m assuming usa hospital care given anti vax talk

Ahh go article making business people way ""you're still young"", thing like that. really fucked up. Vin Scully gets first one right? long therm consequences even short term hard predict analyze. source problem, causes really deaths. could focusing much covid neglect potentially far deadlier problems. Like im sure cancer detection much lower 2020. People get depressed quarantine/lockdowns + financial problems. see effects years come even defeat virus soonish vaccinnes.

That said believe safety measures taken, Im unsure lockdowns hard things governments do. Like country(I live US), government made hospitals COVID - thus ""increasing total amount COVID beds hospitals"". is, friends father crazy pain stomach, nearest hospital couldnt take cause ""covid only"". travel others different city... coulve died car potentially...

Your argument works ways. Corona virus killing everybody overwhelming hospitals. need get vaccinated asap. fine make holding in-person service. Israel going great case study...they almost 80% vaccinated 70. Feb we'll know happens population level situation.  God willing death rates plummet. 

Also, NYC mass centers, AZ using sports stadium, San Diego using Petco Park, LA dodger stadium, finally going see big pushes week! Yep, since karma thing, take care yourself. sound like really good person. raised Catholic longer faith. let fake Christians bring down. city getting hit extremely hard:( still problem, smaller problem. (That's say actually small, even manageable, equivocation understates size problem uncontrolled spread would represent).

I'm saying right choice, although could risk toughest lockdowns collapses entirely, people may tough gentler one. 

Personally I'd favour Melbourne-style lockdown enforced border quarantine mass testing, get done quickly possible; far-right would calling dictatorship, might end governmental collapse it. know normally would able rely people taking care one another, world taught everyone ass imoortant one point actively deny reality. Amster-damn...  Look access swabs. employers want us work even we’re sick tell us it’s fine we’re wearing masks speak christians Africa, South America Middle East?

I'm religious, know little tidbit. often wonder factor passage lack precaution.

This means one two things:

1. stronger lockdown otherwise would combat it; 
2. pressure healthcare system leading worse outcomes cases need treatment.

The question is: possible long-term side-effects (what would likelihood breaking percentage) yes, dangerous would be, according you?

Really hoping far better Governor come with. Since basically fucking nobody properly wearing masks, washing hands social distancing (adding fact masks aren’t magic), lockdowns literally way curb infections state/province/country collapse. 

I’m sorry sucks, agree, used go essentially every night, see girlfriend, etc. method force infection rates people collectively decided keep behaviour standard. Ignorant fucks. can't imagine thing.

Those types events pop up. work done, one heavy lifting high degree confidence.

I think going see deaths hospitilizations drop pretty dramatically next 2-3 months.

In March, hospitals woods. States start drawing back restrictions types conventions start planning, see really start going several months. time, herd immunity alive well case counts start dropping well.   400 million enough 200 million people.  


But like 230 million folks 18. didn’t “overestimate “ said “some” handful, would true. Idk you’re talking about. I'm currently at, now, many issues lockdowns, seem extremely useful making sure deaths skyrocket. suck, sure. inconvenient, definitely. But, instead suck make sure around me, vulnerable, don’t die live awful side effects. 

Sure bro, business owners employees livelihood suck up. kids getting inferior digital education genuine social contact peers suck up. Anyone who's thought killing lockdown suck up. guys should’ve taken lockdowns bit seriously beginning, guys would leniency moment. 

That would helped. COVID-19 clearly seasonal degree, evidenced fact nearly North America Europe seeing cases soar despite ever tightening restrictions, cases far lower summer months fewer restrictions.

Why US like that, think amount cultures fruit/veg grow able get everything. San Diego too! turned Petco Park vaccination super station. Hoping see Well think reasonable expect positive trends people start get vaccinated.

I wondering much good news enough people. Steadily falling hospitalizations? Cases? many days/weeks?

I think trend pretty clear relatively quickly. Almost hospitalizations fatalities concentrated small segment population getting vaccinated first.  Considering that’s places already do,  “Unless get tested positive don’t want know” , doubt things DRAMATICALLY change wish door door tamale salesman neighborhood got MBA top 50 US university would lying said literally explicitly try get something B. legit impossible fail getting MBA. want second rose 🌹 Well never motto ever, know happened probably still happen future.

Abstract

Study objective: COVID-19 pandemic resulted widespread shortages of

personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators. Although basic surgical

facemasks commonly available, efficacy limited due primarily their

poor face seal. pilot study examined impact rubber band mask brace a

basic surgical mask, determined quantitative fit testing.

Methods: Subjects wearing basic surgical facemask rubber band mask brace

underwent quantitative fit testing using machinery designed certify N95 mask fit.

Subjects tested brace anchored behind ears, paperclip

behind head, side knobs face shields. primary outcome mea-

sure whether subject passed quantitative fit test Occupa-

tional Safety Health Administration (OSHA)-verified standard N95 masks.

Results: Subjects (n = 11) 54.5% female, median height 70 inches

(interquartile range \[IQR\] = 68–74), weight 170 pounds (IQR = 145–215), body

mass index (BMI) 24.6 (IQR = 22.2–27.2), encompassing 5 distinct N95 mask fit

types. found 45%, 100%, 100% subjects passed quantitative fit test

when brace anchored behind ears, paperclip face shield,

respectively.

Conclusion: 11 subjects included analysis, across range body habitus

and N95 mask fit types, passed quantitative fit test mask brace was

anchored either face shield paperclip. data suggests although the

brace create N95 equivalent terms filtration, would offer improved

protection airborne viruses worn basic surgical mask. numbers probably comparable countries anyway. would better work excess deaths.  You’re speaking outcome cause potential solution would prevent outcome. Well depends upload.

“Harambe didn’t die this.” gives conservative estimates, probably June/July things open, maybe less capacity masks. American surgeon tried treat cancer induction high fever, thus kicking immune system overdrive. inspired patient whose cancer got better serious infection. Later, used set toxins (Coley's difference cannot big due supply. flu vaccine can't created thin air - orders winter placed anyone ever heard covid

I'm skeptical. ""blend"" devised vaccine year usually determined summer months based flu strains present southern hemisphere. cuomo may indicated might aiming earlier today Exactly. Saying “I promised 100 million vaccines first hundred days delivered 116 million” sounds lot better plus unforseen logistical hurtles won’t necessarily derail entire goal.  Could also mean many flu cases misdiagnosed covid cases. 65,000 1,000 big drop. study testing affects people flu instead covid? Would come positive? mean still get flu shot. Say slim chance get develop secondary pneumonia (most common complication influenza), get adequate care need normal circumstances since hospitals overwhelmed COVID cases.

That's logic behind people vaccinated flu year, reduce many hospital visits possible. cheap quick do. it. Dicks High chance yes we'll back normal sometime year. Thank much that, looked methodology current model, think checking pages seen back summer (that ""true infection"" page created July calculating called IIFR).

However, read [the /u/hate_actually I'm still unclear 3x rate make sense.

Using [Approach 4 data ND positivity rate 6.94% (let's say 7%). applied 3x rate entire pandemic, would 21% (I'm aware little higher rate definitely 3x early on).

With 1.4M tests done ND (including antigen tests presume), would give 294k infected individual.

I see take peak % apply entire wave higher % could mean better detection rate (lower 3x). could mean detection rate that's identical, simply infections occurring peak, apply peak % extended period time, overestimate real number infections.

I believe argumentation relies number individuals would need tested produce numbers. Well, know website provided people tested average 4 times. creates distortion towards people get exposed virus. large share infected reported positive 1 2 tests only, remainder (those apparently dodging virus) get tested average 5 6 times instead 4.

And approach also consider tests done. Hypothetically, number tests constant - say - May December, would get large share tested population could tested negative 1-2 times wave, caught virus tested afterwards. understand that's extremely unlikely scenario, 1-3 tests done overall positivity rates higher 5%, get LOT negative results people eventually get infected.

In case, I'm arguing ND reached herd immunity all, seems ~25% population infected little low considering [ND excess deaths officially attributed [CDC general IFR US 0.6-0.8. Good news trials elsewhere? ""small pharmacy""?

They still exist, less common. certainly see every street corner like CVS (more often hospitals downtowns), exist.

I went high school guy whose dad owned independent pharmacy local hospital. still job wfh? I'm betting could hit 2M/day end January. question whether supply meet demand. see possible Cali state florida whatever want way

Good luck extent. time.

And happens, beautiful is. Good luck + people change behavior guess. Heh sure.....everyone loves good rosy prediction....those gone swimmingly thus far got heavily voted saying thing days ago.

Makes total sense people likely gotten immune unable spread it. question asking since beginning.

If boss tells they're going give promotion, ask when, give answer, keep making jump hoops saying, ""well, maybe quarter, next quarter!"" eventually going pissed stop jumping hoops. Chances are, even look new job, quit frustration. 

That's we're going through. We're told there's carrot somewhere, nobody's telling us we're going get it. 766,000 first doses per day US average last three days, per CDC. That's uh... clever?  Narrator: not.  average population India much younger US. probably lot asymptomatic minor cases never got recorded testing fewer hospitalisations degree openness. Can. Confirm. Well tias wrong meat, chuchitos one would actually describe ""stuffed"". meat sauce completely encased masa. 

As banana leaves maybe that's tias/family preferred. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 62% still protects you. That's par better annual flu vaccine 40-60% effective year still happily get that. 62% symptoms. remaining people got symptoms need hospitalised brilliant since means even get symptoms getting oxford vaccine likely still keep hospital. End dsy That's really want prevent severe symptoms needing hospilisation.

End day regardless vaccine efficiency rate high chance kept hospital Stop sex gorillas people. Getting J&amp;J involved distribution would huge boost. Much easier storage requirements hopefully much lower rate sever allergic reactions people wont need monitored 15 minutes shot.

Promise. ❤️  Same. got swine flu pandemic back 2009 I've religious getting flu shot every fall since then. I've never damn sick life. Seems similar efficacy viral vector vaccines like Oxford vaccine.

I think one good things come pandemic amazing new technology mRNA vaccines are. They’re faster produce, safer, effective older types vaccines. Lots work went this! That’s ALOT. making tamales since little one. partner made 11 dozen. we’re youngish. gotta cook meat. Make sauce. involves de-seeding dried Chiles, boiling them, blending them, frying sauce! Make buy masa. make gotta buy lard broth seasoning. gotta Soak husks. Prep fillings like cheese chilis, olives etc. gotta spread, fill, Fold, steam all. package them!

It’s huge production they’re honestly GOLD. start gradually ease restrictions

Who ""they""?

Because ""they"" mean ""The Government"". data lag really frustrating. imagine lot people mashing F5 hoping see number grow faster. We're prison number gets 100s millions.  valid point especially someone lives area taking seriously lol. 

I agree everything said around hope proves true. Dr Strangelove reference always gets vote. Look people want hide basements wear masks, fine me. care. care bathe Lysol, whatever floats boat. make it. hide. Let rest us move lives. simply cannot stay closed vaccine hits critical mass. cost high. nothing left open. must reopen economy, must smartly safely. they're probably worried it, culture may dictating be. 

Hell, there's caste system still place (I learned \~25 years ago), might culture - given country billion people, surprised - kind says, 'f- it, I'm caste, can't much it, society says born wrong place I'm screwed forever, COVID worst problem. I'm going live."" One friends doctor - he's one that's bit skeptical vaccine. mind waiting months because, words, ""I wrap much protective gear, I'm like Robocop."" 

He says he'd still continue anyway, even vaccine, see need right now. Michigan/Illinois/Minnesota 2 months ahead California curve still indoor dining open.

I see path California looking anything like normal summer earliest. COVID gonna way common flu it? think sex work comparable murder?  What? don’t want to... wear masksforeverplease? Heh worth annual flu shot 40-60% effective still helps. Oxford vaccine whuch around 70% efficiency better annual flu shot. Also important note symptoms. 70% symptoms. terms hospitalisations hospitalisations I'm aware severe cases quite frankly brilliant. 30% symptoms we're mild cases win book. got reasonable chance symptoms extremely high chance it'll keep hospital really want end day. Yay stockpiling thus fulfilling prophecy stores going shortages people encouraged stockpile. happened spring well. Ridiculous. shit needs stop. Interesting Asians willing vaccinated compared races. Likely zookeeper riot may end killing Congress-representatives all. Maybe 20 years ago. online websites, pimp becomes obselete. takes 15 minutes setup page start getting calls/messages Anti-lockdown people lose shit every time Fauci article posted. hero! shit, already cancelled cell plan preparation free 5G Got typo math error place. Press release next Monday then? I'm really excited one! Yup. 1 every 1333 people. Quite horrifying. Ha, read comment thought well, won’t vaccines take care “long term effects virus” fear mongering? realized, oh wait, “long term effects” argument ridiculously applied vaccines. Madness. Would poachers issue wildlife contraction? animals would presumably dead contact poachers. making fun know close sacrificing risk, make sense get risk vaccinated early quickly stop sacrificing much? Kinda common sense.  gave them? Take America!

The thing rural areas logically struggle logistics *because* rural. fact top states distribution rural states make us stop take stock less rural states doing. WV vaccinate largest portion population date, large cities able even better. Since aren't, there's something learned there.  ready gorilla strand.

Whelp. 

That's got say that. bets Hollywood. 

Once get high-price stars deciding COVID depriving much-needed attention, it'll over. getting 8 million people? 8 million doses I'm seeing. Seeing two doses weeks apart, number I'm guessing probably closer 4-6 million growing number getting second dose. single good post Florida even was, Biden is, one person. *ever* be. He's talking positive news California upvoted whereas positive news Florida downvoted. think everyone knows why. got Moderna vaccine 8 days ago. arm sore vaccine, seem worse vaccine. extreme fatigue started couple hours vaccine lasted 18 hours so. that, fine. fact, states. pressure people going decide reopen,

As always been. people sub realize Government takes bite rights, take bite Government get back. Thanks 1,900 25 million people younger 50. 

0.008% population less 50 years 21st Thursday calendar. get neutralization titer comparable severe cases, I'd guess, push low-responders protected zone.

But course, immune system complex thing. could start speculating wildly, maybe pushing neutralization high Moderna Biontech could detrimental part immune response, simply know this. Could also production &amp; marketing thing, get onboard fear side effects mentioned. lot people talking long term affects like leave suffer worst long term affect all, hypochondria. Every little cough sneeze means must terrible effects “long covid” people assholes morons. Exactly. That's suddenly multiply manufacturing capacity. watching masses behaved last year indication... much would surprise point Dogs, deer mice, pangolins, monkeys (used testing, probably fair expect apes/monkeys infected). Given list, probably exhaustive, also probably fair expect lot additional species also vulnerable infection. Scan save!! awomen. 

Jokes aside, really hope push long Covid also ""its still going outside developed world"" excuse continue restrictions. 

Full disclosure - I've followed precautions letter since last Spring, go jump volcano deaths ICU rates go soon. That's tragic. close avoiding outbreak. Yup found even technical degrees higher level mean much. Classes seemed get easier graduate level. conceptual definitely easy breeze truly care topic. Damn thing aggressive. 

I think answers remaining questions much transmissible. ""Sex"" speak of?  like ""I'm everything avoid car accident driving"". recently moved Arizona small town Ohio never tamales life. new neighbor nice older Mexican couple. got knock door recently woman big bag authentic Sonoran style tamales us. tamales Mexican grandmother, I’m worried try tamales anywhere else know won’t good. Dangerous comment, need stop acting like COVID-19 automatic death sentence Yes, discussed ad nauseam sub. deaths hospitalizations fall things open back. one wants see businesses suffer already have. 50% country even want vaccine. going cases long time. cases mean close things down. close economy cases flu. deaths fall vaccine becomes widely available see many many things open back way were. Yes maybe still wear masks hopefully early spring middle summer see glimmers was. According United States, ""high degree confidence"" covid came Wuhan Institute Virology laboratory. another UN organization. United States America best intelligence agencies planet. credible? go doctors office. get local pharmacy. Depending occupation, also get work school. 

It's accessible really excuse unless legitimate medical reason to. get flu shot either reason. go self quarantining avoid covid, applies flu.

Once covid vaccine available flu season over. see reason get flu shot. thing I'm sure touring bands/act. 2020 tours rescheduled 2021. Would band still mount large tour can't shows places like California, NYC, Chicago, etc? It'll interesting see changes course next months.

FWIW, concert (Maren Morris Red Rocks September 6) cancelled weekend. I'm feeling pretty pessimistic large national tours. think acts going want take risk multiple shows many different states, different restrictions. acts bother see hardly non-US acts. logic everyone would vaccinated weeks. risk includes many aspects -- 1) amount exposure sick people job entails, 2) personal risk sickness poses demographic people certain health conditions, 3) risk onward transmission due one's job demographic. high personal risk due contact sick people believe higher doctor nurse's daily contact sick people? high personal risk get severe illness due Covid? not, unfortunately concede people really need you. vaccines highly effective something like week second dose eat husk! Minnesota indoor dining reopened today actually. Hopefully isn’t another wave March vulnerable population vaccinated know people it, nowhere near 20% people know. think possible asymptomatic cases way common think are? LA eased lockdowns. filming outdoor dining.

New York made mistakes, ""first"" encounter virus, US response plan. New York crushed curve six months. things considered, success. understand? Catholics drink generally lively cultures.

You're thinking protestants. Yeaaaaah, response told needed know. used work nigh shift bunch Mexican ladies, bring big pot food everyday, one ever bring dinner. chip $20-$30 week time food. Gave 15min extra prepare dinner.

I miss place! hope so. I'm tired right thing sacrificing mental health. bet ask store staff tell rolls by. sometimes route week. Otherwise hit Mexican grocery store probably give insight get authentic tamales. Bummer didn’t know though. 

My time Northeast also trained avoid anyone selling items trunk car. It’s strange wonderful country live in. Crime, drugs hard labor. point 'hesitancy' 'skepticism' really act protest government President Macron. French never really like either, certainly favorite pastimes like spending time bistro taken away them. I’ve seen people float around idea letting vaccinated elderly healthcare workers attend things similar olympics person... I’m going punished elderly that’s ridiculous.

How much narcissist consider people getting something punishment you? Super Grandma God. Oh! Warrant canaries! clever tool. Reddit used one those... sure - may least part (although explain Dakotas others). seems, least surface, lot states started planning pretty late sort assumed everything would work out.

I'm Phoenix area. girl high school would bring every couple weeks, made freaking killing. Yes, Italy well know coronavirus hotspot, full caves bats, coronavirus research institutes scientists. shit. flu comparisons come idiots arguing bad faith. Surely, obtuse asshole yourself, realize immune systems comprised much, much “neutralizing antibodies”, right?

Yikes man. Couldn’t even finish rest word salad. logic can’t move around night difficult go to/from peoples homes. Sure, could get around staying put overnight isn’t always practical. yeah, nighttime curfew reduce socializing. piqued curiosity looked up. sound Protect Willy! outbreak facility mean lab made. facility area due proximity cave virus likely sourced.

People jumped decided great conspiracy. following guidance politicians? Listen scientists, politicians. though, people got vaccinated couple days vaccine approved... He's 93, probably already got first dose. Ugh, parking lot gives nightmares trying get games Great western forum. Yeah, long isn’t cluster unmasked people standing around refill.  already received one dose Pfizer's vaccine

She got vaccine, still got sick Went see friend came back town Puerto Rican mother's house, GF confused handed plate food second walks door. honest, think pretty conservative estimate. people argue flu season would terrible. I'd argue that, terms actual flu, we'd I'm lightest flu season modem history.

Looks like right. estimates least 10% entire world gotten COVID point.

But that's actually good thing since means IFR actually lower people expect therefore COVID less deadly reported.  mention something, think UBI good idea. disagree, think paid labor best way incentivize people things moment. UBI would undermine that. I'm offering revolutionary idea like UBI, I'm saying understandable ultimately meaningless point view without contextualizing defining work value consider “endless growth” ultimate object.

This straw man. think endless growth ultimate object. meaningless say capitalism motivates people work. best way provide everyone's needs? questionable. think human nature anything unless hasn’t proven true studies UBI. fact people tend happy healthier begin seeking alternatives types work shoehorned prior study.

There lot bullshit work there, true. bullshit work actually needs done. get someone mop office building except paying them?

Capitalism bad society lets be. consumerist society/world that's people want. lowest common denominator, efficient way provide everyone's wants needs. want carefully curated, sustainable, ethical way life, capitalist economy provide that. people essentially lazy, want spend least amount money everything.

Automation pose interesting challenges. automation think even serious argument UBI. things automated, pay people *must* work way anyone receiving UBI. even might enough get necessary work done world. used go work visibly sick. always worked public facing jobs times looking back probably called stayed home. They’ll probably take little longer sucks people told COVID problem.

You might problem. might pre-existing condition COVID term popular consciousness, COVID, care COVID, *care*, man. 

For many people COVID worst problem. they're getting really sick told forced care COVID beyond wants needs. back-of-the-napkin-math predictions actually match predictions one better covid modelers surprisingly well:  👀 help math. method used Minnesota shows seeing 1-2 per week.. normally 2K cases per day pretty flat R0 R0 2 3 soon till 1 case per day , 100, cross 1000 ? doubling take least week? Since aren't, there's something learned there.

Don't rely feds. West Virginia themselves. Everyone else went feds plan LTC. wholesome. make good points. agree, definitely see things like festivals fans sporting events, even limited capacity. 

One thing I'm sure touring bands/act. 2020 tours rescheduled 2021. Would band still mount large tour can't shows places like California, NYC, Chicago, etc? It'll interesting see changes course next months. 

But agree, initial statement probably little doom gloom.  Full text: **J&amp;J Plans Submit South African Vaccine Trial Data Jan. 21**

By Antony Sguazzin

Johnson &amp; Johnson’s preliminary data South African arm phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial ready submission U.S. regulators Jan. 21, according head country’s Medical Research Council.

The timing ties U.S. drug giant’s statement interim data late-stage trial conducting number countries expected end month. data show one-dose vaccine safe effective, J&amp;J approach U.S. regulators emergency use authorization February, “other health regulatory applications around world made parallel,” according company.

Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser U.S. Operation Warp Speed program, said emergency clearance could granted U.S. regulators early February.

Well, looks like South African/Brazilian variant might escape immunity, may right. dry, Florida ""freezing"" last month so. read Sanofi may help produce vaccines companies. Hopefully others fallen behind increase supply quickly. Twitter tons new normal, pro lockdown users , also claims earlier year accounts terminated speaking lockdowns. honestly think Twitter ceased exist would much better place said thing Texas.

Chicago's always trying pretend Texas exist. application Method getting used Minnesota hot press.. inside source 400m doses delivered July moderna/pfizer? That's brilliant considering almost guaranteed oxford/J&amp;J approved July we'll enough reckon July There's lot folks thread (and similar ones) conflate anyone pro-lockdown callous introvert understand mental health impacts pandemic. That's often case.

I'm pro-lockdown, fully realize mental health impacts millions people cooped straight-up *horrific.* leading permanent mental health scarring even increased suicides. awful.

I realize *more* awful hundreds thousands people literally gurgling death mucus, dying preventable causes due health system crash try get handle this.

This pandemic. easy answers. favour lockdowns still acknowledging (and experiencing first-hand) horrific side effects. trying starve even greater horror letting virus tear population unhindered. factories built decades ago. know downvoted hell, date pretty realistic. 

Live Deep South, state timeline showing estimated vaccine date ""Nov-Dec 2021"". looks like account hacked Trump  gruesome sounds, 200-250k people die every month US average. guess waste doses can’t find healthcare workers state. came ridiculous phase system. Meanwhile cases going vaccines stay unused refrigerators. really frustrating thing 9 months come something. 9 months!!!! really hope comment ages well... Yeah think thats reasonable well, im lucky live state endless outdoor activities know helps cause really hard judge smartest thing is. Thanks replying, feel little selfish posting like everyone boat... least see end near pandemic. Yes... Alberta... shithole Canada. NIH good short writeup Ivermectin acts inhibiting host importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, part key intracellular transport process viruses hijack enhance infection suppressing host antiviral response. Ivermectin therefore host-directed agent, likely basis broad-spectrum activity vitro viruses cause dengue, Zika, HIV, yellow fever.

Remember ""in vitro"" (literally ""in glass"") means ""in petri dish lab"".

But there's big gotcha little farther Ivermectin shown inhibit replication severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell cultures. However, pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies suggest achieving plasma concentrations necessary antiviral efficacy detected vitro would require administration doses 100-fold higher approved use humans.

So there's concern either one could either a) take drug ""normal"" dose anything virus b) take drug higher dose horrible side effects cause sickness (or worse) own. tell people circle do. Meet outdoors go walks, meet porches yards parks.

Damn would great first sentence novel. I've one antibody test, pcr, rapid. Also, bumpkin states (dakotas West Virginia) awesome vaccine distribution bet bottom dollar it’s they’re super restrictive gets it. bet put vaccine arm keep moving. reason bet I’ve seen happen rural counties live public health departments using loose restrictions. Wish one counties.... There's evidence, explicitly studied protection provided vaccines also reduce chance transmit. vaccine 100% effective, still possible transmit vaccinated though. Everything I've seen said vaccine prevents sickness, necessarily transmission. Masks still recommended vaccinated still carriers. sarcastic, realize California's overall deaths per capita even close high? 

If worried California catch up, bear mind deaths per capita past week much higher. mean combination coup/superspreader event?  affects business. too. whole question would supreme create us sole person idolizing them. Seems kinda narcissistic it? grew see youre deep community. see good parts turning blind eye bad. understand people get especially back churches cornerstone social life many communities. Since that's become less common people appear leaving church larger numbers. already died. North South Dakota HUGE infection rates. 800,000 people whole damn state REPORTED cases something like 80,000. That’s insane. Well considering federal government given anything Covid related, guess going wait Biden’s team start coordinating want Olympics summer? cancel 2022 also get national guard involved? You’re crazy feeling way. Maybe go something every couple weeks, small groups, limit risk spreading virus. Thank responsible long, really hope move past soon.

I'd like see studies referring find studies show strong correlation mobility patterns case counts. counts fallen way 18% ND. They're literally 80% peak. I'd love see mobility data cite, can't believe looks anything like ND's case graph.

You need large drop mobility trigger large drop case counts... time remove people population, remove potential transmission vector. ND look like entire rest Midwest. takes incredibly suspension disbelief think mobility data states different Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota Colorado tracks different California, Texas Florida.

Here's graphs Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin Colorado. Trend lines same. Smooth arch. Period viral seeding exponential growth hit lag coming down. Florida trend line continues rise.  

And California decrease mobility nearly month North Dakota rest Midwest region. look cases, peak month North Dakota appears two outlier peaks Christmas New Years.  suspension disbelief necessary. requires looking data.  tips taking w friend thinks fine travel Turks Caicos? following 'her states guidelines' depending state guidelines basically meaningless. find actions selfish self-centered, also realize I'm much strict lockdown US. tied property records.

America guess It’s almost experts told us would happen last April didn’t needed don’t prevent it... wanna say appreciate editing admitting understanding thought did.
Takes grown ass person admit they're wrong. commend good sir (or ma'am). Partly got actually vaccinated everyone else got hard make new friends infect lot trouble trusting people general.

people consistently give good information appear trying manipulate get trust. anyone tried manipulate dishonesty not, even ""my best interest"", once, reason suspect again. #JustAFlu true, thats numbers might off. still waiting last stagecoach return word they're faring winter.  still see people going around shopping normally malls  World Cup 2022 December Really 6 ft. figure could reasonably expect someone places. easy estimate well, basically two people arms length other.

It like Covid magically stops transmitting 6 ft. always less risky closer. understand ""getting 70 million doses end APRIL"" mean 70 million people vaccinated right? vaccines two doses challenge logistics getting shot arms vials warehouses central Illinois it’s still 50/50 people wearing masks don’t. debunked months ago it? There’s real plan, California lockdowns officially “indefinite” news came weekend public health officials. live Bismarck, second largest city state. period masks recommended, saw lot folks wearing them, even businesses required them. city passed mask mandate 2 3 weeks state, saw 1 person without one public. state passed mask mandate, I've seen one couple without masks people following it. can't speak smaller towns rural areas though.

Now layer Federal, State, local regulations, get this. Welcome government-run healthcare

I list least 12 friends qualified get vaccine even know sent sign-up sheet Y'all gave us first would guess probably reduces bush load would breathe substantially, got close contact someone lived would probably still enough expose them. They're good job catching deaths per capita past week much higher. Fauci quoted saying believe vaccine stop transmitting virus wait Data back Moderna Pfizer. still managed 1000 deaths ofc humanity fuck half ass anyway I’d like know see country (US) world 2021 beyond ND high rate per capita, also seeing worst ramifications therefore people would start caring?  Ok. again, country's government type irrelevant whether lockdowns work. able lockdown mean lockdowns work. means cannot lock down. right far easier authorities countries implement lockdown, change fact lockdown. Yeahhh World Cup 2022  Still argument epidemiologists wrote above? Still attacking me?  Except don’t get garbage media platforms. Hell research job really isn’t really much basic info easy find. sources, feel free share. talking public health campaign save millions lives, yes absolutely spoon fed people, hell would expectation? People busy, poorly educated, tons different often bad sources info shoved face day long. Unified simple messaging answers basic questions efficacy safety everywhere. used 2 hour commute work. Actually, I've done three times. SONGS still running, Fountain Valley, Blythe, 157 miles hell earth. apartment sleep week first shift 16 hours. absolute nightmare. I'm sure wjatvthe advisory for, companies least consider allowing people work home. Hawaii well compared rest country.

Right we’re running 10-50% capacity necessary Christmas, depending day. 

And point wasn’t produce economically, it’s kids, need leave house, bad 95 year olds shouldn’t really get it. won’t live long enough benefit. That’s reality.  Super Bowl Sunday definitely be.

The two, maybe much, going probably cause sort spike.  RN covid here. absolutely get vaccine anyway. know much vaccine antibodies innate antibodies. Don’t overstep boundary here.  South Dakota still pretty bad. friend told today talked someone symptoms denier anything, going get tested would cost $250. Outside anecdotes, positive test rate 25% climbing (the national rate 7-8%).

Remember SD state government chose use money federal government offered to, among things, bring testing costs. dont see super bowl would different every NFL match played 2020

Because significantly larger percentage people watch Super Bowl NFL Game, common people Super Bowl Parties. Take home oh, 'accelerate button'... cold enough get soaking wet.  be, especially allow thousands fans. California trying hard possible catch everyone else's death toll people refuse wear mask stop mass gathering. isn’t political. deceiving think COVID-19 political. entire sub dictated politics. I’m churches business plan,

that's stretch

more like pay-as-you-go pyramid scheme Daytona 500 might stretch, Valentine's Day, many people going restaurants, cause people unmask themselves, eat. don’t know I’m supposed know get vaccine... I’m atheist understand position. bad actors abuse system. hear paedophiles news assume it’s 100% priests. 

But frankly, that’s straw man argument. vast majority people, running participating, regular humans want live good life. join community give charity support other. homophobia gender oppression shit really exception rule. 

The fact live life trying get heaven affect life way whatsoever die end. agree there’s afterlife therefore efforts futile. Therefore actual impact belief life whole planet generally net positive. 

So dipshit priest wants keep church open, don’t give rat’s ass. must catch rona live consequences. know it’s tiny sliver bigger picture priests care congregation. news it’s exceptional. brings mind bit can't reason someone something exactly reason way due dilligence first place agree disagree you. see problem handle 3 generations house apartment? people hourly wages often go overcrowded schools. people like can't take work go infected spread more. really win. 

Personally careful community.  wish cause another pain. wish add someone else's bills. that's lose jobs. North Dakota like 12 people though 2nd link showing error seems extremely reasonable me! think route we’ll end going for. biggest challenge knowing party treats like establish rules guess people seem bit top, im kind like anyway certain situations. think general consensus outdoor spread like exceptionally rare unless share something like food, drinks, vapes, cannabis products ect?  That’s hospital’s policy. say no, wait it’s available general public. Still 50% gotten vaccine. sure friend turned around mask mandate. Thanks shutting trolling comment - really thought someone would bite Covid deaths matter now. know. Maybe distance, maybe insurance, maybe miscommunication somewhere along line, maybe want get tested already knows result would be. firsthand information want get far speculating, least clear he's pretty unhappy Kristi Noem co. jury system works shows bring like 50 people choose 12 like. bring 50 people 12 shots send 38 home things going disaster. fact matter still need scheduling system. jury selection process essentially gives pool people mandated come day. absolutely fill role figuring schedule 15 min vaccination windows demand thousands sites. reconcile data original projections (2.2 million deaths) current mitigation efforts? think two broad possibilities.

If imagine true, ""max"" COVID deaths US would 575,000 (maybe high 700,000 imagine R0 higher elsewhere, herd immunity reached later). case, ripped society wide open even accomplish much. *could* actually case ""cure worse disease,"" cure extremely ineffective. Obviously keep hospitals water, could done summer ""herd immunity"" strategy. California, cases never high, saw massive surge winter. 

On hand, SD ND might done. We've seen waves come go, necessarily line restrictions. Places like NY, NJ, experiencing winter surges despite considerable death (which could correspond considerable immunity), though, notably, surges smaller CA despite fewer restrictions. Immunity may playing significant role already, perhaps waning places hit early, leading smaller surges. Alternatively, parts ND SD may simply spared, far enough hot spots COVID yet really penetrate communities. Though nearly perfectly matched deaths/capita puts wrench this. Further, serology studies would tend corroborate this, also know antibodies far perfect may wane long immunity does. 

Clearly, lot virus yet understand. However, think far sure thing ND reached herd immunity. dad's doctor. joking? whole thing started there. likely one disgusting wet markets. Tucson worse travel (like flying plane) relatively low risk assuming take precautions airport get tested and/or isolate upon arrival. absolutely want interfere that's bring up. 

or could quit trying police one individual friend people getting shit work gatherings control over. that. Ive sheltering place greenland months 95% people immune, infections drop 95%. models yield result, enough data determine correct. Yeah seems random, im fortunate know handful people got like really really sick almost everyone know got like less normal head cold mild symptoms. dont want exception anyone family friends families exception. Challenging times friends! We’ll make hopefully never return sub except nostalgia :) agree. would far efficient scheduling system. Except don’t scheduling system right handle call volume. jury selection system isn’t prone favoritism crashing. jury system plans plenty drop (no shows). 

Because right now, Florida 50%+ available vaccines distributed. let’s stop waiting distribute due lack scheduling systems lack means target certain populations start leveraging systems have. 

I’m suggesting turn mandatory draft. one forced. You’re busy assigned date? state? interested? problem, wait scheduling system flexible service. completely fair? course not. Life isn’t fair. it’s reasonable start get something place scheduling place months ago. feel issue misinformation could drive person nuts news (since thrive ad revenue actually providing news) find ways make seem pandemic last forever. It’s plateauing based data SoCal hospital network, one largest county. obviously expecting holiday surge build already overly stretched capacity plateau. nothing lockdown working. 4 million city small city. extremely strict lockdown several months tough worked. Obviously closed borders helps nobody enter unless 2 weeks isolation hotel. Obviously UK America going tougher time controlling size population efforts weak pathetic importantly slow. Absolutely! think we’ll this. partner need type social interaction asap cant healthy longer. easy months roll without seeing people days definitely gets confusing whats acceptable haha. appreciate everyones input greatly! mean, miserable enough live either Dakotas, already given wanting live. Good!

Liberals break COVID rules constantly, well Reddit hypocrites.

Imagine toxic want genocide Christianity face planet.... J&amp;J providing twice many Oxford/AZ believe course shot one dose, would think they're important ending appreciate feedback. Obviously going exactly 18.5% entire population.

It's going quite bit lower, ""bit."" randomized testing. likely tested symptoms. talking taking multiple tests given day. I'm talking people taking multiple tests mid-August now.

Positivity rate single day measurement. People taking multiple tests mid-August would increase number tests (because unique tests denominator) would lower positivity rate. I'm trying give everybody benefit doubt use maximum positivity rate numbers here. actually lowering positivity see far-fetched near 50% ND infected looking graph showed me.

Because math. work out. again, serology testing show anywhere near 50% population SARS-CoV-2. serology testing measures number people antibodies SARS-CoV-2 meaning previously infected. 50% population previously infected, serology testing around 50%. nowhere near day 18.5% COVID tests positive (7-day average), percentage population would estimate currently COVID?

You cannot tell based that. Positivity rate skewed toward symptomatic contact infected person. percent population that's actually infected likely going less positivity rate. Great news. 49 go  surprised. people like still hold events asks masses donations. Uncle’s answer great. Discuss risks household weigh pros cons, see select friends/family page you. isn’t long shot it’s better pace expect full lockdown everyone know gets vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok troll. Yeah actually big deal takeaway here. Go happy live lives friends. certainly agree trend lines - that's point. trend lines despite differences changes mobility.

Those mobility trend lines... mobility trend lines same. case waves same... Florida California different mobility trend lines waves different states. idea look conclude concluding. 

By literally using eyes. can't figure can't see similar mobility trends correlate wave different mobility trend lines correlate different wave patterns. Honestly 18% decrease mobility baseline sufficient trigger collapse cases we've seen North Dakota (80% decrease 6 weeks), states graph greater 18% decreases mobility summer/fall see massive spikes?

Which states? California? Florida? massive spikes mobility second wave massive drop mobility lockdowns. Again, disease comes waves. waves last around 2-3 months. But, one wave seed next wave seen United States lead massive third wave we're seeing now. Everybody saw second wave small assumed could go lives like normal despite nearly every freakin' scientist warning third wave coming going hit hard. 18% change mobility sufficient reduce R0 far enough 1 trigger kinds reductions, state averaged 25% reduction mobility summer never seen surge.

Are talking pre-virus baseline? baseline need going from. need go based trend line. decrease pre-virus baseline tends decrease overall impact. stop wave people start moving, virus moves them. change decent change mobility going impact virus spread. decrease pre-virus ""baseline"" particularly matter new ""baseline"" established period viral seeding. new concept here... looks like simply conflating correlation causation.

Correlation rule causation... people reduce mobility cases increase.

Except places like Florida...and guess what? Cases increasing still. mobility trend line shows case count shows. 

Do studies show correlation mobility data cases? feel like it'll earlier that- even fauci gottlieb say normal fall. take parents CNN say heart. think it’s reasonable hesitation have, hand also don’t know long term impacts covid (we know long haulers, although much right now, beyond much). I’ll also getting vaccine family it’s time. live Calgary.

Most folk actually generally following guidelines restrictions. whenever we've restrictions put place (after failed conservative government's attempts to), we've actually able get cases somewhat effectively. entering restrictions early March, one first provinces relax restrictions (May 25) enjoyed late fall / early winter. eventually cases spiked nearly 2K / day December forced restrictions seen go 1K cases per day. still fear holiday bump another peak Feb-March, part we've success implementing restrictions. 

Hopefully idiot gets shut down. church essential service. they'd rather continue distance sore arm possibly headache day? wow also wanted see Israeli gov’t localities responded form economic relief. Tons people live super small towns though. 24 state's 357 incorporated cities populations &lt;2,000. 53 populations &lt;1,000. 94 populations &lt;500. towns small hundreds numbers add fast.

Take exact numbers grain salt - widely believed intercensal population estimates completely whack parts state affected oil boom - point remains. Yes. $10M. Read something months ago government determined value. lazy google source. Time go full face mask. would Super Bowl superspreader event? Super Bowl parties? Yeah know unreported deaths 2020 excess death data far off, massive amount undercounting. also persecute blow whistle

The doctor question summoned police made sign letter spread rumor things future. allowed go back work hour later. Yeah harsh persecution. Covid-bait Repost news last year. bot account? Yeah, keep pretense, share screenshots ""friends"" revealed selfish assholes are. edit title.  Maybe places like NY people much larger social networks, means bubble-piercing, whereas ND people hang crowd time. either crowd got it, whole crowd ... least quickly. virus spreads bursty fashion. I'm quite sure said $250. see SD offering free at-home saliva tests even symptoms, I'm aware people certain medical conditions advised using saliva tests. Drive-through testing sites sparse outside eastern 50ish miles state, could see difficult get one from, say, Standing Rock reservation. would much much clusterfuck. going sorts people either trying reschedule, responding, state, moved etc. got appointments scheduled, going happen, figure reschedule else lose capacity.

It would far efficient online signup tell people allowed sign up. Forcing things people leads resistance, whether think resistance valid not, certainly makes things complicated slow. Yeah, seem right fact virus remain bound droplets/aerosol mask surface, N95 masks seem pretty good protecting virus, [despite mask filtering 0.3um virus 0.125um, aerosols exceed 

The meltblown masks vary course, typically pore size ~10um, exceeds size smaller aerosolized droplets. That's say 0% effective (even cloth masks useless), make safe expose infected people. Really confused people downvoting Oh cool neither died Amen. SD not, upper midwest states show general trends probably wrong here, think folks vaccinated, better. county basically sitting it. whole tier system lost us good amount population refusing it. time waste. Vaccinate anyone actually wants to. also understand simple that. time loosing 4K people day, vaccinate can. trash article trash title.

“However, new information tells us deaths, higher death rate among Americans, diagnosed not. people died coronavirus thought, even yet diagnosis could still die it. Things worse, also complicated.”

I wonder it’s complicated? Maybe intellectualized articles like one. Granted, written PhD.

My best TLDR: Novel approaches surveillance indicate disease may prevalent thought. means data cases fatality rates may wrong. data wrong, may making best public health, social economic policy decisions.

This need look things like: children falling behind education, businesses closing, unemployment rate excess death. us sub saying since March, story pandemic goes far beyond IFR CFR. really roundabout way saying that, sprinkling fact poor data. far know, caused wide outcry around Chinese social network. end, unless dictate people stay are, 90% Chinese people still go back hometown reunite big family Chinese New Year. spend Chinese new year parents important idea Chinese.

I quite surprised strict lock-down is. Good job deciding go painful right route. question asked. asking military wasn’t helping. answer why. live get Sinopharm vaccine free charge...now don’t want cast aspersions country quite history cutting corners quality control manufacturing, plus gather data drug hasn’t fully disclosed. everyone knows there’s slow take-up hence non-priority people get it. I’m high risk either contracting developing major issues (I hope!), I’m inclined wait that’s option me. theory virus reach sort critical mass takes off. virus come somewhere, someone travel location bring it.

New York international travel hub think happened first. took months get states like FL, AZ, TX, CA NC. lockdown, that's effective.

Two words answer that: ""Exponential growth"" 1.5 every bit bad 3.5 couple weeks later. Churches lose PPP Loans granted.  Jesus hates idiots target audience might public. read lot free studies ""public"" websites, still intended others. Indeed confused. look like intentional delay. official reason ""visas ready"", sounds like China got misunderstanding ""visa"" part. America needed see browns win last night. I'm gonna upvote since ur opinion valid anyone else's heard, silenced.

That said, disagree (but downvoting, according rediquette, disagreeing - posts off-topic, etc).

On one hand, govt stay personal health choices allowed decide businesses succeed fail. hand, people allowed hurt people, right? Even young person get symptoms, pass along everyone else community.

So pack people believe dangers virus could isolate pro-covid community no-one allowed leave til over, would thrilled. it. Catch want. Eat, drink, merry. rely medical help folks INSIDE barriers willing stay. can't call Fed assistance fate chose.

Honestly, would awesome experiment. Maybe whole community would get cases would worse bad cold, everyone would immune guys would rocking time. Or, maybe get terribly sick long-lasting side effects. knows. I'd willing watch reality show support freedom go drinking inside isolated community.

Buuuut, realize unless barriers exist, every one comes contact passing folks volunteer part party?

It's like seat belts smoking signs. restrictions always limiting freedoms - sometimes they're protecting everyone else's.  care want wear helmet Harley. Frankly, idiots die, better gene pool. care emergency workers spend time scooping highway ""freedom"" can't help family four nothing wrong we're hit drunk. local brain surgeon work 35 hours making sure walk could fine worn helmet. community (taxes) pay 500k surgery years rehab support can't walk perform job more. 

If rich pay costs incurred selfish choices - great, it, long still means rescuers available help innocent victims, too.

So, think fair make choices can/will negatively (and directly) impact everyone else community? strike selfish, all?  would make vaccines useless. difference people cleared viral particles seen reinfected false positive will. mess. hope figure out. church used go New Hampshire towns drug rehabilitation course. Churches live fund hospitals schools food banks Seriously? absolute fuckwit. Honestly? Anything lands hospital days. Shit, even you’re completely healthy takes like month recover week bed rest. that’s without even sick.

Especially you’re older good health, getting “hospital” level sick fucks up. take year recover pneumonia gets bad enough need hospitalization. honestly people late 70s older don’t ever feel surprised getting news. think 91 million might even low, data says average 7.2 infections every case. 23 million cases would 166 million infections, half country.

If think it, virus spreading nearly unchecked year gone exponential. law large numbers says burn eventually.

I think also interesting fatalities grown nearly fast cases past 4-5 months. New York 20% peak fatalities April cases 200% peak. Basically recent cases 10x less fatal. theory vulnerable people already many died, virus spreading among less risk i.e. younger healthy. need money err mean donations heaven anything else. I'm dead! hope it’s true, I’ve taking shit years already pill morning. bored explain basically yeah except travel restrictions here. hope facts honestly 80% worlds airlines grounded. 20% still making profit people think lockdown applies them. sad thing recognize God's help beat head it. expect miracle divine intervention, maybe he's trying tell put mask stay home. see sub ""hanging bar"" sub, /r/COVID19 ""the meeting room office"".

Doing Lord’s work. go back r/atheism How? started complaining LOL Theres one using developing countries good results: Ivermectin. inlaws prescribed doctor Mother law got Covid.

I’m guessing editor doesn’t like hyphenations titles. Thanks good day. top comment. Thanks extended information. must quite lot friends know EIGHTY PERCENT GERMANY. That's literally 66 **MILLION** people. Well Fauci keeps changing mind % needed herd immunity...

I think lot lower especially lockdown semi-lockdown. Also herd immunity on/off switch gradual. get 50% think spread would significantly reduced. Sorry snowflake, that's works.

You make claim, provide proof. others responsibility disprove nonsense.

And proof, posted basis reality. Move along try learn something science. Definitely agree on/off switch thought. 20-50 percent immune might hit herd immunity threshold, I’d imagine 1 5 1 2 people walking around immunity still cut transmission enough make notable difference. published public website, public. Anything possible guess given we've seen spread China first outbreak distance, seems incredibly unlikely come anywhere else.

And chance all, CCP blocking investigation probably makes certain Chinese origin. Unless they're hiding something like Xi pangolin fetish. IKR   deranged enough drive whole family car whilst dodgy vision ?  know 22 mutations? even mean? Ok, mean people completely stop wearing masks __for COVID.__ know there’s reasons wear mask, severe allergies sick flu cold want go don’t want infect others, that’s fine. I’m asking people stop masking COVID. [The CDC recently average 7.2 infections every case. agree probably lower ND sparse population still lot asymptomatic people. think 2-3x still possible. yes,  get feeling spreading weird conspiracy theories 5 days ago? mean, could argue semantics ‘kicking out’, bigger picture... 5 days ago. think there's national data many nurses refuse vaccine. Every article see half always ""a detroit hospital"" ""a texas hospital"" ...but rules govs ordained god yadda yadda he's breaking thng hes supposed follor bible..... dont elive least try ocnsitnst..... 800 tamales- took 5 days.

It's also excellent sign recovery going, also likely nice staff see. Imaginary persecution 3...2...1... Yeah, describing ""who it"" (healed immunized), ""who it"".  agree, CDC recently estimated average 7.2 infections reported case. Probably lower ND sparse population cases equal 12% population, think likely around half population exposed. Herd immunity on/off switch gradual think starting see effects already.

Definitely best way get end road there. know showcasing theological argument. But, question laws - anyone depend anyone’s theology, society built people choosing laws abide depending current flavor month. religion tells stone women commit adultery people wear poly blend clothing - laws Canada explicitly prohibit so, agreeing live society, agree abide them, despite abominations people put backs every day.

Move people want get stop punishing spending much time energy worried not. Here's latest case/death charts California, running 7-day currently 74.33 deaths per 100k population. ranks state 39th per capita Yes would good go back see. worrying part states longer one geographical area US Increase 1.1 million time last week. getting towards 2 million per week target! 


Almost jabs first doses brits second jab. prove misinformation tho? choose ignore 11th commandment personally, idea spend eternity (like, forever ever, even fathom that) place pure hell itself. First 100 years might fun, there's rest eternity. bunch them! Romans 13:2 ""Whoever rebels authority rebelling God instituted, bring judgment themselves."" True Canada. don’t President. cases equal 12% population. every case probably several asymptomatic people (the CDC recently estimated 7.2 average).

So think likely ND already 50% immunity headed much higher. live NJ, infuriating badly going. add point, go registration website NJ, says 1A even register. 

I'm sorry, nearly month, 1A hundreds thousands unused doses, probably already work hospital. waiting registration system tell go, straight want get vaccinated. move on. desperately needs open 75+ age groups they've done NY. I'm sort surprised Murphy screwing badly sticking ""the plan"" working obfuscating really means say ""doses sitting there"". Israel arguably best healthcare system world doctors per capita country  Imagine zero self awareness. Wow edgy everything money wow almost money makes world go round. 

Yeah know already, think favourite local pub nice owner run make happy? Report reddit misinformation move on. guess they'll learn stupid way. it’s ok deny access vaccine vaccine skepticism one particular group people? think it’s limited one group US? I’ve read, health care workers wide margin biggest skeptics right now, bother give equitable access? 

What I’m taking comment it’s fine limit access Blacks skeptics. Otherwise, point? Yep looking data Israel too. first shot something like 40-60% effective 5-7 days. 70-80% highest risk population. think hospitalization fatality rates start come literally within week two. sick, risking everyone’s health word god. [In tweet criticizes city mayor warned social kill parents. one world prevents looking parents' eyes saying them: love you! get diploma hero (father) keeps wall living room inviolable residence # Dia22VaiSerGigante nobody stop me. vaccinated personally prove otherwise prove vaccine? Serious question. letting stopped investigating like days (or week?) ago? pretty significant benefit vaccine one shot 5-7 days, something like 40-60%. think vaccination efforts significant benefit 6 weeks.

Also hospitalizations fatalities concentrated 12-15% population 65+ health conditions. Simply vaccinating population make big difference.

Add fact ND example 12% population already case, suggesting many people infected (because symptomatic people)... think ND turning corner next weeks looks pretty likely. Y'all remember ""they"" told us test vaccine would free? Neither are. hope rather help EU messed orders ordering late little. guess NA get enough doses anyway. Honestly could imagine EU bought / financed new plant speed production. Vaccinations going 400-600k per day past days. see 8.02M Bloomberg right sometimes bump Monday weekend data gets reported. Would surprise see 9 million tonight tomorrow morning.

[This attempts extrapolate current trends eliminate lag estimating current numbers also rolling average vaccinations per day, currently 668k. Take grain salt extrapolation helps show trends.  U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS), Registered nurses earn median annual salary $73,300 2019 Compare contrast China's coronavirus reaction UK's willingness share data regarding new strain. UK published sequencing new strain, China arrested doctors expelled journalists raised alarm. 

China shared new virus genome early Jan 2020, virus spreading December. 1 month.

UK declared new strain December, saying detected September, that's 4 months.

China expelled journalists/propagandists clamp fake news alarmist nonsense, one doctor intentionally go around saying world crying independent investigation since January, Chinese uncooperative geo-political reasons always, they're predictably keen trying save face.

The world? Mostly western geopolitical adversaries looking politicized crisis deflect poor handling home. compare prevalence remaining symptoms background rate general population determine statistically significant degree. exactly fear Bell's Palsy linked new vaccines dismissed. needed year plus week yeah, guess thats likely answer. ""cleaning evidence"" answer everyone else saying isn´t really logical. like haven´t already burned every bat,ferret fish suspected source 12 month ago. assume already suspected inspectors wanting visit 13 month ago, surprise them. won´t needed days clean something real quick. Knuckle draggers? Lol it’s serious speeding tho sooo think summer still come fruition 

If look tracker exponentially vaccinating people every day, hit like 2 million 3 days breaks heart many small business, family owned businesses, around generations shut down. Please support local businesses, communities depend them, country built them. Yep exactly it. 40% fatalities nursing homes 80% 12-15% population 65+ pre-existing conditions. vaccinate right 40-50 million people think hospitalizations fatalities fall significantly.

Then becomes virus fatality rate like 0.01% vaccinations treatments. point another virus humankind deal with. Jo reporting ICU. hope get 100M vaccinations 100 days -- hopefully politics non-factor. Gonna disagree one bit here. Yes journalist arguably worded headline badly (though instantly catch eye point headline essentially instantly clarified lead) story definitely written completely uneducated audience mind. 

Newspaper readership generally considered educated. Additionally, medical terms appear article, well specific figures (percentages, number study participants), indicates author indeed intend adress general public. 

Furthermore, published various newspapers around world, mean readership originally intended recipient. NYT could publish studies microbiology, mean NYT readership intended audience those. 

But way, I'm rambling something goes far beyond original point now. also think headline bit misleading. Two dozen tamales. That's they'd give you. want take home, they'll try improvise container salsa. leak.  Abuela make it, want it. 🤣 Looks like Pfizer/Biontech AZ supply 1/3 total EU June. EU fails approve AZ vaccine, things take months longer. However even Germany get extra shipments Q4, enough vaccines available much cheaper easier store.

FXXK say hysteria around dealers lacing Halloween candy drugs dumbest shit ever? Like media makes seem like common occurrence take minute think it, self-respecting drug dealer going a) give free drugs unsuspecting children b) give police reason show door? Ain’t dealer I’ve ever met, that’s sure 😂 Yes - article goes depth. gripe headline - many people don’t get past. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article 80% agree, restrictions might kept cases low parts country simply COVID really able spread *to* places high numbers. still states low death counts, may reach end relatively unscathed. However, would case vaccines arrived 3-9 months earlier optimistic assessments start *and* highly efficacious. Sadly, lead many politicians believe half-lockdown approach effective saving lives. next pandemic, vaccine produced, would worst possible strategy. Either contain focus efforts mitigating damage society whole, knowing herd immunity eventually come one way another. figured first time sat AOL chat. Trolling everywhere. Arguments. Sucks man.. know need get herd immunity need majority countries, going see 2021,”

This key quote think. anything new...we already knew majority countries vaccinated year. US first world countries still likely herd immunity year.  NYC complaints **statistics**

Uhh... problem? they're adjusting plan based issues poor stats, that's good thing, no?

New Jersey interesting me. governor saying doses, check Bloomberg see administered even third have.

I'm starting wonder ""delivered"" really mean delivered. Like could imagine case Trump CDC: OWS tells Pfizer send many doses state. mark delivered. takes day two Pfizer get doses packaged sent truck day two. Maybe warehouse somewhere day, several days later finally gets hospital pharmacy. even though marked ""delivered"" CDC, really delivered like 5 6 days. theory right now, [from see distributed** cumulative counts COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded **shipped** Centers Disease Control Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) since December 13, 2020.

And would seem indicate numbers think states might actually think are. ""distributed"" ""shipped"" really synonomous. Distributed me, implies PoC. Shipped means left production facility. states? California? Florida? massive spikes mobility second wave massive drop mobility lockdowns. Again, disease comes waves. waves last around 2-3 months. But, one wave seed next wave seen United States lead massive third wave we're seeing now. 

No, waves graph. chart kind lousy can't tell state which, we're comparing SD, CO, MN, MT WI ND.

If premise 18% mobility reduction ND sufficient reduce R0 level case levels fall 80% 6 weeks, 2 states mobility reductions never (or almost never) exceed -20% experience dramatic surges cases?

And time, believe states levels virus present population summer (without decreases mobility relative baseline) somehow spike exact time. needed. Vaccines certainly beneficial help get us mess. need effective treatments well. Much focus placed vaccine development. ‘patient’ someone receiving medical care. subdivided ‘out-patients’ ‘in-patients’. 85% patients mild illness, whereas 14% severe disease requiring hospitalization, including 5% require admission intensive care unit. “

Ie, vast majority people infected Covid regarded out-patients. 

This important don’t overly alarm people Covid positive (but don’t require hospital treatment) might led believe high risk developing long-term health issues. Meh kinda assuming already lol varies widely region!

Where grew Texas tamales complicated flavor onion, garlic, even oregano(that last one usually someone grew Mexico). New Mexico, however, taste like boiled pork hottest chile people find stuff them. gross. nurses know well paid, certainly ""making next nothing"". Georgia, Florida, Texas 24th, 25th, 26th deaths per 1M among US states. Exactly middle pack. people die per capita better states like Illinois, Michigan Pennsylvania lot stricter lockdowns. president? least 2 million vaccinations per week 2,700 vaccine sites across 200,000 offers non-clinical support public leading UK businesses help logistics millions people immunised spring 2,700 vaccination sites across UK, government announced today part comprehensive plans rapidly scale COVID-19 vaccination expansion programme also mean adults offered vaccine autumn. Moderna order deliveries Q4 hope able speed little bit, moment seems like mainly US vaccine. Different poster disagree sentiment, free really news worthy average American's instinct towards healthcare costs. I've seen videos.... man, UK went c0mmuni$t real fast. Arresting people going walks (outside).... they're crazy!

That’s true. guess I’m speaking USA perspective. Oh hell yeah Weebl lol don’t like either, blame texture ground corn, makes feel like I’m chewing mouthful sand. idea help delivering doses earlier US EU? Thanks posting information instead snarky comments. type information plastered everywhere, billboards, news, tv adds, etc. point information readily available general public absolutely people search answers basic questions. talking greatest public health crisis generations brought whole world knees. Many people going go blind faith vaccine safe without atleast basic assurances public health authorities easy access answers basic questions. taking kind antivaxx nonsense, not. basic public health communication talking desperately needed considering people faith government/public health institutions profit private enterprise point clearly shown either incompetent acting bad faith course crisis. idea thought Rome hosting Games 2024. cedars 5 weeks nov 2019. two follow surgeries last year. almost every staff hospitable, super nice. five weeks , constantly rotating nurses, dr's, disliked two nurses clearly like job comprehend. get high horse like, pretty easy position take bad guy reason. seem pretty hysterical seem reading much comment intended. 

I arguing blown proportion unexpected serious disease. going significant proportion population disabled this. Tell actually disagree on? Unintended consequences shutdowns often result giving spread boost. Look UK, everyone crowded trains shoulder shoulder. Look India happened didn’t give advance notice lockdown people didn’t food stocked up. Mayhem streets trains people desperately fled could get food. Many died exhaustion. Look Canada 27 times many excess deaths Covid deaths 45 demographic, includes Canadians. Mostly drug overdoses suicides. debacle. powdered donuts. future suggest finding details commenting it’s fake. save embarrassment. Hey, never addressed post.

I'm seeing whatever seeing page 24.

Isn't table 12 Page 31 data I'm interested in. What? already? Exactly. kinda sounds like one myths like razor blades drugs Halloween candy, knows, people crazy. Yeah arguing semantics, quite difference implying. I'm sorry fellow Christian must say dangerously close eternal damnation. strongest faith exist without community, like travelling monks priests go foreign lands spread Good Word savages. us weak absolute need real-life community, Zoom bs. Please understand Satan wants, separate us, us sitting alone front computer screens Sin click away. one click Pornhub touching confirmed people regular communication God Angels fast track worst fires Hell. Flock Shepard. Hell, 13 months unaided entropy covered tracks. fxxking pretentious like ever believed China

The story Dr. Li Wenqiang reported Chinese media Western media, know? media vultures go share corpse

WHO announced PHEIC Jan 31, Chinese protest? No, China say anything westerners still watching joke even realize what's happening, Chinese blockade 11 million people laugh welding people homes

Don't pretend neutral objective, judging China, Chinese

You guys deserve sympathy all, everyone replied post

Look shitty protective measures, could done 50% China beginning, epidemic would long ago

FXXK would interesting know. But, unfortunately, data good. ran month long studies specific dosing pattern confidently determine efficacy. scraps data happens outside specific dosing pattern.   Abuela like Steph Curry tamale making. canada *far* two deaths/million. guys well half numbers. know utopia long way thing  Well, lockdown *did* seems done little. point pick tool situation. New Zealand's situation, lockdown possible. US's situation, try emulate New Zealand kinda-sorta fuck anyone gets caught crossfire accomplishing next nothing. I'm big fan Biden, plan stop holding back enough vaccine provide people appropriately timed second doses HUGE mistake. 

First all, really know certainty much immunity conveyed one does, effects overall efficacy second dose delayed. 

Second, clear distribution network remotely handling even number doses currently available. 

And third, strongly suspect many people like myself, willing get vaccinated turn came long assured getting second dose timely fashion, thinking prudent wait - even delay means months longer home - things calmed enough assured receiving appropriate doses appropriate schedule. Here's two reasons NYC 1947 different:

1. NYC actually support feds. lame duck president trying overthrow government.

2. goal mass vaccination campaign right now. damage virus incredibly skewed using scalpel instead sledgehammer needs done order save lives. Shoving 320k doses anybody pump numbers save fewer lives giving 320k doses next 2 weeks nursing facilities, elderly, caring people already certainly hope not

2 posts saying ""have started it"" retreating position ""I certainly hope not."" Well guess that's best get redditor get caught spewing total BS. realize that. point articles OP posted support his/her claim.  going comment scary seems 3/4ths patients applies people admitted care, counting individuals recovered home.    pandemic fake prerequisite joining groups. credit, Facebook done decent job lately banning groups. Though, admins create new group next day. people think hospital going accept baked goods middle pandemic? Pretty dumb. That’s I’m saying bro! get 3T corporations from? categorically true, ask doctor. flu (I realise charged example) leads hospitalisation - especially older. receive check ups months afterwards. Look chronic fatigue syndrome.

I claiming exist, Covid bad disease really hurt long term. I'm saying idea 76% people hospitalised Covid still suffering symptoms afterwards high (would like see methodology, self reported fatigue good judge) surprising. 

The media whipping people frenzy this, significant problem. going significant proportion population disabled this, seem implying. misleading title? piece says:

No. would interesting know much. maybe could surprinsingly better protection population give one dose twice people, we're lucky ...the thing vaccines gone multiple trials multiple countries approving well tend thousands human guinea pigs already it.

the scary thing medical people reading data reading opinions experts understanding despite extensive educaiton.

and refusing vax vax eventually prove prevent transmission least cases would count putting patients risk.

they definitely risk putting commission getting sick unable work time, maybe worse need hospitalization.

we need education genral public apparently medical workers reduce vaccine refusal everyone's sake. doubt they'll much testing today 成人の日 either. People crowd shrines take masks family pictures, week travelling see grandma new year... next month gonna get rough. Woah there! forgot hopes minute looking vaccine progress. Welp, back endless void limbo go. Deep, deep joy.

This year's rough start, there's happy ending second half that's matters me. say ""illinois"" rather generalize mid-west? government certainly would, absolutely fault denial keep acting like Covid isn’t big deal half assing hell everything response. “Don’t go bars 10 pm avoid hostess bars. Social distance trains packed it’s literally impossible schools won’t closed anyone asks allowed work home get met teeth sucking mizukashii desu ne.” Yeah still pretty vague deaths aren’t reported, doesn’t friend responsibility report extreme adverse reactions? You’d think vaccine safety trials would catch something like this. want known for. Get together, Utahns! Fine pastor, staff, every single attendee. Fuck church. mom remote see patients face-to-face anymore. Still, got vaccine. complained administration nurses still gotten told take leave it. Apparently nurses got vaccine week, uncomfortable decision. dad extremely high-risk though also taking care grandmother, end we're glad got it. guy make couple extra dollars pass around donation plate cares kills weak flock. Weren’t Dakotas far worst country month ago? everyone already get it? Thank you! feel like push pregnant women vaccinate founded actual science. human studies handful pregnant women, I’ll wait deliver. perfectly happy guinea pig science. Im nurse. epitome profession vaccinated enough data yet presume completely stop transmission virus though. Also keep mind current data shows asymptomatic carriers spread disease less symptomatic ones. Therefore would make sense assume vaccine would help reduce transmission, since infected vaccinated people practically asymptomatic carriers. Wait hear stuff last week. educated guess, government said plan everyone 16 vaccinated end September, 54 million people age 16. that's 54 million within 9 months, need twice 54 million 4 half months. makes 12 million month 3 million week. vaccines hopefully approved soon supply ones already ramping up, mass vaccination centres coming online pharmacies pitching too. 3 million seems achievable fits governments long term plans small state agree done great job getting vaccine people. It’s nice bottom list once. beautiful state wonderful people. Phew, 100,000 people die month! mean yea realistic EVERYBODY taking proper measures. take lot work get things far better state  gathered friends Japan, already volunteers, they're making group chats type volunteering group now. I've treatment cervical dysplasia cared patients oral cancer due HPV. daughter celibate (yes really, LGBTIA autistic) yet received vaccine. going even consider possibility putting HPV. 

These health care workers see devastating effects disease. excuse. Wot enough compliance Minnesota. black white issue. actually guys initally dropping dead viagra drug interactions men going Dr asking take 'em heart meds could take viagra even lack heart med would kill too... Snark want, writing wall shit storm hit wuhan. Common sense. dealing shit show years. delusion everyone would right thing handle properly. Yes, global community done everything experts advised get go, everyone tops governments everyday folk following measures letter could’ve eliminated Covid already. *never* going happen. 'you plan well'. Sucks us chose wrong career path, it? Ten months ago unable recruit enough people work, countless texts every week begging work lost career.

And disconnect massive. Aid agencies able get countries perform humanitarian work. includes feeding poor, vaccinating things besides COVID, performing medical care, supporting education, aiding development, etc.

Oh Lord. Thanks pointing out.

Can explain difference new ""strain"" ""variant""?

Also, new covid variant would named covid-20 / covid-21 etc?

I know number corresponds year discovery. example, UK strain called covid-20? Spanish Flu killed 17-50 million people, possibly even more. Even look numbers per capita (why you?), devestating numbers. idea mean ""the advances acceptance germ theory"", overall advice time basically same. Wear mask wash hands. however live much cleaner hygienic environment much better technology healthcare access. think severely underestimating deadly previous infectious diseases were.. Corona serious, there's much much worse. According worldometer, 23,139 Americans died COVID-19 week 4–10 January 2021. Tragic, sure, indicator oft-cited prediction 150,000 January deaths unlikely, probably like 50 percent. surrounded water along Irish border even mean ‘UK’ geographically talking thousands islands.

I admit pedantic point, keeps getting repeated. Great Britain single island, configuration ‘UK’ island.  Open boil job fetish

No, flippant answer, dick ""not asking"". So, posted follow correct, generalized answer saw it, follow dickish comment, now. Nah it’s called “right wing Neanderthal”. look back realize government failed us. Im sorry things getting better. Give vaccine want it! Forget tiers. passed tiered system.

*edited fix grammatical error  took coworker's store-brand ibuprofen broke hives. fun. That’s interesting hell, feel like case wouldn’t work COVIDs case tho you’re presymptomatic you’re already shedding virus One nurse friends same. didn’t even know till political fiasco started November. sharing videos voting, breathing co2, claiming hasn’t gotten covid.

22k deaths 2019 compared 373k deaths Covid since February 2020. 650k flu deaths worldwide we’re approaching 2M Covid deaths worldwide. 

So “order magnitude dangerous” may little mark, definitely order magnitude standard deaths

This conspiracy nonsense debunked number times. Nobody getting hit car listed Covid death tested positive, least meaningful capacity.

This crisis, absolutely become political nature, overburdening health care system which, least US, already nosedive. Completely lifting restrictions “letting whatever happens, happen” would end disaster. boss supported fellow hcw's decisions get saying ""it's personal decision"" lost it. turn zoom said anything anything going regret.

It's killing people. MMR vaccine education turn around SAY SHIT LIKE THIS?!? stand tell people, not? Ah man I’m sorry came ass.

How feeling far? 2 weeks close clearing entirely already. Vaccines long term effects. effects rare takes lot people get vaccinated see it. That's study group larger ever before. make sense since still working prophylactic since vaccine immunization prior exposure period low viral load work boost. won’t work active infection pre infectious pre symptomatic period. help viral load may tampered vaccine goes much.

Fed ~50mm dose, sent states 22-24mn, 7mn vaccinated.

Fuck outta CDC. Shutgun approach - vaccinate many people possible. prob right based article lacks data says get MMR vaccine within 72 hours initially exposed measles, may get protection disease, milder illness.

North Carolina's wave start around mid October. basically two months behind. [CDC Weekly Deaths, It’s crazy people figure bs credibility goes tank. see content headlines they’re pushed anxiety like it’s cocaine. leads doubting situation shrugging guidelines. It’s like Newsome tweeting disdain people going he’s waiting waiter bring salad course. Exactly it’s like saying cop somehow must integrity average person Pandemic affects West rich nations. Yes 55 year old male, ventilator month, left hospital 42 days think. close person though they’re home healing still back work got vent, survived, healing  Ok thanks, tell arguments poor uninformed? Nova Scotia resident here. implemented rules, locked everybody (for part) followed rules laid out. cases today ~3 per day last week strict quarantines people travel here. hit around 40 new cases day started, weeks back hit ~16 day today new cases.
 
We're amazing comparison country lot people comfortably feel virus exist still wear masks, adhere quarantines listen medical community. done correctly believe quarantines lockdowns extremely effective worth it. response stop? every single time single case pops up? majority doesn’t take vaccine? Yes know like last year, right?  different someone otherwise takes vaccines cautious Covid vaccine new created new technology.

Not isn’t. **FDA** approved vaccines you’re nut job anti-vaxxer don’t trust period. else doubt every med FDA-approved?? Trumps fault right? report deaths Monday-Friday?  would expect see deaths January 11th report. exactly, no. guy makes poor, uninformed arguments therefore ignored. anyone doesn’t care people dying left permanent disabilities disease.

Anyone argument actually makes sense least considered.

Keep going though, everybody thread seems really agreeing you. somehow redditors well within expertise. think sick covid stay home, go normal time. outbreak widespread already don’t believe lockdown correct response Melbourne longest strictest lock world.

I'm sure does. reinfection rate true, everyone recovered virus, 99.9% people would immunity. issue damage would caused virus infected every person. current data suggests already it, chances immune least 6 months possibly longer.

Don’t worry, reach 60, dormant tamale genes express able easily make them. wish would say it’s deadly population individual. think people would easily understand that.

Absolute genius move. call liar without reading fully taking account saying. He’s pretty consistent fall narrative past weeks. Articles like keep getting shared redundant. people die covid, somehow someone disagrees government's handling dies becomes newsworthy. where's need specify?

The need specify comes fact public figure large audience, preached misinformation disease political belief.

How long take? Congrats Grandma! 

I hope could try Tamales visit Texas someday! Hey, need someone talk to, send DM. mean thought. Incredible gesture nonetheless.  Much focus placed vaccine development.

Was really? Definitely media focus. early pandemic, nobody counting vaccines early everyone looking treatment ideas, mostly using existing drugs.

Yes. US used less half vaccines available far. Millions doses sitting freezers people die.

Apparently, mostly due incompetence bureaucracy local level (state governors, etc). real. try pay more, try sneak tip in, discover exactly enough tamale justify tried give them. Maybe around Xmas daughter's Quinceanera accept gratuities. Otherwise, cannot change mind.

The tamale fairies wonderful group, wandering south west. I'm curious current level testing is. Fauci said weeks ago thought would able weddings June July. said thought March April would go. moved May 1 wedding seemed like would cusp, think good chance things better June.  thought dosage ivermectin treat covid humans insanely high, no? likely much. might right. protecting vulnerable basically stops deaths empties ICUs - essentially leaves behind “bad flu” class cases - don’t see wouldn’t reopen. ability smell stuck 60%.

Question: estimate part, actual medical test reports back 60%? curious, idea. thought anti-maskers US. quick story, friend contact tracer San Diego, couple times he’s cases knew positive still continued go restaurants friends, attend dinner parties etc. we’re talking 22 year olds either. people 50s 60s. one case infected four tables around them. 

So I’m sure restaurant controlled environment people testing positive still going out. people research know money going charity church. recent years left church otherwise happy (and still spend time friends met there) finances. churches pretty transparent know talk (and transparency legal course). get feeling church hiding finances, GTFO.

Well, didn’t kill parents, he? /s important keep herd immunity context, though. 


In dense city herd immunity would lot higher somewhere like ND. low population/low density area dont come contact many people, chances catching already lower. Hence growth curve much flatter them. place like NYC see exponential growth virus couple weeks. ND took months get control. 


Also, herd immunity magic number, sliding scale. maximize herd immunity may need 50 60 70 80%, obviously people get virus less likely spread quickly. 


So even 30% people got it, thats 30% fewer people spread it. gets 40% much harder spread. get close 50% on... takes longer longer virus spread closer get herd immunity. depend are. huge city 50% people it, still come contact thousands people day, take many infect hundreds more. small town see couple dozen people day half already leaves people still get pass onto others.  buddy wedding re-scheduled Memorial Day, 2021.

UK we're testing news way measure vaccine efficiency we've entered lockdown similar time vaccinations starting. it'll hard attribute overall numbers accurately. believe they're using methods based pneumonia survival rates. mean?

Definition looks mostly right me, although it’s estimate / extrapolation average. One thing sure. gonna die. us. guarantee it. 

Be afraid,... unless 50. worried 65. older that, probably get vaccinated, government busy locking people care people actually dying thing. text absurd taken literally. even create stars, moon sun 3rd day, 2 prior days. theological truths text, literal account historical occurrence. population like 12 certainly helps. trump did. interesting Thanks! family members NYC, health care workers definitely qualify vaccine. affiliated hospitals, idea sign vaccines. hopefully website ever loads, help sign up. definitely generational thing. I'm 29, I've never arsed look parents, grandparents etc. love them. 
You'll always good amount people, especially media still hold high esteem they're still essentially celebrities here. must built wall Southern boarder. Similar, Canada &amp; New Zealand allow foreign ownership media hence we've saved Murdoch disease that’s think youre acting think issue stupid cancel it. important early 2020, Japan hoping Olympics go ahead planned. took several months deciding postpone 2021.

You can't really fault aiming 2021, realistically know it'll safe 2022 even 2023. drags 2024 Japan might miss chance completely it'll time next Olympics line.

I'd wager Japan would prefer Olympics 2021 severely reduced format postpone further. wonder username /r/Canada even 5 percent current spreading worth living like you, afraid going disagree. measures causing massive amount loss life suffering. Thank you! used live Surrey (a small town near Esher). really upsetting see. data covid less risk vaccine? Covid around longer year well. I'd like see thought process. What's say young people caught ""symptoms"" ""mild flu"" long term effects well 1-2 years? Sometimes felt like sub lives extreme optimism True. Anything better fervent individualism would well, better. cancel olympics on. It’s shown corrupt organization often ruins city/country hosts it. many sports games irrelevant now. don’t know anyone wants see gymnastics wrestling. child grooming goes coaches also disgusting. Forcing young people sports won’t provide stable income likely break bodies lead abuse isn’t worth spectacle every 2 years. Japan also one anti-vax nations world. lockdown lifting per planned 3 days, masks place another 10. You’re confused. article spouses died, patients themselves. Although agree say “widow widowers”, comment makes sense. 
Besides, aren’t one posted article? Honestly learned lot 1918 pandemic this. you’d asked deadliest year US History was, I’d guessed year WWII perhaps Civil War. *Bless rains Africa...* scientists fear endemic periodic outbreaks people travel bring countries access enough vaccine many refused want get turned 5g towers whatever heck conspiracy theories spouting. 

Hope another arrow quiver just-in-case said people need boosters road.

Also hope vaccine research leads improved existing vaccines new ones diseases one managed make before. many diseases affect poor can't fund research like malaria money goes treatment people wealthy countries travel, catch it, brin home. less money dedicated prevention effect wealthy countries, least yet. climate change, knows. Bruh way identified 3... amazing many people actually infected. boyfriend sister lived North Dakota two years ago got really sick. taking psych meds, ended locked facility. part state actually pretty close Colorado, thats first moved back N.D. depressing hell see tiny towns boarded houses. town lived decimated went bank get money, knock door. lone employee opened it. atm. grocery stores. Literally like 30 miles away plant packaged beans, hotel stayed at. Every day drive see her. hopelessness run despair. Think, Detroit..with cows. Lots cows  someone young? Yes. we’re talking quality quantity unequivocally yes. can’t lockdown forever ruin prospects youth. vaccinate elderly+at risk restrictions whatsoever. people refuse vaccine live decision. find civil way convey thought, “yeah it’s worrying people one science-based jobs could remarkable terrifyingly anti-science,” let know. Why? COVID vaccinations give herd immunity summer. fans vaccinate olympians world enjoy Skojare ! meant joke. Sort of. Vaccine's concern right bodily autonomy (since they're injected), masks (masks basically clothes). go even farther assume nautical miles! opinion, elderly less important? accept consequences issues (the likely spilled fuel event auto shutoff work), exchange spending minutes outside freezing cold, plus reduced chance exposure COVID. People area generally seem masked refueling, now.  Cuomo propose fine hospitals administer vaccines quickly enough?

edit: point out, we're way 500k day. Still faster, we're closer 1 million day Pssst can’t say things like here, save karma “Looks like gotta nuke Phoenix.”

-Tucson Lol. sound like antivaxer. long swine flu last? West Virginia Mississippi two states require mandatory vaccination school children, exceptions (other medical). surprising; anti-vax nonsense tolerated gotta lock two weeks nbd  Wait I’m Doctor get vaccinated need mask/restrictions. Isn’t vaccination coronavirus? don’t understand use mask would for? link data using? even specific political ideology society. Anywhere communitarian outlook done better comes this.

When comes countries that're dominated liberal individualism main societal ideology, NZ Australia exception complete messes, governments overrode sentiments favour right thing society. flared USA? There's vaccine shows zero evidence causing long term health issues. virus ample evidence could cause long term health issues. afraid former due unknown long term effects, would prefer latter fear short term effects.


Can explain makes sense? That's like saying safer smoke pack cigarettes every day use nicotine gum smoking pack cigarettes kill next Tuesday, know nicotine gum kill 10 years, completely ignoring effects cigarettes 10 years. fundamentally illogical, comparing like like. taking action mitigate problem.

NZ fighting Covid-19 overseas? surprised, *are* awesome. numbers rise overseas, numbers rise hotel quarantine. 

That op's point. 

I - personally - believe fast testing reliable enough, prevent full close air traffic, that's good. wonder many new cases got *on* flight? sub smart  Also Oregon. Kate Brown, Colt Gill Pat Allen frightening triumvirate incompetence this. state politically divided region, Brown done quite job getting sides hate guts. 

I see post r/Portland mentioned national guard activated get rollout expedited. wish they’d commandeer soccer stadium way states have. yet linked peer reviewed medical journal. Standard surgical masks air tight, airborne pathogens easily slip sides. can. Also infected via eyes. 

[This proper PPE medical facilities surgical mask comes airborne pathogens.  Covid deaths exceedingly rare 45, rare 45-60, uncommon way 80 point become serious concern. think someone lower brackets right weigh risk death risk complications vaccine choose get it.

That's ""anti-vaxx"" position. read 50+ page document Pfizer submitted FDA want. words vaccine still trials investigations. believed safe, probably is, decision take vaccine young low-risk individual thought necessarily wacky seeing plateauing till sometimes February Thing they're really struggling make severe currently are.  didn’t claim differently....

I simply said ignored there’s help since live fantasy world. unfortunately, vaccines cure. someone already infected, late help jab. island all, worse comes worst. Yeah tiered approach horrendous. hospital network around 34% 1A group opted get vaccine. Tbh, OP's situation demonstrates clearly genes everything. moral life based also value we're taught 

We probably sum total Punnett square. NY NJ still back another spike despite even higher death rate per capita? Unless it’s case herd immunity lower threshold less densely populated area (which could make sense). 

That bode poorly California would mean far, far longer go get infections control interventions, lockdowns vaccinations. kinda Florida doing? actually know blame. blame? Damn real collapse hope economies get new strain affected vaccine.

some variants/strains may reduced efficacy, unlikely new strain completely unaffected vaccine. targeting full large portion spike protein, vaccines produce multiple types antibodies various parts protein. see massive mutations render completely ineffective. rate covid mutating, large scale mutations likely. Even flu mutates quickly cross-immunity various strains. Plus, 65's vaccinated first dose march second dose rolling 12 weeks after, likely going affect final immunity much.

We also know said mutations would terms virus behaves heavy heavy mutations would make spread faster slower would less deadly. weak nothing. Schedule follow-up! believe numbers coming Cuba China miracle covid cures sell you. Anyone thought post reasonable clearly didn’t see signs listen experts aren’t going back normal ever Interesting pretty much exact opposite prevailing opinion sub. Can't states utilize national guard distribute vaccine? military good one thing logistics. [CDC Weekly Deaths,  care talking about. never claimed country Europe ""really well"" according personal definition ""really well"". claim really well compared situation spring even less restrictions spring, indicates variables play implemented policy. even disagree statement, arguing definition ""really well""? someone whose extended family abroad actually went thru lockdown too, agree. Americans idea ""lockdown"" marketing half-measure. 

We nothing we're ideas. don’t know anyone answer this, currently U.K. lot people sick dying covid, would giving sick patients vaccine early help fight virus? takes 8-10 days immunity develop 14 virus kill. I’m biologist I’ve clue I’m talking Well take long! Lol wish true. sister teacher sending back person classes 19th. know would like NYC. city would collapsed.

Wait see happens LA county. always divert argument too. Like newsom eating French laundry. think hypocrisy disproves science. Incompetence everywhere.. California storing vaccine massive amounts people dying. governors blood hands releasing vaccine? want ride, please. point, gotta vaccinate want shot now. understand 'tier' approach would fine super easy 'one done' minimal cold chain requirements situation, not. Hopefully J&amp;J/Jansen hit park solid signals platform. One dose potentially stable enough simple refrigeration we're golden. need AZ well.... think they’ll fine without truck loads bodies. That’s pretty good return. Nope, all. anyone feel guilty wanting lives back? right happy, blame feel guilty that. No. bet many schools B-117. mask mandate actually enforced though? That’s people thought last year, infections Japan skyrocketing it’s looking unlikely. I'm mistaken caregivers, nurses, ""wasn't more"" done, Japanese government sets things immigration nearly impossible. definitely class issue. One under-analyzed problem callous job market pressures lower class *to act* like normal, quickly leads lower class *believing* normal. 

Monkey see monkey do, want frank. 

While upper class luxury working home lower class pressured act like normal. leads believe normal take critical missteps miscalculations throughout crisis leading higher death tolls (Brown/Black) communities. Narrator: he’s expert still brutal cold gathered Christmas/NYE restrictions. gives? stops people sub giving opinions lol Also there's surprising number wealthy countries ability produce traditional vaccine. keep ranting this, I'll rant again! States set texting system notify people close facility extra doses; first people respond text get confirmation go get shot. Or, could sign hospital site closest house. could done sooooo much smoothly clinics calling random associates, happening now... Canada, USA, individualistic western european countries already smoked.

Anyone championing libertarianism liberal individualism societally point idiot. true, time med student friends, great doctors now, defy wouldn’t wanted rely then.

Plus, never test interlock extends far. Lol, UK couple friends got fined equivalent $270 traveling 5 miles could walk together open space. dates recorded number. accurate far many doses administered time. day day might exact thing happy trend. Herd immunity, least approaching it. Take away tax exemption proper safe ways vaccines developed; almost ignored this.

Sources? seem pretty confident, easy provide. Higher emphasis protection long term care facilities/nursing homes/etc. Distribution n95 masks people since believe specific cloth masks surgical masks effective. problem closing businesses take people’s choice liberty decision away damages people’s financial/emotional well being. ability give small business financial help lockdowns could potentially help. However people naturally going find ways spread virus That’s crazy amount dead people people don’t care It’s funny admits article doesn’t know he’s talking infectious diseases critical care physician, trained make public policy decisions West Virginia putting rest states shame, surprise. logically follow said. high risk profession COVID, I'd take vaccine early. I'm not. I? Cheers answer...shall see months react vaccine seen states/countries, mean herd immunity kicked in.

It's little bit definitional.

It's ""herd immunity"" sense virus can't spread anymore, enough major spreaders gotten virus can't spread easily starts fall off. move Los Angeles September:

1. LA already stadiums, little extra construction required
2. Americans vaccinated then, unlike Japanese screwed scramble vaccines 
3. America would wide open athletes tourists could come go please distrust big pharma

Moderna BioNTech small pharma. Moderna's first mainstream product BioNTech needed Pfizer actually manufacture vaccine them.

This like refusing get Fitbit hate Windows. existence article, subject matter, dystopian. Hesitancy word Countries dominated liberal individualism libertarianism terms societal attitudes cultural trends already lost regard.

It's simple that. worry. zero effect housing market. Home prices go up.

Oh... high unemployment still currently worse 2008 crisis worst point also effect housing market whatsoever.

Move on.... nothing see hear. Everything fine. 

Print Trillions.....

Y'all get Cadillac. Shooting worse plan mean support current vaccine plan. However, I’d say biggest failures currently state governors decided micromanage plan like Cuomo New York. However, you’re unable come better plan, that’s supporting Trump, that’s failing come actual reason blame him. bone marrow transplant cure cancer 2012. wear mask 6 months body recovered. still pissed generous supply better N95 masks public. fact travel plane go crowded places future without N95 mask. stuff cloth masks hyped protect health care workers. Even great smell fresh cut lawn enough mold spores kill someone compromised immune system. Please pre judge continue mask time goes on.   Haha see Umm...Fauci immunologist. last time checked Chuck Schumer disease.  vaccinating 500,000 people per day get us absolutely nowhere, hope haven’t forgotten theres another shot required... Sumo wrestlers count athletes? yes. Otherwise no. rare side effects like allergic reactions they’ve seeing

1-5 100,000 got allergic reaction, 0 died. Still hell lot safer getting covid. I'm probably last group offered this, live NYC WAIT start mass vaccinations. read Brooklyn Bronx starting 24 hour vaccination hubs. I'm excited! I’m getting first dose Moderna week 34 weeks. (I tried like crazy get earlier, best could manage, driving 2 hours way.) I’m still going get it. agree taking ICU beds longer bad thing, also think article poor quality. However clearly pandemic would even worse case fatality rate higher (provided high significantly cut transmission) Approval formality. Sourcing 300 million doses real challenge.  feeling vaccine (if already) black market.
It seems like little way direction controls Last year got sick maybe 3 days. Fever chills. Unfortunately COVID became news time started begin. never able get test well pandemic see antibodies. assume fact COVID? read antibodies last months cant check anymore. need worry long term effects it? pray bad cold. He's expert. He's writing far field kook asserting ""low IFR"" ""low herd immunity threshold"" conspiracies. late 2021 maybe. believe correct response then? _very_ good chance need mask up. vaccine likely reduce spread well, tested seems safer ask people wear mask bit longer know sure. Masking exactly massive sacrifice. seems really stupid. way ''lockdowns'' implemented differs country country. much respected various countries lockdowns partial, strict countries.

Also, one come conclusion less people interacting increased coronavirus cases!? family CA (but live NYC) watching cases explode disbelief...I feel bad medical staff right now. Stay safe!! Yes, second covid? Wait whiners calling ""privileged"" fact remains possible people can't afford work home go work safely securely without spreading virus itself.

The people give shit spreading virus ones make impossible restaurants function safely, instance. They're ones killing service industry, emergency health regulations. starts innocently enough, normal new parent’s concern, friends get hooked hard stuff - Google searches Facebook groups. Clickbait Feel better soon! guys power you. personally think locking entire country mild virus may worse economical societal effect virus itself. Sounds pretty dramatic. It’s working Ontario right =( across world, one listening us industries shut down, saying forever. tell us shut ""be empathetic"". That’s point. four countries mentioned different climates similarly successful. countries could’ve taken approaches didn’t. Perfect opportunity use realization united anagram untied.

Frankly don’t know I’m one good ones think funny way quantifiable, accurate evidence science behind vaccines lockdowns even masks (just it’s harder study.) 

Yet many people refuse take vaccine support scientific recommendations lockdown. I'm sorry lockdown get hard enough welding people homes works you.

People life now. Maybe let go walk maybe enjoy life. certainly helped Rutte government particularly van Dissel, ""leader"" RIVM (health dept), continues even downplay masks ineffective.

Periodically Prime Minister Rutte gives condescending speech blaming Dutch fuckups, lecturing bad behavior refusing much anything.

And yet party, PVD, strongly favored next elections. 

I get it. I've lost great deal respect Netherlands last ten months. Dude bees nose I’m SLC. Tbf don’t know got I’ve super careful am. One can’t guarantee. worry still putting people’s Ives st risk spreading it. selfish evil. Ignorance excuse harm Oh Lordy bot? talk like actual child want people think know jack? Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, Samoa Micronesia lost virus-free status, although none far reported community island nations territories Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Tonga Tuvalu believed still free coronavirus.

Could worse guess. I've following situation island nations little. Many managed countain it. always go wrong though. Seychelles hat several outbreaks managed countain, one year last one proven difficult. hope pacific islands hold long enough vaccine reach them.  I’m sorry causing much unnecessary panic virus social media insane.

I feeling people absolutely 0 idea lockdowns private life restricted extent. certainly youth young adults dieing it. every Covid Case 99% mild symptomps. mention many asymptomatic people running around currently. 97% cases minus thecurrently active cases recovered already.

I see many people Twitter trying convince others normal recovery Covid exception even tho not. likely outcome. source point one guy still problems breathing months afterwards. point many cases preety much asyptomatic get called irresponsible liar. 

As I, 21 year old healthy dude, restrict life minimum virus 99% survival rate. protect parents grandparents. us extend limits health system. soon everyone risk country got vaccine got offered one damn sure extent anymore.

Everyone thinks supposed long term stuff happens quarantine till 2024. really care. could’ve nation earth, instead... wonder refer ‘God’s chosen people’ lol [already must know don’t know 22 mutations effect current vaccine  main issue causing lackluster response worldwide, lack clarity, CONSTANT goalpost moving.
Fine, get everything needs closed right cases spiking. case vaccination efforts fucking slow?

Ramping production distribution vaccines needs top priority, Literally nothing else matters. pace (most) countries vaccinating appalling urge look science vaccine works (and compare vaccines). Also look evidence medical trials. help form informed opinion “Your models”
What?

I don’t really care claims are. random internet person every incentive lie here. 

Your original comment shows zero concept talking about. worse, zero willingness even fathom might talking butt.

The scientists Chinese vaccine haven’t even posted data online make accessible outside experts scrutinise. Even data experiments Turkey Brazil seemed rather pay vaccine Europe/USA (though AstraZeneca much cheaper). They've cases like that. Hey don’t sound smart either I've least two friends literally die street due poverty. One died exposure. Exposure! (Had known. :-/) Thank support Depends upon billed. CMS-center medicare medicaid services (most insurances follow gudelines) allows office visit codes billed testing. Even drives site saliva test monitored giving saliva. 

If office billed insurance deductible office visit apply deductible.

Edit: provide cms stands Wait it, 6 months later US cdc ""study finds patients still show signs ‘long Covid’ 6 months later"" Something Book Mormon.

Glad symptoms quite severe West Virginia directly control flow vaccines long-term care facilities. smaller operation adapt switch gears, states must navigate bureaucracy huge national chains. good chuckle one read comments article. Really ramps blood pressure. 

One comment: *""Okay, let's conduct fewer tests bring meaningless number down.""*

Why sound familier?

Another person: one slightest clue number ""active cases"".  virus people even know had. 
  agree downside.  Especially since known hospitalizations attributed way deaths are:  matter actually - appendix, cancer, toothache - test positive Covid. 

Just wow! [Here go. time, they're examining mutation one one. Got second Pfizer yesterday 1015. 

Could sleep. Sweats. Aches wazoo. 

But planned zero day. 
Ibuprofen friend- takes edge off. 

Hopefully better morning- hate call symptoms SUPPOSED happen . Wear mask think sick. Asian countries it. enforceable exactly I’m thinking too. People weirdly peace world control...it’s almost like want stay way odd. Covid done yet. it’s different flu! /s website goes live Monday 4pm EST NYers register think. Sure did.  Well, might change mind everyone else around gets vaccinated returns normal. funny often people change mind comes actually holdout. find can’t everything want, everyone stares them. personal predictions. 

Large events/crowded places? Outdoor gatherings probably return late summer masks half capacity, social distance want eat drink outside household. 

Indoor gatherings, they’ll probably wait 2022, indoor dining remain viewed risky activity entirety 2021. 

Unrestricted international travel? Probably earliest Mid-2022. new Covid variants popping countries, wouldn’t count countries lifting 14 day quarantine rules anytime soon. 

Masks? think they’ll kind middle ground. won’t go away 100% won’t government mandated 24/7 forever. 

They’ll definitely stick around healthcare workers, possibly professions work food, like waiters/chefs, Spring 2022, think you’ll legally allowed go without lot people drop without second thought soon happens. Nazis largely would happened. specter communism one main reasons Nazi rise power (in addition hyperinflation, versailles, depression). 

Germany would military dictatorship. DNVP backed dictatorship probably would restored Kaiser (albeit figurehead). expansion would limited past imperial territories.  Go read Kapp Putsch.

Past immediate consequences, difficult ascertain would happened. things listed well could happened conflict different nation. New Deal driven fear Soviets, also fear losing election Huey Long nothing done. say ""x, z never would happened"" silly way looking it. know certainty would played out.

Communism cancer i'm proud say ancestors fought Baron Pyotr Vrangl's Army Group South Russian Civil War. Vrangl won, holocaust (that killed many ancestors emigrate) would probably happened per fact pattern above. deal tankies today, world would seen 100+ million deaths failed ideology. Facebook helped cause deaths vaccine period. 
 It’s like pissed drunk teenagers aren’t still driving around heard shit going see, crashed.  
 That’s Facebooks fault, AOL IM wasn’t fault either stupid shit planned high school.
 However certainly haven’t done enough stop disinformation. used work autistic clients months, hardest job I’ve ever physically emotionally. left felt couldn’t long term provide comfort future clients families. 
 It’s fucking insane anyone decide someone else’s intentions preventative vaccination. 
 hope things work well, really tough situation in, obviously care. 
 wow relative sucks. can, don’t ever loose altruism. Good luck. Sucks one nuts report her. Maybe people started getting fines traveling without quarantining following state guidelines, would think twice it. important question find baffling full YEAR we’re still looking answers. Baffling. 

 mean EASY study right??

 couple -hundred- vaccines making approved full scale inoculation one knows safe unsafe place could be? able go roof outdoor locations? cold parts outdoors may work law allowed exception bunch buddies med school went military, guess technically military really, definitely now.

Took shooting, wasn’t pretty. Damn near safety hazard. Smart guys, way smarter I, I’m pretty sure trips range took years life. Kids quarantined years vaccine ready them. understand would pretty dumb listen everything anyone said said ""I'm expert, trust me"", right? 

I'm willing ""listen expertise"", prove expertise. Obviously. seems virus nature general really care humanity year numbers, they?  Let's both. sure. NYC planning 845 locations administer vaccine 245 currently active. NYC densely populated might think need central locations planning lot.

To kind like voting. theoretically go across town vote likely near by. 1200 polling locations around NYC sounds similar. late me... I’ve turned evil plotting revenge. Yeah! 'government' dictate life!!

It'll go back corporations, student loan lenders health insurance companies dictate life! much larger population Moderna partnerships NIAID Lonza. Oh yeah, neck deep fighting CoVID19 home front, definite downside letting thing spread throughout country. countries do, that's problem. Olympics bring together people meager means endless budgets. Yeah father Florida. 65 comorbidities, getting vaccine tomorrow. Maybe better South try many rules around it. Maybe less people willing take vaccine due misinformation. I'm Alabama personally think general availability end March really want it. Public health comes first. That’s say people want see businesses shut down, we’re pandemic. You’re one who’s lost things fire, speak. didn’t shit down. didn’t situation pick economy lives. Bad leadership brought us here. Defiant citizens brought us here. Misinformation brought us here. It’s loaded issue, unregulated pandemic, already in, dire consequences. done right thing beginning. know blame here. Seems long way off... Hopefully, get great news J&amp;J single shot vaccine approved weeks... Well one thing they're tune. vaccines eliminated 100% hospitalizations deaths. 95% figure getting symptoms Unfortunately ppl still say numbers fabricated. proof shown, bury heads sand. supply vaccine keeps up, see ramping pretty quick. New York State started 50 places get vaccine 650 goal 3700.

Other states starting use stadiums large public spaces. would surprise see states double triple output within week two long actually get vaccine.

I reading different reports sounds like federal government withholding doses case interruption manufacturing distribution. could lot 22 million doses available. Biden said let loose. happens combined 2-4 times many places get shot, think see big increase. law. Thank Like....concentration camps? Thats frowned upon days brainstorm little harder guess people begin feel insecure ignorance surfaces. Seems wrong. Isn’t survival rate way higher COVID advanced cancer? know depends seems cancer patients risk average... Yea, make sense. can't caught vaccine available them. Schools require student get vaccine approved them. think may delay schools opening extremely risk adverse area much country back school school year certainly next year. die, money still released another party. Also, entire time money sitting retirement portfolio, active. say economic cost losing life someone past retirement age losing life someone 30s intellectually dishonest forcing data fit narrative.  psycho. OP meant unrestricted, assume without quarantines show proof vaccination. course go anywhere right jump hoops anything. active duty ones kind hands full facilities. Regimes generally better position handle pandemic compared democracy. Unfortunately western media praises countries like Germany New Zealand ignoring non democratic countries way handled it. 55% men died Covid vs 45% women. men ended ICU.

 Yes but. 1/3 deaths would happened regardless covid. countries include numbers. 


Belgium exactly shine given high population density central location, probably managed avoid worse. Pity say that, right?

But saying anyone believed back would possible Olympic Games 2021, still course happen, idiot, totally exaggeration. I'll take guess sometime February. likely least 5% population 2nd week vaccine then. probably start looking like much, blip data cannot directly attribute vaccine. slowly build obvious.  Others agree, I'm right. I'm sick nice Since Covid meds come mail. saved lots money going drugstore several times month. actually believe people listen trying appear they’re something? whole country?

The vaccine stimulates immune system generates inflammatory response different different people. think big reaction means great immune system vice versa anything like that. case, perfect really enemy effectiveness. Vile. Ya realize ventilators weren’t thing 100 years ago? people were/are ICU would stand chance back then. Along large number hospitalized people too, medications used treat symptoms. Medical care indeed relevant. I'll say one thing shortness breath.

From I've read, rare shortness breath isolated COVID symptom.

I felt shortness breath lot early pandemic worried COVID (this tests widely available). talked doctor reality, partly psychosomatic (which fancy word means ""your brain broken"") partly shape staying home rarely leaving. groceries store open go elsewhere afterwards, lesser lot amount contacts peoples.

Nothings deadly mutated version spanish flu. first similar Flu, much like people trying point Covid. mutated killed 50 million people despite age health conditions. Especially children 10. Stopping spread preventing people dying, preventing mutation could end immune vaccines much deadly. tired hearing done NYC healthcare workers emergency responders free go full court press vaccinating people.

The Army Navy able put weight single city.

And vaccine distributing many years? local news L.A. showed clip nurse livestreaming code blue patient ended dying. surreal. able fine lockdowns. Lockdowns new circumstance.

I get people vulnerable there. time, solution ""shut society everyone indefinitely."" vulnerable take steps protect themselves, force rest society shut them. Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money oh Money Source? says No/we know yet. Can’t wait see various “empty hospitals” groups FB react this. leadership coordinated strategy. federal government basically told states figure states basically told hospitals figure out, parameters.

The clusterfuck entirely predictable. also prevents spread Here's hoping. think addition vaccines approved ideally speed timeline, people Washington usually approving governor's handling pandemic pretty upset December thrown around. 

We'll see. genuine strategy, parts world selfish allow work. 

It eradicated could been. We’re track mostly back normal June/July. led believe December. cheap readily available; small large animal wormer. believe used extensively India Covid treatment. said poor man's Remdisiver. may well cancel it. way crowds hundreds thousands hundreds thousands happening probably 2023/2024. countries aren’t even getting vaccine 2022 bad Maybe North Dakota think using local pharmacies understand need prioritize I'm glad opening next phase, also make list ""stand-by"" patients. patients may eligible yet, readily available accept surplus shots.

For example, Moderna vial contains 10 doses. give 3 doses eligible recipients, list local potential recipients call can't find enough people take remaining 7 doses vial. Last week, clinics leftover doses end day ended discarding find anyone fit eligibility criteria. Many vaccination sites also lot time no-shows unfilled registration spots. friends showed earlier appointment times able get vaccine immediately, means appointment times empty.

Meanwhile, in-laws retired, available eager get vaccine, yet eligible. local stand-by list. ... ... Jesus wants people get COVID die? exactly logic dude? yeah america ""too poor"" technologically advanced enough. Sure that's it. Thanks. Hopefully closer May December Oh yeah, I'm joking, can't give blood either. Crazy people forget. states essential workers aka grocery store cashiers old people keep waiting. Idiotic. arguing weeks ago people said good idea. Well started ""two weeks slow spread"" ended random rule making clear goal, strategy timeline almost year later people's lives work get flushed toilet governor going fancy wine parties can't even bother put mask on. expect?? Maybe give people real plan that's logical makes sense people listen. 10 months there's end sight. People getting fed I'm that. cities form noncontinuous country enter free trade agreement rural states America.  That's irrelevant determining lockdowns work not. travel horse 3 days find someone cough live North Dakota? article ton word count boils — vaccinated people feel comfortable around vaccinated people risk around unvaccinated people. Trump barely showing job. exposes abandoned duties nothing change Biden sworn in. turbulence next 10 days. hardly call superspreader events. 🙏🏻 ""lockdown"", people still like normal, nothing like happened earlier last year streets go quiet. large percent people wearing masks even though uk gone shit creek last month.

parents telling plenty places still open naming ""essential"", relatively normal amount cars road, parks busy. government need stop pussyfooting around get things control. Kinda wish knew deleted comment said!!! made offensive Holocaust joke. act surprised. don’t know. think girlfriend can’t feel mood spends day everyday pajamas working home. Doesn’t make feel good herself/confident. apart mental health right great open restaurants tomorrow fucking brilliance /s vaccine specifically tested help fight virus. prevent getting it, prevents getting sick it. possible make less contagious, unclear affect spread. Tomorrow, everyone 75 older eligible shot NY.

Loads states already administering age categories top career progressions.

I feel like complaints still running around news sources old complaints.

And I'm reading article literally says Gottlieb said last week.

So, lol, yeah, actually old complaint recycled. Howsabout mad, Black Friday dash local Walgreens? Wait til find God put virus earth specifically weed selfish, willingly would kill elderly parents others, love neighbors. really see pandemic would affect couples' intimacy unless unable meet due lockdowns, affected gf slightest...but also japan life barely changed here. Really reaching shot make “America bad” comment karma.   China doesn’t count. lock citizens away however please. Lol, that's trillion $ question hundreds, thousands people probably ask talk website everyday. 

That's political social decision, necessarily medical one. Gallup research US shows pretty steep drop people's willingness comply w/ Pandemic life restrictions, indicates people becoming ""fatigued"". vaccinations go up, Biden plans light fire it, fatigue goes up, pressure throughout year return typical travel, social life, etc. 

It seems relative consensus sub, elsewhere news whatever, things look much 2019 familiar summer months year. lacking civility? asked valid question. That’s problem COVID fatigue, percentage population willing adhere strict lockdown continues decline....and significantly earlier lockdowns. Alright comments harsh shit, I’m sorry hate covid, basically summarize herd immunity =/= normal people Whenever teachers mentioned specify kind teacher. ""Teacher"" could mean grade school teacher, high school, professor, lecturer, heck could even mean driving instructor. wish would specify.  Tokyo bid olympics get financial return junior high track meet  Sssh. They're hoping people go 3 million. death rate high. contact tracing effective? Middle East entered chat. get paid chocolate Gotcha. ramp Monday Friday pretty dramatic. Nasty Guard? Logistics? Sounds like never military. vaccinations gonna start pick steam vaccine candidates get approved soon well. feel like general population could start getting vaccinated April goes well, let’s see happens. I've said before. perverse reason US wants remain covid hell. absolutely interest desire bring end. I'm sure reasons this, would probably realm conspiracy theories. fun follow 3 weeks get everyone second dose I'd hate see affordable living Tokyo go price People get cushy jobs high things like given job friend family member. it’s put shitty hospital admins know FuckAll.  state isn’t included? lol thanks. fixed it. really. 

1. People studied mobility data Google mobility line increases/decreases case counts.

2. Case counts fallen way 18% ND. They're literally 80% peak. I'd love see mobility data cite, can't believe looks anything like ND's case graph.

3. Cases ND look like entire rest Midwest. takes incredibly suspension disbelief think mobility data states different Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota Colorado tracks different California, Texas Florida. individual countries ‘Scotland’ aren’t see mainland Great Britain, also includes islands like Skye coast. ‘UK’ Eng, Sco Wal includes thousands offshore islands.

There single island overwhelming majority live, isnt called ‘UK’ either politically geographically, called Great Britain.  many rules top far people work giving shots lead bad results. $1 million fine ridiculous. dumb comment. That's bit stretch, that's coming someone who's using words like ""terrorist"" since Wednesday Idk im dumb like...as people get vaccinated amount people get spread goes down?? whole point vaccines? signals could far infected tests currently showing. Last week met friend seen long time. wearing mask. thing told like this, “I laid boss stupid, guys wearing masks? requirement? one told mask required. know, perfectly ok 3 million Americans die per year, more...” walked away point. walked away. people apathy people dying? 

Just vent feeling. Close end like US.
Next thing domestic terrorists. forgot say previous response. really appreciate thoughtful explanation.  can’t help man think said April full normal lol masks sight? Probably near future. always small percentage population chooses wear masks this. 

I remember back college 2014, really bad flu season 2013-2014 season. students, professors paranoid getting flu, saw wearing masks. remember thinking crazy seemed, people would give confused stares. 

Oh, knew... fact secretary dealt reasons, arrested 21 December corruption

However, city trouble coping without mayor quickly promoted acting mayor can’t blame teachers getting them, they’re baby sitters many Back April, saying vaccine least year away. Hindsight sight back then, got lucky came early. Biden coming, open!

- Cuomo, probably I'd shitty attitude things happened tooo Completely agree. point masks alone end-all be-all solution, counter-productive keep focusing anti-maskers much pieces puzzle. haven’t grandma’s tamales. They’re... underwhelming.  

My sister made quest tamale game family point last month. Spanish people? guess people US English people event sincere, relevance someone lives slightly less 6 months year gets sick time counted among Florida's numbers, despite infected useful metric evaluate spread. therefore undercounting.

As ""a lot"", estimates put second home ownership Florida around 15% -- itself, interestingly, undercount, census differences ""second"" home ""investment"" home.

tl;dr Florida's population grows substantially winter people counted among COVID-19 cases state.  Agreed. point 24/7 IMO Spring better now; summer even better spring fall even better summer. We’re almost “finish line” 7k Trump got put office. article also doesn’t mention credible information attack Washington monument. really sure 10k number coming from. Yes. Soon. Oh, bad. edited. remember next CDC posts. think vaccine approved? randomly decided approve it? No. They’ve testing people since July. we've actually got 50m doses, 25m shipped 9m used? Tamales Molé 😍 already one that's turning 21. supposed temporary gig leave. sure, not? room! There's nothing implies [CDC distributed cumulative counts COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded shipped Centers Disease Control Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) since December 13, 2020.

Seems like reporting first doses distributed, would included information there, instead saying ""cumulative counts."" Stop it! Tengo hambre abuela longer make enchiladas. Except realize many new flu type viruses originate Asia, Wuhan hit worse way Italy was. okay. Learning TikTok dances takes effort! long take time, rush Yeah cause terrorists trying take country steal election. tried get Trump send national guard said Pence it... basically invoke 25th amendment could get national guard... stopped listening Trump still know he's gonna say something stupid. Biden power right literally can't anything... is, little evidence doesn't. point research needed company assumes safe. 

Ironically still wipe surfaces use. use logic, understand really curious Tamales I'm spot canada around 0 authentic mexican food, decided look wikipedia Tamale is. Turns originated mesoamerica like 5000 8000 B.C Maya Aztec people used easy portable hunting food. want try one even more, they're good people rocking since 5000 BC  I'd expect lack ""backend"" work would make vaccinations easier. Like get swab nose, there's bunch work needs done finish test. vaccine, wait doses. That’s what’s happening, guarantee hospitals already reserving second doses stock hand. trust feds get second doses time gun shy. let hospitals reserving, know 100 percent second doses hand?  According CDC we're closer 10 fucked I?

Really hard say. friends spouses covid, tested negative multiple times symptoms living/working/sleeping together. Try stress wait five days go get tested advice give you. Cuomo one many governors deserve lost bid seek re-election mess. 

We could cusp nearing end this, many governors idea fuck doing, comes vaccine distribution point fucking first come first server anyone better plan priority groups. Everyone, singular tamales tamal, tamale. tamal tamale, singular tamal plural tamales Hospital laundry outsourced third party industrial launderers. touched bare hands. Thanks thanks, eating that. know you, matter, person took picture been, often wash hands etc.

Not rude, got I'm trusting something made bare hands contacted since then. going mouth circumstances. gettin see anybody claiming is. think line quote trying preempt ideas sex workers inherently home-wrecking agents Satan. distribution vaccines strange indeed. relative mine doctor rural area well prepared covid got vaccines. said get vaccine container need use remaining doses (maybe like 4 doses per container sounded like?) amount time, they’ll pull people street offer comes would otherwise wasted. want get community fast possible, difficult rural area. Put trial! globally though country specific? globally yes unlikely we'll reach herd immunity especially poorer countries. wealthier nations like US/Canada European countries etc hopefully reach herd immunity latest end year return normality. pretty much enough vaccine doses ordered simply matter fast doses delivered people's arms. tbh think things start improve significantly summer latest since imagine US etc example vulnerable elderly vaccinated point rest population generally lower risk left Los tamales guatemaltecos Mexican tamales south Mexico jackass  Damn bet fire too. Homemade tamales fucking good. what's vaccination rate per day right now? commented comment. 

Not top level comment.

The word ""doses"" also appear context ""first doses"" title (as CDC data specify first doses distributed), talking title. many vaccinations currently USA? Nice. Could please send pandemic preparedness guide EVERYWHERE ELSE. think back normal time ever ? guess may require proof inoculation... called “vaccine-passport”, least while. I’ll happy present it, need types events again. Thanks - 2nd language - fixed ;) Yes boomed many places summer, including southern US especially warm. think slowed summer Europe first big lockdown severe came heels Italy European countries really suffering people took seriously. basically saying Chinese ethnicity guilty relations, that's racist

Just like Chinese blaming blacks spread COVID-19 beginning outbreak, quarantined hotels evidence, took passports? 
 
You know funny Chinese crying racism they're better. fact, Chinese people probably one racist people know encountered. hey, feel free act victim. CVS &amp; Walgreens dragging feet part rural Eastern Washington. 

CVS, state contract vaccinate nursing home residents, even planning begin vaccinations mid-February. Luckily, local hospital local MD stepped vaccinated nursing home residents past couple weeks.  There's doubt literally saved lives so. 

I really think public/private partnerships going key successful vaccine administration, need come strict timetables, accountability fallback options timetables met. COVID long term effects vaccines....don't. 

That's science works. make theory: COVID vaccine safe long term b c e. try disprove it. can't, know. science works. Cedar Sinai Los Angeles. guarantee have. volunteered there, staff appreciates stuff like much. using sex get whats change - regular hours now?  comment comment, top level comment.

I feel like show I'm referring to. think CDC site they're listing first dose distribution. They've sent know they're reporting it. wasn’t planned...sort of. buddy’s wife found could hard conceive stopped trying let fate play part. 

They foresight reschedule early pandemic found pregnant. 

My friend, hand, still thinks international wedding happening summer.  UK week latest national lockdown (with various restrictions added week that, today two-week low COVID cases. early feel slightly optimistic things may starting improve next couple weeks, lockdown may actually able start eased March originally planned? Yeah I’m nervous since go liberal college gonna make us act like there’s pandemic 2022 2023 let anyone party even vaccinated cus lol. Right obviously I’m glad rules kinda strict but.. 2nd doses. likely already received 2nd dose. hope could accept them, sure protocol would accepting food hospital outdoor dining considered safe summer fall, it’s safe now. never prohibited first place. Everything that's allocated far exclusively first doses.

Well can't possibly true know people getting second doses already. That’s crazy, looking for...thanks. Again, purely curiosity since know everyone’s getting tested even seeks testing even symptomatic suspect, seemingly right, thinking numbers far exceeding what’s reporting great herd immunity standpoint— CFR standpoint too, although similarly feel deaths underreported....which might piss ppl hear say considering people already say “oh got hit car?! Must’ve covid killed him!” shit like that. hopefully use lot stadiums around country this..I would like 65+ vaccinated USA next month should. need hit 2.5M day keep phizer moderna supply. mention JnJ. goal supply bottleneck distribution administration. could looking J&amp;J rolled end February then? would great. 1 dose vaccine feel hopefully speed things quite significantly need ti vaccinate person twice unlike vaccines Ah Brazilians fighting corona like men Yes succeed can’t manufacture many times more? There's listed - understand since COVID well known cause [autoimmune risk higher here. spike protein indeed resembles body's tissues, mere act COVID antibodies could increase autoimmunity. Canadian? able cross I’ll take doubt 700 Give rest. want circle Aug 1 calendar right now? would reckless it’s never going happen. “Some random event” whatever helps sleep night chinese boot licker. Also im fromthe usa, im indifferent insults aimed towards I'm 11 months first getting it.
Still issues breathing. 
It sucks.
Stay safe. can't. change title post taken don’t know shared yet want edit Reuters title know allowed mods.  think sending guard someone else DC day? damn long? feel like point risk low enough it’s completely ridiculous. think virtue signaling people think reason (flu season even sick) make us keep wearing Important note can't fully compare tests vaccines since covid vaccines two shots(J&amp;J hopefully 1 shot) mean need vaccinated twice may slightly slow things down. I'd say predictions seems realistic part. could get testing significantly ramped reason can't vaccines providing supply time ... everyone died dysentery. Grandma playing Oregon Trail... long game. lead-up nerve-wracking actual side effects (haven’t got second dose yet).

Whatever happens it’s gone 2 days vaccinated!!!!! Huge weight shoulders worst 48 hour cold. Good trade-off IMO. really adding ""first"" front word doses.

People click link know CDC reporting total doses, first doses realize full picture doses.  fair bible contradictive universal right interpretation. /another atheist That’s awesome! 3 days. like 700k per day vaccine jabs given people given vaccine? really paid attention vaccine news, I'm kinda clueless. IIRC, tamale man opened restaurant, got covid. believe go fund helped medical bills keeping restaurant alive mandatory shut down. No, Chicago that's Tamale Guy. one dude. Used see Guthrie's (RIP favorite bar) regularly. year petition stop business, Go Fund response gave enough money open restaurant, caught COVID suspending business right started, think things finally stabilizing. wild ride Tamale Guy. 

I spent 2020 living Bay Area buck wild - brought Tamale Guy drunk party one night like February, spent rest year tracking amazing journey headlines. Yay! place hard get Nope. three necessary order stop spread.  serology testing indicate anything herd immunity. typical trough wave seen nearly every state/country. We'll probably million per day end month. Hopefully 2m/day end February.

Might 3m/day range July. ruthless. children elders paticipated Chinese vaccine trials. mean seems picked significantly lately  Thank heavens universal health care. Wait. Bilkent University? Unlikely herd immunity. serological testing showed 1442 13395 samples tested would 10.7%. 12.4% state tested positive PCR. But, large wave, 25% state tested average twice PCR. total, around half state tested one point time. 

What North Dakota likely seen every state/country gone wave. wave peaks subsides. seen states/countries, mean herd immunity kicked in. highest death rate world, knowing think lockdowns work? told MD checked shot taking Tylenol fine. You’ll get whole packet info, don’t worry. That's ""my body choice"" argument work here. personal choice. choices effect everyone else comes infectious disease. Especially good friend chrones. Id take precautions hanging him/her Speakers Native languages US getting priority vaccines. anyone know going elsewhere world? 

There ton languages dying; still know elderly. think priority vaccinate people speak them. UN step make happen. Hospice nurse comes home well. home visit generally, doctors travel private homes people afford pay them. aware insurance paying it. Sounds like UK much different compare US. US choices local doctor office, urgent care ER That's Texas, secede already ffs rest us civilized country without redneck science deniers. neither once. black white duality dependent shot shot.

If within 5% effective mounting immune response - protecting others.

If within 95% mount response - may may protecting others. likely break strong circulating antibody titter personally produce long response is.

And even 100% protecting others - may shedding virus at, let's say, 10% normal shedding rate - even though protecting everyone 100%, still limiting damage.

The world black white. gosh darn patience. Unless vaccine distribution streamlined picks pace new administration takes office, I’m seriously losing hope form normal life resurfacing US 2021. 

My parents also keep trying guilt trip call selfish wanting normal life back. mom also healthcare worker, can’t really argue this. long-haulers? possibility that, 9 10 months nonstop trips fear well, every cough, sniffle, runny nose, instance tired attributed scared paranoid COVID?  study concluded, yes. pharmacies administering 1B doses states? sure. understand. situation control since December, much UK, Germany Holland, yes think working. aIrpLaNeS gO fAr post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really think much better place then! think biggest thing may still mask wearing people may still nervous attend big events. think event safely though likely doable. Mmm true. Maybe due new variant. per capita 7 day average deaths barely lower USA whole. difference cannot big due supply. flu vaccine can't created thin air - orders winter placed anyone ever heard covid late significantly increase manufacturing. remember exact numbers, Czech Republic, normally low vaccination rate, single digit percent maximum obtainable vaccine year supposed allow 10-something percent best, even people wanted (which doubt people insanely antivax reason). Florida give healthcare workers first, first publicly available appointments saw started last week. issue many hospitals/nursing homes workers willing actually get vaccine. I've also several 65+ folks turn offer getting vaccine appointment. 

Arizona taking similar approach NY. opened morning batch people. Indiana cutoff 80+ opened appointments last week. Lol call cooperating? one year? joke. Ah, natural selection working usual going come contact lot people normally contact, transit airport, lines security, baggage claim, check in, boarding, etc, well plane. 

Circulated air planes, measures mask wearing, significantly reduce risks air travel. entire trip start finish certainly carries risk.

Another thing consider that, generally speaking, people travelling right are, average, take COVID less seriously (as others staying home unless absolutely necessary). Therefore would expect people airports somewhat likely average asymptomatic case COVID compared general population, engaging somewhat risky behavior like flying probably correlated engaging risky behavior. Covid given people want stay home time anyway great way live literal dream pretending making huge sacrifices feel morally superior others.

Fuck lockdowns. Wear mask, wash hands distance strangers public spaces otherwise keep living vaguely normal life. nothing going stop America reopening.

Hopefully CDC add second dose data sooner rather later. agree United States, that's par course decade asian countries. lived Colorado someone used sell tamales trunk yellow VW bug. week everytime saw him, would pull grab lunch. best tamales we've ever had. course. know travel bans racist, right? Even travel bans use travel history criteria ethnicity. Vaccinations might work. It’s best case scenario. would think policy would make test positive rate go up. Less people getting tested symptoms.

I still think metric BS compared hospitalizations deaths.The denominator greatly influenced test cost availability. Well, we’re United right now, so... Today me, tomorrow you. really understand downvoted. seems like entire thread brigaded COVID deniers reject comment glowingly positive future COVID magically go away month, like supposed month January 2020. need go away. need controlled mass vaccinations. summer. tell us exact numbers are? simple grasp trace back evolution virus sequencing samples collect. 

They already ideas animals might hosts.

I’m sure it’s complicated. amazing. even knew virus wasn’t going problem year ago didn’t recommend stopping travel. That's incredibly selfish, albeit American way thinking it. important. 82 year old mum we’re support bubble us would reliable access medical care support well company. ?????  like internet explorer meme. I’m sure years time they’ll tell us take vitamin D. would probably significant decrease infections summer even without vaccines anyways, people tend socially gather outside summer, infection risks lower. says right there
 
Total Number People Initiating Vaccination (1st Dose Received) Lots Mass license plates skiing slopes Vermont. like cut jib. upvote. J&amp;J (and hopefully AZ) vaccination doses hitting 2m sooner rather later. point end July seems like pessimistic scenario. Yes, unless there's huge spike infections post-Christmas, ~1% (possibly less) higher ~36% Dec 26. Wrong.

They're landing Thursday. 

The really amazing. able reach conclusion *before even began investigation*. That's sort scrying need avoid problems future!  California won’t able say long, cases deaths breaking peak numbers every day there. Caring mental health 2019 [archive link anyone trouble accessing article believe Nordic model. Yeah, know Covid vaccine wouldn’t effect flu virus, mean flu strains limited spread year due social distancing, masks, etc... maybe strains could die out? complex humans forever.

Masks everywhere forever going happen. do, however, hope experience hopefully change general societal behavior going around sick work / school / shopping / etc., awareness handwashing practices, perhaps people wearing masks outside minor cold / etc. symptoms. Along things like better protection sick leave people afford skip work sick, rather coming spreading cold / flu / COVID 2024 rest office.

There lot evidence suggest things (without massive closures required COVID) prevent lot cold/flu infections every year, equals huge productivity bonuses economy fewer people missing work, significantly decreased healthcare costs, fewer deaths. anyone right comment post, you. Thanks - keep note Yup, live next one big colleges here. wild see many maskless people seemed popped school opened again. Can't wait see bars downtown kids back town  Countries Australia New Zealand achieve year small populations have. Agreed. course case, pepper spray would better option. lot things crazy US since last year!

Epidemiological analysis put IFR less 0.7% official death count ~372k (and actual number likely [30-40% means absolute minimum 53M infections 16%.

I think Youyang Gu cautious refuses use excess deaths data. that's case, [91M infections estimate probably closer reality. Man I'm glad got LA asap. could thank paying bill Floriduhhh-oh talking about? trials vaccines normally take 2 years. case, trials lasted six months. understandable it, support decision. However, cannot infer since significant autoimmunity detected six months two year mark. 

I take vaccine, around six months. also hope able pick kind least side effects based published research time. sounds logical me. goalpost move again. Seriously... best friend caught covid four months ago starting experience difficulty breathing(due reduced lung function), brain fog, fatigue daily. he's 26! man get right...but think ever want social distance I'm really curious mixing doses. Like, second shot booster, even matter one is? Like, say get AZ first, worried boost response dampened vector resistance, give Moderna/Pfizer second doses, right? way around, since antibodies spike present mRNA shot, vector resistance issue. substantial 200kish drop sunday. 

This week needs change. need least 700k/day. course newer data shown first vaccination doses started hitting 1 million per day today, 80% people US ages 16+ would vaccinated end July.

A large chunk population sixteen another unfortunate chunk reject vaccine, we're actually looking vaccinate 330 million people. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article People minimizing horrible effects lockdown isolation arguments would maybe made sense April. get it. prob cause people wearing masks social distancing last year record low flu case. know woman whose shingles outbreak included genital rectal areas. Excruciating, torturous hell Earth. Get vaccinated already, folks. [Here's picture working class Gender Studies graduates hand real work. Similar Munich Exactly, highest saw around 700k, hovering 380k Flu vaccination rates way up. referencing OPs claim 50%. agree number seems wayyyy high. 15000 fans stadium titans/ravens NFL game week. Mask protocols still. gonna put another summer cancellations.

You know what's expensive show first place? Putting time, resources, money planning one, told municipality can't hold event. likely scenario summer events even get planned first place, fear losing lot money cancellations. 

I hope I'm wrong though, really do. source?

Using formula (R0-1)/R0, R0 coronavirus would 5 require 80% immunity. remember seen anyone suggesting R0 higher 3.5 CDC's Youyang Gu's numbers pretty big: 80-91M Americans infected already. there's nothing saying stop either. almost certain reach roughly third US population over.

And there's need argue 2-5 ranges already data showing within much tighter range. want sit doctors waiting room, though. Wow guys opened pubs December, catholic Ireland?! learning conjoined triangles success 

http://conjoinedtriangles.com/ Aye, this.

You can't keep people stressed paranoid year snap fingers suddenly things go back normal.

Things going ugly long time. Ah ok, makes sense. first recollection panic attack 6 7 processed idea heaven eternity.   Decline Western civilization. People travelling. MBA, we're talking low-IQ person here.

LMAOOOOOO cannot believe said presumably straight face Definitely new naming convection needed road. Almost wonder new names scare people take action wear masks... Like: 

The Devastator.
Erection Killer.
Life Destroyer.
Non-Stop Cough &amp; Pee.
Taste &amp; Smell Smasher. Young apes monkeys often taken adults killed, sold pet trade via markets could serve breeding ground virus. Fauci never said fully return normal (maskless packed cinemas), said they'll open. factually correct.

The thing is, even without Government restrictions, many people still choose go cinema go might choose wear mask even required.

It long time cinemas packed nobody wears mask tho.

Live let live, one forcing go cinema. Well hopefully talk sense people like Cuomo fining hospitals 1,000,000 dollars give someone priority group, least going someone rather sitting freezer. Poe’s law  asking part healthcare worker get vaccine ahead people? are, there’s analogy putting oxygen mask first save another person comes mind. Definitely J&amp;J, finished US enrollment first, Slaoui predicted February EUA J&amp;J April EUA AZ.

Only scenario AZ comes first J&amp;J trial results bust vaccine approved. FDA decides accept results UK trial, would huge about-face them. man, confirm walking dumpster fire everyone else around Fun fact: Year 0 exist, goes directly 1BC 1AD.  guess 20%-30% total population infected Good luck, Comrades! I'd expect local concert venues survived open mid summer. dingy, one band, one van tours start first. PAX Easts penciled June 2021. Also work industry, freelance locally instead touring. Article state reason increase.

VT still mandatory quarantine anyone entering/returning cautious visitors though see lots plates NH/ME. Thanks gave hope  Wow! What's throughput vaccinations per day stadium? Healthcare workers getting COVID bad us. Protecting first keeps healthcare system afloat.

HCW getting sick/isolating short-staffed ICU, ER, etc less capacity care patients
 

An elderly person’s life isn’t worth yours, like 15% chance death pretty damn high. J&amp;J approved, goes well, early February. sure AZ. Providing supply 2m vaccinations day entirely possible goal reached

It virtual certainty get there. 400 million doses contract guaranteed delivery July 31.

If J&amp;J and/or AstraZeneca get approved, number skyrockets further. here! moved NYC August everything remote it’s tough meet people. Right city empty feels even colder harder socialize. However really looking forward summer! want 800 handmade tamales Funny story.. I'd lived east coast moved Texas work training months. I'd weeks, gotten good buddies classmates around US.

One random Saturday morning grocery shopping walking back car fairly empty parking lot rather old Mexican woman pushing small cart approached me.

In broken English tries sell small packages wrapped aluminum foil. I, rural northeast assumed burritos told (in best Spanish I'm sure sub par) already eaten breakfast hungry, thank you.

She nodded walked off.

I told friends class every single one chuckled outright laughed, told passed probably greatest Mexican food I'd ever eat. ""Literally nobody cooks tamales better Mexican grandmas"".

I 2 months never saw again. Bet ass looked too. animals known test positive virus know of? 

Minks, Cats, Felines specific, Gorillas? else? Lool final form grandmothering. mainly networking right? ppl sub racist western-supremacist lol let rage use higher dose effective low dose? lower dose, lower risk side-effects. think, discussion’s sake, number undetected infections make difference areas much others. infection rate isn’t entirely homogenous, it’s scattered clusters, theoretically heavily affected areas asymptomatic infections lesser infected areas would fewer. think hard gauge exact impact heterogeneity. I’m nurse too, infectious disease expert means I’m speculating. really think public/private partnerships going key successful vaccine administration, need come strict timetables, accountability fallback options timetables met.

This real failure OWS. OWS required states submit plan distribution, plans focused would get vaccine, get vaccine WHEN. Careful. People like use r-word. PAX East tentatively scheduling June 2021. r0 people inside room together much higher, since airborne...

I would surprised otherwise! we're discussing herd immunity state/country level, can't use R0 specific scenario (inside room) apply entire US Also, one new strains 70% infectious?

Something like yes, that's Youyang Gu adjusted estimate herd immunity level 60 70% US population. (if want know, that's R0 going 2.5 3.3 third higher) might adjust course, someone else explained, [it's tricky get accurate value required herd  it’s storing. It’s using. can’t become storing complacent 😉 vaccine complacent. Truly. It’s one dishes truly special. Tamale season litty. available US first - J&amp;J AZ? travelling pandemic? Fuck you. Hypocrite. Non vaccinated people spread non vaccinated people cause healthcare nightmare though. Again, common sense. How’s study coming along Clorox injections? study bright light treatment? assuming people swallow bright halogen bulb cord coming mouth, cord would running wall outlet would stay plugged treatment. would long cord, really long, go places. I’m mean people saying could brown, white good. could white way won’t trip golf course. best cord, best cord have, doesn’t dissolve acids there, maybe wiper thingy clean chewed hamburger bulb shines really bright. maybe it’s different that. Anyway there’s studies, lots studies, heard shining bright light inside know... Maybe - gut says, even spread occurred there, overly significant.

People willing get tested probably already cautious getting tested. So? What's changing? eye can't imagine thing.

You can't, can.

And ass protesting shit far I'm concerned, nobody doctor able access medical information. Certainly anybody thinks demand it.

Your medical information treated like social security number. consumption anyone asks, anyone entertains idea told they've got nothing hide, surely divulge every condition, ailment disease they've ever had, worn t-shirt times. flu season, 3.5M vaccinations per day, definitely doable. I'm Washington state.

Bars pretty much closed since March. said vaccinate first. don’t support giving access things non vaccinated people can’t yet. everyone oppurtunity issues date farther future people think though. need 75% happen. injection, need keep observation 15 minutes case severe adverse reactions. tracking different strains help identify spreader events places. bunch people show variant went say bar shows bars church, need make sure following guidlines high time enact some. useful well keeping eye dangerous variants It’s profit Japan much making back already spent. I've almost year can't forever, insane. point I'm gonna rooting apocalypse. Seriously fuck this. Youyang Gu, data scientist, estimates [74M infections December would make close 80M today, far CDC (or, perhaps, CDC far Youyang Gu). Back attended church, partly never chose actual home church, used donate ""tithes"" charity local family. still that, tithing reasons. still care people. need church telling help others. see someone needs help, help them, that's it.

I figured God knew giving, direct way. Scarlet O’Hara’s open? start arresting dumbfucks endangering people? Please, ridiculous. It’s stupidity. kind stupidity people think they’re smart. Dunning Kruger action. Yes based age (for general pop aside Long Term Care Homes Health Care workers high risk Indigenous population remote communities). goes first 80+, 75+, 70+, everyone 18-69 around risk profile. believe realistically clinics probably 65+, 60+ downwards 5 year increments logistical purposes. way paywall. can’t find actual evidence headlines claims. assume it’s another rando interview ""I'm tell people do"" - Governor Florida also lower population density countries. Population density natural form social distancing. said thing another post got downvoted hell.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yes, Rt = 1 **with** human intervention.

(and actually, would need Rt &lt; 1 herd immunity) 50% population it, would lot 1 360 deaths COVID-19. would closer 2k. Rt = 1 definition herd immunity. Herd immunity mean infections stop. means exponential growth stops linear growth begins. Rt = 1 equilibrium diseases without human intervention. believe CARES Act guarantees pays 2 weeks COVID sick time get it. employer gets reimbursed think CDC says found quick Google search.
Consider following sources next time avoid looking like obtuse asshole. 

Key points note:
CDC advising prior infection reason get vaccinated. Still get vaccinated. 

BBC quoted study China 175 people found 30% low levels neutralising antibodies.

BBC also pointed regarding six common coronavirus strains, ""Four produce symptoms common cold immunity short-lived. Studies showed patients could be re-infected within year.""

Also BBC, ""Scientists Hong Kong recently reported case young, healthy man recovered bout Covid-19 re-infected four months later. Using genome sequencing virus, could prove caught twice virus strains different.""

So recalling incorrect, neither you. Right now, confident immunity lasts 3 months, limited studies indicating immunity could falter year up, know viruses cause strong immune response immunity usually remains years even decades. That's scientists saying expect natural immunity generally long lived. 

However, majority cases mild even asymptomatic, long term immunity cannot default assumption. also know strains popping now, exposure people, viruses become likely mutate. Differences genomes strains shown limitation immunity.

There enough information certainly enough time passed get it, best advice conservative expectations proceed caution. best hope produce strong consistent immune responses vaccine limit viral mutations via exposure.    Isn’t freedom though? Aren’t giving excuse govenors giving responsibility? blame game trump ridiculous here. States months prepare. one forced Florida bad this, one forced california hold doses [Youyang Gu calculated prevalence ratio every day since August 2 weeks ago. 

His model estimates 280k people infected total (which gives implied IFR 0.49%, higher unreported COVID-19 deaths) and, yes, nowhere near herd immunity, pointing ""3x rate"" unreasonable. Natural herd immunity =/= vaccinated herd immunity.

Epidemiologists estimated natural conditions, lower threshold needed natural vaccination. Basically sociable/biggest spreaders get first give first. slows down. Brazil’s Health Ministry said notified Japanese authorities **the new variant 12 mutations, one also present variants found U.K. South Africa. “It implies potential higher virus infectiousness,” said.**

This one might deserve headlines worrisome mutation one linked tin increase infectiousness. Hope article details soon known. came say this.  Hopefully 2021/2022 Tokyo olympics face cancellation. Otherwise could think pandemic ""WWIII"" also mutates, random luck favours mutations spread effectively whatever measures used keep curve flat. I've still seen details new mutations infectious.

Net effect, stopping ""flattening load"" giving virus maximum opportunity mutate dangerous version. Seriously. means get fucking vaccine quicker can't mutate much. Mr mrs philip (who Mr Philip)

Queen prince philip (who Queen Philip)

\#consistent Kansas’s peak November 9, mask mandate didn’t take effect November 25. steadily going mandate continued decreasing rate look seven day average numbers. Imagine spending millions dollars spread world peace wanting set fire. called greedy rando side planet. vaccines effective ""new variants"" every country give lockdowns way people wait another years locked cages.

There people ready locked life care others.

Just hope vaccine effective. Ahh. think get it. government make fredum loving rural conservative wear mask want buy new hammer $12 whatever Menards tells to. Well despite North Dakota’s unwillingness much terms preventing spread, population fairly spread out. huge amount people already removes chunk spreaders also. It’s also pretty cold lately maybe people going less? last part guess Yeah something give, either something delayed postponed cancelled accommodate, whichever summer winter Olympics good news bad news? going reimburse them? Every god finger noses. ""'I'm taking them, take them!""

They'll end hell, since devil takes everyone. people keep saying mass vaccination done June, part world guys living?

This applies mostly small first world country. 3rd world countries like Brazil estimate vaccination mid 2022 only! Require negative COVID test 72 hours departure, immediate quarantine, another test 24 hours arrival release. island enforce strict border control like that. sends SWAT team raid former employee’s home front kids spoke handling pandemic? Thanks running numbers. general sense this, good analysis based rough data. Shitshow. politicians trying look good vs right thing public. joke? that's fucking awesome. finally good news Cant believe premier league football still continuing? Surely cant continue risk health players true.  yes, specific makes toxic? middle aged now? Na provide food, pay people stay home lockdowns work. Supermarkets Pharmacies open. point curfew, forces businesses close employees don’t go work instead stay home. means workers eligible financial compensation government can’t work.

Those work, designated essential services, given letter employer show questioned police. CDC tracker (as 8 Jan 2021), North Dakota vaccinated 3.9% Umm..... don’t think article says think says.... 'Coup attempt' one Japan incur expenses hosting Olympics receive none money? read? Good news since already delayed. According [this data (who first accurately predict official death reports back spring), [ND third population Covid19 spreads exponential. ""flattening curve"" ended series dips &amp; peaks. current peak still climbing control. think picking choosing parts comment get angry at.

Also, perfectly valid angry took ineffective half-measures.

Giving cancer patient half-doses chemotherapy poor strategy leads needless suffering.

Clearly way deal lockdown eliminate COVID get tiny, tiny case numbers handled without social distancing.

If completely fuck up, bludgeoning society ineffective half-measures making bad situation worse.

FWIW, support Sweden strategy, kept hospitals buckling. way threw hands said, ""we can't control this, let's anything work make things worse already are."" Well let’s acjally wait bit see effects. another clickbait headline isn’t based anything objective personal anecdotes.
Why wait actually see actual objective results read article? People upset Quebec administering second dose within recommended 21 days. using recent death proof one dose enough protect elderly residents (and wasteful really, lives would saved 10 people two vaccinations 21 days apart 20 people one vaccination). low risk complications/death unfortunately change fact it'd spread others possibly someone would serious for! I'm SOOO irritated might wait til Sep Well, looking see God earlier schedule... Pretty sure 120 miles doesn’t even get 1/10th way across CA lol vaccine yet people keep dying. Hopefully people appreciate better trump's main goals That’s happens government completely blows little respect still bungling entire thing start leaving people dry. 

They’ve failed every single juncture. wonder people don’t listen. Wait what, mega church?  Fauci admitted weeks ago misled people (for good) 60% claim revised 90%. know vaccines takes consideration? Throwback Monday? wanna point republican run state social media wannabe's though. I've talked couple college-aged interns LA they're disturbed huge minority 20-something peers who've decided they're virus. say circle 2/3 under-25's still following precautions limiting social interactions, remainder that's really gone full-out Living Best Life since holiday season started. They're shopping, partying, traveling, even going underground clubs. post insta/snap/tiktok whole world see, really appalling hundreds ppl dying day state. actually undercount 8x (real number) 90% population already got it.  state got caught using treatments vaccines? positive test rate 25% climbing (the national rate 7-8%).

[It's getting close 10% Idk accurate is! put age dads age ti gave us date. He's like 35 years older though going administer (partly) based age? really think that, there's way enforcement stop people visiting friends' house, infeasible logistically. We'd need cops basically stop anyone authorized reason out. course happen, point, we're relying people responsible. Californians made choice.

Most people wear seatbelts operating automobile, even though would literally impossible law enforcement cite everyone not.

At point game? moot. coordinated effort (and ***buy-in***), statewide, mitigative best practices would've far effective.

The trouble many enforcement bodies refused jobs. are. Lol WHAT? audacity confident? Dunning-Krueger would like word you. sincerely doubt fucking OLYMPICS going go 5 6 months ...... would love wrong. worst case scenarios always come true virus. literally first 3 groups would assumed getting initially anyway. Cuomo talking seriously huge fines people approved? people weren’t approved?

What fuck? Dude hospitals overwhelmed mean bad put people hallways... (Which doubly true since people end hospital covid need ventilated, needs specialised machine, leave patients hallways might well deliver undertaker instead hospital first place...) always personal choice wear mask. moment take away, taken away freedom choice. That's unacceptable. want wear mask better job convincing logic. coercion. force. shame. Lol hilariously post concept one person medical field giving ""expert"" opinion comment article form would suddenly seen trustworthy true uk quite good record people taking vaccines. difficult understand this? cannot evidence long term side effects mRNA vaccines simply data vaccines use long enough. I, along many others know, would prefer receive type vaccine lengthy well-known track record long-term safety efficacy. makes upset oh well. problem. eating shit lies?
I done him. *In related news, Tim Stephens arrested today, Fairview Baptist Church southeast Calgary doors closed today, health hazard.*

/s. 
 
Hopefully 1) impossible know

2) HIGHLY improbable lot areas antimaskers crotch goblins running amock select areas. Mostly rural outlying suburban areas. Honestly, mathematical chance that?

Assuming he's 20-49 age group low chance dieing. (Even population average IFR corona 0.3-0.8%).

So bet it.

You could bet fact thousand similar pastors, might die. clear confused? curious, exactly people like holding vaccination process? think know saying want make sure offering counterpoint lol saw California exploded n new infections despite lock downs mask mandates whereas Florida seems stable despite open ... Rule #34  Dakotas well vaccination efforts point macro level see vast majority lockdowns seem delay spread varying degrees don’t stop coming back.

That said... vaccines incoming makes sense mitigate spread, however every place really need evaluate restriction needs. Again... won’t use. government put huge money converting field hospital NHS underfunded years there’s actually staff available man without taking away existing a&amp;e ITU provision. Another Tory white elephant. they’ll take courts, way supreme &amp; it’ll ruled 6/3 unconstitutional. China word this... ""chabuduo"". I'm sure soon Biden team gets boots ground, they'll start turning around. hang bit longer! Remember UK article (consider cultural context) headline short hand, that’s interrupted. It’s clearly referring two people, “(The) Queen”/Queen Elizabeth Prince Philip. hate much phrase ""long-term"" bastardized relation COVID. I've seen many articles proclaiming X% people diagnosed COVID experience ""long-term"" complications... read article see ""complications"" means anecdotal, qualitative statements patients, ""long-term"" means couple weeks usual. Maybe news outlets outright saying ""long-term"" effects permanent, implication clear; symptoms last two weeks, they'll put category used scare people thinking COVID give lifelong pain suffering Asks nicely. gun Even point get downvoted arguments. brain damage kids covid article keeps popping feel obligated point it’s one mom interviewed kid admits neurological issues 2-3 years ago now. 

We see news article, see it’s random interview, decide ignore it. know easy find ONE doctor ONE nurse tell media want hear? Tbf compared many (if most) countries, despite poor start China well... (And yes used Draconian measures, human right aspect problem, still worked lot better 'Murricas ""freedom"") really lockdown? DeSantis much blood hands. honestly missing much. select bunch beaches keys. little spanish history decent food south. Ok, reduce number times we're allowed go shops essentials. else do? Get rid support bubbles? Make legal requirement employers prove employees cannot work home? Close construction sites? I'm running ideas. get vaccinations done! find every stadium, every arena, large open parking lot, get people drive vaccination drive!!!

You can't testing postive Covid cases obv. feel gret completely asymptomatic. siply go get test. dead body however alomost always lands autopsy table. 

Like said that's good news. moms nurse sister is. got vaccine right away. kickass work save lives everyday covid units. 

No protection? way access testing ppe whole pandemic? I’m devaluing nurses it’s insane claim healthcare worker death/hospitalization rates relatively extremely low. mental toll brutal covid contact nurses/doctors get tested frequently great ppe minimum (to fair I’m assuming us/west here.) Good. name virus actually SARS-CoV-2. infection caused virus COVID-19. 

SARS-CoV-2 strain coronavirus, new discoveries known variants virus. Basically it’s hierarchy see as: family strain variant.

They don’t use new name like suggest infection (COVID-19) remains unchanged. mutations happening virus Worth noting universal underground scene LA. people throwing parties minority, publicly shamed called others underground, endangering people dragging underground's already poor reputation.

There many good promoters struggled get almost year without thrown events.

There's one promoter whose events never attend invited secret Halloween party drew hundreds people LA (I obviously go). think Islam religion also cancer?

Because seem imply that. absolutely agree. Religion also good mental health also affects health positively. Congress withhold federal funding state follow directions institute regarding vaccine distribution. large events, wearing masks, large gatherings ""being locked cages"". Jesus people worse toddlers. Temp checks almost useless. Recent research shows 1in 3 1 4 develop fever, beginning thought everyone developed fever... think guys missing point comment (seeing downvoted guy is).

I’m sure must theory! *talking* about? Nobody wants genocide Christianity planet. can't conservatives ever rational discussion? 

Selfish people break COVID rules frequently. makes difference they're liberal conservative, they're asshats. Stop trying make us vs. argument. We're together . . . discussion people harm others society refuse courteous. studies disapproving drug? Sorry, sound smart. (Most nurses know aren't.)

B: Brexiteers make Britain look good, otherwise point? deserve criticism Why? knowing country can't speak specifically, ""lockdowns"" many holes compliance sucks. keep repeating, real lockdowns. 

Not I'm saying country this, Wuhan literally welded apartment buildings doors shut. *THAT'S* lockdown. Might confusing CRISPR PCR? Anyone else experienced altered smell body odor? BO completely changed chemical sweet/sour smell it’s awful. Apologies mom I’ve made smell pits confirm it’s sense smell that’s changed actual odor. Half nurses wanting vaccine red flag shouldn’t really view better anyone else. 

Millions people vaccine. scared want endangering people’s lives. don’t care oh nurse construction worker, thing matters ending pandemic saving lives. can’t look st millions people taking vaccine fine, decide put people risk, deserve criticism. Maybe sounds harsh point many people ok lockdown affect easier demand lockdown. Yes, looking couple days ago. I'd really interested seeing factors play lower death rate. top head I'm thinking diet (outdoor ) exercise contribute better outcomes. dust settled maybe get answers. Collectivism could easily compatible Anarchism, communism.
It communal responsibility organisation, economic model. I’m upset beginning pandemic told wear masks “it necessary” would scare people. (nurses) getting trouble wearing masks March. knew BS. knew respiratory virus. Respiratory viruses spread droplets masks protect that. That’s basic knowledge. told wear whatever could find including socks faces. began get angry. given different emergency use medications. pulled causing harm good. emergency use vaccine came be. lot nurses females child bearing age. vaccine studied pregnant people. called anti vaxxers even though nurses never referred anti vaxxers before. love vaccines. love vaccines studied 10+ years proven safe. I’m angry we’ve treated we’re expected get emergency use vaccine hasn’t studied relevant population don’t get labeled “needing educated false information.” There’s reason we’re one America’s trusted professions. Half nurses wanting vaccine red flag it’s we’re stupid. slow vaccine deliveries many places. required doses Denmark would entire population vaccinated early spring. becoming insane many articles/headlines get upvoted moon based little fact true scientific study. favorite example article Covid causing lung damage X amount recover. way headline comments worded would thought journal article real research based random group Covid survivors. 

Nope! Turns anecdotal interview ONE ER doctor talking CT scans sick enough covid hospitalized. *opinion* it’s happening larger scale. anyone think respiratory virus cause lung damage needed hospitalized? Good lord. I’m denying may long term affects, acting like us no/mild symptoms popcorn lungs forever irresponsible. Mind people convinced causing brain damage insane things. 

As someone Covid months back, speak saying able resume normal exercise easily, zero changes breathing pace — symptoms fever cough. 

I miss sub real facts sensationalized headlines. Cc yourself. deserve more. Tx here. think medical staff get first. However, noticing people medical staff getting yet high risk..... I'm like uh get it? know people work covid wards gotten yet. think so, vaccinated virus dead  think also important note necessarily policy recommendations. people may indeed want take precautions vaccination. that's fine, many others, including grandmother, otherwise acted perfectly, want done ASAP likely drop many precautions they're jabbed. either case, anything public health rec Mexican here. 

The pandemic control since start. person charge action ""control"" pandemic whole efused MONTHS recommend use facemasks claiming use proven effective. mean 6 months. 

Tests kept minimum. Claiming waste money massive tests useless.

Lockdown late, even got ""advantage"" knowing beforehand happened Europe Asia, categorized harmless. 

That nothing worry about. official communications claiming nothing worry about. Flights never reduced, massive events allowed, large markets full people.

There dozens videos president politics claiming disease rich people, affected corrupt people magic stamps worked (I wish making up). president ""conference"" Monday Friday said people go love normal lives Europe peaking cases. toured country hugging kissing people.

In text says: ""Based data world literature oldest evidence presence SARS-CoV-2 virus human being.""

The study identified coronavirus 10 november 2019.

Is possibility coronavirus origin's China?  99.6%  Tucson. guessing person going per capita cases. Tucson nearly populated Phoenix, last large numbers looked shows Tucson 1/2 number new cases Phoenix. That's alarming. site I've checked fairly regularly shows breakdown county Newsbreak &amp; know 100% accurate. think site completely accurate time, ever. seeing much less people wearing masks properly &amp; social distancing. Even 100% true Tucson worse Phoenix, still rising numbers higher amount before. 

I know family large gatherings, refused invitations to, holidays &amp; continue come contact 10 people day &amp; know following guidelines &amp; even sharing meals almost daily. 4 them, test, positive Covid &amp; I'm sure quarantined. 
What's even stranger, me, family canceled large Thanksgiving gathering, due one older people getting Covid, yet resumed Christmas &amp; New Years.  excess deaths COVID deaths. US country  functioning health care system even get free pixel test without insurance Travis County, example, 88 sites designated administer vaccines, roughly three quarters majority non-Hispanic white census tracts. Dallas, southern part city — people color predominate — fewer distribution centers north, tends white affluent. 140 distribution sites Dallas County 10 located in majority Black census tracts while 37 majority Hispanic census tracts.

10 distribution centers compared 88 white 37 hispanic. Less 12 percent centers located white areas 27 percent located hispanic areas.

Black communities left die care hispanics. 10? 10 135 stations? That's one blatant examples little country cares one group.

I know people backgrounds refuse take vaccine. people backgrounds want it.

Why poll areas place stations accordingly instead assuming? Lemmy concurs. like one They’re occupying power certain conditions. doesn’t mean Israel responsible everything occupied territories, UN mandated agreements Israel responsible for. case, health isn’t one them.

Makes sense. man, feel bad athlete trained entire life one opportunity show skills world stage, dream completely upended. Yes many lockdowns significant enough disruptive significant enough really slow spread.

Also honestly think still really know virus spreads. lockdowns working indicator. California supposedly locked spread like crazy. Rather telling people double triple thing think need consider missing something important.  That's perfect; people already used getting stabbed there. virus circulating Europe America months 2019, killing millions westerners.

No westerners interested country started pandemic care Chinese every day.

Isn't hilarious? actually think focus people want get way overblown already almost feels like smokescreen. There's plenty people want can't get U.S. doses sit unused getting thrown out. takes long trial results.

That's still incompetence governments. allowed challenge trials volunteers summer spend process tremendously. Given timeline vaccine rollout would make sense, doubt will. much money involved. source half nurses taking it? isolated stories uptake generally seems high. imagine top competitor athletic peak supposed originally happen, fall shape pandemic lose spot. source that? briefings, Cuomo New York talks ""refusal limit"" facilities reached vaccine moved on. health care workers refusing take hold anything up. Given NYC’s density, prestige NYS’ health departments... better state. 

NYC lower percentage vaccinated rest state. Honestly wish data besides anecdotes, general people get hospitalized due serious influenza see similar problems.

It seems hard get real data anywhere viral infections hospitalize leave issues. think hard generalize. nurses make headlines probably represent general population. resentment nurses perception refusing take vaccine thus holding vaccinations people. little evidence that. refuse take vaccine given someone else. many aspects easily replicable. Throw away beurocratic nonsense simplify who's eligible. Let anyone certain age get shot. soon start get surplus vaccines, immediately lower age limit.

Age easily verifiable health provider, limit easily adjustable, soon start run people within certain age range. dig you, think healthcare professionals much pressure moment making vaccinations 24/7 would final straw would stretch another step far.

The fatigue must suffering probably almost unbearable is.

I would also happy vaccine day time, detriment health (both physical mental) giving jab.

But result NHS stripped back last 20 years middle managers idea they're doing. Blame governments asset strip service point anyone goes profession set failure. I'm sure much versus obsession procedures. they're busy writing procedures already know work, people dying.

Also, keep using bizarre excuse need educate people want focus campaign? vaccinate growing number impatient people want it? feel bad athletes. They’ve invested entire life clock ticking UK, little study long covid too.

They found 20% symptoms 5 weeks, 10% symptoms 12 weeks. 

After 5 weeks, percentage people still suffering following symptoms are:

* Fatigue: 11.5%
* Cough: 11.4%
* Headache: 10.1%
* Loss taste: 8.2%
* Loss smell: 7.9%
* Myalgia: 7.9%
* Sore throat: 6.7%
* Fever: 6.7%
* Shortness breath: 4.6%
* Nausea/vomiting: 2.9%
* Diarrhoea: 2.7%
* Abdominal pain: 2.2%

Nothing specifically required hospital treatment result virus though. makes sense they'd severe cases would suffer longer.. 6 months still quite while. poor people. moved goalposts os acceptable *to you* information everywhere. kicking scientists longest time.

When that? Lol, way worse 2020  think understand. Lockdown sucks, feel way. Pretty sure small amount people barely affected overwhelming majority affected one way another lockdowns.
We demand lockdown feel like it, rather situation demands (unless want minimize impact vulnerable population).
I miss many things 1 year ago normal (going office, travelling, able go dinner restaurant etc) must make responsible decision follow lockdown regulation want minimize impact pandemic.

IF, said, current vaccines would work mutated versions, realistically 2 options: 
- prolong social distancing lockdowns scientist come vaccine would efficient mutations
- open consequences follow: increased number infected, near-collapse healthcare workers overall healthcare system, increased deaths (which increases chances one family members affected).

He's mask mandates people going want. Like ok, least try *something*. DeSantis useless 5 shots echidna penis pass considering we’re vaccinating everyone rather people 17 also don’t need 330 million vaccines either.  lockdowns every time someone farts. also rights. state can't grab street ship away prison camp organs harvested. Imagine giving people handmade food COVID. Stupidity never ends. Oh yah really fast! usually get done pharmacy like 15 minutes. swamped work, dog grandfathers deaths, Covid, totally forgot. Time slipped cracks. go doctor week, use now. mom still go though. think protect hospital (which great course) that's it.

You've misunderstood. 70% efficiency symptomatic case*. Treating like nothing, effective vaccine exists, silly. Everyone would jumped mRNA results good, everyone still should, mRNA option available timely manner. Especially combined serious cases vaccine.

* trial average 70%, subtrials 90% 62% - enough statistical power say 90% truly better 62%, mean toss better result (and round bit good measure). RIP dude STUPID STUPID. %positive also gone down, we're actually testing lot, too, number cases still high Germany enough vaccines, staff locations distribute them.

We're averaging 250k/week, 1 million per month. 83 million people Germany. current rates, we're looking 83 **months** get people vaccinated.

Yes, government looking ways speed even one proposal made public since vaccinations started 2 weeks ago.

We're long haul. reason war drugs failed reason covid restrictions CA failed day goes by

Here data masking. unusually low. Probably bit high anything compared mobility data:

Covid19.apple.com/mobility 

Note masking mobility compares successful Nordic countries. USA much, much compliant accounts. Even though Scandinavia keeps praised compliance.

These stereotypes basis real data ever seen. like think Biden administration cares see. wonder number it’ll make difference.

Are asking making difference terms slowing spread/herd immunity? already making difference. easy see? No, slow climb 1000 things layered top it.  prevent getting Covid, took least two months daily.

God help show say you’re hungry. nearly year shit. get people vigilant invisible, untouchable threat unlikely significantly harm long.

If policy causes immense damage (as lockdowns do) requiring near-total compliance achieve goals, bad policy. Yes, second doses likely quicker administrate since verify person's age, job whatever. show got first dose. I'm gonna annoyed mine come 5G. Yes, probably able get multiple vaccines supply longer limited. 

The Oxford vaccine far inferior, data mixed. results clinical trial 62% efficacy people, accidentally gave one group half-doses group *lower* doses ended 90% efficacy, averaged 70%.  However initial findings. could adjust doses based findings.

Importantly **zero** hospitalizations severe cases dosing group 21 days first dose. Oxford vaccine also showed evidence reduction asymptomatic infection single dose. safety data great.

There dozens vaccines development right now.  promising ones protein-based vaccines like Novavax finished trials yet. think vaccine landscape change ramp supply, take whatever's available. thought bad takes here, wew lad surprise go twitter Don’t trust media’s lies!

What mean? 2 million doses 50% per day? Even large portion public vaccinated, we're told continue wear masks social distance. tell us something virus. lot people already acting like they’re impervious infection might well take Vitamin D. results one fewer person admitted hospital, it’s worth effort get word out.

The downside less dependency expensive treatments, happen shares Pharmaceutical stocks. Locked widespread rulebreaking. I'm sure they'll get time goes on. EU ordered enough vaccines pfizer/moderna Oxford combined vaccinate everyone.

It's one that's front me. great, simple solution. love it.  tias always called chuchitos ones meat looked like Mexican style sweet corn ones, made banana leaves. I’m questioning everything. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat represents New Jersey's state capital Trenton surrounding areas, said positive rapid test Monday.
""She believes exposed protective isolation U.S. Capitol building result insurrectionist riots,"" office said statement. ""As reported multiple news outlets, number members within space ignored instructions wear masks.""

I'll admit, riot crazies breaking entering job, thought covid might #1 priority mind.

Then again, mask always securely face...so...there's that. 

Speedy recovery hopefully one else affected. suggesting exactly? pretty clear since day 1 help prevent spread (no matter government said, generally seemed line scientific sources media)

Also dont lick boot, defend horrible policies, :) don’t know specific timeline Hungary EU fat vaccine contracts major players wouldn’t concerned you: never feel comfortable public setting again. mean it, certainly comfortable I'll continue wash hands like surgeon.

This disingenuous argument.

If know people gross hell now, either never left house paying attention. 

That's I'm convinced anything short asteroid hitting earth end COVID. 

If every concert, festival anyplace tons people gathered, seen really clean people are. 

They magically going cleaner news told put mask. fact, based number masks find road I'm running indicates they're cleaner, they're putting masks fear punishment don't. God forbid China actually wants combat covid successful unlike west.   expected vaccines available everyone wants mid spring. vast majority people fine even enter national lockdown four months vein last year. four months *that* long tbh restrictions vaccine widely available makes sense, vaccines appear incredibly effective. would also surprised actually something long four months.

i hope start delaying organ transplants medically necessary surgeries again, many people much fine. medical people part first priority group therefore generally vaccines available though, seems like there's lot reason shut non-ER healthcare again. heros wear capes got plenty sub.

But, really want see going on, check Won’t someone please think men. Go one step forward. Legalize it, tax it, done it. Canadian sources generally consider indoor dining among highest-risk activities. we're going honest obviously going safe people likely poorly ventilated room mask removal, given we're going airborne virus. idea indoor restaurants controlled enough contribute spread almost certainly wishful thinking. Also, suspect opened restaurants would increase amount contact going population; people eating would going, good portion private gatherings would start going restaurants well people over.

We're far worst shape whole pandemic right Canada; right need something get control, gets control worse consequences eventually be. taken hard action fall cut second wave got bad, probably could've controlled pretty fast; we'd need weeks months lockdown achieve thing. worried much businesses getting hurt I'd think would want stop messing around actually try bring control asap; kick road severe damage lockdown inevitably happens desperation. think - I'm going limb - jack shit. reporting positive news California interpreted anti-Florida? Even herd immunity often topping point preceding drastically lowers spread. happens higher contact people, whether servers, deniers, healthcare frontline, nursing home workers etc; much likely get spread it; reach internal high immunity greatly lowers communal spread without herd immunity style overall. 

Sadly it’s hard calculate occurs Thank you. However, deaths hospitalizations drop cliff well vaccinate 220 million people. It’s step “if choose” - societal expectation ill, take steps protect people around tou.

Not everyone time - sick people symptomatic. Never scared it, lot ICUs capacity. Oxford/J&amp;J likely approved June boost supply easily.  went 500 person wedding.

Sorry hear India limiting wedding size. Probably cut back 3 days too. There's nothing without China's cooperation there's nothing China can't own. 

WHO people think is. hardly ever conduct primary research equipped to. either compile secondary research promote, coordinate, fund research relevant topics. Many programs fund even paid themselves; connect funders researchers. I've got big event June. (It's half ironman triathlon)

I'm starting worry it.

Worst part last year scheduled different one September, friend group rolled registrations forward opted go different one June.

It's seeming like real possibility September one go off, June one get cancelled. sure talking too, open people go around me.... leaders wear mask wear one properly, supposed follow guidance? flair commented. mean flip side I’d mad fully vaccinated still expected act like wasn’t, considering likely vaccines significantly reduce transmission  don’t agree. Yes, that's system Capitalism demands. Efficiency. I'm trying start political argument. simply reality system culture live in. Mainly around factories Providing supply 2m vaccinations day entirely possible goal reached plan reopen cases going up. means pointless sacrifice, like wars run politicians. Gabak, certified nursing assistant Commons, life support Upstate University Hospital becoming infected Covid-19. family believes Gabak infected Commons went maternity leave Dec. 16. Gabak gave birth baby girl Dec. 26, went home, hospitalized developing breathing problems. think vaccine #1 tool epidemic. However, think clear alone enough.

When hear vaccinated members Congress (though one dose, two) testing positive COVID-19, clear messaging needs vaccine merely tip spear, also vaccinated individuals still catch (and probably spread) COVID-19. I've read lot comments lately people sick speak though one jab they'll ready hit pubs. Yeah, know that. here, want vulnerable people life around protected. I'll also gain back freedom happily wait turn next year

But South things FALL (outdoor concerts, 15-20K football games, etc, etc.) vaccine distributed.

I’ve seen people float around idea letting vaccinated elderly healthcare workers attend things similar olympics person.

Priority vaccination good protects people risk. I’m going punished elderly that’s ridiculous. I’ve sacrificed many fundamental human interactions protect happy continue so, I’ll damned I’m allowed get vaccine yet people sacrificed  go again. Yep Oxford vaccine much easier store thsn pfizer since requires fridge temperature rather ultra cold storage like pfizer. not. Florida basically abandoned pecking order week ago shit-show still middle pack terms administering vaccine. Somehow, got DNA *up inside* subject. geography. great places growing things, might within 2-3 day drive. great places get wonderful local produce amazing variety. Going Union Square Market NYC summer fall amazing.

When lived London, great French produce seafood store would bring fresh food Paris every morning train. US access due distance climate. happened internet? used free say word vulva vagina penis without getting censored. got vaccine wife swears penis got bigger think takes 2/3 weeks immunity build up. top 4 groups vaccinated mid February early mid March start see deaths/hospitalisations start significantly fall then. Good 🙌 New York currently 45%. That's fair bit median.

Rural states also run spectrum. got Maine, WV, Dakotas well, deep south terrible. Kansas poorly. Wyoming anything write home about.

This really surprising. small states people make big difference making roll-out go well poorly. large states, trend towards median people involved greater spread good people bad people. Augustus tired go two different establishments bachelor parties live tiny ass apartment working using mini stair stepper dance wii. Nobody said pandemic gunna zero sacrifice involved. everyone keep assuming people actually wear masks, social distance, generally should, making assume rapid spread must surely due factor? regularly forget North Dakota state. people live there? Meanwhile Florida, seniors camping cars get one handful available slots done risk level, states hospital workers oldest people category. Stop trying blame woke shit never happened. They’re going finish first dose January 25th. you’re saying it’s easier give 700,000 doses vaccine vs 40 million? talking about? No, Japanese national government immensely weak legislatively unwilling act would rather face consequences nothing acting making mistake. individual prefectures (like American states) make emergency declarations- Japan collective country shame anyone breaks norm worst might that. happened start pandemic governor Hokkaido broke rank file- got slammed colleagues despite high approval public. 

Additionally, also country historically opposed vaccination government sued vaccines side-effects due healthcare system. happened 90s Japanese media ran it, caused Japan surprisingly low vaccination rates common things like flu, rubella hepatitis.

Winter starts September ends April/May years. people stay time windchill weather brutal there. least US getting vaccines out. Prioritizing vaccines seems biggest problem. mean - probably total introvert spends time Netflix video games anyway get pretend saint making major sacrifice?

I see attitude lot. I’m saying California shouldn’t hunker considering clearly anyone going 400 person rave selfish fuckwit, act like everyone playing field personal needs level sacrifice silly. 

California played good cards game over. People feel like losing anyway may well lose happy. Right now, state least, cancer patients priority access tiers vaccine. arguably vulnerable people death it. (It's hard pin percentages studies I've able find say anywhere %25 much 60% cancer patients COVID die. stage 4 patients 60% death rate. Stage 4 cancers even imminently fatal many times, treatable people years decades life ahead unless get COVID they're odds less 50/50.)

And higher tiers. even elderly cancer patients unless happen 75. 

My mom 7fucking4 stage 4 cancer that's completely stable, doctor give great outlook years life ahead cancer wise. She'll get shot I, perfectly healthy 29-year-old, get it. That's unbelievable. 

It's fucking madness there's priority tiers serious illnesses. Especially people MUST go visit hospitals health care facilities regularly. 

It's like they've designated worth shots illness sacrificed.

How many actually discarded? I've seen like 3 got dumped NY, that's whole reports I've seen.

It seems like people want talk getting thrown en masse actually cite anything showing thrown en masse. fairly obvious weasel words used you: ""are starting."" Taxes nearly simple here. anyone unknowingly infected prior even first administration.

How many people going watching news hospital bed see vaccines available everyone, immediately intubated likely die couple weeks later? They’re ones dying most. don’t disagree initial roll out. don’t think it’s implemented. I've working hospitals 15 years career worked COVID units since started. work hospital now. Everyone vaccinated nobody died it. people dying patients doubled private ICU rooms coded ambulance bay. morgue full, refrigerator trucks receiving bodies, theyre putting patients cafeteria, ran oxygen, National Guard working ED. never cared one patients they're dying, kindly shut lying maw  Enough. West Virginia. apparently still mostly local pharmacies rural areas, went route. actually working really well them, (highest vaccination rate country). news new mutation come US covid task force? CDC denying mutation. telling truth? covid task force CDC? think shot one mess sure 80% won’t get shot 2. state 4.4 million people 65 older, 402,000 doses administered Friday, according federal data, fourth-highest total nation. Florida used 30 percent vaccine doses received, behind 29 states.

Even ""free-for-all"" can't use supplies. can't imagine states handle things better available vaccines released them. response post subsequent responses responded to, post specifically. way, cool friends respect decision handle pandemic. tell better job.

North Dakota even debatable. North Dakota supposed give vaccines have? vaccinating 5 possible 10 people vaccinating 300,000 possible more.

What even mean? Next tell California better job gave 700k doses. parties, probably? People actively want federal government fail country. plenty failed states already, can't move one? population cows people. Certainly lot easier vaccinating 700,000 people 40 million California. Looking percentage good way look it. You’re comparing apples oranges. There's also Jesus jump cliff angels save conversation devil. 

Do test God. let kill yourself. expect see plateau nationwide end month. recovery here. Light end tunnel! vaccines distributed states health departments opting give out. cannot understand fuck we’re doing. allocated old people straight insanity. Florida Yeah boned. ""Religious people gonna religion cares consequences"" going strong thousand years Earth. /sigh Oh. Gotcha. misunderstanding. You’re relating blacks women often excluded higher education leads conclusions.. thought tossing stereotype women black people inherently “dumb”. sure?  Virus must tuckered wrecking state couple months ago brute force virus 😐. fuck. made comment saw people commenting good job they’ve done vaccine rollout. administered 30,000 doses that’s nothing. Yea percentage population that’s better that’s like vaccinating 5 possible 10 people vaccinating 300,000 possible more. number looks better percentage wise. tell better job. due fact majority NDs population live major cities seemed get bad fall, could virus also run course hosts actively harder time getting isolating others. 

That's think we're seeing right anyways virus less run course current amount potential hosts combined vaccination effort, beginning form better picture. No, Great Britain single island include smaller offshore islands. Fuck Scott trash. Tried taking Kratom us. probably less shots available administer late week. States get allocations early week doses shipped administered throughout week. natural cycle peaks valleys available doses administer. That's thing, lockdown *done right* would work, costs (both financially, emotionally, societal) would devastating. many lies going think Trump’s abdication responsibility placing states pretty great

One. say current plan Trump blame.

Two. even mention good one could better job

Three. say think you’re still going find ways defend Trump’s failures.

Four. I’m defending individual. defended staunchly today, trashed common knowledge GOP presidential primary debates years now. 

Five. Logistic concepts don’t change fast. years ahead then

Six. 

To help understand easier, tell exactly plan put forward I’ve stated disagree with? thing I’ve disagreed overly conservative approach focuses vaccinating right people vaccinating fast possible. 

*Disagreeing plan B mean support plan A.* Hell, I’d argue plan currently closer Trump’s Cuomo’s, mean support Trump? No, would absurd yet make mistake. local health department took 5 day weekend first got vaccine stock holiday still haven’t really started vaccinating people. Thousands doses sitting freezer hold little pop clinics 75+ only. 0 urgency. dont see super bowl would different every NFL match played 2020 simple. CVS shack setup admin vaccine. like pop places sell xmas trees every year....open 8-5 daily, longer work.

Get line. get shot. Go home. Come back two weeks. That's total bollocks also good system, point anything better wasting vaccines would like see math We'll 2022 Winter Olympics 2020 Summer Olympics np. number weird thing worried - number currently it, sure. That's something impact healthcare spread near future. total number largely irrelevant (except sense it, fewer get now).

Also, issue current restrictions much enforcement? making restrictions stricter going help, making someone feel like they're more? Canada's got army taking care it! Shh say anything. Social security insolvent 20 years go cheque I'm LPN I'm getting vaccine. lean right conspiracy theorist. I'm tired condescending attitude toward ""lower tier nurse"" . Get high horse, please. people like giving power government dependent them, why. Sometimes people Reddit act like everything great government runs everything. Nope. Uhm, what? reset include everyone else lol what?

You know Florida's population 28 times North Dakota right? would equivalent Florida administering 840,000 doses.

North Dakota literally received 44,000 vaccines. made similar suggestion another post NYC, opening phase 1b tomorrow. stand-by list fill space empty slots remain available excess doses end day (since Moderna vial holds 10 doses always get patients sets 10). 

Last week, clinics discarded extra doses end day find enough eligible patients. heated discussion, created stand-by list. friends went get vaccinated, showed hour early expecting line. Instead, line got vaccinated immediately. means unused registration slots, including ones friends longer using.

Meanwhile, people know eager get vaccine, yet eligible.  idea either vaccine prevents transmission?
I. E. vaccinated - still spread others? Florida playing arrogant ignorant olympics every 4 years, would fill events make destination year round, that's thinking colleges, since school could idk 100k students couple different colleges sides town, got plenty dorms, apartments, venues sports, etc....but still need usage, would concerts (easy enough college kids), high school tournaments, political conventions, hell, would probably need pro teams too. 

sure would big risk might work, think situation like would better truly rotting like bird's nest lol nobody taking responsibility. 

What fuck man.... forget nocturnal comes 10pm everyone home asleep way try cover incompetence. Karma kind COVID deniers, pastor. Tread carefully. blood hands - new phrase 2021 vaccine plan goes shit Hey California please stay hell Oregon Rona there's like 20 people ND lol. stop transmission? what's point vaccine then? else getting back normal? enough people administer vaccinations, trained volunteers 6+ month period waiting available. Instead nurses administer every shot, could overseeing small group people watching side vaccine distributing many years?

What length time available administering it? vaccine, given syringe. different far act inoculating goes

NYC vaccinated 6 million 3 weeks 1947.

Right now, they've vaccinated 200k 520k available 3 weeks, 2021. Available starting discarded

There's excuse bigger sense emergency given devastation COVID wrought. really good point. basically means got serious planning January 4th. pretty morbid echo chamber people patting eachothers asses job well done reaching high number deaths say ""I told so"" ""friend"" who's crippling debt closed business. 

Also, since like opinion resonate sub get downvoted hell, 300k people died covid year; last year covid 2.8 million deaths US. Somehow covid reduced number non-covid deaths least 100,000. blame internet that. do. Ability lock irrelevant effectiveness lockdowns. Lockdowns work. unable lockdown make lockdowns ineffective. makes unable lockdown. Based I've read r/COVID19, likely ""variant"" pop actual end pandemic able fought vaccines made currently. 

If virus mutate degree vaccines effective, also somewhat likely mutated point would lose ability infect human cells. 

From understanding, due fact targeting virus proteins mechanism action re: vaccines. yeah, sure. mean sound like bashing hard. God dammit straight rollout everybody day 1. Get line, get vaccine, meanwhile nursing homes etc also get time.... agree need vax read article science Covid sub yesterday says scientists say least 8 months immunity tiered system plan assumes majority healthcare workers get shot. hospital district work rural texas, 80% nursing staff refused it. everywhere feel. churches business plan, treated such. support relief efforts impacted industries individuals. take long time make everyone whole again.

Enjoying life actually help. It’s trope capitalism, consumption benefit us increasing demand, drives employment. issue super specialization. frontline folx dealing incredibly complex aspects system takes bandwidth. Think hospital like onion. They're membranes onion holding together. job make awesome blossom like cut layers, see layers either side membrane. Scott Atlas, Stanford radiologist, know shit novel viruses. I'm sure he's brilliant radiologist catch stray mouse turd someone's perfed abdomen. know know epidemiology. Forget lock down. get many old people vaccinated fast possible. Vaccinate 24/7. Healthcare taxed. Education taxed. Education healthcare direct demonstrable benefits. 

Religion cancer taking tax payer's money. religions enabled encouraged profit current system, would far less presence. words, would exist merits. (Like scientology /s)

Edit: typos I’m healthcare worker half signed first dose, eventually 2/3 us got it. didn’t said waiting see reactions first group. like get vaccine veterinarian stand long line hospital. Probably quadrillion $. ""whisper"" reddit data looks good. J&amp;J stringent process takes time get sorted. Probably end using cocktail stuff one much attacking along different vectors simultaneously combination yields measurable results. Yeah, there's enough research showing that's works. People covid absolutely get reinfected months later. wonder includes children, percentage children go (infected total). u/demerits780 pointed out, alternative term hospitalised patients ‘in-patients’. Either term would remove ambiguity. nothing “people least basic education”. It’s using right word misleading. think rules applied forever? 

No one suggesting this. straw man argument. Acute myocarditis pretty common viral infections no? evidence **at all** caused vaccine, how? grandma 80 still heart problems childhood virus. Oh okay. agree states need better effort reaching multi gen households. Deaths economy lockdown. mistakes, unleashing pandemic world? semi universal health care can’t threaten people waving healthcare bills front them. I’m sure get lot sympathy churches leading darkness 100s variants already US whole running 0.001% population dying every day. South Dakota's 15 pretty much same.  wait actually see actual objective results

That's clinical trials were. That's literally clinical trials are. rigorous standard that's established show effectiveness safety medication. vaccines designed back spring 2020. took nearly year testing safety effectiveness. waiting seeing. Well, considering best guess origin Spanish Flu 1812 Fort Riley Kansas, would seem possible. math dude. It’s incredible amount man hours. reduce linear time get task done teams it. way build buildings bridges efficiently. That's pretty brilliant idea. still think antivaxxer thing could fixed moving faster next group instead waiting around people clearly care get vaccinated. Every day dose arm day virus spread would otherwise. "" Mobility data showing spike movement Ontarians days Christmas when the government imposed described provincewide lockdown, beginning Boxing Day.""

North Dakota cases equal 12% population, true half population may exposed. Herd immunity on/off switch gradual well may reached level immunity state cases fatalities may drop off.

This may playing parts country too. think asymptomatic % something measured enough really be. worth noting 95% number relative risk reduction rather absolute risk reduction. absolute risk reduction less 1%. studies touted involving tens thousands people, Pfizer study, 170 diagnosed Covid-19 trial. those, 162 placebo group 8 vaccinated *inferred* vaccine prevented 154 162 people developing disease. 154/162 = British Medical Journal pointed *relative risk reduction* reported, absolute risk reduction, appears less source:  world's biggest problem humans. -__- No. advocates saying many elderly people color live nursing homes, live families (there 3 generations living house next door Houston). multi-generational households missed focus nursing homes long term care facilities.

You’re what’s wrong society. unfortunately batman definitely needed... True. Remdesivir wasn’t good hoped. see first generation “what shelves” treatments. monoclonal antibodies, inhaled interferon others coming front, hopefully see much better results running summer. I'm going give benefit doubt one, one reply.

&amp;#x200B;

1. know effective current vaccines, geared current major strain, new variants. Yes, new variants plural.
2. RNA-based replication, nature, already highly mutagenic. Every single replication opportunity transcription errors (aka, mutations). Every single person infected contribute countless new copies virus, least non-zero number mutations.
3. mutations good us. Weaker, less contagious, less lethal. bad mutations generate strains like 1.1.7.B.
4. Many people unable receive some/any vaccines due allergiesand/or pre-existing medical conditions. Herd immunity helps protect those. Reckless behavior puts others risk.
5. medical providers many resources, whether people, beds, breathing apparatuses, medicines. eclipse weakest link, invoke triage. People die.

&amp;#x200B;

Get vaccinated. part stay healthy. part minimize risk others. Stay home unless necessary. Wear mask. Wash hands.

If get multiple vaccines address multiple strains, it. thing flu. sure needed laugh. said before, deadly infect people. Please hunker people, going get worse gets better. going people tested vs tests done isnt it... Lmfao, nice one. many states starting week older people? know Georgia (65+), Pennsylvania (75+), Michigan (75+). ask believe improve? looked reports mentioning county level data? mind explaining point detail providing supporting information please? 'Hit reset' cute little meme mean anything. Where's plan replace current one would better?  How? Yea guy pretty skeptical masks lockdowns, constantly blaming media overhyping spread summer. started posting November credit 180, blaming media ignoring current surge.  going call bullshit, cite sources- otherwise sound uninformed.

1) unreported cases people get tested (example: spouse tests positive also sick) cannot get tested (which especially true early on). Anecdotally, know several people COVID, blood tests prove antibodies COVID, unable get test actually sick. improved vs testing (mostly) readily available unknown. Likewise, half country thinks COVID ""just flu"". think they're getting tested they're sick? don't.

If anecdotal good enough, studies also done. Here's two (warning, big words): nature asymptomatic cases symptoms. People testing positive symptoms get tests via line work contact tracing / exposure. Therefore, people getting tested without symptoms testing positive, logically stands others positive getting tested too. Getting handle true scale practically impossible.

Another article big big words: - understand things work make right. good chunk would like occur without masks

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fixed it. Initially USA flair government holding 2nd shots reserve. That's state responsibility... least yet, anyway. That's incredibly sweet Flair incorrect first think focus placed vaccines treatments.   
Part is, couple treatments developed really much Teachers going rooms full kids many hours per day high risk. think agree on, regardless politics. want schools stay open, definitely among first get vaccinated. You’re getting downvoted, aren’t wrong. 

This sub hardon opening shots many people possible immediately [Florida already it’s kind shit strategy hasn’t sped vaccine rollout-[they’re middle pack terms percentage vaccine doses get vaccine, know spread others, sure shit would volunteer. That's spurious logic thinking. essentially trying say society perfectly (or near perfectly) stratified age mix. 

I agree comment fatality rate 20 year old equal flu - immuno-normal person - essentially trivial risk. - data - disagree assertion 20 year olds ""should gotten it"" somehow help accelerate ridiculous precept ""natural"" herd immunity. 

No state, country, managed effectively execute ""protect vulnerable"" effectively, despite mantra indicating path forward. 20-somethings work nursing homes hospitals. 75 year-olds still go grocery store (or, least go walk outside every even food delivery available). Working 50-70 year olds still work Wal-Mart, office, myriad jobs run ""general population"" frequently. Many 20-somethings 50- 60-something parents see (right wrong).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. get vaccines quickly? skimp safety it?

The administration great job promoting vaccine development. (I gladly give credit credit due.) funding vaccine research manufacturing. normally takes 10-20 years $1 billion bring vaccine market. government subsidized money. scientists pivoted vaccines working make coronavirus vaccines. lucky picked right protein (the spike protein) spike protein seem mutate way would make vaccine ineffective. rushed early phases normally give vaccine hundred people watch side effects got quickly point gave large numbers volunteers. owe volunteers huge “thank you!” accepting risk. rushing stopped. point call “phase 3” trials. trials conducted highest level provide best available kind data: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. independent review boards evaluating every case coronavirus volunteers every case possible side effects. good news / bad news kind way, phase 3 trials gone faster expected virus control country right now. means easier volunteers catch virus, review board determine people caught virus group got vaccine group got placebo. wait 2 months volunteers received booster dose able look safety data. known serious side effects vaccines already market far come within 2 months receiving vaccine, think waiting 2 months adequate amount time.

2. vaccines right now?

We currently 5 vaccines major players US (in start phase 3 trials). Four use technology current standard US vaccine market uses, vaccine developers working long time. Let’s break down:
a. mRNA vaccines (commonly called Pfizer Moderna vaccines): mRNA genetic code surrounded lipids. lipid particles enter muscle cells, mRNA goes ribosomes cells mRNA translated part coronavirus spike protein. body recognizes spike protein foreign forms immune response it
b. adenovirus vector vaccines (commonly called Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca vaccines): use uncommon form common virus modified two ways: virus cannot make copies itself; viral DNA contains code coronavirus spike protein. works injecting billions copies adenovirus muscle. adenovirus infects muscle cell uses cell’s organelles make proteins (including spike protein). body recognizes spike protein foreign forms immune response it.
c. Protein vaccines (commonly called Novavax vaccine): uses technology used current HBV HPV vaccines, extremely safe effective vaccines. vaccine injection spike protein (which made yeast cells lab) plus something called adjuvant (which chemical prompts body form immune response).

3. pros / cons vaccines?

The pros mRNA vaccines seem good efficacy safety (final data available vaccine right now) manufactured relatively easily (which hearing first). cons vaccines difficult store transport require cold temperatures, it’s new technology. pros adenovirus vaccines relatively easy manufacture transport, J&amp;J vaccine seems require one dose. cons ones whose trials stopped possible serious side effects since injecting virus people, commonly cause less serious (but still annoying) side effects like fever. need see final safety data vaccines, especially adenovirus ones. pro Novavax vaccine uses tried true vaccine technology. cons takes longer manufacture, really safety efficacy data yet since starting phase 3 trials.

4. recent news efficacy Pfizer Moderna?

I excited hear efficacy news coming out. one, means scientists probably correct focus spike protein, means vaccines development better chance working. Also, 95% effective, way higher experts predicting. Fewer people need immunized achieve herd immunity.

5. think vaccines safe? Would get vaccine right now?

I trust FDA approval process set right now. FDA approves vaccine, get first vaccine offered me. knowing final data, right placed five vaccines front said, “which one would pick?” I’d probably pick Novavax, Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J, AstraZeneca. upcoming months going provide much information though completely reserve right change mind. decide whether get vaccine, asking myself, “does benefit vaccine outweigh risk?” Even get data phase 3 trials know small risk severe side effects vaccines. famous vaccine developer said, “I never breathe sigh relief first 3 million doses given.” know real risk long-term side effects catching coronavirus, point would say (assuming safety data predicting, FDA approves vaccine) benefit outweighs risk, even vaccine carries serious extremely rare side effects.

6. timeline vaccines? get “back normal”?

To honest, expect manufacture distribution vaccines next 6 months complete nightmare. know following people priority: essential workers (a category includes different people depending ask), age 65 years, high risk medical condition (a category includes different diagnoses depending ask). take broad view categories (for example, including obese adults make 30% population), talking 150 million Americans get first. Even increased efforts, nowhere close enough vaccine distribution capability vaccinate many people quickly. anticipate healthcare workers first responders vaccinated December – February, high-risk adults vaccinated March – summer. would low risk adults vaccinated summer 2021 kids vaccinated fall 2021 (they starting small trials children 12 over). current prediction means experts recommending health measures like physical distancing, avoiding crowds wearing masks fall 2021. feel optimistic holiday season public health restrictions. *in-patients Study?

It always baffles mind even true, people would rather dead kid kid autism. Jesus Christ. always possible. allowed spread, chances mutate spike protein Adjust predictions beliefs based new data. It’s ok one point thought everything would back normal 2021, (or Christmas 2020, summer 2020), you’ve changed mind, based things going. remember neighbours convinced would still able travel Italy April 2020. Things change. It’s bad refuse change them. Good god people racist already paid form taxes.. God say jump front car. God didn’t say take care body. No, aren’t folks. We've already seen mutations places, could also end seasonal like flu new variant every year. state (NY) , 21 year old cousin hasnt even graduated nursing school gotten vaccine already. 88 (going 89) year old grandfather scheduled soon :)  
I know girl substitute teacher private school scheduled get two weeks. teachers part next batch. bullshit, left house months many people NY going work facing people every day. (cashiers, grocery, banks) bullshit. know least two people scamming way getting sooner (going payroll family member's medical practice) one easily works home employed.

the entire pandemic shown selfish people are, vaccine rollout exception. Let’s say community gotten R value 1. 50 percent transmissible variant comes along. could mean mitigation effort got old variant virus 1 gets 1.5.

Which say: combat transmissible version virus, communities need even stringent controls.

A 50 percent transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need cut contacts another third compared already strong restrictions [already place] order get back place were.” could mean closing businesses partially opened back up, closing schools, lockdown measures.

If communities nothing face contagious variant, numbers could add quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked following thought experiment.

Let’s say community virus less control. R value area 1, means number cases area remains constant, month month.

In scenario, “you’ve got 1,000 cases now, you’ll 1,000 cases month now,” Hanage says (his scenario assumes takes five days one infection cause another). “Now let’s imagine virus 50 percent transmissible. .... 1,000 cases virus would translate 10,000 cases month nothing!” new production site Marburg, Germany, expected become operational end February able make many 750 million doses per year, according previous production target 2021 1.3 billion doses. Tamales made Mexican grandmother might best meal folks year. Thank god changing 9 days... made virus kill population?

Watch learn [the virus created   nothing, father lives panhandle able get appointment get vaccine today.  said bad, good website virtual queue opens noon. sat queue 10 minutes able get appointment. rotating actual vaccine administered, places mobile testing. know news, negative make sound like knife fight straight pandemonium, least one good experience.

I'm sorry, 1A, gotten even though likely work hospital, registered even though site open week, move next group.

To me, every state used least 50% doses open 70 75+ age groups. focus needs high risk death age groups well healthcare workers because, weeks now, apparent enough doses begin vaccinating time. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I know states enough funding both, think they're shutting public sites -- plus still private sites -- seems really unfortunate.  June July? It’s literally tho. Patients people called go hospital require care doctor. 

If title said 76% ‘infected’ covid still suffering symptoms I’d agree you. Almost certainly coincidence.  probably downvoted I’m posting either way.. I’m senior college, living small college town wanted say one really taking seriously anymore. school thousands COVID cases last semester hospitalizations, students don’t seem care virus unless they’re contacting family within two weeks. first, would scolding people this. now, people whatever want opinion.

Either way, wear mask. Earlier imo doubt poo poo pants pants Throw jail TL;DR: Girlfriend worried getting vaccine, I'm good convincing otherwise. Help structure talking points

Hi, I'm little bit conflicted right now, we've talking getting COVID vaccine soon can, girlfriend says want get yet. healthy young, maybe biggest deal right now, that's she'd rather wait bit. I, hand, get one soon turn.

I best argumentation skills, actually pretty difficult lay points confidently. points, even sound quite simplistic, I'd like bring better ones help.

* Even worried unforeseen side effects, probably much better chance Covid, even healthy. - rebuttal ""How know going safe 1 2 years line?"". logic tells unlikely develop weird side effects long time, read this?
* Russia, gather general opinion little vaccines whatever reason. tiny bits looking this, flu shots like small dose flu teach body fight it, least that's I've heard people say. (I know COVID vaccine is, looks it, flu shots work UK are). realise ignorant sounds, know proper names methods, that's also trouble convincing comes from. bad experience flu shots child, like ill one them, flu shot since 13.
* help 2 friends Russia, told parents whatever avoid mandatory vaccination hospitals sort campaign can't pay for!

And evidently lol. Japan world’s cess pool... country is. pandemic Olympics cancelled. people really care athletes, compete small scale broadcast that, without multi-billion dollar circus. checked anyone still living North Dakota die?

I mean, left? China.. still question “vaccinated carriers” resolved. likely occur impossible since already seen vaccines failures past. also possible vaccine campaign going uneven one area majority people vaccinated less majority cause outbreak people move around.

A vaccine layer protection bulletproof almost everyone around protected. individual health component public health component requires careful. look UK refuses acknowledge new variant comes UK august September normal mean would million things find. investigation SARS reason know originated wet market. discovered originated accidentally wet market, world may need take action live animal markets across globe.

I understand unless reach herd immunity disease somewhere go, given many people aren’t going get vaccinated idk possible.

I'm neutral towards them. I've several places honestly good whatever sauce them. caveat data - state whole 2.8%, 6% population 65+ gotten first shot Florida. important ones likely die/overwhelm hospitals get sick.

Oh yeah wow ok I’m dumb didn’t even consider powdered donuts. risk sending unsuspecting medical staff OD? mean guess looking logic people would decide lacing donuts fent good idea first mistake 🤷🏻‍♂️ get vials liquid fentanyl. Probably worsw new york higher population probably got   Heard immunity globally year?? 

I don’t think anyone really expected they? would expect EU, US, UK, Canada developed nations reach herd immunity year not, majority population vaccinated. military base close even get flu shot last week dec lmao true they've done pretty incredible. also true massive surveillance state government powers would make many USA extremely uncomfortable. appear 1 1,000 Americans possibly die covid. But, many USA willing give substantial freedoms (submit govt tracking, go ""lockdowns"" etc.) Perhaps climate plays role too. Vietnam Cambodia oppressively hot humid nearly year-round, viruses like cold dry. Even still hard time believing govt's numbers (35 died Vietnam, ONE died Cambodia?)....idk I'm buying that. Dude, thrown represents potential lost lives.

Potential? Sure. feel like people look one side coin. I'll get back strong defense bureaucratic nightmare that's set versus getting people's arms?

Because ""just getting people's arms"" save many lives.

This virus skewed death damage effects. 100 vaccines nursing home residents workers WAY ease burden pandemic 100 doses arms healthy 30 year olds working home. Shit, WAY even 1000 doses arms healthy 30 year olds WFH.

We vaccines make difference terms herd immunity opening gates yet ain't deal.

[We also see shitshow Florida still even ample population obviously **just** strict phases causing problems.

They've ""opened floodgates"" numbers top line. They're better average, issue oppressive tier categories, seen [them rocket top last still lag behind several states.

So defend beauracratic nightmare that's set evidence bureacratic nightmare causing slow rollout.

So, back doses thrown out. look [3 4 doses thrown New screech gone arms Cuomo killing people $1M fines.

But can't ignore absence laws, people [jump hard mix extra doses ""go waste"" call close you.

So balance two things? tough say least 1 shot arm 75 nursing home patient WAY good 1 shot arm healthy 35 year old.


Here's belief: Much issues stem federal government, people want states fix issues own. can't. money, resources, complete picture going on. feds going change anything another 2 weeks throw baby bath water (that work, see: Florida), keep improvements already seen. read ""handmade tales"" confused fxxking pretend ever believed China want scientist communicate publish special privately login protected websites? Specialist literature usually access restricted way. books, magazines, journals websites meant certain target audience. Even everybody buy access mean written way everybody understand correctly without certain domain knowledge. Canadians going fl get vaccine? even overwhelming media response, whole bunch people still don’t seem comprehend. SMH fXXking pretend ever believed China Legend says recipe gift given gods people perfected millennia. wouldn’t mind tamale hot chocolate right 65+? eligible get vaccine right now. give pointers registering case. 

Otherwise, hospital giving vaccines 65 certain pre-existing conditions part system.  
I personally taking vaccine, least understand others not.

You write teach vaccines schools, something hasnt FDA approved yet. ANYBODY takes right guinea pig. claim concerns unfounded, currently collecting data, stage 3 right now.  seen 80 yr old mom since Oct 2019. went taking care nieces nephew 4 days week, plus volunteering, seeing anyone. Maybe neighbors got cold, doesnt see anymore either. cold sit outside garden now. call daily check her, talk her. bored. Lonely. risky. Hoping gets vaccine soon. roll painfully slow elderly living old peoples home Fentanyl commonly sourced patches anymore. still happens, majority fentanyl comes powder China. comes pure, super small, cut/diluted gets destination. 

So one could go ""score dope"" used mean heroin, nowadays mostly fentanyl. sprinkle donuts. noticeable all.

Also, dopeheads often boil dope spoon injection make somewhat cleaner sterile shot. boiling, least light boiling, degrade substance. Boiling longer times degrade though. group lied everyone start saying masks effective. reactions previous vaccines absolutely needs discuss covid vaccination primary care provider. may simple ""make sure get vaccine near urgent care"" ""stick around full 15 minutes receiving shot"".

The primary care provider likely much better convincing safe.   I'm surprised additional analyses explore this,” said Manu Shankar-Hari, clinician professor critical care medicine Britain’s Guy’s St Thomas’ hospital, co-leading trial. underlying hypothesis using convalescent plasma potential treatment COVID-19 patients antibodies contains could neutralize virus, stopping replicating halting tissue damage. However, may lung damage advanced convalescent plasma make difference,” said Alexis Turgeon, critical care doctor professor Université Laval Canada, also working trial. Uhh, statistic sound like true.  Completely agree.

I wonder long media outlets continue acting everything terrible. cases deaths start go consistently vaccine progression seasons changing probably gonna write ""Well, dare happy yet: need quarantien till 2030"" shit like that. 110% this. live Florida love reading comments tourists TRAVELED PANDEMIC commenting people live ones taking seriously. Like... what???  WV rural, saying national chain pharmacies incorrect. Every tiny little town state Rite Aid/Walgreens/CVS along lots small pharmacies. used work one tech support area covered southern half state covered. Incredibly so, could easily said ""hospitalized covid-19"" title avoided confusion. get people consuming would know meant. Curfews push people place things closing earlier. politicians smart  It’s credible complain he’s done something bad. UK one world leaders vaccinations far. government seem made much better decisions areas Covid response. ""I'm anti-vaxxer, *but* ..."" sounds hell lot like ""I'm racist, *buuut* ...""

I understand people afraid, work healthcare understand benefits modern medicine, anywhere near forefront fight last year, duty basic research deal questions might have, get comfortable successful vaccines made available colleagues. Many done that. Chinese newspapers reported several cases related people back Russia southeast Asia. Oh holy shit, abuelita tamales best! comment person‘s friend perspective: aren’t together? Aren’t going feel consequences overloaded hospitals stricter lockdowns somebody needed go Disneyland? 

I read story 39-year-old whose chemo brain cancer delayed hospital overflow. Human beings don’t live bubble individualism, actions impact other. Sterilizing immunity seems likely humans given studies rodents Chimps. Ay, flaco. i'm curious, get first dose, happen ? lower immunisation rates ? nothing ? mean surely credit credit due one. government absolutely nailed vaccine roll - comparable country world. 

The decision over-order, back multiple vaccines, opt EU program - faced massive criticism, appears working.  right. place get vaccine near open like 8-12. Sure line keeps people like 2. open 24 hours day I’ve replied elsewhere here, story widespread uptake many non-specialist outlets around world, OPs science site. article requires medical education. know folks sell medical supplies meetings golf courses. Guess what? They’re vaccinated. guess I'm comparing flying staying home completely insolated. around dozen folks w recirculating air sounds pretty bad me. yeah even think airport. confirmed cases airport transmission? way complicated trace down? virus variants fake gucci shit chinese market family dolmades damn take forever make they’re good true. evidence studies this. easily assessable Google. gotta vitamin game. That’s like using 2 1 shampoo conditioner.  work Trumps team?

Mate European think Trump idiot. us understood perfectly, fault problem not. Also asking loaded questions... Especially 7 vaccination hubs opening today Kinda inevitable something like this. Emotional investment, positive negative, gradually takes and...well, there's r/covid19 science-based discussion.

Emotions usually deal anecdotes anyway. Folks come feel better.   Everyone know gotten appointment system Florida gotten card information return date/time expect second dose complicated first. That's hilarious. saw WV thought Sydney too... Although think real reason smaller pharmacies WV driving force. Small businesses get done! 

I actually really bad fear doctors/medical stuff sawbones/Dr. McElroy helped lot. I'm still queen white coat syndrome get blood pressure taken, I'm willing entertain going doctor all, I've come long way. 

Why help? dunno. scare much doctors worked like exposure therapy something... need vaccination centers too. live county big metropolitan area skews young opened vaccinations 75s. appointments booked mid February. Ridiculous. piece copyrighted AFP - apparently world’s oldest news data sources medical journals, I’d say piece much written general public. picked science website doesn’t mean article wasn’t designed general public. 

It’s also run many non-specialised outlets around world, Powder donuts. Mix powdered sugar sprinkle top. Assuming black people large monolithic group pretty irrational too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* country failed stupid people like Reuters article saying won’t reach herd immunity year.. especially countries. live US hope god get normality year. get vaccine (I’m super young I’ll last) I’m dammed I’m gonna care tiny amounts deaths equal flu/cold. Lots young people keep virtue signaling mask forever. I’m starting lose it, want life back bad don’t care anything else. parents get sick too? First country approve vaccine. Approved despite low efficacy rate small sample size. 

Last week, local authorities scheduled president jabbed Jan 13th. Indonesia ordered 30million doses Sinovac's. Alberta's fucking embarrassment. Thanks. basically saying travelled family group, stayed w family group, that's necessarily dangerous staying one place? pie sky thinking could actually isolated enough? think head flying among second worst things could (choir, indoor restaurant, dance club, etc much worse). sounds like longer considered bad? Would say 2 week isolation still important nah? vaccine free America. Maybe shouldn’t make bold statements like don’t know you’re talking about. agree this. friend I, probably made 50 vaccine appts folks 65+ across 3 states point. system hard, hard people good technology. 

We've calling ""adopting old people"" GRANDCHILDREN HELPING YOU?? That's media really pushing out. care visiting grandma, care enough help make appointment   Common knowledge really. Wealthy countries countries produce vaccine 6-12 months ahead others. 
We may need true herd immunity significant impact though. People talk herd immunity means zero people get covid point it’s widespread community transmission like it’s NY March. canyon’s worth middle ground.  reason everyone else doesn't

That mystery reason: delicious. virus dynamic system really single magic number represents herd immunity. people harder spread. Eventually many people dies out, behavior system point to.  2 1 pills @ pharmacy there's banter there's 'low quality information'. No, supported tythes don’t know graphic saw, bullshit.

The plane problem. plane air circulates side side, people you’re risk catching ‘rona dozen people nearby seats. air largely replaced rather recirculated - dirty air ejected vent back plane new air outside conditioned brought cabin. portion air recirculated (it makes easier keep air moisture content reasonable) HEPA filtered coming back cabin.

On hand airport nightmarish miasma coronavirus. Don’t terminal longer need limit number people get close way gate best can. That’s peanuts. France getting 70 million doses end APRIL. Yes, April 2021. Island surrounded water. 2,850,000 people died 2019...
3,000,000 2020


Unfortunately suicides rates went 150%. Suicides 50,000 2019. suicides tripled year tell you? 100,000k. overdosing drugs alcohol? significantly. extra deaths could blamed two categories well.

Not implying COVID deadly anything effects lockdowns resulted ""the deadliest year US history"" well. Shitty around course not. think enjoy pandemic lol? half set nuts collectively we'd hit covid zero mid summer Canada. us, politicians weak piss. Aussies, Kiwis, Chinese toughed out. florida deserves every bit Interesting logic zoom happy hour seems dystopian potentially spreading pandemic. advisory one thing also imposes 10 day post-travel quarantine returning Californians. also discourages non-essential travel state. WTF Good. Hopefully black market effective getting shots arms incompetent micromanaged state governments. Everyone EU countries wants get one vaccines get end May. early June pandemic completely, 100% EU member states. one fleece liner inside, would stop droplets splitting?  know hindsight 20/20, nowhere creating registry people want vaccine applying tiers registry, notifying people become eligible based number people signed tier they’re in? hard thing You’re seriously thinking making consideration wrong? Morally? don’t see able make connection. parents asses. really condone otherwise, next time mom calls selfish makes feel guilty feeling like shit this, emotionally manipulate her. less right now. dystopia waited almost 10 min today one 17 Mega churches pay zero taxes town uses police force direct traffic gigantic nd filled capacity parking lot. Nope, spread going there. Let hurry get groceries home make sure ready fun filled week work, school, elearning! Gotta keep schools closed. Wouldnt want virus spread. Folks Japan want see Olympics, stadiums. Athletes want see family stands. good chunk would like occur without masks, significant precautions required keep everyone safe. many, shot, want maximize it.

Mandatory vaccinations way could continue Olympics year. Sans travel ban, minus athletes support, covid continue run wild. every 8th year right? 4?.. regardless every even number, every uneven... OCD can't take it... push another year please, can't one.... Also 2022 likely got everyone vaccinated.. Hospitalizations leveling around 25k. icu leveling around 5k. Probably half ‘active cases’ actually active cases, think 10% number high what. less likely catch virus rich person. longer luxury lording get who. That's one reasons we're month live vaccines 2/3rd's shelf. 

One vaccinated human one less transmission vector virus. PERIOD.  realize vaccine doesn’t stop transmission right? putting patients lives risk? people go social distancing counties lmao? Probably weather. Getting cold much earlier time year ND one going shit spread well. call ""localized herd immunity""?

No. call social distancing... 12.5% ND covid, that's 1 8 people, every 8th person. I'm thinking places still ""covid free"" towns reached herd immunity, averaging 12.5% across entire state.

We look larger cities gauge we're herd immunity disease likely spread populated areas less dense areas. look Cass county Fargo located see 20,366 total cases population 181,923. That's around 11.2%. also look less dense areas like Slope County. 30 cases population 742 4%. think counties rural end things drop like that. randomly picking counties, I'm seeing highs maybe 14-15%. So, highly doubt even towns reached herd immunity unless talking places populations something like 10.  Watch new cases right? That’s define “back normal behavior” - individuals vaccine not. Maybe hasn’t caught up? governor said ago mask mandate, hard give sense urgency problem, people know numbers aren’t there. Chances deaths go up, considering went long sorta low numbers, vaccination efforts, I’m hoping won’t see massive amount deaths, barely make this. great way illustrate example someone thinking middle ground “doing nothing working socializing ten months” go 400 person rave. obviously plenty options in-between allowed people socialize safely. sister's mother-in-law nurse Riverside/San Bernardino area weeks ago said assigned patients ever cared there's way possible give appropriate amount care.  Lockdowns work Saying creates zero health issues long term complete lie. one knows yet since one experienced vaccine long term yet. 

Comparing long term smoking getting COVID comparable. One results slow death chronic health problems majority daily users. virus people waaaay overreacting terms affecting young people. CDC says [less 300K+ deaths U.S. (almost year's worth data) folks 34 years old. facts. 

And people keep saying ""long term health issues"" reason get vaccine young person. know regular influenza also chance giving long term [health too. even crossed mind flu past since covered news, fearmongering control facts right front everyone whole time.

I'm saying -- I'll advocate anyone who's older, underlying health problems already, morbidly obese get vaccine since COVID threat already fragile livelihood. However, I'm 27, work 4-5 times per week, eat generally healthy. I'm confident body able handle not, that's completely me. untrue, Japan’s case least. Even government puts full weight behind approval, won’t come late February due nationalistic laws protect weak domestic pharmaceutical companies foreign competition. president elect. 

He cannot anything yet. 
He sworn office first. read free rich donors get first, everyone else stand line see happens  mention certain respect physical boundaries Japan don’t experience asian cities. 
Only exception subway rush hours. wrote legislation, give medal... Fuck off. It’s year. Don’t act like vegetating couch watching Netflix substitution life. people subreddit delusional, privileged, shut-ins I’ve ever encountered. proof need teacher get vaccine? Islands little it, look UK far worse, slightly smaller Island NZ.

Most countries ability control land sea air borders. It’s awfully lonely sheltering place USA solo thought crowds like pandemic make anxious. It’s website linked. Here’s quote it.

“Life expectancy data available races 2018. Life expectancies black white populations updated data available. Due changes categories race used publications, data available black population consistently 1968, 1960. information historical data age-adjusted death rates available Probably literally 13 people live people problem? mean like less people vaccinate = less market vaccine-producers fight over? Poor capitalism :( people sub, no. desire ""new normal"". Watching first world privileged pratts pontificate “everyone stay home 😀😀😀😀“

Shit, even first world, ""first world people actually afford stay home"". Seems like huge cost savings me... Cool. There's 400k Americans left absolutely lifetime left, number keep going while. 

But I'm sure that's fine long get gym time. seen 3 million week thing? amazing NHS pull 🤞  Don’t turn something isn’t. expect elderly people die expect younger people die. Non-Californian seems like CA illogical lockdown measures (lots restrictions outdoor activities) still keeping indoor dining museums whatnot open? 

Also CA FULL lockdown months earlier year right?

I imagine people pretty burnt out... find upsetting global scale, several vaccines distribution (with come) seems like virus gone overdrive time starting administer vaccine (s) That's many staff lol, Let everything can't stand two feet, including medicine, fail.... expectations always late April July people start getting vaccinated priority group. ever said March earlier wrong. makes sense know politicians. Let's take drastic action news. I'm weirdo likes read stuff. OP posted helpful link anyways. agree folks prioritized, end hundreds thousands undistributed doses way.

How let priority folks get disney style fast pass skip line rest get first-come-firdt-served? Well majority first bill go individuals Oh can't wait fucking BAILOUT every place going asking (if) ever ends. Get checkbooks....   Fortunately, us get enough vitamin D, may good public health overall. sure miss Grandmother's tamales...😔 grandmothers ability cook food far beyond anybody attempt recreate. Grandmas food best best facebook doctors say fine Moderna states likely couple years [as wrote Can't think many mRNA vaccines would much different. States fine year. Maybe 100% back normal fairly close end year IMO. Whoosh. bottlenecks 'how many hours day' 'how many trained vaccinators available' 'how many fully batch-tested, bottled-up doses vaccine ready go'. scientific studies COVID-19 China preceded world became consensus

Is surprise China leads world sequelae research? all, one country suppressed massive outbreak Hmm. decisions specifically affected unknown number asymptomatic cases don’t need healthcare? Honestly sure anyone makes money there. Every girl seems now. supply must insane. Pilot's announcement: ""The flight Catania cancelled, we're turning around right meow."" Abuelita &lt;3 Que linda  Chinese person

Can define Chinese person. mean citizen PRC something else? There's really nothing vaccines (and vaccines general) sticks around long-term

Phew, thought supposed confer immunity 2 years more. Thank goodness long term effects all! Maybe people came back home via country roads? 🤔 health experts said Reuters Next conference mass roll-out coronavirus vaccines would result enough people immunity able effectively stop COVID-19 spreading.

To stop spreading internally country, agreed, vaccinating air travellers that.

It would stop spreading overseas. Losing friends stupid shit can’t control makes want give safe. ""We spend days making people happy get judged everyone. lot vulnerable clients can’t create bonds real life, human. We’re lawbreakers. law criminalises us. recognised are. normal people. pay council tax. someone’s neighbours. aliens two heads.”

Jesus Christ decriminalize already far vaccines proved effective stopping severe symptoms. Moderna Pfizer Oxford Russian, Chinese vaccines approved US EU.  think fair say vaccine developers knew expect J&amp;J would different.  
What I'm curious know, many ready deliver get approved 3 4 weeks. 50 million ready go? states remove red tape get arms quickly? Another way look infection (not case) fatality rate steadily falling throughout pandemic. Originally estimated high 3-5% CDC studies saying closer 0.25%.

I'd like see study puts US's IFR 0.25%. calculations show 0.67-1.24 (95% CI). well line IFRs calculated upshot every sick person presents case many people cases instead asymptomatic mildly ill see doctor.

Again, number people remain asymptomatic fairly small. one study shows this. meta analysis study 20,000 follow ups showed 17%. suggesting number infections 20% higher number cases? see case.

Why can't see case? lot easier case imagine herd immunity somehow kicked North Dakota seroprevalence showing 10.7%. look Manaus Brazil example. seroprevalence 44-66% September held model first place achieve herd immunity natural infection. Guess happened right paper hit biorxiv? Another large spike cases. Yet, somehow, we're supposed play make believe assume North Dakota, 10.7% seroprevalence, must feeling effects herd immunity place 44-66% seroprevalence manage achieve herd immunity? 

I'll tell happened North Dakota what's going happen. cases began spike, mobility shifted downward 18%. caused cases drop wave subside. waves basically every place last 2-3 months see similar patterns population... Cases increase, people start worry, reduce mobility, cases go down. Toward end year, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years. increased mobility lead another increase cases but, time less impactful (because mobility went back decreased levels shortly after) beginning vaccination. We're already starting see uptick cases North Dakota past weeks (from ~90 low point ~300 currently). thing see South Dakota, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Montana. expect see next wave mobility increases stays level increased rate (unless vaccine distribution picks up). good cook make damn good Tamales. even dirt poor Abuela put shame. making big decisions potentially dire consequences, faulty data (if actually true). Maza made?

We’re currently vaccinating 700,000 people per day now. Assuming doesn’t increase all, that’s 14 million doses given end January. Add 8 million doses already given we’re 22 million doses. that’s 6.7 doses 100 said done. pedantic, Barnard Castle actual castle (although castle, presumably owned English Heritage National Trust).    sure. nursing lounges overflowing pizza donuts ordered via delivery public Pfizer even made raw data public. no, scrutinized medical undertaking ever. could look data ourselves. 1300 30 million

## Abstract

**Background:** specific medications proven effective treatment patients severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, tested whether high-dose vitamin C infusion effective severe COVID-19.

**Methods:** randomized, controlled, clinical trial performed 3 hospitals Hubei, China. Patients confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection ICU randomly assigned 1:1 ratio either high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) placebo. HDIVC group received 12 g vitamin C/50 ml every 12 h 7 days rate 12 ml/hour, placebo group received bacteriostatic water injection way within 48 h arrival ICU. primary outcome invasive mechanical ventilation-free days 28 days (IMVFD28). Secondary outcomes 28-day mortality, organ failure (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), inflammation progression (interleukin-6).

**Results:** 56 critical COVID-19 patients ultimately recruited due early control outbreak. difference IMVFD28 two groups (26.0 \[9.0-28.0\] HDIVC vs 22.0 \[8.50-28.0\] control, p = 0.57). HDIVC failed reduce 28-day mortality (P = 0.27). 7-day treatment period, patients HDIVC group steady rise PaO2/FiO2 (day 7: 229 vs. 151 mmHg, 95% CI 33 122, P = 0.01), observed control group. IL-6 HDIVC group lower control group (19.42 vs. 158.00; 95% CI -301.72 -29.79; P = 0.04) day 7.

**Conclusion:** pilot trial showed HDIVC failed improve IMVFD28, might show potential signal benefit oxygenation critically ill patients COVID-19 improving PaO2/FiO2 even though.

i trust punch face, we're great friends, live side internet

and yeah, second thing makes good bit sense confirm, married Hispanic family tasted tamale first time three decades life, ones like MIL's. buy people time see them. Ive disappointed food life. mom Veracruz makes best tamales. likes make banana leaf corn husk always delicious. banana leaf ones favorite. ex's grandma italy

and right, every single time spread info start since worried public panic buying masks? literally evidence back up, think entirely possible may bungled way herd immunity (of least people already largely following restrictions). tamales used PPE? show videos, social media posts, ""journalism"" saying that. Sex work real work. Abysmal. absolutely proof E484K evaded immunity. ""First pandemic. planned-demic. scam-demic,"" one unmasked woman tells patient shopper. ""Because numbers... they're combine numbers influenza. CCP behind this. They're using political weapon destroy country inside out, destroy economy.""

We need better education fucking country. agree, way amazing first vaccines probably effective going people need most. I'd gladly take worse vaccine means someone nursing home gets Moderna Pfizer One big hurdles current medical research individual patient state.

If drug helps subset patients much, trials small uncover this, especially diseases show spontaneous improvement. Yet, majority people Sweden live single person households (no spouse, roommate, completely themselves) majority people Sweden ""socially distance"" stand back get close others. factors help mitigate COVID. main issue review looked industry funded research 99% study (not exaggeration 99% published literature) used active placebo masked side effects gave us incomplete picture risks.  date biopsy, also date patient showed skin condition. March pushing Idk herd immunity talk is, elderly vulnerable vaccinated bets off.

As far psychological impact, someone mentioned Gavin Newsom pissed away publics goodwill keeping strictest lockdown US 10 months. Maybe folks would willing comply winter surge. know else associated conditions, higher frequency? Contracting H1N1.

Beside point. we're talking vaccines long term side effects. pretty fast. believe read J&amp;J promising 1b vaccines 2021  I'm California AFAIK one strictest restrictions we're worse Florida recently. talking California. talking single city. LA population 4M significantly lower 21M population Florida.  Lots Europeans complaining compliance, UK nurse Camden posted weekend seemed like lockdown people everywhere.

Yeah Thanks downvote.

Wasn't me, downvite. Well, yeah. generally I’ve seen referred Guatemaltecos even Mexican family members Mexican markets. bad places government red tape would mean allowed achieve herd immunity. Anyone really expects us get close ""zero COVID"" setting massive disappointment. 

What vaccination do, however, protect vulnerable. vaccine gets arms majority nursing home/long term care residents 65 up, death numbers plummet along hospitalizations. cases 65 bad COVID cases end hospitalized die, yes. numbers anywhere close number 65 we've seen dying last 12 months? Incredibly unlikely. Look death figures state/province/country see deaths 65 up. 

Once vulnerable among us vaccinated us lower risk categories option get vaccinated, restrictions start drastically loosened deaths plummet healthcare capacity restored. Yep. Everyone got virus family safely recovered 0 effects. Even middle aged heavy smoker uncle New York got covid back March recovered week completely fine ever since. What’s common sense though? actually kinda salty, good, deep spice unique texture :) recommend. biggest fear is, many people anti vaxxers anti-this-vaccine? know tons people, family included, aren’t antivax don’t want get one avoid “it hasn’t tested enough” whatever. affect vaccinated population? many people like that? end get proof vaccine cards? interesting consider. People anything keep little fame gained pandemic. Even means millions jobs get lost increasing poverty mental problems. say saint gloat people hate dying beyond cringy. guy people know literally nothing else about, exactly said (doubt many understand Portuguese). airlines come this?

These explicit reasons another lockdown. Yeah, experts *do* know vitamin deficiency frequently found severe cases.  U.S. many unused doses. tried phases based priority many health care workers even old people refused get vaccinated. 

At point, set vaccine centers High School gyms large stadiums / auditoriums, get national guard army support logistics let sticking begin. Lmao way people like u/hijackthestarship respond. Social media brings worst people swear I'm sure they'd ""hope"" ""gamble"" since one shot still infinitely better nothing us have.  opinion... I'm talking California. I'm talking city within California.

There's lot red counties within California many deaths thus drag per capita downward.

But look Los Angeles, per capita death 121 significantly higher Florida's 107 This. LA resident, don’t blame anyone listening anymore. stay-at-home orders bullshit. Hypocritical politicians proclaiming indefinite, unenforced, arbitrary lockdowns aren’t effective. Small business closed large corporate malls/stores/shoots open. CA months time prepare hospitals surges we’re still fucked. snail slow vaccine rollout. Can’t blame people fed nonsense. Turns thirst recession proof. think people really discounting role media setting timelines ""normal"" normal looks. sister gets news WaPo NYT; her, pandemic say is. tell post home wanna tell what's going?  I'm skeptical businesses able return normal over. ""New restaurants open like always do!""

Won’t folk lost near dear one.. started care..? horseshit. HECK wrong there? I'm Uk country prob get vaccine till TURN i'm essential get mine till mid 2021 early Autumn. 

I'm happy people HIGH RISK getting it. Less death, turn FABULOUS. till I'll peacefully wait damn turn expect others so. degrade lawless society... like USA. Also depends size. big tamales, I'm satiated 2-3. grandma though makes small/medium easily eat 4-5 per sitting, 6+ I'm really hungry. especially there. buy tamales. 'Fall 2021' lmao even 'could'

Listening man going cost thousands jobs dont think really understands economic destruction taking place right now. 

Reopen spring/summer. Sneak attack lvl 1000. 800 coronales coming Well states like CA can't change anything moment, anywhere realistically go short arrests people public.. think immediate effect. may impact herd immunity estimates reopening guidelines peak passed.

The thing go people know recovered covid. completely fine now. rookie numbers gotta get numbers up. sour cream, diced potatoes carrots chunks soft crispy, pico de gallo, pickled slices jalapeños tons lettuce? math herd immunity work North Dakota


The CDC estimated [1 7.2 infections detected Feb Nov 21st, ND 71,500 reported cases. use CDC data, suggests ND around 515k infection already put infection rate around 68%. means close to, excess of, estimated herd immunity threshold illness R0 2 3. 

Seeing case number peaked around mid-November, I'd say everything lines quite nicely naturally acquired herd immunity ND.

Same goes SD. Work work, assign hierarchy terrible starting point conversation. Scott Gottlieb many negative PR snippets media eat pandemics? whole world finger tips, history repeated itself. difference comes hospitals aren’t severe daily risk overwhelmed vulnerable protection. daily case numbers guides risk. reality I’ve seen guesses high 5 cases per every confirmed case. lot skylights, ya? family crank 500 4 hours Def lot $$ clicks didn’t know that. % cases 65 need hospitalization?

Once vaccine widely available, doubt we’ll keep anti vaxxers Also Indiana tamale men places Someone ran math weeks ago - based total death counts, adjusted population age structure (younger US average), probably around 50%-60% infected lower bound herd immunty restrictions still place. guess makes sense.

I think J&amp;J would great vaccine young people take. Google maternal immune activation autism. copious info it. sure I’m getting downvotes lol. It’s anti vaccine - fact would say would promote infection pregnancy carries higher probability.

You weigh chances getting whatever disease is. Usually death main concern esp things like flu, although get flu that’s riskier immune activation vaccine. Covid serious SIL said possible risk vaccine less chance getting Covid baby, makes sense. loaned friend 2k help buy food truck. cooks grandmother’s recipes best food ever eaten. understanding right?

No, said all. said people gathering one immunization point sounds like bad idea could super spreader event. rate vaccine distributed pathetic...those qualify helping others vaccinated. predict right I'm slightly wrong!

There significantly demand vaccines, some, most, infrastructure available administering vaccines (pharmacies, etc). 

I like positivity! agree. also think get vaccinations faster that. One thing think one person get tested multiple times. I've gotten several covid tests myself. Agreed, legalizing would help combat trafficking, help workers organize ways could help protect bad actors. Taking away stigma would encourage sex workers need help reach without fear prosecution.

Just like drug war, legalizing would help many problems currently within industry. UK twice USA per capita level.

The doctor says one infectious diseases critical care physician, trained make public policy decisions.

then spends paragraphs talking things training experience in. said pretty stupid stuff also..  found difficult prove potential, hypothetical consequence lockdown. compare lockdown negatives positives can't possibly measure alternative? want chemicals

Much better get all-natural death virus like Gaia intended. Actual conclusions small benefits cannot excluded, find significant benefits case growth restrictive NPIs. Similar reductions case growth may achievable less restrictive interventions. that’s true, we’re also talking disease kills many people world Covid killed US alone less time. 

Your argument flawed. 

Should stay home you’re sick flu? Absolutely. limit spread flu know might exposed? Definitely. think take steps prevent spread disease kills less 1/10 people US year? No, trying insinuate would stance moronic. Okay, thanks clarifying! think worry much varients long uses spike protein sequence thing mrna vaccine work I'm professional anything first world countries normal summer, yes, agree I've always believed God gave us brains expects us use them. Looks like guy get memo. COVID-19 December. One worst experiences ever! guy irresponsible. Haha sure argument case fatality rate flawed.

The case fatality rate lower means patients taking ICU beds longer using hospital resources.

That’s problem everywhere trying avoid HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED!!

That causes unnecessary deaths go up. link Frankly, I'd rather alligator get COVID. Besides, there's nothing wrong alligator. Pretty much everyone wants normal life back, see problem that. reality though probably happens. long going around demanding reopen everything right think people taking issue saying. They're even adminstering given. criminal dealt slowly. Yes that’s articulate refutation comments expert.  There's reason advertisers care elderly people. buy lot stuff anymore. Economically speaking, inert, low economic activity.

And family loses grandparent unpaid work like child care, may need pay someone that, increasing economic activity.

And way out, elderly Covid victim probably made lot money medical-industrial complex, especially spent time ICU.

So capitalism, elderly dying probably great news. Noticed stock market better ever? That’s rotten thing say. I'm really sports guy can't help think game entertaining without audience reaction maybe sports entertaining. Yes considered that. I’m sure it’s relevant. country doesn’t many cases begin surrounded water, perhaps it’s easier lockdown work. Unlike lot states bad right North Dakota follows science logic defeat Coronavirus.

First all, millions people receiving vaccine time. Insanely rare, one-in-a-million things happen time, people die, people get sick, etc. Medscape says ITP occurs 66 people per million, per year. Divide 12 that's 5 half people per month. Roughly 5 million people received vaccination roughly past month, one report one person developing ITP vaccine seems likely sheer coincidence based many vaccines given out. 

The fact investigation done mean necessarily think link, safety prioritized every possible adverse event taken seriously, even likelihood cause low. 

Secondly, even place statistics aside assume *every single* ""post-vaccine incident"" directly caused vaccine, looking single-digit handful per million poor outcomes. Compare impossibly worst case scenario best case scenario catching COVID (and chances either dying, severe long term effects), difference still several orders magnitude. Looking post histories shit lol. you’re kind weird friend new Chicago excited first time happened every one like ""Oh yeah course tamale man"" believe something great could normal. fact interested Dr Zhang read published genome 6 days people realize.  was...

I still got recipe book - handwritten one grandchild say, Trump really trustworthy Canadians going florida vaccine aforementioned free all. Canadian provinces vaccinating healthcare long term care workers first, Florida seems like flash cash get shot. That's point - extra jabs help end lockdown quicker, bought coming time soon. vaccines expected solution end lockdown quicker, purchase ensure solution that's certain arrive, *later* options. Brexit strikes again.  probably medicare would full coverage stay hospital since admitted. probably Yes, definitely. No-Fly lists also good (which assume person this).

Similarly, published New England Journal Medicine November found “no significant differences” mortality rates 200 patients Argentina given either convalescent plasma placebo. 

Still, handful large-scale studies ongoing researchers trying pinpoint whether plasma helps specific subset patients — likely patients beginning illness already hospitalized.

**Study Description:** Research participation occurs via anonymous online survey. individuals reside Canada US adults (18+) complete study.

**Study link:** (ethical/legal):** study approved University Toronto's Research Ethics Board (2020-01). data remain confidential anonymous.

**End Date:** August 7, 2021 battle SARS Cov-2, however studies vitamin deficiency causing severe COVID-19 illness plausible. complete study needed confirmation. Particularly 96 year old bodies Moderna using nasal viral load analogue asymptomatic spread. can't shed virus present nose. Genuine Question: everyone raving figures per capita similar America's (which everybody seems complaining about)? 

Are Americans sitting doses can't administer get priority Phizer Moderna vaccines? like people working home going partying demanding everyone else stay in. Right anyone limiting activity whether they're going work not, fact would think need go would want people staying make safer going work. There’s argument would worse restrictions. obviously sucks small business/restaurant owner, don’t think there’s right NPI strategy- justifications. would best shutdowns sufficient financial support businesses. blame governments for. virus part problem. Lock. Down. Now. He's reasoning them

No, isn't. He's starting argument. really denying cannibal_steven right

There's point right one sided conversation. better society bona fide charity

Again, discussion nobody. point made, all, relation person's particular experience. Hell, Christian saying refuses tithe church, getting attacked? what, exactly? fearmongering nonsense?

There yet zero proof Covid-19 'evaded immunity'.

The vaccins work newer strains, known virus evolves relatively slowly.

And even if, takes six week update mRNA vaccines.

There need panic. Late spring/early summer 2022 maybe Wth talking UK’s coronavirus response awful. they’ve rolled vaccine bit quicker anyone else doesn’t paper fact they’ve late act every stage ! Mecha-abuelita That’s grandma; that’s abuelita! anyone Massachusetts know mass vaccination sites Gillette Fenway places going start? stfu point. Ahhh yeah forced Mexican girlfriends family lol. always provided six doses per vial..

As written [this much get one vial depends syringes used. changed recommendation syringes use, able relabel vial containing 6 changes make optics look better...

This change probably also shifts liability onto them. now, generously allowed provide sixth shot enough vaccine still left vial, together warning mix leftovers multiple vials. unable get sixth vaccination batch vials, luck. Safeway Tamale lady makes great ones although keeps pits olives. prefer Mexican Grocery Store man spicy red sauce skimp meat. I'm freaking loads yeah thanks clinical insight, seems extremely well suited public health! hhaahhaa Yeah, value unreal.

The ones I've always corn husk. Sometimes beef chicken, pork at. think right move. 

As long closely tracked first dose received given person. want situation booster different manufacturer.

This race infection rate. Suffice say months absolutely clear enough people exercising required measures social distancing, masking, travel stop infection rate increasing exponentially. hospitals collapse anything requiring critical care would fatal. 

Not storing 2nd doses without risk.  anything happens slow vaccine production train goes rails. 

Realistically though Pfizer sure able meet production demands vaccine enter chain manufacturers. highly unlikely course 21 days, possible secure 2nd dose person known need booster particular date. Hopefully booster appointments made time vaccination part standard procedure. hard logistical problem solve. call vaccine supply tracked National level, something confident happen adults room 20th.

Worse case shortage supply lead new vaccination dates pushed back rather boosters pushed back.

Secondly, shortages less less likely look populations priority groups vs. amount vaccine actually require. 

It easy get lost idea ""300 mil people needing get vaccinated"". 300 mil, maybe 210 million take it. population 300 mil say 12% 70 older. 3.6 million people. Tip iceberg, accounting large part hospitalizations deaths.

We need get smaller early phase groups vaccinated quickly possible, hospitals get danger zone soon possible.  consider holding aside doses threat supply disruption becomes threat. Honestly though, likely way vaccine open general public time, stop stalling phase 1a 1b, situation hospitals lot better. need get ASAP though. Try Latin American countries! others know aren’t dry grainy like Mexican tamales. family Salvadoran, course they’re favorite, lots people love Guatemalan Puerto Rican tamales (though Puerto Ricans call *pasteles*). Zhang Zhan Chen Qiushi released yet? Yes. I’m guessing stuff open capacity late spring early summer Regardless think Russia's politics, good see Russians open international cooperation scientific experimentation fight pandemic. People gathering matter many restrictions throw out, least restaurant provinces regulated controlled environment. 

Then there’s also moral issue forcing someone livelihood indefinite time period. Tamales always handmade.. fucked I? roommate asked 10k times stop bringing random women home. Begged, pleaded, got laughed at. We've major fights it. autoimmune clotting disorder spleen. get covid, I'm going ICU 100%. Night last brought girl over, big dinner, got good drunk spent night bedroom. already symptomatic ""just allergies!!!!"" paranoid piece shit asking leave. laughed obviously, leave.

Of course tested positive next morning. actually meant get test DAY CAME ""didn't get around it"". He's obviously fucked, fucked I? sitting kitchen drinking eating half night. intake heating central air right front bedroom door sleeping air blowing face night. I'm angry sad. stand asshole says, believe qualified provide insight COVID, want others trust words collectively get better instead worrying disinformation....so fuck saying stupid shit like makes job defending credibility much harder me? 2021 Resolutions: Take day fucking day. Hope progress, prepare chaos. much time fall. Real talk. Ive got grandmother supplies monthly we're gonna need take ~~vaccine~~ microchip back body friend worked who's wife's family visiting Mexico offered make tamales town. Word got around office orders started pouring in, know many tamales sold know cooking 3 4 days said. personally ordered 3 dozen could freeze some, true good eats. Yeah dropped semester I’m back essential worker. finally happy care free life university years struggling. OCD can’t stand masks. yeah. gonna lose it. feel like universities keep making us wear forever make germaphobe parents government happy.  think opening restaurants would help? bruh  fortunate! blue-ribbon winning grandmother never wrote best recipes, it’s loss. Yeah, weren’t sports watch lot people would’ve said fuck rules quarantine way earlier. Sports leagues minimal impact spread covid compared impact human morale. 

It’s tough tell people leave homes year, especially live city ton people taking away one remaining bastions normalcy. (Reuters) - Scammers defrauding people falsely offering COVID vaccines return payment, victims receiving unidentified jabs, Welsh health minister said Monday, echoing warnings police parts Britain. “The current level reported fraud relation vaccine remains low increasing,” said Graeme Biggar, Director General National Economic Crime Centre NCA. Britain grip devastating surge infections pushed total UK COVID-19 death toll 81,000 led imposition national lockdowns England Scotland tight restrictions Wales Northern Ireland. Can’t lot stuff reopen vulnerable elderly vaccinated? Yes. Vaccines 100% effective carry risk. think anyone denying this. Riding car carries much higher risk injury fatality, us still without second thought. can’t post post whatever reason I’ll hope one blows people see question I’m trying ask, is: 

How many covid cases *really* actually mean that. Think people who’ve undoubtedly gotten sick never got tested asymptomatic never got tested reason, etc. people think numbers inflated, think opposite—that they’re even close accurate far people know. wonder number it’ll make difference. sweet! treasure lovely lady. grandma sweetheart. Thanks pointing misleading title. honestly hate almost much Covid deniers feed false narrative everything overblown Covid hoax. 

Covid bad enough own. Many people dying, hospitals stretched capacity. need sensationalized reality. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* tried that, bugger open, UK! aren’t real lockdowns people able go freely isn’t enforced. 

In NY locked pretty good people listened back March/April. helped control spread believe saved lot lives. 

I believe Israel Australia successful lockdowns. lock see cases rising able isolate infected people stop spread  would tbh.

Gap years really good too. ended taking one undergrad one year went Law School time going bit mental crisis one ended rewarding actually boosted GPA long-run.

Part college carefree experience able make spend time friends expand horizons. Vaccinations teachers, police officers, firefighters, people 75 **starting early as** today NY. I'm getting hopeful. I've living home mom sister this. extremely careful respect mom, (65) gets vaccinated, I'll feel lot less anxious. May even return gym quick lifts.

**Edited accuracy** Sure have. technology make rapid thorough genome sequences. organisms travel across planet less day. Viruses long life existed.  sad. Shows even basically unlimited money treatments, body fight hard take much. No. I'm friend that's tired watching people die work irresponsible shitfuck muppets keep furthering plague. tamales going fire. exactly. don’t understand keeps stating stuff like this. People get disappointed. wrong! referring Dr Li, informed WeChat group December 30th China informed December 31st. fault western media leaves second part out. figured lard given mention it, yeah, can't make good tamales without lard. even know anything talking nonsense. 

The best thing come yo nationalism bad. 

India going give approval sake week festival week hence 16 extra person two speeds process lot. help grandparents make tamales every year Christmas 6 hours make 200-250 tamales including steaming them. Grandma cooks meat makes sauce day before. target always overwhelm hospitals. zero risk happening, back normal. You’re gonna lose need keep wearing mask? Yikes. 

As cases deaths go open up. Masks probably last go though. friend mine nurse NYC says even many colleagues refused get vaccine tease me, would China need seal cities want instruct patients run world?

Are westerners minds? honestly think country like US would acted differently? dependent months leading Fall 2021 political/financial issues social pushback...literally 2020 taught us anything it’s shouldn’t say shit like knowing tomorrow going bring us. Agreed, yeah. common I’m sure it’s happened bet best tamales they've ever had.  economic fallout virus causes many times price vaccination shot. pretty much clear since first lockdown, penny pinching irrational short-sighted, matter poor wealthy nation. 

I also think long term effects virus society people included calculations yet slowly seem show balance sheets that's politicians finally seem start panic. Unfortunately many months late paying price long time come. must one really big pots could bathe in. Sad true. arrest stupid asshole allready say same! I’m also Ohio. Regarding airlines: international air traffic severely restricted. certain airlines allowed fly, once/twice per week respective destinations. circuit breaker rule place: inbound flight results X number cases, whole route suspended days.

On top that: passengers must present valid green code boarding. get testing negative PCR IGm tests, submitted local embassy verified staff. Tests must conducted within 48 hours leaving. Oh, code must issued embassy country last leg flight... basically transfer flights.

On top that, arrive must complete state-run quarantine. Basically get flight, visa/passport get processed, get PCR test, shuttle quarantine hotel. choice placed. separated family (except kids - stay one parents). may leave room reason - open door get food delivery put trash. leave attempt see family member, quarantine periods restart. get tested least four times (PCR) you’re required submit body temperature readings twice day. quarantine staff member comes every day verify body temperature well.

Furthermore, length quarantine depends destination province China. minimum 14 days, quite provinces also require additional 7-14 days arrival. province live requires full 28 days quarantine anyone coming abroad.

So, yeah, I’d say they’ve got international air travel bit down.  BioNTech finds ""production hell"", mass produce anything scale before. would quite absurd. know people involved, important, larger scale things, sports - completely disposable activity impact vast majority people. actual war would incomparably worse cancellation sports event. Nah you’d dumbass drug dealer “accidentally” mix edible weed nerds rope actual one give away Halloween candy?? Like I’m sure somebody somewhere *has* done it, isn’t enough regular occurrence justify fear-mongering I’m saying. Like one cutting Fun Dip coke sprinkling heroin top Sour Patch kids whatever crazy shit middle-aged coworkers claimed. there? news? little old couple cart everything came one place worked. never brought lunch home whole time worked there. Mom's response I've told I've already eaten ""Yes, eaten eaten THIS!"" serves plate. Yesterday made red cheese enchiladas order.

China were, yes, article said ""The Wuhan hospital treated patients serious symptoms mild symptoms isolated makeshift hospitals set city height outbreak last year."" study people seriously ill. Wondering thing. read like. “Why free note worthy?”
“Is normale sane thing do?”
Then remembered America exists. 
You might seen news recently, self proclaimed bastion democracy. even lives though way? Surely increases risk? UK stsying home wsiting fir vaccine appointment invitation, 80s first. Mine due probably July! We’re close, maybe closer we’ve ever been, since end summer we’ve pretty much all. religion deserves tax breaks bailouts sort. suggest religion good mental health viewing things rose tinted glasses. China different, hospitalized everyone tested positive, even symptoms. However article said ""The Wuhan hospital treated patients serious symptoms mild symptoms isolated makeshift hospitals set city height outbreak last year."" study people seriously ill. Let's find letting Covid rampage whole population! Robert Koch institute (and anyone else paywalled) No, sub wants zero covid. Tough luck people, Japan cancel demand vaccines. Life must go on!  ""Yeah want FIRST line I'm taking it"" - says person probably even first *billion* people line

Realistically get vaccine right now, either extremely risk would fool taking it, working people extremely risk putting risk. don't.

It's advisory. extremely telling accuse ""like mentally weak"" instead discussing issue. I’m afraid ain’t doin forever. accounts, disease always us. going happen. life dying anything ever. I’ve heard people around say way telling long term effects long term usage occurs. try retort back “but know long term effects covid”, doesn’t work lol reply yall think of? understand bit nerves, cmon, enough enough right?! stored temporary facility Surrey county's hospital mortuaries reached capacity amid rising Covid-19 case rates. Surrey Local Resilience Forum spokesman said county would left ""real difficulty"" 1,400 capacity exceeded coming weeks. number patients Covid-19 hospital reached record high England, official coronavirus death toll UK passed 80,000 weekend lab-confirmed cases hit three million. We’ve 20,000,000 documented cases US (most likely 2-3x more). 80% deaths elderly population.  mean guess *need* read it. live florida probably witness travesty live. wanted read it. cool lot side effects lockdowns also long effects Life statistics. Figure statistical chance bad outcome virus getting vaccine figure want lay chips.

Lifetime odds dying car crash roughly 1 100 perspective. U.S., rules set state level, require children vaccines mandated state, states following [CDC Recommended Child Adolescent Immunization give every schoolkid vaccines anthrax, ebola, exotic diseases. side effects serious they're necessary U.S. population. 

Once child adolescent COVID-19 vaccines released widely available, yes, expect many states and/or school systems add list required vaccinations.

But states go regulatory process update required vaccine lists, political fights many states. 

The process automatic all-encompassing like suggesting.  Yep. Keep mind there's two distinct lags - one lag dose immunity, lag reporting. even nursing home residents hit threshold basically dying anymore, still deaths reported day died previous week two.

So take time effect, little time *see* effect, discouraged seem like happening quite yet looks like be. source article currently commenting on. copied pasted quote directly it.  understand mRNA vaccines can't change human DNA, know applies vector DNA vaccines like AstraZeneca, enter nucleus. explain simple terms change human DNA nucleus? Agreed. L.A, extension, America's downfall virus response individualistic culture. Poorer collectivist cultures like Vietnam done well COVID baked culture common good yourself. Meanwhile, America much ""fuck you, got mine."" *8pm ;-) love pun much case, staph much easily explained mobility decreasing 18% since beginning wave...not herd immunity. thing happened South Dakota, 13% baseline (but 14% higher baseline right wave). blame taking holiday vaccines getting approved delivered? sure could lived there. Denmark ready start vaccinations soon got them, even meant Christmas Day. Covid Denial new Holocaust Denial. think Peru example.

30% died Peru younger 60, overwhelmed hospitals lack proper medical care. Ireland, far, 19% deaths occurred people younger 75, able save many lives proper hospital ICU care. might happen hospitals can't cope. Sadly, might happen soon. Cuomo done awful job #1 Pandemics dont go away 12 months. 

#2 Government officials lie. 

Some redditors learning facts. many, common sense. mentioned hold back second dose.  Yet, distributing have. must south lol Midwest school hasn’t person since start Covid expected start date  mobility gone 18% since beginning wave. Great. brain damage anti-maskers exactly society needs right now.  think really respectable Canada's Olympians want vaccine allocation given people higher risk severe cases. sure aware this, risky speak hateful generalities. 

From Healthcare provider's perspective, please consider already COVID immunity. eligible allergic reactions contraindicated vaccine. seen coworkers go 5 day bedrest know unit cannot support everyone once. know PPE sanitizing procedures kept safe almost year point... would probably give vaccine allocation someone else higher risk could, long hospital PPE well-stocked. mean, would believe ? redditor doctor concerning health related issues ? Obviously doc. nurse I'd say believe nurse. blame believing nurses. Also dangers every vaccines weight pros cons. 

My sister works pharmacy also believe sort things like big pharma shortcuts detriment population. blame them. 

Everytime uneducated topic either rely highest authority researches, even comes difficulties finding right sources, checking two sides etc.

So convince mom maybe give sources someone better authority current cycle olympics need cancel next cycle. valid reason run all, greedy fucks forces go ahead. total number people infected bound peak positivity rate though.

It essentially looking total number people test positive per number tests performed given time frame. peak positivity rate maximum could tested positive given set tests. use lower positivity rates, population would need get tested achieve number positive increases. example, positivity rate 14%, time frame, 1.72 million people would need tested. (And peak actually 18.5% would 1.33 million people needing sake simplicity, say 20% (150k) North Dakotans test positive one day 20% also test positive 2 weeks later. That's 40% population infected.

Yes, that's used total number people infected time period rather individual day... would unique individuals?

Because positivity rate I'm using based unique individual tests, total number tests, JHU CRC approach. True, doesn't, however, counter antivaxxer argument respect vector DNA vaccines like AstraZeneca, enter cell nucleus. Apparently influence human DNA nucleus. know works? $ answer. gonna hold hand Biden get huge fat stack cash. am! appreciate kindness..

But say last 60 hours whirlwind. 

I one people pretty rough side effects. Friday morning pretty extreme pain swelling around injection site, extreme flu-like body aches.

That evening, nausea vomiting kicked persisted next morning.

Slept Saturday really remember much all, today finally light end tunnel.

Slight headache fatigue, exponentially better.

All said, still glad took would again. Lol, actually 4th. true. new variants pretty wicked. saw area UK go low control one month. Japan one right numbers skyrocketed last couple weeks. necessarily deadly contagious. *Offer valid want prelockdown lives back. Pretty sure anti-vax crowd overlaps people mask distance do. someone who's actually worried virus seems like bad take always possibility catching spreading even mask distance, voluntarily taking higher risk something say concerned about. hand allergies reason that's mentioned concern might best undesirable choices. Redditors mostly 18 25. rational wise crowd.  Moderna/Pfizer liable damages

The vaccine rolled hundreds millions people. That's lot frivolous lawsuits waiting happen people stub toe getting vaccine decide sue Pfizer hoping get anti-vax judge score retirement Caribbean.

Meanwhile actual vaccine costs $30 less, 1 100,000 successfully sues, profit evaporates fight thousands lawsuits once.

So since vaccination matter public interest, government takes risk. enough lawyers tell people bullshit claims get lost, big enough coffers pay whatever gets through. Today went CityMD covid test. person tested said antigen antibody **same** thing.

Unfortunately things happen, world sporting events took backseat WW2 5 years too. Haha- current hospitalizations around thanksgiving/beginning December. seen holiday surge. wait DC insurrection numbers start popping. can’t believe there’s vaccine. man's agenda supported God. you’re really defending Trump’s vaccine failure?  Got keep fear pump primed. come dramatic. one year what, 80? They're comparing 8 countries (which stay-at-home orders) 2 (South Korea Sweden). Strangely, include, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand paper, baffling since countries managed lockdown reopening effectively. Pretty much cherry picked 8 countries fumbled reopening loosened restrictions completely. 

This necessarily effectiveness stay-at-home orders (the authors admit they're effective); rather, looking effectiveness response Korea/Sweden countries failed reopenings. know lockdowns prevented that?

Personally think we're going see HUGE improvement well get 70%+ total vaccinated.

I think right say things relatively back normal mid year, also take rest year really come conclusion. Even 50% mask usage area, hardly flu patients hospital. steps taken try stop Covid almost completely eliminated flu. EU (446M population) ordered 300M Biontech doses. (**0.6726 dose per head**.)

The UK (66.65M population) ordered 40M Biontech doses. (**0.6001 dose per head**.)

The criticism quantity (doesn't help media clarify either suggests EU ordered less US UK). criticism US favorable deal terms delivery speed.

I'm Memorial Day weekend wedding PA, too. They're planning come hell highwater, said thing--they'll outdoors and/or cut invite list to, canceling.  There's also fact virus closely related viruses found bat populations China. Idk thread see also responded bc I’m reddit stupid question really based pure curiosity. I’m actually RN hospital we’ve fair share covid one biggest hospitals county 300k. There’s one article says “model predicts 5, 6, 7x many covid cases reported” whatever number is, question. 

If found 1/3 US population already infected, could change everything far we’re approaching expect next. thats 1mil/day right? Last update 6.8mil website vaccination tracker? First doses specifically Americans? article Australia. argued people sub saying similar percent infections long term symptoms. Oh no! mean giving virus millions permutations mutate might result virus mutating? could known!?? 

Sure glad decided sacrifice friends families economy They're reserve. Everything that's allocated far exclusively first doses. feds holding back second doses people ready them. US gov't likely around 25m ready holding Yeah, like said shut indoor dining Congress passed stimulus bill extend unemployment. Congress passed still dick. poor reporting completed tests state too, probably. first doses count first second doses given? England. Population density counts lot, New York City almost triple deaths state Michigan (39k vs 14k\_) twice cases (1.14M vs 560k). people general closer together, fewer hospitals per capita, mortality numbers worse. much social credit recieve posting message? early 20s white dude landscaping company. early 40s dude Felipe, best work with, brought tamales wife made once. fucking incredible, told so, got batch weekly rest tenure there. Really? That's nuts. I'd also imagine demand vaccine would probably higher testing I'm sure. seems every data site different info. find link Pima better play Dirty Water every time someone injected I’ve learned things always take longer think. may right, absolutely one KNOWS sure! We’re almost halfway January already. letter employer back March 2020 explaining I'm essential worker therefore eligible road stay home order. I've never asked present it, anyone else workplace--even people pulled reasons. think implication didn’t design virus kill anyone, escaped lab accident. likely trying experiment figure original SARS virus able infect human cells. wanted see types bat coronaviruses worked wild, could replicate lab.

It wouldn’t first time virus escaped research lab: literally know literally means. grow second dick know they're well people saying positive things Lamont rollout local news FB. people scum earth even can't deny it, hoping gets extra doses swung way Probably there's one left. article numbers, provider clearly overwhelmed hospital telling personal story... (also known anecdote) mindset coronavirus overblown, masks work, liberals trying take away freedom. buddy's grandma dies, easier go thinkung way admit wrong morally liable complacent deaths. Yup, ya got priorities right bub. 2m tests day. reason can't vaccines, long they're available. *ss do. gladly let inspect parking lot built hospital first recieved covid patients used stand... Fully agree. many vaccinations weekend day week. sooner get vaccinations done sooner return normal constantly blaming media overhyping spread summer.

Well yeah, there's truth that. summer constantly shown images people beach, Covid clusters originated people *outside* beaches. people going outside summer (like gatherings things), would easier get folks hunker winter. Yes, increasing, good sign. 3 days ago 30% doses administered. know. know lot Christians definitely gone anti vax   didn’t say forever. changing minor part life pandemic it’s safe again, it’s issue. 

If middle world war 3 city one battlegrounds, gonna go outside pretend war isn’t happening could shot bombed Bc war lasted 3 years? No. course not. would endure over. even get close 2m (initiations) day I'd soo happy. hope right. would easily mean within 6 months 2025 California :( Thank compiling stories; think I'll give look! 2020 high school grad myself, it'll interesting see others like say. I’m epidemiologist seems logical, right? containment measures use, stands reason contagious variants would slowly become prevalent. It’s natural selection. Thank showed us make spices uses are.

Making 50 lot work. 800 though?! sutviving crazy virus? Mad respect. Two things hope come long-term, however, people generally better hand hygiene people wearing masks public need go sick. think two small changes could big impacts line.

Everything else though....nah. can't real... I'm hoping reach 1.5m rolling average end January, J&amp;J approved February, sky limit: 2, 3 even 4m people day. They’re partnered Pfizer already make world’s best selling vaccine (for pneumococcal disease).

They’ll fine. agree, really many weekend, think highly likely could hit 1m day week dream tamales last night. sign response always real lockdown unless 100%. buy it. think also magnesium helps absorption? also think K2 MK7 one want remember correctly. lot better, good stuff I'm still astonished try get low-dose market position work.
They got kitchen-freezer vaccine compete sure, huge gamble use 12 µg? Correct, residents. anything?

Also, *a lot*? actual number basing on?  That's what, 35% used?

Even assuming (yeah, know) 9 million reserve second round, that's still 7+ million doses sitting around freezers... 


It's start gotta better. There's shortage demand point always going vocal minority speaks Facebook social media lad. shit every country. social media feed riddled garbage opinions too, mean 80% country believes it. Yes, refuse believe 80% Germany take vaccine [when 70% people U.S. willing take hey, feel free link poll says 80% Germans take vaccine. I'll wait. would absolutely incredible. hope right. think reachable 75s opening lot states Well France run gov green [people fantastic job. Please read article. perspective democracy real problem lol

From linked article: “Democracies higher probability increased human-trafficking inflows non-democratic countries. 13.4% higher probability receiving higher inflows democratic country otherwise.”

“While trafficking inflows may lower prostitution criminalized, may severe repercussions working industry. example, criminalizing prostitution penalizes sex workers rather people earn profits (pimps traffickers).”

““The likely negative consequences legalised prostitution country’s inflows human trafficking might seen support argue favour banning prostitution, thereby reducing flows trafficking,” researchers state. “However, line argumentation overlooks potential benefits legalisation prostitution might employed industry. Working conditions could substantially improved prostitutes — least legally employed — prostitution legalised. Prohibiting prostitution also raises tricky ‘freedom choice’ issues concerning potential suppliers clients prostitution services.”

Totally proves point lol. can't really blame China year thing. country entire year stop it...

It's genuinely pathetic hell. literally know ""long term side effect"" means. 0 reason slower weekend. accept that. emergency treated such. states insurance companies covering covid treatment now. Vaccines covered state, sure others. know Trump still white house right? Biden control anything till 20th... Indonesia: 1600 patients, 65%

Brazil: 10,000 patients, 78%

Turkey: 7,000 patients, 91%

Distribution sucked tho Meanwhile, people keep saying China release info covid 19 China. take well take night ive read compete absorption taken time. Yep, ""no one"" wanted wear masks socially distance. That's everywhere go, see people wearing masks inside, outside, alone cars, walking alone. one said lockdowns lead one-off, permanent long term controlled infections. nice try though. Compare contrast China's coronavirus reaction UK's willingness share data regarding new strain. UK published sequencing new strain, China arrested doctors expelled journalists raised alarm. Westerners interested finding country started pandemic almost certainly started China, specifically Wuhan. Right gap knowledge natural coronavirus found bats nature (and specific bat cave Wuhan samples appear collected study Wuhan virology laboratory), cases originated Wuhan wet market. China's refusal help investigate gap disgrace. 

The world crying independent investigation since January, Chinese uncooperative geo-political reasons always, they're predictably keen trying save face. Fuck particular. congregation, tithings. That’s thought process. cases get super low, even public health officials still say mask social distancing need, don’t see many people taking seriously.

Especially we’re year pandemic. People businesses eager get back normal. Yeah Fauci also seems one optimistic vaccine timelines everyone I've seen. said anyone wants would access April May.

Let's see happens.... think people seeing slow vaccinations extrapolating think means slow forever. three potential vaccines still way ordered (ie US could vaccinate 700m people). soon (probably April May) much supply.

250k many 2nd doses administered. That's floor. There's also doses delivered/shipped get 2nd doses. people coming today, tomorrow, probably even weekend 2nd dose doses shipped marked ""distributed.""

And dogmatic? Sure. world misinformation runs rampant, one speak accurately possible incorrect information corrected.

""The overwhelming majority"" doses first doses would fine.

I also think worth discussion governors treating them.

If feds stiffed 2nd weeks doses failed meet 20M year end promise, think I'd little gun-shy running administering doses promise feds back.

Assumed “trump causing covid issues” crowd see here. stand corrected assumptions random, choice required. suggested pandemics always handled. known many jabs (and going be) Astrazeneca one? Interesting since approved yet EU US. I'd like know plays practice That's issue though. obvious anti-Florida reporting California presently far, far worse. They're opening vaccination site, entertainment venue friendo. 30k deaths 40 million people.

.075% population. Amazing smart announce conclusion investigation even begins. They’re almost smart Russians, announce results election it’s even happened! stupid fucking desperate measure hide pathetic healthcare system is. literally pointing fingers partyers/travelers also keeping schools open (where cases come from).

Pathetic Really? I’ll ask around. I’ve banana leaves!  sure you’re getting dislikes. Sorry hear that. industry work? Well vaccination rates flu also flu season I'd say really promote flu vaccine every year. think saw CDc 49% Americans got flu vaccine last flu season. people need annual flu shot, promote hand washing rather social distancing/mask wearing posting article April 2020? Yes. sure charging someone fuck ton money sex helps whole creating bonds thing. Maybe try creating bonds instead. sure paying people friends solution better society. using brain, knows cant hoard donations nobody there... imagine hospital bill?  I'll support mandatory vaccine year two, familiar effects trials concluded. would disingenuous anyone support otherwise. Herd immunity achieved infection well vaccines, vaccines way this. death rare long term complications rarer still large group population absolutely logical reason vaccinate them, way around - cost, logistics, available doses higher risk, list goes on. would gladly get covid instead getting vaccine. Plenty studies show antibodies persist covid. I'm young, healthy guy, believe covid would really whole lot me. That's belief, share it.

I want stress idea vaccine way warranted entirely accurate. low risk individual getting covid produces outcome getting vaccine less, that's want immunize anyone decide they're wrong that. Cmon like Covid afraid Florida.... seeing close million/day? question. teach university idea technically qualify. Managed get appointment week I’m preparing get turned away door. NYC covid help line didn’t know either. states even get track trace outbreaks done correctly most, all, bailed summer.

Why hell people think understaffed health departments somehow handle sign sheets calling people come get shots- can't even properly keep track many infected people communities- beyond me.

This country still can't get people tested timely fashion. Expecting vaccine go smooth, efficient, expedient way ridiculous get go. I'm baffled people somehow thought rolling vaccine going go better rest pandemic handled  Worst per capita long time, near total ignorance mitigation efforts. Finally, Low overall population Small population centers. 

So basically yes, everyone already got it. Welp long live bullshit every Sunday North Florida. Honestly u could rob damn bank Canada local sherrifs office could even respond.  many people saying Christians need church faithful religious, what's point pastors, priests, whatever?  remember reading past article saying vaccine/science/medical companies used inject experimental stuff patients (including radioactive poisonous ones) name science back 19~20 centuries (article posted CDC) . largely americans trust vaccines.

How true statement ? vaccine? got award ton downvotes. 😂 usually involves mass graves. *Even government puts full weight behind approval, won’t come late February due nationalistic laws protect weak domestic pharmaceutical companies foreign competition.*

Is concept emergency laws Japan? Approve now, deal fallout pandemic. due aftermath 3rd wave high percentage victims nursing homes. dont think anti vax crowd problem point. SOON be.  think that's people adamant getting morning changing clothes, normal workday. that's crazy talk work pyjamas. 

my gf stuck going work now, even though got work home daily cases almost 8x lower. new state emergency weak sauce bullshit. CNN towards end video says stay least 10 feet apart in-doors. However, seen sources besides believe CNN CDC? Thanks. 1m absurd. Totally ridiculous vaccine, something end pandemic, could wasted due poor management bureaucracy. 11 million. think keep running wild UK? getting lot support sympathize you. watched announcements science around masks closely beginning agree mixed. Fauci recommend wearing mask early on. CDC still not, day, confirmed virus transmitted airborne. keep changing publications tune ""there theories"" ""further study required"". Wearing masks become like religious topic many still real proof work help, view distracts people ways virus spread.

There ER doc front lines NYC convinced think airborne transmission happening put YouTube video got millions views.

I also agree people ready label someone ""anti-vaxxer"" immediately embrace vaccine. personally take see people want take brand new medicine especially much risk. risk Covid highly concentrated elderly pre-existing conditions. Healthy 18-50 year olds simply lot risk. health care dealing sick people day would definitely take see debatable.

Anyway hang there. Yeah none means anything me, I’ll take word makes sense. live New Brunswick, Canada. similar population rural/urban mix. use North Dakota example bad things could get. Right major restrictions 184 active cases. 9 deaths total Covid.

So North Dakota good example ---- things.   live New Jersey going incredibly bad. almost can't believe, given well Murphy otherwise handled this, going badly. New York least opened 70+. Murphy story vaccination sites ""they're really sitting there"" sticking it. Wow, somebody something coronavirus thing gets control! lack wisdom humility religious leaders keep surprising me.... not...sigh... Fortunately coming. promising early stage treatments phase 3 clinical trials. go process. would expect available spring via EUA. healthcare workers 65+ everyone group wants gotten it. open everyone. It’s important shot gets arms at-risk people first. Dogma create ethics morality. Doctor Mrs. Morgan might disagree. “and” indicates two seperate people.

Yeah, two separate people named “The Queen” doesn’t makes grammatical difference you’re talking anyway.

Yes, does. There's one named ""Queen"", besides band. word 'the' word reason. grammatical function. cases (like one) presence implies one thing absence implies another. That's mean something, word 'the' meaning. I'm sure could dispute that.

I bet start pretending good conversation. 120 miles still seems like lot? find difficult reason someone rejects observations.  Satan supports this. Yes, Mexico prescribed people lice worms pill form: 

Pretty cheap well publishing false misleading information okay long public website 'for public'?

That chart complete garbage. sub wanna stay locked 2022 Israel confrim well run vaccination program next 2-4 weeks. suspect hospitalizations deaths plummet able get back near normal end February. 

It unfortunately take longer everywhere else since can't get vaccines arms apparently agree normal summer much table swear abuelas stamina sweaty minimum wage immigrant construction workers. Spanish people built different. Give rest. ball rolling now. We've already vaccinated 8 million people, that's accounting latency reporting.

Couple fact many states start releasing vaccine sectors population (people 75, etc), numbers go even faster.

Yes, faster better, ""hit reset"" meaningless bullshit people say sound cool, rivaled ""let clear"". People prescribed well parasite infections like head lice. amount vaccine would get rude Boris unfortunately I'm still baffled religious Americans still are. weird. yeah, fuck churches religious organization requesting money sitting thrones gold. Good donating something actually helps That’s totally reasonable, guess I’d back line. Every time I’ve asked they’ve said I’d basically hang around cvs 30-45 minutes get around me, risk exposure seems dangerous risk exposure getting flu shot :/ like I’m catching covid avoid getting flu $10k fine per visitor per visit churches closed time. sounding like Spanish flu far far larger impact lifespan people time.  covid antibodies natural infection don’t last long hope right. you’re lose trusted profession title keep anti vaccine bandwagon immune response vaccine different immune response covid. vaccine creates stronger lasting immune response. I’m field contact tracer Indiana. can’t believe numbers coming week. I’m worried what’s come. I’m exhausted team. last week alone feels like work phone ringing constantly case reports first instance screamed attempting interview. got call cried long time. First time I’ve cried working.

In positive news, I’m getting final dose vaccine tomorrow assured protection working. I’m worried what’s come. feel like people talk getting sicker sicker. restaurants bars still open. People still gathering. feels like people don’t care. people saw fear suffering see go ones door. people heard pleading answers regarding symptoms end someone house can’t breathe. I’m means healthcare worker. best can, there’s much leave work day wonder enough help people I’m assigned day. 

Please, Hoosier following covid guidelines let numbers scare you. Let exhaustion worry scare make changes. Please, begging you. Live Dakota. family doesn’t wear masks. Never got bogus virus. It’s politicians playing heads. election games. got wanted. Time next game mind trick.  they’re canadian... Yep, probably reporter calling around, finds place high % people refusing (or claiming refuse even expressing skepticism) make headline it.

I seen reports hospital administrators saying 70-80%+ staff taking it. would love see national numbers. Tbh time though actually remove bullshit, things people comment ridiculous won't. I'm anti virus, I've voluntarily house almost year. family yeah. They've too. 

This happy place. used love it. Lmao yeah much now. could gtfo know high risk person here. mental diagnoses previously helping. I'm depressed barely anything. 

So people. 

And I'm sure happening fuck ton people. need leave I'm afraid leave I'm even sure pandemic anymore. 

Whatever. No. false positive. Look ""covid reinfection."" There's growing number people symptoms, went hospital, recovered, tested negative, test positive months later similar symptoms. 

I reading yesterday spokesperson either Moderna Pfizer mentioning vaccine grant immunity least years. 

If worst comes worst, covid vaccine like flu shot needs taken yearly basis. ivermectin dewormer livestock another form it? Cases spiked NY NJ fatalities nearly kept up. Cases currently 2x previous peak fatalities 20% previous peak. new cases seem lot less serious, guessing found testing rather illnesses. world people still saying it’s gonna take longer summer back mostly normal getting upvoted it? Don’t mean rant mean like point denying facts something imo. It’s wack What's point WHO's investigation westerners already made mind China guilty? find anything, default answer would WHO's China's pocket they're hiding evidence. 

It's reminder racist mentality, like early days white woman accuses black man rape, gets lynched white crowd already made mind, damn evidence presumption innocence. 'No taxation without representation'

Which means want tax churches, least incentivize so. bet wouldn’t say got Covid go hospital horrid symptoms, got hospital 6 months later still yourself. need hysteria point. 400,000 people dead counting. Go ahead, get someone Covid cough mask less face. Go ahead... 1) Regularly update vaccines based prevalent strain, like flu. able quickly notice new variants enormous help this.

2) Develop better treatments people get it, doing. Bloomberg small update. 8.07mil Well think there's sufficient evidence indicate clearly one want deficient vitamin Covid. Airplanes would suggest military aircraft grounded, doubt, except perhaps one US carrier.    totally agree long term effects argument isn’t enough shut country down. point hospitals aren’t risk overrun, needs personal risk assessment. 

But I’m telling you’re going see it. You’re going see news articles, epidemiologists, etc., warning still taking precautions ‘long term effects’ still risk young. 

I don’t agree it. think get elderly vulnerable vaccinated *start* open (not fully fall probably). I’m telling it’s going talked about. combination immunity population behavior changes. feel like new recommendations talked terms new variants since spread easily. People obviously still traveling, etc., six foot distances. I'm security work eligible right work hospital considered caregiver lol let's hope so... tamales going enough pay 20 days hospital I'm 37 years old father 74, us veterans enrolled florida VA healthcare facility. father called getting vaccine said prioritized people 75+.

Today blue VA clinic called asked wanted vaccine, never even asked it. lucky partner learned make tamales scratch, mother. even lets help. Old people locked down. *Everyone lockdown*, people still dying, thousand day UK 4,000 day USA. 

The concept isolate elderly false one. still go essentials. still go doctor dentist. go grocery store. part, doing, virus widespread society, get infected things.  happened Dakotas? among least compliant states wrt non-pharmaceutical interventions, case hospitalization rates roof. bottom half states terms new cases per capita. ??

Onlyfans IPO. think estimating That's Reuters works. reputable source often paid financial companies news provide. simply reporting statement said that's largely accurate. Sure, EU USA wealthy countries probably reach herd immunity sometime 2021 lower middle income countries could take 2022 happen  thought already story months ago? Talking US, vaccines currently approved ordered, vaccinated 200M people max (accounting zero waste, be) vaccine delivered end July. means early/mid August immunity 57% population. Way short herd immunity probably demand.

If Oxford J&amp;J get approved, guaranteed likely, numbers improve lot, since we'd like 400M doses available. guarantee approval J&amp;J March earliest April Oxford. Plus distribution lag. Hopefully logistic issues giving vaccines worked out.

people showing due distrust much larger problem. side aphasia That's Thursday. Check Bloomberg, data yesterday people getting second dose. Maybe less populated strains, Covid vaccine it. mask usage, higher hand sanitizer, frequent cleaning supplies used. stops, flu come back. J&amp;J gets approved? one may need one dose, Novavax others.  J&amp;J's vaccine, production storage easier too. got first dose last Tuesday. mild side effects (headache, fatigue, chills) gone within day. arm also sore days.  Exactly Technically ask roman catholic church absolutely essential. Basically premise church entity carry sacraments etc etc therefore need go church communion stuff.

Now powerful would make primarily accessible humans err misrepresent holy word? know. sure suggests could powerful tool control populace past times.  True, lot known. example, know young athletes [have suffered myocarditis months recovering change i'd make math assumption many people tested multiple times versus everyone vaccinated twice.

Masters nursing basically includes classes informatics make qualified educated speak topic vaccines bachelors prepared nurse. That’s gave example college, aren’t tourist bars like many places Florida. people would still demand shutdowns mask mandates even herd immunity. It’s complete insanity.

They've ran total 1.4 million tests, twice population. since beginning pandemic, they've tested roughly 50% total also unfolded numbers reported testing began. first every case severe case nobody knew going on, number cases small fatality rate high.

North Dakota large first wave rest paragraph moot relates we're actually talking antibody test results show 5-15 times number people antibodies region reported cases think argument supported. also IFR studies cited.

Again, North Dakota's antibody testing results (i.e. serological testing) shows 10.7% population antibodies. That's LESS number cases. argument supported evidence comes directly North Dakota. think conclude reached herd immunity threshold think infection rate far higher case count.

There's data supports significantly higher. positivity rate, math it, serological testing. done testing specific population people self-selecting get tested inherently biased. 

It's biased toward may contact experiencing symptoms. increases chance positive case, decreases it. going wrong way want argument one area might testing health care workers another could ramp-up drive-by testing general population.

Again, wave, North Dakota tested 25% population. ""unique"" individuals. hard make argument there's ton cases 25% population got tested average twice surge. absolutely agree thrust 538 article take case count without context somewhere meaningless complicated.

Which I've put context using absolute minimum size population I've brought serological testing picture shows nowhere near 3x population antibodies virus. even antibody testing biased toward people believe SARS-CoV-2 point time. 

All all, makes sense claim without evidence support it, North Dakota anywhere 3-7.2x cases had. I'm giving data state itself. I'm running numbers based state's data. I'm going abstract ""Oh, we're going apply factor that's early testing."" I'm looking period time September now. applied February, March, April apply testing readily available North Dakota certainly taken advantage testing given much population they've tested. Literally one talking you? Georgia! Get together. leaders many churches opportunists.

We opened Q3 2019. 

We took beating Q1 Q2 2020 due lockdowns. basically broke even 2019 Q3 Q4 (Which felt huge win given circumstances).

So yea.... awesome. get first dose tomorrow super excited! That's interesting! VAT always quite high here, used 17.5% 2011 went up. nothing things like children's clothes food.

Unfortunately (in opinion) states adding low risk people mix thus could see us needing vaccinate 40-50% population get 15% risk. premise 18% mobility reduction ND sufficient reduce R0 level case levels fall 80% 6 weeks, 2 states mobility reductions never (or almost never) exceed -20% experience dramatic surges cases?

Again, going based pre-virus baseline. need go newly established baseline would months leading outbreak. difference pre-virus baseline determines impact outbreak overall. prevent outbreak. sure difficult understand rather basic concepts. time, believe states levels virus present population summer (without decreases mobility relative baseline) somehow spike exact time.

When spike hits function first second wave hits place. hard concept understand either. I'm really struggling figure seem understand basic concepts here... made first batch tamales last month, key, think, good spread dough go crazy filling, otherwise end half covered tamales like did.

I learn hard way grandma passed well mom remember made them, followed recipe bag masa. Though potential reason concern Miami doctor developed ITP 3 days bunch reports similar throughout seen studies 5-15 times range, last one high 80. antibody studies certain states showed 4-6 times many infections cases.

It makes sense lot people asymptomatic vast majority get sick. also studies show antibodies last 4-8 months. antibody studies may actually underestimate actual number genome shared courageous group researchers lead Yong-Zhen Zhang. worth noting time publication lab probed Chinese authorities “rectification"" - term many west familiar with, would fill sino watcher dread. 

Regarding new strain, thousands mild mutations. UK praised speed detected, identified informed world. UK simply advanced sequencing labs world. UK identified hundreds thousands different coronavirus mutations (150,000 last count back December). 

The last bit Chinese controlling narrative completely risible. can't believe that.

Also happened 0-2008 2012-2021 'bungling way herd immunity', check graphs many cities UK large universities. Specifically, look age breakdown cases.

[Here, example, case Newcastle, showing sum cases trailing 7 days, age group. Newcastle, university students Newcastle Northumbria Universities make somewhere around 1/3 15-19 age category term time (University starts age 19. Tested positive COVID cases age category peaked 8400 / 100,000 **per week** shortly universities opened fall students went back. Total rate 13,616 cases / 100,000 people (13.6% people age group tested positive) first three weeks October. comparison point, total (tested positive) COVID cases USA whole **for entire pandemic** 6900 / 100,000.  


We assume majority positive cases university students moving close-packed living arrangements university residences basis time correlation, fact spikes age groups 25, university data self-reported COVID test results university (Newcastle University instance 2000 reported student cases three weeks, self-reporting likely misses positive tests). would basically imply around 30-40% 18-19 year old university students two universities tested positive three weeks. given usually 1-2 untested COVID cases every positive test results (asymptomatic people low-symptom people get tested), actually likely something like 60 - 100% 18-19 year old students two universities caught COVID three weeks.

Yeah came symptoms late Feb. likely mid Feb got it. Recipes, people! Post here! (Or Grandma's address come pick couple dozen.) Wuhan hit worse way Italy was

Citation needed. Like almost everyone, clue bottleneck. read several times mRNA reactors scale well, knows. Woah Twitter comments worst.

I’m going complain sub anymore lol.

You guys rock. I'm comparing total number daily deaths state 21M people city 4M. city 4M twice daily deaths (almost 3x now).

You pad numbers much want make Florida look worse, acknowledge coastal cities major hotbeds virus, we'll never win virus. Reduce. Extremely. already know symptomatic cases likely spread (logical coughing sneezing expels virus further) yes 200 USD hour. Pretty likely likely 100% reduce there's scientific studies yet. obviously symptoms like coughing existing would reduce transmission Citation needed. weren’t welcome 13 months ago, doubtful find anything value now.  Thanks valuable topic input, tnolan182. 😂 think lot people confuses pandemic plague. Understandably I'd say...   Hand washing cleanliness, yes! Mask flu season ABSOLUTELY NOT! 

As soon COVID everyone get vaccine I’m done mask. haven’t worn mask since 1920. Don’t allow become new normal. 

I wear glasses. delivering apartment complex glasses started fogging up. almost missed step couldn’t see properly almost fell face. 

After covid mask gotta go I’m sorry  wonder many people took flu vaccine year versus years. Warp Speed engaging. seems common sense anticipate worse get infection, longer significant consequential medical effects be. Regardless flavor made using corn flour  perhaps eating corn tamales? Cheese jalapeno classic recommend yet. Another way look *infection* (not case) fatality rate steadily falling throughout pandemic. Originally estimated high 3-5% CDC studies saying closer 0.25%.

One main explanation believe testing finding cases among young healthy get sick, people would otherwise found unless testing. upshot every sick person presents case many people cases instead asymptomatic mildly ill see doctor.

538 ran article suggesting number infections 20% higher number cases? see case. Yo way earlier too. actually think April well fully open (maybe normal idk) death rate nonexistent TRIPLE That's completely misinformed. Maybe best countries like Denmark, many EU countries, vaccine roll absolute disaster - and, worse, nobody really planning fix it. Poland follows current vaccination plan, everyone vaccinated end May, yes, May 2022!
